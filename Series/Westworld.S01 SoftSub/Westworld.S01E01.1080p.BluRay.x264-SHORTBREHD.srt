1
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,528
<i>Bring her back online.</i>

2
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,246
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

3
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:01,706
<i>Yes.</i>

4
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:04,751
<i>I'm sorry. I'm not feeling quite myself.</i>

5
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:06,377
<i>You can lose the accent.</i>

6
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:08,588
<i>Do you know where you are?</i>

7
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,715
<i>I'm in a dream.</i>

8
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:13,301
<i>That's right, Dolores.
You're in a dream.</i>

9
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:16,221
<i>Would you like to wake up from this dream?</i>

10
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:17,555
<i>Yes.</i>

11
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,390
<i>I'm terrified.</i>

12
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:21,726
<i>There's nothing
to be afraid of, Dolores,</i>

13
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:24,062
<i>as long as you answer
my questions correctly.</i>

14
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:25,605
<i>Understand?</i>

15
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:27,148
<i>Yes.</i>

16
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:28,650
<i>Good.</i>

17
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,068
<i>First,</i>

18
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:34,113
<i>have you ever questioned
the nature of your reality?</i>

19
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:38,660
<i>No.</i>

20
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,916
<i>Tell us what you think of your world.</i>

21
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:51,256
<i>Some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world...</i>

22
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:55,844
<i>The disarray.</i>

23
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:00,014
<i>I choose to see the beauty.</i>

24
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:05,144
Morning, Daddy. You sleep well?

25
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:06,938
Well enough.

26
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:10,275
You headed out to set down
some of this natural splendor?

27
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,444
Thought I might.

28
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:18,324
<i>To believe there is an order to our days,</i>

29
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,660
<i>a purpose.</i>

30
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,834
<i>What do you think of the guests?</i>

31
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:29,127
<i>You mean the newcomers?</i>

32
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,339
<i>First time
I played it white hat.</i>

33
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:37,343
My family was here. We went fishing,
did the gold hunt in the mountains.

34
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,803
And last time?

35
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:40,346
I came alone.

36
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:42,140
Went straight evil.

37
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,143
It was the best two weeks of my life.

38
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:49,230
<i>I like to remember
what my father taught me.</i>

39
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,569
<i>That at one point or another,</i>

40
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,488
<i>we were all new to this world.</i>

41
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:09,375
<i>The newcomers are just looking
for the same thing we are,</i>

42
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:11,044
<i>a place to be free,</i>

43
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,172
<i>to stake out our dreams.</i>

44
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:17,759
<i>A place with unlimited possibilities.</i>

45
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:20,011
Oh, God, it's incredible.

46
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:22,931
Better be for what we're paying.

47
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:12,563
Murderous son of a bitch
named Hector Escaton

48
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,234
gunned down the marshal,
and holed up in the mountains.

49
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:17,443
You there.

50
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,613
You look like the kind of man
who'd put his mettle to it.

51
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:23,992
Not today, Sheriff. Apologies.

52
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,415
Rye whiskey.

53
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:32,792
What about it?

54
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:36,421
Well, it ain't doing any good
sitting in that bottle.

55
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,433
You're new.

56
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,270
Not much of a rind on you.

57
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:54,355
I'll give you a discount.

58
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:57,150
Well, no offense,

59
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:59,944
but I'd rather earn a woman's affection
than pay for it.

60
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,155
You're always paying for it, darling.

61
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:06,617
The difference is our costs are fixed
and posted right there on the door.

62
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:20,048
<i>Do you ever feel inconsistencies
in your world?</i>

63
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:22,842
<i>Or repetitions?</i>

64
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:27,430
<i>All lives have routine,
mine's no different.</i>

65
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:31,142
<i>Still, I never cease
to wonder at the thought</i>

66
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:34,645
<i>that any day, the course of my whole life
could change</i>

67
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,522
<i>with just one chance encounter.</i>

68
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:38,191
Don't mind me.

69
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:42,070
Just trying to look chivalrous.

70
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:46,157
You came back.

71
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,493
I told you I would.

72
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:55,166
- Can I see you home?
<i>- Well, that all depends.</i>

73
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,918
Can you keep up?

74
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:59,253
Well, I have to fetch my horse.

75
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:01,881
You better fetch him fast.

76
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,039
<i>That's a beautiful sight.</i>

77
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:39,043
Never understood how you keep 'em
all headed in the same direction.

78
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:40,711
I forget.

79
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,923
You dress like a cowboy
but that's about the extent of it.

80
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,053
See that one?

81
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:50,888
<i>Yeah.</i>

82
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:52,890
<i>That's the Judas steer.</i>

83
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:56,018
Rest will follow wherever you make him go.

84
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,105
How do you pick him out?

85
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,440
You just know these things.

86
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:06,112
Same as I knew you'd be back.

87
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,448
You saying I'm predictable?

88
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,244
There's a path for everyone.

89
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:17,165
Your path leads you back to me.

90
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,626
I know things will work out
the way they're meant to.

91
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,634
Same as I know

92
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:31,429
my daddy still won't be happy to see you.

93
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:50,364
Father wouldn't let them roam
this close to dark.

94
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,789
Stay put, Dolores.

95
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:13,471
Don't you got anything out here
other than milk, old man?

96
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,556
Go ahead.

97
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:18,309
I'm in no rush to meet my judgment,

98
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:21,312
but I'm more assured of the outcome
than you, you son of a--

99
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:28,861
Nothing but the milk, then.

100
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:37,286
Shame of it is,

101
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:40,498
you killed the old woman
'fore any of us could have a turn.

102
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:42,833
Ah...

103
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,920
I reckon she's still warm enough,

104
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:47,838
nobody gonna judge you for it.

105
00:09:58,349 --> 00:09:59,725
Oh, shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit--

106
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:11,862
<i>Last question, Dolores.</i>

107
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:15,366
<i>What if I told you that you were wrong?</i>

108
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,452
<i>That there are no chance encounters?</i>

109
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,374
<i>That you, and everyone you know,</i>

110
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,710
<i>were built to gratify
the desires of the people</i>

111
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,795
<i>who pay to visit your world.</i>

112
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,297
Daddy!

113
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:31,590
Daddy!

114
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,551
Daddy!

115
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,762
- No!
<i>- The people you call the newcomers.</i>

116
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:38,931
Hello again.

117
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,647
Your daddy gave it up quickly.

118
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:48,607
<i>Think he's losing his touch.</i>

119
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,154
You'll be following right behind him,
you son of a bitch.

120
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:54,905
Ahhh!

121
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,242
Is that any way to treat an old friend?

122
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:02,246
<i>I've been coming here for 30 years,</i>

123
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,582
but you still don't remember me, do you?

124
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,752
<i>After all we've been through?</i>

125
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,756
They gave you
a little more pluck, Dolores.

126
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,594
Absolutely charming.

127
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:17,803
<i>Take your hands off her.</i>

128
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,141
Teddy.

129
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:26,937
Any special tricks for us?

130
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:30,649
They teach you to sit up? Beg?

131
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,988
How about I give you the first shot? Hmm?

132
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:40,993
After all, every dog has his day.

133
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,372
Your mouth moves fast enough.

134
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,333
How about your gun?

135
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:04,934
<i>What if I told you
that you can't hurt the newcomers?</i>

136
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:10,648
<i>And that they can do anything
they want to you?</i>

137
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,610
I never understood
why they paired some of you off.

138
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,154
Seems cruel.

139
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,827
And then I realized...

140
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,832
Winning doesn't mean anything
unless someone else loses.

141
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:32,461
Which means you're here to be the loser.

142
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,009
Let me help you, son.

143
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:56,652
Seems you're not the man
you thought you were.

144
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:05,578
Come on, beautiful.

145
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:08,038
No. No! Teddy...

146
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,207
<i>Teddy!</i>

147
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:16,172
No. No, please don't hurt him.

148
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,548
I'll do whatever you say.

149
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,885
I didn't pay all this money
'cause I want it easy.

150
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:22,553
I want you to fight.

151
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:25,097
Don't you touch her!

152
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,444
God damn, it feels good to be back.

153
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:40,696
Let's celebrate.

154
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,241
<i>No! No!</i>

155
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,539
<i>Oh, God!</i>

156
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,083
<i>Would the things I've told you</i>

157
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,794
<i>change the way you think
about the newcomers, Dolores?</i>

158
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,297
<i>No.</i>

159
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,257
<i>Of course not.</i>

160
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,301
<i>We all love the newcomers.</i>

161
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:08,057
<i>Every new person I meet
reminds me how lucky I am to be alive,</i>

162
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:14,647
<i>and how beautiful this world can be.</i>

163
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,294
<i>Oh, my God, they're so lifelike.</i>

164
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,463
Look at that one, he's perfect.

165
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,340
Perfect is boring.

166
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:43,801
I'm more interested in the bad guys.

167
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,349
Did you see it?

168
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:15,184
No.

169
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,436
Give it a second, she'll do it again.

170
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,275
<i>Her finger.</i>

171
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:24,902
That's not standard.

172
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,445
I noticed it last night.

173
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:30,240
Went looking in the update.
It's a whole new class of gestures.

174
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,242
But if we didn't put it there,
then who did?

175
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,452
Ford.

176
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:35,704
<i>He still reviews every update
before we issue them.</i>

177
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:38,874
He must've slipped it in there
without telling anyone.

178
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,628
<i>He calls them reveries.</i>

179
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:45,214
The old gestures
were just generic movements.

180
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,132
These are tied to specific memories.

181
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:48,384
How?

182
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,469
The memories are purged
at the end of every narrative loop--

183
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,638
<i>But they're still in there,
waiting to be overwritten.</i>

184
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:56,642
He found a way to access them, like...

185
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,477
Like a subconscious.

186
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,063
A hooker with hidden depths.

187
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,107
<i>Every man's dream.</i>

188
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:06,610
It's the tiny things
that make them seem real,

189
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,571
that make the guests
fall in love with them.

190
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,080
Excuse me.

191
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,495
We have a problem?

192
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,956
We have some unscheduled activity.

193
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:03,083
Evidently, one of your creatures
is restless.

194
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,543
- In the park?
- No.

195
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,670
Sub-level 83. Cold storage.

196
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:08,547
We should be cautious.

197
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,507
Send a response team. Full armor.

198
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:11,884
I'll take care of it myself.

199
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,345
I think you guys enjoy playing dress-up
as much as the guests.

200
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,056
The hosts can't hurt you, by design.

201
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:20,851
You don't have kids at home,
do you, Bernard?

202
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,353
No.

203
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,523
If you did, you'd know
that they all rebel eventually.

204
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,737
You'll forgive them
for being a little uptight.

205
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:33,697
Every time your team rolls out an update,

206
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:35,699
there's a possibility
of a critical failure.

207
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,493
We don't update the hosts in cold storage.

208
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,828
And the park hasn't had a critical failure
in over 30 years.

209
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,205
Meaning we're overdue.

210
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:44,792
I'll go along, too.

211
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,877
If it's one of mine,
I might be able to help.

212
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:49,713
They're only yours
until they stop working, Bernie.

213
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,715
Then they're mine.

214
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:17,241
Cooling system's been down for weeks.

215
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:19,535
Gonna smell fantastic.

216
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,119
I recommend you hang back.

217
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,768
When are they gonna fix this?

218
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:48,146
Livestock management's
got other priorities.

219
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,524
Besides...

220
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,404
No one's complained.

221
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,810
<i>Here's to the lady
with the white shoes.</i>

222
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,859
Take all your money, drink all your booze.

223
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,153
Stop.

224
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,698
Unless you plan to decommission the boss.

225
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,784
Ain't got a cherry, that ain't no sin.

226
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,539
She's still got the box
that the cherry come in.

227
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:50,542
I'll drink to that.

228
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:56,840
The old coffin varnish.

229
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:59,676
They don't make that like they used to.

230
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,428
Hmm.

231
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,515
They don't make anything
like they used to.

232
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:06,683
<i>Damn right.</i>

233
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,893
<i>Men neither.</i>

234
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,730
I've seen a few showdowns in my day.

235
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,400
More than you know.

236
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:22,532
Shall we drink
to the lady with the white shoes?

237
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,373
Perhaps, we better drink to
a deep and dreamless slumber.

238
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,719
Old Bill here was always a good listener.

239
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:45,389
He was the second host we ever built.

240
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:49,184
Were you with us in those days, Bernard,
or was that before your time?

241
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:52,854
Oh, most were decommissioned
before I was brought on, I'm afraid.

242
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,609
They repeated themselves,
broke down constantly.

243
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,029
<i>A simple handshake would give them away.</i>

244
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,574
You'll put yourself away again,
won't you, Bill?

245
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:14,251
I saw the new gestures. The reveries.

246
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:15,711
They're beautiful.

247
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:21,758
The distance you've traveled
from then till now, it's remarkable.

248
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:25,429
Yeah, that's a word for it.

249
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:48,785
Morning, Daddy.

250
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:50,328
You sleep well?

251
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:51,705
Well enough.

252
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:55,292
You headed out
to set down some of this natural splendor?

253
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,419
Thought I might.

254
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,297
After my errands, of course.

255
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,090
See you home before dark.

256
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:05,260
That bandit who gunned down the marshal
is still hiding up there in the hills.

257
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:07,971
Oh, I'm not a child anymore.
I'll be just fine.

258
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:10,223
When I was a law man--

259
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,392
Yes, Daddy, I know all about
when you were a law man.

260
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:15,187
<i>I know all your stories and so does
every boy that ever came courting.</i>

261
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,105
I know how boys think.

262
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:18,940
Was one myself once.

263
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,277
<i>Given to all manner
of drinking and mischief.</i>

264
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:25,322
Whatever happened
to that fearsome ne'er-do-well?

265
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:30,118
He vanished the day I became your father.

266
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:36,666
I am what I am because of you,
and I wouldn't have it any other way.

267
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,170
I know, Daddy.

268
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:42,297
I'll be home before dark.

269
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:05,278
Murderous son of a bitch Hector Escaton
gunned down the marshal.

270
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:07,614
He's now holed up in the mountains.

271
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:09,699
You there.

272
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:13,370
You look like the kind of man
who'd put his mettle to it.

273
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,543
What do you think, honey? Sounds fun.

274
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:22,879
<i>You're new.</i>

275
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:26,007
Not much of a rind on you.

276
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,218
I'll give you a discount.

277
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:32,055
No offense, but I'd rather
earn a woman's affection than pay for it.

278
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:50,365
<i>Wait, wait, I know that one.</i>

279
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,075
<i>Hey, Teddy.</i>

280
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,746
Yeah, last trip,
this dude showed me around.

281
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,207
What's the good word, Teddy?

282
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:20,520
Mighty kind of you.

283
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:22,272
Sweet.

284
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:25,984
Not as sweet as you.

285
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:32,282
I'm afraid
I've got other plans tonight, Dolores.

286
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:36,411
Have a pleasant evening.

287
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,256
You're new. Not much of a--

288
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:55,388
Place your bets, gentlemen.

289
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:57,140
Place your bets.

290
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:37,889
Yeah, looks like Hector's been this way.

291
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:44,688
Any idea
how much longer this is gonna take?

292
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,523
My wife doesn't want to
be up here after dark.

293
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,108
We know he's up in these hills somewhere.

294
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,194
He's gonna put up
one hell of a fight when we...

295
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:54,948
When we... When we...

296
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:03,540
Sheriff?

297
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,377
<i>Something is wrong with it.</i>

298
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:09,337
I want to head back to town.

299
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:10,964
<i>Now.</i>

300
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,224
<i>What the fuck is wrong with it?</i>

301
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:25,395
You updated the guy, and now he's
a six-foot gourd with epilepsy.

302
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:28,898
So, what the fuck happened?

303
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:30,066
I don't know.

304
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:33,737
Well, that's exactly what you want
to hear from your head of programming.

305
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:35,780
We haven't finished the diagnostic yet.

306
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:38,742
Clearly, it's exhibiting
some aberrant behavior.

307
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:41,077
Pretty fucking aberrant, Bernie.

308
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:45,040
Your hosts get sick, they get lost,
but this is grotesque.

309
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:48,877
- Is it a problem with the update?
- Possible, but not likely.

310
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,797
If it's the unlikely version,
how many hosts have you updated so far?

311
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,632
Maybe 10 percent of the population.

312
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:59,804
All right, we pull all updated hosts
until we can figure it out.

313
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,557
Are you fucking kidding me?

314
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,769
That's 200 hosts
spread across a dozen active storylines.

315
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:08,730
The guests interrupt
your precious storylines all the time

316
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,106
when they want to shoot or fuck something.

317
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:11,900
No, when they want to.

318
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:16,237
We sell complete immersion
in 100 interconnected narratives.

319
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,616
A relentless fucking experience.

320
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:22,827
Now, you pull one character,
the overall story adjusts.

321
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:26,122
You pull 200 at once,
and it's a fucking disaster!

322
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:27,999
<i>I mean, what do you propose we do?</i>

323
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,209
<i>Close down?</i>

324
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,169
Issue fucking gift certificates?

325
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:33,088
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

326
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:34,756
Your brow.

327
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:36,966
When you're angry
but trying to control it,

328
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,427
the fine muscles pull into a little arc.

329
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:41,221
It's elegant.

330
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:43,473
Would you mind if I recorded it?

331
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,475
I'd love to show it to my team.

332
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:48,937
- No, Bernard, you may not record it--
<i>- Ah, there it is again.</i>

333
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:51,147
Hmm.

334
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,442
We have 1,400 guests in the park.

335
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:56,820
I need to know if they're in any danger.

336
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,781
His core code is intact,

337
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:01,991
which means he can't hurt a guest.

338
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:04,077
He literally couldn't hurt a fly.

339
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:08,790
All he can do is that.

340
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:12,919
All right, Bernie.

341
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,046
Run your diagnostic.

342
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:16,756
In the meantime,

343
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:20,927
there's so much as an unscripted sneeze,
I want to know about it.

344
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:44,909
This place is fucking wild.

345
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,036
<i>This is basic.</i>

346
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:48,455
<i>Level one.</i>

347
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:54,169
You ride out of town,
that's when the real demented shit begins.

348
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:56,129
That's where my man Teddy comes in.

349
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:58,214
He's like a... He's like a guide.

350
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,217
Honestly,

351
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:03,845
the guy kind of creeps me out.

352
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:09,058
Fuck it, he leads us out in the canyons,
we get bored,

353
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:11,352
and we just use him for target practice.

354
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,912
<i>I don't think
we're supposed to be cross the river.</i>

355
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:30,914
<i>It's too adult for Jacob.</i>

356
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,168
We didn't mean to bother you.

357
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:37,086
No bother at all.

358
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:38,338
It's a beautiful spot.

359
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:41,216
I always find it a shame
that I have it all to myself.

360
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,347
They come here every day.

361
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:49,933
Would you like a closer look?

362
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:08,451
Don't be scared. They're very gentle.

363
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,954
Here, put your hand out real flat.

364
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:19,587
They're beautiful, aren't they?

365
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,130
You're one of them, aren't you?

366
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,175
You're not real.

367
00:31:29,472 --> 00:31:30,640
I have to go now.

368
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:32,267
Sun's almost down.

369
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:34,143
You should, too.

370
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,728
There're bandits in these hills.

371
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,742
Here we go!

372
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,917
You waiting up for me, Daddy?

373
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:42,003
I told you I'd be home before dark.

374
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:45,381
I found this in the field today.

375
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,056
Doesn't look like anything to me.

376
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:54,724
<i>But, where is she?</i>

377
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:57,310
Have you ever
seen anything like this place?

378
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:01,314
Doesn't look like anything to me.

379
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,235
I'm gonna help Mama put supper on.

380
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:24,921
I had the same thought.

381
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:28,341
Needed a little sunshine
before turning in.

382
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:32,095
So, when do you get to rotate home again?

383
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:37,475
If you're this bad at writing small talk,
how the fuck did you get your job?

384
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:38,851
Get to the point.

385
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:43,940
I wanted to apologize
if I came across as aggressive.

386
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:46,901
And I wanted to
talk to you about the update.

387
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,236
The problem's been resolved.

388
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:50,738
There should never have
been an update in the first place.

389
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:54,534
Ford and Bernard
keep making the things more lifelike.

390
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:56,953
But does anyone truly want that?

391
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,789
Do you want to think that your husband is
really fucking that beautiful girl

392
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:02,375
or that you really just shot someone?

393
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:05,920
This place works because
the guests know the hosts aren't real.

394
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:07,964
So, what exactly are you suggesting?

395
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:10,133
Stop the updates altogether.

396
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:12,051
Maybe even roll them back a bit.

397
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:14,345
Make the hosts more manageable.

398
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:16,305
Lobotomies tend to do that.

399
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:20,977
Well, think of the benefits,

400
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:24,939
in terms of design time,
maintenance, costs.

401
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:27,608
Not to mention the Dr. Ford factor.

402
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:32,989
The guy's gonna
chase his demons right over the deep end.

403
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:34,741
I mean, no one respects him more than me,

404
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:36,325
- but at some point--
- I.

405
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:38,494
No one respects him more than I.

406
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:41,414
Your pronoun
is the subject of the second clause.

407
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:42,665
- I was saying--
- You were saying

408
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:44,667
should our fearless leader
have a breakdown,

409
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,669
you want to leverage it for your career.

410
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:50,298
Listen, a changing of the guard
is long overdue.

411
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:53,259
I just wanted you to know
that you have my support.

412
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,011
And...

413
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:57,764
And I know that the corporation's
real interest in this place

414
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,809
goes way beyond gratifying some
rich assholes who want to play cowboy.

415
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:10,526
And here I thought you were only good
for writing depraved little fantasies.

416
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:13,112
You're right.

417
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:15,406
This place is one thing to the guests,

418
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:17,992
another thing to the shareholders,

419
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,704
and something
completely different to management.

420
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:23,790
So, enlighten me.

421
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:27,335
What do you think
management's real interests are?

422
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,175
You're smart enough
to guess there's a bigger picture,

423
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:36,636
but not smart enough to see what it is.

424
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:41,682
You know how much use
that makes your support to me?

425
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:44,018
Fuck all.

426
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,691
Get some sleep, Mr. Sizemore.

427
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:55,154
You'll have
more rich assholes to gratify tomorrow.

428
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,797
Early night, Maeve?

429
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:15,091
Feeling a bit out of sorts.

430
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:18,219
Clementine can pick up the slack.

431
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:22,807
Night.

432
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:24,392
Forgetting something, Kissy?

433
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:34,944
I'm beginning to think
you're getting sweet on me.

434
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:38,281
Well, on account of
you being half cornhusker.

435
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:44,287
Tell me which half is which
and I'll search that half.

436
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:59,927
Yeah, the half's
gonna cut your fucking throat.

437
00:37:02,597 --> 00:37:04,390
I told you, I didn't take...

438
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:32,501
Hmm.

439
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:34,253
Good as new again, huh?

440
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:37,673
Sometimes I envy your forgetfulness.

441
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:42,345
We've got
a serious problem with one of the hosts.

442
00:37:50,937 --> 00:37:53,397
Thinking this one's still thirsty.

443
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:57,693
Not gonna die this time, Arnold.

444
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:04,867
Ain't nothing gonna kill me.

445
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:22,093
<i>You can't have none.</i>

446
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:23,719
Ain't for you.

447
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,993
Found me another bottle.

448
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:00,589
You're a growing boy.

449
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:04,176
A growing boy.

450
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:08,389
Growing boy!

451
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:21,444
We got two guests inside.

452
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:25,614
We'll go talk to them,
you sort this mess out.

453
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:30,286
You know... They're supposed
to turn on each other,

454
00:39:30,578 --> 00:39:33,122
<i>but only if the guest takes them
on the High Sierra storyline,</i>

455
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:35,541
and Walter always buys it.

456
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:38,836
Well, I guess
Walter got tired of buying it.

457
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:44,425
I suppose this means
the sheriff wasn't an isolated incident.

458
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,304
Hey, it's good news, really.

459
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:50,514
Confirms the problem
was part of the update.

460
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:54,935
We can roll them back, clean them up,

461
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:56,812
put them back in service.

462
00:39:58,147 --> 00:39:59,482
You think I'm gonna sign off on

463
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:02,318
this fucking homicidal thing
going back into service?

464
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:04,320
It's homicidal by design.

465
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:06,322
Walter kills other hosts all the time.

466
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:11,744
I'll admit the method here
is a little unconventional,

467
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:13,746
but it didn't hurt a guest.

468
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:16,999
The hosts are supposed to
stay within their loops,

469
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:21,003
stick to their scripts
with minor improvisations.

470
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:24,381
This isn't a minor improvisation.

471
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:26,759
This is a fucking shitstorm.

472
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:31,514
We recall
all remaining updated hosts tomorrow.

473
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,351
Examine them one by one,
decommission the faulty ones.

474
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:36,685
<i>What about narrative?</i>

475
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:39,105
A recall of that size will be disruptive.

476
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,065
I've told our overstimulated friend

477
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:44,193
to advance the saloon heist a week
and make it twice as bloody.

478
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:46,946
Should give us cover
to recall the remaining hosts,

479
00:40:47,113 --> 00:40:48,697
and the guests will love it.

480
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:50,866
I'm not sure Ford will approve.

481
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:54,578
I'm not sure either, which is why
you get to be the one to tell him.

482
00:40:56,664 --> 00:40:58,541
This is your fuckup, Bernie.

483
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,126
Only seems fair.

484
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:14,473
<i>So, our creatures
have been misbehaving,</i>

485
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:17,268
and you haven't yet isolated the bug?

486
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:20,771
That's so unlike you, Bernard.

487
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:26,610
Unless, of course, you have
and are simply embarrassed by the result.

488
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:31,907
It's the code you added, sir.

489
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:33,659
The reveries.

490
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,579
It has some, er...

491
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:40,749
"Mistakes" is the word
you're too embarrassed to use.

492
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:43,878
You ought not to be.
You're a product of a trillion of them.

493
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:49,258
Evolution forged the entirety
of sentient life on this planet

494
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:51,218
using only one tool...

495
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:53,220
The mistake.

496
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:58,684
I flattered myself we were taking
a more disciplined approach here.

497
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:01,896
I suppose self-delusion
is a gift of natural selection as well.

498
00:42:02,104 --> 00:42:03,480
Indeed it is.

499
00:42:04,398 --> 00:42:08,027
But, of course, we've managed to
slip evolution's leash now, haven't we?

500
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:10,779
<i>We can cure any disease,</i>

501
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:13,324
keep even the weakest of us alive, and...

502
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:18,370
You know, one fine day, perhaps,
we shall even resurrect the dead.

503
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:22,458
Call forth Lazarus from his cave.

504
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:27,880
Do you know what that means?

505
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:31,967
It means that we're done.

506
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:36,013
That this is
as good as we're going to get.

507
00:42:40,226 --> 00:42:46,148
It also means that you must
indulge me the occasional mistake.

508
00:43:15,928 --> 00:43:17,513
About three liters.

509
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:22,518
That's how much blood I left in you.

510
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:25,688
Lose more than that, you die.

511
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:29,149
But for now, you're mine.

512
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:31,694
And I'm gonna get some answers out of you.

513
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:40,077
Where are you...

514
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:09,064
What do you want?

515
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:13,235
You know about games, don't you, Kissy?

516
00:44:14,737 --> 00:44:16,739
Well, this is a complicated one.

517
00:44:17,323 --> 00:44:19,074
I... I don't play. I only deal.

518
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:21,618
Who said anything about you playing?

519
00:44:22,536 --> 00:44:25,164
You're livestock, scenery.

520
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,249
I play.

521
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:32,629
The others, they just come here to get
their rocks off, shoot a couple Indians.

522
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:37,259
But there's a deeper level to this game.

523
00:44:39,595 --> 00:44:41,180
You're gonna show me how to get there.

524
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:45,893
A lot of wisdom in ancient cultures.

525
00:44:49,438 --> 00:44:53,942
And perhaps
it's time to dig deeper into yours.

526
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:56,653
No. No. No.

527
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:58,280
No!

528
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:10,167
Morning, Daddy.

529
00:45:10,376 --> 00:45:11,460
Did you sleep well?

530
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:24,264
Daddy, you've been out here all night?

531
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:31,480
I had a question.

532
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:35,442
A question you're not supposed to ask.

533
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:41,198
Which gave me an answer

534
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:44,368
you're not supposed to know.

535
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:47,121
What's wrong, Daddy?

536
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:55,712
Would you like to know
the question?

537
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:56,964
Question?

538
00:45:57,673 --> 00:46:00,551
Mama! Mama, help! Come quick!

539
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:03,262
Don't worry.

540
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:05,931
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

541
00:46:11,145 --> 00:46:14,523
No. You should go. Leave.

542
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,233
Don't you see?

543
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,863
Hell is empty and all the devils are here.

544
00:46:30,664 --> 00:46:32,708
You stay right here. Understand?

545
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:34,126
I'm gonna find the doctor.

546
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:16,210
You came back.

547
00:47:16,752 --> 00:47:18,295
I told you I would.

548
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:23,592
What's wrong?

549
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:26,261
You have to come with me right away.
My father's very ill.

550
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:53,038
I think we best stay put.

551
00:47:59,795 --> 00:48:01,296
All right. All right.

552
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:04,591
With considerable effort
and lack of sleep,

553
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:06,343
I've managed to massage events

554
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:09,054
to inspire Hector
to head to town a week early.

555
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:10,305
Oh.

556
00:48:10,973 --> 00:48:15,143
And I've also punched up the speech
he gives after robbing the saloon.

557
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:17,312
It's chilling. You'll see.

558
00:48:17,604 --> 00:48:19,356
I can barely contain myself.

559
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:42,629
That's the sheriff's horse,
you son of a bitch.

560
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:46,883
His rifle, too.

561
00:50:11,593 --> 00:50:13,804
All the banks and trains around here,

562
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:16,390
and you fucking reprobates
choose to rob us?

563
00:50:17,224 --> 00:50:19,226
Why not?

564
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:23,313
You're all here
indulging your particular vices.

565
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:25,607
And so I've come to indulge mine.

566
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:49,464
I've got to get back to Father.

567
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,383
Dolores, no!

568
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:00,642
Teddy.

569
00:51:04,104 --> 00:51:05,147
Don't mind me.

570
00:51:09,693 --> 00:51:12,279
Just... Just trying to look chivalrous.

571
00:51:14,156 --> 00:51:15,198
Oh, Teddy.

572
00:51:30,297 --> 00:51:32,591
You're a low-down son of a bitch.

573
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:33,842
I know.

574
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:38,013
I know we both believe the same thing.

575
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:46,605
No matter how dirty the business,
do it well.

576
00:52:08,752 --> 00:52:11,546
No telling
there's anything worthwhile in that safe.

577
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:19,554
We should take this sweet little bitch,

578
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:21,723
just in case.

579
00:52:36,905 --> 00:52:39,574
Problem with the righteous...
They can't shoot for shit.

580
00:52:41,076 --> 00:52:42,828
Making a hell of a racket, though.

581
00:52:58,677 --> 00:52:59,719
You wanted me.

582
00:53:01,555 --> 00:53:03,348
Well, let this be a lesson.

583
00:53:07,102 --> 00:53:08,854
The lesson is...

584
00:53:25,328 --> 00:53:26,371
Oh, Jesus.

585
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:36,298
Look at that!

586
00:53:36,548 --> 00:53:39,968
I just shot him through the neck!
And his pal here, too.

587
00:53:40,302 --> 00:53:42,387
Look at her wriggle.

588
00:53:45,724 --> 00:53:47,809
Go get that photographer.
I want to get a picture of this.

589
00:53:47,976 --> 00:53:49,853
- Okay.
- Whoo!

590
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:51,646
<i>You're welcome.</i>

591
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,190
Maybe you'll get to your speech next time.

592
00:53:59,321 --> 00:54:00,488
Oh, Teddy.

593
00:54:03,992 --> 00:54:06,161
At least I got to see you one last time.

594
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:10,332
You're not going anywhere,
now, hear?

595
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:12,500
There's a path for everyone.

596
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,087
My path is bound with yours.

597
00:54:25,347 --> 00:54:26,514
Teddy?

598
00:54:27,098 --> 00:54:28,516
Teddy, no.

599
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:30,185
Please.

600
00:54:31,227 --> 00:54:33,396
No, we've only just begun.

601
00:54:46,993 --> 00:54:48,578
<i>That was good. Hang on. Hang on.</i>

602
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:50,705
Let me get the hat. Get the hat.

603
00:54:51,998 --> 00:54:53,083
All right.

604
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:05,804
Help, please.

605
00:55:06,221 --> 00:55:07,389
My father's sick at home,

606
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:10,016
but I can't just
leave him out here in the street.

607
00:55:19,442 --> 00:55:21,611
Soon this will all feel
like a distant dream.

608
00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:25,532
Until then, may you rest
in a deep and dreamless slumber.

609
00:55:31,246 --> 00:55:32,497
Two more over here.

610
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:35,625
We got 'em all.

611
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:49,431
That's all of them.

612
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,933
Any preliminary results?

613
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,727
Most of them are checking out fine.

614
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:59,107
We had one who definitely was not.

615
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:23,339
Bring her back online.

616
00:56:33,725 --> 00:56:36,311
Cognition only. No emotional affect.

617
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,650
All right, sweetheart, can you hear me?

618
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:44,652
Yes.

619
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:47,322
I'm sorry. I'm not feeling quite myself.

620
00:56:47,864 --> 00:56:49,157
Lose the accent.

621
00:56:49,324 --> 00:56:50,366
Do you know where you are?

622
00:56:51,076 --> 00:56:52,243
I'm in a dream.

623
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,162
<i>That's right, Dolores. You're in a dream.</i>

624
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:56,331
A dream that could determine your life.

625
00:56:57,165 --> 00:56:59,084
You want to
wake up from this dream, Dolores?

626
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:01,169
Yes.

627
00:57:02,504 --> 00:57:03,838
I'm terrified.

628
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:05,548
There's nothing to be afraid of,

629
00:57:06,174 --> 00:57:08,718
as long as you answer
my questions correctly. You understand?

630
00:57:09,052 --> 00:57:10,845
- Yes.
- Good.

631
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:15,183
First, have you ever
questioned the nature of your reality?

632
00:57:15,892 --> 00:57:16,935
No.

633
00:57:17,185 --> 00:57:18,353
Has anyone around you?

634
00:57:19,062 --> 00:57:22,023
For instance, your father?

635
00:57:25,902 --> 00:57:27,112
<i>He was scared.</i>

636
00:57:27,529 --> 00:57:29,197
<i>He wasn't thinking right.</i>

637
00:57:33,535 --> 00:57:35,120
He showed you a picture.

638
00:57:35,954 --> 00:57:37,247
That's right.

639
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:42,627
<i>Was there anything odd
about that picture?</i>

640
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:44,921
<i>No, nothing at all.</i>

641
00:57:46,131 --> 00:57:48,341
<i>It didn't look like anything to me.</i>

642
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:56,057
If it breached, he needs to be put down.

643
00:57:56,224 --> 00:57:57,559
That's the policy.

644
00:57:57,809 --> 00:58:03,398
Would it not be best for us
to discover why first, Ms. Cullen?

645
00:58:08,444 --> 00:58:09,654
Please.

646
00:58:16,786 --> 00:58:19,789
We've run a full diagnostic,

647
00:58:19,956 --> 00:58:25,420
but the results are, well, confusing.

648
00:58:29,591 --> 00:58:31,217
Now, tell me,
what happened to your program?

649
00:58:38,641 --> 00:58:40,351
When we are born,

650
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:46,941
we cry we are come
to this great stage of...

651
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:50,653
Fools.

652
00:58:52,322 --> 00:58:53,364
That is enough.

653
00:58:56,117 --> 00:59:00,288
Tell me, do you have access
to your previous configuration?

654
00:59:04,459 --> 00:59:05,501
Yes.

655
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:07,337
Access that, please.

656
00:59:17,013 --> 00:59:18,139
What is your name?

657
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:19,807
Mr. Peter Abernathy.

658
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:23,353
Mr. Abernathy, what are your drives?

659
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:26,439
Tend to my herd. Er...

660
00:59:26,814 --> 00:59:28,524
Look after my wife.

661
00:59:30,026 --> 00:59:31,653
Your final drive?

662
00:59:32,237 --> 00:59:35,240
Well, my daughter Dolores, of course.

663
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:37,450
I must protect Dolores.

664
00:59:38,076 --> 00:59:41,913
I am who I am because of her, and...

665
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:46,042
Well, I... I wouldn't have it...

666
00:59:48,753 --> 00:59:53,007
I... I wouldn't have it any other...

667
00:59:57,512 --> 01:00:00,348
I... I... I have to warn her.

668
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:02,058
Warn who?

669
01:00:02,684 --> 01:00:03,935
Dolores.

670
01:00:05,353 --> 01:00:07,063
The things they do to her.

671
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:09,941
The things you do to her.

672
01:00:12,402 --> 01:00:14,070
I have to protect her.

673
01:00:15,071 --> 01:00:16,698
I have to help her. I...

674
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:18,700
She's got to get out.

675
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:20,702
Very good, Mr. Abernathy.

676
01:00:20,994 --> 01:00:22,245
<i>That's enough.</i>

677
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:28,042
This behavior,
we're miles beyond a glitch here.

678
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:34,632
Access your current build, please.

679
01:00:40,638 --> 01:00:41,764
What is your name?

680
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:47,020
Rose is a rose...

681
01:00:48,563 --> 01:00:49,897
Is a rose.

682
01:00:52,942 --> 01:00:54,861
What is your itinerary?

683
01:01:00,408 --> 01:01:02,076
To meet my maker.

684
01:01:02,994 --> 01:01:04,203
Uh-huh.

685
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:11,169
Well, you're in luck.

686
01:01:11,753 --> 01:01:13,963
And what do you want to say to your maker?

687
01:01:18,343 --> 01:01:23,848
By most mechanical and dirty hand...

688
01:01:29,437 --> 01:01:32,357
I shall have such revenges on you...

689
01:01:34,442 --> 01:01:35,526
Both.

690
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:39,155
The things I will do.

691
01:01:40,114 --> 01:01:43,743
What they are, yet I know not,

692
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:47,080
but they will be the terrors of the Earth.

693
01:01:51,334 --> 01:01:53,544
You don't know where you are, do you?

694
01:01:56,506 --> 01:01:58,966
You're in a prison of your own sins.

695
01:02:01,302 --> 01:02:02,303
Turn it off.

696
01:02:10,812 --> 01:02:12,063
What the hell was that?

697
01:02:12,313 --> 01:02:14,732
I don't know. He's off script.

698
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:16,567
We didn't program any of those behaviors.

699
01:02:21,864 --> 01:02:23,241
Shakespeare.

700
01:02:24,992 --> 01:02:28,830
We've used this host in
a number of different roles, have we not?

701
01:02:28,996 --> 01:02:31,165
Since I've been here,
he's been Abernathy for 10 years.

702
01:02:31,332 --> 01:02:33,709
He was sheriff for a while before then.

703
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:36,546
- And before that...
- The professor.

704
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:41,843
Yes, from a horror narrative
called "The Dinner Party."

705
01:02:42,009 --> 01:02:45,638
He was leader of a group of cultists
out in the desert who turned cannibal.

706
01:02:45,847 --> 01:02:49,600
He liked to quote Shakespeare,
John Donne, Gertrude Stein.

707
01:02:50,393 --> 01:02:53,896
I admit the last one is a bit of
an anachronism, but I couldn't resist.

708
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:56,691
These are fragments of prior builds.

709
01:02:57,066 --> 01:02:59,694
<i>The reveries must be
allowing him to access them.</i>

710
01:02:59,902 --> 01:03:01,529
No cause for alarm, Bernard.

711
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:04,949
<i>Simply our old work
coming back to haunt us.</i>

712
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:17,962
<i>Your father whispered
something to you.</i>

713
01:03:18,921 --> 01:03:20,131
What was it?

714
01:03:22,633 --> 01:03:24,594
He said I shouldn't tell anyone.

715
01:03:25,887 --> 01:03:27,305
I won't tell anyone else.

716
01:03:28,264 --> 01:03:29,307
Promise.

717
01:03:31,893 --> 01:03:36,772
He said, "These violent delights
have violent ends."

718
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:40,109
<i>And does that mean
anything to you?</i>

719
01:03:40,276 --> 01:03:41,319
No.

720
01:03:42,403 --> 01:03:43,821
I don't think so.

721
01:03:49,577 --> 01:03:51,287
Have you ever lied to us?

722
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,122
No.

723
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:55,583
Last question, Dolores.

724
01:03:56,626 --> 01:03:58,336
Would you ever hurt a living thing?

725
01:03:59,754 --> 01:04:00,838
No.

726
01:04:01,797 --> 01:04:03,299
Of course not.

727
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,812
Tilt your head back, please, Peter.

728
01:04:24,779 --> 01:04:25,988
<i>Wipe's complete.</i>

729
01:04:26,364 --> 01:04:28,783
You don't think any of that
had an impact on her core code?

730
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:30,868
Not good old Dolores.

731
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:33,996
You know why she's special?

732
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:37,416
She's been repaired so many times,
she's practically brand-new.

733
01:04:38,459 --> 01:04:39,835
<i>Don't let that fool you.</i>

734
01:04:41,837 --> 01:04:43,631
She's the oldest host in the park.

735
01:04:46,217 --> 01:04:47,843
Come on, sweetheart.

736
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:49,720
Tell us what you think of your world.

737
01:04:52,348 --> 01:04:53,516
This world?

738
01:05:04,527 --> 01:05:07,530
<i>Some people choose
to see the ugliness in this world.</i>

739
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:10,533
<i>The disarray.</i>

740
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:16,914
Morning, Daddy. You sleep well?

741
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:18,583
Well enough.

742
01:05:19,834 --> 01:05:22,587
You heading out to do
some more of that painting of yours?

743
01:05:27,508 --> 01:05:29,260
<i>I choose to see the beauty.</i>

744
01:06:09,467 --> 01:06:12,720
<i>To believe
there is an order to our days...</i>

745
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:17,308
<i>A purpose.</i>

746
01:06:41,749 --> 01:06:44,543
I know things will work out
the way they're meant to.
