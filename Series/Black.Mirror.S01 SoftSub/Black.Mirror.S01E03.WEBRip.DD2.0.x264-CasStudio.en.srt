It's much more of a...

So if we invite you
to stay with the

what we'd have you to is pull

30
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,260
an exhaustive re-do with
personnel maybe next week?

31
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,740
Oh, well, I, I was ready to do
a big re-do right now, but...

32

No, no, no, it's fine,
next week's fine.

aren't gonna hit anything to

freak us out are they?

35
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,380
They're not, there's no major
deletions this quarter?

36
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,140
No, no, everything's
well within parameters.

stay over and I caught

102

- Hello.

So how was the appraisal?

105
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,420
Well, they said they'd let me
do a re-do sometime next week,

106
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,380
so...

107
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,580

00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,180
Okay.

111
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,340

Yeah, you'd remember meeting
Jeff, 'cause he would have shown

123
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,500
you, I don't know, a re-do
of the side of this fridge,

124
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,780

Ah, well, she's like that.

129
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,180

137
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,940

Before we started up the Kings.

140
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,300
So...

141
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,980
Yeah.

142
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,380
So, Liam, what, what,
what was it you had?

143
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,020
Assessment?

144
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,340
Appraisal.

145
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,740
How'd it go?

146
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,660
Good.

147
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,700
Well, it was, it was a disaster
but, you know, I, I don't know.

148
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,500
- Hard to gauge?
- Yeah.

149
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,940
Well let's have a look, re-do,
we can appraise the appraisal.

150
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,620
(LAUGHS)

151
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,100
Yeah, right.

152
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,460
Throw it up there
and we can grade you.

153
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,380
- Er...
- Yeah, come on.

154
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,100
Well, it could be fun,
we could... vote!

155
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,180
- Paul?
- Yeah?

156
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,940
(JEFF) And I work in
recruitment actually so it

157
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,020
might be quite useful
for you, going forward.

158
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,820
Right, okay.

159
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,980
Liam's gonna re-do his appraisal
so we can give him marks.

160
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,020
Notes.

161
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,300
Well, no pointers, you know.

162
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,380
I think Liam would probably...

163
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,940
Yeah, do you know what, guys...

164
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,540
Hey, guys. Now come on
seriously, that's not cool.

165
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,460
I mean Liam's obviously
uncomfortable so let's just...

166
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,660
...drop it, yeah?

167
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,700
Have a cool time.

168

175
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,580
I haven't met him before have I?
Jonas is it?

176
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,780
He's one of the old crowd.

177
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,420
I think I said.

178
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,660
Oh.

179
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,380
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

180
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,740
You know if you're not
in the mood we can go.

181
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,980
No, no, I'm fine.

182
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,740
Sure?

183
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,260
Hey.

184
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,780
(JONAS) Oh, no, I bought
enough for others to share.

185
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,260
Thank you.

186
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,940
I've been cooking a
lot since the break-up.

187
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,980
Jonas has had a tough one.

188
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,140
(DOOR BELL)

189
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,620
(COLLEEN) Was it bad?

190
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,460
Yeah, yeah.

191
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,140
We were in the middle of
planning it all and I suddenly

192
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,580
realised that the less
the relationship means

193
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,980
the more you spend on
the wedding, you know.

194
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,900
You actually start obsessing
over, over the tiniest little

195
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,460
details, like, like the
thickness of the wedding

196
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,300
invitation paper, 'cause I mean
God knows you need something

197
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,980
to fucking talk about!

198
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,940
So everybody, this
is Hallam, Hallam, Jonas.

199
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,420
- Hi.
- Hi.

200
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,100
And everyone!

201
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,500
- Hi.
- Hello.

202
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,220
(LUCY) Help yourself.

203
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,660
Jonas was just explaining why
relationships are a sham.

204
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,860
Are they? Shit!

205
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,940
They're like going
to the theatre.

206
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,460
You pay loads to go and
ultimately you're wasting

207
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,140
your entire night,
so when someone asks you

208
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,980
"Did you have a good time?"

209
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,380
you both say "Yeah" you know,
"Yeah, it was great", but the

210
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,820
problem is the more that you
pay, and the longer it goes on,

211
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,660
the more you're "Oh, yeah we
really loved it", you know,

212
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,220
"We, we love being together
and never fucking anyone

213
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,860
else and only having just
one other person to share

214
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,740
our real thoughts with
for our entire lives".

215
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,460
I mean, yeah, it's great.

216
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,660
Would you say you
loved her though?

217
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,460
I just think we just
really fancied each other,

218
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,180
and that was what it was.

219
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,460
You know what it's like early
on, you know, we were just, I

220
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,100
don't know, we're just two tools
in a tool shed that just fit

221
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,100
together really fucking well.

222
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,660
I mean still by the end I'd be
like "Go on, honey, you go up,

223
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,580
I'm just gonna watch a little
bit more of the news", and I'd

224
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,060
find myself, you know, watching
re-does of like hot times in

225
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,780
earlier relationships.

226
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,540
(LUCY) Easy!

227
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,980
I'm just saying, there's a
beautiful woman upstairs,

228
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,860
you know, waiting to
have sex with me...

229
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,700
What, right now?

230
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,020
(LAUGHTER)

231
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,340
She's upstairs you know
waiting to have sex with me,

232
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:28,020
and I'm sat downstairs watching
re-does of like some hot

233
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,860
times with some hot girl that
I'd just picked up in some

234
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,380
place, and I'm fucking pulling
myself off. I mean, seriously.

235
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,300
Ah, come on.
Come on, guys, I mean,

236
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,860
we all scroll through
the grain rifling through our

237
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,980
greatest hits for a little bit
of filth now and then, surely?

238
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,260
Not me.

239
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,460
Hallam doesn't have a grain.

240
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,060
(PAUL) Oh, wow.

241
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,820
No shit.

242
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,300
Is that a political thing?

243
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,300
No, no, I was gouged
about 12 months ago.

244
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,140
Jesus, was that painful?

245
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,580
Total agony.

246
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,660
But on the plus of that, I
don't remember it that clearly.

247
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,260
There's a scar in here.

248
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,260
Yeah?

249
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,740
Can I...?

250
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,660
Yeah, it feels quite nice.

251
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,820
And no brain damage clearly.

252
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,900
Well, my sight held on fine.

253
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,740
(JONAS) So who took it then?

254
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,300
(HALLAM) Stolen to order,
as far as they could tell

255
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,620
probably to some
millionaire Chinese perv.

256
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,380
- (JONAS) Really?
- Yeah.

257
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,700
Is that for real?

258
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,460
Yeah, and none of it
was encrypted, so...

259
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,620
So they saw the lot?

260
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,220
But the thing is after I was
gouged I didn't have one for a

261
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,540
few days and then
just kind of liked it.

262
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,940
(JONAS) It's cool, it's cool,
I mean because more people,

263
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,980
I mean it's
a big thing now right?

264
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,460
Like, going grainless?

265
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,780
(COLLEEN) I believe
it's huge with hookers.

266
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,860
I mean, no offence!

267
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,100
No, no, it's okay.

268
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,420
Well, I'm pretty boring.
One man at a time.

269
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,940
Boo!

270
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,700
Serial monogamist.

271
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,140
I'm a serial monogamist.

272
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,900
I'm staying faithful to
my cornflakes right now.

273
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,020
(LAUGHTER)

274
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,940
Well I think it's an interesting
choice, going grainless.

275
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,580
It's a brave choice.

276
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,860
I'm sorry, but...

277
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,180
I couldn't do it.

278
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,860
Uh-huh.

279
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,140
Okay, I was gonna
play some re-does

280
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,300
from the Fraser Road days.

281
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,860
Yey!

282
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,020
Stuff from the last
night, depressing or fun.

283
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,180
(COLLEEN) You know half the
organic memories you have are junk.

284
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,500
Just not trustworthy.

285
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,300
Colleen works in
grain development.

286
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,100
With half the population,
you can implant false memories

287
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,620
just by asking leading
questions in therapy.

288
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,540
You can make people remember
getting lost in shopping malls

289
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,460
they never visited, getting
bothered by paedophile baby

290
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,620
sitters they never had.

291
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,540
I'm just happier now.

292
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,540
<i>(REWINDING)</i>

293
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,020
<i>Okay, great, Liam,</i>

294
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,820
<i>this has been,
this has been really great.</i>

295
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,540
<i>We really hope to look
forward to seeing you again.</i>

296
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,820
He looks forward to seeing
you again, that's good.

297
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,140
Hopes to look forward.

298
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,740
<i>We really hope to look forward
to seeing you again.</i>

299
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,260
It's phoney.

300
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,420
Hang on, pause it.

301
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,460
Now back up.

302
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,700
Zoom in there.

303
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,900
Come on, that's a tick.

304
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,580
(LIAM) That could
be a V or an L.

305
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,740
It's a tick.

306
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,580
Or the start of a swastika.

307
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,140
It's probably the start of a
swastika, they were such pricks.

308
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,060
Did you have fun
with the old gang?

309
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,780
Yeah.

310
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,780
Speak to that Jonas much?

311
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,140
No, no, not really.

312
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,180
He's a bit of knob innit?
Bit of a dick?

313
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,900
Jonas.

314
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,740
Pulling himself off to his
own relationships theories.

315
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,980
Oh, it must be such a drag,
Jonas, putting it about.

316
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,300
And when he protected me
from those assholes.

317
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,340
"Hey, come on, guys,
it's really not cool to re-do

318
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,860
another man's appraisals dudes".

319
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,700
Then why invite him over?

320
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,460
I like him.

321
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,300
You wanted me to invite him.

322
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,700
I didn't say anything.

323
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,420
You were laughing at
everything he said!

324
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,340
You invited him!

325
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,940
It's obvious I didn't
want him to come.

326
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,580
(CLICK)

327
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,660
<i>(FFION) Wow, it's early, it's
early to call it a night.</i>

328
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,660
<i>(JONAS) Right, do you fancy
a quick one down the pub?</i>

329
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,140
<i>(LIAM) Oh, I've gotta get back,</i>

330
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,740
<i>rescue Jody from the
paedophile baby sitter!</i>

331
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,100
<i>Yeah.</i>

332
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,300
<i>But Jonas, why don't
you come back to ours</i>

333
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,780
<i>for a nightcap if you want?</i>

334
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,580
See.

335
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,260
It was obvious I didn't want him
to come, I was being polite.

336
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,220
To a moron.

337
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,860
If you really don't want him to
come, you can get rid of him.

338
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,340
Hey, hey.

339
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,060
(LIAM) Hey.

340
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,940
Well actually what time is it?

341
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,500
It's midnight.

342
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,500
Phew, shit, it's quite late!
Time's gone on.

343
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,580
- Yeah, time does that.
- Yeah.

344
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,460
What, 15 minutes?

345
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,020
Yeah.

346
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,500
But it, we've got the
baby sitter inside, so...

347
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,060
So is that new info?

348
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,340
No, it's just that, we, I
mean we thought, right, Fi?

349
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,260
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

350
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,020
Okay, now I get it.

351
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,900
No, it's just that actually
it turns out we're tired

352
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,620
and I guess we forgot, but now
we've remembered, so, sorry.

00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,260
Whatever you're
cueing up, stop it.

526
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,060
Sit down, please.

527
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,260
Do you see that?

528
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,220
<i>You know Jeff?</i>

529
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,060
<i>(LIAM) Yes.</i>

530
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,780
<i>(JONAS) Yeah, you remember
meeting Jeff 'cause he would</i>

531
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,940
<i>have shown you, I don't
know, a re-do of the</i>

532
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,300
<i>side of his fridge,
something like that.</i>

533
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,300
Spot the difference.

534
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,180
You're drunk.

535
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,020
I'm the difference.

536
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,260
He's the greatest guy in the
world, and then I arrive and...

537
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,100
you clam.

538
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,700
For clarity.

539
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,060
We're just talking!

540
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,780
But moments later
you're so stiff.

541
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,180
<i>I don't know, a re-do of
the side of his fridge...</i>

542
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,220
(LIAM) You don't know
how to stand around him.

543
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,220
Your gauges are all over
the place, hot and cold.

544
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,620
This is just stupid!

545
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,660
But you can't hide
it, not completely.

546
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,580
See how you look at him.

547
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,220
<i>The less the relationship means,</i>

548
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,220
<i>the more you spend
on the wedding.</i>

549
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,220
<i>I mean really, you start
obsessing over these tiny</i>

550
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,620
<i>little details, and the
thickness of the wedding</i>

551
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,340
<i>invitation paper.</i>

552
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,140
Now, how you look at me.

553
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,220
<i>Well I think it's an
interesting choice</i>

554
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,380
<i>going grainless</i>

555
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,660
<i>(LIAM) It's a brave choice.</i>

556
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,620
<i>I'm sorry but...</i>

557
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,980
Tell me you look at me
nice like you look at him.

558
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,420
You can't.

559
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,020
And how am I looking
at you now, Liam?

560
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,180
How long did you go
out with him for?

561
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,500
Does it matter?

562
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:32,180
<i>You know half the organic
memories you have are junk.</i>

563
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,740
<i>Just not trustworthy.</i>

564
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,140
<i>Well, when it comes
to little things.</i>

565
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,740
<i>And big ones.</i>

566
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,780
(LIAM) Is that Marrakech?

567
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,740
Does that look like Marrakech?

568
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,540
No.

569
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,580
It's not Marrakech.

570
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,420
So how long did you
go out with him for?

571
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,300
Alright, about six months.

572
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,700
So not a, not a week
or a month, six months?

573
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,860
The ever-inflating romance.

574
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,420
You're probably still
going out with him.

575
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,300
Why am I on trial here?

576
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,460
What's been going on?

577
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,220
Nothing has been going on!

578
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,820
It was...

579
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,780
Christ you know how
it is when you first get with

580
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,620
someone and then previous
boyfriends come up.

581
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,940
He was never a boyfriend,
it was always a weird week.

582
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,260
I down-played it,
I fudged it, it was...

583
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,740
You lied?

584
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,100
Not everything that
isn't true is a lie, Liam.

585
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,940
Hello?

586
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,620
Yeah, alright he was a
bigger thing than I made out,

587
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,700
and yeah he's sort of a dick.

588
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,540
Sort of? He's a massive...

589
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:43,540
But I, and I liked him then, and
I don't like him, not like that,

590
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,460
not now.

591
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,340
So just to get this clear.

592
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,260
He fucks you, gets footage
for his re-do wank file,

593
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,340
but you're still pally?

594
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,500
This is sad!

595
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,540
You know, 'cause if he was...

596
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,700
This is just sad.

597
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,420
... he probably sits there and tosses
himself off all over his cashmere blanket.

598
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,420
It was years ago!

599
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,980
Not for him.

00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,420
just sort this out.

something that you want?</i>

00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,740
Yeah I just wanna, I just
wanna come in and talk to you,

636
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,980
can you open the gate?

I just wanted to come in
for a bit, dude.

Look, Liam, this morning,
mate...

Oh, fucking hell.

Liam!

Jonas, this is a nice place.

Hey, seriously, man.

Look, it's not cool you
just walking in like this,

650
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,300
and to be honest with
you it's a little bit weird.

651

Is that a Marakeechian lamp?

652
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,220
Liam, do I have to call Fi?

653
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,540
Did you guys have a row
or something like that?

654
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,620
- Sit down.
- No, I'm alright.

655
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,100
Go on, sit down, it's not a
bear trap, it's your chair.

Do you want me to bounce
this off your fucking head?

I'm joking, Jonas!

00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,100
Bloody hell, I thought you
was supposed to be cool, man,

you're meant to
be fucking brilliant.

For goodness sake, you need
to grow a sense of humour.

He's uptight, ain't he?

671
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,300
(JONAS) Okay, Liam.

672
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,860
It's a lovely room this.

Or do you do it in that room?

676
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,100
Okay, Liam, I want
you to leave now.

677
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,100

and then finish in there?

720
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,420
Liam, what happened?

721
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,940
Did you use a condom or not?

722
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,900
Just say.

723
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,460
Yeah, well, whatever you think.

- Am I?

726
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,700
Yes, of course.

727
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,940
You sure about that?

728
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,700
Yes!

729
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,820
That's nice.

730
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,620

731
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,220
That's why I bought it for you.

732
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,620

Thought it was pretentious shit.

You know when you
suspect something?

743
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,340
It's always better when
it turns out to be true.

744
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,540
It's like I've had a
bad tooth for years and I'm

745
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,700
just finally getting my
tongue in there and I'm digging

746

out all the rotten shit.

747
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,140
That's not what it looks like.

748
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,420
Oh, did Jonas come round
to read you a story?

749
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,540
No, it was...

750
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,500
A story about fucking?

751
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,180
It was...

752
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,180
when all the Dan stuff
was going on,

753
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,500
and you'd walked out.

754
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,780
For like ten minutes.

755
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,580
For five days, Liam.

756
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,740
No call, no nothing.

757
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,180
So you fucked him
after four days?

758
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,820
That's heroic.

759
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,180
I mean three days, that's
admirable, but four days.

760
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,060
I mean you must
have been gagging.

761
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,420
I was upset.

762
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,900
We went for a
drink, I got drunk.

763
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,500
It shouldn't have happened.

764
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:22,100
I'm sorry.

765
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:26,340
I'm so sorry, I can't,
I can't say anything else.

766
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,420
I love you!

767
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,300
Did you use a condom?

768
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,860
Yes.

769
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,060
'Cause we didn't have any
here, we were trying.

770
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,260
He had some.

771
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,660
In his pocket?

772
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,580
In his car.

773
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,860
Was it his decision or
did you make him wear one?

774
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,780
I made him.

775
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,300
And you saw him put it on?

776
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,700
Yes.

777
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,460
Show me then.

778
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,700

780
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,060
I deleted it.

781
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,860
I wanted it to go away,
I wiped the whole thing.

782
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,060
Did you?

783
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,540
Yeah.

784
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,740
So it's just a blank
gap in your timeline?

785
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,860
Yeah.

786
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,260
Show me that then.

787
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,300
Yeah, okay.

788
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,660

789
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,260
No!
No deleting it, not now!
