And we are.

364
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,740

it was a singular you, i.e. me.

tracing the video's origin.

Technically yes,
but so I thought,

369
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,340
work with what we
do know, and that video?

370
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,700
Okay, before YouTube
compression it was 57.3 meg...

371
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,500
...algorithm, boring.

372
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,980
Anyway, we also know
it was uploaded at 3:16am,

373
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,820
so I ran a nationwide
trace back on uninterrupted

374
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,420
one way uploads at precisely
57.3 meg in the minutes

375
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,900
leading up to 3:16,

376
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,500

is a post code.

377
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,020

from somewhere in there.

378
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,700

(WALKER) She's back, ma'am.
We've got her, Susannah.

704
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,640
They released her?

705
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,960
Yeah, stumbling about in the
middle of the city, sedated,

706
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,240
she can't remember anything,
but she's unharmed.

707
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,520
But her finger?

708
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,640
Not hers, the
DNA shows it's male.

709
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,280
What?

710
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,840
There is one other thing
ma'am, there's a CCTV grab

711
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,200
of her from half three,
it seems he let her go

712

30 minutes before it happened.

Why?

714
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,040
My guess, he
knew everyone would be

716
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,760

Ma'am?
