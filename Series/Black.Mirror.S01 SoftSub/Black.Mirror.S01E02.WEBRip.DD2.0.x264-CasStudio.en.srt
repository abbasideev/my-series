380

on this one.

Good though your voice
is and it is good...

390
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,840
it's not the most magical sound
in the world.

391
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,680
It's just good.

392
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,640
I don't think anyone's
really hearing it.

393
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,320
Certainly not the
guys in the audience.

394
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,680
These looks you got going
on kinda get in the way.

395
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,000
Men will want you,
women will hate you.

396

All the time
you were on stage...

397
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,000
I couldn't help picturing you...

398
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,200
in an erotic scenario.

399
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,080
Getting pretty turned on,
if I'm honest.

400
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,600
Right.

401
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,200
You've got this pure beauty,

402
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,880
seems to be a knockout figure,

403
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,120
and this sort of
interesting innocence going on,

404
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,800
and that's something I think

405
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,280
Wraith's erotica channels
could really play with.

406
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,040
(JUDGE WRAITH) Absolutely.

407
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,960
That's what I thought the
moment I saw you. The moment.

408
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,560
I'd watch.

409
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,560
I don't know a man
here who wouldn't.

410
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,160
To be honest, some of
us girls might join you.

411

You will never have to pedal
again, not one minute!

419
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,080
We could really work with you.

420
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,000
Last year we had singers,
singers, singers.

421
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,560
So many singers.

422
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,880
So to be a singer you've
gotta be truly exceptional.

423
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,480
Yeah.

424
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,320
(JUDGE HOPE) There's
just no slots left for an

425
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,280
above-average singer, not for
the next few years at least.

426
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
Charity?

427
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,440
No. Saturation
point singer wise.

428
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,280
(JUDGE HOPE) Listen, we said
right from the start

429
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,840
we're gonna go with something
different this season.

Forget about all the
shame and all that...

435
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,160

We medicate against that.

it is that or the bike.

An entertainer.

that down the screen

I haven't got a speech!
I didn't plan words.

I... I just knew I had to

579
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,540
get here to stand here and I
knew I wanted you to listen.

580
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,860
To really listen, not just pull
a face like you're listening,

581

like you do the
rest of the time.

582
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,140
A face like you're feeling
instead of processing.

583

You pull a face and poke it

dance and tumble around.

And the faker the fodder
is the more you love it

only thing that works anymore!

589

Fake fodder is all

Actually not quite all.

591
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,900
Real pain, real viciousness,
that we can take.

592

Yeah, stick a fat man up a pole
and we'll laugh ourselves feral,

'Cause we're so out of our minds
with desperation, we don't know

596
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,740
any better! All we know
is fake fodder and buying shit!

597
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,860
That's how we speak to each
other, how we express ourself

598
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:33,460
is buying shit!
Well, I have a dream.

599
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:36,380
The peak of our dreams
is a new hat for our dopple;

600
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,100
a hat that doesn't exist;
that's not even there!

601
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,180
We buy shit that's
not even there! Show us

602
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,780
something real and free and
beautiful you couldn't, yeah?

603
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,260
It'd break us.
We're too numb for it.

604
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:49,020
I might as well choke.

605
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,980
There's only so much wonder we
can bear, that's why when you

606
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,660
find any wonder whatsoever you
dole it out in meagre portions,

607
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:56,420
and only then till it's
augmented and packaged and

608
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:59,620
pumped through 10,000
pre-assigned filters, till it's

609
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:02,340
nothing more than a
meaningless series of lights,

610
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:09,020
while we ride day-in day-out,
going where? Powering what?

611
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:11,980
All tiny cells and tiny screens,
and bigger cells and bigger

612
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,100

613
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:17,620
Fuck you, that's what it
boils down to is fuck you!

614
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:20,900
Fuck you for sitting there and
slowly making things worse.

615
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,860
Fuck you and your spotlight and
your sanctimonious faces, and

616
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,540
fuck you all for taking the
one thing I ever came close to

617
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:31,380
anything real about anything;
for oozing around it and

618
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,460
crushing it into a bone, into a
joke, one more ugly joke in a

619
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:41,540
kingdom of millions of them!
Fuck you for that happening!

620
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:44,620
Fuck you for me,
for us, for everyone!

621
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,500
Fuck you!

622
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:11,860
That was without a doubt...

623
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,460
the most heartfelt thing

624
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:17,900

You're so articulating someone

everyone in this hall,
something we all agree on.

630

Even though we may not
comprehend all of it,

631
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:42,980
I think I'm right in
saying we do feel it.

632
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,900

down as this creature.

636
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,700
It's not stuff it's...

637
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,620
It's truth. Am I right?

638
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:04,620
Your truth, admittedly,
but truth nonetheless.

639
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:10,380
And you're right, authenticity
is in woefully short supply.
