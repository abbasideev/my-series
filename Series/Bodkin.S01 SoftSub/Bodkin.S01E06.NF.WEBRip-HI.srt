00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,041
<i>In Ireland, they tell the story
of the fetch.</i>

<i>The fetch is
your supernatural doppelgänger,</i>

00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,291
<i>your twin.</i>

00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,666
<i>And if you happen to see yourself,</i>

8
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,500

00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,666
[in English] Guys, everyone back, please.

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,583
Move back.

15
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,166
- Back, back, back, back.
- [indistinct chattering]

16
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,500
- [man 1] Isn't that Seamus's boat?
- [man 2] I think so, yeah.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,625
Everyone, please. Will you get back?
You can't record that either.

18
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:03,748
- [man 1] Easy.
- Sergeant?

19
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,625
You have to move it along now, please.

20
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,500
Oh... what?

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,791
I thought ye were all "#vanlife."

22
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,041
Jesus, lads, you're good.

23
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:16,833
Oh yeah. Come on.

24
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:18,541
[Charles] Any bodies?

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Seamus?

26
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,083
We're sending divers in.

27
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,208
Well, no, but I...
I paid my pal Billy 20 euro

28
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,958
to go in and... and take a gander.

29
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:31,625
[chuckles] Yeah, 'tis not exactly
<i>CSI: Skibbereen</i> around here.

30
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:34,833
We've been tasked to work
with the local Gardaí for an extradition.

31
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:38,041
Since your superior's in the hospital,
we'll need your help in apprehending one

32
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,333
"Dubheasa Maloney."

33
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:41,791
[squeals]

34
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,708
Uh... [chuckles]

35
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,916
- Will I need a gun?
- No.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,750
- Well... maybe.
- No.

37
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,875
We just need you to arrest her.
This is your jurisdiction.

38
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,250
I'll be accompanying you.

39
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,583
I've got you now.

[softly] Two fuckin' years.

44
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,708
[Emmy] Do you think Seamus knows?

45
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,291
No. No way.

46
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,625
I mean, if he knew, he would...

47
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,791
- Yo, Emmy, do you have an iron?
- No.

48
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,083
Well, it seems like
the sort of boring thing you'd have.

49
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,708
[exhales] I don't have an iron, Dove.

50
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,291
Huh.

51
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,541
[sighs]

52
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:03,708
[grunts]

53
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:12,833
I've got sausages from Clon,
so thick they look like crubeens.

54
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,625
I've got cherry tomatoes from Ballydehob,

55
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,833
and I've got eggs
from my man at the English market.

56
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,166
Eggs. Eggs would be great.

57
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,083
Um. What I'd really like is some yogurt.

58
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,500
Yogurt?

59
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,041
Yeah. Or some fruit, maybe.

60
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,541
A banana, or...

61
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,750
[Edna sighs]

62
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Hmm.

63
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:45,666
You could've at least had a sausage.
You know, they're thick as crubeens.

64
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,458
You don't know what a crubeen is.

65
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,583
No, but, you know, that they're thick.

66
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,666
Psst.

67
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,625
[whispers] Wanna see something weird?

68
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,625
Some papers tied with a curtain tie?

69
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,708
No.

70
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,583
It's a fucking cincture.

71
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,666
A belt from a nun's habit.

72
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,791
It's just a bunch of old utility bills,
her nursing certificate.

73
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,208
I... I don't really understand.
What's the significance of the cincture?

74
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,666
Cinctures are unique to each order.
This one's from the Sisters of Mercy.

75
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,250
The same order as the nuns
on Inish Mac Tire.

76
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,666
Meaning?

77
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,250
Sisters of Mercy are a nursing order.
Mrs. O'Shea has already told us that...

78
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,541
What the hell are you doing?

79
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,750
- Why do you have a nun's cincture?
- None of your business.

80
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:32,958
[papers rustle]

81
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,625
My past is my own.

82
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,125
[Gilbert] Wait. You were a nun?

83
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,666
I told you that.

84
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,791
You sure didn't.

85
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,333
- You said you were a nurse.
- Yeah.

86
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,583
I was a nurse. I am a nurse.

87
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,875
- And a fuckin' nun.
- I've got a headache. Please.

88
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,291
Please, just... Oh.

89
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,958
- Very fucking convenient.
- Maybe reel it in a bit, Dove.

90
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,208
- Are you all right?
- She's fuckin' grand.

91
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,375
Aren't ya, Sister?

92
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,041
[foreboding music playing]

93
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,166
It's not a doll's house, Dubheasa.

94
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,000
This is my home.

95
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,916
You come here, tearing through our lives,

96
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:09,666
and for what?

97
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:15,541
Some pale, limp retelling of a story
that you will <i>never</i> understand.

98
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:22,166
Now... why don't the three of you fuck off
back to where you came from?

99
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,750
Okay, uh, maybe we all take a breath

100
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,333
and just sit down
around a nice plate of thick sausages...

101
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,833
[Edna] Breakfast is canceled!

102
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,208
[music fades out]

103
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,958
We know Fiona was pregnant.

104
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,500
Teddy, the boy she had a strong bond with,
killed Malachy, only to go missing,

105
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,503
and appeared three days later
with a head injury.

106
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,375
Found by a nun.

107
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,875
Yeah, Sister McDonagh,
who was babbling about boats, remember?

108
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,250
- Sister McDonagh, the nun.
- And Mrs. O'Shea.

109
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,333
Was a nun.

110
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,095
If the Sisters of Mercy
are a nursing order,

111
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,625
then O'Shea could've been a nurse
and a nun at the same time.

112
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,375
- She seems connected.
- There's literally an island of nuns.

113
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,375
Yeah, everything does seem like
it's pointing back to Inish Mac Tire.

114
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,726
Lads, In this country,
when a pregnant woman goes missing,

115
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,750
the nuns are the equivalent
of "the butler did it."

116
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,500
They're definitely hiding something.

117
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,416
- [Emmy] Hmm.
- And O'Shea's in on it.

118
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,208
I'll book three tickets
for the first ferry.

119
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,416
- Today?
- Oh, what? That doesn't work for you?

120
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,375
I'm meeting my wife.

121
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,583
She flew in.
I... I kind of have to see her today.

122
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,750
Are you joking?
We have a sonogram. We have a lead.

123
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,833
This is your podcast, Gilbert.

124
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,958
This is what's important.
You have all night to shag your wife.

125
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:32,333
I need to see her. All right? Talk to her.
And then I'll just follow you out.

126
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:36,083
- Maybe we should wait for you.
- Absolutely not. We leave immediately.

127
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:40,583
If you're worried about the timing issue,
with the... extradition...

128
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,833
What extradition?

129
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,958
You know what you are, Gilbert?

130
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,218
- You're a fucking buffoon.
- [chair scrapes]

131
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,500
A serious man would put his work first.

132
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,333
Be quick, Gilbert.
I can't take her on my own for long.

133
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,875
- [whimsical music playing]
- [Emmy sighs]

134

[Seamus huffs]

[suspenseful music playing]

138
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,083
[breathing heavily]

139
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,041
What the fuck happened to you?

140
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,500
Some cunt set fire to my boat,
with me in it.

141
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,250
Jesus Christ.

142
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,125
Here, have you seen
any strange fellas around town?

143
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,958
Huh? Northern accents?

144
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,375
- [Sean] No.
- [Seamus] Fuck.

145
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,208
Anyone comes asking for me,
you don't know me.

146
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,750
- Well, what's going on?
- Some old friends have found me.

147
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,833
[breathing heavily]

148
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,333
I have to leave town.

149
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,708
Leave? What, like <i>leave</i> leave?
Who's after you?

150
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,125
The fuckin' McArdles.

151
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,708
I've got some grab bags
hidden about the place.

152
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:13,416
I'll talk to Pablo and Hector.
Think I can get the deal back on track.

153
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,291
You, get them the eels tonight.

154
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,375
And then,

155
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,416
I'm gone.

156
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,000
What, so...

157
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,166
so, all this, I can just...
I can just have it?

158
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,208
Hey, did you cancel them Yakuza?

159
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,458
I was thinking about that, yeah.

160
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,381
Their offer's way better
than the Spanish lads.

161
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,767
- Why don't we ju...
- I don't need your fuckin' cost analysis.

162
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,083
Did you tell them to fuck off or not?

163
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,375
Yeah, yeah. I did, yeah.

164
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,125
Good.

165
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,083
[sighs, grunts]

166
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:42,875
[grunts] Fuck.

167
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,000
[grunting]

168
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,708
[water babbling]

169
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,166
We just need to slow them down.

170
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,166
Give us time to think.

171
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,750
I'll call you back.

172
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,500
I have orders here
to detain Dubheasa Maloney.

173
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,291
Top-secret orders, like,

349
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,166
I mean, our story, it helped people.

350
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,625
It didn't help me.

351
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,500
It exposed me.

352
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,458
I hired a forensic accountant. I know
that you're hemorrhaging money and...

353
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,916
But this podcast is gonna
put us back in the black.

354
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:17,291
For a man who spends his life listening,
there is a lot you just don't hear.

355
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:22,125
If I had to pinpoint exactly what it is
you like about podcasting,

356
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,750
I'd say it's recording
those fluffy intro ramblings

357
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,583
before every fucking episode,
where everything is still hypothetical,

358
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,541
still abstract, still <i>The Gilbert Show.</i>

359
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:34,875
Okay, well now you're making me
sound like a... buffoon.

360
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:38,291
- [jaunty music continues]
- [sighs] Things have changed, Gilbert.

361
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,375
We've changed.

362
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,833
You can't fix everything in the edit.

363
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,541
Please sign.

364
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,416
Please.

365
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,250
For me.

366
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,875
[pages rustle]

367
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:07,500
[Gilbert breathes deeply]

[music fades out]

369
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,041
I'll ask if anyone's seen Fiona,
slash Dominica.

370
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,375
[indistinct chattering]

371
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,291
[woman 1] Oh, great. Thank you, Sister.

372
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,750
That's perfect.

373
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,791

376
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,500
[Dove] Mam?

377
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,250
Hey.

378
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,583
Mam? Wait!

379
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,666
[unsettling music continues]

380
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:58,958
Hey, stop!

381
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,500
Mam?

382
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,166
Hey, wait!

383
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,583

387
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,625
- [woman 2] Breathe!
- [man] One, two, three.

388
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,041
[woman 3] Get her out of here!

[women chattering]

391
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,916
Apparently, Sister Dominica's
down at the convent's day spa,

392
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,458
which is a sentence
I never thought I'd say.

393
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,541
- Dove?
- Uh...

394
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,458
Yeah, um... Yeah, fine.

395
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Okay.

[intriguing music playing]

397
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,791
[nun] That's for you.

[Emmy] You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

401
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,916
[inhales deeply, exhales shakily]

402
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,708
They're just bodies, Emmy.

403
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,916
Lots and lots of human bodies.

404
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,208

Fuck you.

- [music fades out]
- Sister Dominica? You just missed her.

409
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,875
- She went back to the apiary.
- Oh my God. Thank you.

410
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,250
Dove?

411
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:04,750
Dove?

No!

418

No! Get... Stop!

419
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,041
Let go! Get off!

420
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:20,458
No!

421
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:21,916

- Fuck. Oh fuck, Emmy.

[breathing heavily]

436
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:07,375
It's the tea.

437
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,976
Sister Bernadette, she...
she put something in the tea.

438
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,250
- What?
- She fucking dosed me.

439
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,250
[softly] Emmy... I'm tripping.

440
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:16,375
Oh, come on, Dove. They're nuns.
They didn't dose you with psychedelics.

- Come on.

and story to...

Fuck.

- Oh, no, no, no, no. Wait up.
- Breathe.

448
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,416
- No, I ju... I... I... I need to rest.

Uh, yes. She was just here.

They've dosed Dove with mushrooms.
I think they're dosing everyone.

Don't drink the tea, Gilbert.

499
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,250
Slow down.
What are you talking about? Where are you?

500

00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:56,000
What is wrong with you?

526
00:27:56,083 --> 00:28:00,083
You selfish, stupid bitch.

527
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,333
[flames whoosh ferociously]

528
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:06,416
[music intensifies]

529
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:11,875
[softly] What?

530
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,833
[breathes heavily]

531
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:20,791
[in Irish] <i>We all live
in each other's shadows.</i>

532
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:24,291
[whispering voices echoing]

533
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:26,375
- [music ends abruptly]
- [bees buzzing]

534
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:29,938
[in English] Are you Sister Dominica?

535
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,500
Mm-hmm.

536
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:32,625
You're not Fiona?

537
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:35,250
Who's Fiona?

538
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,291
[softly] Great.

539
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:38,875
[sighs]

540
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
[birds chirping]

541
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:49,666
[water babbling]

542
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:52,625
[Teddy] Tell me what happened.
I know something happened.

543
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:54,416
[Maeve] Teddy, you need to calm down.

544
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:57,767
- [Teddy] I know you know something.
- [mysterious music playing]

545
00:28:57,791 --> 00:29:00,309
- [Maeve] I can't help you, Teddy.
- [Teddy] I remember your boat.

546
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:01,625
[Gilbert breathes heavily]

547
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,791
[Teddy] Why won't you just
tell me the truth, Maeve?

548
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:05,708
[button clacks]

549
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,458
I know something happened on this island.
I... I know you know something.

550
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:12,125
[breathes agitatedly] I don't.

551
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:13,833
[Gilbert] Liar.

552
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:20,708
I know you lied about being in Dublin
the night of Samhain.

553
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:25,208
And I know Fiona was pregnant.

554
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I, um...

555
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,416
I... I ran out of Dad's house

556
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,916
to find Fiona.

557
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,625
I... I saw you down on the pier.

558
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:43,791
Fiona asked me to sail her to Wales.

559
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,500
But you didn't get there, did you?

560
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:50,458
[birds chirping]

561
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:57,833
[Gilbert] How'd Teddy get hurt?

562
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:04,416
Maeve, how did Teddy get hurt?

563
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,958
We were loading up,
and he just came outta nowhere.

564
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:15,083
I thought you were Seamus
coming after Fiona. [inhales sharply]

565
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,291
I lamped you with an oar.

566
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:25,250
[Teddy breathes deeply]

567
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:28,625
So you brought him here,
because you knew there was a nurse.

568
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:31,041
Mrs. O'Shea.

569
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:34,666
- It was quicker than going to a hospital.
- And Fiona?

570
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:40,875
[Maeve sighs softly]

571
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,875
You were here when Teddy was young.

572
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:48,833
He was a golden boy.

573
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:52,125
Smart, outgoing,

574
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:54,666
could've done anything.

575
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:58,916
You destroyed that.

576
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:01,875
[breathes shakily]

577
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:03,791
It was an accident.

578
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,166
[Gilbert sighs]

579
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:11,125
What happened to Fiona?

580
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:15,333
[Gilbert] Tell us, Maeve.

581
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,541
Tell us what happened to Fiona.

582
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:23,875
[coughs]

583
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:25,208
[Emmy exhales] You okay?

584
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:27,041
Thanks.

585
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:28,833
[retches, vomits]

586
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:31,166
[Emmy scoffs]

587
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,000
- Sorry.
- [sighs]

588
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:36,416
[softly] God.

589
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:39,291
Well, that was a waste of time.

590
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,541
Were you high when you were talking
to Sister McDonagh?

591
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:42,833
[sniffs]

592
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:43,916
Yeah, I think so.

593
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,250
[breathes heavily]

594
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,083
She was an angel for a bit, and

595
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:50,458
there was a bee in her bed.

596
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,375
Eh, what exactly did she say?

597
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:54,208
Why did you think
Fiona lived on the island?

598
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:57,500
She said Fiona used to
watch over her... [retches]

599
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,791
[gulps]...while she tended the bees.

600
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,875
[vomits, coughing]

601
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,916
[sniffs]

602
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,125
[Emmy] Dove.

603
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:23,333
There's no name, no date. Just...

604
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:24,958
What's that word?

605
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,750
<i>Máthair.</i>

606
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:28,916
It means "mother."

607
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:31,750
[Teddy] I...

608
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:34,083
I don't understand.

609
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:37,500
We sent you home.

610
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,791
But Fiona was worried
she'd missed her opportunity.

611
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,791
Seamus was in town and on the warpath,
looking everywhere for her and Malachy.

612
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,000
She stayed here.

613
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:48,333
She was safe.

614
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:52,500
And with Edna taking care of her
and me running supplies,

615
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:55,625
she had everything she needed
to deliver the baby.

616
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:57,583
[Bernadette] What is going on here?

617
00:32:58,208 --> 00:32:59,458
What are you doing?

618
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:02,791
This is a most egregious transgression.

619
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,625
You have no right to come in here...

620
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:07,208
Maeve.

621
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:10,250
What happened to her?

622
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,333
Not a word

623
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:13,291
to anyone about this.

624
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:15,750
You must promise.

625
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:19,875
- [button clacks]
- [mysterious music playing]

626
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,250
[Bernadette] She was early.

627
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,000
We were prepared, but

628
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,750
she died.

629
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:27,916
She and the baby both.

630
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,541
31st of May, the Feast of the Visitation.

631
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:37,083
The day Our Lady went
to visit her cousin, Elizabeth,

632
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:38,750
who was also pregnant.

633
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:44,125
You don't get too many stories
in the gospels about just women.

634
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:49,958
It is one of the most joyous feast days
in our calendar.

635
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:53,375
- [Dove grunts]
- [Bernadette gasps]

636
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:55,125
Oh. Dove! Dove!

637
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:56,333
Shit. Dove!

638
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:58,833
[Seamus] Sean's a fuckwit,
I know, but you know,

639
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:00,666
he's harmless.

640
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:02,708
I'm sure he'll be here any minute now.

641
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:03,958
[tense music playing]

642
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,333
[Hector grumbling]

643
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:09,500
What the fuck is that?

644
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,208
- [hollow metal clangs]
- [Hector] Where's my eels?

645
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:15,416
[hollow metal clanging]

646
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:19,083
[tense music intensifies]

647
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,750
Fuckin' Sean.

648
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:24,791
[breathes irately]

649
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,250
I'll fuckin' kill him.

650
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,541
He's a dead man!

651
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:33,125
Fucking dead man!

652
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:37,958
- [kettle whistling]
- [music fading out]

653
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:42,416
I was just smoking in the chapel.
I didn't mean to burn the fucker down.

654
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,541
- [whistling subsiding]
- [water bubbling]

655
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,583
But I also wasn't sorry about it.

656
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:51,708
I can't absolve you, you know.

657
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,666
- My mother was an addict.
- [water pouring]

658
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,125
[Bernadette] She was ill.

659
00:34:58,416 --> 00:35:00,125
She left me at a convent.

660
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,500
[Bernadette] There are worse places.

661
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:04,291
And then she got clean.

662
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:07,041
Such a stupid expression.

663
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,500
[Dove] I saw her once... after.

664
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:14,166
She came back to the convent. She...

665
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:17,291
She didn't even wanna see me.

666
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:20,250
[inhales shakily]

667
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:21,708
I thought she hated me.

668
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,291
Maybe she hated herself.

669
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:31,041
Maybe she was a woman of limited choices.

670
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:33,041
Or maybe she was...

671
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:34,458
Kind of an arsehole.

672
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:42,250
You can only ask forgiveness
for yourself, Dove.

673
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:46,041
Maybe she loved you, maybe she didn't.

674
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,875
Which story do you want to tell?

675
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,090
[voice breaks] The one
where I was good enough.

676
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:58,458
[footsteps approaching]

677
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,458
Personally, I've always preferred
confessing face-to-face.

678
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:12,541
And what would a Mother Superior
have to confess?

679
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:13,666
[chuckling] Oh.

680
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:19,166
Oh, Dove, the way it all played out,
it lies heavy on my immortal soul.

681
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:24,833
I buried a woman here on my island

682
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,166
and demanded silence from my flock.

683
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,166
Hardly the actions
of the pure and the chaste.

684
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,000
But I, too, had responsibilities
to a story.

685
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:36,333
[clicks tongue] I'll be honest,

686
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:39,916
I thought you were gonna
ask forgiveness for fucking dosing me.

687
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,875
[Bernadette] Ha!

688
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:43,083
- And your poor penitents.
- [chuckles]

689
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:46,041
They come here searching for revelation.

690
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:48,583
And we deliver.

691
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:52,000
I have to believe
that the ends justify the means,

692
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:56,500
and I'd assume
that you're of like mind in that regard.

693
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:57,708
[knocking on door]

694
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,541
Ah. I'll leave you to catch up.

695
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,833
- [door closes]
- Something's up.

696
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:12,125
Bernadette just said she buried Fiona.

697
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:15,208
Only Fiona.
And the grave just says "mother."

698
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:18,250
The Catholics have pretty famous ideas
on babies in wombs.

699
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:20,291
I googled the Feast of Visitation,
and it said...

700
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:22,541
The dates don't match up
with the sonogram.

701
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:24,458
- Bernadette's lying.
- [Dove sighs]

703
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:29,000
Dubheasa Maloney,
I'm placing you under arrest.

704
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,166
I'll ask you now to come with me.

705
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,583
Fuckin' nuns.

706
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,625
- [footsteps approaching]
- [handcuffs clatter]

707
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,416
- [dramatic music plays]
- Go, Dove! Run!

708
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,583
Run!

709
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:43,083
Ow! God!

710
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:44,833
Ah! Oh!

711
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,250
- [screams] Ah!
- What the...

712
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:47,625
- [music fades out]
- Ah!

713
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:48,708
Oh!

714
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:50,541
Fuck!

715
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:53,000
- Ends justify means?
- [Gilbert screams] Ah!

716
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:56,083
- Something like that.
- [Gilbert whimpering] Oh God! Oh fuck!

717
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:58,083
[handcuffs clacking]

718
00:37:58,166 --> 00:37:59,708
Oh my God!

719
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:03,666
- [Gilbert cries out]
- [Eoin] Told you I needed a gun.

720
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,375
- [Gilbert cries out, groans]
- [Charles] We'll be back for him.

721
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:07,708
[coughs, whimpering]

722
00:38:07,791 --> 00:38:08,791
Fuck.

723
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:20,291
Ah. Come on, loveen.

724
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:23,458
They're waiting to take you
back to the mainland.

725
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:27,375
And you don't want
to keep the Gardaí idling.

726
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31,666
[smacks lips] 1997.

727

1999.

729
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:39,541
Huh. [chuckles]

730
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:41,250
Mrs. O'Shea isn't in this one.

731
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:43,375
The year she left.

732
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:47,250
That was a traumatic year.

733
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:51,250
A mother and her unborn child dying.

734
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:53,750
Only the child didn't die, did he?

735
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:57,750
Do you think I'm an idiot?

736
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:02,041
Mrs. O'Shea didn't leave the order
and adopt a Romanian child.

737
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:05,625
- [intriguing music plays]
- She left with Fiona's healthy baby.

738
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:06,708
Sean.

739
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:09,958
Sean is Fiona and Seamus's child.

740
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,958
[exhales shakily]

741
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:15,958
Jesus. [breath trembles]

742
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:19,250
Would you people ever just fuck off?

743
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,916
[inhales deeply, huffs irately]

744

746
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,791
It's grand, okay?

747
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:31,875
Everything's grand, I promise.

748
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:33,333
Do the hand-over tomorrow.

749
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:35,041
Shouldn't be a problem.

750
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:39,250
But just to clarify... Seamus will be there?

751
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:41,041
Things have changed.

752
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:42,666
[exhales] I'm the man now.

763
