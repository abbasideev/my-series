[Damien] I am your editor,
and I'm telling you,

48
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,208
there is no way
you're coming into the office.

49
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,833
I've been staring at my bedroom wall
for two days. I'm not running away.

50
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,208
And I'm supposed to be
in a meeting right now

51
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,250
explaining this shit show to the board.

52
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,375
Tell them the truth. I've nothing to hide.

53
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,208
- I'm trying to protect you.
- I don't need protecting.

54
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,250
You need to get out of town.

55
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:02,958
No.

56
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,625
- No, I've done nothing wrong.
- [Damien] Okay.

57
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,333
I have to put you
on something else, temporarily.

58
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,333
Ireland?

59
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,416
No way.

60
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,916
Why the fuck would I go back there?

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,208
- Have you heard of Gilbert Power?
- Who?

62
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,666
- He's a podcaster we're working with.
- Oh Christ, Damien.

63
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,791
We need you out of sight.

64
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,916
And he needs someone
who knows the lay of the land.

65
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,041
No way.
No, I haven't been back in fuckin' years.

66
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,041
He's won a Peabody Award.
He's a big deal, okay?

67
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,916
We're partnering with him
on a true crime series.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,500
True crime podcasts aren't journalism.
They're necrophilia.

69
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,041
True crime is big business for us.

70
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,625
I'm an investigative journalist.

71
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,500
I will work on a true crime podcast
over my dead body.

72
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,708
Yeah. Yeah, good idea, Dove.

73
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,541
That's exactly what we need, another body.

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,708
[Gilbert] <i>Bodies?
I'm not interested in bodies.</i>

75
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,583
I'm about empathy.

76
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,541
And people talk about
true crime being sensationalist.

77
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,333
But you know what's really sensational?

78
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:11,416
Just listening to people tell their story.
There's nothing more interesting.

79
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,583
- Yeah. Totally.
- [Gilbert] Right?

80
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,125
The best stories are always mysteries.

81
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,833
And there's only one true mystery.

82
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,416
The human heart.

83
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,375
Wow.

84
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,125
People will listen to that, will they?

85
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,166
Wait, Dove? Are you Dove?

86
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,375
Oh my God. It's so nice to meet you.

87
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,375
But, uh, so Damien was telling me
all about you.

88
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,750
L-Like what?

89
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,958
Uh... Good stuff.

90
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,125
Yeah, good stuff.

91
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,625
Um, do you know our researcher Emmy?

92
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,708
I'm Emmy Sizergh.
I work in the digital department.

93
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,625
[chuckles] We've actually met
a couple of times.

94
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,708
No, I don't think so.

95
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:50,708
Oh.

96
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,041
- [Gilbert chuckles awkwardly]
- Um, so I've organized everything.

97
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,166
Accommodation is sorted,
interviews lined up. I've got maps.

98
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,041
I've hired a driver for the week.
"Sean O'Shea."

99
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,083
[chuckles] How Irish is that?

100
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,806
I've actually been trying to learn Irish,

101
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,791
which is a really difficult, um...
difficult... difficult language.

102
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,416
[Gilbert] Hey. Hey.

103
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,333
This is gonna be so much fun.

104
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,208
- Look at us. The dream team.
- [Emmy chuckles]

105
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,833
Bodkin has no idea what's about to hit it.

106
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,541
- [Emmy] Hmm.
- [Dove sighs]

[music fades out]

110
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,083
[Gilbert, in English]
I'm just so excited to be here.

111
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:19,708
I mean, look at this green.
It's <i>so</i> green. I love it.

112
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,041
It's, like, exactly the green I imagined.
You know?

113
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,250
Um, so I've prepared a quick itinerary.

114
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,892
We'll drop our bags at the guest house,

115
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,556
then go to Ailbhe's Hollow,
where the "Sam-hain" Festival was held.

116
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,583
- Then I found a nice pub for dinner.
- "Sow-in."

117
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,250
- Uh, excuse me?
- Uh, "sow-in."

118
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,083
It's... it's pronounced "sow-in."

119
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,458
[Emmy] Oh. Sorry.

120
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,041
"Sow-in."

121
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,041
[softly] "Sow-in."

122
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,041
[mouths] "Sow-in."

123
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,083
So, ye lads here
for the festival next week?

124
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,958
No. But... [splutters] But, yes.

125
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,500
We're here to investigate
the Samhain mystery.

126
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,083
That old thing?

127
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,250
Jaysus. l wasn't even born
when that happened.

128
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,333
Oh, but it's so fascinating.

129
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,166
I mean, a small town mystery,

130
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,583
unsolved for 25 years.

131
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,375
Three unconnected people go missing
on the Irish Night of the Dead.

132
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,208
And now the town is reviving
the Samhain Festival?

133
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,666
I mean, it's a great story lens
for a podcast.

134
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,291
Right, yeah. And... and people
will listen to that, they will?

135
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,041
[Gilbert] Oh, people love true crime.

136
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,208
They love small towns,
and they love Ireland.

137
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,041
It's a four-quadrant story.

138
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,333
And, eh, in the podcast,
will you... will you mention me?

139
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,166
Yeah, maybe.
If you're part of the story. [chuckles]

140
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,875
Savage! [chuckles]

141
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
And, eh,

142
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,583
where are you from, then?

143
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:31,666
London.

144
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,833
No, no, no. I mean, uh...
I mean, where are you from originally?

145
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,458
You sound like a Dubliner. Are you a Dub?

146
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,291
Sure.

147
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,375
I'm, eh... I'm from Romania meself.

149
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,833
[Gilbert] Oh my God.

150
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,500
[chuckling] Oh my God!

151
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,958
Can you believe this?

152
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,500
Oh, wow.

153
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,500
You know, I've always thought that Ireland

154
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,125
was the most beautiful country
in the world.

155
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,708
Smile. You're on video.

156
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:14,958
Oh, this is perfect.

157
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,416
I mean, the air is so clean.

158
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,000
It just feels so nourishing.

159
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,583
[Sean] Ah, nice. Nice.
And you're all working together now?

160
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,708
[Emmy] Oh, yeah.
Dove and I work for <i>The Guardian.</i>

161
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,833
We're teaming up with Gilbert
for the podcast.

162
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,208
He's the producer.
I'm just the researcher.

163
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,333
You do this sort of thing often, do you?

164
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,083
Actually, it's my first time
out in the field. [chuckles]

165
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,666
It's, like, so exciting.

166
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,750
"Exciting"?

167
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,041
Wouldn't be the word I'd use.

168
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:46,625
[exhales] But, you know,
I'm sure we could work something out.

169
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,208
Yeah.

170
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,958
Hey, Sean, who's that?

171
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,375
[Sean] Oh, Shitpants?

172
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,291
Uh, I'm sorry. "Shitpants"?

173
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,583
[chuckles] No.

174
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,708
- That's just what people call him.
- Oh.

175
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,708
He went off to Silicon Valley,
came back with a load of cash.

176
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,291
- [Gilbert] Oh.
- That's his server farm there.

177
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,541
- [Gilbert] A server farm?
- Yeah.

178
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,666
Ireland's the tech capital
of Europe, you know?

179
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,458
- Oh. That's amazing.
- Yeah.

180
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,625
Uh, but w-w-wait.

181
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:15,208
But that... There's still, like,
small, quaint stuff here too, right?

182
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,375
[chuckles]

183
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,218
Whatever you want, boss,
I'll get it for you.

184
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,291
Okay, good.

185
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,375
[man] Sound.

186
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,375
[girl] Nice sunglasses.

187
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,458
Fuck off.

188
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,625
Dove, did you just tell that girl
to fuck off?

189
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,791
Yeah, you should try it sometime, Gilbert.

190
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:34,958
It's very nourishing.

191
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,833
[whimsical music plays]

192
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,541
[engine starts, revs]

193
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,250
[music continues]

194
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,000
Sean! Sean!

195
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,208
- Barry.
- Sean.

196
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,458
Cathal.

197
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,000
- Who's your friends?
- Ye lads on your holidays?

198
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,875
Oh, no, we're here for work.
We're, uh, making a podcast.

199
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,375
- A podcast?
- In Bodkin?

200
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,750
- Mm-hmm.
- [Barry chuckles]

201
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,916
And you do that for a job,
making podcasts?

202
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,166
[Gilbert] Sure.

203
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,291
And you've come from America
to do a podcast in Bodkin.

204
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,795
- And people will listen to it?
- [Gilbert] Yeah.

205
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,125
Some show about the lads
that went missing in Samhain.

206
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,416
About that auld thing?

207
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,333
Oh. Did you live here when it happened?

208
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh, yes.

209
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,375
But, you know...
it could have been anything.

210
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,916
They were probably caught by a rogue wave.

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,333
A... a rogue wave?

212
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,166
[Barry] My aunt got caught by one.

213
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,458
- Came up to her neck.
- Hmm.

214
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,916
And of course, if they were messing
with the stones up in the Hollow...

215
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,041
The stones?

216
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,625
Are you touched?

217
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,125
Stones?

218
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,500
Fairies, Gilbert.

219
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,916
- [engine starts]
- He's talking about fuckin' fairies.

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,083
- Listen, lads, be well, yeah?
- [Gilbert chuckles]

221
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,767
- Huh.
- Stay out of trouble, Barry, yeah?

222
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,151
[Barry] Hope it keeps fine for ye.

223
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,208
[Gilbert] Yeah, hope it keeps fine
for you too.

224
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,375
[gulls squawking]

225
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,041
- [doorbell chimes]
- [muffled chatter on car stereo]

226
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:24,851
- Hello.
- [Gilbert] Hello.

227
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,708
Hi, Mrs. O'Shea. I'm Emmy Sizergh.

228
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,000
I called you earlier.
We're staying with you this week.

229
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,125
[Mrs. O'Shea] Right.

230
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,708
Okay. Come on. In you come.

231
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,291
So, you're from America, then?

232
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,791
Chicago originally.

233
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,708
Oh, Chicago.

234
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,583
I had a couple here from Chicago
a few years ago.

235
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,041
What was their name?

236
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,125
Roger.

237
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,833
He was Roger, yeah.

238
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,916
And...

239
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,750
I want to say Beth.

240
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:51,833
Roger and Beth.

241
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,416
Do you know them?

242
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,416
I... I don't, uh, think so. Yeah. Hmm.

243
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,666
[Mrs. O'Shea] Well,
Chicago, I believe it's lovely.

244
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,958
Apart from all the crime, obviously.

245
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,666
[Gilbert] Well, yeah. Sure. Mm-hmm.

246
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,375
[Mrs. O'Shea] You know,
we get four seasons in one day here.

247
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,125
Four seasons in one day?

248
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,458
I love it.

249
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,458
- Have you got a good coat?
- Well, I have this one.

250
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,250
Yeah, but do you have a good one?

251
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,958
Now, I'm sure you'll be wanting...

252
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,401
- [Dove] Jaysus.
- ...a cup of tea.

253
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,083
I just made a pot.

254
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,250
[Emmy] We actually can't hang about, so...

255
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,041
[Mrs. O'Shea] Sure, but have a cup of tea.

256
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,125
[eerie music plays]

257
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,809
[Mrs. O'Shea] I know for a fact
you can't get decent tea in America.

258
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,125
- [soundscape fades out]
- [eerie music continues]

259
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
[music ends]

260
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,166
Do you own a dog, Mrs. O'Shea?

261
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,708
[Mrs. O'Shea] A dog? No.

262
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,541
Now, about that tea. [sighs]

263
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:49,000
I have to warn you,
we don't put cream in our beverages here.

264
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,875
- [mugs clink]
- Cream is a treat.

265
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,625
I know what you Americans are like,
with your cholesterol.

266
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,875
I used to be a nurse, you know.

267
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,800
Would you like me
to take your blood pressure?

268
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,416
Oh, uh, I think I'm good.

269
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,708
[chuckles softly]

270
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,791
Gilbert, we need to dash if we're gonna
make it to Ailbhe's Hollow on time.

271
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,208
Ailbhe's Hollow?

272
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,708
Yeah, we're making a podcast

273
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,625
about the people
who disappeared at Samhain.

274
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,458
A podcast? And will people listen to it?

275
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,791
Yes. Why does everybody ask that?

276
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,125
- [tea overflowing]
- Oh, Mrs. O'Shea?

277
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,500
Ugh. Love.

278
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,083
- [teapot clatters]
- Would you look at that?

279
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,500
I'd lose my own head
if it wasn't screwed on.

280
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,041
Are you okay, Mrs. O'Shea?

281
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,333
[intriguing music plays]

282
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:33,916
[Emmy] Mrs. O'Shea?

283
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,041
We should go.

284
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,000
[bass-heavy music playing on car stereo]

285
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,125
So this is Ailbhe's Hollow.

286
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,083
These stones are very atmospheric.

287
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,416
- You can feel how old it is.
- Um...

288
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,291
So, uh, every year, on October 31st,

289
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,666
the town would gather here
for the Samhain Festival.

290
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,958
But it was that night,
25 years ago, after the festivities ended,

291
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,541
they discovered
that three people had disappeared.

292
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,708
- So cool.
- [Emmy] Hmm.

293
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:10,791
[Gilbert] So cool.

294
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:12,958
- [Gilbert] Hi.
- [Emmy] Hi.

295
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,791
- How are ye? I'm Darragh.
- [Emmy] Oh. We spoke on the phone.

296
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,142
- I'm Emmy.
- Lovely to meet you.

297
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,208
- Hi. Gilbert.
- Darragh owns all this land.

298
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,666
Yeah. Take your time
and have a look around there.

299
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,041
But don't stray too far.

300
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,845
I've a melancholy bullock
in the next field.

301
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:29,125
[chuckles] So right here is where the town
used to have the Samhain Festival?

302
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,875
[Darragh] Yeah, every year,
the whole town would march up.

303
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,041
It'd be a big party.

304
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,833
To be honest, these days,
it's mostly used for a sneaky ride.

305
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,208
[chuckles] So it gets plenty of use.

306
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,416
So, people ride horses here?

307
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:42,708
[laughs]

308
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,125
A handsome fellow like you
will work it out quick enough.

309
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,500
I'll leave you to it. [chuckles]

310
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,916
[softly] "Ride" means sex.

311
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Oh.

312
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,791
- Yeah.
- [Emmy] Hmm.

313
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,208
[Damien] <i>How's it going with Gilbert?
Everyone says he's a genius.</i>

314
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,250
He thinks Ireland
is some kind of Disneyland.

315
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,250
[Damien] <i>Why not take a leaf
out of his book, treat it like a holiday?</i>

316
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,013
<i>You'll have a great time
with him and Emmy.</i>

317
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,291
Eh, have you met them?

318
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:11,625
They're very... upbeat.
It's like they're in a cult.

319
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,083
[Damien] <i>Podcasters are journalists,
same as you.</i>

320
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,583
[in dramatic voice]
Long before trick-or-treating,

321
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,916
before the costumes, before horror films,

322
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,541
Halloween had another name.

323
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,083
"Samhain."

324
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,500
[exhales] So cool.

325
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,833
[Dove] I have a real story back home,
an important one.

326
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,166
I've got no clue how to make a podcast.
What the hell am I doing here?

327
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,208
[Damien] <i>You're protecting your career</i>

328
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,416
<i>and the paper.</i>

329
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,000
<i>We need to be careful.</i>

330
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,791
I've got to go, Damien.
I'm off to enjoy my incredible holiday.

331
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,475
[lively traditional Irish music playing]

332
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,833
So the missing woman is Fiona Doyle.
She was a schoolteacher.

333
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,166
[Gilbert] Okay.
Uh, does she have any family in town?

334
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,791
Her parents are deceased,
no siblings I can find.

335
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:55,250
- But she does have a cousin here. Bridgit.
- Oh, great. We'll start there.

336
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,625
Now, the man who disappeared
is a different story.

337
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:01,000
His name was Malachy O'Connor,
but I can't find much more info than that.

338
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,583
And the boy, there's literally
no information about him.

339
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,916
I can't even find his name.
It's like he never even existed.

340
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,125
[Gilbert] Oh my God.

341
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,168
- [whispers] Over there. Over there.
- [Emmy] Hmm?

342
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,833
[Gilbert whispers] There's a nun.
A nun in a pub.

343
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,416
[chuckles]

344
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,934
- Love this country.
- [Emmy chuckles]

345
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,125
[Gilbert] Okay, anyway.

346
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,291
[soundscape muffles] So what I'm hoping
will really elevate this podcast

347
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,625
is the whole
mystical Samhain angle, right?

348
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,291
It's <i>very</i> atmospheric.

349
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,375
And I wanna try to find,
like, you know, lots of...

350
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,625
lots of Irish folk stories
and myths, you know?

351
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:33,125
And we should definitely try and find
more people talking about fairies.

352
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,500
Jesus. Gilbert, it's not literal.

353
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,875
No one actually believes there are tricksy
little people around causing mischief.

354
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:44,166
It's just... a way of not thinking about
the things you don't wanna think about.

355
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,416
Three people disappeared, Gilbert.

356
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,700
If you wanna get to the truth,

357
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,958
I wouldn't waste your time
in a tourist trap of a pub like this.

358
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,958
We need to find the real Bodkin.

359
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,833
[traditional music continues]

360
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,166
Sean, let's go.

361
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,166
[Sean] Right, boys.
Pleasure doing business as always, yeah?

362
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,833
[urine trickling]

363
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,958
- [man sighs]
- [muffled rock music playing]

364
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,416
- [rock music plays loudly]
- [indistinct chatter]

365
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,250
Better.

366
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,083
What can I get you?

367
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,166
Three Guinness.

368
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,458
Hi there.

369
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,500
This is a proper
old man's boozer. [chuckles]

370
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,333
It's a traditional pub.

371
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,666
It's lovely.

372
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,791
[man 1] We took the plunge,
dropped everything.

373
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,708
Quit our jobs, bought a van.

374
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,471
We were planning on driving across Europe,

375
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,666
but we can't quite bring ourselves
to leave West Cork.

376
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,833
- We love it here.
- Well, what's not to love?

377
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:54,750
[chuckles]

378
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,333
So, this podcast,

379
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,291
are you doing that thing
where you say it's about one thing,

380
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,375
but it's actually about something else?

381
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,017
- [smacks lips]
- [man 1] Easy, darling.

382
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,208
- What?
- No, no, no, she's right.

383
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,666
Uh, it's a convention,
but it's not my thing.

384
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,150
[woman] How are you gonna solve it?

385
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,208
[Gilbert] It's not really
about solving it.

386
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,500
It just has all the elements
of an amazing story.

387
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:18,375
Podcasting is very competitive,
and true crime really pops the market.

388
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,500
And it doesn't hurt
to be in such a beautiful place.

389
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,926
Gilbert, Bodkin might have
a nice waterfront,

390
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:28,000
but I guarantee you, bad things
happen here just like everywhere else.

391
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,416
[stool scrapes, clatters noisily]

392
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,000
- [chatter fades out]
- [music stops]

393
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:39,875
[sighs softly]

394
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:45,208
[sings solemn lyrics in Irish]

395
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,958
[in English] <i>â™ª When you're far away â™ª</i>

396
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:56,541

400

00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:39,000
<i>â™ª That is never olden â™ª</i>

406
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,666
- [fire crackling]
- [sparse clapping]

407
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,625
- [man 2] Jaysus.
- [woman] Oh, that was good.

408
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:43,708
[knocking]

409
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,166
[man 3] Good man, Teddy.

410
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,458
[rock music resumes]

411
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,166
Oh my God.

412
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,166
Yeah, just so you know, that's not normal.

413
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,036
Right, we're not all singing

414
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,791
and doing fuckin' <i>Riverdance</i>
all the time, yeah?

415
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,750
Fuck this.

416
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,875
Hey. Excuse me.

417
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,333
Hey.

418
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,250
That was, uh, amazing.

419
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,833
[sighs deeply]

420
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,708
Don't mind Teddy. He's gone back to sea.

421
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,625
I'm after hearin'
we've an American podcaster in town.

422
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:21,958
[chuckles] Yes, sir.

423
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,750
But actually, I'm Irish.
Yeah. Gilbert Power.

424
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,958
Uh-huh. Seamus Gallagher.

425
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,833
- Ah, you're Irish, are ya?
- Mm-hmm.

426
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,208
You don't say.

427
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,208
I do say.

428
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,958
Yeah, my great-grandfather
was Michael Power, from Cork.

429
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,750
Michael Power?

430
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,000
[Gilbert] Um, yes, sir.

431
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,375
- From Cork, you say?
- Yeah.

432
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,125
Well, now,

433
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,750
that would make us mortal enemies.

434
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:50,291
- What?
- Your great-grandfather was a thief.

435
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,708
And he stole five acres of land
from my great-grandfather.

436
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,059
Now I'm gonna have to ask you to leave
before things get ugly.

437
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,083
Uh...

438
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,416
[spluttering] Okay, um...

439
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
First of all, I'm sorry. I didn't...

440
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,375
- [mimics spluttering]
- I mean, that was generations before...

441
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,291
[laughs] I'm only messin' with ya.

442
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,291
- [Gilbert sighs]
- Gilbert Power. [chuckles]

443
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,416
Come on, now. I'm buying you a drink.

444
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,916
- I'll introduce you to the lads.
- Oh my God.

445
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,541
Do you think I could get him
to sign a release form?

446
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,416
No?

447
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:21,958
Okay.

448
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,416
[Dove sighs]

449
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,416
Spare a smokie?

450
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,250
I quit.

451
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,166
[grumbles] Too bad.

452
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,333
[muffled rock music continues]

453
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,666
I hear you're interested in the lads
that went missing on Samhain.

454
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,041
I know what happened to them.

455
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,041
Oh yeah?

456
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,166
But I shouldn't really say.

457
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,583
They were attacked.

458
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,250
Attacked?

459
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,541
By horses.

460
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,708
- [sighs]
- You should never trust a horse.

461
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,916
I once saw a horse run
seven times around a field,

462
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,500
and then it turned into a woman.

463
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:07,583
Right.

464
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,625
She was the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

465
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Horses,

466
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,791
they'll only break your heart.

467
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,041
[Dove, under breath] Fucking hell.

468
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,333
[Gilbert] Ah! Get in here!
Come on! Get in here!

469
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:26,416
Whoo!

470
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,041
[all laughing]

471
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,000
Ah!

[indistinct shouting]

473
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,958
I know! I'm trying! I'm trying!

474
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,958
Wait, why is nobody else drinking?

475
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,041

There's a reason
I left this fuckin' country.

480
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:55,625
Who gives a flying fuck
what happened here 20 years ago?

481
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,291
There's only one mystery in Bodkin.
It's why anyone would fuckin' stay.

482

- [Emmy sighs]

515
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:35,226
[Sean, on voicemail] <i>It's your boy, Sean.
Actually, it's your boy Sean's phone.</i>

516
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,750
<i>- So leave me...</i>
- [sighs]

517
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:38,458
Hey.

518
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:39,916
[hoarsely] Hey.

519
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:42,708
[exhales wearily]

520
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:47,833
- [sighs softly]
- You don't look so good, Gilbert.

521
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:50,958
I ju... just need some Tylenol and coffee
and I'll be fine.

522
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,291
Have you seen Dove?

523
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:53,916
- Mm-mm.
- [footsteps approaching]

524
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,916
- Oh. Thank you.
- [Mrs. O'Shea] Now.

525
00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,166
[softly] Hey.

526
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,791
I suppose you'll be wanting
some breakfast.

527
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,625
[softly] Please. Thank you.

528
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:06,791
[sighs deeply]

529
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:15,875
[Emmy] Gilbert?

530
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:17,541
- Hmm?
- I can't get through to Sean.

531
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:20,041
It's annoying. His car is outside,
but he's not picking up.

532
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:23,125
- Tylenol, coffee, Sean.
- [footsteps approaching]

533
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,000
- [sighs]
- [Emmy grumbles]

534
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:27,125
- [cheerily] Morning!
- [jacket thuds]

535
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:30,500
Uh. Um, out of curiosity, do you drive?

536
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,250
- What?
- [Emmy] Do you drive?

537
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:33,333
No.

538
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:35,541
Okay. Cool.

539
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:36,833
Where's Sean?

540
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:38,000
He's gone AWOL.

541
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:39,333
[blows]

542
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:40,666
What's the deal with Sean?

543
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,166
- Deal?
- Yeah, where'd you find him?

544
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,833
Online. I think he just does odd jobs
and taxis people around.

545
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:48,458
- [line clicks]
- [Sean, on voicemail] <i>It's your boy, Sean.</i>

546
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:50,517
<i>- Actually, it's your boy Sean's phone...</i>
- [sighs]

547
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:52,333
Okay, so, guys, we've got to get going.

548
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:54,958
We've got an interview lined up
with the Garda who investigated.

549
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:57,416
- And then I think Gilbert wanted...
- Where does Sean live?

550
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,541
Um...

551
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,750
It's...

552
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:02,500
Oh, "27 Portola Road."

553
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:04,708
- We should start there.
- Why?

554
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:06,666
Just a hunch.

555
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:09,875
Okay. But, um, as I said,
we do need to get going, and...

556
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:11,916
Oh, you can do your own thing, Sizergh.

557
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,541
I actually just prefer to be called Emmy.

558
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:18,375
Emmy's a very twee name.
Like you're a BrontÃ« sister or something.

559
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:21,250
Why be an "Emmy"
when you can be a "Sizergh"?

560
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:23,291
Okay.

561
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:26,125
Also, I think this whole true crime thing
is morally bankrupt.

562
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:28,083
- Okay, yeah.
- It's just a distraction.

563
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:31,458
That's what true crime podcasts are,
like a public hanging.

564
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:34,041
[mouth full] There's a story here
that actually matters.

565
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:36,500
I think Sean knows something about it.

566
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:38,791
We should probably
stick together though, right?

567
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:40,291
No.

568
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:46,458
[door closes]

569
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:49,416
- [softly] Oh, thank you.
- [ringing tone]

570
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,916
[sighs]

571
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,875
- [ringing tone]
- [line clicks]

572
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,125
[Sean, on voicemail] <i>It's your boy, Sean.</i>

573
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:56,848
<i>- Actually, it's your...</i>
- I'm not hungry.

574
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,916
[whimsical intriguing music playing]

575
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:10,791
Portola... Road.

576
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:40,291
[under breath] Fuck's sake.

577
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:42,875
So first, we'll try the cousin, Bridgit.

578
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:44,878
See if she'll talk to us
about the missing woman.

579
00:27:44,916 --> 00:27:46,458
- Fiona. Yeah.
- Right, yes.

580
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,500
And then, um...

581
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,958
Sergeant Ruairi Power was the local Garda
when the disappearances happened.

582
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:54,142
- Apparently, he's still working.
- His name is Power.

583
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:57,291
- Uh, yes, Sergeant Ruairi Power.
- It'd be cool if we were related.

584
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,250
[Emmy] Mm.

585
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:00,625
- I think it's a pretty common name here.
- Hmm.

586
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,333
Distant cousins, maybe.

587
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:04,625
Maybe. [chuckles softly]

588
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:07,375
[whimsical intriguing music continues]

589
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,541
Do you know where Portola Road is?

590
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:17,833
Portola Road? I wouldn't be starting here.

591
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,375
Uh... I need directions.

592
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:22,583
So you must be one of the podcasters.

593
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:25,166
- I just need to find Portola Road.
- [woman] So sad.

594
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,750
She was a lovely girl, Fiona.
Used to teach up at the school.

595
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,833
Course, that closed down long ago. Cuts.

596
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:33,958
You practically have to drive
into Skibbereen now

597
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,916
to find a <i>decent</i> primary school.

598
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,041
Directions? Portola Road, please.

599
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:41,750
[sighs] Oh, I didn't leave my house
for three weeks after that Samhain.

600
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,666
I was terrified.

601
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,500
It was probably some sick murderer,
I've no doubt.

602
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:49,375
I watch a lot of these documentaries.

603
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:52,041
These killers plan these things out,

604
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:56,000
lie in wait for the perfect timing.

605
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,333
[sighs]

606
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:02,041
[Emmy] Sixteen.
This should be where Bridgit lives.

607
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:03,125
[Gilbert] Okay, great.

608
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:04,916
[knocking]

609
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,875
You know, the thing to remember
about these initial conversations

610
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:10,625
is that you need to be
very delicate, okay?

611
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,875
- Yeah?
- Hi there. Are you, uh, Bridgit Pierce?

612
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:16,708
- You the podcasters?
- Yes. Yes, we are.

613
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,000
[door slams]

614
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,083
Okay.

615
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:22,750
Does that happen a lot?

616
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:24,541
[sighs] Occupational hazard.

617
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:27,625
She might come around though
as we spend more time in town.

618
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:29,958
[whimsical intriguing music continues]

619
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:34,708
So... the guard?

620
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:36,416
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

621
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:44,666
[Dove sighs]

622
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:56,833
So what's the plan for the interview?

623
00:29:56,916 --> 00:29:59,083
- Police officers can be tricky.
- Uh, sure.

624
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:01,125
It's good to be, uh, very deferential.

625
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:03,375
They're not used to
being the ones answering questions.

626
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:04,458
Sure, yeah.

627
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:07,083
Um, I tend to just feel my way through.

628
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:10,541
You know, depending on how it's going,
I might take a small risk or two.

629
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:13,750
It's important to keep your eyes open
and look for opportunities,

630
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:16,958
but really, we're just, you know,
trying to establish a rapport

631
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:19,125
so we can follow up later if we need to.

632
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,833
Risk, rapport, opportunity.

633
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:24,875
Hang on. I just wanna write this down.

634
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:26,541
[Gilbert sighs]

635
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,625
[birds chirping]

636
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:32,000
Is it raining? I can't tell.

637
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:34,583
I think it's just sort of a wet breeze.

638
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,333
[man] It's always raining in Ireland.

639
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,375
Even when you think it's dry,
it's still raining.

640
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,041
Only very, very small drops.

641
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:44,125
[Gilbert] Hmm.

642
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,708
We're looking for Sergeant Power.

643
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:53,666
[man] This way.

644
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,416
Um... All right.

645
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,500
[whimsical intriguing music continues]

646
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:12,708
[doorbell chimes]

647
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:39,583
Hello?

648
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:42,958
Sean?

649
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:06,333
[Seamus] Sean!

650
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,625
- [knocking on door]
- [Seamus] Sean, are you there, boy?

651
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:12,666
[keys jingle]

652
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:14,791
[door lock clacks]

653
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:17,541
Is it all sorted?

654
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:20,083
We can't just afford
any more fuck-ups, yeah?

655
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:21,750
You there, Sean?

656
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,125
[sighs]

657
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,958
[tense music playing]

658
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,583
[ringing tone]

659
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,000
- [ringing tone]
- [line clicks]

660
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:40,916
[Sean, on voicemail] <i>It's your boy, Sean.
Actually, it's your boy Sean's phone.</i>

661
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,583
Fuckin' eejit.

662
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:47,208
[door slams]

663
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:55,000
[intriguing music playing]

664
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:08,750
[man] No. I get it.

665
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:10,916
It all sounds like a big mystery.

666
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,208
But truth be told,
there isn't much to tell.

667
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:16,916
Samhain is just a bit of fun.

668
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:20,458
You know, it's why you wear costumes
on Halloween?

669
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:21,916
- Really?
- [man] Oh yeah.

670
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,250
Because in Samhain,
you had to wear a disguise,

671
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:27,291
otherwise, the spirits
of your dead relatives would find you.

672
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:30,750
Well, wouldn't that be nice,
I mean, to see your family again?

673
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:32,625
No. [chuckles]

674
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:35,500
Because if they liked you,
they'd stick around,

675
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:36,916
and no one wants that.

676
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:38,958
And if they didn't like you...

677
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:40,708
[scoffs]...well...

678
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:43,041
best to disguise yourself.

679
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:43,958
[both chuckle]

680
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:45,291
- Milk?
- Oh, no.

681
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:47,541
- Sugar?
- No. Thank you. Thank you.

682
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,833
[splutters] Well, look,
that's so fascinating.

683
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:51,958
You don't think
there's much of a story here?

684
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:53,041
[chuckles]

685
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:54,958
This is rural Ireland.

686
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:57,500
It's not quite what you're used to
back in America,

687
00:33:57,583 --> 00:33:59,125
where you're swimming in crime.

688
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:02,958
I mean, we've never even had
a serial killer in Ireland.

689
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,250
Well, there was the Vanishing Triangle
disappearances in the '90s.

690
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:08,125
Six women gone without a trace.

691
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:11,500
Just because you've never prosecuted
a serial killer doesn't mean you haven't...

692

- [tea pouring]
- [Emmy mutters]

693
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:14,291

[teapot clatters]

695
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:17,708
This is a small town.

696
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:21,791
Things get blown out of proportion.
Rumors spread quickly.

697
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:23,583
But why cancel the festival?

698
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:26,875
Those lads disappeared,
and the festival got the blame.

699
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:30,583
If you ask me, they probably just left
and didn't tell anyone.

700
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:32,333
A bit of Samhain high jinks.

701
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:33,791

- That's all.

702
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,750
[Gilbert] Okay. Okay. Hmm.

703
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:44,166
You know, uh, Sergeant,
you and I have the same last name.

704
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,458
My name is Gilbert Power.

705
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:49,000
[clock ticking]

706
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,000
You don't say.

707
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,291
I do say.

708
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:53,583
Well, how about that.

709
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,250
[both chuckle]

710
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:57,583
We might even be related.

711
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:58,500
Yeah, maybe.

712
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:00,291
- [Sergeant] Huh?
- [Gilbert chuckles]

713
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:03,750
Tell me about this thing you're making.

714
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,875
- A podcast, is it?
- Yes, sir.

715
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:08,791
- And people will listen to it?
- Hm, I hope so.

716
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,250
How about a little Irish twist?

717
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:13,166
Oh, I... I shouldn't.
I overdid it a little bit last night.

718
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,625
Go on. Hair of the dog.

719
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:16,833
[meekly] Thank you.

720
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:19,750
[sighs]

721
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:20,750
For luck.

722
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:23,750
So I guess I'm just curious
about your background.

723
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:26,125
How do you get started
in these things anyway?

724
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,791
Well, I worked in public radio
for a long time, and...

725
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:30,416
And you an assistant?

726
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,625
Well, I'm... I'm a researcher.

727
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:35,458
An assistant researcher, huh?
How about that.

728

- [Emmy] Hmm.

You have a strange method

I'm just taking a break, out on a stroll.

This is a quiet town with good people.

780
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:48,666
And you want to dredge up
all this Samhain nonsense. For why?

781
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,208
For a podcast?

782
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:52,750
I've heard they're popular.

783
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:55,833
And what if we don't want
a podcast made about our town?

784
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:58,375
Did you ever think about that?

785
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:01,375
You know, I read all sorts of things
in the newspapers.

You know the weather's gonna kill us all?

787

So you'd think you'd have something
more important to do

788
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,666
than to come down here and rile us all up.

A folder.
I found it in Sergeant Power's house.

What?

00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,750
When you were putting him down,
I looked around his office and found this.

[splutters] I mean, this is theft.

- We need to take it back.
- You said to look for opportunities. I...

816
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:05,791
No, I meant in the interview.
Opportunities for questions.

817

I didn't mean to steal his property.

818

But it was just lying there.

Imagine if we can solve this.
