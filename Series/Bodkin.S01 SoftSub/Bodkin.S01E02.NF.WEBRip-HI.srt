and you'll be told no lies.</i>

00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:26,333
<i>But when you wanna find the truth,
that's all you have, questions.</i>

6
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:31,833
<i>But the problem with questions
is the answers.</i>

7
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,000
<i>Sometimes the more you learn,</i>

8
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,458
<i>the less you know.</i>

[metal clacks]

11
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,875
[Mrs. O'Shea] Well, I told her
you were comin' over for a visit.

12
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,291
[Sean] I told you, Mam,
I'm not going to Australia.

13
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:56,708
Spiders bigger than your fists,

14
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:59,333

and bite your langer off.

15
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:00,416
[Mrs. O'Shea] Sean.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,791
- [Sean] Mam.
- [Mrs. O'Shea] It's a great opportunity.

17
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,541
[Sean] I don't need opportunities,
Edna, all right?

18
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:08,583
Just enough scratch to hit the ground
when I go back to Romania.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,333
The state of you.

20
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:12,333
Good night, Sean?

21
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:13,250
[chuckles]

22
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:16,375
Ah, you know, a couple of pints,
forget to keep me wits about me.

23
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,916
- You can say that again.
- I was looking for you.

24
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,291
- [Sean] Oh, were you now?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,541
You're a hard man to find.

26
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,250
Oh, he's no hard man, my boy.

27
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:29,125
A softie, inside and out.

28
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,208
Edna.

29
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:32,666
I see your car's been in an accident.

30
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,416
- Occupational hazard.
- Really?

31
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,208
Couple of lads in Killamore
bought themselves a Škoda.

32
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:41,125
Maybe they're trying
to muscle into my taxi turf.

33
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,916
[inhales deeply] Or there's my ex, Sheila.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,500
[Edna] Christ. Sheila.

35
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,500
Held a grudge
ever since I gave her the boot.

36
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,500
To be honest, though, it's...
it's probably just some bored kids.

37
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,083
[Edna] You'll be wanting a bath.

38
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,458
Give the water a few minutes to warm up.

39
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,083
Thanks.

40
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,500
Oh my God. What happened to you?

41
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,750
I got hit by a car and interrogated.

42
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,750
- What?
- Then I see Sean's car's burnt to a crisp.

43
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,041
Well, are you okay?

44
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,416
Someone's trying to sabotage us.

45
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,666
Okay, hang on. Who interrogated you?

46
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,625
I don't know.
They were wearing balaclavas.

47
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:26,708
Balaclavas.

48
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,250
Okay.

49
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,875
Don't take this the wrong way,
but... are you all right?

50
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:35,500
I mean, look, are you sure
it wasn't a misunderstanding?

51
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,291
We are being threatened.

52
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,625
It means there's a story here.

53
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,708
This is extremely good news.

54
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,416
- Right.
- [door opens]

55
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,958
Did you know Sean was Mrs. O'Shea's son?

56
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,416
We should be careful
what we say around him.

57
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,750
["Peacach" by IMLÉ playing]

- [music stops]
- [water running]

63
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,500
So we have Malachy, Fiona, and the boy.

64
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:40,416
I think we should focus on Fiona, right?
Obviously, Bridgit won't talk to us.

65
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,666
But there must be
some folks around who knew her.

66
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,916
You know, what she was like,
who she dated.

67
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,041
Hey.

68
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,458
You, uh...

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You wanna join us?

70
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,250
- [Dove sighs]
- You okay?

71
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,541
Yeah. You?

72
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,791
- [Gilbert] Uh, well, glad you're here.
- Yeah.

73
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,125
Look, I think it's imperative

74
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,583
that we honor the voices
of the people we're talking to.

75
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,583
Offer them respect, consideration.

76
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:14,375
You know, what we can't be
is deceitful and underhanded.

77
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,291
I'm super disappointed
that you stole that file, Emmy.

78
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,333
I'm sorry. It's just you said...

79
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,458
I must have misunderstood.

80
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:26,208
Our work is all about trust.
That's how we get people to open up.

81
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:29,208
And people opening up
is what makes or breaks us.

82
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,833
All right? So... we all on the same page?

83
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,250
Fuck me. Well, this is interesting.

[whimsical music playing]

85
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,666
There's a whole load of reports here
about the missing boy.

86
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,291
He didn't disappear.
He showed up three days later.

87
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,125
- [Emmy] Really?
- Look at this.

88
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,750
His name has been Tipp-Exed out

[keypad clacks]

91
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,208
His name was Edward P.

92
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,375
He was found outside of town
on the side of a road

93
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,416
by a nun called Sister McDonagh.

94
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,833
[sighs] All right, I'm off.
Let me know if you need anything, yeah?

95
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,500
Do you know anyone called Edward P?

96
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,250
I know an Edward Lynch.

97
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,500
Is there any chance he could be the boy
who went missing on Samhain?

98
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,583
No, Lynchy is a sex pervert.

99
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,916
I'd steer well clear of him.
Hmm? [smacks lips]

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,041
If you see Edna,
will you let her know I've gone?

00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:30,208

seems to live on an island off the coast.

"Inish Mac Tire."

107
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,291
There's four ferries a day.
I'll book us some seats.

108
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,083
- [chuckles softly]
- [keyboard clacking]

109
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,291
So, are we all on the same page, Gilbert?

110
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,166
Well, you know,
it worked out this time, but, uh...

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,416
we need to stick to the rules from now on.

112
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500

[Gilbert] Thanks.

116
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,208
- Okay.
- [Emmy] That's so nice of you. Thank you.

117
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,291
Thanks.

[convent bell clanging]

119
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,208
Hey, can I take pictures,
or is that sacrilegious?

120
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,666
You know what, I'm gonna do it.
It'd be great for the website.

121

[camera shutter clicking]

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,125
You must be the podcasters, yes?

123
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,458
Hi. My name's Emmy Sizergh.
I called ahead.

124
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:41,166
Then you are Mr. Power and Miss Maloney.

125
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,166
That's us.

126
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,291
[nun] Wonderful.

127
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,583
I am Reverend Mother Bernadette.

128
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,041
I thought I'd offer you
a personal tour myself.

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,166
It isn't often
we have such esteemed visitors.

130
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,125
[chuckles]

131
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,666
Oh, we're big fans
of yours here, Mr. Power.

132
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,750
Really?

133
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,625
[Bernadette] We're fiends
for a good podcast.

134
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:08,125
The first season of <i>On Record</i>
was so profound.

135
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,250
You were so... brave

136
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:15,541
to be that open about
the difficult times in your marriage.

137
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,041
Thank you. [chuckles]

138
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:22,208
Of course, seasons two
and three were... a little disappointing.

139
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,333
Oh.

140
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,166
Let's begin.

141
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,958
And of course,
we'd like to chat with Sister McDonagh.

142
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:34,708
Oh, I'm afraid our dear sister's
not one for visitors these days.

143
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,333
She's a bit long in the tooth.

144
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,166
But I'll see what I can do.

145
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,916
- Please.
- [whispers] Long in the tooth?

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,375
Sister Bernadette must be
at least 80 herself.

147
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,666
Nuns live forever.

148
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,375
It's a curse.

149
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:53,250
So the church dates from the 12th century.

150
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,125
Originally a medieval castle,

151
00:07:56,208 --> 00:08:00,416
the Sisters of Mercy took it over
about, well, a hundred years ago.

152
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,791
[Gilbert] Must be wonderful.

153
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:05,833
You know, a life of quiet reflection,
of commitment to God.

154
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,000
A truly spiritual existence.

155
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,458
Originally, yes.

156
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,041
But in the 1980s,

157
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:16,875
our branch of the order decided
we needed to be more open to the world.

158
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:17,791
[gong chimes]

159
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:22,666
We like to do the yoga outside
when the sun is shining.

160
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,708
- [bell dings]
- [yoga instructor chatters]

161
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:29,750
[Bernadette] Shiatsu and Reiki
are private sessions

162
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,250
done down by the beehive huts.

163
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:36,666
On the other side of the island
are the organic gardens.

164
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,416
- Grow our own, slaughter our own.
- [yoga instructor chanting]

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,625
- Whoa.
- Do you mind?

166
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,708
No. Please.

167
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,875
[women singing chant]

168
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,000
[Gilbert] Emmy,
get the release forms ready.

169
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,125
I can't help but think
what the Church might say

170
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,458
about your little
money-making retreat here.

171
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,541
Ah. [chuckles]

172
00:08:56,625 --> 00:09:01,083
We had a schism back in the '80s.
The order was desanctified.

173
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,916
Officially, we're no longer
a part of the Church.

174
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,708
Then why are you still nuns?

175
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,458
Because that's who we are.

176
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:15,250
But I do have a question
about who <i>you</i> are.

177
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,333
"Dove."

178
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,666
Is that short for Dubheasa?

179
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,375
Dubheasa Maloney?

180
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,559
- Word travels.
- [unsettling music plays]

181
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:29,416
I remember hearing
about a young girl in Dublin,

182
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,666
years ago,

183
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:34,666
who started a fire in an abbey.

184
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,625
Her name was Dubheasa Maloney too.

185
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,500
Quite disturbed, they say.

186
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:44,708
But it couldn't possibly be
the same girleen, now, could it?

187
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,208
Mr. Power, shall we?

188
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,875
[music fading out]

189
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,625
And of course, our restaurant
has gained quite a bit of attention.

190
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,916
Two of our sisters
trained under Jamie Oliver.

191
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,833
Wow.

192
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,541
And when do you think
we'll get to talk to Sister McDonagh?

193
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,625
Well, let's take a look at our spa first.

194
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,166
[nuns chattering indistinctly]

195
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,333
[Dove] Sorry. You don't know
where Sister McDonagh might be?

196
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,875
I'm her niece, down from Dublin.

197
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,833
Oh, she's upstairs.
Third floor, at the end of the hall.

198
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,166
You're a lifesaver.

199
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,250
- [fire alarm blaring]
- [Bernadette grumbles]

200
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,208
Excuse me just a moment.

201
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,291
Yeah, of course.

202
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,500
[alarm continues]

203
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,583
Huh.

204
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,708
Let's head to the third floor.
McDonagh's up there.

205
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,458
But shouldn't we wait
for Mother Bernadette?

206
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,791
Oh, don't worry, Gilbert.

207
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,500
It'll be grand.

208
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,041
[intriguing music playing]

209
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,583

[respirator whirring softly]

211
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,708
[Gilbert] Ah, she doesn't look so good.

212
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,208
Are you sure this is okay?

213
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,666
Believe me, Gilbert,
she'll be as sharp as ever.

214
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,458
Nuns are like wine.
Eventually, they end up as vinegar.

215
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,125
[respirator whirring softly]

216
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,083
Hello.

217
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,083
Sister, we need to ask you some questions.

218
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,166
Questions?

219
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,000
What time is it?

220
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,916
Have I missed vespers?

221
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,583
Samhain, 20-something years ago,
you found a boy. Edward.

222
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,041
Have we met?

223
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,500
Such lovely skin.

224
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,166
Y-You found a boy at the side of the road.

225
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,041
A boy?

226
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,416
Hi, Sister.

227
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:58,833
My name's Gilbert.

228
00:11:58,875 --> 00:11:59,916
Hello.

229
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,750
So Mother Bernadette tells us
you're quite a fan of podcasts.

230
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,166
[chuckles] Oh, I love a good podcast.

231
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:10,458
I've just been listening to the one
all about these twin brothers

232
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,291
who killed all those poor orphans.

233
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,625
[chuckles softly]

234
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,500
- It was very grisly.
- [Gilbert chuckles]

235
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:20,541
Well, we're making a podcast right now,
and we <i>really</i> need your help.

236
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,708
Hmm. What's it about?

237
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,208
Well, it's about the people
who disappeared on Samhain.

238
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,125
- [Sister McDonagh] Oh. That whole thing.
- [Gilbert] Yeah.

239
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:31,666
I don't think I've anything
terribly interesting to say.

240
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,666
- Just tell us about the boy.
- Dove!

241
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,208
Look, you wouldn't believe

242
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,500
how interested I am
in what you have to say.

243
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:44,500
So, we heard
that you found the missing boy?

244
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,083
Oh. [huffs]

245
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,291
[mutters hesitantly]

246
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,875
It... it... it was days after Samhain.

247
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,958
I was driving into town,

248
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:55,208
and the lad was standing
by the side of the road.

249
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,083
Huh. W-Was he lost?

250
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,083
He didn't know where he was.

251
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,208
He didn't know who he was, to be honest.

252
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,750
I drove him into town
and dropped him at the health center.

253
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,083
Did he talk to you?

254
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,333
Sure. He was on about fishing.

255
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,625
Something about a boat.

256
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:15,916
Rowing.

257
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,000
It was such a long time ago.

258
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,875
I... I... I can't remember. [chuckles]

259
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,416
Yeah. Did you ever see him again?

260
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,541
Sure. I see him all the time.

261
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,833
Wait. Y-You see him all the time?

262
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:31,625
I'm partial to a little scoopeen
when I get into town.

263
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,208
And Teddy's often at Fagan's, isn't he?

264
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,666
- [intriguing music playing]
- But... Teddy?

265
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,083
The singer? At Fagan's?

266
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,166
That's the one. Lovely lad he is.

267
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,458
Voice of an angel, mind of a cabbage.

268
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,875
- [door opens]
- What on earth is going on here?

269
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,500
I mean, what were you thinking, Dove?

270
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,208
You said, "Oh, it'll be grand."

271
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,000
It was grand. We got what we needed.

272
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,125
No, it... it... it was not grand.

273
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:02,166
You know, Bernadette said
she would sue us if we use the audio.

274
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,083
We don't need it.

275
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,666
Yes, we do.

276
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:09,000
All right? It... it's the whole point
of making a podcast, to get audio.

277
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,250
We need their words.

278
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,666
Now that Bernadette's
all pissed off at us,

279
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,333
we have no hope of getting any.

280
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,642
Bernadette was giving us the runaround.
We'd never have...

281
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,625
Yes, we would have,
with a little patience.

282
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,458
[sighs] Look,

283
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:27,000
we need to take our time
and get people to trust us.

284
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,250
You don't understand, Gilbert.

285
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,208
D'you think no one in this town knew
Teddy was the boy?

286
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,750
Everyone here will talk you in circles.

287
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,500
We do it your way, we find out nothing.

288
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:42,083
Journalism isn't just
squeezing people for information.

289
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:46,375
We're here to build relationships.
I mean, we need this podcast, Dove.

290
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:47,958
We need it.

291
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,250
Nuns are just children.

292
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:54,291
Children in old women's bodies,
dressed in black, and married to Jesus.

293
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,375
We are better off without.

- What's the craic?
- What's Teddy's surname?

298
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,916
Teddy? You mean Teddy Power?

299
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,583
Edward P.

300
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,583
Another Power. I wonder if we're related.

301
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,458
I think it's more likely
he's related to Sergeant Power,

302
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:24,375
the guard who happened to write the report
that happened not to mention Teddy's name.

303
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,125
- Interesting theory.
- Do you know where we'd find Teddy?

304
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,333
He has a workshop
up the Terrace Road, I think.

305
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,416
Let's head there, then.

306
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,708
Is this safe, Sean?

307
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,500

00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,333
She was your friend, Fiona?

348
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,458
[soft spoken] Teacher, not friend.

349
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,458
But you liked her?

350
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,750
[Teddy] Mm.

351
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,666
I had a teacher in the convent.

352
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,958
- [Teddy exhales softly]
- Sister Geraldine.

353
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,666
She was my best friend. Isn't that sad?

354
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:22,208
I was 16, and she could only have been
a few years older than me.

355
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,666
A girl teaching girls.

356
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,333
[tape unravels]

357
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,916
We'd hide in the cloisters
and smoke at lunch.

358
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,083
[tape snaps]

359
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,791
[inhales deeply]

360
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,166
[sighs]

361
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:39,000
Fiona would... take me home after school,

362
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,208
so I wouldn't be alone.

363
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,041
[bandage rustles]

364
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,375
She made me dinner,

365
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,208
told me stories.

366
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,083
I'd make a fire in the front room.

367
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,875
What was your favorite story?

368
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,250
I mean, she loved Gráinne Mhaol.

369
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,791
The Pirate Queen.

370
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,375
I love her.

371
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,750
Fiona said she bowed to no man.

372
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,125
[door squeals, clangs]

373
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,392
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- Sergeant Power, we...

374
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,333
You've got no right to barge in here
and talk to my son!

375
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,216
He's a grown man.
He can talk to who he likes.

376
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,708
- Get out! Now!
- We were just chatting...

377
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:22,000
I don't care!
Get out or I'll arrest you for harassment.

378
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,083
Out!

379
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,333
[somber intriguing music playing]

380
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,091
You three have no business with him,
and he's got no business with you.

381
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,083
- Sergeant...
- Podcast, my hole!

382
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,833
He's a vulnerable young man,
ye pack of vultures.

383
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,666
Well, that was interesting.

384
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,416
That's two interviews blown in one day.

385
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,750
That was amazing, Dove,
about your teacher.

386
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:54,666
What?

387
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,208
Oh, that was bollocks.

388
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,041
See how nervous Power was?

389
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,000
- We're getting close to something.
- No. No, we're not, Dove.

390
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,750
They're clearly hiding something.

391
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,166
It doesn't matter.

392
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,333
Look, there's an island of nuns
teaching yoga,

393
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,875
and I can't use the audio.

394
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,208
We actually found the missing boy,
and I can't use the audio.

395
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,791
- Guys.
- If there's no audio, there's no story.

396
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:17,875
No story?

397
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,208
I got hit by a car and threatened.
Sean's car got set on fire.

398
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,208
Power is clearly covering something.

399
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,416
Look, Teddy, Fiona,
and Malachy disappeared.

400
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,000
What happened that night
is still important to someone.

401
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,916
The story is right here.
We just have to find it.

402
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,833
Guys...

403
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,833
Have you ever listened to a podcast
where they actually solve it?

404
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,416
- [scoffs]
- I... I... I need diversions.

405
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,125
Red herrings, human interest.

406
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,458
The stuff that people
actually care about. All right?

407
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,041
- W-Without audio, it's all pointless.
- [Emmy] Guys!

408
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,125
- What?
- What?

409
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,250
Where's Sean?

410
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,333
[sheep bleating]

411
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,583
- This is where we left him.
- [Dove sighs]

412
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,666
[Gilbert sighs]

413
00:20:56,541 --> 00:21:01,625
[cell phone vibrating]

414
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,750
[vibrates]

415
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,416
- [sighs]
- [phone vibrates]

416
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,625
It's a note from Sean.
"Needed to see a man about some business."

417
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,500
- Well, what are we supposed to do, walk?
- I guess.

418
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,045
- [Damien] <i>We've got a bit of a problem.</i>
- Go on.

419
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,000
[Damien] <i>There's no nice way to spin this.</i>

420
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,333
<i>The police have subpoenaed your emails.</i>

421
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,125
<i>Now, obviously,
we're doing everything we can to fight it,</i>

422
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,833
<i>but they're talking
the Official Secrets Act.</i>

423
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,625
I didn't do anything.

424
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:30,666
- The Secrets Act means prison, Damien.
- [Damien] <i>No one is going to prison.</i>

425
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,958
<i>No. And we're doing everything
we can this end.</i>

426
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,583
- I should come home.
- [Damien] <i>Absolutely not. I know you.</i>

427
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,083
<i>You come back, kick off,
and just make everything worse.</i>

428
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,541
<i>Stay in Bodkin. Keep your head down.</i>

429
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,958
<i>- Let the lawyers take care of it.</i>
- Fuck.

430
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,041
[keypad clacks]

431
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,750
[breathes anxiously, sniffs]

432
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,166
[Emmy] Everything okay?

433
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,333
Aren't we walking?

434
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:02,500
We should follow Power. He was rattled.
See where he goes, who he talks to.

435
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,416
Wait, wait. What are you talking about?

436
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,166
That is literally the opposite
of what we need to do.

437
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,541
I mean, if anything,
I should go apologize to him,

438
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,250
try to rebuild our relationship.

439
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,333
Relationship? He's guilty as sin.

440
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,750
Oh, come on.

441
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,333
You gotta stop jumping to conclusions.

442
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:21,041
Teddy was traumatized as a boy.
Power is trying to protect him.

443
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:24,045
- That doesn't mean there's a conspiracy.
- [Darragh] Gilbert! How are ye?

444
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:25,791
[Gilbert] Darragh! Hey!

445
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,470
[Darragh] I heard Frank
was looking for you.

446
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,333
- [Gilbert] Frank?
- [Darragh] Be careful with that one.

447
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,041
I don't think I know a Frank.

448
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,791
Sure. Says he knows you from Fagan's.

449
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,375
Oh.

450
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,458
So, uh, do you have a second?

451
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:42,541
- [Darragh] Yeah.
- Oh.

452
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,333
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting my audio.

453
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:49,458
[cattle lowing]

454
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:52,416
So, uh, is this the melancholy one?

455
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,916
Yeah, his friend died.

456
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,958
Oh, poor guy. What happened?

457
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,083
I ate him.

458
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,458
Oh. Hmm.

459
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:02,125
So, is this all your land?

460
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,833
Yeah, 200 acres.

461
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,105
From Ailbhe's Hollow down to the sea.

462
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:08,250
- Ah.
- Been in the family for generations.

463
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,125
Oh, wow. That's a lotta land. [chuckles]

464
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,333
Well, it keeps me busy,
I'm proud to say that.

465
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:16,208
Other than the odd dip into town,
I've never left the land.

466
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,791
[Gilbert] What?

467
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:21,416
But... but, uh, don't you get curious
about what's out there?

468
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,875
I'm a very curious man.

469
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,000
Every day, I'm filled with wonder.

470
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,875
When the lambs frolic in the spring.

471
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,458
When the wren sings in the morning.

472
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
When I was a boy,

473
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:36,125
I watched a horde of eels
wriggle their way down to the river.

474
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,166
This land is full of stories.

475
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,750
I never tire from hearing them.

476
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,500
So, why would I leave?

477
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,875
That's... beautiful.

478
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,791
And who's going to work the farm
when artificial intelligence kicks in?

479
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:51,958
Huh? [chuckles]

480
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:53,791
You can't deepfake roast beef.

481
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:57,250
That is a good point.
Did... did you get that, Gilbert?

482
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,875
So, uh, do you know Teddy at all?

483
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,250
[Darragh] Sure. Since he was a boy.

484
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,666
Quite the charmer, he was.

485
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,250
Until...

486
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,416
Well, you know.

487
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,833
What about Fiona Doyle?

488
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:14,208
Teddy used to follow her around
like a puppy, so he did.

489
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,291
Do you know if he knew Malachy O'Connor?

490
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:18,208
- Malachy?
- [unsettling music playing]

491
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,125
What about him?

492
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,833
Well, they all disappeared that night.

493
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,375
[Gilbert] Can't help but wonder
if they're connected.

494
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,375
I wouldn't know anything
about that. [chuckles]

495
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:26,541
Did you know Malachy?

496
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:29,416
Know him?
How well do you really know anybody?

497
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,666
It's just a question.

498
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,208
Yeah, well, questions are
what gets one into trouble.

499
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,791
You ask the wrong person a question,

500
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,835
you get a rock in your gob
and teeth on the floor.

501
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:40,833
- [splutters] We were just...
- Look, Malachy's gone over 20 years now.

502
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:46,083
You can ask all the questions you want.
Doesn't matter now.

503
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,041
[unsettling music continues]

504
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,291
What was that?

505
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:57,083
That... is a man
who knows more than he's tellin'.

506
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,041
[intriguing music playing]

507
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,416
[woman] Took you long enough.

508
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,583
Yeah, I had business.

509
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,375
Come on.

510
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,000
Ah, now you're in a hurry?

511
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:20,166
Savage.

512
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:23,166
[music fades out]

513
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:32,208
[crowd cheering]

514
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,125
Oh Christ.

515
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,208
What's happening?

516
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:37,208
- Oh, don't touch it!
- [man 1] Just leave it.

517
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:38,791
Hey, what's all this?

518
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,500
- Huh?
- [man 2] Road bowling.

519
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,833
And what is road bowling?

520
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:47,625
Ah, it's like golf, with this steel ball,
down the middle of the road.

521
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:50,291
Whoever covers the distance
in the fewest throws wins.

522
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:51,833
- [crowd cheer]
- Just watch. Watch.

523
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:53,958
- [steel ball clattering]
- [crowd cheers]

524
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:58,750
Emmy, we need to record everything.

525
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,666
[crowd chattering indistinctly]

526
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,208
[man 3] How're ya?

527
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:08,995
[man 4] Now, boy, leave it there.
Hey. Leave it there.

528
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,166
- One hundred.
- No.

529
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,041
Thinking of putting a bet on, then?

530
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:14,041
No, I'm not much of a gambler.

531
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:15,916
That's exactly what Frank said.

532
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,958
Wait. Who is Frank?

533
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:19,625
[scoffs]

534
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:23,000
That's how you wanna play it, eh?
Good luck with that one.

535
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,500
- [chuckles]
- [Gilbert sighs]

536
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:27,666
Hey. [chuckles]

537
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,208
Was that Damien on the phone before?

538
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,458
I'm sorry. Are we friends?

539
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,375
Do you wanna go to brunch
and shovel avocado toast down our gobs

540
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:39,166
while we shoot mimosas up our hoops?

541
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:46,458
[sighs] Yeah. It was Damien.
There's some, eh...

542
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:49,416
complications with something we published.

543
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:52,625
The NHS case? With the whistleblower...

544
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:55,208
Yeah, the guy who hung himself
from the fuckin' rafters.

545
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:57,333
Let's just stick to the work, yeah?

546
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,291
That's all that matters.

547
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:03,541
Well, if it isn't my most deadly enemy.

548
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:04,791
[Gilbert chuckles]

549
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:07,125
Yeah, just plotting your downfall.

550
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,791
[chuckles] Very good.

551
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:10,083
[crowd clamor]

552
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:12,750
- [steel ball clattering]
- [crowd cheers]

553
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,416
Have you solved the mystery yet?

554
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,875
Well, the real mystery
is the rules of road bowling.

555
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:19,833
[crowd clamor]

556
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:21,500
- [steel ball clattering]
- [cheering]

557
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,791
You throw a metal ball
down the fucking road.

558
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,750
If you don't make it to the pub,
you've lost.

559
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:26,833
[Gilbert chuckles]

560
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,000
[woman] You know, to be fair,

561
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,416
there's that little turn
in the road there on that hill.

562
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,625
[indistinct chatter]

563
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,625
I didn't mean to intrude
or anything. I'm sorry.

564
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,666
Sure. It's fine.

565
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:43,291
I'm just a huge fan of yours.

566
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,541
I mean, all your early reporting
from Northern Ireland.

567
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,541
That piece about dark money in the city.

568
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,250
You broke that single-handedly.
I really admire that.

569
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:54,291
I really wanna do what you do... one day.

570
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,041
I'm stuck consulting
on a true crime podcast

571
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,708
in the arse-end of nowhere.

572
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:01,791
Big fucking success, me.

573
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:05,083
But while I'm here... names?

574
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:07,875
Um, Barry on the right,
Cathal on the left.

575
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,500
Hey, Barry, Cathal.

576
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:11,458
Hello.

577
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:14,083
[Dove] I, uh... I hear you're a man
who knows things.

578
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:16,416
- Him?
- Well, I don't know about that.

579
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,916
Did you know Fiona Doyle back in the day?

580
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,833
She was a lovely girl.

581
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:25,166
I only lived on the same street as her.
But go on, ask this gowl.

582
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,416
Oh yeah? Well, what was she like?

583
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,041
She was a lovely girl.

584
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,976
- And what about Malachy O'Connor?
- [ball clatters]

585
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,684
- [crowd cheers]
- I've heard some rumblings.

586
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:36,250
Kept to himself, that fella did.

587
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:39,000
Did he have any friends? Um, a job?

588
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,375
A blow-in, he was.

589
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:43,500
Don't know a thing about him,
but he was a mad bowler.

590
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:45,333
[Cathal] Oh, that's right. Mad.

591
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:49,666
He had a smooth action, arm like a gun.
County Cork champion back in the day.

592
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,333
- Isn't that right, Barry?
- 1998, I think.

593
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:57,416
Finnegan was '98.
That would make Malachy '99.

594
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,916
- Finnegan? No, you eejit.
- [Dove sighs]

595
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,240
It couldn't have been Finnegan.

596
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,333
Why not?

597
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:03,875
- Sure, I knew his sister.
- Did ya?

598
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,476
- Yeah.
- What's that got to do with it?

599
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,625
Interesting how not a soul
seems to know a thing about Malachy.

600
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:10,083
What do you think it means?

601
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,583
I think it means it's a fucking mystery.

602
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:17,208
[Gilbert] Hey, what about you?

603
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:20,375
- What about me?
- Hmm. What do you think happened?

604
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,375
[scoffs]

605
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:22,833
No fuckin' idea.

606
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:23,958
Now, come on.

607
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:26,958
What were you doing
during the last Samhain Festival?

608
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:29,541
Nothing. I hadn't moved to town yet.

609
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:30,833
Oh.

610
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:33,708
Thought you were a local.
I mean, you seem so connected.

611
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:34,958
I get around.

612
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:40,375
Oh, then maybe you can answer this for me.
Uh, do you know a guy named Frank?

613
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,791
Oh yeah, the New Age Travelers.
Their camp is just up the road there.

614
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,583
New Age Traveler? What are...

615
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,625
- Hippies, blow-ins.
- Oh. Okay.

616
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:50,625
They started arriving in the '60s.

617
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:54,875
Supposedly, West Cork is the safest place
to survive nuclear fallout.

618
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:56,000
[Gilbert] Hmm.

619
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:59,208
But I think it's because no one here
gives a shite what they get up to.

620
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:03,208
[woman] That's it.
Lovely, lads. Big smile.

621
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:05,333
- [camera shutter clicks]
- Thanks, lads.

622
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,750
Cheers. All right. Thanks.

623
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:10,166
Hello again.

624
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:13,208
Do you often take pictures of the winners?

625
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:15,416
Oh, I've been doing it for 30 years.

626
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,583
Analog, you know.
None of that digital iPhone bollocks.

627
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:21,416
Yeah, wow. Um... Eh, d'you... d'you keep them?

628
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,833
Keep them? Who'd want shots
of them eejits gathering dust?

629
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:28,625
But they publish my pictures
in the local paper, they do.

630
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:29,791
Every year.

631
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:32,750
That is fascinating.

632
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,833
Take out your phone.

633
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:40,583
Look up the local paper.
"Road bowling, '96 to 2001."

634
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:42,791
There should be a photo of Malachy there.

635
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:45,835
Uh, <i>The West Cork Journal</i> isn't online.
It's archived at the local library.

636
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:47,166
- Oh, the library. Great.
- Hey.

637
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,958
We're off to the pub
to celebrate the game. You coming?

638
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:51,458
What?

639
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:54,375
We found a lead, Gilbert,
that might lead to a picture of Malachy.

640
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:55,333
Great.

641
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:57,375
So, we'll pass on the pub, yeah?

642
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,041
Well, you know, I...
I promised the boys that, you know...

643
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,184
You promised "the boys"?
Who the hell are "the boys"?

645
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:10,916
Those are the boys.

646
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,625
Look, come on, we had a good day.

647
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:16,166
It was productive.
It's time for a little R&R.

648
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,000
This isn't some fuckin' holiday, Gilbert.

649
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,420
You wanna know what's going on here,
you're gonna have to force the issue.

650
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:25,125
She okay?

651
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:27,791
Trouble back home.
Fallout from the NHS story.

652
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:29,541
- The one with the dead guy?
- [Emmy] Mm.

653
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:33,250
Maybe you should go with her,
keep her out of trouble.

654
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,958
While you go to the pub with the boys?

655
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:37,250
Yeah.

[breathless] Wait. I'm coming with you.

00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:46,250
- Did Gilbert tell you to do that?
- No. [chuckles]

660
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,333
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

661

A... a party?

Well, yeah. Yeah. Sure.

Oh.

690
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:24,250
You lost your job.

691
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:26,875
The man's still taking money
from your pocket.

692
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:29,541
You're getting non-stop grief at home.

693
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,625
Enough to put you in an early grave.

694
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,750
And on top of that, it's pissin' rain.

695
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:37,500
But for just one moment,

696
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,583
you can sit with yourself
and see the future

697
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,791
and know that at least
one good thing is comin'.

698
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:46,541
[chuckles softly]

699
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And that,

700
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:50,666
that's a rare thing, Gilbert Power.

701
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:53,583
To know the future holds
something positive.

702
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,458
Hey, um,

703
00:33:58,541 --> 00:34:02,666
do you mind if I could get you
to just say that again?

704
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,000
Just... Yeah, here.

705
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:07,958
Why would you ruin a lovely conversation
with a thing like that?

706
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:11,416
I don't want to remember
the things I've said.

707
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:20,333
I'll be taking that.

708
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:22,333
Let's just call it
a down payment, shall we?

709
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:24,125
- For?
- [chuckles]

710
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:26,208
Were you so pissed you don't remember?

711
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:30,000
Hi. Wha... Um.

712
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,666
You got into a little game
with my mate Frank.

713
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:35,333
Frank?

714
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,875
So he's looking to collect.

715
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:40,958
- Eight thousand euros, boyo.
- What?

716
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:44,416
You lost 8K to Frank here.

717
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,541
Okay. [splutters]

718
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,041
I don't remember any of that.

719
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:51,083
I mean, are you sure it was... it was me?

720
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:52,916
Eight thousand...

<i>- Aw!</i>
- [Gilbert sighs]

724
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:01,291
- That's me. Um...
- Mm-hmm.

725
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:04,500
Look, I... I... I don't have that
just laying around.

726
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:07,666
- I'm having some cash flow issues.
- [Frank] Hey.

727
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,291
You owe me 8,000 euro, you prick.

728
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,541
Hey, hey, Frank, the lad'll pay.

Okay.

Right. Who's for a drink?

733

[chuckles] I mean, I could I think.
But, um, y'know, the library's closed.

[inhales sharply] Sizergh, where are ya?

746
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:07,416
- Bodkin.
- And who are you with?

747
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,333
- You. [chuckles]
- And what do I want?

748
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:12,250
To get into the library, which is closed.

749
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,166
Exactly.

750
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,250
This library, which could contain
a crucial piece of our investigation,

751
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:17,166
is closed.

[hesitates] A-A window.

754
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:23,375
- An open window.
- [softly] Open window.

755
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:24,958
You admire me, right?

756
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:27,875
You know how I got where I am?

757
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:30,708
By going through the fuckin' window.

Oh fuck. We found him.

This is a picture of Malachy O'Connor
one year before he disappeared.

800

And this is Seamus Gallagher.

801
00:38:58,625 --> 00:38:59,750
Oh my God.

802
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,000
- Only his name isn't Seamus.
- What?

803
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:05,833
His real name is Jack McFadden,
also known as "the Badger."

804
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:08,166
My first job was on the Belfast beat.

805
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,916
The Badger was infamous
for smuggling across the border

806
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,500
before the Good Friday Agreement.

807
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:16,083
Petrol, arms, drugs,
anything that needed moving.

808

Kneecapping, murder.

810
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:22,416
Not a man to fuck with.

811
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:26,916
Seamus? Really?
I mean, he seems like such a nice guy.

812
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Ah, he's not.

for 20 years in Bodkin

815
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:37,041
under the name Seamus Gallagher.

816
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:41,833
A violent smuggler arrives in town
at the same time two people disappear?

817
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:43,625
- A coincidence?
- Really?

818
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,916
I mean, this barely looks like him.

819
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,958
Seamus is the Badger.

820
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:51,041
There's a reason he's in Bodkin,
and we're gonna find out what it is.
