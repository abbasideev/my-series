I know lying to children
is a special kind of cruelty.

- You don't...
- Maybe if you lied less to your daughter,

shooting seagulls out of the sky.

What about the ethics of you paying off
your gambling debts with Seamus's money?

Now you're pallin' around with him?

557
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,583
I suppose you told him everything.

558
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:52,208
About Power,
about the car, about the bodies.

559
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,811
- That's not what happened. I...
- What did you say about Power?

560
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:58,750
I told you not to tell him
the bodies were in Power's car.

583
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:16,458
So...

00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:22,750

Teddy...

But the blood!

00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,708
[breathes heavily] Then they were gone.

You're innocent, Teddy.

But what your father did,
it's not right. It's not.

00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:41,208
It will.

he murdered Malachy and Fiona.

643

but you've got to promise
to protect Teddy.

644
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:02,833
Protect him from who?

645
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:05,208
From Seamus. He was just here.

646
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:09,750
I was trying to get Fiona
and Malachy out of town that night,

[breathes nervously] I went out

No! I was never protecting us from jail!

00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:39,708
So you're the victim here?

701
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:40,791
Bullshit.

No.

It's obvious. She's the power,
and you want that power.

707
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:54,208
So you're willing to do whatever she asks.
You're the beta to her alpha.

I'm not a beta.

You tricked me, manipulated me,
all because she asked you to.

711

So either you're desperate
for her approval

712
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,375
or you're a sociopath.

713

Well, it seems
they didn't come home last night either.

I'm supposed to do with all this.
