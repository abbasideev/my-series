[Gilbert] <i>I thought these bodies
were the end of my story,</i>

4
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,125
<i>the answers I'd been looking for.</i>

00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,458
<i>But sometimes,</i>

6
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,166
<i>the dead have their own agenda.</i>

[chatter on police radio]

8
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,750
[Ruairi] All right, folks, show's over.
Everybody go home.

9
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,791
Ah, Sergeant,
would you like to ask me a few...

10
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:43,083
- Thanks, Barry, Cathal. Home.
- You're a bit late, Sergeant.

11
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,926
[Ruairi] This is an official
crime scene now.

12
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,041
Everybody, go home!

13
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,541
[indistinct chatter]

14
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,036
- [Eoin] Go on, go on.
- Hey.

15
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,458
- [Eoin] Go on.
- Have we solved the mystery?

16
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,833
That'd be amazing.
We've only been here a few days.

17
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,958
Seamus killed them.

18
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,666
No. He said he didn't know
what happened to them.

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,666
Because killers always tell the truth.

20
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:07,125
Leave now, or I'll arrest ye.

21
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:08,916
We should go.

22
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,375
[Emmy] Where's Sean?
He was here a few minutes ago.

23
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:19,708
[Dove scoffs]

24
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,583
- I'll call him.
- Fucking Sean.

25
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:24,125
How much are you paying him
to never be around?

26
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,666
- Yeah, he seems very busy.
- I can't find my phone.

27
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,083
- I must have left it in his car.
- Here. Use mine.

28

[phone unlocks]

29
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,000

["Peacach" by IMLÃ‰ playing]

36
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:50,875
There's my phone, in Sean's car,
over near Darragh's.

37
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,833
And how are we supposed to get there?

38
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,750

[Emmy] What was that?

48

- [children laughing, chattering]
- [popping]

- [girl 2] Yes!

- [girl 1] Oh my God.
- [boy 1] Oh man.

52
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,583
- [boy 2] Look at the guts on that yoke!
- [boy 1] All sorts come out of that.

53
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,833
- [Emmy] There's Sean's car.

- [in English] Were they talking about me?

63
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,708
Where the fuck were you?
You were late again.

64
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,125
Yeah, I tried to tell ya.

65
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,875
The podcasters found a pair of bodies
in the bog.

66
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
- What?
- Yeah, in the boot of a car.

67
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,892
- [air gun pops]
- [boy 1] Woo-hoo!

[gulls squawking]

69
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,791
What are you giving children air guns for?

70
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,041
For the...

71
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,083
When I told you to get rid
of the seagulls, I meant fuckin',

72
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,708
uh, poison or something.

73
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:40,958
Fuck.

74
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,000
Send your flunkies home.

75
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,083
[Dove] Did you see that?

76
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,833
The haunted look of a guilty man.

77
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,583
Looked more like shock,

78
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,625
or surprise.

79
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:53,833
All right, lads, come on.

80
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,750
Come on. Fuck off.
You heard him. Let's go.

81
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,601
- Pick up the pace.
- [boy 2] You're not getting these back.

82
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,291
[Sean] Actually, give me back the guns.

83
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,791
- [girl 1] Catch me if you can!
- Give me the guns! Hey!

84
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,083
- Bunch of... [mutters]
- [children laughing]

85
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,750
- [boy 2 jeers]
- [Sean] Give me the guns, please!

86
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,500
[boy 1] Go! Sketch! Sketch! Go!

89
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,500
I saw those two in the pub
giving money to Sean.

90
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,208
Whatever's going on here, Gilbert,
your podcast is in that warehouse.

91

[dramatic music playing]

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You need this.

[machinery whirring]

94
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,833
[Emmy] What is this place?

95
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,625
We'll just have to see, won't we?

96
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,855
[Emmy] What do you think is in there?

97
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,208
[Gilbert] It's so creepy.

00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,291

[Emmy] Can you see anything?

101
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:26,833
Be careful, Dove.

102
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,666
[wood creaking]

103
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,375
[Dove] What the...

104
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,958
- [wood groans, snaps]
- [Dove] Fuck!

105
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,666
Oh my God, Dove!

106
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,250
- Dove? Dove, are you okay?
- [Gilbert] Dove?

107
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,125
- [Emmy] Can you hear me?
- [Gilbert] Dove?

108
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,916
- [Emmy] What do we do?
- [Dove] I'm okay!

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,125
- [Emmy] Okay.
- [gasps] I'm okay!

110
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:46,416
[grunting]

111
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,666
[groans, splutters]

112
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,208
[gasps]

113
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,291
I'm okay!

114
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,250
I'm grand.

115
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,958
[huffing]

116
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,041
[Emmy] Oh my God.

117
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:01,791
What?

118
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,916
There is something

119
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:05,875
wriggling.

120
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,125
Get them off me! [breath trembles]

121
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,250
[whimpering]

122
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,708
[panting] What...

123
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,750
What the fuck are they?

124
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,166
[woman] Juvenile Anguilla anguilla.

125
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,583
They're eels.

126
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,666
- [gun cocks]
- Baby eels.

127
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,375
You've got to be fucking kiddin'.

128
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,500
[breathless] You two, from the car.

129
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,916
Get down here now.

130
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,166
[woman] Down.

131
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,625
On the floor.

132
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:34,750
Now.

133
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,083
[Emmy] Sorry. Who are you?

134
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,833
They're the ones that ran me over.

135
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh my God. You were at the pub.

136
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,708
- We're from Interpol.
- Bullshit.

137
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,625
Wildlife Crimes
and Environmental Action Group.

138
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,333
Wildlife what?

139
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:54,166
Bodkin is the center of an international
eel smuggling operation.

140
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,125
- Eels?
- Seriously?

141
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,750
Yes... eels.

142
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,291
And if you jeopardize
any part of this operation,

143
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,250
we'll shut down your podcast
and arrest all of you.

144
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,208
Sorry. You ran me over for fuckin' eels?

145
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,416
You came outta nowhere.

146
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,291
[woman] Stay away from this warehouse.

147
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:14,625
And most importantly,
stay away from Seamus Gallagher. Got it?

148
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,708
[threatening music playing]

149
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:24,875
Oh my God. Eel smuggling is the biggest
animal trafficking crime in the world.

150
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:28,500
Eel populations are dwindling,
but they're a cultural delicacy worldwide,

151
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,541
especially Japan,
so the prices are soaring.

152
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:31,541
Yeah, <i>unagi.</i>

153
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,208
And they're so valuable,
international gangs are now muscling in.

154
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,416
No wonder Interpol are involved.

155
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,708
They can't even arrest anyone
without begging locals for help.

156
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:43,000
- Interpol are nothing to worry about.
- Eels are actually really interesting.

157
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,375
[Gilbert sighs] Oh God.

158
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,958
[Dove] Gilbert, this is great.

159
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:49,208
Seamus killed his brother
and girlfriend 25 years ago,

160
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,708
and now he's being busted
for international eel smuggling.

161
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,291
You wanted a story.
This one's gonna blow people's heads off.

162
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,250
Except that Interpol are gonna arrest us
if we pursue it.

163
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,291
- Oh, fuck Interpol.
- Is it worth putting ourselves at risk?

164
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,333
Gilbert, you told me you needed a hit.

165
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,250
This is it.

166
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,166
Yeah, but a hit's no good
if we're in prison.

167
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,208
- Gilbert, you need to...
- Look, this is my podcast.

168
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,458
I make the rules.

169
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:13,000
All right, we're... we're following orders,
and we're staying away from Seamus.

170
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,833
End of story. All right?

171
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,041
End of story.

172
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,375
[sighs deeply]

173
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,916
[whimsical music playing]

174
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,208
[Dove sighs softly]

175
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,833

that I have sinned
in my thoughts, words, and deeds,

00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,416

203
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,541
Fine. Yeah. I...

204
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,416
I'll be there.

your lady friend did to me.

Please. Please.
Can we talk about this? I don't have it.

- Finishing breakfast.

Well, what if... you and I
just handle things on our own?

227
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,125
You mean, go after Seamus?

228
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,250
You said you wanna do what I do.

229
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,583
This is your chance.

230
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,166
Do you wanna be an Emmy?

231
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,500
Or do you wanna be a Sizergh?

You have 24 hours to get me my money,

or next time,
this ride ends very differently.

238
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,666
I thought you were a hippie.
What happened to peace and love?

239
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,083
Peace, love,

240
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,458

Fuck.

245
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,708
[Emmy] What are you thinking?

246
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,791
We need to prove
Seamus killed Malachy and Fiona.

247
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,666
Talk to someone who knew Malachy,

248
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,125
but we need to be careful
not to trigger Interpol, right?

249
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,208
Right.

250
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,291
There's always another angle.

251
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,458
Yeah, it... it's Malachy and Seamus.

252
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,541
And?

253
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,666
Who does this look like to you?

254
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,500
Oh shit. It's Sergeant Power.

255
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,416
Bingo.

- Could you sign our petition?

The Samhain Safety Committee believes
we can't possibly have a festival

260
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,833
now we've found two bodies in the bog.

267
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,416
I've got nothing to say to ye.

268
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,541
So Seamus Gallagher is not only
a notorious criminal living in Bodkin

269
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,458
under an assumed identity,

270
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,416
but he's also intimately connected
with Fiona and Malachy.

271
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,233
I'm guessing you knew that already.

272
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,416
You knew Malachy.

273
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,333
You knew Seamus.

274
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,875
Who knows what else you're hiding?

275
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,416
You fancy yourself
a real Agatha Christie, don't ya?

276
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,541
I think Seamus discovered
Malachy was shifting his girl.

277
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,083
I think he killed them both.

278
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,833
And I think you had
something to do with it.

279
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,791
Bollocks. That's a fantasy.

280
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,916
Well, that's what our podcast
is gonna say.

281
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,181
Unless you wanna set the record straight.

282
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,833
There was no affair.

283
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,583
Malachy and Fiona were killed
by the McArdle brothers.

284
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:53,125
The McArdle brothers? What the hell
would they be doing down in Bodkin?

285
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,791
Smugglers have flocked here
for generations.

286
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,916
Tunnels and hidey-holes
all over West Cork.

287
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,250
- Who are the McArdle brothers?
- Gangsters.

288
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,916
Hard men from up north. Very hard men.

289
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,250
I spotted the McArdles in town that night.

290
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,250
Then Fiona and Malachy disappeared.

291
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,541
It wasn't that hard
to put two and two together.

292
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,985
- So why didn't you arrest them?
- [scoffing chuckle] Jesus.

293
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,458
You arrest those nutters.

294
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,083
You should put a stop
to all this podcast nonsense

295
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,750
and leave well enough alone.

296
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:22,750
What about Teddy?

297
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,500
Why did he disappear that night?
Was he involved somehow?

298
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,958
My Teddy had nothing to do
with that night.

299
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,375
He went off to meet
that slimy fuck Fintan McGurk.

300
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,708
Whatever happened to Teddy was his fault,
ya fuckin' wagon.

00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,892
- Why'd you let him speak to you like that?
- [door closes]

304
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,083
Uh, he...

305
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,166
I... I didn't mean to.

306
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,416
Sizergh, do you realize,
everything you say sounds like an apology?

How do you know?

310
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:00,833
Well, it's too easy.

311
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,875
Gangsters from up north pop down to Bodkin
and kill Fiona and Malachy?

312
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,750
And then Seamus just appears
and takes over the business? Nah.

313
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,250
I don't buy it.

314
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,750
Power's coverin' for Seamus.

315
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,375
If we could connect Seamus
to the car in the bog...

316
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:19,083
The car was impounded. I can try
and find out where they've taken it.

317
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,791
I can tell you where the car is.

318
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,250
For 20 euro.

319
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,375
Pay the girl.

320
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,625

Yeah.

Well, the next time you see her,
the first thing you do,

367
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,375
put on some music and move.

Huh?

00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,666

[Gilbert] Is it... about the bodies?

Eh...

377
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:04,666
I've heard about your little money problem
with those fuckin' hippie gobshites.

378
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,166
I could help you with that.

- Really?
- Uh-huh. Eight thousand, was it?

380
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,291
We could smooth that over.

But... why?

382
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,666
Well, I want you to promise
that you won't mention me in your podcast.

383

384
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,375
I just want to be forgotten, Gilbert.

385
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,083
I just want to forget.

386
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,583
And you can afford
to just give me 8,000 euros?

387
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,666
Oh.

388
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,875

- It's fairly interesting.

491

We, uh... We do an awful lot of analysis...

492

- Mm.

496
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,500
[Eoin] Just like I say
at the end of every episode,

497
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:51,000
"Everything you ever needed
to know about life

498
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,392

in the glove compartment.

At least that way he'd stick around.

something that matters. I don't know.

[Dove] Well, can't Daddy set you up
with a cushy corporate well-paid job?

515
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,916
- As a matter of fact, he did.
- And?

516
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,291
Didn't work out.

the wrong person there too?

just fuck off?

[hesitantly] It must be Teddy's.

524
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,375
I agree.

525
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:08,666
Power is covering for Seamus,
and somehow, Teddy's involved.

526
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,375
Well, maybe Teddy saw it happen,
and Power had to hide him for a few days.

527
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:13,625
I agree.

528
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:15,625
If we can prove this is Teddy's,

529
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:18,750
we can use it as leverage
to get Power to tell us who owns the car.

530
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,713
He doesn't want his son involved
in any of this.

531
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:22,666
Teddy's not likely to admit anything.

532
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,208
What was Power talking about,
about Teddy meeting Fintan that night?

533
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:29,916
Fintan told me they were friends,
but they fell out after Samhain.

534
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,846
You think you can get him
to talk to Teddy?

535
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,125
[music continues]

536
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:40,666
Yes.

537
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:50,208
- [Seamus clears throat]
- Uh, um...

538
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:51,708
What are we doing here?

539
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:54,041
I just have a bit of business
to attend to.

540
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,666
I'll be back in a jiffy.

541
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,750
But... [exhales]

542
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:00,333
Okay.

543
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,125
[suspenseful music continues]

544
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,666
[sinister underscore drones]

545
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:13,250
[softly] Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

546
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:15,041
Oh fuck!

547
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:18,250
We represent a consortium
of Japanese seafood buyers.

548
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:21,083
Who lost their supplier
and are looking for a new one.

549
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:24,083
Hmm. You don't look Japanese to me.

550
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,833
The interests we represent are

551
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:30,166
very concerned about privacy.

552
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:33,000
[coughs] Yakuza.

553
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,125
[whispers] Yakuza.

554
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,416
[speaking Japanese]

555
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,520
[in English] What are you looking for?

556
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:45,458
Eels.

557
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:47,541
[gulls calling]

558
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:49,625
[inhales]

559
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:54,500
Do you know that eels are
one of the biggest mysteries in nature?

560
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:58,750
You know, we've been to the moon.
We've split the atom.

561
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:03,458
But we have no fuckin' idea
how eels breed.

562
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:09,250
Huh. And they can live in the sea, rivers...
ponds, even fucking ditches.

563
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,458
And if they want to,
they can squirm over land.

564
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:17,166
And they live to over 100 years old.

565
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,458
So eels are nothing but mystery.

566
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:23,416
And mystery... is magic.

567
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:25,791
So I hope...

568
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:30,125
[chuckling]...we never find out
how eels fuck.

569
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:35,208
Huh? What a cruel and banal world
where we know the truth of everything.

570
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,166
There are some questions

571
00:27:42,416 --> 00:27:44,083
that aren't made to be answered.

572
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:47,708
Hmm?

573
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,250
[smacks lips]

574
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:53,125
We sell flounder,
plaice, and a bit of mullet,

575
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,208
but no eels.

576
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:56,625
It's, uh...

577
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,958
it's illegal to sell eels.

578
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,083
We'll give you twelve hundred per kilo.

579
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:03,708
[tense music playing]

580
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:11,500
How many kilos?

581
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:14,791
Everything you've got.

582
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:20,083
- Fifteen.
- Fourteen.

583
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,166
Fourteen-fifty.

584
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,166
Done.

585
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,041
[shuffling]

586
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:36,208
[speaks Japanese]

587
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:41,125
[man exhales]

588
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,365
[in English] We'll be in touch.

589
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:49,833
[Seamus] Mm.

590
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:55,166
[sighs]

591
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,625
[whispers] Fourteen-fifty?

592
00:28:56,708 --> 00:29:00,375
That's double the Spanish offer!
Fuck me! We'll be dripping in cash.

593
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,458
And, oh, yeah.

594
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,291
W-We should talk about some finder's fee...

595
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,708
Shut the fuck up. How did you meet them?

596
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,166
They approached me.

597
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,333
- Heard about me, like.
- Hmm.

598
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:15,666
Find out all you can about them.
Make sure they're legit.

599
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,625
Yeah, I did. They're fucking sound.

600
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:19,833
Oi, that's 14-fucking-50.

601
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,250
And we can wave goodbye
to those fucking Spanish pricks

602
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,333
Pablo and Hector.

603
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:29,250
Fucking 50. [chuckles]

604
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:40,083
There something wrong?

605
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,250
Uh. Sciatica.

606
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:44,916
- Yeah.
- Oh.

607
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:47,875
Sciatica.

608
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:51,458
My mother used to make
a homemade salve for that.

609
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,250
Oh, Jesus. It smelled like wet dogs.

610
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:58,416
So, uh, how-how did your...
business meeting go?

611
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,708
Aw, that was just a couple of tourists
looking to rent my boat for Samhain.

612
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:04,625
There's a great view of the bonfires
from the harbor.

613
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,333
Do you need to see a doctor?

614
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:11,875
No. No, no, no. It'll work itself out.

615
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:13,041
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

616
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:18,541
Time to head to the bank, right?

617
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,625
[Seamus chuckles]

618
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:22,000
Something like that.

619
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,625
- [machinery beeping]
- [Fintan] How many have you got?

620
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,291
- That's nowhere near enough.
- [construction workers chatter]

621
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:32,000
[Fintan, sternly]
I need more speakers, Claire.

622
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:36,666
I just need it to be loud.
I want the fucking Hollow to be shaking.

623
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:38,583
[knocking]

624
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,666
I'll call you back.

625
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:43,791
What a nice surprise.

626
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,958
Just passing by. [chuckles]

627
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,541
- [Fintan] Really?
- No.

628
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:52,541
I, uh, wanted to call, but...

629
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:54,708
[mumbles]...I was trying to play it cool.

630
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:56,291
Noted. [chuckles]

631
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,000
[clicks tongue, inhales]

632
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:04,166
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said the other night,

633
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,416
about the festival.

634
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,958
[scoffs] It's wild
we're so close to knowing

635
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:09,666
what really happened at the last one.

636
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,333
Bodkin 2.0.
The past is over, right? And we're...

637
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:16,416
We found this near the site
where the bodies were dumped.

638
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,500
[intriguing music playing]

639
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:19,791
So?

640
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:21,958
So... this was Teddy's.

641
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:24,333
It might be linked to the bodies

642
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,176
and to whatever happened
to Teddy that night.

643
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,791
We finally know what happened, but...

644
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:31,666
but not why.

645
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,916
Imagine if we could work out the truth.

646
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,791
- You'd have a great podcast.
- You'd have a great festival.

647
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:41,333
If the mystery was solved before Samhain,
you could put all those questions to bed.

648
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:43,500
The festival could really be a beginning

649
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,041
for you and Bodkin.

650
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:47,750
Bodkin 2.0.

651
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,000
The opposition to you,

652
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:54,041
the plans, the festival,
could all just go away.

653
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,541
What are you suggesting?

654
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:03,500
I think you should take this to Teddy's.

655
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,166
And do what?

656
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,416
Apologize, make amends,
see if this triggers any memories.

657
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:12,875
I'm not gonna apologize
for something I did as a teenager.

658
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:16,166
- It's all in the past now.
- But it's not in the past.

659
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:19,791
Something happened to Teddy,
and if he sees this and remembers,

660
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:21,916
we could solve two murders.

661
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:25,041
And

662
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:28,000
maybe help Teddy find some peace.

663
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,625
No more "Shitpants."

664
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:42,541
[ringing tone]

665
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:44,458
[Damien] <i>Make it brief.</i>

666
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:50,125
Fintan's agreed to talk to Teddy.

667
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:52,791
Good. You'll need to record
their conversation.

668
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:55,000
For the podcast?

669
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:56,666
No. Leverage against Power.

670
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:00,000
No, I-I can't. It's wrong.

671
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:05,416
When I was 12, my mam took me for a walk.

672
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,416
She dropped me at a convent,
and I never saw her again.

673
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,708
I never had anything handed to me.

674
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:15,625
I had to carve a life for myself

675
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:19,000
out of fucking stone,
using my own bloody fingers.

676
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:21,458
So if you want to achieve anything, Emmy,

677
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,291
if you wanna be anything like me,

678
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:26,541
then toughen the fuck up.

679
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:31,083
There has to be another way
besides using people's trauma.

680
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:33,958
All stories are about someone's trauma.

681
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,250
Come on.

682
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,625
You got us this far, Emmy.

683
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:42,083
- Now it's time to bring it home.
- [footsteps approaching]

684
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:43,666
Oh. Hi.

685
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,750
Emmy said you wouldn't mind
bringing us back into town.

686
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:49,083
Sure.

687
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,250
[intriguing music continues]

688
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:55,416
[whispers] It's Sizergh time.

689
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:00,500
[metal belt grinder whizzing]

690
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,083
I don't wanna talk about it.

691
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,583
We used to be friends, Teddy.

692
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,041
Best friends.

693
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:15,000
You threw cow shit at me,
ran off with Siobhan and Michael.

694
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,416
Told me to fuck off.

695
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:18,291
[Fintan] I was an arsehole.

696
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:20,041
Probably still am.

697
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:23,541
[over headphones] <i>I just wanted to...</i>

698
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:24,625
I dunno.

699
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:26,416
Hang with the cool kids.

700
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:28,291
Impress them.

701
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,791
By fucking me over?

702
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:32,458
Yes.

703
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,041
You've been back in town for a year.

704
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,166
Why knock on my door now?

705
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:44,958
Samhain.

706
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:47,916
Brings a lot back up.

707
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:51,416
For what it's worth,
that night went shit for me.

708
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,916
<i>Siobhan gave me some mushrooms
she bought off of those New Age Travelers.</i>

709
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,833
Ran off with the others,
left me tripping my face off.

710
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:01,916
Shat my fucking pants
right there in the woods.

711
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,750
- Really?
- [Fintan] Really.

712
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,125
I had to walk two miles home
smelling like a slurry tank.

713
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,291
[Teddy chuckles softly]

714
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:14,416
What is it with you and shitin' yourself?

715
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,666
[chuckles]

716
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:18,083
[chuckles softly]

717
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:21,333
Teddy... I'm just really fucking sorry.

718
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:22,666
I'm sorry for not showing up,

719
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,250
and I'm sorry for whatever
happened to you that night.

720
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,458
[Teddy sighs]

721
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:29,583
Fuck it.

722
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:31,083
It's over and done.

723
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:34,583
But it's not.
We still don't know what happened to you.

724
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,333
I thought if I could help you
remember what happened...

725
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,500
[inhales nervously]

726
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:45,375
Emmy found this.

727
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:49,250
She thinks it might be a clue
to what happened to you.

728
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,458
Do you recognize it?

729
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:56,791
Is it yours?

730
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,125
[Teddy sighs]

731
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:00,333
[soft nostalgic music playing]

732
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:01,916
It's got my mark, doesn't it?

733
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:04,708
[chuckles softly]

734
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:07,333
I bought it
and gave it to my dad for his birthday.

735
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,333
I was, uh... 11.

736
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:14,125
He acted like
it was the best gift he ever got.

737
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:17,708
Kept it in his car.

738
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:20,000
<i>"For protection," he said.</i>

739
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:23,291
<i>"Scare the baddies away," he said.</i>

740
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,250
Things were different then.

741
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:34,250
[eerie music fading in]

742
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,458
- [disembodied whispering]
- [faint wolf howl]

743
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:42,666
[whispers echoing]

744
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:46,517
- Dove, Teddy gave that knife to Power.
- [music ends]

745
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:48,916
Which means the car we found
in the bog must be Power's.

746
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,333
The car is Power's and not Seamus's?

747
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:53,684
Must have been Power
who walked out of the bog that night.

748
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:55,458
I-I need to hear the recording.

749
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:57,791
Why? I-I told you the important stuff.

750
00:36:57,875 --> 00:36:59,583
Because I wanna hear it for myself.

751
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:02,250
[inhales nervously] No.

752
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,125
- Give it to me.
- Stop it.

753
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:06,666
- Emmy, give me the fucking thing!
- Dove, stop! No! Stop!

754
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,184
- [Dove grunting]
- [Emmy grunts] Ow!

755
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,625
- Dove, get off me!
- [Dove grunting]

756
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,416
[both panting]

757
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,500
Unh! Dove!

758
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:15,166
[grunting]

759
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,750
- [strains] No!
- [Dove grunts]

760
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:18,583
- [sighs]
- [Emmy groans]

761
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:19,500
[Dove pants]

762
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,503
[Teddy] <i>What is it with you
and shitin' yourself?</i>

763
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:23,166
- [Fintan chuckles]
- [Emmy grunts]

764
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,125
[audio garbles]

765
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,767
[Fintan] <i>I'm just really fucking sorry.</i>

766
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:26,951
<i>I'm sorry for not showing up,</i>

767
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,583
<i>and I'm sorry for whatever
happened to you that night.</i>

768
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:31,916
[Teddy sighs] <i>Fuck it.</i>

769
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,726
<i>- It's over and done.</i>
- [Fintan] <i>But it's not.</i>

770
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,833
You recorded us.

771
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:36,809
- I-I can explain, okay?
<i>- We still don't know...</i>

772
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:37,934
- Oh.
<i>- ...what happened to you.</i>

773
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:39,500
- [Emmy] It's not, um...
- No need.

774
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,375
[knife clatters]

775
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:42,583
Fintan!

776
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:45,333
Fintan, please. It's not... It's not what...

777
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:46,875
[car door closes]

778
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:51,958
Christ, Sizergh.

779
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:54,750
That's the second ride
you've lost us today.

780
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,083
What the fuck is wrong with you?

781
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:00,875
You're a fucking monster.

782
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:02,791
[tuts] Ah, sweetheart.

783
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:05,083
I just tell the truth.

784
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,208
Fuck off!

785
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,041
[breathing heavily]

786
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,041
[brakes squeal]

787
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:32,666
Right.

788
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,666
Just give me a minute.

789
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,375
[whistling]

790
00:38:47,666 --> 00:38:49,083
[intriguing music playing]

791
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,750
- [panting]
- [bird cawing]

792
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:04,583
The Hollow?

793
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:06,333
[exhales]

794
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:31,541
[distant clattering]

00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:34,250
[whistling echoes]

796
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,541
[tense music playing]

797
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,458
- [whistling grows louder]
- [Gilbert huffs]

798
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:43,166
[breathing heavily]

799
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,958

00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:46,250
[seatbelt clacks]

802
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:54,583
- [Seamus chuckles]
- [tense music fades out]

803
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:56,416
Right.

804
00:39:58,166 --> 00:39:59,500
[intriguing music resumes]

805
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:01,750
Eight thousand, right?

806
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:06,666
Where did you get this?

807
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:10,416
An entrepreneur always has
something squirreled away for a rainy day.

808
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,916
[breathes heavily]

809
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:18,458
My da never had two pennies
to rub together.

810
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,291
And if he did have a bit of money,
he spent it on drink.

811
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:22,625
[breathes deeply]

812
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:25,291
"No point in having it," he'd say.

813
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,333
"The man's only gonna take it from ya."

814
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:30,916
"Better off investing in a pint of plain."

815
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:35,083
Well, he keeled over when I was 15,

816
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,875
and I promised meself I'd never be poor.

817
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:41,083
I'd look after Malachy.

818
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:43,500
I'd be a real man.

819
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:47,583
[engines starts]

820
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:52,500
[sheep bleating]

821
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,583
[Dove] Emmy.

822
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:55,166
Come on, now, Emmy.

823
00:40:56,208 --> 00:40:57,208
Emmy.

824
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,250
Fine.

825
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:10,125
[people chattering indistinctly]

826
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:18,583
[man] Here, I've one there anyway,
and I think there's more in the back.

827
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:20,958
[woman] Fantastic. Lovely and fresh.

828
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:23,708
- Hiya. Can I take two of them?
- You could, yeah.

829
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:28,541
[Seamus] How are ya, Frank?

830
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,458
How's the day treating you?

831
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:33,666
[stapler clatters]

832
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,875
You got something for me?

833
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:42,000
That's all of it.

834
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:45,791
Now, you leave this man alone.
You hear me?

835
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:49,583
This isn't everything.

836
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:52,666
There's the interest.

837
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,041
[tense music playing]

838
00:41:57,791 --> 00:41:59,791
I'm only fucking with you. Jog on.

839
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:01,333
[Seamus] A joke?

840
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:03,333
It wasn't fuckin' funny.

841
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:06,833
Seamus, uh...

842
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:10,458
[Frank grunts]

843
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:11,851
- [tense music builds]
- [gasping]

844
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:14,250
- There's... 20!
- [Frank yelps]

845
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:15,625
[panting, whimpers]

846
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:18,125
- Forty.
- [Frank shrieking]

847
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:20,458
- [Seamus] Sixty.
- [Frank grunting]

848
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:23,083
- [Seamus] Eighty.
- [Frank screaming]

849
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,875
[whimpering, groans]

850
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:27,916
- A hundred.
- [Frank screams]

851
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:31,250
- [screaming]
- That enough interest for ye?

852
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:34,041
[guttural wailing]

853
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:36,791
And if I ever have to
come back here again,

854
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:39,750
I'll staple so much money
to your fuckin' nuts,

855
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:42,833
you'll be pissing euros
out your dead limp dick.

856
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:44,166
[Frank groans in agony]

857
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,833
[crying]

858
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:48,125
Do you understand me?

859
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:54,083
[Seamus breathing agitatedly]

860
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:58,208
[breathing shakily]

861
00:42:58,291 --> 00:43:00,291
[trembling breathing slows]

862
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:10,625
I'm sorry you had to witness that.

863
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:13,208
[scoffs] No. It was... it was, um...

864
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:14,875
it was fine.

865
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:20,958
I used to have anger problems.

866
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,041
Oh yeah?

867
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:23,708
Hmm.

868
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:25,291
Hmm.

869
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:28,250
It's... been a strange day, hmm?

870
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:30,333
Yep.

871
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:32,916
[soft quivering breath]

872
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:37,166
How did they look?

873
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:41,916
Who?

874
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:43,958
Fiona and Malachy, like,

875
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:47,750

Fuck, Dove. Look, I-I know I said
to stay away from Seamus...

883
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:15,416
Oh, forget it.
The car in the bog's Power's.

884
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,333
What? W-Wait. How do you know that?

885
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:19,708
[clicks tongue, hesitates] Long story.

886
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,666
[sighs] I knew Seamus didn't do it.

887
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,000
Well, don't say anything
to Seamus about Power.

888
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:28,000
They might be in it together.
We don't know. We need to work this out.

889
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,083
- [softly] Yeah.
- Not a fuckin' word.

I need a favor, uh, for the podcast.

- [Emmy] Huh.
- Uh...

895
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:45,166
We're out of batteries.

896
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:50,875
What's up with her?

897
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:53,375
[Dove] She'll get over it.

898
00:44:58,083 --> 00:44:59,083

[crickets chirping]

900
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:19,375
Didn't expect to see you at my doorstep.

901
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:22,625
I... haven't not been thinking about you.

902
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:28,583
So you decided to woo me with red wine?

903
00:45:29,708 --> 00:45:32,583
After the <i>poitÃ­n...</i>
I thought we'd take it slow.

904
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:39,750
This is nice.

905
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,875
Not what I expected.

906
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:44,458
Most places are so stuffy

907

908
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:48,458
Why can't a funeral home be nice?

909
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:51,875
I, uh... I'd bring you upstairs
but the flat's a tip.

910
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:54,208
Have a seat. I'll, um, grab some glasses.

911
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:26,000
Be quick about it.

912

Look.

919
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:23,333
Look at that.

920
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:26,708
Six toes.

921
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:29,458
He hated that fuckin' toe.

922
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:30,833
When we were kids,

923
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:33,166
he paid me to chop it off.

924
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,583
[sniffles]

925
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:38,041
Mam caught me
just as I was raising the meat cleaver.

926
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:40,791
She was more worried about

927
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:43,083
blood on the carpet.

928
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:47,666
I used to...

929
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:56,000
I've done things
I'm not proud of, Gilbert.

930
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:58,916
[breath trembles]

931
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,166
I stole from the wrong people.

932
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:04,166
[sobs] Would ya look at him?

933
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,375
Did they hurt Mal?

934
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:11,875
Did they torture him?

935
00:48:13,416 --> 00:48:14,666
Kneecap him?

936
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,125
Did they touch her?

937
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:26,916
Was it quick?

938
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:30,333
Or did they drag it out?

939
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,250
[sighs]

"Disappeared."

943
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:47,541
"Disappeared," they said.

944
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:52,291
Well, I tried hard to imagine
they'd run off together. Yeah.

945
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:55,791
Australia. Canada. Costa Rica.

[sobs]

949
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:09,250
And every night, they'd laugh at me.

950
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:13,750
[inhales] And I'd be so fuckin' mad.

951
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:18,750
[sighs] Them laughin'
at the stupid old fuckin' fool.

952
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:23,208
Being mad made it easier,

953
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:25,916
but I knew.

954
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:33,791
Deep down,

955
00:49:35,666 --> 00:49:36,916
I knew the truth.

[melancholy music playing]

957
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,791
The McArdles took everything from me.

958
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:53,708
It was all my fault.

959

Something, uh, wrong?

Fiona wore partials.
