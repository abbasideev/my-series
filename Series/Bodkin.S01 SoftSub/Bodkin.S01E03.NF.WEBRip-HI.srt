<i>But aren't we all?</i>

5
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,291
<i>What lies on the other side?</i>

6
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:32,083
<i>Every death forces us
to look in the mirror,</i>

7
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,375
<i>to think about our own demise.</i>

8
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,208
<i>That's why we need ritual,</i>

9
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,958
<i>something which allows the living
to move on,</i>

10
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,791
<i>letting us bury the secrets of the dead,</i>

11
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,041
<i>forever.</i>

12
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,708
<i>But secrets are a funny thing.</i>

13
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:52,041
<i>They have a way
of clawing their way back to the surface.</i>

[music fades out]

16
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,958
Think his family will mind us being there?
We hardly knew Darragh.

17
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,125
It's not a funeral, Sizergh. It's a wake.

18
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,541
Knowing the deceased isn't necessary.

19
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,125
Getting smashed in their honor is.

20
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:22,291
Ah, it's good craic. I've been to wakes
where I barely even knew 'em.

21
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,996
- [Seamus] No respect for the dead.
- [brakes squeal]

22
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,416
No respect for the dead.
I'll fuckin' kill him.

23
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,250
I'll fuckin' kill him.

24
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,916
No! Are you fucking stoned?
What the hell are you doin'?

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,583
You come back from California
with your slimy tech...

26
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,291
- What the hell?
- [Seamus]...and you think you own the town?

27
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,375
Take a look at the state of the place!

28
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,291
- I can't believe this, Fintan.
- [Sean pants]

29
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:44,333
Dead Darragh isn't even cold yet,

30
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,916
and here ya are,
settin' out your wares for a party.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,250
Is he okay?

32
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,666
[grunts] Have you no respect?

33
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,666
A man is dead,
and you're preparing some cheap disco.

34
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,375
Darragh gave this festival his blessing.

35
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,851
- [mutters]
- And a signed contract.

36
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,833
Unlike some people, he could see
what we're trying to do here.

37
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:03,083
To bring this town together
for something positive.

38
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,500
You lanky wanker.
I ought to rip your fuckin' tongue out.

39
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,083
Try it. I'll sue you
till you can't even afford to breathe.

40
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,666
[Sean] Seamus, relax.

41
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,666

[exhales sharply]

47
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,000
Bodkin is changing, Seamus.

48
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,375
The future's gonna happen,
whether you like it or not.

49
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,833
[children giggling]

50
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,583
Back to work now! Chop-chop!

51
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,041
You're right, Gilbert.

52
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,208
He is a really nice guy.

53
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,708
- [Gilbert sighs]
- [whimsical music plays]

54
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,833
Would you look at all this nonsense?

55
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,375
- It's a lot of fuss.
- [groans] No.

56
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,250
The last Samhain Festival
ended in disaster,

57
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,750
not to mention the vandalism

58
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,333
and wanton destruction of property
that took place.

59
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,375
As head of the Samhain Safety Committee,
I assumed your podcast

60
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,083
would be very interested
in hearing our perspective on it.

61
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,500
I'd rather listen to fuckin' paint dry.

62
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,625
[woman 1 sobs, blows nose]

63
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,166
[snivels] Thanks so much.

64
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,875
[spluttering] I just... So sorry.

65
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,041
Thanks for coming.
Make yourself a cuppa tea.

66
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,291
[wails, sobs]

67
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,375
Jaysus, the lungs on her.

68
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,125
- Who are they?
- Darragh's two sisters, down from Mayo.

69
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,250
Whole place is theirs now.
Looking to get a pretty penny for it.

70
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,166
[chuckles]

71
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,666
You sure it's okay
to just turn up like this?

72
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,916
- Darragh's family are in mourning.
- [Dove] Exactly.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,666
So they're throwing a three-day party
to cheer themselves up.

74
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,416
Besides... the Badger is in there.
He and I need to have a little chat.

75
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,375
[splutters] I'll talk to Seamus,
all right?

76
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,958
You'll just scare him off. All right?

77
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,934
For all we know, he's been living
a perfectly innocent life all this time.

78
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,041
[scoffs] Men like him don't change.

79
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,833
Think about it. I get run over.

80
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,666
Sean's car is set on fire.
And now Darragh's "accident."

81
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,208
- You really think he was murdered?
- Let's not jump to conclusions, all right?

82
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:01,583
Our job is to ask questions,
not to make wild assumptions.

83
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,375
[Emmy] Okay.

84
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,625
[whimsical music continues]

85
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,375
- Sorry for your loss. Sorry.
- Thank you.

86
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,875
- [woman 2 sobbing]
- [indistinct chatter]

87
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,833
Ah, how're ya, Bob?

88
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,750
[indistinct chatter]

89
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,791
[boy] Let's go! Let's go! Get your jacket!

90
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,666
Run! Run! Excuse me!
Coming through! Coming through!

91
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,500
[music fading out]

92
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,000
[woman 3] Do you like the makeup?
Did it myself.

93
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,096
What are you, the undertaker or something?

94
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,375
I am, actually.

95
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,416
Mary Donovan,
Donovan and Sons Funeral Home.

96
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:57,916
"Sons"?

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,583
My brothers were more squeamish
than anticipated.

98
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:02,791
And you are?

99
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:06,791
Dove. Uh... I'm curious,
was there an autopsy on Darragh's body?

100
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,875
You only carry out an autopsy
when the death is suspicious,

101
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,416
which Darragh's was not.

102
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,140
- Poor man just tripped and hit his head.
- How can you be so sure?

103
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,208
Angle of the fall, depth of the wound.

104
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,541
A blood alcohol level
that could strip paint.

105
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,666
On behalf of the family,

106
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,000
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to pay your respects.

107
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,625
[speaking in Irish]

108
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,958
[all, in English] Amen.

109
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,666
Hail Mary, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women.

110
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,583
And blessed be the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

111
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,041
[all] Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

112
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,458
now and at the hour of our death.

113
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,421
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

114
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,708
Blessed art thou amongst women,

115
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,583
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

116
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,083
[all] Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

117
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,486
now and at the hour of our death.

118
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,221
[priest] Hail Mary, the Lord is with thee.

119
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,541
Blessed art thou amongst women.
Blessed be the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

120
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,250
[all] Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

121
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,416
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

122
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,416
- [whispers] We should recor...
- [speaking in Irish]

123
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,416
[prayer continues in background]

124
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,250
[crowd continues praying indistinctly]

Egg and tuna in the one sandwich.

127
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:11,750
Bafflin'.

128
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,375
[inhales] Sad day.

129
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,458
Poor Darragh.

130
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,166
What was his second name?

131
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,000
[scoffs softly]

132
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,083
Thought so.

133
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,231
You ought to be ashamed of yourself,

134
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,916
picking over honest people's grief
like a vulture.

135
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:30,875
I'm a journalist.

136
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,833
[scoffs] Of course you are.

137
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,583
And I know it's fun for you city folk
to come down here and gawp at us.

138
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,375
But our lives aren't fodder
for your entertainment.

139
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,625
Well, you seem pretty interesting to me.

140
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,625
Well now, I might have
an interesting story for you.

141
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:47,833
Let's say

142
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,083
I work for the British government,

143
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,625
and I want to whistleblow

144
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,416
about a bunch of data breaches
in the healthcare system.

145
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,541
- So I tell my story to a journalist...
- [tense music drones]

146
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,166
...who promises me all sorts of anonymity,

147
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,541
but somehow, on the very day
said journalist publishes her story,

148
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,875
my name is leaked.

149
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,916
And my life is turned upside down.

150
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,291
Well, I just might end up killing meself.

151
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:19,000
All because of this journalist's
glaring incompetence. [chuckles]

152
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,666
[tense music continues]

153
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:26,250
You want to be careful gawping.
You never know who'll gawp back.

154
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,791
Mm!

155
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,833
Nice sausages, mind.

156
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,500
[country music plays over stereo]

157
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,583
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

158
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:44,000
[Cathal chuckles] The Rolling Stones
is the best band ever.

159
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,875
<i>Wild Horses.</i> Think about it.
<i>Wild Horses.</i> Doesn't get any better.

160
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,750
<i>- Paint It, Black.</i>
- You can't go wrong with the Stones.

161
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,583
[Cathal] I don't know why they try
to make new songs anymore.

162
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,041
[indistinct chatter]

163
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,083
[men laughing heartily]

164
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,416
You look very relaxed
for a man who's up to his ears in debt.

165
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,041
[nervously] Th-This isn't really the...
the time or... or the place to be...

166
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,791
[snorts] I'm fucking with you.

167
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,875
[chuckles] Relax. It's a party.

168
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,291
No money talk. [chuckles]

169
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,291
- What is she talking about?
- Uh, nothing. Nothing.

170
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,500
[splutters] Uh, so,

171
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,041
were you close with... with Darragh?

172
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,250
No, not really.

173
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,633
We had a few business dealings
over the years.

174
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,291
Okay, and was he, uh,
friends with Malachy?

175
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,416
Who?

176
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,458
Malachy, the guy
who disappeared on Samhain.

177
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,333
I didn't know him.

178
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,166
What about you?

179
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,166
What were you doing on Samhain?
Sounds like it was a pretty crazy night.

180
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,375
I wouldn't know.
I missed the entire thing.

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,375
I gave my pal Greta
a lift to Dublin that night,

182
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,500
but by the time I got back,
it was all over.

183
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,250
Yeah.

184
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,666
All right. I'm going in.

185
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,208
I'm gonna see what I can tease out
about Darragh and Malachy.

186
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,416
Great. I'll try to see
if I can find anything too.

187
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,375
All right.

188
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,583
[country music continues]

189
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,500
[Dove sighs deeply]

190
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,750
[under breath] Fuck's sake.

191
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,375
Can offer you a real drink,
if you're interested.

192
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,541
Homemade <i>poitÃ­n,</i>

193
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,833
guaranteed to change any mood.

194
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,250
For better or worse?

195
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,375
It's good stuff. I make it in the bathtub.

196
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,416
[scoffs] Yeah, I don't think going blind
will cheer me up.

197
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,666
Find your own drink, then,
if you're so chickenshit.

198
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,208
[coughs] Jesus fucking hell.

199
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,041
I age it with formaldehyde.

200
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,125
It adds character,
if you know what I mean.

201
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,791
- You...
- [laughs]

202
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,480
You're some easy mark, you know that?

203
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,541
That's the spirit.

204
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,750
[sighs]

205
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,885
Jesus. Why are the sexy ones
always so moody?

206
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,250
[coughs, splutters]

[chuckles softly]

211
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Uh...

212
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,208
That should do it.

213
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,583
He was as sweet as an angel, was Darragh.

214
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,583
Never a bad word for anyone.

215
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,583
[whimsical intriguing music playing]

216
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,041
I spent months trying to shift Darragh,

217
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,541
but he said that he wanted to wait
until he was married,

218
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,000
so I married Tommy here.

219
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,500
Now, with Tommy,
I had the opposite problem.

220
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,166
He's like a rabbit.

221
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,223
[priest] <i>Darragh used to be quite devout,</i>

222
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,541
but he never attended Mass again
after his spell away.

223
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,583
I thought he never left the farm.

224
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,125
[chuckles] Well, it's...
it's a long time ago now.

225
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,166
Do you know where he went?

226
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,083
You know yourself,

227
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,208
a nod is as good as a wink
to a blind man, huh?

228
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,708
Is that Edna O'Shea I see there?

229
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,208
You're kinda interesting, aren't you?

230
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,500
[amused scoff] I've been called worse.

231
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,416
Yeah, I bet.

232
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,250
[inhales] Trade you one for one.

233
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,500
All right. You go first.

234
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,291
[inhales deeply]

235
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,250
[clears throat, sighs]

236
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,666
[clicks tongue]

237
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,250
I traded Bodkin for London.

238
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,791
Small town, big dreams.

239
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,125
Fell in love, fell out of love. [chuckles]

240
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,809
Turns out, I am better
at handling dead ones than live ones,

241
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:54,875
so I came home.

242
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,208
We have plenty of dead ones in London.

243
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,750
Yeah, but not so many wakes.

244
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,041
Where would I meet anyone new?

245
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,333
[Dove chuckles softly]

246
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,791
[Mary chuckles softly]

247
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,101
You know, normally,
people who take themselves so seriously

248
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,125
are kind of a pain in the ass,
but on you, it is kind of cute.

249
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,625
[tender music plays]

250
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:14,916
[scoffing chuckle]

251
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You're drunk.

252
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,666
Yeah, well, I'd want to be.

253
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,375
This stuff is about 90% proof.

254
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,208
Can we cut to the chase?

255
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,155

- I wa...

257
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,250
Excuse me.

258
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,083
Damien.

259
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,000
- Bye, then.
- [door opens]

260
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,541
He's the fuckin' Badger, Damien.

261
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,166
An infamous smuggler,
missing-slash-presumed dead,

262
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,000
living all this time
down in bloody Bodkin.

263
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,291
- This could be huge.
- [Damien] <i>Stop. Stop.</i>

264
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,101
Wha... I haven't even told you
the best bit...

265
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,500
[Damien] <i>I mean it. Stop. Breathe.</i>

266
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,125
Don't tell me to breathe, Damien.
I'm always fuckin' breathing.

267
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,166
[Damien] <i>They got a warrant
to search your flat.</i>

268
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,583

269
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,458
<i>Now the Home Office think
that you stole it.</i>

270
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:08,000
<i>They are launching
a formal investigation against you.</i>

271
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,708
- [unsettling music plays]
- That's bullshit. I didn't steal it.

272
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,631
He asked me to mind it.
It's standard practice.

273
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,416
[Damien] <i>No, Dove, it's not.
It's government property.</i>

274
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,916
The guy was scared shitless.
He came to me for help.

275
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,041
What was I supposed to do?

276
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,500
[Damien] <i>You were supposed to tell me
so this wouldn't hit me like a train!</i>

277
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,416
Damien, you know this is bullshit.

278
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,041
Th-They're punishing me
for breaking the story.

279
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,291
I mean, they're the ones
that fucking leaked his name.

280
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,125
[Damien] <i>I think you need to come home.</i>

281
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,416
[breathes nervously]
Oh, now you want me home?

282
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,666
I find a story here, an actual story,
and you want me home to defend myself

283
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,958
against faceless bureaucrats
who've got their knickers in a twist?

284
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,083
No, not a chance.

285
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,125
[Damien] <i>Dove... it's serious.</i>

286
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,291
Yeah, of course it's fuckin' serious,
so I need you to step up, vouch for me.

287
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,666
Tell them I mentioned it to you
at the time.

288
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,208
[Damien] <i>Lie for you, you mean?</i>

289
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,333
- You're meant to protect me, Damien.
- [Damien sighs]

290
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,833
<i>You really think there's a story
in this Badger thing?</i>

291
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,125
100%.

292
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:05,083
[Damien] <i>Keep on it, then.
I'll see what I can do from here.</i> [sighs]

Well as you can know anyone, I suppose.

307
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,083
It seems like he was a good man.

308
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,375
Yeah, he was.

Good friend.

00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,291

Yep. Can't argue with you there.

Eh... Yeah, sometimes. You'd be surprised.

341
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,333
Nobody knows what I've been through.
I... I don't belong here.

342
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,958
Do you know what I mean?

343
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,583
I actually do, yeah.

344
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,000
If you fancy,
we can jump in the back of my car

345
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:17,916
and search together?

346
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,375
Jesus. Sean!

347
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,041
- [gate clangs]
- Oh.

348
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,416
Hey, I was jokin'.

349
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,208
It was a joke, obviously.
We... we can jump in the front.

350
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,541
[Emmy] Dove, what are you doing?

351
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,625
My job.

352
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,708
[huffs]

353
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:34,833
[huffs]

354
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,750
Shall I come with you?

355
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
No.

356
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,875
[scooter whirs]

357
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,666
[Emmy sighs]

358
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,583
[country music playing]

359
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,000
Having fun, pet?

360
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,083
Loads.

361
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,708
[inaudible]

362
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,125
Wasn't sure how much milk you took.
I hope it's okay.

363
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,583
[woman] No, that's perfect.

364
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,791
I'd murder a cuppa tea.

365
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:04,833
Excuse me.

366
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,166
Hi there. I'm Emmy.

367
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,226
I just wondered
if I could talk to you about the...

368
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,458
So this podcast of yours,
it's about Samhain, right?

369
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,375
The disappearances?

370
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,208
Yes, but it's about the town too.

371
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,833
We wanna talk with people,
see where the story takes us.

372
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,076
Good luck getting any sense
out of anyone in this town.

373
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,833
[cell phone chiming, beeps]

374
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,916
Claire, where are you?
Have you heard from the PA guys?

375
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,791
Fleetwood Mac are bog-standard,
Top 40 shite.

376
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,666
That's what your taste in music is, shite.

377
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,375
And they should be flushed down the toilet
where they belong.

378
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,666
You should flush yourself down after them.
You're full of it, shite.

379
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,000
[Barry] Here. Hold that.

380
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,250
- Do you want one of these?
- [Cathal] No, go on.

381
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,541
- Drink?
- [Cathal] I don't wanna hear another word.

382
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,125
You lovely man.

383
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:49,333
You know, so many people have said
such kind things about Darragh.

384
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,208
Thank you.

385
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,916
You know, it-it-it's funny,

386
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,625
because he told me
that he never left this place,

387
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:00,416
but then I was hearing about a time
that he <i>did</i> leave town?

388
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,333
[softly] Oh.

389
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,416
[hesitates]

390
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,625
We should have a word.

391
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,666
- In private.
- [Gilbert] Of course.

392
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,416
Sorry if I was rude earlier.

393
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,375
Sometimes this place makes me so mad,
I forget why I came back.

394
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,791
[country music continues]

395
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,833
I imagine Bodkin's a bit
of a culture shock for you.

396
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,416
You don't know anything about me.

397
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,916
Hello. I'm Fintan.

398
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,791
Sorry for being a dick just then.

399
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,958
You seem cool and interesting,
and I'd like to talk to you.

400
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,375
And hopefully,
we can have a full conversation

401
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,500
before you realize
how painfully socially awkward I am.

402
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,500
Tsk. Good pivot.

403
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,875
That's the first law of tech,
interpret the data and adapt.

404
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
[Emmy] Tsk.

405
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:55,875
Nicely done.

406
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,750
[whimsical music playing]

407
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,000
[music fades out]

408
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,958
Like, you have your ups
and downs with family,

409
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,625
but... at the end of the day,
they're your own flesh and blood.

410
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,291
You don't want anyone
to be thinking ill of them.

411
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,375
Yeah, of course.

412
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,583
I mean, we wouldn't want
to upset either you or your sister

413
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,083
in-in your hour of grief.

414
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,416
The last thing the family wants

415
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,833
is for Darragh to be remembered
for his mistakes.

416
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,041
Yeah, uh, of course.

417
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,625
No point dragging it over the coals now.

418
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,125
[sobs] Thank you.

419
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:36,625
I mean, we were mortified
when he was sent to prison.

420
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,666
But then he comes back
with that boy Malachy in tow.

421
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,041
Nothing was ever the same again.

422
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,708
Yeah, Darragh and... and Malachy
met... met in prison.

423
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,333
Yeah.

424
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,250
I could never understand it.

425
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,208
[inhales shakily]

426
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,958
Darragh thought the world of him.

427
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,750
He was heartbroken
when Malachy disappeared.

428
00:19:56,291 --> 00:20:00,125
I tried to comfort him,
but... he never really listened to me.

429
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,916
Sure, he always confided in Alice.

430
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,833
[sighs] Oh, but I loved him so much.

431
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,416
Course you did.

432
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,333
- [sobs] I did. I loved him.
- Course.

433
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,583
[crying]

434
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,500
- [intriguing music playing]
- [electric scooter whirring]

435
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,625
[locked door rattling]

436
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,083
[music continues]

437
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,791
[locked door rattling]

438
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,750
[breathes heavily]

439
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,083
In for a penny... [grunts]

440
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,875
So what do you remember of Samhain?

441
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,416
- [country music playing]
- [Fintan sighs softly]

442
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
I, uh...

443
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,541
I saw Jackie Lantern.

444
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,166
Who?

445
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,625
He's this mythic blacksmith who's doomed
to wander the earth for eternity.

446
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,588
When we were kids, we'd dare each other
to go to the bog lake on Samhain,

447
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,541
because that's where
Jackie Lantern turns up.

448
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,166
And?

449
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,541
Well... can I be honest?

450
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,833
I was 14 at the time,

451
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,916
and, uh, I'd recently discovered
magic mushrooms.

452
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,333
And I was trying to show off to a girl,
so I took shrooms, ended up there.

453
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:40,958
And you saw him?

454
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,041
Oh yeah.

455
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:47,666
I saw a huge, hulking, hideous monster
emerging from the bog on Samhain.

456
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,333
- You're making this up.
- I'm not.

457
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,125
I swear.

458
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,416
[Emmy chuckles softly]

459
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:58,791
Nice view.

460
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,791
All I see is shit.

461
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,250
Fields and fields of shit.

462
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,375
Besides, every second here

463
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,041
is another moment away
from my poor sick Maurice.

464
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,791
He has the cancer, you know.

465
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,708
How long have you been married?

466
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:18,833
Maurice is my cat.

467
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,250
No one understands, do they?

468
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,458
You know, how much our cats mean to us.

469
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,166
Do you have a cat?

470
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,416
Oh yeah.

471
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,125
[chuckles] Two.

472
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,416
What breed are they?

473
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,625
You know, they're, uh...

474
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:41,166
Strays is the best way to... describe it.

475
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,333
I got them from a rescue.

476
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:44,416
[inhales deeply]

477
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,708
- Good man.
- [chuckles softly]

478
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,333
[breathy mutter]

479
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:56,666
So Dot mentioned how heartbroken
Darragh was when Malachy went missing.

480
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,083
They must have been great friends.

481
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,375
"Friends"?

482
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,666
That's one word for it, I suppose.

483
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:04,958
What do you mean?

484
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:06,375
Don't be daft.

485
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:09,000
Poor Darragh obviously dug
with the other foot.

486
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,125
[softly] Oh.

487
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,625
W... Were they together?

488
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:14,708
Hardly.

489
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,916
Malachy never seemed
to return my brother's feelings,

490
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,791
but he did exploit them.

491
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:22,375
Malachy kept Darragh on a short leash.

492
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:25,541
Made him rent that land to him
for years for next to nothing.

493
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:29,625
Everyone could see it but Darragh,
the great big eejit.

494
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,125
Then Malachy disappeared.

495
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:35,041
And his brother just waltzed into town,
took over the lease at the same rate.

496
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,000
[inhales deeply]

497
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:39,625
He let those two good-for-nothing brothers
just take advantage of him.

498
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,208
So Malachy had a brother?

499
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,541
Of course.

500
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,250
Weren't you talking to him earlier?
It's Seamus Gallagher.

501
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,416
- Oh.
- [somber intriguing music playing]

502
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,166
[sighs softly]

503
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,958
[suspenseful music playing]

504
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,208
[mechanism clacks]

505
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,291
[clack]

506
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:43,416
And then the devil gave Jackie
a hot coal in a turnip.

507
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,791
It's why you carve pumpkins on Halloween.

508
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,226
You'd think the Devil would give you
something more useful...

509
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,833
[chuckles]...like a car.

510
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:51,708
[country music playing]

511
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:55,250
[inhales] Um, so, what did he look like?

512
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,291
- Who?
- Jackie Lantern.

513
00:24:57,791 --> 00:24:58,791
Oh.

514
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,666
Very big.

515
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,250
Very frightening.

516
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,791
Only the bravest of boys can look at him.

517
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:09,208
- And that's you, is it?
- It's a blessing and a curse.

518
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,541
You know, I... I haven't thought
about that night in so long. God, I...

519
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:16,708
I think there was some sort
of a car crash that night too.

520
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:17,791
Where?

521
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,666
I didn't, uh... see it.

522
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,000
I... I... I just heard this screeching
and... and then a huge crash,

523
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:29,291
and then this bloodcurdling scream
over near the Casement Road.

524
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:33,333
But when I finally got over there,
there was no sign of a crash at all.

525
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:35,291
Nothing.

526
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:38,000
But that's when I saw Jackie,

527
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:41,791
out in the distance,
coming out of the bog lake.

528
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,208
What did Jackie do?

529
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Honestly,

530
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:47,791
I don't know.

531
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,166
I ran away.

532
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:53,125
But only for very impressive
and manly reasons.

533
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:55,125
[chuckles] So brave.

534
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:56,583
The bravest.

535
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:58,208
[both chuckle]

536
00:25:58,291 --> 00:25:59,750

[exhales]

539
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:22,375
Yeah, Gilbert,

540
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,125
such a nice guy.

541
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:30,750
Then you hear some tech bro's in town,
and you imagine someone, um...

542
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:31,750
Someone...

543
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:34,333
[hesitates] A bit cooler than you.

544
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:36,458
[both chuckle]

545
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:39,041
- You're mean.
- Mm, I'm just interpreting the data.

546
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:41,541
- Hey, have you seen Dove?
- She left.

547
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:42,500
Left for where?

548
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:45,916
Incredible as it is to believe,
she didn't talk through her plans with me.

549
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,666
Do you mind? [exhales]

550
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,750
Thank you.

551
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,208
Um... uh, but listen,

552
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,208
you have to hear this, okay?

553
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:56,291
Fintan saw something
on the night of Samhain.

554
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:57,291
Saw what?

555
00:26:57,375 --> 00:27:00,208
He heard a car crash outside of town
and a scream,

556
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:03,750
<i>then</i> saw a mythical blacksmith
from Irish folklore coming out of a bog.

557
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:06,625
Okay, well, get it on tape.
Maybe it'll add to the general mood.

558
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,791
Y... You said you wanted folktales.

559
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:10,875
Yeah, uh, text me if you see Dove.

560
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:14,625
[irritated huff]

561
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:19,291
- All good?
- Mm-hmm. [chuckles softly]

562
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,500
Just a thought.
You want a change of scenery?

563
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:24,500
Um...

564
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,250
You need to ask permission?

565
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:29,291
No. [chuckles awkwardly]

566
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:30,375
Let's go.

Right, lads... I don't need to tell you
how important it is to protect the goods.

Yeah?

00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:54,833
[Sean] Hup.

Fuck off.

Wha...

592
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:36,375
- Seamus and Malachy were brothers?
- Yes.

593
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:40,333
Okay, but why would they come here
and rent Darragh's land?

594
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:42,583
Well, the coastline
is incredibly difficult to police.

595
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:44,416
It's a perfect haven for smugglers.

596
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,375
We're onto something, Gilbert,
I'm telling you.

597
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,791
So, what does it mean
that Seamus wanted to marry Fiona?

598
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,125
It's Shakespeare.

599
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:54,583
Two brothers smuggling drugs,
fighting for control of their empire.

600
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:58,833
Malachy steals Seamus's fiancÃ©e,
so Seamus kills both of them.

601
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:01,416
Okay, but what about Teddy?
Why'd he go missing?

602
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,458
I don't know. He was probably
wanking in the woods for three days.

603
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:05,625
Teenage boys are gross.

604
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:06,791
Hmm.

605
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:08,916
"Smuggler murders family."

606
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:10,583
That's the story.

607
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:14,166
Slainte.

608
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:20,351
- The entire thing will be 100% renewable.
- [sensual music playing]

609
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:23,375
A vertical farm, 250 well-paying jobs.

610
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:26,041
You trying to sell this to me?
'Cause I'm convinced.

611
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:27,875
I'm just excited.

612
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:30,416
The server farm I'm building now
is just the beginning.

613
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,708
And we can expand into wind farms,
geothermal, housing, infrastructure.

614
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:38,041
Bodkin 2.0.

615
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,541
Curious much?

00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,541
[chuckles softly]

617
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:45,708
These are Teddy's, right?

618
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:47,875
Yeah.

619
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,791
Are you a fan of his work?

620
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:51,500
In a way.

621
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:55,000
He was a friend.

622
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:56,833
A good friend.

623
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:01,791
- Was?
- He and I, we, uh... had a sort of a rift.

624
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:05,125
Long time ago.
I'm just trying to help him out.

625
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:06,416
Why would you do that?

626
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:09,625
The night he disappeared, I, uh...

627
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:12,333
I was supposed to meet him,

628
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:14,416
but I ditched him
for the sake of that girl.

629
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,583
[inhales shakily]

630
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:17,291
He used to be such a smart guy.

631
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:18,916
Smarter than me.

632
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
Funny.

633
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:25,375
But after he disappeared that Samhain,
he was... different.

634
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Quiet.

635
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,750
Dark.

636
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,750
You feel guilty?

637
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,291
I suppose I keep thinking
if I'd met him as planned,

638
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:38,458
then maybe he'd be okay.

639
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,833
I always struggled to fit in, you know?

640
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:45,750
I was one of those kids who always
seemed to be the butt of the joke.

641
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:48,166
Is that why Seamus called you "shitpants"?

642
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:50,708
[clears throat shakily]

643
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:55,041
When I was ten,
I shat my pants during a school play.

644
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,458
Been my nickname ever since.

645
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,625
Say what you like about Bodkin,
we're a literal people.

646
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:02,791
- [chuckles softly]
- [Fintan] But not Teddy.

647
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,083
He was always loyal.

648
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:10,726
He probably spent the whole night
waiting for me to turn up.

649
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,750
Hey. What would you have done?

650
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:14,875
[sensual music continues]

651
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,833
All the shit that happened that night

652
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:18,666
was so long ago.

653
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:22,333
Can we not let it go and move forward?

654
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:24,750
Just have a little fuckin' fun?

655
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,750
We can try.

656
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:27,916
[chuckles softly]

657
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,166
So,

658
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:35,250
are we doing this?

659
00:32:35,833 --> 00:32:37,375
- Doing what?
- Fun.

Dove, come dance!

665
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:03,750
No.

666
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:05,291
Dancing's a weakness.

667
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:09,041
Oh, sorry, I forgot
you're far too cool to dance.

668
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:12,250
Yeah, precisely.
You've read me very well, Gilbert.

669
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,041
You hate everything.

670
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:15,750
Slainte.

671
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:20,666
Come on. You must like something.
Wha... Tell me one thing you like.

672
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:22,625
Whiskey.

673
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:25,375
Whiskey's a thing. It's not a hobby.

674
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:28,125
Come on.
[splutters] Tell me what you like to do.

675
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:30,583
Gilbert, what you've just said
is blasphemy.

676
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:33,666
Whiskey is an Irishman's number one hobby.

677
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,875
[slurring] What do you like to do
when you're... you're not working?

678
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,625
I write poetry.

679
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,541
Long romantic epics

680
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:47,166
filled with lust
and desire and heartbreak.

681
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:48,833
Bullshit.

682
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:51,750
I don't know if you've realized this
about me yet, Gilbert,

683
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,541
but I'm kind of an arsehole.

684
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:55,833
No, I realized it
a long time ago. [laughs]

685
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:56,791
[both laugh]

686
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:58,000
- See?
- [mutters]

687
00:33:58,083 --> 00:33:59,875
This version of you,

688
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:04,416
wild Gilbert, it's way more fun
than that sunshiny Yank I first met.

689
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,958
I guess that's as close to a compliment
as I'm gonna get from you, so... boop.

690
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,333
[cheering, clapping]

691
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:20,875
Think it's time to get outta here!

692
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,500
[slurs] Wait. Get this.

693
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:29,333
- [muffled music continues]
- [both chuckling]

694
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:31,875
[both breathe heavily]

695
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:33,958
Just the fella I was looking for.

696
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:35,541
- Who's that?
- [Gilbert sighs]

697
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:37,375
The Yank here owes me money.

698
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:39,250
[amused scoff] He owes you shit.

699
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:41,666
He owes me 8,000 fucking euro.

700
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,250
Oh, is that a lot of money to you?

701
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,208
Look here, love...

702
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,583
[grunts, groans]

703
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:48,875
- [Frank snorting, sniffs]
- [Gilbert] Uh...

704
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:50,666
That's my nose, you crazy cunt.

705
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,458
[labored sniffing, grunting]

706
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:54,041
[Dove] Fuckin' run, Gilbert!

707
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,291
[groans]

708
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,458
- [Gilbert] Dove, wait!
- [Dove] Just keep going!

709
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,875
- [music fading out]
- [Gilbert sighs]

710
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:07,458
- [Dove laughing hysterically]
- Oh my God.

711
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:11,541
- Eight thousand euro?
- I know, I know. I can explain.

712
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:13,505
- [laughing] You fucking idiot.
- I can explain.

713
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:16,125
[slurring] I know. I know.
It wasn't my finest hour, all right?

714
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:18,434
- You've only been here for two minutes.
- [Gilbert] Yeah.

715
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:22,000
It was the first time in the pub, and I...
you know, I drank a little bit too much.

716
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:25,625
And then, I guess I just tried
too hard to ingratiate myself.

717
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,833
You give me so much shit
for bulldozing in.

718
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:31,017
- Then you go and lose eight grand...
- I know, I know.

719
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:33,001
- ...to a fucking hippie.
- I know, but... Dove...

720
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:35,059
- Dove, I'm in real trouble.
- [Dove catches breath]

721
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:37,541
All right? I've mortgaged my house.

722
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:39,833
And I've borrowed money, a ton of money,

723
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,250
just to keep my company going.

724
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:44,208
Well, Damien says you're the hit-maker.

725
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:46,875
No, one hit. I had one fucking hit.

726
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:49,934
- [melancholy ambient music playing]
- [Gilbert sighs]

727
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:53,250
And for a moment, it was like,
oh, everyone's listening to me, right?

728
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,708
And that's when I started the company,
and I threw every cent that I had in it.

729
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,625
But it's like everything after that

730
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:04,916
has hit the air
like a fucking lead balloon.

731
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,666
Just... pff!

732
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,166
[slurs] It's like
nobody's listening anymore.

733
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:14,291
[softly] Fuck.

734
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:22,625
[huffs]

735
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:27,500
What if I'm a one-hit wonder?

736
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:32,625
And it's not just... not just career.

737
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:35,500
You know, it's like
everything is falling apart.

738
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,208
Money, debt.

739
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:38,666
Things with my wife...

740
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,541
[softly]...are just... just not good.

741
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:43,458
But I can... I can fix everything.

742
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:46,333
All right? I can...
I can get back to where I belong.

743
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:48,375
I just need this one to work.

744
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:51,208
All right? I... I need your help.

745
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:55,208
I get it.

746
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,541
Everyone's out to get ya.

747
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:03,583
And you're just... trying to do your job.
You're trying to tell the fucking truth.

748
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,250
[slurring] They don't wanna hear it.
They never do.

749
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:11,833
So you do everything, fuckin'...

750
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:14,416
everything

751
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:17,250
to get the job done.

752
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:22,458
[tuts] No matter the consequences.

753
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:29,416
Are we talking about the same thing?

754
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,750
[melancholy music fades out]

755
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,458
I get it.

756
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:42,958
- [gulls calling]
- [birds squawking]

757
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,833
Mm. That looks delicious. Thank you.

758
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:53,666
And what'll <i>you</i> be having this morning?

759
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:57,833
[wearily] Tea. Just... tea.

760
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
[Gilbert] Mm!

761
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,375
How can you eat?

762
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:08,458
I started drinking a glass of water
between every pint of Guinness,

763
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:09,583
and it really helps.

764
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:10,666
You should try it.

765
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:14,208
- [groggily] Hmm.
- So, uh... what's our game plan?

766
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:16,375
Oh. Go back to bed?

767
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:18,125
Sleep forever?

768
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:20,875
- We have to go to Darragh's funeral.
- [Dove sighs]

769
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:24,291
[inhales sharply] I'd like
to dedicate my hangover to Darragh.

770
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:25,958
He'd want me to go back to bed.

771
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:27,458
[Gilbert chuckles softly]

772
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:31,208
No, but Seamus will be there,
and you'll need to talk to him.

773
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:34,791
Uh...

774
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,625
Look, I... I like the guy,

775
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:41,500
but if he really is the Badger,
isn't it dangerous to confront him?

776
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:44,041
Mm. Seamus is the key.

777
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:49,416
You want a big podcast,
catching him will deliver that in spades.

778
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:53,916
[Emmy exhales]

779
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:57,416
I hope I didn't worry you.

780
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:00,916
Well, I'm only just in, actually.

781
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:02,791
You missed a button.

782
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,125
[Emmy] Ugh.

783
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:12,833
[priest] Because God has chosen
to call our brother Darragh

784
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:14,375
from this life to himself,

785
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,791
we commit his body to the earth.

786
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:19,791
For we are dust,
and unto dust we shall return.

787
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,000
But the Lord Jesus Christ
shall change our mortal bodies

788
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:24,750
to be like himself in glory.

789
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:27,458
For he is risen,
the firstborn from the dead.

790
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:31,000
We commend our brother Darragh
to the Lord.

791
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:33,708
- Go on.
- So the Lord may embrace him in peace.

792
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:36,833
- And raise his body...
- Nothing worthwhile ever came easy.

793
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:43,750
For our brother Darragh,
let us pray to the Lord Jesus Christ,

794
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:46,500
who said,
"I am the resurrection and the life."

795
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:49,125
- "Whoever believes in me shall live..."
- Seamus, wait up.

796
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:51,041
"Whoever lives
and believes shall never die."

797
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:52,750
- Got a minute?
- For what?

798
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,541
I wondered if you wanted to talk.

799
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:58,166
Talk?

800
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:01,916
- You know... about Darragh.
- [Seamus scoffs]

801
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,142
[priest] Accept our prayers on behalf...

802
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:05,333
Do you get seasick?

803
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,541
[whimsical music playing]

804
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:12,041
[priest] So may your mercy
join him to the angels in heaven.

805
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:14,500
- We ask this to Christ our Lord.
- [all] Amen.

806
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,750
[speaking in Irish]

807
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:22,625
[indistinct chatter]

808
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:27,000
[woman, in English] Hello.

809
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:29,916
I saw you standing here,
and I thought it might be worth seeing

810
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,166
if you had reconsidered your interest
in our worthy cause.

811
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,333
No.

812
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:35,416
Let's go.

813
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:37,916
Sorry.

814
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:42,625
[woman] I know you must think
we're just small-town busybodies,

815
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:44,458
but our concerns are genuine.

816
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:46,583
We don't want history to repeat itself.

817
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:51,375
You might be more interested if you knew
what happened to Seamus that night.

818
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:52,791
Oh. Sorry.

819
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:54,875
What do you mean?

820
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,583
The statue of Saint Seamus,
in the grotto on Casement Road.

821
00:40:58,666 --> 00:40:59,666
Christ.

822
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,541
This is important.

823
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:05,583
At the last Samhain Festival,
a car crashed into poor Saint Seamus

824
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:07,333
and almost completely destroyed him.

825
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:10,000
That level of violence
is totally unacceptable.

826
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:12,750
[Emmy] Did you say car crash
on the Casement Road?

827
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:14,875
Isn't that
what I've been trying to tell you?

828
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:17,208
[Emmy] Dove, wait!

829
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:18,666
[intriguing music playing]

830
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:22,458
Fintan heard a car crash up there,

831
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:24,958
and then saw something,
someone walking out of a bog.

832
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:26,875
Maybe Malachy? Fiona?

833
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:28,375
[sighs]

834
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,541
Something happened up there that night.

835
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:34,625
- Where is this road?
- [music fades out]

836
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:40,041
[Seamus] You know, in Ireland,
it was considered bad luck

837
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:42,333
for a fisherman to learn how to swim.

838
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,375
That doesn't seem sensible.

839
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:46,166
Ah, well, it is and it isn't.

840
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:50,666
Y'know, maybe it seemed wrong
to tempt fate,

841
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:55,791
or... maybe there was no point
fighting the inevitable.

842
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,625
Darragh loved the sea.

843
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:03,500
Told me once he wanted to be cremated
and his ashes spread to the waves.

844
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:07,125
He hated the idea
of being trapped in a box.

845
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:09,958
His sisters buried him anyway.

846
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,833
Mad, isn't it, all the things
you think are so important?

847
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:15,666
The next thing you know,

848
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:17,500
you're in a box.

849
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,916
You ever, uh, lose anyone close?

850
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
[chuckles]

851
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:29,375
Haven't we all?

852
00:42:33,708 --> 00:42:36,416
The big thing for me was my wife.

853
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:38,541
It was cancer.

854
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:40,291
It was bad.

855
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:42,958
And then I took the most

856
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:48,250
intimate and the difficult parts
from the worst time in my married life

857
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:51,125
and I shared it with the <i>whole</i> world.

858
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:58,250
Never thought for a second that,
you know, how big it would become.

859
00:42:58,333 --> 00:42:59,333
How public.

860
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:04,375
People loved it, you know?

861
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:06,625
<i>True Love.</i>

862
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:09,541
I mean, everyone except my wife.

863
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:12,250
She beat the cancer.

864
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:13,875
Course she did.

865
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:17,458
But we can't quite seem
to beat what I did.

866
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:21,208
Well, people do
what they have to do to survive.

867
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,541
Maybe that's all you were doing,
surviving.

868
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,166
I did the opposite.

869
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:32,583
Tried to bury it, put it in the past.

870
00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:34,666
[somber ambient music playing]

871
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,500
Who, uh...

872
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:41,250
Who was it...

873
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:44,958
that... that you lost?

874
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:46,500
[unsettling music playing]

875
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:52,666
[smacks lips] Now, you lads seem
awful interested in my past, I notice.

876
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:55,125
Dove in particular.

877
00:43:55,208 --> 00:43:56,291
You know, it's...

878
00:43:57,041 --> 00:43:58,875
That's the way she is with everyone.

879
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:00,250
I did wonder if

880
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
you,

881
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:04,875
maybe, knew what she was fishing for?

882
00:44:15,708 --> 00:44:16,708
She...

883
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:19,708
She thinks you were
in a relationship with Fiona,

884
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:22,041
and that Malachy was your brother.

885
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:27,541
Does she, now?

886
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:35,000
Do you know what happened to them?

887
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:39,083
[Seamus scoffs]

888
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:44,083
I didn't mean to...

889
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:45,791
I know exactly what you meant.

890
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:50,208
I loved that woman
more than life itself. Huh?

891
00:44:50,916 --> 00:44:52,791
I saw my children in her eyes.

892
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:54,666
I would have moved heaven
and hell for her.

893
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:57,583
Malachy... [chuckles]

894
00:44:57,666 --> 00:44:58,916
Malachy was my rock.

895
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:01,833
[sighs softly]

896
00:45:01,916 --> 00:45:03,916
And then, one day, they were just gone.

897
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:06,416
Gone where?

898
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:11,791
[scoffs] Sometimes you have to
face the fact that some questions

899
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:14,291
shouldn't be answered.

900
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,333
So you hold onto
that lovely wife of yours, Gilbert...

901
00:45:20,416 --> 00:45:23,125
because there's some things
that are worse than death.

902
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:30,500
Purgatory's an Irish creation, after all.

903
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:38,125
[sniffs]

904
00:45:38,666 --> 00:45:39,916
Swim well, friend.

905
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:42,500
[mysterious music playing]

906
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,125
Look, the Casement Road
just dead-ends into...

907
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:50,750
into a bog?

908
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:53,916
Zoom in.

909
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:58,875
What does that look like to you?

910
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:00,791
A car?

911
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:03,791
We should call Gilbert.

912
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:07,267
- [music fades out]
- [flies buzzing]

913
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:09,000
[Gilbert] Maybe it's just a rock.

914
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:10,625
Shaped like a car?

915
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:12,583
Come on.

916
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:13,958
I don't see anything.

917
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:15,958
We've got two people who disappeared

918
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:18,083
and a mysterious car crash
on that same night.

919
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,625
You don't think it's connected?

920
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:21,416
Maybe. [mutters]

921
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:24,333
[Dove] One of us is gonna have to go in.

922
00:46:24,416 --> 00:46:26,875
- [flies buzzing]
- [water birds calling]

923
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,291
[frog croaks]

924
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,083
Okay.

925
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:33,041
[suspenseful music playing]

926
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:37,791
Dove, it's freezing.
And it's probably nothing.

927
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:43,791
[Gilbert inhales deeply, sighs]

928
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:47,291
[Dove softly] Ugh.

929
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:51,833
[grumbles]

930
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:53,958
[sighs]

931
00:46:58,041 --> 00:46:59,041
[huffs]

932
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:00,916
[breathes shakily]

933
00:47:01,416 --> 00:47:02,458
[hums]

934
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:09,208
- [exhales shakily]
- [muffled metallic clanking]

935
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:11,666
[gasps]

936
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:14,333
[muffled metallic clank]

937
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:16,416
[breathing heavily]

938
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:21,708
[dramatic music playing]

939
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:22,791
It's a car.

940
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,750
- Oh my God.
- Right here. I fuckin' knew it.

941
00:47:26,333 --> 00:47:28,333
[tractor engine rumbling]

942
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:31,166
[water sloshing]

943
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,250
[pulley cranking]

944
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:37,208
[metallic groan]

945
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:39,541
[Dove] Did you get anything from Seamus?

946
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:41,875
Look, he's not who you think he is.

947
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,541
You know, i-if he was the Badger,
he definitely isn't anymore.

948
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:48,166
He's just... just a man.

949
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,083
A really... A sad man.

950
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:51,791
[water sloshing]

951
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,833
[dull metallic groan]

952
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:07,166
You know, may... maybe be this podcast
isn't about all this crime stuff.

953
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,333
You know?

954
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:11,125
I mean, maybe it's a story about grief,

955
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:14,416
and a man who's dealing with losing
all the people he cares deepest about.

956
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,666
- Right?
- Wow, yeah. Great hook.

957
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,541
People are <i>really</i> gonna
wanna listen to that.

958
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:21,000
I think it sounds really interesting.

959
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:23,666
Ye can't just be goin' around
pulling things out of bogs.

960
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:25,583
There's official paperwork
needs filling out.

961
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:27,500
Folks, just stay back
at a safe distance now.

962
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:29,601
- Get back, lads. Go on home.
- [Cathal] Whose is it?

963
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:30,945
No, I don't know whose it is. No.

964
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,541
[indistinct muttering]

965
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:34,291
It's empty.

966
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:37,798
[Eoin] Right, she's empty.
Nothing to see here.

967
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:39,795
[splutters] Will you all just
go on home, please?

968
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,083
It was worth a shot.

969
00:48:41,166 --> 00:48:42,750
- I guess.
- [Gilbert] Hmm.

970
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:47,625

[Emmy gasps softly]

974
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:01,708
- Fuck me.
- Oh my God.

975
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:07,708
[Gilbert] <i>Two bodies locked together
for over 20 years in a bog.</i>

<i>It's a storyteller's dream.</i>

978
00:49:13,916 --> 00:49:16,000
<i>And I wish we'd never fucking found them.</i>
