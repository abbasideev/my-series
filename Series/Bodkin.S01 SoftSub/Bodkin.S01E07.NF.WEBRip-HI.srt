1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,083
[foreboding music playing]

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
[ramp clanks, whirring]

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,458
[Gilbert] <i>There's only one ending.</i>

4
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,000
[foreboding music continues]

5
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,125
[Gilbert] <i>Everyone dies.</i>

6
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:30,250
<i>- Maybe that's why we need stories.</i>
- [wheelchair rattling]

7
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>They make sense of the world,</i>

8
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,083
<i>comfort us...</i>

9
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,333
<i>protect us.</i>

10
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,875
<i>In the end, we're all just stories.</i>

11
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:45,083
<i>Stories we tell ourselves,
stories we tell each other.</i>

12
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,708
<i>It's what makes us human.</i>

13
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,583
So what happens when you discover

14
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:53,083
that the stories
you've been telling yourself

15
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,166
aren't really true?

16
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:57,333
I mean, what are we without our stories?

17
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:58,958
Who are we...

18
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:03,958
[Dove] That recorder's going up your hole
if you don't quit that shite, Gilbert.

19
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,041
Well, good morning.

20
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:06,791
[Dove sighs]

21
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,125
What's got you all fuckin'...

22
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,000
Tigger?

23
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:14,416
Oh, come on. We... we did it.
We solved the mystery.

24
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:18,041
Well, step back
while I turn a few cartwheels.

25
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,041
[Gilbert chuckles]

26
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,708
Maeve's confession came out crystal clear.

27
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,166
So all I need is
a little audio of the festival,

28
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,500
find a few red herrings to tag the eps.

29
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,916
But I can hear it, Dove. The whole thing.

30
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,291
Oh holy shit. Okay. Imagine this.

31
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,458
Teddy's sad song from the bar,

32
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:38,041
underscoring Maeve describing
how she caved his head in with the oar.

33
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,958
Ugh! It'll be awesome.

34
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,083
I'll enjoy listening to it in my cell.

35
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:45,166
Oh, come on.
I'm sure it won't come to prison.

36
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,708
I mean, didn't you say
they're just trying to scare you?

37
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,208
Did you know
my mother was a heroin addict?

38
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:55,416
Oh.

39
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,666
[Dove] I didn't put it together as a kid.

40
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,750
Suppose it's not the sort of thing
that comes up naturally.

41
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,515
"We'll write your letter to Santy Claus."

42
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:08,166
"But first, Mammy has to
pawn your pram for a fix

43
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,250
or she might claw her fuckin' skin off."

44
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:17,000
[inhales sharply] She told me
she was... hungry all the time.

45
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:24,125
I didn't know what she was on about.
I... I was like... "Me too, Mammy."

46
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,375
The nuns weren't any better.

47
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,958
"Oh, don't worry about your mammy."

48
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,708
"She's just gone on a little trip."

49
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,291
"She'll come back to get ya any day now."

50
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,541
My whole life, I was told stories.

51
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,125
I promised myself I'd be different.

52
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,625
- Dove...
- Krtek begged me to kill the story.

53
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,291
I told him I could protect his anonymity,

54
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,125
guarantee his safety.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,125
He was just hanging there.

56
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,041
Piss.

57
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,041
His tongue thick. His face all...

58
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,708
[hesitates] You found him?

59
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,375
And I was gonna call it in. I was. But...

60
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,208
- But?
- But his laptop was just sitting there.

61
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:20,791
Open, full of evidence of corruption
at the highest level of government.

62
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:21,875
So... [hesitates]

63
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
...I had to.

64
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,541
- You know, I had no choice. Otherwise...
- Had to what?

65
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,333
They would have hidden everything.

66
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,791
Everything I'd been working on.

67
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,625
But wh... what did you do?

68
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,125
[breathes shakily]

69
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,625
[softly] I took his laptop.

70
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,166
Left him hanging there to rot.

71
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,250
[gusting wind whistles]

72
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,875
All for the fuckin' truth.

73
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,375
Why would you do that?

74
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,250
[inhales]

75
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,125
Because I'm hungry, Gilbert.

76
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,166
I'm hungry all the time.

77
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
So

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,500
Krtek killed himself

79
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,250
because of you.

80
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,625
[somber music playing]

81
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,750
[softly] Because of me?

82
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,416
No.

83
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,125
No, I'm not the one
who fuckin' leaked his name.

84
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,541
Yeah, but he begged you to stop,
and you didn't.

85
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,625
Look, as journalists, we have to...

86
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,541
Journalist? You think you're a journalist?

87
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,916
Yeah, of course I think I'm a...

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,166
Waving that thing around in front
of local hicks isn't fucking journalism.

89
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,625
Oh, what? 'Cause I respect my audience?

90
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,583
I don't just use my sources,
dump 'em, and then leave 'em for dead?

91
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,208
But that's exactly what you do.

92
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,208
You crack 'em open.
You scoop out what you need.

93
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,375
All to create
another mawkish piece of content

94
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:47,416
that changes nothing,
contributes nothing, says nothing.

95
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,541
[scoffs]

96
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,375
[chuckling]

97
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,958
Oh, you're not a journalist, Gilbert.

98
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,250
You're a pornographer.

99
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,250
[cell door clacking]

100
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,541
Right, then. [exhales]

101
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,166
Mr. Power, you're free to go.

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,666
I'm guessing this is how
all your relationships end.

103
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,541
[somber music continues]

104
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,166
[door screeches, clangs]

105
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,250
[unsettling music plays]

106
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,166
[Emmy] <i>No, no. I need a solicitor
for an extradition case.</i>

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,809
Who the fuck do I need to call
if you're the...

108
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,625
- [loud crash]
- [Seamus] Where is he?

109
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,583
- [clattering]
- [tense music playing]

110
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,708
[Seamus] Where's fuckin' Sean?

111
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,583
Where's Sean?

112
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,250
He's not here.

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,541
Lie to me now, Edna,
and I'll not be responsible.

114
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,166
Don't you threaten me, you thug.

115
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,666
Sean has to return what he's stolen.

116
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,166
My boy is no thief.

117
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:00,291
Your boy is a fuckin' dead man
when I find him.

118
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:03,708
[door slams]

119
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,958
[porcelain shattering]

120
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:17,833
[Emmy exhales softly]

121
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,000
That bastard so much as touches Sean...

122
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,750
I... I'm sure Seamus's bark
is worse than his bite.

123
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:27,458
You're being very kind,
but you have no idea what's going on here.

124
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,291
[inhales apprehensively] Actually,

125
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,083
I think I do.

126
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,000
[unsettling music continues]

127
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,875
I know all about Sean.

128
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,916
Remember the good old days
when you guys would just run me over?

129
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,458
[Charles] You think this is a joke, Dove?

130
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,916
[soundscape muffles]

131
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,500
[muffled] We can just arrest Sean O'Shea.

132
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,000
- [unsettling music continues]
- [whispers echoing]

133
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:07,059
- [Charles] If Seamus really is leaving...
- [voice echoes] <i>Seamus Gallagher.</i>

134
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,267
[Annika] Gallagher will just
start again somewhere else.

135
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,476
- We need him at the deal.
- [Charles] If Seamus really...

136
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,541
...falls apart.

137
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,250
I can get you Seamus.

138
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:21,958
Why would you do that?

139
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,041
Quid pro quo.

140
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,750
Perhaps you never found me,
never took me in?

141
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,975
I mean, no one would hold it against ya.

142
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,708
And what would you do then?

143
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,875
That's my problem, not yours.

144
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,101
You're not here for me.
You're here for Seamus Gallagher, and...

145
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,805
[inhales deeply]...and I can deliver him.

146
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,375
[whimsical music playing]

147
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,916
We'll need some insurance.

148
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,416
- [buckle clacks]
- [monitor beeps]

149
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,291
That should do it.

150
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,416
[Emmy] You can trust me.

151
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,642
- I just wanna help.
- [crunch]

152
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,666
[Edna] What was that?

153
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,500
- What did I miss?
- [music fades out]

154
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,916
The only thing that Fiona cared about,

155
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,208
had me swear to her,

156
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,541
was that Seamus would never have
anything to do with her child.

157
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,666
They were her last words.

158
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,916
And I failed her.

159
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,708
- I've let her down.
- No, you haven't.

160
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,666
[Edna scoffs]

161
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,833
[inhales deeply]

162
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,375
[softly] I tried so hard.

163
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,166
Tried to scare you lot out of town.

164
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,000
You burnt Sean's car?

165
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,916
Only because I thought you poking around
in everything would lead to no good.

166
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,583
And I was right, wasn't I?

167
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:46,500
And then when that didn't work,
Maeve had the idea to torch Seamus's boat.

168
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,750
- Jeez. You've burnt a lot of things.
- We hoped it might put the wind up him.

169
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,625
But he's like a fuckin' cockroach.

170
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,458
We have to stop Sean,
knock some sense into the boy's head.

171
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,583
Will you talk to him?

172
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,250
M... Me?

173
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,833
His tracksuits do nothing to hide
the hard-on he gets when he sees you.

174
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,375
[Emmy, softly] Um...

175
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,750
Tell him to give Seamus back
his fuckin' eels. He'll listen to you.

176
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't...

177
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,333
I mean, I... I can't.

178
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,750
[Edna] He'll be at his little hideout
in Tullycross Woods.

179
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,250
I've watched the three of you,

180
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,583
and you are the only one
who can actually do anything.

181
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,291
[whimsical intriguing music playing]

182
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,625
[inhales deeply] I can do it.

183
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,458
And the two of you... promise me.

184
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Sean can never find out
that Seamus is his dad.

185
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,708
- Never.
- Promise.

186
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,375
You have my word.

[dog chomping]

194
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,291

Christ. Fuck are you after?

200
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,083
Seamus, hear me out.

201
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,508
There's some mutual backscratching
to be done.

202
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,500
Scratch me fuckin' eyes out, more like.

203

- Go on. Fuck off.
- [drawer slams]

204
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,666
Look, I have a proposal
that benefits everyone.

205
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,208
I'd sooner climb into bed with a viper
than deal with the likes of you.

206
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,208
[car approaching]

207
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,291

[car doors open]

209
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,250
It's them. The McArdles.

210
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,458
- The fuck are you doing?
- Let me in.

211
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,041
- Fuck off.
- I'll tell them you're in here.

212
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,083
You fuckin' wagon.

215
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,916
[Brónagh] You check down the back.
I'll do upstairs.

216
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,625
Looks like we missed him.

First good hard-on for ten years.

00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,333
Never mind Viagra.

222
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,958
There's nothin' bates the prospect
of puttin' a bullet

223
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,416
through some cunt's head.

224
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,041
Jon-Joe McArdle, you're one bad hooer.

235
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:15,666
He's gone.

236
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,458
Fresh skid marks in the shitter,
so he can't be far.

237
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,916
He had an American in tow in the shop.
Dopey fucker. Shouldn't be hard to find.

238
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,541
He'll lead us to Seamus.

255
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,958
[whispers] She seemed like a good dog.

256
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,875
[whispers] She was a loyal girl.

257
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,708
More loyal than I deserve.

258
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,708

[whispers] I can help you.

261
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,458

[tense music playing]

266
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,791
Listen, I can get you to Sean.

267
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,625
No, I'm done with it.

268
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,291
You... you'd want to think
about doing the same.

269
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,916
- You can sweep in, take the eels back...
- D'you hear me?

270
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,291
[breathes shakily]
That's the best I can hope for

271
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,291
unless I'm gone now, this second.

272
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,500
Huh?

273
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,833
What use are eels to a dead man?

274
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,416
They're going after Gilbert.

275
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,375
Well, Gilbert needs to run, and fast.

276
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,583
He'll die roaring if he doesn't.

277
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,708

[Gilbert] <i>And so secrets are revealed.</i>

290
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:10,958
The past returns to haunt the present
like a raging specter of vengeance.

291
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,916
- Who knew, when we first came to Bodkin...
- Gilbert?

[Dove panting]

293

[breathing heavily]

294
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,375
I guess you're here to apologize?

00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,458
[sighs]

296
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,166
Gilbert, I'm...

[sighs]

298
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,392
[inhales sharply] Okay, you...
you need to listen to me.

299
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,083
- The McArdles are...
- Sean is Fiona and Seamus's baby.

300
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,208
I mean, it's fuckin' dynamite, right?

301
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,851
I mean, think about it. Think about it.

302
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,708
The bodies, the smuggling,
the Romanian adoption, the cover-up.

303
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,166
It just keeps getting better.

304
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,500
I'll be able to sell the TV rights
before we even air. I... I'm back.

305
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,583
[chuckles]

306
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,541
The McArdles are in Bodkin.

307
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,750
So?

308
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,791
They're looking for you.

[Sean] Whoo!

312
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,375

[sighs]

314
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,083
Sean.

315
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:08,875
Sean!

316
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,666
- You need to give Seamus the eels back.
- [chuckles]

317
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,333
- Right, you are.
- He's gonna kill you.

318
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,226
- I saw him this morning...
- He's skipping town.

319
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,000
He's scared shitless
of whoever tried to bump him on his boat.

320
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,000
And now, all of this, all of this is mine.

321
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,000
- Romania, here I come.
- What the hell is in Romania?

322
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,625
[scoffs] Have you seen
the <i>beoirs</i> in Eastern Europe?

323
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,416
And with a bit of money in my pocket,
I'll be rolling in pussy.

324
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
Sean, do you even hear what you're saying?

325
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,750
- [music continues]
- [lyrics in Romanian]

326
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,416
[in English] Yeah, I do. Yeah.

327
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,958
And that... that's my ticket.

328
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,250
[sighs]

329
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,133
[Dove] They think
you can lead them to Seamus.

330
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,375
- [splutters] I don't know where he is.
- That won't stop them asking.

331
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,666
And they won't be gentle.

332
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,833
- What the fuck? What do I do?
- [Dove] I think...

333
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,708
I think you tell Seamus
that Sean's his son.

334
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,583
- What? How?
- It's the thing that will bring him back.

335
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,791
Why would we do that?

336
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,458
Seamus is running for his life.

337
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,041
And the McArdles won't stop chasing, ever.

338
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,041
- [Gilbert sighs]
- [Dove] But we can save him.

339
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:07,958
How?

340
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,583
You tell Seamus that Sean's his son.

341
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,458
Seamus heads straight
to the deal with Sean.

342
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,541
Interpol arrests him.

343
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,666
Seamus gets lifted,
and Sean's in the clear.

344
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,541
The McArdles won't even come close.

345
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,708
You'll have saved the day.

346
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,125
And your podcast
will have the perfect ending.

347
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,416
[huffs]

348
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Fuck.

349
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,666
Dove, I don't know.

350
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,791
I mean, Seamus is very angry at me.

351
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,416
All right? He... he has a gun.

352
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,708
He... he stapled Frank in the face.

353
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:37,875
[Dove inhales softly]

354
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,291
Why are we doing all this?

355
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,750
To tell a great story.

356
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:50,000
And you are this close
to the best fuckin' story ever.

357
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,166
Just needs one final push.
It needs a journalist.

358
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:57,958
A real journalist.

359
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,125
You said I was a pornographer.

360
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,666
[splutters] I was just angry, Gilbert.

361
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,541
I get angry with the people I like.

362
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:11,166
And the people I don't,
but... you know the difference.

363
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,875
I mean... if Seamus gets arrested,

364
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,458
basically saving his life.

365
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,416
[smacks lips, sighs]

372
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,333

- That should do it. [exhales]

[water splashes]

376
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,083
[Sean] Look at that.

377
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,041
They're just fish.

378
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:05,208
Tiny little fish.
I mean, you wouldn't even notice them.

379
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,041
But they're worth millions.

380
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,958
Sean, what are you doing?

381
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,041
Seriously.

382
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,333
D'you know eels leave home
the minute they're born?

383
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,583
They swim hundreds of miles to get here.

384
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,958
Just little babies,
all on their own, defying the odds.

385
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,250
They don't go home
till they're all grown up.

386
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:30,458
All I have to do... is hand these over
to the Yakuza and I can do the same.

387
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,958
They're not Yakuza. They're Interpol.
It's a sting. You'll go to prison.

388
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,625
Just making shit up now.

00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,000
Sean!

393
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,875
The future's waiting for me, Emmy.
Now, go on. Fuck off.

- Sean, it...

395
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,250
Sean won't listen.
He's on his way to sell the eels.

- I'm so...
- Where?

407
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,958
She's out there, on Inish Mac Tire.

408
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,750
What, she's a fuckin' nun?

409

Fiona's dead.

410

Don't be fuckin' with me now, Gilbert.

411
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,041
You're sure it's Fiona?

412
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,625
Buried on the island.
She died there 25 years ago.

413
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,916
She died in childbirth.

She had a boy. Your... your boy.

You're fuckin' joking. Sean?

426
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:45,041
Mrs. O'Shea, she raised him
and... and never told him the truth.

427
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,416
Well, w-why would she do that?

428
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,666
She faked his adoption from Romania.

- I know it's a lot to take in.

475

you're telling me that I'm your son?

Yeah. [chuckles]

Like fuck I am.
What, is that the best you can do?

479
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,041
No, no. It's true.

480
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:29,000
You were born on Inish Mac Tire.

481
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,000

You're my boy, Sean.
You're as Irish as Guinness.

- No. That's not true.

- I just want to hold ya.
- It's not true. It's not true.

491
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:56,458
Romania has a population of 20 million.

492

Our main exports are... are... are cars,
clothing, furniture, and textiles.

Sean.

495
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:09,583
Nadia Comăneci was the first gymnast
in fuckin' history...

496
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:11,625
- ...to score a ten at the Olympics.
- Sean.

497
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:15,416

is the heaviest building in the world.

- [breathing heavily]

499
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:19,333
I mean, they're just facts.

500
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:23,166
Yeah, and I know them,
because I am fucking Romanian!

501
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,625
You've never been
anywhere close to Romania.

502
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:27,791
You've never left this fuckin' town!

503
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:31,458
And if I'd known, I swear to ya...

504

I know who I am,

00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:41,916
what I am, and where I come from.

510
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,875
And not one piece of that
has anything to do with you,

511
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:48,375
you fucking cunt.

512
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:52,416
Now, you leave the boy be.

- [gun cocks]

516
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, buddy. Why don't we...

517
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:03,875
[grunts] What did I ever do to you?

518
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:06,250
What did I ever do to deserve <i>this?</i>

519
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,083
You lied to us, the both of us.

520
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,666
You stole all those years from us.

521
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,625
You never cared about Sean,
just as you never cared about Fiona.

522
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:15,708
She loved me.

523
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,000
Fiona didn't love you.

524
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:17,916
She loved me.

525
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,500
She was running in fear,

526
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:21,583
running from <i>you.</i>

527
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,250
[inhales] She fuckin' loved me!

528
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,416
- [gunshot]
- [Edna screams]

529
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,416
- [Sean murmurs in shock]
- [Edna] Oh my God!

530
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,375
- [Sean exhales shakily]
- [Edna] Jesus Christ!

531
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:29,708
[Emmy] Oh my God! Sean!

532
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:31,375
- Sean. Oh my God.
- [Edna] Sean!

533
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:32,458
[Sean panting]

534
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,583
- [Edna] Sean!
- [Emmy] We need to stop the bleeding.

535
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:37,291
- Have you got anything we can wrap it in?
- [Edna] It'll be okay.

536
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:40,000
- [Emmy] Oh my God.
- [Edna] You're all right. Look at me.

537
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:43,000
You're all right.
Sean, it's going to be okay. Oh Jesus.

538
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,083
Sean, your

539
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,333
thumb.

540
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,666
Seamus Gallagher!

541
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:52,375
You're under arrest.
You do not have to say anything.

542
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:55,468
- But it may harm your defense...
- Fuck off.

543
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:57,208
Come on. [mutters]

544
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:59,375
- [gun cocks]
- [Seamus] Stay back, ya cunts.

545
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:01,083
[Gilbert gasps]

546
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:03,250
Right, I'm fuckin' warning ya!

547
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,708
[dramatic music playing]

548
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,500
- Hey.
- [Charles] Let him go! Let him go!

549
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:09,833
Stay back, or else.

550
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:11,166
[gunshot]

551
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,875
[music intensifies]

552
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:14,333
[engine starts, revs]

553
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:15,791
[tires screech]

554
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:19,708
[both pant]

555
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:22,541
What did you do, Dove?
What did you fucking do?

556
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:26,291
[dramatic music continues]

557
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:28,916
[tires screech]

558
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,333
[tires screech]

559
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:34,416
[engine idling]

560
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
[Seamus] Fuck.

561
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,875
[music fading out]

562
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:40,583
[drums beating in distance]

563
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,541
[festival-goers whoop, laugh]

564
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:46,000
Fuckin' Samhain.

565
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:52,875
Get out.

566
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:54,978
- Get the fuck out.
- Okay, okay, okay.

567
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,875
- Seamus, come on. Calm down.
- Who else knew, huh?

568
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,375
Who else knew about Sean?

569
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:02,458
Seamus, come on.

570
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,541
[inhales sharply] This fuckin' town!

571
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:06,625
[cell phone chimes]

572
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:08,083
[Seamus breathes heavily]

573
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:13,833
Empty your pockets.

574
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:14,833
What?

575
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:15,916
Now!

576
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:18,916
[Gilbert breathes shakily]

577
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,125
It... it... t was just my... my phone.

578
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:22,888
- [foreboding music plays]
- The other one.

579
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:24,958
[drums beating in distance]

580
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,500
[Gilbert breathes shakily]

581
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,416
[Seamus inhales]

582
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,666
Did you get all that?

583
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:35,041
- Look... [sighs]
- Do you know what's in my pocket?

584
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,708
Do ya? [breath trembles]

585
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:40,541
It's me son's... fuckin' thumb!

586
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:42,125
[breathes nervously]

587
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:48,333
Now,

588
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:53,125
let's give your little podcast
the ending it deserves.

589
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:56,708
[Sean inhales deeply]

590
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:59,000
- [exhales]
- [indistinct chatter]

591
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,791
[Emmy] What, you made a deal? [chuckles]

592
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:02,958
With them?

593
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,583
[indistinct chatter over police radio]

594
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:08,583
- Get what you want, did you?
- Just stop.

595
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:10,625
Krtek just the appetizer.
Now Gilbert, Sean.

596
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:11,791
Gilbert will be fine.

597
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,750
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, he looked fuckin' fine.

598
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:15,513
Seamus wouldn't hurt him. They're friends.

599
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:16,666
[Emmy] You sure about that?

600
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,416
He's the infamous Badger.
The dangerous, evil Badger.

601
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,333
- Until you lure him out to save your skin.
- No, I didn't lure him...

602
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:25,666
'Cause you're not some noble,
high-minded investigative journalist.

603
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,625
You just do whatever you feel like
to get what you want.

604
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:31,875
But you were right, Dove.

605
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:33,958
You do tell the truth.

606
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:37,708
This whole time, you've been
telling us exactly who you are.

607
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:40,916
And I don't know
how you live with yourself.

608
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:45,791
[sniffs]

609
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,250
You're right.

610
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,500
I did use them.

611
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:01,625
[Dove breathes shakily]

612
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:02,750
[cell phone vibrates]

613
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:03,833
[Emmy sniffs]

614
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:08,798
Gilbert sent his location.
We need to help him.

615
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:10,000
I'd only make things worse.

616
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:13,541
Fucking hell. Dove, we don't have time
for you to feel sorry for yourself.

617
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:16,083
I'm sorry Krtek killed himself.

618
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:19,208
Sorry your mum was a dick, or whatever,
but it doesn't fucking matter.

619
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,625
What are you gonna do right now, Dove?

620
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,083
- What are you gonna do?
- [Annika] Well, Dove. [scoffs]

621
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:28,083
Instead of arresting Seamus,
we now have a shooting victim,

622
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:31,291
a hostage situation,
and a dangerous smuggler on the run.

623
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,575
You're going to the station
while we sort this mess out.

624
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:37,041
We've been setting
this entire operation up for <i>months.</i>

625
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:39,916
- And within a week, you've...
- Oh, fuck off.

626
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:45,000
You have to be the most incompetent
pair of fuckwits I have ever met.

627
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:47,041
Explain to me the ethics
of the deal with Dove.

628
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:50,000
- [Charles] Listen, kid...
- Sean had his fucking thumb shot off.

629
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,750
What you did is entrapment.
Is that standard Interpol policy?

630
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,708
We don't have to explain ourselves to you.

631
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:57,250
You don't know what it takes
to keep people like you safe.

632
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:01,750
This whole conversation
is on record, by the way.

633
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:06,416
Do you have any further comment
on your actions here in Bodkin?

634
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,750
Good.

635
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:12,791
Now jog on.

636
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:19,000
[Charles] Let's go find Seamus.

637
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,125
Were you really recording that?

638
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,083
No. I feel wild. [chuckles]

639
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:25,166
That was...

640
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,166
that was very cool, Sizergh.

641
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:31,250
[inhales deeply] Okay, erm...

642
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,000
[sniffs] Where's Gilbert?

643
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,166
- Ah.
- [phone unlocks]

644
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:38,125
They're heading to the festival.
But how are we supposed to get there?

645
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:39,416
I have an idea.

646
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,416
- [Emmy] What?
- Well, it... it involves stealing something.

647
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,500
There she is.

648
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:47,833
[electronic dance music playing loudly]

649
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:55,083
[crowd cheering]

650
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:57,541
[woman] Whoo!

651
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,625
I'm just living my life, huh,

652
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:05,166
no bother to anyone, and you turn up,
worming your way in with your questions.

653
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:08,166
Huh? Think you can turn up here
and bleed me dry?

654
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,333
[grunts] All for <i>your</i> story.

655
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:12,000
Well, not tonight, Gilbert.

656
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:14,125
Tonight <i>you</i> get to be the story.

657
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:17,875
- [bass thumping]
- [crowd cheering]

658
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:21,083
[brakes squeal, hiss]

659
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,458
[flames whoosh]

660
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:36,458
How the hell are we gonna
find him in all this?

661
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:38,791
- [crowd cheering]
- [Emmy sighs]

662
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:42,583
[squelching]

663
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:45,791
[muffled music continues]

664
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,208
[rock scraping]

665
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,708
[Gilbert] Look, I...
I wasn't trying to betray you.

666
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:52,791
[Seamus scoffs]

667
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,958
Look, I... I'll delete everything.

668
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:58,333
I'll... I'll... I'll... [hesitates, sighs]

669
00:32:58,416 --> 00:33:01,750
You know, I... I will never...
I'll never make a podcast again.

670
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:06,041
Why would you do that, now, Gilbert?

671
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:07,625
Hmm?

672
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,083
Why would you give away a story this good?

673
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,458
Think about it. You know?

674
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,500
A man comes to Bodkin

675
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:19,250
to investigate three people
who disappeared...

676
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:20,750
[shuffling]

677
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:21,833
[chuckles]

678
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:25,416
...and then goes missing himself.

679
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,916
- [sighs]
- [Seamus] I mean, it's...

680
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,416
it's too good a story.

681
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:35,791
[breathes heavily]

682
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:40,333
Maybe, one day, someone will come along
and try to work out what happened to you.

683
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:41,416
Hmm?

684
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,416
And then we'll see
how you feel about it, huh?

685
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,083
Seamus, please.

686
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,833
You're... you're not this person.

687
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:49,916
[bag zips]

688
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,666
I am what I am.

689
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,791
- [foreboding music plays]
- [Gilbert sighs]

690
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,916
[heavy crate scraping]

691
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:06,916
[Seamus exhales]

692
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:10,750
[breathing heavily]
