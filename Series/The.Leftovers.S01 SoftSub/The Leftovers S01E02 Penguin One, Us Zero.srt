1
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,847
My kid wants to quit soccer.
You think I should let him?

2
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,183
- Is he any good?
- Nobody quits what they're good at.

3
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,021
So, who the fuck is this asshole?

4
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,982
Wayne Henry Gilchrest, Jr.,
also known as "Holy Wayne."

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,150
- Messianic?
- Maybe.

6
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,068
He lost a kid on the 14th,

7
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,696
worked the colleges
and malls for a while.

8
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,656
Claims he can hug the pain
out of people.

9
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,783
Magic fucking hugs.

10
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,201
Yeah, the only catch is he needs

11
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,579
to charge his batteries
with teenage girls.

12
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,664
- Asian ones, apparently.
- Apparently.

13
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,125
We had him on eight counts
of statutory in Pennsylvania

14
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,918
but he went underground in April.

15
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,880
FBI got a tip that he set up shop
at a ranch in Nevada.

16
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,382
- FBI?
- Guy's got a pipeline to D.C.,

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,426
sells his hugs to senators, I guess.

18
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,928
Well, that would make him a threat
to national security.

19
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:57,973
If that's your assessment.

20
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,475
- Guns?
- Got a couple dozen guys

21
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,518
at the ranch.
Semi-pro, no explosives.

22
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,686
Civilians?

23
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,521
Followers are mostly
dumb college kids,

24
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,315
usually a couple on the ranch
running errands.

25
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,734
- He looking to get martyred?
- Looking to get laid.

26
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,249
Okay.
Let's get him.

27
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,876
Here we go!
Go, go, go!

28
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,551
We got clear.

29
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,513
Cease fire!

30
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,683
Don't do it! Come out here!

31
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,604
Hands up!

32
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,753
- Where is he?
- Where's Wayne? Look here.

33
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,548
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

34
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,799
Where's Wayne?

35
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,595
I got one! Do not move!

36
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:22,266
Do not run, you fucking cunt!
Stop!

37
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,810
Do not fucking move!

38
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,690
Hands.
Turn around.

39
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,362
Get on your fucking knees.

40
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,492
- Where's Wayne?
- I don't know.

41
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,619
- Where the fuck is he?
- I don't know. Please.

42
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,705
- I'll fucking kill you right now.
- Please. I don't--

43
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,082
- Where is he?
- Don't shoot! I didn't do anything!

44
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,751
- Are ready to die? Where is he?
- I don't know where's Wayne!

45
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,044
Please. Don't!

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,062
I'm sorry, but she's important.

47
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,784
Come on.
Come on, let's go, let's go.

48
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,286
This way.

49
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,998
It's okay.

50
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,434
Don't panic. I got you.
Come on. Okay, go ahead.

51
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,896
Go. Okay.

52
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,582
Hey. Mr. Garvey.

53
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,835
Mr. Garvey, wake up.

54
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,425
- Aimee.
- Hey.

55
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,764
Aimee, you--
You can't be in here.

56
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,390
Shh.

57
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,934
It's okay.

58
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,189
I need you to come with me.

59
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,733
Come on.

60
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,361
He wants you to see.

61
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,287
You have to be quiet
or you'll scare them.

62
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,184
Wh... What are you doing?

63
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,105
Shh. She's right over there.
Do you see her?

64
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,284
Hey, Chief, watch your feet.

65
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,625
Put it out, Paul.

66
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,752
Got a little out of control
but it'll go out.

67
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,462
Paul, put it out now!

68
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,631
Shit.

69
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,885
What the fuck, Paul?

70
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,348
- I told him not to do it here.
- Jesus, Ginnie, the heat's out.

71
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,685
- Close the goddamn door.
- Sorry. Give me that.

72
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,188
My brother's stuff.

73
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,107
Can't you just take it down
to the Goodwill?

74
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,695
So I can see some asshole wearing
his clothes at the A&P next week?

75
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,990
- Should I call 9-1-1?
- No. Do not call 9-1-1.

76
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,952
Next time, just put it in the attic.

77
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,413
I don't really want it in the attic.

78
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,373
You owe me a fence.

79
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,167
Fuck.

80
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,424
You burned his fence down.

81
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,677
Who wants French toast?

82
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,058
Has there been
any further contact?

83
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,731
Sorry. What?

84
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,693
Your ex-wife, Lauren.
Sorry. Laurie.

85
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,862
Have you and she
had any further contact?

86
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,073
- We're still married.
- Does she think you're married?

87
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,826
You're gonna have to ask her.

88
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,954
I get it, because she doesn't talk.

89
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,626
What's that for?

90
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,921
I work with a lot of kids.
They use it for aggression.

91
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,844
All right, so, this mystery man
who shot the deer...

92
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,429
No, he didn't shoot the deer.

93
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,141
- I thought--
- No, no, no. No one shot the deer.

94
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,684
The dogs killed the deer.

95
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,269
Uh....

96
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,563
Right, sorry.
So the mystery man--

97
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,066
Wait a minute. Why do you keep
calling him "the mystery man"?

98
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,612
- You didn't tell me his name.
- I don't know his name.

99
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,700
It says here the squad car--

100
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,079
Your colleagues arrived in response
to a report of gunshots

101
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,290
but there's no mention
of anyone there other than you,

102
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,000
and lots of dead dogs.

103
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,921
The guy got into his truck
and left before they got there.

104
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,006
So no one else saw him.

105
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,927
I fucking saw him.

106
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,536
Soup's on.
Get them while you can.

107
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,496
No pancakes in the big house.

108
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,980
Oh, Christ.
Fucking laundry again?

109
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,082
Good morning.

110
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,651
What?
You want me to cut it down?

111
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,157
I thought you were bringing me
out here to kill me or something.

112
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,899
Hey, Moonie.

113
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,777
Fuck you!

114
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,497
I know for a fact that Torres
won't take attendance.

115
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,834
- I can't. I have an exam.
- Chicken shit.

116
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:54,295
Good morning. Free of charge.
They are not who you think they are.

117
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,882
You're doing really important work.

118
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,678
Someone needs to tell
that dude about the Internet.

119
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,097
Save us a seat.
I'll go order.

120
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,809
- Sorry.
- Oh, no worries.

121
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,605
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

122
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,365
I may have fucked that barista,

123
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,075
so if he spit in your chai,
that's on me.

124
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,871
- What?
- Do you know who that is?

125
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,082
Nope.

126
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,752
Her name is Nora something.
She was at Heroes Day.

127
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,670
Her husband and her kids
all disappeared.

128
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,217
- There's a gun in her purse.
- No shit?

129
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,846
Yeah, like, a big one, too.
Not some bullshit lady gun.

130
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,682
She probably puts in her mouth
every night before bed

131
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,643
and says, "Just one more day."

132
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,063
No, she, like, puts wigs on

133
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,065
and uses it
to hold up liquor stores

134
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,275
so she can feel alive again.

135
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,402
Or maybe
she actually killed her family

136
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,197
and then just said they disappeared
while she secretly ate their bodies.

137
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,492
- That's fucked up.
- Yeah.

138
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,211
What the fuck?

139
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,589
I'm so sorry.

140
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:24,093
Oh, uh... No worries.
It's totally cool, Mrs. Durst.

141
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,929
- Let me get you another one.
- No, no, it's fine.

142
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,306
- I've got to be somewhere anyway.
- Sorry.

143
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,184
Bye.

144
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,652
What was that?

145
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,455
Shit.
She's gonna pop father nutballs.

146
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:16,145
- You want to follow her?
- And what?

147
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,982
- Come on, dude.
- What?

148
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,400
Hey! Big bones!

149
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:26,406
Top of the morning, ladies.
Y'all need a ride to school?

150
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,783
Only if you let me drive
your awesome Prius.

151
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,535
Hop on in, baby.

152
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,036
- You know how to turn it on, right?
- Yeah.

153
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,413
- Go.
- Quick. Close the door.

154
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,123
It's a hybrid.
Hit the power button.

155
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,000
- Do you have a driver's license?
- This is very confusing.

156
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,668
- Brake.
- You got to hit the--

157
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,545
Here we go.

158
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,733
Ow! Fuck.

159
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,860
Ow!

160
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,254
So what,
the tree's supposed to symbolize

161
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,714
my old life or something?

162
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,016
Can I have one?

163
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,189
You know, you guys are running
a pretty shitty cult

164
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,899
if you can't even join.

165
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,613
"Not a cult."

166
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,907
Then what is it?

167
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,246
I'm not doing this anymore.

168
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,127
Because I don't want to.

169
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:09,550
Why? Why? Because I've been
with you people for weeks

170
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,804
and all I've got is Ron
and pancakes

171
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,391
and fucking tree-chopping!
What the fuck?

172
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,978
I mean,
it's freezing and it's stupid.

173
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,563
It's fucking stupid.
That's why, okay?

174
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,851
Christine, wake up.
This is it.

175
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,481
Just stay in the car, okay?

176
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,734
Is it him?

177
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,988
Maybe this isn't the right place.
He should be here by now.

178
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,574
Are you calling him?

179
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,372
No.

180
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,084
Tom.

181
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,588
No, no, no. Hey, wait, wait.

182
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,467
Hey, it's Tom.
I'm not here. God bless.

183
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,095
Hey, Tommy, it's your daddy calling.

184
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,013
I saw you called, so...

185
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,223
Listen, I'm gonna leave
my phone on,

186
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,933
so call me whenever you can.

187
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,102
I love you.
Shit.

188
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,479
Hard to get him to talk to you,
right?

189
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,148
Maybe try with the texting.

190
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,441
My ten-year-old,
that's all she uses.

191
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,361
- Where are we on the truck?
- Huh?

192
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,488
Pickup truck I asked you
to find two weeks ago. Where are we?

193
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,241
Oh, yeah.

194
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,785
We put out a bolo but no hits.

195
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,205
Maybe if we had
a better description of the driver?

196
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,333
Big, bald asshole
shooting dogs somewhere.

197
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,793
Uh....

198
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,086
Want me to sit down
with a sketch artist?

199
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:36,966
No, it's just you're the only one
who saw him, so...

200
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,634
Dennis, do you think
I made this guy up?

201
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,471
This is the part where you say, "No,
Chief, that's fucking ridiculous."

202
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,433
Fine. No, Chief.
That's fucking ridiculous.

203
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,936
- Go find the truck.
- Yes, sir.

204
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,619
Patti.

205
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,914
You know the drill.

206
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,498
I have a signed warrant,

207
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,500
applicable in the case
of a missing person or persons

208
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,877
to enter these premises

209
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,045
and conduct a visual survey

210
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,339
and/or question
the occupants therein.

211
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,883
May I come in, please?

212
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,817
Morning, Mr. Jensen.
How are you?

213
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,486
Terrific.

214
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,739
Obligated to inform you
the missing persons investigation

215
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,074
related to you has been closed

216
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,660
and that your family has been
informed of your whereabouts.

217
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,497
You understand?

218
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,251
Yeah. I understand.

219
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,266
- Hi.
- Hi.

220
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,352
Did you hurt yourself?

221
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,731
Just some blisters.

222
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,734
You mind if I ask your name?

223
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,946
Meg.
Megan Abbott.

224
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,119
You here on your own free will,
Ms. Abbott?

225
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,704
Yes.

226
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,832
You need my help?

227
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,255
No.

228
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,343
Do you mind if we take a picture?

229
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,971
- A picture?
- Mm-hm.

230
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,724
- Have I done something wrong?
- No.

231
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,727
Okay.

232
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,646
- Dennis.
- Yeah, Chief?

233
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,814
Could...

234
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,705
Okay.

235
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,790
- We good?
- Yeah, it's a good one.

236
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,170
If you ever wanna talk...

237
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,798
...we have resources available
to you.

238
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,302
You can feel free to call me,
night or day.

239
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,055
Why don't you fucking mail it to me?

240
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,617
- Don't get too close.
- I know what I'm doing.

241
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,829
Uh...

242
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,248
We're missing first period.

243
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,624
Jill is never gonna fuck you

244
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,126
if you keep acting
like such a puss, dude.

245
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,460
Ow! What?

246
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,171
- Did I mix them up?
- Shut up.

247
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,469
Oh, yeah, here we go.

248
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,692
Why are we following her?

249
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,529
Because she's fucking dangerous.

250
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,496
- Mr. Patterson?
- Uh-huh.

251
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,166
We spoke on the phone last week.
I'm Nora Durst.

252
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,210
I'm here to give you and your wife
your departure benefit.

253
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,589
- I... Come in.
- Thank you.

254
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:35,473
This guy is in the pledge house now.
No idea where he came from.

255
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,892
"Brandon" might be an alias.

256
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,144
Wouldn't give us a last name.

257
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,107
Got her. Megan Abbott.
From here in town.

258
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,527
Fiancé reported a missing
couples weeks ago.

259
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,533
Ask him to come in.
I'll handle it.

260
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,498
Jesus. I never should have told you
to watch the fucking Wire.

261
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:03,918
Lucy.

262
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,463
Gentlemen, you mind giving
the Chief and I a moment?

263
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,841
Yeah.

264
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,553
Madam mayor.

265
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:23,229
Kevin, were you inside
a G.R. Residence earlier today?

266
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,855
I was serving
a missing persons warrant.

267
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,398
I do that every couple weeks.

268
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:30,027
Uh-huh, and would you say
the climate has changed somewhat

269
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,113
since you went over there drunk
and punched one of them in the face?

270
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,283
I think I punched him
in the stomach, actually.

271
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,535
Want a bagel?

272
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,954
Kevin, I'm trying to help you.

273
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,872
By forcing me to get cleared
by some dipshit

274
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,499
because I had a rough night?

275
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:48,045
"Rough night"?
You are aware that people like dogs?

276
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,047
- I like dogs.
- Then stop fucking shooting them

277
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,383
because that's something crazy
people do.

278
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,054
You wanna get cleared?

279
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,515
Then you tell that dipshit
what he needs to hear.

280
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,726
- What's that?
- It won't happen again.

281
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,354
Well, I can't say that
because I don't mean it.

282
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,857
They're not our dogs.
Not anymore.

283
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,277
What the fuck does that mean?

284
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:22,162
Kevin, I need you to stop pissing
on the G.R.S' front porch, okay?

285
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,416
Fine.
See if I can hold it.

286
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,090
I'm visiting tonight, so...

287
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,141
Tell him I said, "Hi".

288
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,920
Fuck.

289
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,855
You have to film us?

290
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,649
It's ridiculous, right?

291
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,401
I guess some people
were filling it out wrong.

292
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,320
That's why they're making us
conduct it verbally now.

293
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,322
How many questions is it?

294
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,659
Just over 150.
Too many, I know.

295
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,120
Do we have to answer everything
to get our check?

296
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,580
Just what you can.

297
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,169
Okay.

298
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,631
This is Nora Durst,
ID number 42ECN.

299
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,883
Today I will be conducting
a benefit release questionnaire

300
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:03,305
for case file 77123,
Charles Patterson, age 34 at T.O.E.

301
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,642
Present are Louis and Marie,
the parents of--

302
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,687
I can refer to him as "Charles,"
as "your son,"

303
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,397
- or as "the departed"?
- Charlie.

304
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,941
All right. Charlie.

305
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,945
I apologize in advance.

306
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,614
The questions can be strange
for some people.

307
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,990
Were you able to look them over?

308
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,992
- There was a link...
- Let's just get it over with.

309
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,536
Okay.

310
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,833
To your knowledge, did Charlie have
any food allergies?

311
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,960
We sent in his medical records.

312
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,212
I know, and I'm sorry.
I'm not given access to those.

313
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,005
No allergies.

314
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,382
Okay.

315
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,094
To your knowledge,
did Charlie ever travel to Brazil?

316
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,346
No.

317
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,349
To your knowledge,
did Charlie enjoy cooking?

318
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,059
No.

319
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,895
To your knowledge, did Charlie speak
more than one language?

320
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,441
My son had Down Syndrome.

321
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,152
I'm sorry.

322
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,365
I am. These questions,
they're f--

323
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,078
I want to sign off on your benefit.

324
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,289
I know this is hard.

325
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,417
Answer what you can
but I have to ask them.

326
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,837
All of them.

327
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,756
No.

328
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,634
He didn't speak
more than one language.

329
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,094
Okay.

330
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,436
To your knowledge, did Charlie have
more than 20 sexual partners?

331
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,942
Do you have any hand cream?

332
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,944
What?

333
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,283
Do you have any hand cream?

334
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,786
I'm a man.
Why would I have hand cream?

335
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:50,996
You're a man?

336
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,416
I'll bet she does.

337
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:01,173
But if you get caught,
you will be shot.

338
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,387
Oh, my God, guys.
Are you serious?

339
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,813
She's a really bad influence on you,
man.

340
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,279
Jesus, lady.

341
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,583
Oh, fuck yes.

342
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,092
Okay.

343
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,221
Jill, don't do it. Jill.

344
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,397
- Stop, stop, stop.
- Jill, stop it.

345
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,774
- Stop.
- Shut up.

346
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,735
- Go. My God.
- You stupid bitch!

347
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,112
Hit the power button.

348
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,364
My God.
Just turn on the car.

349
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,032
Just go. Just go.
She's right there. Just go.

350
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,076
She's right outside.

351
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,070
Chief, the fiancé is here.
Waiting in your office.

352
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,115
Oh, right, yeah. Thanks.

353
00:31:56,873 --> 00:32:00,083
Mr. Finnerty.
Kevin Garvey.

354
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,628
Thank you for coming in.
So sorry you had to wait.

355
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,755
- You can have a seat.
- Jesus.

356
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,842
You people leave me a voice-mail
regarding my fiancé...

357
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:10,928
...and when I call back,

358
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,512
nobody will tell me
if she's alive or dead.

359
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,391
- Megan's with the Guilty Remnant.
- What?

360
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,771
I'm assuming they've been following
Megan for some time now.

361
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,606
They usually target somebody
and then--

362
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,149
What do they want?

363
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,778
- That depends who you ask.
- I'm asking you.

364
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:34,451
Well, they say they want
to remind people of what happened.

365
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,038
But what do they want?
They want to recruit.

366
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,833
Look, the good news
is that right now,

367
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,002
Megan's in what we call
the pledge house.

368
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,630
It's like an orientation.

369
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,967
They don't have to wear white yet,
they can still talk.

370
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,304
I spoke to Megan today personally.

371
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,308
I've dealt
with a lot of these people.

372
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:03,313
I got a feeling that with Megan,
maybe she's still on the fence.

373
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,532
I think you could still convince her
to come home.

374
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,002
Why would I do that?

375
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,338
Sorry?

376
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,718
Why would I do that?

377
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,015
Because she needs you right now.

378
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:43,311
She? Needs?

379
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,447
I postponed my wedding
for three years

380
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,198
because of what she needs.

381
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,617
But she snuck off in the middle
of the fucking night

382
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,869
so she could be with them!

383
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,956
And she needs them!
The fucking ghosts!

384
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,462
What the fuck
are you talking about, man?

385
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,677
What the f....

386
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,485
- What, Dennis?
- Chief, I found the truck.

387
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:37,115
- Where?
- It's... in your driveway.

388
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:51,129
Hey. Saw it when I was driving by,
called you first thing.

389
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,893
- Keys are on the dash.
- Yeah, I noticed that.

390
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,561
Did you run the vin?

391
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,856
Uh-huh. No registration, no wants.

392
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,282
I looked inside.
It's a dead dog.

393
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,496
I'll just say we found it abandoned
a couple blocks from here.

394
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:31,086
- Why the fuck would you say that?
- Well, it's just-- I...

395
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,171
It's not my truck, Dennis.

396
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,216
Someone else put it here.

397
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,970
Yeah. Sure. I know.

398
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,191
- Get back to work.
- Yes, sir.

399
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,524
He never would have let me do that
when he was alive.

400
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,113
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. You?

401
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,576
Well, Tom, I've had better days.

402
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,952
Yeah.

403
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,997
Um, what happened back there?

404
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:54,544
They had papers, some bullshit.
They didn't come to arrest me.

405
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,422
They opened fire
before they even got to the house.

406
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,051
Christine told me what you did.

407
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,723
Yeah, you told me to protect her,
right?

408
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,811
Don't just shrug
like you're not sure

409
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,607
what you want for supper, man.
You killed.

410
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:21,029
For great purpose, yes,
but you killed.

411
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,576
You're a good boy, Tom.
It's okay.

412
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,580
And that's why it feels like
there's poison inside you right now.

413
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,210
And it's gonna burn
until you're hollow.

414
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,796
Let me take it from you, man.

415
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,515
You don't have to feel
like this anymore.

416
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,938
Come on in.

417
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:06,157
I can't. I can't.

418
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,497
You're the one motherfucker
I can't figure out.

419
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,543
You're all suffering
and no salvation.

420
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,423
But that's why I chose you
to protect our girl.

421
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,053
I'm glad you're back together.

422
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:30,223
No, no, Tom, she can't come with me.

423
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,935
She's going with you.

424
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,749
Thanks for letting us
hijack your ride, boners.

425
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,292
Anytime.

426
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,294
Hey, get some fucking hand cream.

427
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,463
- Have a good night.
- Have a good night.

428
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,839
You, too.

429
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,553
So, you think she's really gonna use
that gun?

430
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,515
If I lost my whole family,
I'd need to shoot something.

431
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,727
- At least she's still here.
- What do you mean?

432
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,438
She could have run away someplace

433
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,358
and nobody would have ever known
what happened to her,

434
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,942
but she's still here.

435
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,616
These jellybeans are stale.

436
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,329
They were probably for her kids.

437
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,349
Hi.

438
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,982
Do we have to?

439
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,076
Please, can we just have one night

440
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,453
where I don't have to give you
any of my stuff?

441
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,124
One night?

442
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,182
Do you even remember
what it feels like

443
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,976
to care about anything?

444
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,578
What?

445
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:09,299
No shit?
The hot cop?

446
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,844
And you're here?

447
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,053
It's my mom's.

448
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,684
I was saving it for last.

449
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,363
I don't want to feel this way
anymore.

450
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,924
She's far too important
to risk traveling with me right now.

451
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,637
Never stay in the same place
for too long,

452
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,180
don't ever tell anyone
your real name

453
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,640
and don't use your IDs.

454
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,268
- Have you got a phone?
- Yeah.

455
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,644
Give it to me.

456
00:42:55,906 --> 00:43:00,326
When it's time for what comes next,
I'll call you on this.

457
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,955
And get yourself a charger, man.
I lost mine.

458
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,999
Wayne, we have to go.

459
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,671
I love you.

460
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,507
I love you, too.

461
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,441
This girl is everything.
Yes?

462
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,694
Yes.

463
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,685
Road trip.

464
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:22,617
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

465
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,411
Fuck!

466
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,506
It's gonna be okay.

467
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,051
How?

468
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,889
Wayne told me.

469
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,056
Howdy.

470
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,728
Well, you gonna invite me in?

471
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,109
What's your pickup truck doing
in my driveway?

472
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,528
- I heard you were looking for it.
- Heard where?

473
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:43,698
Around.

474
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:49,746
What's your name?

475
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,915
Well, you asking me in
an official capacity or as a friend?

476
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:57,462
- We're not friends.
- Then I'd rather not say.

477
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,970
- Hey, Mr. Garvey.
- Hey.

478
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,388
These for us?

479
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,849
Young lady, why don't you put this
in the fridge for your dad?

480
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,436
Do not drink that.

481
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,273
So I found another pack.

482
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,610
Of what?

483
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,946
Dogs.

484
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,616
Couple dozen, I'd guess.

485
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,702
I saw them slinking around
the elementary school tonight

486
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:30,870
and they....

487
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,998
I'm pretty sure they're sleeping
in the drainpipe.

488
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,458
We could set up there
and pick them off

489
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,335
when they come out tomorrow night.

490
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,922
You meet my by the school
just before sundown?

491
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,134
Why can't you do it yourself?

492
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,846
Because I'm lonely.

493
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:57,855
Sundown tomorrow.

494
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,025
We're doing the Lord's work,
believe you me.

495
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:10,535
Hey!
Take your fucking truck.

496
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,789
No, it's all yours.
I'm done with it.

497
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,056
Who was that?

498
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,393
Nobody.

499
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:45,695
Hey, Betty.
How you doing?

500
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,781
- Mr. Garvey. Long time no see.
- Yeah.

501
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,660
Okay if I bring that in?

502
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,829
Long as he eats it while you're here
and you bring the jar out.

503
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,163
Deal.

504
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:12,013
How can he not like this?
It's great.

505
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,277
Prodigal son returns.

506
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:32,199
- I'll let you two catch up.
- Okay.

507
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,330
Kevin.

508
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,876
Hey, did you steal my bagels
this morning?

509
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,671
- Did I what?
- Never mind. Forget about it.

510
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,385
How you doing, Dad?

511
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,680
Said you got to eat it
while I'm here.

512
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,807
Yeah, yeah.
I know the rules.

513
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,484
Did she tell you
what's going on with me?

514
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:10,321
We got better things
to talk about than you.

515
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,032
Mmm.

516
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:17,787
How's my house?

517
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,790
Paul burned down the fence
in the backyard.

518
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,459
Fucking moron.

519
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,463
How's my job?

520
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,216
It's hard.

521
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:34,804
You know...

522
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:40,059
...it wouldn't kill you to show
a little vulnerability now and then.

523
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,520
People love that shit.

524
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,232
No one wants to see the Chief
of Police crying in his car.

525
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,444
You're crying in your car?

526
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,784
You know they all went?

527
00:49:57,077 --> 00:50:00,871
Balki, cousin Larry, Jennifer,
Mary Anne,

528
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,665
whole cast poofed on the 14th.

529
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,752
- Bullshit.
- No, look it up.

530
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,133
- Kids okay?
- Yeah.

531
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,385
Jill, she's fine.

532
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,721
Tommy's still out west, I think.

533
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:19,015
Been a while since we spoke.

534
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,726
Well, just
because he doesn't check in

535
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:26,313
as often as he should,
doesn't mean he doesn't love you.

536
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,154
How'd it start for you, Dad?

537
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,159
Well, that depends on what you mean
by "it", son.

538
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,661
You know what I'm talking about.

539
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:44,832
If you're asking me
when I started losing my shit?

540
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:50,004
Contrary to the professional opinion
of others,

541
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:53,382
I maintain my shit remains intact.

542
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:59,597
Now, I'd venture to guess
the reason you're here seeing me

543
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:02,641
your shit may be getting lost.

544
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:06,604
No, not an unreasonable assumption,

545
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,147
considering you've been running
around

546
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,524
shooting dogs in the middle
of the fucking night.

547
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:14,070
- Fucking Lucy.
- No, don't take it out on her.

548
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,363
She's trying to cover for you.

549
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,367
Why don't you tell that shrink
she sent you to...

550
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,120
...that you were drunk...

551
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,873
...and that you were under
a lot of stress,

552
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,251
and you're very, very sorry?

553
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,379
You realize now
that it was wrong to--

554
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,299
Will you please shut up?

555
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,512
No, no, I'm not gonna tell him.

556
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,223
Tell me what, dad?

557
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:45,059
He's here, isn't he?
That's something.

558
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,854
Why do I always have to--

559
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,440
Fuck you!

560
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,029
Someone came to see you?

561
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,284
What?

562
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,537
They said they sent...

563
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,831
Motherfucker.

564
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:11,377
They said they sent
or are sending somebody to help you.

565
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:16,340
Who?
Help me with what?

566
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,056
Ahh, I don't know.

567
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:30,271
But whatever it is...

568
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,400
...you might wanna keep it
to yourself.

569
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,036
- Hey, Chief, you good?
- Fantastic.
