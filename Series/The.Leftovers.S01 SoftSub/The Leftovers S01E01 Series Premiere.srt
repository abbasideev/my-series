1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,463
Uh, yeah, no.

2
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:09,174
I mean, you people called me.
I'm returning your....

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:15,848
Yeah, yes, I am. I do--
That's me. Sorry.

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,517
Are you the same person
I was just talking to?

5
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,978
Seriously,
I don't have the reference number.

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:25,441
When Mommy was single and 20,
she used to use quarters for this.

7
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,860
But now, she has to put money
into a machine

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,862
to get a card
to put into another machine.

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,864
Goddammit, come on!

10
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,783
Broke and the entire basement
was flooded.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,870
I know. The water was
totally up to our knees.

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,372
Ben's exercise shit
that he never uses,

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,541
the washer, dryer.

14
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,294
I'm actually at a laundromat
right now.

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,921
Can you-- I don't know.

16
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,467
Can you squeeze me in at 5:00,
or something?

17
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,510
Yeah, I--

18
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,722
Hold on.

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,892
The flippy thing,
there's a button, a red--

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,685
Yeah. Honey. It's okay, baby.

21
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,980
It's okay, baby. Shh.

22
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:08,358
Yeah, it's a red button.

23
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,236
You just, um....

24
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,490
Oh, my God, just press it in
with a pen or something.

25
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,784
That's perfect.

26
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,037
It'll start back up.
Okay, I'm in the car right now.

27
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,414
Can you make the formula?
I'm gonna be home in--

28
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,424
Sam?

29
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,930
Sam?

30
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,433
Sam?

31
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,311
Sam?

32
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,398
- Sam?
- Daddy.

33
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,074
- Where's my dad?
- Mommy.

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,659
Sam?

35
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,371
- What's going on?
- Daddy!

36
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:06,792
- Sam! Sam!
- Where are you?

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,002
See, he was buckled
right into that car seat!

38
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,420
He was right here!

39
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:14,466
He was right here in the car seat.
Sam, where are you? Sam!

40
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,759
Sam! Where is he?

41
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,803
He was right in there.
I don't understand.

42
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,221
Please call the police!

43
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,140
- Call 911! He was right in there.
- Daddy!

44
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,268
Sam! Sam! Sam!

45
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,645
Sam!

46
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,647
Sam!

47
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,650
- 911, what's your emergency?
- My son's missing.

48
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,236
- He was taken out right just....
- 911, what's your emergency?

49
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,329
I don't know where he is.
Can somebody please come help me?

50
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,497
She's gone.

51
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,835
Iran, 1.47 million.

52
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,337
Turkey, 1.55 million.

53
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,673
Germany, 1.71 million.

54
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,176
Egypt, 1.73 million.

55
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,886
Vietnam 1.55 million.

56
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,512
The thing one fails to grasp,

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,348
two percent
is not a staggering number.

58
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,143
That's only one out of every
50 humans on the planet.

59
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,062
Statistically speaking,
on the average football pitch,

60
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,064
none of the players
would be Departures.

61
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,360
The odds of losing someone in your
immediate family are slim at best.

62
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,031
Now, if you look at, let's say,
casualties from mass pandemics,

63
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,076
smallpox for one decimated
95 percent of the native population.

64
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,376
China, 27.18 million.

65
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,320
Come here.

66
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,906
Come.

67
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,662
Come on.

68
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,997
It's okay, I'm not gonna hurt you.

69
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,549
Hey!

70
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:24,930
Hey!

71
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,548
French Club's croissants
will be outside the cafe after lunch.

72
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,592
And, finally,

73
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,428
the Denziger Commission Report
was released this morning.

74
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,014
We'll be live streaming the hearings
in the auditorium all day

75
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,224
and the guidance staff
will be available

76
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,061
for anyone who needs to,
you know, talk it out.

77
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,021
Thank you, Glen.

78
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,523
Let's rise
for the Pledge of Allegiance.

79
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:03,070
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America

80
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,447
and to the republic
for which it stands.

81
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,240
One nation under God,

82
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,744
indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

83
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,372
And now, for those who want to,

84
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,791
let us pray for mercy
and forgiveness

85
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:19,294
and return
of those who've left us.

86
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,413
Good morning, this is Dusty
Bob, and this one goes out to Boon

87
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,706
who lost his lovely Alysse
at the Cracker Pickle,

88
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,083
three years ago today.

89
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,876
Alysse, we don't know where you are.

90
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,254
We sure do hope
there's pickles up there.

91
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,466
A little Patsy Cline for you all.
Let's go teardrop hunting.

92
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:36,121
Jesus, how many more cars
I'm gonna have to get in and out of?

93
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,458
This is it, Congressman.
Is it cool if I call you that?

94
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,545
Call me whatever shit you want.
Just drive, kid.

95
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,256
You got something for me?

96
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,223
Cool. Thanks.

97
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,559
Would you mind
giving me your phone, please?

98
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,190
I promise you'll get it back
once you've talked to him.

99
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,156
You mind?

100
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,452
Are you fucking serious?

101
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,214
To quote Wittgenstein,

102
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:32,052
"Whereof one cannot speak,
thereof one must remain silent."

103
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,930
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Doctor.

104
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,432
So we're clear.

105
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,227
We convened the council of clerics,

106
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,521
representatives
of most world religions.

107
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,939
Who, as you know,

108
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,149
were somewhat conflicted
about October 14th.

109
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,694
And were thus unable to reach
any kind of consensus,

110
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,946
which in turn led us

111
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,199
to the scientific community
for answers.

112
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,369
This document,
the findings of your commission

113
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,872
as to the instantaneous
disappearance

114
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,500
of two percent
of the world's population,

115
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,419
some 140 million souls,

116
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,090
your conclusion
as to what happened to them,

117
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,885
why them and where they've gone is,

118
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,887
and I'm paraphrasing here.

119
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,557
"I don't know"?

120
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,850
Sir, I am a scientist

121
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,852
and I was asked
to look at the data.

122
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,272
In fact, I was asked
to identify patterns

123
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:53,026
that weren't immediately obvious
and address related events

124
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,987
like the Chef Anomaly or
the Brandenburg Carousel

125
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,324
that were and still
are considered miracles,

126
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,160
but they are simply
statistical hiccups

127
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,495
that we can't explain.

128
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,707
Because, sir, in my opinion,

129
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,793
miracles do not exist.

130
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,253
Miracles do not exist?

131
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,506
Scientifically speaking,
no, sir.

132
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,051
Doctor,
pardon my tone,

133
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,970
but who are you, sir,

134
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:25,100
to tell the American people,
that millions

135
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:30,438
of mothers, fathers, sons,
and daughters disappeared.

136
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,359
Gone in an instant.

137
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,820
If that's not a miracle,

138
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,532
What in God's name
do you call it?

139
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,033
I don't know.

140
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,869
But if you're implying
it was a miracle,

141
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:50,166
I'm fairly certain, sir,
that God sat this one out.

142
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,583
- Hi, there. Mrs. Tunney?
- Yes?

143
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,879
- Chief Kevin Garvey.
- Garvey, I thought you went crazy.

144
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:46,222
Uh... That was my dad,
the former chief.

145
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:53,104
Mrs. Tunney, I'm here this morning
because I found your dog, Dudley.

146
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,690
And I'm sorry to say that he's...

147
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,444
Well, he's dead.

148
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,575
So?

149
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,662
I just thought you might wanna--

150
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,207
He's been gone for three years.
Ran away, never came back.

151
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,420
He was my husband's.
He's not coming back either.

152
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,966
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Is that what it is?

153
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,226
Dennis, it's me.
You anywhere on that pickup truck?

154
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,937
- You happen to get the plates?
- No. But, Dennis, Dennis.

155
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,146
No, there were no plates.

156
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,273
If there were pates,
I would have told--

157
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,692
Dennis? From now on, just say,
"I'm sorry, Chief.

158
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,486
As of now, I do not know shit."

159
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,154
Fine. I don't know shit.

160
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,990
I've got an hour before the meeting,
I'm gonna head to animal control--

161
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,076
Chief, you don't have an hour.

162
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,702
- That meeting was rescheduled.
- No.

163
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,371
It starts in five minutes.
Nobody told you?

164
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,706
- No, they said noon.
- Well, they changed it.

165
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,166
What-- Who changed it?

166
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,502
I don't know, must have been someone
from the mayor's office.

167
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,629
Everybody's sitting around
waiting for you.

168
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,714
All right, just stall them.

169
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,151
- So you're from Texas, huh?
- What gave you that idea?

170
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,529
I was down there
a couple of years ago

171
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,031
when I was looking at schools.
The people were really nice.

172
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,035
So you're in college?

173
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,580
I was. Not anymore.

174
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,957
Why not?

175
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,889
I didn't see the point.

176
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,183
Well, your folks must be so proud.

177
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,856
You know, Mr. Witten,
you don't have to be such a dick.

178
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,067
You're gonna forget
you ever felt this way.

179
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,403
What way?

180
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,866
Burdened.

181
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,877
You say that
to all of the people you drive?

182
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,297
Nope, sometimes I say, "Abandoned."

183
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:35,725
This Wayne, he's the real deal?

184
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,228
He's as real as it gets.

185
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,950
Hey, I told her you were late
because of a family emergency.

186
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,119
I'm late because her office gave me
the wrong fucking time.

187
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,329
That's gonna cut the parade in half.

188
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,290
It's a damn side street.
We can close it for three hours.

189
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,792
So what we're going to do--

190
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,796
- Everything okay, Chief?
- Your office told me noon.

191
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,758
Well, at least, that gave you time
to deal with your emergency.

192
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,805
Okay. The parade should end
about 11:00 at the park,

193
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,224
and then, we'll unveil the statue
which I'm told is terrifying.

194
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,475
We have to do that tomorrow?

195
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,769
Hector's been working
on it for a year.

196
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,396
It's kind of weird
just to leave the sheet on it.

197
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,148
Okay, we'll quickly
unveil the statue.

198
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,441
The Girl Scouts will read the names.

199
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,610
I'll say a few words,
introduce Nora Durst--

200
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,238
- What's she gonna say?
- She lost her entire family, Doug.

201
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,740
She'll say whatever the fuck
she wants to.

202
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,619
And there we have it,
our very first Heroes Day.

203
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,329
- Any questions?
- Yeah.

204
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,289
I still don't think they were heroes.

205
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,292
My brother-in-law disappeared
and he was a dip-shit.

206
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,547
They're heroes because
no one's gonna come to a parade

207
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,841
on "We Don't Know
What The Fuck Happened Day."

208
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,885
The DSD has proclaimed
a Federal Holiday of Remembrance.

209
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,554
And that's what they're calling
our Departed

210
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,432
because that's how we want
to remember them.

211
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,475
Everyone loves a hero.

212
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,687
So we're all gonna have
a nice walk through town,

213
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,940
have a good cry,
and then move on.

214
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,986
It's time.
Everybody's ready to feel better.

215
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,196
Not the Remnant.

216
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,825
At last, the Chief speaks.

217
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,453
I would've said something sooner,
but I was so riveted.

218
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,540
So we're gonna do this again?

219
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,169
The whole town,
the same place at the same time,

220
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,879
on the anniversary.

221
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,590
You're...
You're inviting them to show up.

222
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,841
The G.R. isn't a threat.

223
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,885
If they wanna stage
a non-violent protest,

224
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,136
that's their right.

225
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,388
You were at the homecoming.
They walked right onto the field.

226
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,724
And then, they walked right off.
No harm done.

227
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,352
- They are trying to provoke us.
- Then don't get provoked.

228
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,606
A year ago,
these people didn't even exist.

229
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,943
Now there's almost 50 of them.
They bought up an entire cul-de-sac.

230
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,613
You know, you're saying this to me
as if I didn't already know it.

231
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,909
I don't know shit, Lucy. Do you?

232
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,370
Where did they come from?
What do they want?

233
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,247
You don't even know who they are.

234
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,249
We know who they were.

235
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,339
They're gonna come tomorrow.

236
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,884
And when they do,
somebody's gonna get hurt.

237
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,386
You want me to call it off?

238
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,350
Yeah. I want you to call it off.

239
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,685
No.

240
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,862
You're wrong.

241
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,157
Nobody's ready to feel better.

242
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,952
I'm ready to fucking explode.

243
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,380
Come on, girls.
Spread it out!

244
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,146
Come on, girls.
Sticks down.

245
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,788
What the fuck, Jill?

246
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:35,006
Jill, I'm sure things have been hard
since your mother went away.

247
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,465
I'm fine.

248
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,177
Are you?

249
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,597
I'm sorry, if I'm gonna put you back
on that field,

250
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,349
I need your word
that this won't happen again.

251
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,563
Yeah, okay.

252
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,568
As long as that cunt
stays away from me.

253
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,888
- Tom.
- Hi, Pete. How are you doing, man?

254
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,514
Good, good, how about you?

255
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,351
- All right. Nobody followed you?
- Nope, took the long way up.

256
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,187
- You get the phone?
- Yeah, yes, sir.

257
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,732
- You're the mayor or something?
- Congressman.

258
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,235
Congressman. Excuse me, sir.

259
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,408
Two coming up.

260
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,579
Come on. Come on, Jack.

261
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,927
Congressman,
we're happy to have you here.

262
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,430
- How was your trip?
- Fine, thanks.

263
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:11,519
I'm sorry about those irritating
security procedures.

264
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,564
- I'm sure you're used to that.
- Yes.

265
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,446
Go on in.

266
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,540
Wayne, this is Congressman Witten.

267
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,304
Can you help me?

268
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,992
- Is that what I think it is?
- Yup.

269
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,912
- You are the best.
- Ask and you shall receive.

270
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,001
Don't worry about it. Sit down.

271
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,089
Mmm.

272
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,176
So tell me, who got sent home?
I know you watched it.

273
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,346
- Kaitlin got booted.
- No way.

274
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,182
Yeah, Brian took her up
on this hot air balloon

275
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,393
and told her how he felt
this amazing connection, whatever.

276
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,020
Got her into the fantasy suite?

277
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,191
I mean, what woman can resist
a hot tub and about 400 roses?

278
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,527
Jesus! What? Try one at a time.

279
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,946
I can't, they're too good.

280
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,580
You need to answer that?

281
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,542
No, ma'am. I do not.

282
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:03,714
Hey, it's Tom.
I'm not here. God bless. Beep.

283
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:09,178
Hey, Tommy, it's your daddy.
Just wanted to hear your voice.

284
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:05,336
I didn't even know you're capable
of saying the word cunt.

285
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,670
I say it all the time.

286
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,548
- To who?
- Cunts.

287
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:12,968
Ladies.

288
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,641
- They kick you off the team?
- I got off with a warning.

289
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,520
But if my attitude doesn't change,
Coach is gonna call my dad.

290
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,189
Well, I got to say, Jill,
your attitude does kind of suck.

291
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,691
Really?

292
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,694
You just get all intense and...

293
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,656
...melancholy and shit sometimes,

294
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,242
which is why you need
to come to Dorfman's tonight.

295
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,369
And Nick's gonna be there.

296
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,377
Yeah, Nick.

297
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,713
- Stop.
- Yeah, Nick.

298
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,968
Yo, ladies.

299
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,678
Wanna get stoned
and play some ping pong?

300
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,596
We're already stoned.

301
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,390
Okay.

302
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,849
Then we can skip
right to the ping pong.

303
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,102
And by ping pong, you mean?

304
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:09,441
Uh... It's like tennis,
but easier with a little white ball.

305
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,113
I like your Prius.
We're gonna pass.

306
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,449
Right on. As you were.

307
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,830
- You going to Dorfman's tonight?
- Maybe.

308
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:31,422
Ooh, girl, someone wants to show you
his little white ball.

309
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,594
- Stop.
- Yeah, Nick.

310
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,398
- How'd it go?
- I am no longer burdened.

311
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,735
- All gone?
- All gone.

312
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,403
- So, you ready to go home?
- Yes.

313
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,946
Actually, Tom.

314
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,241
We're gonna have Doug
take the congressman home.

315
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,493
Wayne would like to speak with you.

316
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,248
- To me?
- Yes, Tom, you.

317
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,042
See you.

318
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,296
Is everything okay?

319
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,131
Why don't you stay here
tonight, Tom?

320
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,425
Get some dinner.
There's a bed in the bunk house.

321
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,385
Wayne will come to you.

322
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,348
- Do you know what it's about?
- Tom. He'll come to you.

323
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:47,164
Thank you for letting me
crash your dinner, Mr. Garvey.

324
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:52,252
I think it's awesome that you guys
have this family thing every night.

325
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,173
Hear that, Jill?
Aimee thinks it's awesome.

326
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,178
How was hockey practice?

327
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,392
Same old, same old.

328
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,689
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

329
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,359
This meatloaf's fucking spectacular.

330
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,824
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said about my cooking.

331
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,537
So, Mr. Garvey, are you
keeping the peace and what-not

332
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,372
at tomorrow's parade thingy?

333
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,000
You're not going, are you?

334
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,462
Probably not, it sounds depressing.

335
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,715
You don't want us to go?

336
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,050
No. I'd rather you didn't.

337
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,970
- Why not?
- I would just rather you didn't.

338
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,972
I would just rather
you tell me why not.

339
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,600
Do you really wanna go,
or you're just busting my balls?

340
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,728
Busting your balls.

341
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,230
You know what, Mr. Garvey,

342
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:58,068
Jill and I have been discussing
her whole attitude thing lately.

343
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,572
- You have?
- Yeah, and...

344
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,075
We both think that, you know,
she's been under a lot of stress

345
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,078
and it might actually
do her some good

346
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,415
to just, you know, come out,
tonight and have a good time.

347
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,208
Where is this good time happening?

348
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,754
It's a guy's house. Jay Dorfman.

349
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,047
- Dorfman?
- Yeah.

350
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,467
It's, you know,
just a small get together thing.

351
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,219
- His parents will totally be there.
- Good.

352
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,388
And it's all the way
on the other side of town,

353
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,015
so maybe Jill could borrow your car.

354
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,023
No drinking.

355
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,777
I don't drink.

356
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:45,157
All right. Have fun.

357
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,035
- Come on, Aimee.
- Please don't come tomorrow.

358
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,789
I would--
Jill, I would really appreciate it.

359
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,876
And if it's a party, you better hope
no one calls the cops.

360
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,629
- Yeah, yeah.
- Text me Dorfman's phone number.

361
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,514
You're doing your best.

362
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:48,136
It's okay. Just ignore them.

363
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,514
Come on.

364
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,494
- Yo, Nick, spin, let's go!
- Nick. Nick.

365
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,924
- I don't have to do it.
- It's cool.

366
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,176
- I don't have to do it. It doesn't--
- Go for it.

367
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,261
Jill, I don't care.
I seriously don't have to.

368
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,596
Please. Have fun.

369
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,985
And that's the beauty of it.

370
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,613
So, if we do it in Hawaii

371
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,491
and half the guest list
won't even show up, just--

372
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,660
I've got to the point, right?

373
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,120
Mm-mm.

374
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,581
Honey.

375
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:44,378
Listen, I know that this is all
a little overwhelming.

376
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,964
Planning a wedding is a big deal.

377
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,844
- It's not, actually.
- What?

378
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,806
Well, it's just a party, right?

379
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,350
We're exchanging vows.

380
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,521
Yeah, but that's not the wedding.

381
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,731
That's exactly what the wedding is.

382
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,403
No, the wedding
is picking fucking centerpieces.

383
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,535
I'm sorry.

384
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:21,248
It's just like you said,
it's overwhelming.

385
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,211
I'm really looking forward to it.

386
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,547
Yeah, me, too.

387
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,051
What?

388
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,431
Oh. Fucking God.

389
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,808
Here goes some crazy....

390
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,405
My fiancée is going
through some stuff, and....

391
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,482
Do it, do it.

392
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,323
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

393
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,452
Fuck!

394
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,414
It's on you, boo.

395
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,768
- Go get him.
- Choke!

396
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:10,398
Choke! Choke! Choke!

397
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:23,703
We don't have to do anything.
I mean, I won't tell.

398
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,707
I have other rules, Garvey.
You could do whatever you want.

399
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:39,553
It must have been Dorfman's
little sister's room or something.

400
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,265
Probably keeping it
in case she comes back.

401
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,642
She's not coming back.

402
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,687
None of them are.

403
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,523
Yeah, probably not.

404
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,651
So...

405
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,990
How are you doing, you know,
like with your mom and all?

406
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,784
Fantastic, Max.
Thanks for asking.

407
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,872
Sorry.

408
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,668
Come on, come on.
Be respectful.

409
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,182
So, what's up
with Nick and Aimee, huh?

410
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,600
I thought you guys are friends.

411
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,853
Doesn't she know you want to, like,
have his babies and shit like that?

412
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,897
Max, please stop talking.

413
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,905
- Do you mind if I jerk off?
- Be my guest.

414
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,709
So, I mean,
aren't you gonna choke me or what?

415
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,219
Yeah, that's good.

416
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,597
Oh, yeah, that's good.

417
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,977
Yeah.

418
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,940
Yeah, that's good.

419
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,738
Would you, baby?

420
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,615
Goddamn it!

421
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,537
Come back.

422
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,250
What the fuck do you want?

423
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,461
Why the fuck are you following us?
You're everywhere!

424
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:22,173
You're fucking everywhere!
Go away!

425
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:14,351
Do you even remember
the trajectory of where they end?

426
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,686
See if they bounced off
the curb or something, I don't know.

427
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,855
Yeah, I can't see. It's dark.

428
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,858
- Hey, do you have a flashlight?
- What?

429
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,695
I was getting out of the car,
and I saw this baby shoe,

430
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,364
and I leaned over to get it.

431
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,157
He was tossing me the keys,
but I didn't know.

432
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:33,036
So, they kind of sailed
into nowhere.

433
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,455
At least we got a baby shoe.

434
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,755
I think my dad
might have some flares or something.

435
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,508
Yeah, all right. Okay.

436
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,260
- How was the party?
- It's over.

437
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,055
Everybody's either wasted
or hooking up.

438
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,641
- You got to spin?
- Yeah.

439
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,646
There's a dead dog in your trunk.

440
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,733
Is it yours?

441
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:07,946
No.

442
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,829
Does it say his name?

443
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,250
Dudley.

444
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,044
Dudley is kind of a shit name.

445
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:26,089
- Why did your dad shoot him?
- He didn't shoot him.

446
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,842
- Then why was he in the trunk?
- I have no idea.

447
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,593
He just wouldn't shoot a dog.

448
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,763
Unless Dudley is one of the ones
that went nuts in the 14th.

449
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,765
I heard there's a whole pack of them
that lives out in the woods

450
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:38,393
- behind the state hospital.
- That's urban legend bullshit.

451
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,479
I know loads of people with dogs
and none of them ran away.

452
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,524
No, no, no. Not all of them did.
Just the ones that witnessed it.

453
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,110
You know, who were actually there
when someone went....

454
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,364
Dogs are just animals, man.

455
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,616
They're not like us
trying to reason it all out

456
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,743
and make sense of shit
that makes no sense.

457
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,873
They see something like that
and they just snap.

458
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,876
All bets are off right there.
No more chasing sticks.

459
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,170
No more licking your own balls.

460
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,297
They just go primal, man.

461
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,967
Same thing is gonna happen to us.
It's just taking longer.

462
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:44,375
Goodbye, Dudley.
I hope it's easier now.

463
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,632
We're sorry you got stuck with us.

464
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,535
Tom.

465
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,375
Tom? Get up, man.

466
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,169
Wayne.

467
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,505
How are you?

468
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:35,385
- We need to talk about Christine.
- Okay.

469
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,015
Isn't she one of the girls
that lives here?

470
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,518
Look at you.

471
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,562
"Isn't she one
of the girls who lives here?"

472
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,232
You chat her ass up

473
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,402
and bring her candy
every time you do a drop off, man.

474
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,904
Wayne, I swear--

475
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,115
She's important, you know,
she's very important.

476
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:00,410
And I need you to protect her.

477
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,454
From what?

478
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,124
Some bad shit's coming
and there's no getting around it.

479
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,918
I need you to keep her close,
keep her safe,

480
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,213
and keep your fucking hands off her.

481
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,550
- Okay?
- Yeah.

482
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,052
Okay.

483
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,307
I've been having this dream, Tom.

484
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,602
It's the same one over and over.

485
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,104
It's about my son.

486
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:33,276
"We're going, Daddy," he says to me.

487
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,780
And all the people who stayed...

488
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,575
They're pretending like
it never happened.

489
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:46,581
They're asleep,
but they need to wake up now.

490
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,876
So, I asked him, why now?

491
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:55,632
And he says, "Therefore...

492
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:03,056
...watch and remember
that by the space of three years,

493
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:09,062
I seize not to warn them
night and day with tears."

494
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,815
- Three years?
- Three years.

495
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,150
That's tomorrow.

496
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:22,575
Grace period's over, Tom.

497
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,166
It's time to go to work.

498
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,419
Tomorrow's October 14th.

499
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:36,339
So, it's time again for the world
to mourn the Departed.

500
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,634
We're gonna talk about what's
going on in the past three years.

501
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,678
And you can tell us
what you are thinking.

502
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,513
Caller number one, go ahead.

503
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,348
Corinthians 15....

504
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:56,526
- Jack, I need...
- So, who got the Bible...

505
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,898
- Hello?
- Hey, Chief, where are you?

506
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:39,110
Parade starts in ten minutes.
The mayor's losing her shit.

507
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:42,822
Should I--
Just try to stall or something?

508
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,743
Jill, honey?
I got to go to the parade.

509
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,544
Where the hell are you,
and where the hell is my car?

510
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,879
Unless you are dead,

511
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,047
you have exactly ten minutes
to call me back.

512
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:03,301
Do you understand me?
Ten minutes.

513
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:08,973
What the fuck?

514
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:41,422
Hey, Tony, got him.
Are you okay? What happened?

515
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,216
Jill took the car
and didn't come home last night.

516
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,467
Jesus.

517
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:48,137
Should we send around
a couple of cars after the ceremony?

518
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,556
- Are you worried?
- Dennis, I'm always fucking worried.

519
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:58,105
- What's up with the clown?
- She always does the parade.

520
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:01,984
- The kids love her.
- No fucking clowns. Jesus Christ.

521
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,487
- Chief Garvey.
- Mayor.

522
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,824
- Where have you been?
- Securing the parade route.

523
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,284
Uh-huh.
Did you see anything interesting?

524
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,995
Just a lot of people
ready to feel better.

525
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,997
They need this. We all do.

526
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,958
Talk to me in a few hours.
See if you still feel that way.

527
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,669
- Because the G.R. is coming.
- Yeah. They definitely are.

528
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,839
Then do your job, Kevin.
Maintain the peace.

529
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,925
Yes, ma'am.

530
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,411
Why are you here?

531
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,038
It wasn't the rapture.

532
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,456
They were no better than us.

533
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,750
I have proof, free of charge.

534
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:27,129
She beat her children.
Does that sound like a good person?

535
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:30,132
She beat her children!

536
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,551
- It was not the rapture.
- Matt.

537
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,139
- Do we need to do this today?
- Especially today, Officer.

538
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,557
- Chief.
- Right, Chief. Sorry.

539
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,602
Hey, next time you see your dad,
you tell him he's off the hook.

540
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,562
I will be sure and do that, Matt.

541
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,148
- You're off the hook, too, Chief.
- Thank you.

542
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,653
What are you doing?

543
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,323
Be gone.

544
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,539
Jill!

545
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,253
- Where the hell were you last night?
- At a friend's.

546
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,879
- What friend?
- Does it matter?

547
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,465
- I want to be here.
- I don't give a shit what you want.

548
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,467
Why was there a dead dog
in your trunk?

549
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,513
Shit.

550
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:25,563
Testing one, two. Mic check.
Check, check, check.

551
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,690
I guess you should go,
do your thing.

552
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:37,867
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.

553
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:42,038
So many of our loved ones
were lost three years ago.

554
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:46,042
It's hard to know how to talk
about them without feeling....

555
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,629
Well, we really don't know
how to feel.

556
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:56,385
Because we still wonder
where they went and why.

557
00:50:57,262 --> 00:51:00,056
We honor them now
with this remembrance,

558
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,350
Mapleton's Own
October 14th Memorial.

559
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,685
Hector, would you please?

560
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:18,908
Thank you, Hector. Outstanding.

561
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,624
- Fran Clary.
- Gary Van Nuis.

562
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:31,504
- Patrick Richard Younger.
- Joyce Wong.

563
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:35,382
- Maggie Roninberg.
- Bob Nash.

564
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,803
Colby Parker, Phil McMullen.

565
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:42,598
Gerald Marcus Zimmeran--
Zimmerman, sorry.

566
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,975
Thank you, girls,
for that beautiful remembrance.

567
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:51,232
Every one of us was touched
by the events of October 14th,

568
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:55,194
but no one
more than our honored speaker,

569
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,904
Nora Durst.

570
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:19,218
"The best day of my life happened
a few months before October 14th,

571
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,512
but I didn't know it.

572
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:27,268
It just seemed like, a nice day,
you know.

573
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:29,645
All four of us at the beach,
my husband,

574
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:33,816
my six-year-old son
and my four-year-old daughter.

575
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:37,278
Their names were...

576
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:44,076
...are Doug, Jeremy, and Erin.

577
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,829
The kids built a sandcastle,

578
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,623
Doug and I, we just sat on a blanket
and watched them work

579
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:53,335
and it was just perfect. And...

580
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,882
...it felt like...

581
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,761
...I didn't deserve anything
that...

582
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,097
...good.

583
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,061
This one Saturday,
the winter before that,

584
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,689
we all got hit with the stomach flu,
the whole family.

585
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,025
We were all feverish
and throwing up,

586
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,359
and I couldn't even get out of bed.

587
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,988
And the kids were lying there
with us

588
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,824
and I could feel the heat
coming off their bodies,

589
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:27,494
and I remember thinking,
this is it, I was gonna die.

590
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,213
I'm not greedy.

591
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:41,217
I'm not asking for that perfect day
at the beach.

592
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:48,474
Just give me that horrible Saturday,
all four of us sick and miserable.

593
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,560
But alive and together."

594
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,396
Hey, check it out.

595
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,858
What the hell
are you doing here?

596
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,697
All units on foot,
north side of the park, now.

597
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:16,377
- Dad.
- Go home, now. Now!

598
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,155
Fuck this.

599
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:06,093
Get out of here!
Get the fuck out of here!

600
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,500
Get out of my way! Get back!

601
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,609
Hold the line!

602
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:59,164
Do not talk about this
as if it has something to do

603
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:03,210
with what we have and have not done
as if there are sort of rule book.

604
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,921
Everybody knows
that the Holy Word of God--

605
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,424
You're talking about the Bible.
You're talking about the Bible.

606
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,384
We're trying to have
a secular conversation here

607
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,594
and you wanna talk about God's will.

608
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,763
If it's not the will of God,
whose will is it?

609
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:18,434
It is no one's.
It is arbitrary, it is meaningless.

610
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:22,563
And anyone who suggests otherwise,
is trying to start his own cult.

611
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:23,897
I'll tell you who's starting a cult,

612
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:25,941
scientists who believe
in worshipping their own--

613
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:27,693
Science always...

614
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,362
Empirical evidence always rules.
There is no atheist apostle.

615
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:35,075
Einstein said that God
doesn't play dice with the universe.

616
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:39,329
There are spiritual
explanations, that you can't explain.

617
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,291
God brings along the peace
Arbitrary, meaningless.

618
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,834
Stop digging where there isn't....

619
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,713
- Christ, Mike, turn the shit down.
- Copy that, Chief.

620
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,132
I am not afraid. I am here--

621
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:56,889
Pope, I get the Pope.
But Gary fucking Busey?

622
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,057
How does he make the cut?

623
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,977
Ours is not the reason why, Mike.

624
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,356
What happened to your eye?

625
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,820
A woman hit me with her shoe.

626
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,327
Come on, really?

627
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,579
Really. Mike, can I get another one?

628
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,582
Are you sure, Chief?

629
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,293
Yeah, I am. Thank you
for your concern.

630
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,511
Where were you?

631
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,681
When it happened, where were you?

632
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:50,859
I was in my house,
cleaning out a gutter.

633
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,863
Oh.

634
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,537
Where were you?

635
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:10,087
I was in a parking lot...

636
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,549
...at the laundromat.

637
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,222
Hey.

638
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,141
We're still here.

639
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,145
We sure are.

640
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,912
Hey.

641
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:54,256
I saw you. Stop that car.
I saw what you did.

642
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,924
You cannot kill our dogs.

643
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,426
Get the fuck out of that car
right now.

644
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,927
Stop that truck right fucking now!

645
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,598
Fuck!

646
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:06,935
You cannot kill our fucking dogs!

647
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,310
I know you don't speak.

648
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,979
I'm looking for someone
named Laurie.

649
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,567
If you could tell me
what house she's in.

650
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,320
Just point.

651
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,702
Laurie!

652
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,083
Laurie!

653
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:15,837
Laurie!

654
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:19,716
I'm gonna go up there.

655
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:46,493
Hi.

656
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,040
Are you okay?

657
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,338
No.

658
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,180
Come on. Let's take a walk.

659
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:13,645
Let's just go walk,
sit on the grass or something.

660
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:17,816
I know.

661
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:24,740
Thank you
for fucking underlining that.

662
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,409
Jesus Christ.
I'm trying to talk to my wife!

663
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,765
Please, come home.

664
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,937
Please, come home!

665
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:03,987
Fuck!

666
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:25,277
I was wondering
if I could stay here.

667
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,114
Maybe for just a couple of nights.

668
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:33,535
You can stay here for as long
as you want to, sweetheart.

669
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:36,663
My name is Patti. What's yours?

670
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,708
Meg.

671
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,794
- Hello, Meg.
- Hello.

672
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,171
This is Laurie.

673
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:47,674
She's gonna take care of you
while you're here.

674
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,564
Meg.

675
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,609
You and I won't speak again.

676
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:20,201
Come on, Tommy.
Pick up the goddamn phone.

677
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:11,795
Were you in my house last night?

678
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:54,879
- They are not our dogs.
- What?

679
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:59,259
You said they are our dogs.
They're not.

680
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:02,637
Not anymore.

681
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:06,808
Am I awake?

682
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,148
You are now, Chief.

683
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,488
- You have a gun?
- Yeah.

684
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,324
Then what the fuck
are you waiting for?
