1
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,409
Fuck you, you fucking cunts.

2
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,879
Hey. Hey. Please.

3
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,274
Please. Please don't.

4
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,734
Please.

5
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,446
Please. Please. Don't.

6
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,656
Please stop.

7
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:42,161
Please. Please. Please stop.

8
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:46,874
Don't! Please stop!

9
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,962
Please. Stop.

10
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,787
Where is everyone going?

11
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,797
Whatever happened, I wanna help.

12
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,447
Out of the way, goddamn it!
Move aside!

13
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Thanks, Brad.

14
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,803
I'm here at the Heaven's Converts
compound in Noma, Florida,

15
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,223
where cult members recently opened
fire on ATFEC agents.

16
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,142
Tensions between the cult
and the agency

17
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,935
have been escalating for days,

18
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,562
starting when ATFEC--

19
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,295
Morning.

20
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,505
Hey, I'm leaving in 10 minutes.
You want a ride to school?

21
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,965
Uh-uh.

22
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,134
Have you seen
a bunch of my white shirts?

23
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,385
No.

24
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,929
- You sure?
- Yes.

25
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,812
Morning, Mr. Garvey.
You want me to make coffee?

26
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,986
Hey!

27
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,739
Did you turn the alarm off
last night?

28
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,159
Nope. It wasn't on.

29
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,661
It was. I set it to "Stay."

30
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,499
- Motion detector deactivated.
- Looks like you mastered it.

31
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,397
Where is she?

32
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,417
Are you surprised?

33
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,548
We want them to remember something
they wanna forget.

34
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,842
They weren't just gonna
leave us alone, right?

35
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,844
It was only a matter of time.

36
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:27,148
I guess I should be scared,
but I'm not.

37
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,693
Is that weird?

38
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,586
Fuck.

39
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,425
I just hope
she didn't have to suffer too much.

40
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,514
Are you okay?

41
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,974
Hold on.

42
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:05,103
It's okay. Laurie, it's okay.

43
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,147
Laurie. God.

44
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,191
I think we need some help!

45
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,611
Laurie, it's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

46
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,699
Just breathe.

47
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,121
It's okay. It's okay.

48
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,540
Help! It's okay.

49
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,460
Somebody, please help!

50
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,965
Hey!
What are you doing? Hey!

51
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,759
- You got the rocks?
- What?

52
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,594
The rocks.

53
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,056
We need the pictures of position
before you can bag them.

54
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,141
Yeah, okay, sorry.

55
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,351
Give me a break, all right?

56
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,770
She lived with you for a year.
You got no emergency contact?

57
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,896
Nobody?

58
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,443
- "No family."
- I guess she just grew on a tree.

59
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,028
You get statements from everyone
in their search party?

60
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,196
Yes, sir.

61
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,032
Mike's at the Biggie,
getting yellow pads in bulk.

62
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,326
I need you off the streets.

63
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,329
I don't have the resources
to protect you.

64
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,665
I know.
Tell me to fuck off. I get it.

65
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,712
Good. Thanks.

66
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,715
Hey, Chief.

67
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,008
One of the witnesses says

68
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,177
he's gonna late for his
ballroom dancing lesson.

69
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,595
Okay if I let him go?

70
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,774
Your boys gonna give me my gun back?

71
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,776
It doesn't shoot rocks.

72
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,407
- What were you doing out here?
- Drinking beers, star-gazing.

73
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,160
Hell, you could have been my alibi
if you didn't keep blowing me off.

74
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,287
- Hey, Dean.
- Burt.

75
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,918
We have an arrangement.
Population control.

76
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,713
Shit!

77
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,214
Hey, careful, goddamn it!

78
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,926
Fucking horrific.

79
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,063
Is that the best you can do?

80
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,195
Sorry to bother you,
but could I speak with my daughter?

81
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,905
No problem.

82
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,918
Jill. Jill. Honey.

83
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,253
Jill, what's wrong?

84
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,589
Jill? Jill?

85
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,758
- Wait.
- Just tell me.

86
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,761
Tell me what happened to her.
What happened to her?

87
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,721
No, no. Your mom's okay.

88
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,432
- Your mom's okay.
- Then why are you here?

89
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,772
Last night a woman was attacked,
in the G.R.

90
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,899
I wanted you to hear from me first
so you wouldn't worry.

91
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,859
Please don't tell your friends.

92
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,363
I want you home before dark.

93
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,200
You and Aimee order a pizza.
I'm gonna work late.

94
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,786
Might not see you
till the morning, okay?

95
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,205
I'll text you.

96
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,124
Okay, yeah.

97
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,089
I shouldn't have cried.

98
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,551
She wouldn't have cried for me.

99
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,849
Ready? Okay.

100
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,567
I understand we had a rough morning.

101
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,072
Sorry. Compound fracture.

102
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,951
Okay. I had a look at your tests.

103
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,537
Everything seems normal.
Let's have a listen.

104
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,626
All right.

105
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,588
May I ask how many cigarettes a day
you're smoking?

106
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,845
Okay, what you experienced
was most likely a panic attack.

107
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,556
If it happens again,
take two of these.

108
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,182
If you need more,

109
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,726
you're gonna need a prescription
from a psychiatrist.

110
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,604
You're free to go.

111
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,219
"Is the victim
a member of an organization

112
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:34,140
that claims an independent belief
not listed on the AWR?"

113
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,308
Check.

114
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,393
"Is the membership
of the organization--"

115
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,811
- It was not your call...
- ...currently comprised of more than

116
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,188
- ...to make!
- ...than 40 individuals?"

117
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,775
Check. "Has there been a pattern
of violent incidents involving...."

118
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,944
I know what it fucking says
because I signed that fucking thing!

119
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,696
Check!
"If these conditions are met..."

120
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,114
You gonna continue reading?

121
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,991
There's a whole bunch
of fucking big words in there

122
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,326
that you might not even
fucking understand!

123
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,412
"...Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms,
Explosives and Cult,

124
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,123
please contact the Bureau
immediately!"

125
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,292
Immediately!

126
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,253
How about I immediately shove that
fucking thing up your ass?

127
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,381
- Chief Garvey!
- Fat fuck.

128
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,177
What's up, gentlemen?

129
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,263
Det. Vitello took it upon himself
to call the feds

130
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,932
and punt on our homicide.

131
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,518
I was just doing my job
by following the guidelines--

132
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,146
Lou? Shut the fuck up.
Who'd you talk to at ATFEC?

133
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,526
- Agent Sean Kilaney.
- Great.

134
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,405
Please give Agent Kilaney's contact
information to your boss,

135
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,281
so that he can undo your fuck-up.

136
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,332
Thank you.

137
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,168
You need anything from me?

138
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,048
Curfew. Nobody out past dark.

139
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,677
Look, the town feels a response,

140
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,679
and if the G.R. violates,
I can arrest them.

141
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,723
I'll call a council meeting
for tomorrow.

142
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,349
Can you be there to make your case?

143
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,394
- I just made my case.
- It's a formality, Kevin.

144
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,320
I trust you,
but this is a fucking mess.

145
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,322
Lots of eyes on us.

146
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:18,286
You won't be influenced
by your family situation?

147
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,248
No. I won't.

148
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,720
- MasterCard gets us miles.
- We haven't flown in years.

149
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,556
- Miles are meaningless.
- They're obviously not meaningless.

150
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,600
- Yes, they are.
- Why do you keep saying that?

151
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,561
- Can you pull my wallet?
- I got it, I got it.

152
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,521
- I did, I did, I did.
- You got it?

153
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,939
Amanda.

154
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,192
Amanda, stop staring.

155
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,569
You, too.

156
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,619
Go.

157
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,566
Sean Kilaney at Alcohol, Tobacco
Firearms, Explosives and Cults.

158
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,568
Leave a message
and I'll hit you back.

159
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,905
Agent Kilaney, Chief Kevin Garvey
from Mapleton, New York.

160
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,992
One of our investigators
just spoke to you

161
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,743
about a possible
cult-related incident.

162
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,122
But his assessment was premature,
so we'd like to handle it ourselves.

163
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,917
If you give me a call back,
I'd appreciate it. Thanks.

164
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,033
Hey! Hey!

165
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,826
Sorry.

166
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,244
They're loud, but they're harmless.

167
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,913
Hey! Hey!

168
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,207
Don't worry about it.

169
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,752
Staking out the Moonies, huh?

170
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,923
They made an offer on my house.
Guess they're running out of room.

171
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,426
- Bought a church, too, I heard.
- Yeah.

172
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,889
One of them got killed, huh?

173
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,684
Sorry, I'm not allowed to discuss
ongoing investigations.

174
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,396
Don't investigate too hard.

175
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,491
- Hello?
- Dennis, it's me.

176
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,909
Yeah, Chief?

177
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,994
I want you to go
and pick up Reverend Jamison,

178
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,371
bring him in.

179
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,055
Morning, Mr. Garvey.

180
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,431
Why isn't the alarm on?

181
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,392
You didn't text me.

182
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,936
I didn't want it to go off at night
when you got home.

183
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,981
Well, that defeats the purpose.

184
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,113
Please, just set it, okay?

185
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,661
Mr. Garvey, we heard that the woman
who got killed

186
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,454
got dragged behind a truck
and, like, crucified.

187
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,790
- Is that true?
- He's not gonna tell you.

188
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,793
- No, Aimee, it's not true.
- See?

189
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,088
What a relief.

190
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,224
Is she okay?

191
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,102
She's Jill.

192
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,983
- What does that mean?
- She doesn't really do okay.

193
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,320
Can't win.

194
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,155
Now you're getting it.

195
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,795
You look nice.

196
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,465
Have a seat. Hungry?

197
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,510
They got all-day breakfast here.

198
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,683
What can I get for you, hon?

199
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,482
- Can we have a minute, please?
- Sure.

200
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,404
How long has it been
since you've spoken, Laurie?

201
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,115
About seven months?

202
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,826
Eight. Right.

203
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:37,665
Well, Laurie, you are overdue
for a day off.

204
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,545
No, no. You can talk.

205
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,965
Just for today.
Say anything you want to.

206
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,760
Hey, I'm doing it, too, right?

207
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,887
Are you ready?

208
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,063
She's gonna have French toast,

209
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,732
scrambled eggs, order of bacon,
large orange juice.

210
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,944
- Coffee? She's gonna have coffee.
- Coffee.

211
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,320
You got it.

212
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,491
This is fucking good.

213
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:31,010
Sean Kilaney at Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms, Explosives and Cults.

214
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,887
Leave a message
and I'll hit you back.

215
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,683
Agent Kilaney,
Kevin Garvey again from Mapleton.

216
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,978
I left you a message last night,
but I haven't heard back.

217
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,023
Please call me. It's important.

218
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,860
Hey, Officer Mustard Stain.
Dropping off or what?

219
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,404
I'm actually picking up.
You got some of my shirts here.

220
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,739
Sure. You have a ticket?

221
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,949
Just check the computer.
It's under Garvey.

222
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,244
- No ticket, no?
- No, no ticket.

223
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,669
- Okay, you pick up last Tuesday.
- No, I know, I know I picked up.

224
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,298
But I'm missing my white shirts.
Can you just check again?

225
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,850
Sorry. No shirts, huh?

226
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,937
- You didn't even look.
- I looked on computer.

227
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,688
- Unless you have ticket.
- I don't have a ticket.

228
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,942
If they turn up, we'll call you.
Okay?

229
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,693
Mr. Extra Starch!

230
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,363
- Dropping off or what?
- Yeah.

231
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,906
Don't give up.

232
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,243
They want you to surrender
and sell them on the black market.

233
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,828
- Stay strong.
- I hope you have a ticket.

234
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,413
I always have a ticket.

235
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,000
Well, you know what they say.

236
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,502
They'll turn up
once you stop looking for them.

237
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,004
You think so?

238
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,506
No, probably not.

239
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,221
All right, see you later, Nora.

240
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,808
- Bye.
- Mr. Four Eyes! Yes.

241
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,269
Where are we?

242
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,481
Statements from the Moonies.
I didn't check the spelling.

243
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,484
Dennis has your priest
in the war room.

244
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,487
Gonna give him your confession?

245
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,828
Hey, Matt.

246
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,125
Thanks for coming in.

247
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,922
So...

248
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,051
...where were you two nights ago?

249
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,845
Why?

250
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,640
Well, according to the hospital,

251
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,351
you had a rock thrown at you
a couple months ago,

252
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,978
one aimed at the G.R.

253
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,439
Then they repaid your generosity

254
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,024
by buying up your church out
from under you

255
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,483
and they painted it white.

256
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,114
You think I had something to do
with what happened to that woman?

257
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,490
No.

258
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,451
Just wanna know where you were
a couple nights ago.

259
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,786
I was at my house
with my study group.

260
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,997
A few of them spent the night.

261
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,583
I appreciate the extra help
with Mary.

262
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,878
- Can you give me their names?
- Of course.

263
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:24,308
- The woman. Did she have family?
- Why?

264
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,728
Back when I had the church,
I used to see her sometimes.

265
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,731
She'd just stand outside
the way they do.

266
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:35,319
She never talked to me, of course,
but I don't know.

267
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,029
She became a familiar face.

268
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,282
Do you think I could see her?

269
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,826
What, her body?

270
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,372
Yes.

271
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,374
You do realize
you're a suspect, Matt?

272
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:52,336
Well, obviously, but once I'm not,
I'd like to pray for her.

273
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:59,677
Please? It'll just be five minutes.

274
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,014
No. You can't see her.

275
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,269
Hey, Chief, it's 3:00.

276
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,604
They're in Town Hall,
waiting for you.

277
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,272
What? Who?

278
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,609
- The mayor, the curfew thing.
- Oh, shit!

279
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:26,912
Please, everyone calm down.
I do appreciate your patience.

280
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,248
Just a few more moments,
I promise you.

281
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,583
- What the fuck?
- They showed up. I didn't know.

282
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,544
What, I'm not allowed
to leave my own house?

283
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:37,089
- How long is this gonna last?
- Please, hold your questions.

284
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,007
Chief Garvey suggested the curfew,

285
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,968
and he's here to explain
exactly how it will go.

286
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,387
- Chief?
- Really?

287
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,517
Um...
Well, Miss Mayor...

288
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,187
I'm sure you're all aware

289
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:56,108
that a violent hate crime occurred
a couple nights ago

290
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,694
to a member of the Guilty Remnant.

291
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,739
While we conduct our investigation,

292
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,783
I thought it would be
in the best interests of the town

293
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,911
if people remained in their homes
after eight p.m.

294
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,079
I work nights!

295
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,958
I'm sure we can make exceptions
if you have to get to a job.

296
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,085
So we have to change our lives
because of them?

297
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,921
They broke into my house
on Christmas.

298
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,299
People, please,
we're trying to keep everybody safe.

299
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,217
You're not trying to keep us safe.

300
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,723
Excuse me?

301
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,933
It just doesn't seem fair,

302
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,395
us being locked up
inside our houses.

303
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,815
We didn't do anything wrong.

304
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,109
I mean, with all due respect, Chief.

305
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,071
How do we even know these people
didn't do this to themselves?

306
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,158
Because you were with them
when they found the body.

307
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,785
Well, I was with some of them.

308
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,621
What are you?
You don't even live here.

309
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,955
Well, sure I do.

310
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,751
And when I moved here,
hell, it seemed like a nice place.

311
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,295
- Are you fucking serious?
- Okay.

312
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:03,801
I think everyone's had their say.
This is not a public vote.

313
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,761
It's for the council alone.

314
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,974
And, for the record,
I fully support Chief Garvey.

315
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:16,104
All in favor of imposing
an emergency town-wide curfew

316
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:19,107
to start at eight p.m.,
effective this evening?

317
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,864
All opposed?

318
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,186
Where's Patti?

319
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,233
Get all your people together here
in five minutes

320
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,776
from all your fucking houses.

321
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,321
I'll wait.

322
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,038
It's just been made clear to me

323
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,207
that it's officially open season
on you people.

324
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,962
Now, the ideal thing would be
for you all to stay off the streets,

325
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,881
but we all know
that's not gonna happen, is it?

326
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,512
Whistles.
Keep these on you at all times.

327
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,557
Use them.

328
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,226
I got my people on extra patrols,
and they're ready to respond.

329
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:40,314
This doesn't have to happen again,
but that's on you.

330
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,191
No one understands
whatever it is you believe in.

331
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,651
They don't give a shit.

332
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,154
As long as you leave them alone.

333
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,906
But if you keep
following people around,

334
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,366
buying up their homes,
painting everything white...

335
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,662
...breaking into their houses,
they will retaliate.

336
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,875
Any questions?

337
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,090
I'll take them in writing.

338
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,389
Thank you for your time.

339
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,819
It's Meg, right?

340
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,741
- Do you still talk?
- Yes.

341
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:38,372
- Where's Laurie?
- I don't know.

342
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,920
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.

343
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,840
I'm the only person
that gives a shit about you people,

344
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,842
and you won't even tell me
where my wife is?

345
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,596
She's not your wife anymore.

346
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,991
- Okay. All done, girls?
- We are indeed.

347
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,368
Just the check.

348
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,329
Could I have a doggie bag,
please?

349
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,498
For what?

350
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,752
- Just get me the bag, sweetheart.
- Okay.

351
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,717
I brought her here, too.

352
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,761
Just over a year ago.

353
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,098
Gladys sat right there
where you're sitting right now.

354
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,892
I don't know how,

355
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,563
but she somehow got word
that her son had died.

356
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,024
Did she ever tell you she had a son?

357
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:52,195
No. It was over in Yemen, I think.

358
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,449
His helicopter just crashed
or some such.

359
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,661
And as you can imagine,
she did not take it very well.

360
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:03,874
She questioned her commitment,
she became distracted,

361
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,294
and she began to feel again.

362
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,049
And there was a lot of moping
and crying around the house,

363
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:16,762
and then it started to happen
out in the open.

364
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,479
So I brought her here, I fed her.

365
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,815
And I invited her
to speak her troubles out loud.

366
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,736
I gave her
every opportunity to talk.

367
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,906
She never spoke one word.

368
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:41,244
Never broke, just like you.

369
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:47,876
So I'm going to tell you
what I told her.

370
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,342
I understand the pull.

371
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,057
I understand. It's your family.

372
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,185
It's your past.

373
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:13,401
I understand that going back to them
feels comfortable and easy...

374
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:21,660
...because the alternative,
what we do, is very, very hard.

375
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,167
But there can't be any doubt,
Laurie.

376
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:35,173
Because doubt is fire!

377
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:42,180
And fire is gonna burn you up
until you are but ash!

378
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,023
Okay. Ladies, come see us again.

379
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,821
Yeah.

380
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,376
You remember what you told me to do
in the last session?

381
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,338
Just before everything changed?

382
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,817
Can I be excused, please?

383
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,822
Yeah.

384
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,654
Okay, Reverend.
You want to pray over her? Fine.

385
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,365
What made you
change your mind?

386
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,243
The closest thing
she's gonna get to a funeral.

387
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,619
Shit.

388
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,126
Jesus said to his disciples,

389
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,505
"Compare me to something
and tell me what I am like."

390
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,508
And Thomas said to him,

391
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,470
"Teacher, my mouth is utterly unable
to say what you are like."

392
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,932
And Jesus said,
"I am not your teacher

393
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,559
because you have become intoxicated

394
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,187
from the bubbling spring
I have tended."

395
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:59,401
And he took Thomas and withdrew
and spoke three sayings to him.

396
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,654
When Thomas came back,
his friends asked him,

397
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,239
"What did Jesus say to you?"

398
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,033
And Thomas responded...

399
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,037
..."If I tell you
what he spoke to me,

400
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,623
you will pick up rocks
and stone me,

401
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,835
and fire will come from the rocks
and devour you."

402
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,095
You wanna tell me what that means?

403
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:33,351
It means it's easier to stay silent
than it is to speak truth.

404
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,148
Killing these people is pointless.

405
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,318
They don't care
because they're already dead.

406
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:49,659
You know, what I want
is to bring them back to life.

407
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,855
Oh, sorry about that.

408
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,068
Must be that one.

409
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,740
Uh, Billy?

410
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,743
What happened to the D.B.
in four?

411
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,496
- Female?
- Oh, we shipped her out.

412
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,331
You fucking shipped her? Where?

413
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,459
Sorry. We got an email ordering us
to send her out to Virginia.

414
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,838
It was from Agent Kilaney.

415
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,091
It says you guys called him.

416
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:50,804
Sean Kilaney at Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms, Explosives and Cults.

417
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,223
Leave a message
and I'll hit you back.

418
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,557
Listen, asshole.

419
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,393
You don't call me back
and then you email my morgue

420
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,061
and you pull my fucking body?

421
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:02,399
If you don't call within the hour,
I will be in my car driving to D.C.,

422
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,193
where I will personally
hit you fucking back!

423
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,444
Understood?

424
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,655
It's Kevin Garvey from Mapleton!

425
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,616
Fuck!

426
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,954
I say fuck, too.

427
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,432
Disarm system now.

428
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,061
- Disarm system now.
- Shit.

429
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,524
- Disarm system now.
- Shit.

430
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,862
Disarm system now.

431
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,281
Fuck!

432
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,662
Fuck.

433
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:45,001
Shit. Fuck!

434
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,172
System deactivated.

435
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,675
- Hello?
- Hey, Chief Harvey.

436
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,220
Sean Kilaney from ATFEC.
How are you?

437
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,805
Sorry I didn't get back to you
sooner. I was down in Florida.

438
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:00,099
Fucking mess.
You see it on the news?

439
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,019
- No.
- Count yourself lucky.

440
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,855
So, you got a cult-related homicide?

441
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,441
- Didn't you get my messages?
- Well, just one. You leave more?

442
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,319
You want us
to take jurisdiction, right?

443
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:14,989
Uh... Uh, no.
Don't worry about it.

444
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,075
Listen, you never should have
gotten that call.

445
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,953
One of my detectives jumped the gun.
Vitello.

446
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,623
- He said he spoke to you.
- Okay. Let me pull it up here.

447
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,877
Got it. Jesus. Right, the stoning.

448
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,380
Fuck. The victim was what,
Tomorrow's Family?

449
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,925
- No, The Guilty Remnant.
- Oh, those nuts.

450
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,219
What's up with the chain-smoking?

451
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,097
Look, you know what?
Sounds like you got your hands full.

452
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,599
They sent the body to you
a couple hours ago, it's not like--

453
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,601
Shit. They did?

454
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:48,147
- They said you emailed them.
- That's automated.

455
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,649
It gets sent to the local M.E.

456
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,277
as soon as they put a Tier 3
in the system.

457
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,071
Well, then send her back to me.
Send the body back.

458
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,239
Wish I could.

459
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,117
She's en route
to our forensic processing center.

460
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,286
Then how about I come down there,
I pick her up myself?

461
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:04,080
Sorry. Once she's in the system,
there's nothing I can do.

462
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:10,044
What about forensics, evidence,
our witness statements?

463
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,921
- You know what?
- You want me to--

464
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,881
You go ahead
and hold on to all of that, okay?

465
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,593
You should be hearing
from one of our field guys soon.

466
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,639
- In how long?
- Uh, four to six weeks.

467
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,224
Fuck.

468
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:27,061
Or, if you want,
we could eliminate the infestation.

469
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,480
Excuse me?

470
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,649
I can have three vans
full of armed agents there

471
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,192
by the end of the week.

472
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:37,447
They pay a visit to whatever compound
these fucks call home,

473
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,574
and they get you the results
you're looking for.

474
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:43,494
Chief, this shit spreads
if you let it.

475
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,625
Don't worry about your victim.
She doesn't give a shit.

476
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,669
Worry about your town.

477
00:43:54,632 --> 00:44:00,011
And The Guilty Remnant.
What would happen to them?

478
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:05,141
What happens is, they go away.

479
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,226
They're not your problem anymore.

480
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,231
Just say the word,
and everything can go back to normal.

481
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,568
Well, I appreciate that.

482
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,116
Hello? You still there?

483
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,578
- Chief?
- Uh...

484
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:33,711
But no thanks. We can handle it.

485
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,047
Okay.

486
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,301
Good luck with that, Chief.

487
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,829
Sorry, I can't sell alcohol
to people who are enibritted.

488
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,497
- Who are what?
- Enibritted.

489
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,375
- Inebriated?
- Yeah.

490
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,294
I'm not, so promise
you won't get in any trouble.

491
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,256
All right.

492
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:22,635
So, you guys catch
who killed that lady yet?

493
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,096
No. We have not.

494
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,086
Hey. Hey!

495
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,133
- Open the door.
- We're closed.

496
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,510
No, no, no.
It's me, Officer Mustard Stain.

497
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,931
- Open the door. Open the door.
- We're closed!

498
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,433
Sorry, sir. We're closed.

499
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,185
I'm a sir now?

500
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,604
Now I'm a sir. Open the door!

501
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:18,149
Hang up the phone
and open this door right now!

502
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,819
- Please, if you come tomorrow--
- Open the door.

503
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,240
- Sir! You cannot--
- I cannot? I cannot?

504
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,285
Open the motherfucking door
right now!

505
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,828
Okay, okay.

506
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,547
Please, please. What do you want?

507
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:46,594
I want you to look for my shirts.

508
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:49,222
And I would appreciate it
if you fucking tried this time.

509
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,767
Yes, yes. Of course.
Please, let me...

510
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,853
- How many shirts?
- Eight.

511
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,480
Eight.

512
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,651
- And what color?
- All white!

513
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,402
Here we are.

514
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,197
All white shirts, huh? Here we are.

515
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,368
I've got them. They're here.
One second.

516
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,956
Yes. See? White shirts.

517
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,336
Here you go.
More white shirts. That's...

518
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,213
- Here. White.
- Yeah.

519
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,175
White shirts.

520
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,179
- Eight shirts.
- Thank you.

521
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,014
No, no. It's okay.

522
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:35,059
No charge, sir. Our mistake, okay?

523
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:43,860
Thanks.

524
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,902
Testing, testing. One, two.

525
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,446
Testing, testing. One, two.

526
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,573
Good evening.

527
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,158
Hello.

528
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,702
My name is Matt Jamison.

529
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,332
I didn't know your friend very well.

530
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,585
I don't even know
if you considered her a friend,

531
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,630
but she lived here with all of you.

532
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:52,011
I tried to give her a blanket once
on a cold winter day,

533
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,888
but she wouldn't take it.

534
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,641
She was committed to her path.

535
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,645
I don't understand your faith,

536
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:04,732
but I understand commitment
and I respect it.

537
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,443
But we are, all of us,

538
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,279
no matter what we've suffered,
still alive.

539
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,450
We still feel pain and sorrow.

540
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,494
We still feel loss.

541
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,664
We still feel love.

542
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,880
This woman was one of you,
and now she's gone.

543
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,300
I know you cannot speak her name.

544
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,220
I know you cannot say goodbye.

545
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,557
But I ask you at least to let me.

546
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:44,063
If any of you wants to,
I invite you now

547
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,690
to come out and join us.

548
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:54,323
"I lift up my eyes to the hills.

549
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,951
Where does my help come from?

550
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,084
It comes from the Lord.

551
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:09,046
The Maker of Heaven and Earth.

552
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:11,340
He will not let your foot slip.

553
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:15,094
He who watches over you
will not slumber.

554
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,764
Indeed, He--"

555
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:46,542
Disarm system now.

556
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,797
Disarm system now.

557
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:56,844
System deactivated.

558
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,650
Hey.

559
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,946
I heard the alarm.
I wanted to make sure it was you.

560
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,241
- Thanks for setting it.
- Yeah.

561
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,329
- Find your shirts?
- Yeah.

562
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,170
Your mother and I
are getting a divorce.

563
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,427
Okay.

564
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,394
I'm sorry.

565
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,816
It's not your fault.

566
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,740
I love you, honey.

567
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,661
I love you, too.
