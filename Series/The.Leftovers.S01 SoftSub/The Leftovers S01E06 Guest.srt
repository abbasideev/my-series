1
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:06,130
To your knowledge,
did the Departed drink

2
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,841
more than two
alcoholic beverages daily?

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:10,718
Yes.

4
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,306
To your knowledge,
was the Departed born in a hospital?

5
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,643
I think so.

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,356
To your knowledge, did the Departed
ever attempt suicide?

7
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,282
I don't know.

8
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,289
I understand you want to protect
your husband's privacy

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,000
but the more questions
you answer honestly,

10
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,753
the better chance your claim
will be processed.

11
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,675
He told me...

12
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,890
He took some pills once
in high school.

13
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,481
So is that a "yes"?

14
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,820
Yes.

15
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,203
- Hello?
- Hello. Angel?

16
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,289
I'd like to make an appointment.

17
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,106
Hey. I'm Angel.

18
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,317
I'm Nora. Come on in.

19
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,370
Have a seat.

20
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:11,875
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No. Thanks. I'm good.

21
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,795
Nice mattress.
That for us?

22
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,296
That's for me.

23
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,175
You want me to watch you?

24
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,388
No, I want you to shoot me.

25
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,900
No way. No fucking way.
Just...

26
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,736
Two thousand dollars
for two seconds.

27
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,032
Your ad specifically said,
"Nothing is forbidden."

28
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,160
Lady, I fuck people.
I don't kill them.

29
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,038
If I wanted to die,
I wouldn't need you.

30
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,754
I'll talk you through it.

31
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,644
It's Kevlar.

32
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:20,694
All you have to do
is aim right here.

33
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,530
Just above the stomach,
just below my heart.

34
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,201
You've done this before?

35
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,079
Yes.

36
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,042
Why didn't you just get the person
that shot you last time?

37
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,586
She said she wouldn't do it again.

38
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,468
I need another thousand.

39
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:47,971
Okay.

40
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,362
Go ahead.

41
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,840
What if I miss?

42
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,593
You won't.

43
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,896
What happened to you?

44
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,913
Hold it up. Two hands.

45
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,791
All right? Okay?

46
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,089
Aim right here!

47
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,716
Just pull the trigger, okay?

48
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,677
On three.

49
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,054
One...

50
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,266
...two, three!

51
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,185
- Do it.
- Just wait!

52
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,437
- Just do it.
- I can't!

53
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,938
- Just do it!
- I can't!

54
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,356
Do it now!

55
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,970
Nora Jamison Durst,

56
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,764
you have provided
the appropriate documentation,

57
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,268
certifying the respondents' status
as "Departed"?

58
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,019
Yes, I have.

59
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,396
And you wish to dissolve
the marriage

60
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,273
between yourself, the plaintiff

61
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,443
and the respondent,
"Douglas Isaac Durst"?

62
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,321
I do.

63
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,449
And is there any matter of custody
or removal of children,

64
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,785
here named "Jeremy" and "Erin,"

65
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,580
to be resolved
within this application?

66
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,124
My children are also Departed,
Your Honor.

67
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,004
I'm sorry to hear that.

68
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,302
Should the Departed respondent
return,

69
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,304
this will remain binding.

70
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,806
Do you still want to proceed?

71
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,977
My husband was sleeping
with our kids' preschool teacher.

72
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,817
Yes, I'd like to proceed.

73
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,570
All right.

74
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,406
The court hereby grants
a Judgment of Divorce.

75
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,409
While you're here,

76
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,911
would you like to legally revert
to your maiden name?

77
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,539
- It's just another form...
- No, thank you.

78
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,333
I'd like to remain Nora Durst.

79
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,384
Hey.

80
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,928
Hey.

81
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,389
If that's a traffic ticket,
I can get you out of it.

82
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:45,435
Divorce.
I just got myself out of it.

83
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,147
Whoa. Small world.
Me, too.

84
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,107
You're joking.

85
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,694
No, I should have got the hint
when she joined the Guilty Remnant.

86
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:04,537
- Oh, you're not joking.
- No. I don't know how to joke.

87
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,419
- Do you wanna go to Miami?
- What?

88
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,046
I was supposed to go
to this work conference

89
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,090
in Manhattan on Friday
but it's gonna be terrible

90
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:18,093
and I was thinking
maybe Miami instead.

91
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,221
Oh, uh...

92
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,890
I live with my daughter, so I...

93
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,642
Fuck your daughter.

94
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,691
I'm sorry. That--
I am so sorry.

95
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,318
Look...

96
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,165
- Hi, Tracy. Is he in?
- Yes, he is.

97
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,709
Okay, thank you.

98
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,128
Hey.

99
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,675
Come in.

100
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,678
Ma'am, the benefits aren't determ--

101
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,224
Right, but our office has nothing
to say about--

102
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,393
Hello? Ma'am?

103
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,813
I feel like I have
the same conversation

104
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,816
- 80 fucking times a day.
- I have no idea what you mean.

105
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,151
Sit.

106
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:22,574
So, you ready for your panel,
whatever, at DROP?

107
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,033
Yes, sir. They put me on day two,

108
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,453
along with Rhode Island
and Connecticut.

109
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,163
Just don't let them bully you

110
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,498
into taking questions
about the data. All right?

111
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,875
They gave us a pass
last year

112
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,293
but they're gonna want answers
this time.

113
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,836
"I'm sorry, sir or madam,

114
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,672
I'm not qualified to analyze
the data from our questionnaires.

115
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,299
I don't even have access to it
before it goes

116
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,800
to our statisticians in Annapolis."

117
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,677
Oh, shit.

118
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,346
Annapolis. Speaking of.

119
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,600
- What are you doing on 121?
- What?

120
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,643
I just got this email.

121
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,231
"Please inquire ID 42ECN

122
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,735
as to the manner by which
he/she presents Question 121."

123
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,320
What are you doing?

124
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,081
I'm not doing anything.

125
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,460
It says here
you're 100 percent affirmative.

126
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,214
Every single one of your applicants
answers 121 "yes."

127
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:23,092
Isn't that what we're supposed
to be looking for, a pattern?

128
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,553
Everyone else who asks the questions
get plenty of "no's".

129
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,180
It's only a pattern for you.

130
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,141
Maybe you're...

131
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,561
...mentioning what happened to you.

132
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,147
Hm?

133
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,234
You know, before you roll,
just to get people comfortable?

134
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,112
I would never do that.

135
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,742
Okay. Sure.

136
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,370
No, I know.
I'll talk to Annapolis.

137
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,958
Well, enjoy the conference, okay?

138
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,878
Hey.

139
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,341
When you took it...

140
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:08,179
when they asked you 121,
what'd you answer?

141
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,016
I said yes, all three times.

142
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,107
Hello. You've reached
the Durst residence.

143
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,525
Please leave a message.

144
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,986
Hi, Nora.
It's Rick Carson.

145
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,405
Just wanted to thank you again
for being a panelist

146
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,574
at this year's
Departure-Related Occupations

147
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,242
and Practices conference.

148
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,911
Your unique perspective
is really valuable to us.

149
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,539
And a heads-up. We're expecting
a big crowd this year,

150
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,416
so register early.

151
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,877
I'm really looking forward
to meeting you in person.

152
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,558
Look in the Bible.
Look right now. Look today!

153
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,184
They're poisoning us!

154
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,732
Have you seen this?

155
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,782
He's still here.
He's hiding in a basement in Sicily.

156
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,200
Don't trust the Vatican.
The Pope is still here.

157
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,209
Any fucking time now!

158
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,171
Fuck you!
Sons of bitches!

159
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,340
You can't do this to us!

160
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,153
Ms. Durst.

161
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,988
You are staying with us
for two nights?

162
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,281
Mm-hm.

163
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,742
So what's up
with all the people outside?

164
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,535
There's a lot more than last year.

165
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,372
Well, you know, anything about
the Departure for some people.

166
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,499
Can't let it go.

167
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,211
This is the hotel's code of conduct.
Please read carefully and sign.

168
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,255
We had some issues
with your conference last year.

169
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,301
Better cancel the kegger.

170
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,685
Registration is on the third floor.
Enjoy your stay.

171
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,187
- Thank you.
- Okay.

172
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,237
- There you go.
- Hi.

173
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:32,740
- Nora Durst.
- "Durst." Great.

174
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,912
Here's your welcome bag.
Let me look up your badge.

175
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,211
Hey, you want a good cry, read that.
He lost four people on the 14th.

176
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,715
- That's terrible.
- Isn't it?

177
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,094
Looks like somebody
already picked up your badge.

178
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,222
What? I just got here.

179
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,349
Well, somebody
must have picked it up by mistake.

180
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,892
No worries.

181
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,103
This'll get you in
to all the events.

182
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,772
Sorry for the confusion, okay?

183
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,275
Next person?
Hi. Your name, please?

184
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,943
Williams.

185
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,451
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I need my badge.

186
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,661
I'm a panelist tomorrow.

187
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,788
I work for the Department
of Sudden Departure

188
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,290
and I'm a legacy.

189
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,584
I'm sorry for your loss.

190
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,420
I'd like to give you a legacy decal
to go on your guest badge

191
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,130
but we don't have any left.

192
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,381
No, of course. Thank you.

193
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,383
But you understand
that if somebody took my badge...

194
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,260
Well, I'm sure
it was just an innocent mistake.

195
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,220
Why don't you go into the mixer?
Everyone is in there.

196
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,181
I'm sure your badge
is in there, too.

197
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,350
Yes. Next person, please.

198
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,737
They can deny it all they want.
North Korea lost people.

199
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,364
We can't ignore the possibility.

200
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,786
Ooh!

201
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,455
God.
Hey there, easy...

202
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,123
"Guest"?

203
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,709
What's up? Marcus.

204
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,128
I have the most interesting job
at the conference.

205
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,463
And I don't believe in name tags.

206
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,757
If you want to know what I do,
just ask me.

207
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,842
It's a fucking madhouse this year.

208
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,346
You might wanna watch out
for baldy over there.

209
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,098
He's working the room,
asking people,

210
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,642
"Do you really wanna feel this way?"

211
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,352
It's a great fucking pitch.
I give him that.

212
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,938
I mean, who the fuck wants
to feel this way?

213
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,023
I have to go.
It was nice meeting you.

214
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,733
Hey, hey, hey, Guest.

215
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,653
So you're seriously
not gonna ask me what I do?

216
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,365
Okay, what do you do?

217
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:41,160
- You don't wanna know what I do.
- Okay.

218
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,003
We can't deny
the rising instances

219
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,882
of Post-Departure Delusion Disorder.

220
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,095
Or some pundits
have cheekily taken

221
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,931
to calling it
"The Prophet's Dilemma."

222
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:10,273
For most of humankind's existence,
certain individuals have come forth

223
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,778
as self-professed interpreters
of the world's mysteries.

224
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:20,700
But what happens when those
conversations with God go wrong?

225
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,788
Following a catastrophic event
or circumstance,

226
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,250
let alone one
that defies scientific explanation,

227
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:36,215
the incidence of prophetic delusion
rise dramatically.

228
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:41,053
And this isn't just megalomaniacs
who make the news for a week.

229
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:44,599
This is happening to our friends,

230
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:48,811
our neighbors, our own families.

231
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:54,400
This belief that a higher power
is speaking to us,

232
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:59,363
whether through dreams or signs,
even voices,

233
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,242
is a powerful coping mechanism,

234
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:08,623
and if left unchecked,
it is a very dangerous one.

235
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,777
I can wait as long as you want.

236
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,375
I am so sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.

237
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,128
You don't remember me, do you?

238
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,756
No.

239
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,717
Last year, you called me
a heartless bitch

240
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,052
at the farewell party.

241
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,638
I don't know--
No, that wasn't me.

242
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,848
Yes, it was.
Your name is Nora.

243
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,268
You lost your husband and kids.

244
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,690
- You work for Linden-Bix?
- I do.

245
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,529
You said my kids disappeared
because I gave them Frosted Flakes.

246
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,282
No, I mentioned a correlation

247
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,117
between eating cereals high in sugar

248
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,370
and pre-adolescent Departures
in a cocktail conversation.

249
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,082
And then you made me cry
in front of a roomful of people.

250
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,919
I am sorry.
Last year I didn't... I...

251
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,214
I was having a really hard time.

252
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,136
You're doing so much better now.

253
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,105
May I have
your attention, please?

254
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,482
The breakout session
of the Brandenburg Carousel

255
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,943
has been moved to Room 6-B.

256
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,821
6-B in ten minutes
for the Brandenburg Carousel.

257
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,239
Thank you.

258
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,913
I'll take the next one.

259
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,223
Holy shit. It's Guest.

260
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,184
Get your ass in here.

261
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,186
- She's crazy, this one.
- I was just going.

262
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,521
No, no, you're not.
You're going up the elevator.

263
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,399
Get this, get this.

264
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,277
I gave this young lady my best
"you don't wanna know,"

265
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,197
and she still refused to ask me
what I do.

266
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,365
I like her.

267
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,949
Well, guess what, Guest?
We got you now.

268
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,827
You're coming up
to the hospitality suite for drinks.

269
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,121
Thanks, but I have a panel tomorrow,
so I...

270
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,417
- Fuck, Marcus.
- No, no, no.

271
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,336
You have a choice, Guest.

272
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,964
You can play by the rules of this
fucking depressing conference

273
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,424
like everybody else,

274
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,094
or you can go
down the rabbit hole with us.

275
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,970
So what's it gonna be?

276
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,681
You want to spend the next two days
of your life dying,

277
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,476
one panel at a time,
or do you want to live?

278
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,356
Oh, ho, ho! Yes!

279
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,526
Poor Patrick Johansen.

280
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,487
It's a fucking tragedy,
what happened to him, yeah.

281
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,156
- Four! He lost four!
- Did you read the book?

282
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,951
I try not to read anything
that comes in a fucking tote.

283
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,661
Leave that shit to the oranges.

284
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,830
- What's an orange?
- The badges.

285
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,915
You know, some people
have the orange stickers?

286
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,375
The legacies?

287
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,877
Legacies, orphans, survivors.

288
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,504
Whatever they wanna be called
this year.

289
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,423
- It's awful.
- It's a fucking tragedy.

290
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,550
It's like I'm supposed to treat
them better than anyone else?

291
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,510
How many times am I supposed
to say I'm sorry, right?

292
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,638
Right, right.

293
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,685
- You pregnant, Guest?
- What?

294
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,563
Any suicidal thoughts,
history of heart problems?

295
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,816
No.
What is this?

296
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,903
Don't worry.
FDA's gonna approve them next year.

297
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,196
Have fun.

298
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,107
Yo, Guest. Guest!

299
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,902
Why the fuck would you work
for the DSD?

300
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,571
- I like giving people money.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

301
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,365
All those questions you ask,
seriously.

302
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,702
So you really think
you're gonna find out why them?

303
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,370
You're gonna crack the case?

304
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,872
I'm sorry, sir or madam.

305
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,083
I'm not qualified to analyze
the data from our questionnaires.

306
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,585
I don't even have access to it

307
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,087
before it goes to our statisticians
in Annapolis.

308
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,381
It's a fucking scam.

309
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,759
The insurance companies
won't pay out on the Departures

310
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,595
because they're technically
not dead

311
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:19,183
and then your department
created this little questionnaire

312
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,435
so that people won't wanna collect
on their benefits.

313
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:27,566
Hey, look, if your fucking dad
died in a jet ski accident, right,

314
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,861
would you have to answer
150 yes or no questions

315
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,949
about what food he liked
or whether he had anal sex?

316
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,785
We do not ask questions
about anal sex.

317
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:41,455
He's fucking with you, Guest.
He's fucking with you.

318
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,291
- You do an important job.
- No, we don't.

319
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,920
We all do an important job,
all of us.

320
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,631
- Okay. Marcus?
- Yes?

321
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,174
What do you do?

322
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:56,262
You don't wanna know!

323
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,098
You know that's my line.
That's my line.

324
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,141
I say that.
That's my pickup line.

325
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,854
Open.

326
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,737
You sell these?

327
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,656
Forty grand a pop.

328
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,659
Our basic models are cheaper
but they're less convincing.

329
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:27,001
- It looks exactly like you.
- Down to the appendectomy scar.

330
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,213
We take photos of the Departed

331
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,257
and home videos,
whatever they give us,

332
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,218
and then we slowly generate
every little thing

333
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,387
that made them, them.

334
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:42,433
You know, scars, tattoos,
piercings, body hair.

335
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,436
Then, four to six weeks later,
voila.

336
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,104
They got their loved one back.

337
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,940
You make people pay
$40,000 for this?

338
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,859
Oh...

339
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,111
You think I'm soulless?

340
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,615
You think I'm taking advantage
of these poor, grieving people.

341
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,951
But no, no, no, no.
They're coming to us, you know?

342
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,245
And, look at this.

343
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,124
One hundred forty million
bodies disappeared.

344
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:11,462
That's demand.
We are simply providing the supply.

345
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,923
It's pretty amazing,

346
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:19,595
helping someone rebuild
the person they lost, bit by bit.

347
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,766
This, they can bury in the ground.

348
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:27,936
This is here, this, this.
This is real.

349
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,484
I want them to have that.

350
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,071
I want them to have something real.

351
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,618
It's a pretty good pitch.
I'll give you that.

352
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,332
So tell me, Guest, am I soulless?

353
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,710
No.

354
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,255
You have a soul.

355
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,347
Can I kiss you?
I wanna kiss you.

356
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,935
- You're married.
- I am married.

357
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,104
But I still want to kiss you

358
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:14,566
and I believe
you want to kiss me.

359
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,863
Okay.

360
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,620
What?
What are you doing?

361
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,960
You go, girl.

362
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,796
Check this out.

363
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,471
Really?
You're making me jealous.

364
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:48,434
This is horrible, horrible.
Don't look at this.

365
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:54,106
Guest! Guest! Guest!

366
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,526
Guest! Guest! Guest!

367
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,157
- Nora Durst?
- Yes?

368
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,658
Security. Open up.

369
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,995
- Open this door now.
- I'm coming.

370
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,373
Open up.

371
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,129
- Yes?
- Nora Durst?

372
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,006
- Yes?
- You need to pack up your things.

373
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,842
- We're escorting you from the hotel.
- What?

374
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,345
- I don't understand.
- You destroyed hotel property.

375
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,057
- The mirror in the bar?
- I wasn't in the bar.

376
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,101
- Let's go, Ms. Durst.
- Wait! Stop!

377
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,605
You-- Listen to me.
I wasn't in the bar last night.

378
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,484
Someone took my badge.
They're pretending to be me.

379
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,862
See? The conference,
they gave me this

380
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,405
because my badge was stolen.

381
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,407
That's the person
you should be looking for.

382
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,034
They're impersonating me.

383
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,828
I'm not with your conference.
I'm with the hotel.

384
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,330
You signed the code of conduct.
You broke it.

385
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,207
We want you out.
Let's go.

386
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,835
You can't do this.
I didn't do anything wrong.

387
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,546
I have a panel in a few hours.

388
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:00,923
If we see you
on these premises again,

389
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,216
we're gonna call the police.

390
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,068
Morning.

391
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,278
Thanks for printing those out.

392
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,614
I lost my ID at a conference.

393
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,700
I have to get back for a panel
I'm on.

394
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,202
I work for the Department
of Sudden Departures.

395
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,669
This is good.

396
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,531
So, Nora Durst,
what are you doing back in my hotel

397
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:53,035
- with a fake credential and a gun?
- That's not for--

398
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,704
I forgot I had that with me.

399
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,956
I am supposed to be on a panel
this morning.

400
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:04,087
So, why did you throw a bottle
at the mirror behind the hotel bar?

401
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,966
I wasn't in the bar.
Someone is impersonating me.

402
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:11,094
No offense, but who would
wanna pretend to be you?

403
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,097
I don't know. There are a lot
of sick people out there.

404
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,517
Maybe somebody's doing it
for attention. I...

405
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,395
My husband and two children
are Departed,

406
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:23,357
and that sort of thing,
it gets a lot of sympathy.

407
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,111
Jesus, your whole family?

408
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,782
What are the odds?

409
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,701
One in 128,000.

410
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,460
Okay, let's try this on for size.
I know how these conferences can be.

411
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,545
Away from home, new people.

412
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,591
So maybe things got out of hand,
one drink too many--

413
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,884
- No.
- No, no...

414
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,552
- Listen to me.
- Maybe...

415
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:57,641
...you did go down to that bar
and things got out of control.

416
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:02,896
Maybe you've been under
a lot of stress and you just...

417
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,149
...lost your grip on things.

418
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:10,654
- Is that possible?
- No, that is not possible.

419
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,364
Please, just...

420
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,951
She is probably on my panel
right now.

421
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,577
The other panelists don't know me.

422
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,204
She could walk onstage
with my badge

423
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:22,833
and nobody would stop her,
so please.

424
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,424
All right.

425
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,926
If I walk you down
to that conference room

426
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,721
and there's no one there
pretending to be you,

427
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,473
then you leave this hotel
and I never see your face again.

428
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,435
- Deal?
- Deal.

429
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,196
I'm sorry.
The session's already started.

430
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,573
We're just gonna be a minute.

431
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,284
Next we have Marquee Jackson
from Vermont.

432
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,661
Beside him,
we have Olivia Livingstone

433
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,663
from the Rhode Island branch
of the DSD,

434
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,749
which has
the highest participation rate

435
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:06,293
in the benefit program
in the country.

436
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,713
Next, we have Jonathan Van Meter,
also from Vermont,

437
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,091
and beside him,
Nora Durst from New York.

438
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,635
Mrs. Durst
is also a triple legacy.

439
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,555
Well, fuck.

440
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,475
I need two guys
to the Waterloo Room right now.

441
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,352
...liaison with the Canadian
Departure Census,

442
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,937
and he'll talk about
how they collect

443
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,522
their data up north.

444
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,776
And finally, Daniel McCallum
from Connecticut.

445
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,527
Daniel served
on the Review Committee...

446
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,072
Excuse me.
I have a question.

447
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,826
- We haven't started the panel yet.
- I have a question for Nora Durst.

448
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,828
We will open the floor
to questions--

449
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,497
I am not Nora Durst.

450
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,921
I have been watching you people
for the last two days,

451
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,882
listening to you
and you are all blind.

452
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,635
- Puppets.
- Ma'am.

453
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,887
The Department
of the Sudden Departure

454
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,847
is an elaborate smokescreen

455
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:04,142
to give the public the illusion
of progress. Excuse me.

456
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,603
Their questionnaires
are sent to incinerators

457
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,189
- outside of Tallahassee, Florida.
- Shut this off!

458
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,650
Their benefit payments
are a way to silence us all.

459
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:16,363
In 2005, the Israeli Mossad
was experimenting with a plasma ray

460
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:21,201
that could target all human matter
and leave almost no residue.

461
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,788
Where are your experts
and panels on that?

462
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,596
- Another martini, dirty.
- Thank you.

463
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,557
Let me give you my card.
You can keep it open.

464
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,851
Manager says whatever you need,
it's on the house.

465
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,481
What'd they do,

466
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,567
if the drinks are on them

467
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,777
because you've been
seriously wronged?

468
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:59,531
Maybe they're just rewarding me
for being a loyal customer.

469
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,867
- Nah.
- Nah?

470
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,660
Isn't the way the world works.

471
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,621
Indeed it is not.

472
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,959
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Would you mind signing this for me?

473
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:14,004
Absolutely.
Should I make it out to anyone?

474
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,839
- To Gail.
- "To Gail." Sure.

475
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,049
- Please.
- No problem.

476
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,096
- God Bless.
- Thank you.

477
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,639
Take care.

478
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,101
What?

479
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,354
I hear it's amazing, your book.

480
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,440
The writing's so-so.

481
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,318
People respond to the idea.

482
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,653
Why no question mark?

483
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,699
"What's Next," period.
I mean, no offense,

484
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,826
but it's not like
you know what's next.

485
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,454
Exactly.
No one knows.

486
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,372
But we can't spend our lives
waiting around

487
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,291
for something that may never come.

488
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,835
Back.

489
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,089
- Sorry?
- Something that may never come back.

490
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,639
You lost someone?

491
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,600
I did.

492
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,231
You know, my daughter,
about a year ago,

493
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:18,276
she was out in our backyard,
chasing around some of her friends

494
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,986
and she was laughing.

495
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,950
Then she saw me watching her
and she looked guilty,

496
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,994
like she wasn't sure
if it was okay to be happy.

497
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,415
But this, what we've experienced...

498
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,835
...it isn't grief.

499
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,755
It's never-ending.

500
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,092
Ambiguous loss.

501
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:47,180
If my eight-year-old can find
happiness again...

502
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,100
...why can't the rest of us?

503
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,605
Bullshit.

504
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,150
- I'm sorry?
- No, you're not sorry.

505
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,820
Sorry people
don't write fucking books.

506
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,947
Wait a minute. Ma'am,
if I've offended you in any way,

507
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,116
- that was not my--
- "Ambiguous loss"?

508
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,244
What is ambiguous
about your family being gone?

509
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,830
Well, and you must know
because you lost what, four?

510
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,165
You count your parents in that?
What were they, in their 70s?

511
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,837
You sit there and tell me a story
about your daughter.

512
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:23,133
I lost everyone.
I lost everything.

513
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,928
You fucking fraud.
You fucking liar!

514
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,263
You're not in pain.

515
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,514
Because if you were in pain,

516
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,933
you would know
there is no moving on.

517
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,643
There is no happiness.

518
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,396
"What's next"?
What's fucking next?

519
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:40,150
Nothing is next!
Nothing!

520
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,429
Evening.

521
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,853
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

522
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,023
Excuse me. Miss, miss, miss.
I'm sorry to bother you.

523
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,984
I saw you back in the bar
and I heard what you said.

524
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,571
And I just wanted to ask you,
do you wanna feel this way?

525
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,241
Yeah, I want to feel this way.
Fuck off.

526
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,911
You're right, you know,
about Johansen.

527
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,205
What? Excuse me.

528
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,749
He's not in pain.
He's a fraud, just like you said,

529
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,001
and I can prove it.

530
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,672
How?

531
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,376
Come on.

532
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,218
This is Ray.
He'll take your payment information.

533
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,638
Payment for what?

534
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,891
Last year Patrick Johansen,

535
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,809
he walked through doorways
just like that.

536
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:23,271
If you want to know what happened,
it's $1000.

537
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,319
What do you mean,
"What happened"?

538
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,740
You on PayPal?
If not, I can get you set up.

539
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,000
- I have an account.
- Go ahead and pull it up.

540
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,212
You authorize the amount.

541
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:11,277
Thank you.
Now right this way.

542
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,365
Go ahead.

543
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,578
Come on.

544
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,643
This is Wayne.
Holy Wayne.

545
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,903
I don't think
she's heard of me.

546
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,406
No, she's here about
Patrick Johansen.

547
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,533
Who?

548
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,453
The one who came to you
just before you left for the ranch?

549
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,373
Lost most of his family?

550
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,126
- He ended up writing a book?
- Oh, right.

551
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,086
Right. I didn't read it.

552
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,923
I assume he didn't mention me.

553
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,637
Why would he mention you?

554
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,267
Because I took his pain from him.

555
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,069
What are you doing?

556
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:38,823
What's your name, love?

557
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,118
- Nora.
- Nora.

558
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,370
Nora, I don't give a shit about you.

559
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:47,290
I've already got your money
and I'm fucking exhausted.

560
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,792
You've lost someone, yes?

561
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,799
Someones.

562
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,683
And you believe
that you will always feel that pain.

563
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,271
And if it starts to slip away,
you...

564
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,067
...you seek it out again, don't you?

565
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,698
You won't let it kill you
but you won't...

566
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,243
...kill yourself.

567
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,124
For whoever is joined
with all of the living,

568
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,835
there is hope.

569
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:39,842
Surely, a live dog is better
than a dead lion.

570
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,554
Hope.

571
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,684
It's your weakness.

572
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:51,729
You want it gone
because you don't deserve it.

573
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,445
Nora...

574
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,449
...you do deserve hope.

575
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,333
I've seen my own death
and it's coming upon me very soon,

576
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,378
so this is your one chance,
your only chance,

577
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,630
and the question remains the same.

578
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,342
Do you want to feel this way?

579
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,765
- No.
- No.

580
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,442
Then let me take it from you.

581
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,954
Will I forget them?

582
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,334
Never.

583
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,995
- You have a rewards card with us?
- Sure, I got it right here.

584
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,459
- Thanks.
- All right.

585
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,102
Hello, you've reached
the Durst residence.

586
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,520
Please leave a message.

587
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:42,108
Nora. Hi, it's Matt.

588
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,361
I know I keep calling.
I should just...

589
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:50,366
I don't know how many
different ways I can apologize. I...

590
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,452
I've made some changes in my life.

591
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,247
I see things more clearly now.

592
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,460
We're family. I love you.

593
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,506
Message saved.

594
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,397
Hey.

595
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:26,402
- Hi.
- I looked up your address.

596
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,195
Actually easier to get
than your phone number,

597
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,447
believe it or not.

598
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,365
Did you want to come in or...

599
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,535
No, actually, I'm on duty.
I...

600
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,495
...just wanted to stop by
and tell you

601
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,164
I don't take it personally.

602
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:42,001
You know, when you said,
"Fuck your daughter."

603
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,961
I was having an off day.

604
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,090
- Divorces will do that to you.
- They will.

605
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,053
Anyway, I just wanted you to know

606
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,764
that I wanna get out here
all the time, just go,

607
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:59,435
but when you said that
about Miami,

608
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,187
it sounded pretty good.

609
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:05,900
Maybe we should do dinner

610
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,611
or something first sometime?

611
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:12,740
- I would love that.
- Good.

612
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,913
All right. But you should know,
though, I'm a fucking mess.

613
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,374
- Thanks for the heads-up.
- All right.

614
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,709
- Bye.
- Bye.

615
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,801
To your knowledge,
did the Departed

616
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:35,429
regularly use aerosol hair spray
and/or deodorant?

617
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,557
Yeah, I think so.

618
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:44,271
In your opinion, was the Departed
a charitable person?

619
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,399
Yes.

620
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,697
In your opinion,
was the Departed a religious person?

621
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,240
Yes.

622
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:04,750
In your opinion, do you believe
the Departed is in a better place?

623
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,637
No.
