1
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,506
You like Rice Krispies treats?

2
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,010
Suit yourselves.

3
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,363
Sorry about the dog.

4
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,866
Believe it or not,
it used to be a lot worse.

5
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,786
What's his name?

6
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,789
Nothing's really stuck yet.

7
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,542
You have a dog?

8
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,295
I used to. His name was Bubba.

9
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,922
- Bubba?
- Bubba.

10
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,132
Oh.

11
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,057
So, Miss Durst--

12
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,225
Nora.

13
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:32,062
Nora, you do the questionnaire thing
for the government, right?

14
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,272
Uh-huh.

15
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:37,734
So you, like, ask stuff
to find out what they had in common,

16
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:41,238
everybody who poofed?

17
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,823
That's the idea.

18
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,784
So do people, like, freak out?

19
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,037
What do you mean?

20
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,457
Well, I just mean,
if I lost somebody

21
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,044
and had to answer personal questions
to get a benefit check,

22
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,629
I'd probably go mental.

23
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,797
No offense.

24
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,508
I've never seen anybody go mental.

25
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,261
They're sad, but they're safe.

26
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,306
Then why do you carry a gun?

27
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,601
- What?
- She has a gun in her purse.

28
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,770
Right?

29
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,273
What makes you think she has--?

30
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:21,320
Actually, Jill, I used to have a gun,
but I don't need it anymore.

31
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,281
- Why'd you need it before?
- Jill.

32
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,450
It made me feel better.

33
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,452
- Then why'd you get rid of it?
- Jill.

34
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,662
- What?
- Enough.

35
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,622
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

36
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,959
I just want to know
how she got better.

37
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,546
Hey! Nora's a guest in our house.

38
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,050
- I'm asking our guest a question.
- Then cut the shit, Jill.

39
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,219
Go ahead. Take a look.

40
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,266
- Nora, you don't have--
- It's okay, really.

41
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,144
Go ahead.

42
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,755
- Apologize.
- She doesn't have to.

43
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,507
She does have to.

44
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,766
- Sorry.
- No worries.

45
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,029
I think she really likes me.

46
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,409
She said, she was
looking forward to it. I swear.

47
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,870
Now that I've been inspected
for fire arms, the worst is over.

48
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:59,084
Don't go back in and fight with her.
That's what she wants.

49
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,878
I mean, sorry.
She started it, and--

50
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,713
That's very mature of you.

51
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,472
It'll get better.

52
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,059
How?

53
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,246
I don't know, but it will.

54
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,594
Jesus! You are taking a nap?
Come on.

55
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,394
She's still out.

56
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,493
THE LEFTOVERS

57
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,303
Morning.

58
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,806
Is my dad downstairs?

59
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,641
Nope.

60
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,769
I guess you must have scared him off
to her place.

61
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,813
Bang, bang.

62
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,535
You don't fucking know me!
You motherfucker!

63
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,203
You don't fucking know me!

64
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,622
- Fuck you!
- Megan.

65
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,209
Fuck you, you fuck!
You fucking fuck!

66
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:55,213
You! How fucking dare you?

67
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,881
You don't know me!

68
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,427
You're everywhere! Leave us alone!

69
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,346
- Megan.
- Fuck you!

70
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,849
Megan. Come home.

71
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,186
- Megan!
- Shut your fucking mouth, you fuck!

72
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,397
- Come home, Megan.
- Fuck you!

73
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,274
Come home. Megan!

74
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,112
Fuck. Do you know what he's doing?
Do you know?

75
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,699
This is about me!
This is my fucking mother!

76
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,076
My mother!
He's been talking to her friends!

77
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,579
He has one of everyone on all of us!

78
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,872
He can't do that!

79
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,832
He can't just fucking come here
and do that!

80
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,709
You can't let him!

81
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:57,609
Fine. Fine.
Let's see what Patti says.

82
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,700
I think she's playing possum.

83
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,590
You are playing possum, gorgeous?

84
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,931
Well, maybe you hit her
a little too hard, huh?

85
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,194
What the hell's wrong with you?

86
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,322
- What happened last night?
- What?

87
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,451
I need you to tell me everything
that happened last night.

88
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,328
Why?

89
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,164
I don't think I remember.

90
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,500
You don't think you remember?

91
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,465
This was all your idea, asshole.

92
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,431
What do you remember?

93
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,687
I remember getting into bed.

94
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,607
Oh, come on.
What, are you saying....?

95
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,652
What,
that you're fucking sleepwalking?

96
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,238
Just tell me.

97
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,241
Well, Kevin....

98
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,914
Apparently you got out of bed
and showed up at the bar.

99
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,000
And we had a couple,

100
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,836
and you insisted
on giving me a lift home.

101
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,798
At which point,
we passed our lady friend in there.

102
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,259
When she looked up,

103
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,261
she gave you that
"go fuck yourself" smile.

104
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,763
Next thing I know,
you were out, grabbing her.

105
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,852
Nothing like a spontaneous abduction
to get the heart fucking pumping,

106
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,063
and, boom,
we are off to Cairo, New York.

107
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,275
We're in Cairo?

108
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,277
Well, you gave me directions!

109
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,363
You said that you--

110
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,783
You used to come to camp up here
when you were little.

111
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,870
You snuck off to the cabin
to smoke cigarettes.

112
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,543
Why? Why would you do this with me?

113
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,880
Because we're friends.

114
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,257
Before last night,

115
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,343
when was the last time
we saw each other?

116
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,220
I don't know.
Couple weeks back, you know.

117
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,889
When we made the bet.

118
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,559
Oh, Jesus.

119
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,898
We caught a dog and
you bet that you could civilize him.

120
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,399
You win,
I stop shooting the fuckers.

121
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,276
I win, you give me a dollar.

122
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,904
Yeah, I will collect that dollar,

123
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,156
so don't try using
this amnesia bullshit to back out.

124
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,866
No, I don't have fucking amnesia.

125
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,952
Well, then what the fuck
have you got?

126
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,497
Shit.

127
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,167
Oh, fuck. Jesus.

128
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,473
You're okay?

129
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:26,150
I think things got
a little out of control last night.

130
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,778
- Jesus, Chief. What the hell--?
- Shut the fuck up.

131
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,328
I shouldn't have done this to you.

132
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,959
But you kept
fucking pushing me, Patti,

133
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,962
and I reacted.

134
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,132
So I'm gonna let you go,

135
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,552
and we're gonna get in the truck
and I'm gonna drive you home.

136
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:57,473
And all the bullshit up until now,
we're gonna call it even.

137
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,267
- We're gonna forget that it--
- Shut up!

138
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,190
I don't forget.

139
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,987
Well, well.

140
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,489
It speaks.

141
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,826
Gosh, you're so friendly now.

142
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,162
Tell me...

143
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,290
Am I still a fat,
heartless cunt?

144
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,167
That's what he said, right?

145
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,753
That is my recollection, yes.

146
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,840
Well, Kevin, that is a kind offer.

147
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,260
Take me home, give a polite
little beep as you drive off.

148
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,054
But you should know

149
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,890
that I have every intention
of reporting you

150
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,100
to the actual authorities.

151
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,520
I will tell them that I was abducted
off the street,

152
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,857
and I will identify my attackers.

153
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:54,363
And they will take your job,
and then they will take your child.

154
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,701
You want to undo this,
but I simply cannot allow that.

155
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:03,372
So, you're just gonna
have to batten down the hatches

156
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,959
and finish what you started here,
my friend.

157
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,048
Now get me a fucking cigarette!

158
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:18,721
However, when allied tanks
arrived on the outskirts of Daafeed,

159
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,224
the mass grave was empty.

160
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,184
The officers described a....

161
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:32,068
How long do I have to wait here?
Why are you so mad?

162
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,112
What was I supposed to do?

163
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,738
I mean, if we don't stand up to him,

164
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,907
then he's just gonna keep on
coming at us.

165
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,743
Why not?

166
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:44,413
They fucking hit us,
they spit in our faces,

167
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,249
they spray us with hoses.

168
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,050
Of course.

169
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,480
Please.

170
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,026
This is my sister, Nora,
my wife, Mary.

171
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,612
This is Laurie and Megan.

172
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,948
- She's the one who attacked you?
- It's okay.

173
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,994
Megan's mother passed away
on October 13th,

174
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,330
one day before the Departure.

175
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:11,500
She has a right to be angry.
Her grief was hijacked.

176
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,399
I accept your apology.

177
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,860
She's not sorry.

178
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,364
She's here. It's a start.

179
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,997
I'm not giving up on you.

180
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,541
Thank you for coming by.

181
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,507
Hey, Laurie.

182
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,550
If you're giving out apologies,

183
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,636
I have a suggestion
for your next stop.

184
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,806
I had dinner
with your daughter last night.

185
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,392
You might wanna drop by
and write her a note, too.

186
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,740
So, Garvey's totally
just staring her down,

187
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:28,327
and she's all like, "You're there
sitting in my mom's chair,

188
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,539
eating my dad's delicious chicken?
Uh-uh"

189
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,040
It wasn't my mom's chair.

190
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,835
Okay, and Nora,
who I know on a first-name basis,

191
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:39,588
by the way,
she's all like, "Go ahead.

192
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,924
I don't give a shit.
Look in my purse."

193
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:45,428
And I'm like, damn, is she bluffing?

194
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,638
Because obviously
Garvey's supposed to just be like,

195
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,599
"Oh, sorry, no, forget it."
But no, fuck that.

196
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,602
Garvey grabs her purse,
looks in that shit, and....

197
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,316
No gun!

198
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,486
- I don't get it.
- Why does it matter?

199
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,654
Because she's lying.

200
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,032
It wasn't in her purse,
but she still has it.

201
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,075
- How do you know?
- Because I know.

202
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,285
What's that got to do with the gun?

203
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,288
Absolutely nothing.
Garvey is cock-blocking her dad.

204
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,124
- She was pretending.
- Pretending what?

205
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,461
To be okay.
She lost her entire family.

206
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,339
Just so you know,

207
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:26,927
it is possible for some people
to be okay, Jill.

208
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,223
Are you okay, Aimee?

209
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,644
- Okay.
- I am fucking fantastic.

210
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:36,812
And I got to say,

211
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,148
I think your dad would be, too,
if you'd just fucking let him.

212
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,193
Guys, let's just calm down.
Come on.

213
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,986
Did you fuck him?

214
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,238
- Whoa, hey.
- What?

215
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,991
- Let's play ping-pong, okay?
- Yeah. Right?

216
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,493
Did you?

217
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,662
Did you fuck my dad?

218
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,043
Yeah, Jill.

219
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,212
I did.

220
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,048
I fucked your dad.

221
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,678
And I felt really bad about it.

222
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,349
So I was like,
"Hey, Mr. Garvey, this is so wrong."

223
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,726
But he was like, "Hey.

224
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:21,399
Let's stop pretending to be okay
because no one is okay."

225
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,359
And he was totally right.

226
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,279
And he was so hard, Jill.

227
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:32,159
So I fucked the shit out of him
on top of a pile of guns.

228
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:35,287
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you!

229
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,186
Other pocket.

230
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,909
If I cut you loose,
you gonna behave?

231
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,996
Jesus.
Chief, she just spit in your face.

232
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,416
You want her to bite
your goddamn nose off, too?

233
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,334
Certainly a risk.

234
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:43,022
- You want one? Help yourself.
- I don't smoke.

235
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,443
I seem to recall
Laurie telling me that you did.

236
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,283
I quit.

237
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,124
Who do you report to?

238
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,126
- Sorry?
- Your organization.

239
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,544
Your fucking cult.

240
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,631
- Where do you get your orders?
- We don't take orders.

241
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,090
Bullshit.

242
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,968
People have fucking chapters
all over the country.

243
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,303
Okay, I'm sorry,

244
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,681
but you brought me here
and strapped me up,

245
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,142
so you could ask me
about my organization?

246
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,228
Just answer the fucking question.

247
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,146
And who might you be, sir?

248
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,650
This ain't working out, Chief.

249
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:31,862
Reason I ask is because I've had
some experience in research.

250
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,073
And most people,

251
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:38,702
you can find out things about them
with no trouble at all.

252
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,664
But you, dog killer.

253
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:46,669
No driver's license, no records,
no anything.

254
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
So I don't know.

255
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,839
You may be able to shed some light
about your friend here?

256
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:54,510
But as far as I can tell,
he's a ghost.

257
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,682
I prefer to think of myself
as a guardian angel.

258
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,725
Well, shit.

259
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,354
I think I just heard a bell ring.

260
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,782
Word with you outside, Chief?

261
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:21,620
Something tells me you're about
to get some excellent advice.

262
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,379
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What?

263
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,880
I signed up
for this little adventure

264
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,633
under the countenance of strong
and decisive leadership.

265
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,720
But now, lo and behold,
that leader is now gone.

266
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,638
And the man currently residing
in his skin

267
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,474
clearly has no fucking idea
what is happening in there.

268
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,896
When we did this last night...

269
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,275
...what did I say I wanted?

270
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,737
You said it was time to end it.

271
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,906
I don't wanna hurt her.

272
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,410
Oh, yes, you do.

273
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,913
After what she took from your town?

274
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,209
From your family?

275
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,463
There have to be consequences.

276
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:23,182
Look. Chief, I get it.

277
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,645
You tried every way you could
to stop these fucks,

278
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,440
but you could only get so far
because you are a good man.

279
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,278
So how about you go back
to the truck

280
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,783
and get comfortable,
close your eyes?

281
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,453
Because I need to talk
to the other guy.

282
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,791
There's only fucking me!

283
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,977
- Dude, this is a bad idea.
- Up.

284
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,813
- Right.
- I mean it, you guys.

285
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,315
- I don't think we should do this.
- My right. Nope. Your right.

286
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,483
- Sorry.
- Got it.

287
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,068
All right, stop.
Click it, Garvey.

288
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,861
- I got it.
- Right.

289
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,834
- What the hell, man?
- We're looking for a gun.

290
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,086
Nobody keeps the gun
in the crisper, dude.

291
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,256
- That's where I would hide it.
- What if she comes home?

292
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:41,009
Then she'll go right for the gun.
Boom. Mystery solved.

293
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,887
That is the dumbest thing
I have ever heard in my life.

294
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,098
- Oh, my God.
- Shut up, Scott.

295
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,385
I still don't get it.

296
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:27,055
If the lady who lost her family
is, like, lying about the gun,

297
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,975
then, like, no one
can ever be okay again.

298
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,729
Do you think Aimee
was really fucking Garvey's dad?

299
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,774
Probably. Dude is ripped.

300
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,736
- Oh, shit.
- What?

301
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,658
Bulletproof vest, yo.

302
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,577
Jackpot.

303
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,225
- Hit me, bitch!
- No way.

304
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,852
Do it, chicken shit!

305
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:42,190
- Motherfucker!
- Let's get out of here.

306
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,860
- Why? What about the gun?
- Doesn't matter.

307
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,866
Dude, vest. Go.

308
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,916
Wait up!

309
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,511
Hello, you've reached Nora Durst.
Please leave a message.

310
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,390
Nora, it's me, Kevin.

311
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:26,276
Um, I only have one bar,
so I hope you can hear me.

312
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,614
I did something stupid.

313
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,241
Think I fucked up.

314
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,746
I don't know
what's happening to me.

315
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,458
So can you call me
when you get the message?

316
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,419
And that's just, I...

317
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,174
I need you.

318
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,236
No. No.

319
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,868
Fucking no!

320
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,832
Fuck!

321
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,211
Fuck! Fuck!

322
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,671
Fuck!

323
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,678
Fuck! Fuck!

324
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,934
Fuck.

325
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,951
You're okay.

326
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,663
You're okay.

327
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,875
You're okay.

328
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,388
Did you take your nap?

329
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,974
Fuck this. We're leaving.

330
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,559
- Her word against ours.
- No.

331
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,729
Whoa there, Chief. Just hold on.
Just give it a minute, okay?

332
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,774
- What?
- Situation is taking care of itself.

333
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,945
- What did you do?
- What? Hey, hey! Goddamn it!

334
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,572
Jesus.

335
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,261
Don't fight it, Chief.
Just give it a minute.

336
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,596
Just let her go. It's what you want.

337
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,813
Just let her go, man.
Just let her go.

338
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,985
Fuck!

339
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,495
I fucking wanted to help you.

340
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,958
Now you are on your own, Chief.

341
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:17,299
Oh, shut the fuck up. I tried.

342
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,772
- You okay?
- Shh.

343
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,235
What, you want me to write it down?
I'm just asking if you're all right.

344
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,325
Can you believe Nora fucking Durst?

345
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,660
She just had to say something,
right?

346
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,370
You know what? Fuck her.

347
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,830
What does she know about
your daughter?

348
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,207
She doesn't know fucking shit.

349
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,921
I wish I could see her face
on Memorial Day.

350
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,966
Shh!

351
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,869
Patti sent you?

352
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,718
You got something for me?

353
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,154
We're good?

354
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,210
Okay. Unhitch it.

355
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,089
You people are some sick fucks.

356
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,973
Nora, it's me, Kevin.

357
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,967
Disarm system now.

358
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,887
Disarm system now.

359
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:36,349
System deactivated.

360
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,896
Where are you going?

361
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,776
Dorfman said I could crash there
for a while.

362
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,739
Cool.

363
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,706
I hope you feel better.

364
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,419
I'm fine.

365
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,597
Thanks for letting me stay.

366
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,334
Go.

367
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,754
Go.

368
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,300
Can I stay here?

369
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,420
Boy, are you fucked.

370
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,052
Tell me.

371
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,847
You're wondering
if I have a sense of debt to you

372
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,682
for saving my life?

373
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:33,563
Maybe I'll change my mind
about decimating yours.

374
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,986
- But you won't?
- No, I won't.

375
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:45,950
Oh, it's a pickle.
Can't let me go, won't let me die.

376
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,870
Oh, what to do, Kevin?

377
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,331
What to fucking do?

378
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,210
What do you want?

379
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,922
I want you to understand.

380
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,926
Understand what?

381
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:09,390
You ever think about the 14th,
14th of October?

382
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:14,103
The Great Vanishing?
The Sudden Departure?

383
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,981
The clusterfuck of the modern era?

384
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:21,235
When's the last time
you ever really thought about it?

385
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,239
- I don't.
- Me?

386
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,451
I think about it
every fucking waking moment.

387
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,455
I mean, come on.
What else is there to think about?

388
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:37,585
So you know where they went,
what happened?

389
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,463
It doesn't matter what happened.

390
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:45,009
But the difference
between you and me...

391
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:49,639
...is that I accept that it did.

392
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:53,351
And while you push it aside,
while you ignore it,

393
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,938
we strip ourselves of everything
that distracts us from it.

394
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:02,527
We strip away the colorful diversions
that keep us from remembering.

395
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,949
We strip away attachment,

396
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:14,622
fear, and love,
and hatred and anger...

397
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,251
...until we are...

398
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,795
...erased.

399
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,465
Until we are a blank slate.

400
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,135
We're living reminders
of what you try

401
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:32,473
so desperately to forget.

402
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,228
And we are ready,

403
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:43,067
and we are waiting
because it's not gonna be long now.

404
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,990
Now I know why
you don't fucking talk.

405
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,410
Got to hand it to you, Patti.

406
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,913
That is such an impressive line
of fucking bullshit.

407
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,418
Well, Laurie obviously
disagrees with you.

408
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:04,005
Laurie didn't join you
to become a living fucking reminder.

409
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,216
Then why did she?

410
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,344
Because I failed her.

411
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,889
Oh.

412
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,808
You think she came to us
because of you.

413
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,854
Because of what you did
with your dirty dick.

414
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:28,154
Yes, Kevin, there was a time
I told Laurie everything.

415
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,909
And then there was a time
she told me everything.

416
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,789
But she came to me because
I could offer her something...

417
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,042
...that you could not.

418
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,711
Purpose.

419
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,759
That's all any of us want now,
every single one of us.

420
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:54,639
Not answers, not love.

421
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,435
Just a reason to exist.

422
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,604
Something to live for.

423
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,400
Something to die for.

424
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,405
Did Gladys have a purpose?

425
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,575
Ah, you remember her name.

426
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,243
Of course I remember
her fucking name.

427
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:18,746
Well, Kevin, that was the point.

428
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:24,460
That woman was brutally murdered,
death by 100 stones.

429
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:28,255
And now, she can't be forgotten.

430
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:34,971
Did you murder her?

431
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,727
She was okay with it.

432
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:51,821
And when Laurie's time comes,
she will be okay with it, too.

433
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:56,701
And it's coming, so soon.

434
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:58,953
And you are all ready.

435
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:03,833
All you need is just a little push.

436
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:10,131
You want me to kill you.

437
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:13,384
Kevin, you can't kill me.
You don't have the fucking balls.

438
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,762
I want you to commit.

439
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:19,765
I want you to finish
what you started.

440
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,101
I want you to go all the way.

441
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:25,896
I want you to say you understand.

442
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,482
Understand what?

443
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:32,403
What happened, what's happening?

444
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,863
To me.

445
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,490
To you.

446
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:45,166
Oh, vanity of sleep,

447
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:51,630
hope, dream, endless desire,

448
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:58,012
the horses of disaster
plunge through the heavy clay.

449
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:03,684
Beloved, let your eyes half close

450
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:06,979
and your heart beat over my heart.

451
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:11,734
And your hair fall over my breast,

452
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:16,530
drowning love's lonely hour
in deep twilight of rest.

453
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:25,164
And hiding their tossing manes
and tumultuous feet.

454
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,711
Kevin.

455
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,548
Kevin.

456
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,094
Kevin Garvey.

457
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:46,519
You don't have to hide from me.

458
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:56,046
You're going home.

459
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:04,763
You're not gonna tell anybody
what I did to you.

460
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,767
Because I'll fucking tell them.

461
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:13,564
If I lose my fucking job...

462
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,985
...so fucking be it.

463
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,822
But I am not gonna lose my mind

464
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:26,827
listening to the words
coming out of your fucking mouth.

465
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,209
No, Patti.

466
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,170
No.

467
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,007
I don't understand you.

468
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,439
Kevin.

469
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,944
You do understand.

470
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,535
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God!

471
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,371
Oh, God!

472
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:12,206
Oh, God!

473
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,000
Oh, God!

474
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:21,131
What the fuck did you do?
What the fuck did you do?

475
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,055
You...

476
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,559
...understand.
