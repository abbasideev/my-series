1
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,943
Christine.

2
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,320
Christine.

3
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,616
Christine!

4
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,164
She's hungry.

5
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:24,703
He's never coming for us, is he?
Wayne?

6
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,332
I don't know.

7
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,964
I should have known he was a liar
when he said I was special.

8
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,013
Look at me.
Hey.

9
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,350
I'm going to take care of you
just like I promised.

10
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,559
Okay? I'll get a job.

11
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,312
I'll find us a place to stay,
all of us.

12
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,028
We don't need him.
Christine, we don't need Wayne.

13
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,865
I know.

14
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,206
She's wet.

15
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,418
- Do you want me to--
- No, no, I've got her.

16
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,110
Excuse me, young man.

17
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,737
Young man?

18
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,658
- Can I help you?
- What?

19
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:48,078
Is there anything I can do
to help you?

20
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,958
- No, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

21
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,876
Yeah.

22
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,754
It's my ride.

23
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,925
God bless you.

24
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:08,849
Hey. You just go around
asking people if they need help?

25
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,059
Yeah.

26
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,603
Does anyone ever say yes?

27
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,523
All the time.

28
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,133
Christine!

29
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,804
Christine! Christine! Christine!

30
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:52,809
No, no, no.
Hey, hey, it's okay.

31
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:56,646
Christine! Christine!

32
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,736
Christine!

33
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,241
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.

34
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,329
Christine!

35
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,829
Sorry.
I got lost coming off the highway.

36
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,539
I tried to call you.

37
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,211
The battery on my phone died.

38
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,548
Where is she?

39
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,903
What are you doing?

40
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,407
I'm closing her eyes.

41
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,493
- You can't touch her.
- Why not?

42
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,247
Because she's--
It's a fucking crime scene.

43
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,667
You told me on the phone
she did this to herself.

44
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,627
No one's going to
fucking believe that.

45
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,047
I believe it.

46
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,010
I brought her here.

47
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,389
I beat her.
I tied her up.

48
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:56,019
And then you tried to let her go
but she wouldn't let that happen.

49
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,187
She wanted you to pay.

50
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,192
She knew if she did this
that it'd hurt you.

51
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,280
Because you're a good man, Kevin.

52
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,168
If you touch her...

53
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,007
...we're in this together.

54
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,149
Then let's be in it.

55
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,823
I have shovels in my trunk.

56
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,611
Wait.

57
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,823
I, uh...

58
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,325
I marked a passage.

59
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:36,995
Okay.

60
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,042
- What?
- You should read it.

61
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,130
- No. No, thanks.
- Why not?

62
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,466
Because I don't believe it, Matt.

63
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,469
I'm sure she didn't, either.

64
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,855
Did you ask for my help, Kevin?

65
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,400
Yes.

66
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,402
This is me helping.

67
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,955
Just the highlighted part.

68
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,833
It can get wordy.

69
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,925
"If I go to the East,
He is not there.

70
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,344
If I go to the West,
I do not find Him.

71
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,848
When He is at work in the North,
I do not see Him.

72
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,602
When He turns to the South,
I catch no glimpse of Him.

73
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,022
But He knows the way that I take.

74
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,861
When He has tested me,
I will come forth as gold.

75
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,076
My feet have closely followed
His steps.

76
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,537
I have kept to His way
without turning aside.

77
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,749
I have not departed...

78
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:12,715
Not departed
from the commandment of His lips.

79
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,051
I have treasured the words
of His mouth

80
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,928
more than my daily bread.

81
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:23,559
But He stands alone
and who can oppose Him?

82
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,730
He does whatever He pleases.

83
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,901
He carries out His decree
against me,

84
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,821
and many such plans
He still has in store.

85
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,082
That is why
I am terrified before Him.

86
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:52,004
When I think of all this,
I fear Him.

87
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,758
God has made my heart faint.

88
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,889
The Almighty has terrified me.

89
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,312
Yet I am not silenced
by the darkness,

90
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,984
by the thick darkness
that covers my face."

91
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,035
Amen.

92
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,270
I brought you a change of clothes.

93
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,150
Pardon the fashion.
They're donated.

94
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,652
I'd have brought you some
of mine

95
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,738
but we have different physiques.

96
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,988
Better?

97
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,699
Yeah.

98
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,536
Good.
Let's go home.

99
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,425
ATFEC agents
exchanged fire with Gilchrest

100
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,803
before he staged a daring escape.

101
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,596
A tri-state manhunt is underway.

102
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,141
At this point,
no other agencies are involved.

103
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,229
In business news,
at the Chicago Board of Trade,

104
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,189
corn, wheat
and soybean prices...

105
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,909
Hey. What the--
Hey!

106
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,412
Calm down.

107
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,247
I had to.
There was no other choice.

108
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,165
What the fuck did you do?

109
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,458
Fuck!

110
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,296
- Please get the fuck off of me.
- I'm sorry.

111
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,922
Get the fuck off of me.

112
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,841
- Why did you do this?
- So sorry.

113
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,759
Get the fuck off of me!

114
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,137
This is a mistake.
A mistake.

115
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,057
I have a daughter.
Someone needs to call my daughter!

116
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,770
I'm not supposed to be here.
This is a mistake!

117
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,188
Someone call my daughter!

118
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,610
I'm not supposed to be here!

119
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,865
This is a mistake!

120
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,618
I'm not fucking crazy!

121
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:13,331
Just calm down.
Calm down. Stay calm.

122
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,708
You're okay.
Just calm down.

123
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,710
Stay calm.
You're okay.

124
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,879
Just calm down.
Stay calm. You're okay.

125
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,214
Just calm down.
Stay calm. You're okay.

126
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,966
Just calm...

127
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,778
You going to behave yourself?

128
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,406
Yeah.

129
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,079
I had to ask.

130
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,669
Ten minutes.

131
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,632
Do you usually sleep on that side?

132
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,384
Well, why don't I go to that side?

133
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,760
No, no.
I will go to that side of the bed.

134
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,263
Balki, I don't mind sleeping
on that side of the bed.

135
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,307
I'm not arguing about sleeping
on that side of the bed.

136
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:59,562
Hey, baby boy.
Have a seat.

137
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,358
Dad, I need to get to a phone.

138
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,777
Jill hasn't heard from me.
I got to call--

139
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,404
Shh...

140
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:16,954
Quiet. At last.

141
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,003
So, you finally
fucking snapped, huh?

142
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,089
- No.
- No?

143
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,757
I'm not fucking crazy.

144
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,509
Neither am I.

145
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:36,599
But I am a bad man, son,
and the bad men end up here.

146
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,268
Dad, you're--
Look, you're a good man.

147
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:42,229
I most definitely am not.

148
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,441
My intentions are good

149
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,777
but my heart and my mind
and my balls, son,

150
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:52,615
the Holy fucking Trinity,
they all knew.

151
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,950
That night three years ago,

152
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,453
we looked at ourselves
in the mirror

153
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:01,290
and none of us wondered
why we were still fucking here.

154
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,460
We knew.
Of course we knew.

155
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,132
- You know.
- I don't belong here.

156
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,509
- Yeah, you do.
- No, I don't.

157
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,636
- Yes, you--
- I have to leave here!

158
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:17,681
There is no leaving here.
Now-- Don't you fucking dare!

159
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,808
Do not turn around.

160
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,311
No, no.
Just get the fuck out of here.

161
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:26,065
Son, I said do not turn around.

162
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:31,904
Fuck him.
Turn around.

163
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,164
Hello, again.

164
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,505
Now, why'd you go and do that?

165
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,007
He needs to get out
and you weren't helping,

166
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:55,511
you crazy, dried-up,
fucking turd.

167
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,348
Oh, fuck you,
you fucking tobacco-stink twat.

168
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,225
He needs to stay.

169
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,397
Is that what you need, Kevin?

170
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,148
This isn't happening.

171
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,027
This isn't real.
You're not here.

172
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,698
It's happening.
It's real.

173
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,286
I'm here.

174
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,754
You're dead.

175
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,465
You're fucking dead.

176
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,386
I buried you.

177
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,807
Not deep...

178
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:44,977
...enough.

179
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,400
Hey, you leave with her...

180
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,987
...you leave with her.

181
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,906
Dad.
Daddy.

182
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,077
Now, Kevin.
Shh...

183
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,457
Looks like we're going to be
traveling companions.

184
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,126
Until then...

185
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,880
...you should wake the fuck up.

186
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,591
What?

187
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,135
Wake the fuck up!

188
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,929
State police
have roadblocks on Interstate 97

189
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,931
and have issued an advisory
to motorists...

190
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,933
- You okay?
- ...to dial 911 immediately

191
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,812
- if they encounter Gilchrest.
- Yeah. Fine.

192
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,693
- Where are we?
- I got hungry.

193
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,445
Want a cheeseburger?

194
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,957
God, that's good.

195
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:57,508
- So what'd she say?
- Who?

196
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,843
Patti.

197
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,804
What'd she say
before she killed herself?

198
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,014
I don't want to talk about it.

199
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,976
- I can't help if you don't tell me.
- You've helped me enough, Matt.

200
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:11,188
Not you. Them. The Remnant.

201
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,273
You can't help them.

202
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,985
Yes, I can. I know I can
because I'm supposed to.

203
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,446
But you need to tell me
why she did what she did.

204
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,699
You need to tell me what she said.

205
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:27,329
She said, "I understand."

206
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,582
- Understood what?
- I don't know.

207
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,459
Sure you do.

208
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,628
Excuse me?

209
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,967
If she wanted to deliver a message
by cutting her own throat,

210
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,388
I'm pretty sure she'd be confident
you received it before she did.

211
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,352
So, what did you understand?

212
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,065
Why we didn't go.

213
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,945
Why...

214
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,532
...we're still here.

215
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,247
Tell me.

216
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:21,341
Before it happened,
the 14th?

217
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,887
I wanted to leave.

218
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,767
I wanted to be free of...

219
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,230
...my family.

220
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,946
Wanting and doing aren't the same.

221
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,535
I slept with another woman.

222
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,542
Who?

223
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,462
I don't know her name.

224
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,841
She uh...
She disappeared.

225
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,679
You were with her?

226
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,307
At the moment of the Departure?

227
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,769
Yeah.

228
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,774
No shit.

229
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,528
What happened next?

230
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:31,119
I don't really remember all of it.
I think I was in shock.

231
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:37,960
Phones were down
and I was wearing my uniform.

232
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,464
And people kept coming up to me
and asking me for help.

233
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,302
And I couldn't or I...

234
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,348
...I didn't know how.

235
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,895
So I got in my car...

236
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,984
...and I went to Jill's school
and I ran inside.

237
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,989
She and Tommy were both there
and...

238
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,328
...they were scared.

239
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:21,503
I just remember the look
on their faces when they saw me.

240
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:26,967
They were so...

241
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,470
They...

242
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,514
They were so happy.

243
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,855
They were happy.

244
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:44,860
And...

245
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,947
...we went back to the house

246
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,575
and Laurie had already got home
so--

247
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:55,579
And she was different.
I mean, I think we all were.

248
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,709
But I just wanted to be with them.

249
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,380
And I wanted to hold them.

250
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,261
And then I started to lose them.

251
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,224
One by one.

252
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,438
It's not your fault.

253
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,068
Yes, it is.

254
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,237
It is.

255
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,299
Hey, you okay?

256
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,646
Jesus Christ.

257
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,650
Just sitting here.
Too many woes.

258
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,862
- Listen, don't move.
- Please, what's your name?

259
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,698
- Kevin.
- Kevin.

260
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,200
- You need help.
- No, Kevin, Kevin,

261
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:00,245
I'm going to be dead in a minute.
There's no help for me.

262
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,252
So, please, don't leave me alone.

263
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,759
Sure. Yeah, yeah.

264
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,845
- I'm right here.
- Thank you.

265
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,601
Will you do something for me?

266
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,729
A favor.

267
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,940
Stranger to stranger?

268
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,363
Will you make a wish?

269
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,243
A what?

270
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,664
I think I may be a fraud.

271
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,376
But if I'm not...

272
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,214
...I can give you anything you want.

273
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,553
And that will mean I was real.

274
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,725
Let me do this for you before I go.
Make a wish.

275
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,645
You don't have to say it out loud.
Just think it.

276
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,925
Granted.

277
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,784
ATFEC! Get down!
Get the fuck down! Now!

278
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,120
Get on the ground now!
Hurry up! Get down!

279
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,955
Stay the fuck down!
Let's go!

280
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,166
Come on, turn around!
Let's go!

281
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,461
Stay down!
Go!

282
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,479
What did he say to you?

283
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,692
- Uh... Just asked me my name.
- That's it?

284
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,320
Yeah, that's it.

285
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,447
Talk to you about Russia?

286
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,866
No.

287
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,995
- Make any physical contact with you?
- Why?

288
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,247
Did he?

289
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,750
No.

290
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,422
Who was he?

291
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,509
Just another asshole
who thought he was God.

292
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,347
Excuse me.
This man did nothing wrong.

293
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:09,517
We were just having lunch
and he's a police officer, a chief.

294
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,062
- You're a cop?
- Yeah.

295
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,605
Why didn't you say so?

296
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,358
I'm off-duty.

297
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,861
- Where you from?
- New York, Mapleton.

298
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,281
Okay, we're good here, Chief.
Thanks for your cooperation.

299
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,911
Go on home to Mapleton.

300
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,465
Stop, now! You...

301
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,267
Hey!
Drop the gun!

302
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,685
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

303
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:37,814
It's okay. Calm down.
Drop the gun.

304
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,526
- What's your name?
- What?

305
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,446
Drop the gun. We can talk about
whatever you want to talk about.

306
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,989
Listen, I'm a cop.

307
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,783
Do you see what they did?

308
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,327
- Stop!
- Go get her.

309
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,704
It's all right. Calm down.
Just drop the gun.

310
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,331
Fuck you!

311
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,920
- Hey!
- I'll kill you, fucker!

312
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,312
Hey!

313
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,193
Kevin!

314
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,408
Jesus Christ.

315
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,288
Can you hear me?

316
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:43,922
What happened?
What happened?

317
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,508
What the fuck did you people do?

318
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,219
- She's hurt.
- She wants to be fucking hurt.

319
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,690
What happened?

320
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,094
I'm going to kill you!

321
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,256
Jesus. Lucy. Lucy.

322
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,926
- You all right?
- You were right.

323
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,636
You were right.

324
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:18,433
Please. Go back to your homes,
for your own safety!

325
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:19,767
- Dennis!
- Chief!

326
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,519
- They have not--
- Where the fuck is everybody?

327
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,646
I couldn't stop them.
They left.

328
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,273
Give me a fucking gun.

329
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,026
- Where's all the fire trucks?
- I called them.

330
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,278
They want to wait
until the road's clear.

331
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,946
Well, then
you clear the fucking cars

332
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,698
out of the goddamn road
so they can get in.

333
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,450
Chief, nobody wants to help them.

334
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,702
- Get out of my way.
- It's their own fault.

335
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,995
Listen, go back to that fucking--

336
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,164
Stay at this barricade
and do not let anyone through.

337
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,124
Do you understand?
Go.

338
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,628
Step back!
Hold it! Hold this fucking line!

339
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,880
Step the fuck back!

340
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,825
How dare you?

341
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,339
Stop!

342
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,176
Hey, I'll get you somewhere safe.

343
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,761
I'll get you somewhere safe.

344
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,888
- Jill. Jill.
- I'll get you somewhere safe.

345
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,892
Jill!

346
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:33,795
You okay?

347
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,519
It's all right.
It's all right.

348
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:06,554
"Dear Kevin, I need to say
goodbye to someone I care about,

349
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:10,725
someone who's still here,
so I'm saying it to you.

350
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,731
You were good to me, Kevin,
and sometimes when we were together,

351
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,901
I remembered who I used to be
before everything changed.

352
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,406
But I was pretending,

353
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:28,242
pretending as if
I hadn't lost everything.

354
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:34,916
I want to believe it can all go back
to the way it was.

355
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,754
I want to believe
that I'm not surrounded

356
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,924
by the abandoned ruin
of a dead civilization.

357
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,556
I want to believe it's still possible
to get close to someone.

358
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,811
But it's easier not to.

359
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,481
It's easier because I'm a coward.

360
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,860
And I couldn't take the pain.
Not again.

361
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,532
I know that's not fair, Kevin.

362
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:13,371
You've lost so much, too,
and you're strong.

363
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:17,083
You're still here.

364
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,839
But I can't be, not anymore.

365
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,884
I tried to get better, Kevin.

366
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:30,805
I didn't want to feel this way,
so I took a shortcut.

367
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,477
But it led me right back home.

368
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,939
And do you know what I found
when I got there?

369
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:46,320
I found them, Kevin,
right where I left them.

370
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,535
Right where they left me.

371
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,916
It took me three years
to accept the truth

372
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,751
but now I know
there's no going back.

373
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,253
No fixing it.

374
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,676
I'm beyond repair.

375
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,681
Maybe we're all beyond repair.

376
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,518
I can't go on the way I'm living.

377
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:21,272
But I don't have the power to die.

378
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:26,694
But I have to move
towards something.

379
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,908
Anything.

380
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:37,747
I'm not sure where I'm going,
just away.

381
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,500
Away from all this.

382
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,213
I think about a place
where nobody will know

383
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,715
what happened to me.

384
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:52,053
But then I worry I'll forget them.

385
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:59,560
I don't ever want to forget them.
I can't.

386
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,023
They were my family.

387
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:13,366
I think I loved you, Kevin.
Maybe you loved me, too.

388
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:21,415
I wish I could say this to you
instead of writing it.

389
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,046
I wish I could see you
one last time

390
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,589
to thank you and wish you well

391
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,758
and tell you how much
you mean to me.

392
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,311
But I can't.

393
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,277
Like I said, I'm a coward.

394
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,493
So, wish me luck.

395
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,579
I think I'm going to need it.

396
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,920
Love, Nora."

397
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,678
Hi.

398
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,456
Look what I found.
