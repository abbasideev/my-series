1
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:11,885
This is the story of a little boy.

2
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,474
I'd say stop me
if you've heard this one before,

3
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:21,437
but you have,
and I don't really wanna be stopped.

4
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,527
This boy, he's a good kid,
not perfect, but good,

5
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,613
and when he's about ten years old,

6
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:34,658
his mom and dad tell him
he's gonna have a baby sister.

7
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:40,080
And the baby sister comes and,
of course, he loves her very much.

8
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,418
But... she's getting attention.

9
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,421
His attention.

10
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,299
So he wishes--

11
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:55,220
Actually,
he prays for that attention back.

12
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:02,936
A month later, he's diagnosed
with acute lymphatic leukemia.

13
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:10,569
And the cancer eats away at the boy
until there is almost nothing left.

14
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,363
But he fights it.

15
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:20,162
He survives,
and now he has a choice to make.

16
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:26,960
Does he decide that he was punished,
or that he was rewarded?

17
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,714
Will he be angry
for having been made to suffer

18
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,592
or will he be grateful
for that suffering

19
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,678
because it changed him?

20
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,103
This is the story of a little girl.

21
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,981
She's eight years old

22
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,361
and just over a week ago,
she's playing in the park.

23
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,740
She loves to go high on the swings,

24
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:01,036
up to the point where you hang there
for a moment, suspended,

25
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,124
before the chains clink
and gravity pulls you back down.

26
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,838
She's been asleep.

27
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,385
In a coma, for nine days now.

28
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,555
Her brain activity is negligible.

29
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,558
Her outcome is undetermined.

30
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,563
The girl's name is Emily.

31
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:36,405
And so, that little boy
is asking for attention again now.

32
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:43,036
For Emily, let us pray.

33
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,669
Heavenly Father,

34
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,381
You invite all who are burdened
to come to You.

35
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,886
Allow Your healing hand
to touch this girl.

36
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,473
Fill her heart with Your courage

37
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,436
and infinite love
for all that You create.

38
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,325
Please.

39
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,371
Stop. Please.

40
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,920
It's probably not a concussion.

41
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,964
Doctor will wanna take a look at you
before you can go.

42
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,466
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

43
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:49,348
"Mrs. Amber Johnson,
a local pharmacist trainee,

44
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,601
secretly stole
significant quantities of Percocet,

45
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,186
oxycodone and Vicodin

46
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,772
and sold it
to community college students."

47
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,065
I know what it says.

48
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:04,404
- Amber here, she poofed?
- She was a Departure, yes.

49
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,282
So you think our assailant
knew Amber?

50
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,743
Maybe didn't appreciate
your little newsletter.

51
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,080
I got this one, Lou.

52
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,915
Chief, I was taking a statement.

53
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,917
- There's no need for you--
- You wanna press charges, Matt?

54
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,336
- No.
- There you go.

55
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,215
Father.

56
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,053
Here we are again.

57
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,767
Occupational hazard.
What are you gonna do?

58
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,060
Stop pissing people off.

59
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,898
They need to hear the truth.
Your dad understood that.

60
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,609
Look where that got him.

61
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,364
You know, me and Jill

62
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,907
are living
in the old man's place now.

63
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,119
Come over tonight,
I'll grill up some steaks.

64
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,205
Do a Sunday dinner, like old times.

65
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,375
Nights are tough for me.

66
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,045
Sorry.

67
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,806
See you next time, Chief.

68
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,333
I guess you and me
are going to the same place.

69
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,059
You need help?

70
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,437
Emily.

71
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,357
The girl who was in here,
do you know what happened?

72
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:09,446
She woke up, asked for a Sprite.

73
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,159
- She's okay?
- I guess so.

74
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,869
You know her?

75
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,498
No, I visited with her,
but my congregation....

76
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,376
This morning, we prayed for her.

77
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,796
Well, she woke up last night.

78
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,366
Hello, you've reached the
administrative offices of Our Savior.

79
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,368
Please leave a message
at the sound of the tone.

80
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,039
Matt, hi.
It's Jim Lewis from FDR.

81
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,208
You're a hard man to reach.

82
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,918
I'd really love to talk to you
in person

83
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,170
preferably as soon as possible.

84
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,590
I'm here at the bank all day.
Talk soon. Bye.

85
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:36,032
Hey, hi, um, are you open?

86
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,785
Sure. Come in.

87
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:44,499
I don't know if you remember me.
I used to come all the time.

88
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,668
Craig, right? McNary?

89
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,087
Yeah.
Sorry, I haven't been in a while.

90
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:54,134
My wife, ever since the 14th,
she's not really into, you know....

91
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,096
Anyway,
she's over getting a manicure

92
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,265
and I told her
to get her feet done, too,

93
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,684
you know,
just to take some time for herself.

94
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,397
I'll take the baby, come back
to pick her up later, so....

95
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,446
How long does it take to do a,
you know, baptism?

96
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,203
We have that confidentiality thing,
right?

97
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,996
I'll try to keep my mouth shut.

98
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,294
I don't know what the appropriate
contribution is, but--

99
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,881
- Please. It's on the house.
- You sure?

100
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,928
How about you ask your wife

101
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,764
to join you and your son
for services this Sunday?

102
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,432
We'll call it even.

103
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,478
I don't think that's gonna happen.

104
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,021
Had to try.

105
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,442
If I don't, who will?

106
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,199
This guy I worked with...

107
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,952
...he used to get loaded

108
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,746
and drive out to the Indian Casino
in Connecticut.

109
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,290
He'd gamble away his paycheck
every other Thursday.

110
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,792
And when that was gone,

111
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,129
I heard he cleaned out
his kids' college account.

112
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,635
He went on the 14th.

113
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,434
What was his name?

114
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,022
Andrew Sasaki.

115
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,653
We don't discuss personal information
about our clientele.

116
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,864
Sure, of course not.

117
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,451
This man, Mr. Sasaki,
he was a Departure,

118
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,786
and the reason
I'm asking about him is....

119
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,747
I'm sorry, I know this is personal,

120
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,166
but did you lose anyone
close to you, sir?

121
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,466
My niece, she was nine.

122
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,053
May I show you something?

123
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,769
This...

124
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,232
...is Albert Wayne Studdard.

125
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,944
He abducted a young girl
walking home from school,

126
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,072
violated her sexually,
strangled her to death.

127
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,952
On October 14th, he disappeared
right out of his jail cell.

128
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:13,208
And this man, this monster,
is on the same list,

129
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,084
along with all the others
who left us,

130
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,420
along with the innocent and good.

131
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,006
Along with your niece.

132
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,469
Someone has to expose these people

133
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,597
for who they truly were
and what they truly did.

134
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,519
Because if we can no longer separate
the innocent from the guilty,

135
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:37,232
everything that happened to us,
all of our suffering, is meaningless.

136
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,949
I think I know what happened
to your face.

137
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,952
Can you help me?

138
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,249
We don't keep the security cam data
past six months.

139
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,626
But I'll see what I can do.

140
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,546
Jesus fucking Christ!

141
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,923
Come on!

142
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,551
What about the bet?
What about the bet?

143
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,638
Get out of here. Get out of here!

144
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,307
I have to deal with this.

145
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,519
Get down to Pit Four.
There's fucking birds on the table.

146
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,207
I'm sorry, I don't have any in white.

147
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,464
I know you have a job to do,
but please tell Patti

148
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,050
she's wasting your time
sending you here.

149
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,135
I've made it this far.

150
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,263
I'm not gonna turn around now.

151
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,568
What the hell?

152
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,283
- What?
- Hello, Matt?

153
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,162
Hey, Jim, is that you?

154
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,666
I'm sorry.
My phone's been acting up.

155
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,128
- How are you?
- Good. I'm good.

156
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,675
Matt, I'm sure you're busy,
but can you come by the bank?

157
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,635
- Sure.
- It's important.

158
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:15,556
Yeah, I'll come right over.
Thank you.

159
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,106
There's been an offer on the church.

160
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,945
But I don't understand.
You said I could stay.

161
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:33,074
Matt, I said you could stay
as long as no buyers came forward.

162
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,827
I'm sorry, Matt.

163
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,998
I've been trying to tell you
for at least two weeks now.

164
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,335
And you always knew
this could happen

165
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:49,132
once you stopped making payments
and we had to foreclose.

166
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,218
Who's the buyer?

167
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:57,557
Corporate LLC,
probably a hedge fund.

168
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:02,145
They can't really remodel,
but the land is worth something.

169
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,817
They probably wanna knock it down
and throw up some apartments.

170
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,235
Knock it--

171
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,655
Well, it's not some restaurant.
This is a house of worsh--

172
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,121
I'm sorry, I have to take this.

173
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,668
Hey. Can I call you back?
I'm in the middle of a--

174
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,754
We're out of bleach.

175
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,548
What? Which kind?

176
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:34,302
Yeah. Okay.
I'll grab some on the way home.

177
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,012
- Bye.
- Bye.

178
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,557
How is Mary?

179
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,438
Tell me how I can keep my church.

180
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:52,028
With no other offers on the table,
we have to accept theirs.

181
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:56,699
But now if you can come in,
all cash,

182
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,327
even $1 above their price,

183
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,080
I can get your name
back on the deed.

184
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,500
What was their price?

185
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,755
One hundred and thirty five thousand.

186
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,056
How much time do I have?

187
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,852
Tomorrow. End of day.

188
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,297
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

189
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,558
- Bar fight?
- Am I interrupting anything?

190
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,726
No, I was just watching TV.
Come on in.

191
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,079
Doug won't mind. I promise.

192
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,007
Is Mary okay?

193
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,093
She's great.

194
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,639
And what?

195
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,770
I need to borrow $135,000.

196
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,400
- What?
- They're gonna sell the church.

197
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,911
I'm sorry.

198
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,169
I know it's a lot of money,
but it'd just be a loan.

199
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,588
Things are changing.
People are ready to come back.

200
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,424
I just performed a baptism
this morning.

201
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:24,722
I hate coming to you,
but this is our family church.

202
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,684
- Mom and Dad's.
- No, Matt, it's your church.

203
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:29,894
They left it to both of us.

204
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,938
They didn't leave it to anyone.

205
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,607
They died in a fire when I was seven
and then it was given--

206
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,692
Please, don't get upset.

207
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,278
- Why do you always have to do that?
- What?

208
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,240
Make me upset
and then tell me not to get upset.

209
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,617
You can't just knock on my door
and asked for $135,000--

210
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,910
Do you not have it?

211
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,288
I thought the benefit money.

212
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,462
That money was for my husband
and my children.

213
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,301
I'm sorry.

214
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,306
You're right.
I shouldn't have asked.

215
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,310
I just didn't know where to go.

216
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:26,117
- Will you stop making your paper?
- What?

217
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,870
You're asking me for something,
I'm asking you for something.

218
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,999
Stop making your paper
and I'll give you the money.

219
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,333
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

220
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,835
People need to hear the truth.

221
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,378
People need to punch you in the face.

222
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,797
I didn't say it was easy to hear.

223
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,549
Then deliver the "truth"
in your church.

224
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,384
That's what you're asking me for.
Right? Your church?

225
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,760
- That's not what this is about.
- No!

226
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:47,763
It's about the accident.
It's about the judge.

227
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,141
And it should have ended there!

228
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,143
But you kept going.
You dug up your dirt.

229
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,853
And people called you crazy
behind your back,

230
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,272
and I defended you
because I knew you were in pain.

231
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,358
But you decided it was your calling,
your purpose.

232
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,360
Like, you were personally
selected by God--

233
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,904
Don't say that word.
Don't say that word.

234
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,408
You don't get to talk
about something you don't believe.

235
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,201
I don't get to?

236
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,204
What do you believe in, Matt?

237
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,875
Do you know where my family went?

238
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,961
Do you know what it was?

239
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,427
It was a test.

240
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:34,977
Not for what came before,
but for what came after.

241
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,564
It was a test for what comes now.

242
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:43,027
Well, if it was a test,
then I think you may be failing it.

243
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,835
I love you, Matt.

244
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,761
But what you're doing:
your paper, the church,

245
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,346
it's not working anymore.

246
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,309
It's not making things better.

247
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,439
Maybe it's time to let it go.

248
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,368
Hm.

249
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,791
Doug was having an affair.

250
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,341
The kid's preschool teacher.

251
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,554
They usually did it
at her apartment.

252
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,724
But a couple of times...

253
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,020
...he brought her to The Plaza,
in the city.

254
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,317
He was smart enough
to use cash, but...

255
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,739
...I have the receipts from the ATM
in their lobby.

256
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,999
It's the one story
I will never publish.

257
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,309
Because I love you, too.

258
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,854
Get out.

259
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:01,415
They're gone,
but so much of them is still here.

260
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:07,671
You've tried to move on,
tried to live a normal life,

261
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:12,301
but you haven't let go
because you haven't known how.

262
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,558
Loved Ones bereavement figures
allow you to say that good-bye.

263
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,686
With as little
as a single photograph,

264
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,856
Loved Ones can create a tangible
likeness of your Departed.

265
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,235
A bereavement figure
for burial or cremation

266
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,570
allowing you and your family
to finally--

267
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,113
- Hey.
- ...begin to feel hope again.

268
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,366
Visit a Loved Ones associate today

269
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,743
- or visit us online to receive....
- Uh...

270
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:43,749
This is the only kind they have.
But bleach is bleach, right?

271
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,251
It's fine.

272
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,504
Is everything okay?

273
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,590
When are you gonna pay me again,
Mr. Matthew?

274
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,385
Oh...

275
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,054
Right. I'm sorry about that.

276
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,640
I'd write you a check,

277
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,434
but I've been moving money
between accounts and--

278
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,562
Three weeks I work here for nothing.

279
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:09,191
I know, I know. Here take this.

280
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,073
And I'll give you the rest
when I can.

281
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,828
Great, thanks.

282
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,164
If you can't pay me,
I can't do this anymore.

283
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,791
You understand, yes?

284
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,545
Yeah, I understand.

285
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,047
She needs her bath.

286
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,284
Hello, sweetheart.

287
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,239
Help me.

288
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,568
Thanks so much for doing this,
Roxana.

289
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,987
I never would've called
if it wasn't an emergency.

290
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,657
- Nights are overtime.
- Right, of course. Thank you.

291
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:46,992
Mary's asleep upstairs.

292
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,869
I just didn't want to leave her
here on her own.

293
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,579
How long will you be?

294
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,956
Three, maybe four hours,
morning at the latest.

295
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,416
And when I get back,

296
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,502
I'm gonna pay you
everything I owe you.

297
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,087
All of it, tonight included.

298
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,134
I'll come through this time.

299
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,845
I swear.

300
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,253
Uh, Kevin's dad,

301
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,840
your father-in-law,
he left something here.

302
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,468
For me.

303
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,433
He said I could get it
whenever I wanted.

304
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,668
I won't say anything, if you won't.

305
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,286
- Hello.
- Hello.

306
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,167
- How would you like it, sir?
- In chips.

307
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,087
What denomination?

308
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,673
Well, does it matter?

309
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,567
Twenty thousand. Good luck.

310
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:58,053
- Would you like to bet?
- Yes, on red.

311
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,014
Right there, sir.

312
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,946
High-limit tables are in the back.
If you'll allow me to escort you--

313
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,907
No, I wanna play on this table.

314
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,410
Please.

315
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,213
Twenty thousand on red.

316
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,258
No more bets?

317
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,395
Winner. Red.

318
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,108
Forty thousand.

319
00:35:55,236 --> 00:36:01,199
- Oh, shit. We got a player here.
- Again, please.

320
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,411
Uh...

321
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,040
Forty thousand on red.

322
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,213
No more bets?

323
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:34,441
- Winner. Red.
- That was insane.

324
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,863
Congratulations.
Eighty thousand.

325
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,997
- Once more, please.
- Jesus, man.

326
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,583
Hey, you know something
that we don't know?

327
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,501
What the fuck are you doing, Tina?

328
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,170
You're gonna jinx the guy.
That's a fucking jinx.

329
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,215
- No, you bet with him.
- No, no, no, black is due. Sorry.

330
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,927
What do you mean?

331
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:12,437
Eighty thousand on red. Good luck.

332
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,828
No more bets?

333
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,840
One hundred and sixty thousand.
Congratulations, sir.

334
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,534
Ahh.

335
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:03,548
Hey, winner, winner,
chicken dinner, right?

336
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,258
Yeah.

337
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,260
- Congrats, man.
- Thanks.

338
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,179
You were on fire!
I've never seen balls like that.

339
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,473
I was trying to get my girl
not to bet against you,

340
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,516
but she fucking ignored me, right?

341
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,477
- I have to--
- Listen, here's the thing though.

342
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,228
We dropped our last hundred.

343
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,147
And we got to be in Niagara Falls
in the morning,

344
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,648
and that's at least
two tanks of gas.

345
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,443
I was just wondering
maybe you could help us out.

346
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,112
You know.
Unless you're short on cash.

347
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,909
- Sure.
- Thank you.

348
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,998
Here's two. Gas is expensive.

349
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,043
You know what, man?

350
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,505
Why don't you hang on to that
and I'll just take that envelope?

351
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,509
No.

352
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,774
Get in the fucking car!

353
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,826
My God.

354
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:20,500
Please, stop! My God!
Stop, please. Please stop!

355
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,174
My God. My God.

356
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,512
Are you okay, huh?

357
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,764
What did they throw?

358
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,564
Yes, there's been an attack.

359
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,025
A man was hit with a rock.
He's bleeding.

360
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,570
We're on Cedar Lane and...

361
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,697
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

362
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:43,351
- Am I too late?
- Of course not. All are welcome.

363
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,609
I'm sorry, Matthew,
but it's spreading.

364
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:27,789
- Are they burning in there?
- Yes, Nora, they are.

365
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:31,042
Why isn't anybody doing anything?

366
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:43,930
Sam. Sam, where are you?

367
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,599
Help me.

368
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,604
- We need some help.
- Sam!

369
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:55,566
Sam! Sam!

370
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:12,250
Honey? Can you hear me?

371
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:17,171
Help! Please, I need help!

372
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,761
Honey?

373
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,941
Help me! My wife is hurt!

374
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,985
Please help!

375
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,144
Why do you persist?

376
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,242
Why isn't anybody
doing anything?

377
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,996
- Hey, you shouldn't be up.
- What time is it?

378
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,706
You need to sit down.

379
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:19,544
- What time is it?
- 16:30.

380
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,588
Please, I need you to call the bank.

381
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,383
FDR, the one on Beekman,

382
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:29,011
ask to speak to Jim Lewis,
tell him not to close.

383
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:32,098
Tell him Matt Jamison
is coming over right now.

384
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,892
- Wait a minute. I don't know.
- Just call him!

385
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:19,061
- No, no, someone called.
- Sorry, we're closed. We're closed.

386
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,563
I need to see Jim Lewis.

387
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,608
- We open tomorrow at 8:00.
- Wait. He's expecting me.

388
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,109
Hey, step back!

389
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,612
- Hey. Hey.
- Jim, Jim, it's Matt!

390
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,363
It's okay, Frank. Let him in.

391
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:36,621
Jesus, Matt! What happened?

392
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:41,417
I was.... I'm fine. I'm fine.

393
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:45,296
Here it is, all of it in cash.

394
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,633
What?

395
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,845
I'm sorry, Matt. It's too late.

396
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,392
No. No.

397
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,980
You said end of day.
It's only ten minutes.

398
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:06,567
I have the money, we made a deal.

399
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,446
That was three days ago.

400
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,908
What?

401
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,494
You came in on Monday.

402
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:20,414
This is Thursday.

403
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:23,167
Now, I tried calling you
on your cell phone, but--

404
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:30,424
I'm--
I'm sorry, Matt.

405
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:36,722
No one here wanted them to have it
but they paid all cash, no escrow.

406
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:42,186
They...
They took possession yesterday.

407
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,524
They?
