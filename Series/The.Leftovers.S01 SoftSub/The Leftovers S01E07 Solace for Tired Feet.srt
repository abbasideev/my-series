1
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,961
Fuck her. Come on.

2
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:10,152
- Okay. Let me out.
- Really, Scotty?

3
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,572
It's been 27 minutes.
That's nothing.

4
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,740
Come on! I'm done.

5
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,409
You have, like,
a half an hour of air left.

6
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,870
- You little bitch, you're fine.
- Let him out, dick.

7
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:28,045
Whoa! He returns unto us,
unmolested by the great darkness.

8
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,089
Give me a break.

9
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,050
Hey, when he suffocates,
do you suffocate?

10
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,010
- Har har!
- No, really.

11
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:39,973
Scott Frost
with a pathetic 28 minutes.

12
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,559
That's not even near the record,
buddy.

13
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,687
I can break the record.

14
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,856
Uh, excuse me, Garvey.

15
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,984
You need to do the invocation
before you attempt the crossing.

16
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:54,238
- That's stupid.
- Invo-fucking-cation, Garvey.

17
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,036
"On October 14th, 2011,

18
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,665
Paul Glouski was forced
inside this conveyance

19
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,875
against his will in a childish prank

20
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,585
and was never seen
or heard from again."

21
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,337
"Nor heard from again."

22
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,214
"Nor heard from again.

23
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,925
Now I honor the mystery of his loss

24
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:18,679
by repeating his suffering
and embracing the great darkness."

25
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,931
Amen.

26
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,891
I'll miss you. Be safe.

27
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,271
See you on the other side, Garvey.

28
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,410
Thanks.

29
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,635
You want to come over?

30
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,100
- Right now?
- Mm-hm.

31
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,645
You sure?

32
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,105
The first four dates,
I was on the fence,

33
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,941
but I'm over it now.

34
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,864
All right.
Let me just check in with Jill.

35
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,789
- So have you told her about us?
- Sure.

36
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,751
"Hey, honey.

37
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,422
About to go have sex with Nora
for the first time.

38
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,634
A little nervous.

39
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,762
Wish me luck."

40
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,682
- And a winky face.
- No, stop.

41
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,353
Send.

42
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,076
Yup.

43
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,829
Shit.

44
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,000
Fuck.

45
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,003
Twenty-one seconds
and you've got the record, Garvey.

46
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:20,676
Nineteen, 18, 17,
16, 15,

47
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,845
14, 13, 12

48
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,808
11, ten, nine, eight, seven,

49
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,061
six, five, four, three, two, one!

50
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,480
- You got it!
- Woo!

51
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,275
Get me out of here!

52
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,403
Shit.

53
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,862
- Shit.
- My God.

54
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,741
- What happened?
- This thing isn't working.

55
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,703
- It's not working.
- Get me out of here!

56
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,706
My God!

57
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,792
- Let me out!
- We're gonna get you out!

58
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,086
- Just wait up.
- Find something to open it with!

59
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,422
- Fucking shit!
- How long? How long?

60
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,215
I can't breathe!

61
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,427
Garvey, it's okay.

62
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,138
- Is she breathing?
- Somebody fucking call 911!

63
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,355
Get the fuck back!

64
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,884
Don't tell your dad you saw me.

65
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,768
- Who was that?
- My grandpa.

66
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,197
Shit.

67
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:34,494
Fuck. Fuck. Fucker!
Goddamn it!

68
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,459
Fuck.

69
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,303
Hey.

70
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,973
Wake up. I made you some soup.

71
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,726
There's spiders under water.

72
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,313
Christine, come on.
You need to eat something.

73
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,064
I'm not hungry.

74
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,196
You're burning up.

75
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,991
- The baby, it's--
- Nothing can hurt the baby.

76
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,076
He's the one.

77
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,080
The only one. He's the bridge.

78
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:23,043
Okay. Okay. You need some rest.

79
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,463
Did Wayne call?

80
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,549
No, Christine.
Wayne hasn't called in two months.

81
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,176
He'll call.

82
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,806
Here.

83
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,270
I'll be right back.

84
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,948
- Help you?
- Yeah.

85
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,326
- Are these safe for pregnant women?
- How far along is she?

86
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,286
Almost eight months.

87
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,955
She should call her O.B.

88
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,458
Okay, thanks. I'll do that.

89
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,515
Hello?

90
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,730
Wayne?

91
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,900
- Who's this?
- It's Tom.

92
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,402
Tom.

93
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,070
Tom.

94
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,406
Tom!

95
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,617
Of course it is. I know that.
I called you.

96
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,828
Are you okay?

97
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,163
I'm great. I'm just great, Tom.

98
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,333
Is Christine with you right now?

99
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,335
- No, I'm at a pharmacy, so...
- Fine.

100
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,130
- How much is left?
- What?

101
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,716
The money that I gave you.
How much is left?

102
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:57,721
- About $6,000.
- Fuck. All right, Tom.

103
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,140
What you need to do is,
you need to take that money

104
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,766
and you need to take half of it.

105
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,351
That's three.

106
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,562
You need to put it in an envelope
and take that envelope

107
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:10,609
and you seal it very securely
under the mailbox

108
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,986
on Harper and 15th.

109
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,322
It's across from the chicken place.

110
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,076
- When do you need me to go?
- Now, Tom. Fucking now.

111
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,790
- And then what?
- Tom.

112
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,168
Don't ask me "then what?"

113
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,379
I'm sorry.

114
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,465
It's just Christine is--

115
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,384
You know, she's pretty sick,
and the baby's coming soon--

116
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,137
"Naked I came from my mother's womb,

117
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,766
and naked I will depart."

118
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,731
Have you fucked her, Tom?
Have you put it in, just a little?

119
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,400
No.

120
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,405
Just do what I told you to do.
Get the fucking money, yeah?

121
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,491
Yeah.

122
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,164
It won't be long now.

123
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,189
Are you fucking kidding me?

124
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,410
Is this because of me?
Is this Patti's fucking idea?

125
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,832
Okay, I'm asking you to leave.

126
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,877
Right now!
This house is off fucking limits.

127
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,056
Want to come inside?

128
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,731
That was fucking fantastic.

129
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:17,861
Why, thank you.
I usually ignore them.

130
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,739
First time they've been out there
in a couple of months.

131
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,367
Though I'm pretty sure they broke in
and stole some of my family photos.

132
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,120
Ah. Mm...
On the night of the dance.

133
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,914
- On the night I met you.
- Right.

134
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,918
No, they broke
into a whole bunch of houses.

135
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,295
Basically anyone who--

136
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,924
Lost someone?

137
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,178
Right.

138
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,347
I have to question their strategy.

139
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,932
I mean, that's how they
recruit people?

140
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,601
"No! My family photos are gone.

141
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,645
I better stop talking
and start chain-smoking."

142
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,107
Oh, shit.

143
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,526
Your wife, I'm--

144
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,528
- Ah, no.
- I'm sorry.

145
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,364
Come on. It's okay.

146
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,876
I don't...

147
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,131
I don't know how to talk to you yet.

148
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,385
I don't know how to talk to you,
either.

149
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,973
Those fuckers ruined it, huh?

150
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,688
Wanna try again tomorrow night?

151
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,692
Absolutely.

152
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,491
Hey.

153
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,830
I thought you weren't
coming home tonight.

154
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,418
What's up?

155
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,588
Just ask him.

156
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,010
What? What happened?

157
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,765
What did Grandpa do?

158
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,811
Why?

159
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,105
Did he hurt anyone?

160
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,900
- Why are you asking?
- Did he?

161
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,486
Yeah.

162
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,073
And that's why
he's in that hospital?

163
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,326
Yes.

164
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:34,247
Well, he's not anymore.

165
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,208
What?

166
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:42,505
Chief, this is the only photo
I could find on such short notice.

167
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,382
- Everybody's waiting.
- All right. Thanks.

168
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,509
Your daughter saw him, huh?
I mean, what are the odds of that?

169
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,678
Pass out the photos, Dennis.

170
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,763
All right, everybody. Listen up.

171
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,933
As most of you are aware,
a couple of years ago,

172
00:14:54,059 --> 00:15:00,189
our former chief started exhibiting
some erratic behavior.

173
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,651
"Erratic"?
He burned down the fucking library.

174
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,904
Following which

175
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,282
he voluntarily remanded himself
to a secure psychiatric facility...

176
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,118
which he has just walked out of.

177
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,580
I want patrols working all
residential neighborhoods all night.

178
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,706
Work a grid.

179
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,791
How do you want us to handle it
if we get eyes on him, chief?

180
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,668
Do not engage.
Just call me immediately.

181
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,170
Is that understood?

182
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,505
Do you have any idea what he wants?

183
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,634
It doesn't matter what he wants.

184
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,011
What if we find him
in a violent situation?

185
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,223
Then you have to stop him.

186
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,310
Dismissed.

187
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,272
Four on this side.

188
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,691
Squawk me if anyone runs
out the back.

189
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,243
Chief.

190
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,913
- Is he in there?
- What?

191
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,915
My father. Is he in there with you?

192
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,043
- They let him out?
- No.

193
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,586
He escaped.

194
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,049
- Did anybody get hurt?
- Not yet.

195
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,176
I'm gonna have to come in there
and take a look around.

196
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,469
Fuck you, Kevin.

197
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,388
I haven't talked to your father
in a month.

198
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,598
What?

199
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,061
I could ignore the crazy.

200
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,397
Even he could ignore it for a while,
but...

201
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,607
he just wouldn't
shut the fuck up.

202
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,736
Will you call me if he comes here?

203
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,240
He's not coming to me, Kevin.

204
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,575
He's coming to you.

205
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,416
Cairo.

206
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,559
Come on, Chief. I got one trapped.

207
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,615
Dad.

208
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,245
Tommy.

209
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,559
Don't want to shoot.

210
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,665
Did you find him?

211
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,252
What?

212
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:59,423
- Grandpa. Did you find him?
- No. No. Not yet.

213
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,678
Why is there a dog
tied up in our yard?

214
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,347
Your dad brought him home
last night.

215
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,015
I can't believe you didn't wake up.

216
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,936
So, what, it's ours now?

217
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,855
He's gonna rehabilitate it.

218
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,485
How's your hand? Did you put
Neosporin like I told you?

219
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,780
Yeah.

220
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,032
It's....

221
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,703
It's good. Thanks.

222
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,044
Hello?

223
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,091
Is he okay? I'll be right there.

224
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,844
I got to go.

225
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,069
No, I don't know yet, sir.

226
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,990
What happened?

227
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,493
It's okay. Just tell me.

228
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:14,373
Saw him trying to get in,
so I went over to talk to him.

229
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,959
Why the fuck
did you do that, Dennis?

230
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,839
He always liked me.

231
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,996
Excuse me.
Did you see the man who did this?

232
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,956
No inglés.

233
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,334
Oh. Uh...

234
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:02,588
- Visto quién hizo éste?
- Sí.

235
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,642
No.

236
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,657
Come on. Jesus!

237
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,451
Will you please?

238
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:44,333
Get back, motherfucker! Get back!
This is my house.

239
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,336
Get back! Give me--

240
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,632
Hey, honey.

241
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:56,303
- What are you doing?
- I know, goddamn it.

242
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,139
I'm not at liberty to say.

243
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,811
- You hungry?
- Uh... uh-huh.

244
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,611
What the hell happened
to my cabinetry?

245
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,906
- Deer broke in.
- No shit.

246
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,621
Try not to get trapped in there.

247
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,250
How did you know?

248
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,669
Uh...

249
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,671
I didn't.

250
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,550
I walked out the back door
of my residence.

251
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,260
I just started running.

252
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,721
About ten minutes later,

253
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:42,141
I come across a bunch of idiots
yelling at a refrigerator.

254
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,894
You expect me to believe that?

255
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,732
Not really.

256
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:55,237
Your voices,
can you hear them right now?

257
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,239
Yeah.

258
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,116
What are they saying?

259
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,912
They're saying...

260
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,209
...that you look like Snow White.

261
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,802
Could I borrow 200 bucks?

262
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,388
I don't have any cash.

263
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,769
You have any tranquilizers?

264
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,943
- Will those help you?
- They're not for me.

265
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,822
They're for that dog out there
trying to eat my balls.

266
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,034
Jesus.

267
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,745
Why is your dad taking
all this shit?

268
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,749
He's under a lot of pressure,
I guess.

269
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:54,338
Yeah, I reckon he is.
How's your brother?

270
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,173
I haven't talked to him in a while.

271
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,844
- You know where he is?
- Anywhere that's not here.

272
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,723
Here ain't so bad, sweetheart.

273
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,768
Bingo.

274
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,898
We need some meat. You got meat?

275
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,567
Why are you drugging the dog?

276
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,111
Because he won't--

277
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,406
She's just trying to help.

278
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,574
What the fuck do you think--

279
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,618
- Jill!
- Disarm system now.

280
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,621
Jill! Jill, where are you?

281
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,124
We're up here!

282
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,130
When did you call him?

283
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,717
Before I let you in.

284
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,638
Good girl.

285
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,233
I borrowed your sweatshirt.

286
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:20,841
I'll take him back.

287
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,260
Okay.

288
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,780
Dennis okay?

289
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,991
He's gonna need stitches.

290
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:49,536
He's a nice guy. Tell him I'm sorry.

291
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,538
He just got in my way.

292
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,543
- How you sleeping?
- What?

293
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:00,130
You have a fucking pharmacy
on your nightstand.

294
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,092
- That shit fucks with your head.
- Thanks for the advice.

295
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,471
You used to take my advice.

296
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,643
- You're not gonna ask me, are you?
- Ask you what?

297
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,728
Why I busted out.

298
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,022
Dad, I don't need this shit
right now.

299
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,567
Maybe it's exactly what you need.

300
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,236
- What the fuck does that even mean?
- Stop!

301
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,407
Damn it! What the fuck!

302
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,910
Jesus fucking Christ.

303
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,207
Get the fuck out of my way.
Get out of my way!

304
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,839
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Get out of my fucking way.

305
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,861
Fuck.

306
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,864
Goddamn it.

307
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,520
- Bitch.
- Never!

308
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:40,981
Dude, seriously?

309
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,777
What are you using
my credit card for?

310
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,362
Don't worry about it.
I'll pay you back.

311
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,532
It's just that if you go over
the limit, I'm gonna have to tell--

312
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,619
- Come on!
- That's right.

313
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,414
Are you watching these two fuck,
Garvey?

314
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,500
She's ordering something secret
from the Internet.

315
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,837
How long is it gonna take you
to get ready for Dixon's party?

316
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:07,215
It won't take me long, dip-shit.
I'm not going.

317
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,385
Are you just gonna hang around here
with my dad all night?

318
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,554
He's not gonna be here.

319
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,181
How do you know?

320
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,309
Because whenever you go out,
he goes out.

321
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:21,897
I suspect with a lady friend.

322
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,694
Okay.

323
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,989
Ow! Goddamn. Damn it!

324
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:34,886
Yeah?

325
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,681
I'm here to see Wayne.

326
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,517
Who the fuck are you?

327
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,146
Wayne!

328
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,108
I know you're in here, Wayne! Wayne!

329
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,368
Don't fucking move!

330
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,246
- Take it easy.
- You okay, Liane?

331
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,291
How does he know about Wayne?

332
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,335
I'm the one
who dropped off the money.

333
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,379
I just wanted to talk to him.

334
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,630
Why?

335
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,051
Because I have one, too.

336
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,886
One of what?

337
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,683
One of her.

338
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,539
Hey, Mr. Garvey.

339
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,168
- Where's Jill?
- She went out.

340
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:57,427
- So you brought your dad back, huh?
- Still working on it.

341
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,852
You might want to feed that thing.

342
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,356
Your new dog.

343
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,359
Yeah.

344
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,905
You don't remember, do you?

345
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,701
- What?
- Last night.

346
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,413
Getting the dog.

347
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,624
Of course I remember.

348
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,670
Then what did you say to me
when I bandaged up your hand?

349
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,384
We really like having you here
with us, Aimee.

350
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:40,428
- Do you like it here?
- Yeah.

351
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,765
Good.

352
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,763
It's okay. It's okay.

353
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,351
All right. Go get it.

354
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,415
- Hello?
- Is Reverend Jamison here?

355
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,084
No. May I help you?

356
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,752
Matt!

357
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,964
- Mr. Matt is not here.
- Matt! Matt!

358
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,475
- Where's your phone?
- Why?

359
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,894
Because if I call from mine,
he's not gonna pick up.

360
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,231
Call him right now!

361
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,153
Hello.

362
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,030
Mr. Matt, there's--

363
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:07,158
Matt, it's Kevin Garvey.
Is my father with you?

364
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:10,495
Kevin, I-- No.
What makes you think so?

365
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:14,332
I think so because he was just in
my fucking backyard

366
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,044
digging up a jar full of cash with
one of your goddamn fliers in it!

367
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,133
- Kevin, I--
- Is he with you or not?

368
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:30,557
He's almost ready to see you,
but we need to get something first.

369
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,184
No, you're not getting shit,

370
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:36,187
not until you tell me where you are
right fucking now.

371
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,400
Meet us at Sonny's off Route 17,
90 minutes.

372
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,610
Matt. Matt!

373
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,322
Motherfucker!

374
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:13,350
Jesus, you were there
the night of the raid.

375
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:16,102
Yeah, I was there.

376
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,104
Fuck. So many people.

377
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,774
- Sorry I didn't recognize you, man.
- How did you get out?

378
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,359
One of the tunnels.

379
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,486
Wayne met up with us
at this fucking rest stop.

380
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:28,698
Gave us some cash, a phone,
looked at me, and then said,

381
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:32,452
- "This girl--"
- "This girl, she's everything, yes?"

382
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:37,707
Motherfucker. Word for word, man.

383
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,585
- Which one?
- What?

384
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:44,798
- Which girl? Who are you with?
- Christine.

385
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,217
Is she pregnant?

386
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,763
And the baby is Wayne's?

387
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,348
It's not mine.

388
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,270
How many others
do you think he's got?

389
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,814
Does it matter?

390
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,872
- Did he ever hug you, man?
- No.

391
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:23,670
Because he did it to me,
and it was so fucking real, man.

392
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,884
He took away all my pain.

393
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,144
There's got to be a reason
he didn't tell us about each other.

394
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,106
- He's got to have a plan.
- There's no fucking plan, dude.

395
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,026
Where is she?

396
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,945
- Where is that whore?
- Jesus Christ!

397
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:51,990
Fuck!

398
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,534
- My baby!
- Goddamn it!

399
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,328
He said it would be my baby!

400
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,414
He promised me.

401
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,083
He's the one. He's the only one!

402
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,043
He's the bridge!

403
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,507
- Shh...
- He's the one.

404
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,241
They just got here.
Want us to grab them?

405
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,912
- No, let them come in.
- Copy that.

406
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,133
Kevin.

407
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,387
Reverend, could you give us
a few minutes, please?

408
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,848
- I'll be at the counter.
- Thank you.

409
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,769
Picked your favorite place.

410
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:08,066
Only way I could get you to church
was promise you fries and a shake.

411
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,239
Will you please take these off?

412
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,116
- No.
- Come on.

413
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,786
I saw two units in the parking lot.

414
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,288
I hired that fat-ass
three booths back.

415
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,831
I won't run.

416
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,834
You have my word.

417
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,506
Come on.

418
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,698
What's this?

419
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,038
Son, you need to know,
I wanted to keep you out of this.

420
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:09,294
I tried to change their minds,
but they wouldn't stop.

421
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,297
They would never stop.

422
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,387
I couldn't find it in the library,

423
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:23,600
so I had to go to some asshole
in Gabota that sells them.

424
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,685
May, 1972.

425
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,022
They were very specific.

426
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,774
It had to be this one.

427
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,117
What am I supposed to do with this?

428
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,453
I need you to take it.

429
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,079
Why?

430
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,790
Please, Kevin. Just take--

431
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,918
What fucking difference
does it make, huh?

432
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,131
Oh, God.

433
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,429
You need to accept it.

434
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,515
Dad, what does that even mean?

435
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:12,148
I know you think I'm fucking crazy,
but I'm not.

436
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,192
I'm not, Kevin.

437
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:18,154
What I hear, what they say...

438
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,075
...it is the goddamn truth.

439
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,202
It's the truth, son.

440
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,456
They don't tell me what they don't--

441
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:31,084
Jesus Christ.

442
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,880
I'm trying. This isn't easy.

443
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,175
Okay, I'll tell him.

444
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,973
Listen to me. Just listen to me.

445
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,769
The lucky ones.

446
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,939
They're not needed.

447
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,650
They get to stay sane.

448
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,611
But we....

449
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,742
We're in the fucking game now,
you understand?

450
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:10,123
That whistle blew three years ago,
and you cannot ignore it anymore.

451
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,501
Your services are being requested.

452
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,670
Eyes open, wide awake.

453
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,298
This is your invitation.

454
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:24,846
This is your purpose.
This is what you fucking accept.

455
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,892
So now I have a purpose?

456
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:33,146
Context is everything, son.

457
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:41,237
Where did you go, Dad?

458
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,242
I'm right here.

459
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,953
You left me.

460
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,457
You left me when I needed you.

461
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:58,379
Now you wanna infect me
with whatever it is you got.

462
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:04,385
I don't accept your bullshit.

463
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:09,682
I have responsibilities.
I have commitments.

464
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,561
I'm not gonna leave my family.

465
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,527
You know.

466
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:26,574
Inside you know this is real,
and that makes you a coward.

467
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,159
A coward?

468
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,245
You don't want it,
you don't want what I have,

469
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,039
then I relieve you of it.

470
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,957
- Sit down.
- I relieve you.

471
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:39,462
- Dad, calm down.
- Just don't wake up. Stay asleep.

472
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,088
Just go back to sleep.

473
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:44,258
Don't wake up!
Don't anybody wake up!

474
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:47,553
Go to sleep!
Go back to fucking sleep!

475
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,342
- You'll come see me on Sunday?
- Of course.

476
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,731
They're not gonna let you off
that easy, son.

477
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:58,976
What?

478
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,896
"Said the father, my dear son,

479
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,981
relate not thy vision
to thy brothers,

480
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,775
lest they concoct a plot against--"

481
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,151
Fuck you, Matt.

482
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,319
- Hi.
- Hey.

483
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,091
Hey.

484
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,553
Hey.

485
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,181
Are you okay?

486
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,101
Oh, yeah.

487
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,229
You wanna talk about it?

488
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,710
I think I might be going crazy.

489
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,758
Well, my friend,
you've come to the right place.

490
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,949
Morning.

491
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:26,076
- Morning.
- Morning.

492
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,413
So, were you working all night?

493
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,584
I was actually with a friend.

494
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:37,463
- Oh.
- I think you'd like her.

495
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,049
We've got to find time
to get together soon.

496
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,264
- What is this?
- What?

497
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,516
This.
What the fuck is it doing here?

498
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,311
I ordered it for Grandpa.

499
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,647
- He told you to order this?
- No.

500
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:57,650
He dropped a piece of paper.
What's your problem?

501
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,569
- I don't have a fucking problem.
- What the fuck, Dad?

502
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,171
Tom?

503
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:26,155
Christine?

504
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,324
Hello!

505
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,099
It's a girl.
