1
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,177
I need to cancel.

2
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,013
Just for tomorrow.

3
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,183
Yeah, sure.

4
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,562
You know, that's fine, so....

5
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,023
Okay, okay.
Okay, goodbye.

6
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,860
Hello?

7
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,820
Oh, hi.

8
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,365
No, I have appointments all day.

9
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,662
Oh, yeah, we can set up ourselves.

10
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,248
How many chairs?

11
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,292
Oh, great. Great.

12
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,629
Okay. Okay,
I'll see you after 4:00, then.

13
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,673
Thanks. Bye.

14
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:00,679
- So, how was your run?
- It's fucking hot for October.

15
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:08,604
- Want some French toast?
- Yeah.

16
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,547
Hey, Jill?
Come on, honey. Chop, chop.

17
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,677
They pushed my afternoon sessions
so I can meet the rental guys.

18
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,555
- All you have to do is get the cake.
- Yeah, okay.

19
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,932
- Do you think he knows?
- No way.

20
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,561
Jill, I'm waiting.
Hey, when does Tommy get back?

21
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,896
He said he had a morning class
and he'd come after that.

22
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,732
- All right.
- So I'll see you at noon.

23
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,484
- You have the breeder's address?
- The what?

24
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,238
The breeder?
For the puppy?

25
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,241
- It has to be today?
- Yeah, we have to go today,

26
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,076
otherwise we go on the wait list
and lose our deposit.

27
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,746
All right, okay.
Noon. I'll be there.

28
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,094
Have a good day.

29
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,601
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

30
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,994
Don't. Please.

31
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,788
Mommy attack.

32
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,292
- Yeah!
- Yeah, way too early.

33
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,420
- God.
- Way too early, guys.

34
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,671
Way too early.

35
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,256
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

36
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,093
Hi.

37
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,388
- Hi, hi.
- I love you.

38
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,938
My bunny is really soft and...

39
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:44,069
...its ears are, like, this big
and it's pretty big.

40
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,614
He only eats cheese crackers
even if he's--

41
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,991
Get your hand out of the box, miss.

42
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,994
- And he also eats carrots.
- No.

43
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,205
Jeremy.

44
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,584
Don't feed the dog.

45
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,045
- Hey, Dad.
- Yo.

46
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,967
- You look nice.
- Today's my interview.

47
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,469
Today's your interview.

48
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,471
You said you could take the kids
to school.

49
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,975
Of course, I'm taking the kids
to school, right, kids?

50
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,810
What's an interview?

51
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,521
- Mommy's getting a job.
- Trying to get a job.

52
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,857
Do you want it?

53
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,319
- Yeah, I do.
- Then you're gonna get it.

54
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,364
Come on.

55
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,702
- Mommy's getting a job.
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

56
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,329
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
- Hey. Mommy.

57
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,665
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

58
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,869
- Hello?
- Laurie, hi.

59
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,038
Dr. Singley.
How are you?

60
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,706
Oh, hi. Fine.

61
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,875
I was told
you canceled your appointment?

62
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,754
Yeah, yeah, my daughter
has a science fair and I wanted to--

63
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,548
I really think it's important
for you to come in tomorrow.

64
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,051
We're reaching the point
of no return.

65
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,470
I know. I just....

66
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,226
I need to talk to my husband.

67
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,728
Well, you should do that.

68
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,732
- And then you'll be in tomorrow?
- Yes.

69
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,442
Good. See you then.

70
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,753
Good morning.

71
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,922
Patti, you ready to come in?

72
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,853
- It's a cat?
- Yeah.

73
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:29,150
But it has a pop tart for its body,
and it's just shooting through space,

74
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,611
and it has rainbows coming out
of its butt,

75
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,905
and it's just really happy about it.

76
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,159
I don't get it.

77
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,997
No, Dad, you don't.

78
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,795
And come home
straight after school.

79
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,298
Your mom and I need help
setting up for the party.

80
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,968
He knows, you know.
It's not gonna be a surprise.

81
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,138
Yeah, I know, I know.
Just please don't tell your mom.

82
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,979
- You smell like cigarettes.
- What?

83
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,399
Bye.

84
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,891
What happened?

85
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,809
I don't know.
They just all came running out.

86
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,228
It's a monster!

87
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,892
Is it gone?

88
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,272
- What was it?
- It was a deer.

89
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,251
I think something terrible's
about to happen.

90
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,880
Tell me what that feels like.

91
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,385
- What it feels like?
- Yeah.

92
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,303
I mean...

93
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,724
...why is this time different?

94
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,061
Because you've said this before
and we're still here.

95
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,981
Those times...

96
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,985
...they were like tremors.

97
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,779
This...

98
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,198
...this is the big one.

99
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,453
Like the world is gonna end.

100
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,790
Then tell me how it feels.

101
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,464
Like a hand is inside my chest.

102
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:43,261
And it's squeezing my heart
tighter and tighter.

103
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,973
And he won't let me go
until it's over.

104
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,810
- "He"?
- What?

105
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,813
"He" won't let go?

106
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,067
- It's not about that.
- It isn't?

107
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,736
- No, no.
- It's not about Neil

108
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,488
telling you to leave your own house?

109
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,742
He paid for it.

110
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,161
It's his house.

111
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,457
That's not how it works, Patti.

112
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,670
But he told you to go, so you went.

113
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,594
And all those abusive things
he said to you?

114
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,306
That's what makes you feel like
the world is ending.

115
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,851
Because instead
of ignoring those things,

116
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,561
you believe them.

117
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,105
You absorb them.

118
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,403
Well, I guess I better
shit 'em back out.

119
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,657
Maybe you should.

120
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,451
Maybe you should put them
in a bag,

121
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,953
and write Neil's name on it,

122
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,915
and just drop it right back off
on his doorstep.

123
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,167
Come on.

124
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,088
Well, if it'll stop the world
from ending, why the hell not?

125
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,967
Nothing's gonna stop that.

126
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,429
I know why you're telling jokes

127
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,640
because you can feel it, too,
can't you?

128
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,059
I know you can.

129
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,895
Something's wrong...

130
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,356
...inside you.

131
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,698
Sorry, Patti, that's just not true.

132
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,121
There's nothing wrong with me.

133
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,422
Well, you're on the council
but nobody knows who you are.

134
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,756
Buddy Menlo is the incumbent.

135
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,758
He's popular,
he has built-in name recognition

136
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,093
and we're a month out
from the election.

137
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,262
So if I'm being honest,
barring a miracle,

138
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,930
I don't think you stand a chance.

139
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,140
Uh-huh.

140
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,101
And why should I hire you
if you can't help me win?

141
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,312
Because I think you have
some progressive ideas for the town--

142
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,938
Oh, fuck my progressive ideas.

143
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:03,276
Why do you want to do this,
"Nora Durst"?

144
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,364
Because...

145
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,535
...I want to use my brain
for more than figuring out

146
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,121
which juice box
is certified organic.

147
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,082
I want....

148
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,631
I need something for myself.

149
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:33,139
I know I'm not running
for mayor of New York City...

150
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:38,019
...but for the next four weeks,
I need this to be your priority.

151
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:42,190
And what does that mean
for the, um... juice boxes?

152
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,858
As far as you're concerned,
for the next four weeks,

153
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,485
I don't have a family.

154
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,616
Councilwoman.

155
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,327
I'm in the middle of an interview.

156
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,245
You coming to my thing tonight?

157
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,915
You're not supposed to know
you're having a thing tonight.

158
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,669
And yet I do know.
You coming or not?

159
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,254
I'm in the middle of an interview.

160
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,174
Hey.

161
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,511
- You tell her she could beat Buddy?
- Nope.

162
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,013
Hire her.

163
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:17,350
Now get the fuck out of here,
Man of the Year.

164
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,529
We're just friends, so....

165
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,490
Moorland, you've got first
and Broadway.

166
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,283
And don't any of you think
you dodged a bullet

167
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,411
because you'll all be getting
traffic control

168
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,746
until Con Ed's done
with the gas lines,

169
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,915
which should be in about a week.

170
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:45,086
Now, in other good news,
or bad news,

171
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,588
this heat wave's gonna continue.

172
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,299
So water restriction
is still in place

173
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,801
which means you issue a ticket

174
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,513
to anybody who's sprinkling
their lawns between 6:00 and 10:00.

175
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,267
And it looks like
we've got ourselves a deer problem.

176
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,311
Reports of the fuckers
getting stuck inside buildings.

177
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,397
One wandered
into the Biggie superstore,

178
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,442
another jammed through
Rosalie Darmody's baby shower--

179
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,068
Think it's just one.

180
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:14,073
- Sorry?
- Deer. I think it's just one.

181
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,162
- Why do you think that?
- I saw it this morning.

182
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,747
At the school?

183
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,124
No, I just missed it at the school.
Before that.

184
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,085
Just a theory, Chief,
maybe this thing's in heat

185
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,254
and just wants to fuck
the lieutenant.

186
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,256
Fuck you, Lou.

187
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,925
It doesn't matter to me
if it's deer singular

188
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,969
or deer fucking plural.

189
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,597
You are authorized to put it down.

190
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,348
Well, we don't need to kill it.

191
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:48,066
If it's dangerous and unstable,
yes, we do.

192
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,650
We get tranq guns
from animal control.

193
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,569
If we see it, we knock it out,

194
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,363
bring it back to the woods,
let it go.

195
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,657
- Let it go?
- Yes.

196
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,163
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

197
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,290
You get a tranq gun,

198
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,293
I'll have dispatch inform you
of any sightings,

199
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,713
and you get there before anyone
with an actual weapon....

200
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,883
...hallelujah.
Set Bambi free.

201
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,636
Good?

202
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,846
Yes, good.

203
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,807
Fantastic.

204
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,478
Now, I hope to not see any of you
any time soon, especially tonight,

205
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:29,023
as I hate fucking parties.
Dismissed.

206
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,743
- Hello?
- Dad.

207
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,121
Tommy, you okay?

208
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,623
I think I fucked up.

209
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,917
Where are you?

210
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,298
He's mostly sobered up.
Guy's not pressing charges.

211
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,675
He will if there's a next time.

212
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,802
- I appreciate it.
- No problem.

213
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,346
Come on.

214
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,769
- Sorry.
- Glad you called me.

215
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,149
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

216
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,446
Hey. Come on. It's okay.

217
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,536
What did he do?

218
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,667
This the house?

219
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,044
Please don't. It was my fault.

220
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,713
- Dad--
- It's okay.

221
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,214
Gonna talk to him.

222
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,233
Would you get your dad
for me, please?

223
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,784
Yeah?

224
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,580
- Shit.
- You know who I am?

225
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,916
Look, man, he keeps coming here.

226
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,626
- What happened?
- He was drunk.

227
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,711
This is the third time.
I already told him--

228
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,004
What happened?

229
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,506
He doesn't understand
that this is not something

230
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,342
- that I'm interested in.
- Did you touch him?

231
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,594
- He tried to come into my house.
- Did you touch him?

232
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,262
All I did was push him back--

233
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,268
If you touch my kid again,
I will fucking kill you.

234
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,365
It's okay.

235
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,128
Why'd you have to tell me?

236
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,009
Your mother thought it would be
the same as lying if we didn't.

237
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,932
I'm your father, not him.

238
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,979
I know.

239
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,401
Why do you need to keep doing this?

240
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,153
Because he shouldn't get to pretend
like it never happened.

241
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,743
He did a terrible thing to you
and your mother.

242
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,542
Sometimes you have to pretend.

243
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,641
Well, well, looks like
someone chose you.

244
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,853
Is that the mother?

245
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,147
- Her third litter.
- Aw...

246
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,858
They seem so young
to be away from her.

247
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,154
It's actually completely natural.
They don't need her anymore.

248
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,583
I'm sorry.
It's my husband.

249
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,002
He's not coming.

250
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,296
Just bring him home.

251
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,090
I promise,
the minute your husband sees him,

252
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,425
he'll fall in love.

253
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,726
Sorry.

254
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,065
They're wonderful, aren't they?

255
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,873
Hey, Jill, honey,
you got to clear off the table.

256
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,125
The food's gonna be here
and I need to set up.

257
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,543
Almost done.

258
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,589
- Want me to help you?
- No, thanks.

259
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,261
So, I know you have
your presentation tomorrow,

260
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,429
and I really wanna be there,

261
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,474
but I have an appointment
and I tried to--

262
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,768
That's okay.
You weren't there last year.

263
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,606
I'm a terrible mother.

264
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,611
- There's no need to be dramatic.
- I'm not being dramatic.

265
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,782
Come here. You're the best mom
in the whole world.

266
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,325
The best mom ever.

267
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,868
Hello?

268
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,456
- Tell Mom she's the best.
- Well, she is the best.

269
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,668
- Where's the cake?
- Right behind me.

270
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:46,298
You're home. You're home.

271
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,302
Hey, what are you two
doing together?

272
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,638
The car broke down
so I went and picked him up.

273
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,308
Yeah.

274
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:01,814
Looking good, Billy Ray!

275
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,817
Feeling good, Louis.

276
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,403
Okay, team.
Time to party.

277
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,072
Up.

278
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,660
Silver fox approaching the door.
Repeat, silver fox approaching.

279
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,995
Copy that.

280
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,706
He's here.

281
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,500
All right. Everyone,
get down, get down. He's here.

282
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,211
- And quiet, stay quiet.
- He knows.

283
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,005
Oh, fuck off, Lou.

284
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,342
Kevin's out back,
making some drinks.

285
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,636
You can just head
through the kitchen.

286
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,476
- Surprise!
- Oh! Oh!

287
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,022
Motherfuckers!

288
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,862
Hey.

289
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,494
Hey, Tommy.
Come here, college boy.

290
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,416
- Man hug!
- Man hug!

291
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,543
Man hug!

292
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,886
Hey, Mary, how you doing?
Thank you so much for coming.

293
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,764
- He was so surprised.
- I think he was.

294
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:18,891
Hey, Jill.

295
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,560
You need to take that over
to the bar, honey.

296
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,812
- Who picked this music?
- Old people.

297
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,314
Take it to the bar.

298
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,114
Beautiful house.

299
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,825
Kevin, your wife must do very well
for herself.

300
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,911
Well, fuck you very much.

301
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,913
You better not talk to me like that
when I'm mayor.

302
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,665
- I'm sure. I won't.
- Okay.

303
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,584
Wait, wait.
He didn't tell you about the deer?

304
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:46,919
What deer?

305
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,504
The one that your husband wants
to rescue

306
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,422
and free back into the wilderness.

307
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,342
Apparently, they've got
a very special relationship.

308
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,177
It's confused.

309
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,888
It just keeps trapping itself
inside of buildings. It's....

310
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,809
Aw, poor thing.

311
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,441
Thank you, God,
for Mommy and Daddy--

312
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,153
- ...Kylie and Bubba.
- Jeremy, stop.

313
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,281
- Prayers are stupid.
- Don't say that.

314
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,448
Go pick out a book.

315
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,325
I'll come read to you
in ten minutes, okay?

316
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,287
Come on. Up.

317
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,458
- Maybe it lost its family.
- Who did?

318
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,835
The deer.

319
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,962
Maybe it's looking for them
at our school.

320
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,632
Maybe, but he's not gonna come back
ever again, okay?

321
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,509
I promise.
You're safe.

322
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,472
- Good night, my love.
- Night, Mommy.

323
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,233
- You can turn it all the way.
- Are you sure?

324
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,944
I'm not scared anymore.

325
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,878
- Long day.
- You said 6:00.

326
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,005
One of the accounts fell apart.

327
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,467
I can come home early tomorrow.

328
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,054
- Did I miss the window?
- No, go on in. She's still up.

329
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,681
- Fantastic.
- It went great.

330
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,311
My interview.

331
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,856
Awesome.

332
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:41,617
So, the Honorable Judge Hader
sidles up to me

333
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,619
before the ceremony.

334
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,538
He's there every year,
like he invented the fucking thing.

335
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:51,210
And he says, "Congratulations
on this great honor."

336
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,380
So, I looked that cocksucker
right in the eyes and said,

337
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,883
"Can't be that great.
They gave one to you."

338
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,576
Everybody? Everybody.

339
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:29,748
If I may, on behalf
of the Civic Clergy Association,

340
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,459
I feel obligated to share with you

341
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:36,422
why I nominated our guest of honor
for Mapleton Man of the Year.

342
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,757
The answer?

343
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,176
I couldn't nominate myself.

344
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:48,100
But seriously, this man,
well, he's humble, he's gracious,

345
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,019
he doesn't like me saying
how generous he is

346
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,938
or what he's done for the church,

347
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:57,359
what he's done for me
or the people of this town.

348
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,613
But, hell, I just did.

349
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:05,117
- Hail to the chief.
- Hail to the chief.

350
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,871
Hear, hear.

351
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,331
This is a part of something

352
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:15,002
that Chief used to read to me
when I was a kid.

353
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:25,053
"A man said to the universe,
'Sir, I exist.'

354
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,807
'However, ' the universe replied,

355
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:33,979
'the fact has not created in me
a sense of obligation."'

356
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:39,234
A lot of people think that
the world owes them something.

357
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:44,239
But you, Dad, you built your life...

358
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:49,745
...and mine... on your own.

359
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:58,504
Now look at me, you know,
and look what I got.

360
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,845
To family.

361
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,723
To family!

362
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,371
You're just
asking to get caught.

363
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,292
Oh shit.

364
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:21,086
- Thought you quit.
- Taking a break from quitting.

365
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,638
That was a beautiful speech.

366
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,434
I almost believed you meant it.

367
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,942
I think something's fucking wrong
with me.

368
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,653
I think you're right.

369
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,783
Why isn't it enough?

370
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,498
Because every man rebels
against the idea

371
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,751
that this is fucking it.

372
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:07,507
Fights windmills,
saves fucking damsels,

373
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,469
all in search of greater purpose.

374
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,562
You have no greater purpose.

375
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:27,402
Because it is enough.

376
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,996
So, cut the shit, okay?

377
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,223
You know, I was thinking
maybe we should hold off

378
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,641
on getting a dog.

379
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:03,814
- Really?
- Yeah, it's just a lot.

380
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:09,903
I started crying
at the breeder's today.

381
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:19,079
I just got overwhelmed.
I don't think the timing is right.

382
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,083
No, let's do it.

383
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:24,960
Tomorrow.

384
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,130
Come on.
We'll surprise the kids.

385
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,590
Come on.

386
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,555
And I'll help,
so you don't get overwhelmed.

387
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,978
- Okay?
- Okay.

388
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,257
Did you sleep okay?

389
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,552
Great.

390
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,100
I'm gonna run.

391
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,365
- What time is it?
- It's early.

392
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,992
You don't have to get up.

393
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,120
It's okay. I'm up.

394
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,964
Hey.
You got a new one.

395
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,636
- I like it.
- You should get one, too.

396
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:04,142
Maybe "Thug Life" on my neck.
Something really subtle.

397
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,728
Perfect.

398
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,773
God.

399
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,361
- I'm sorry.
- About what?

400
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,697
Dad didn't tell you?

401
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,367
No.

402
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:26,164
Oh boy.
I went to see Michael.

403
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,253
Oh.

404
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,382
You're not gonna ask why?

405
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,593
I understand why.

406
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,349
It's okay.
I could just forget about him.

407
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,685
Don't do that.

408
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,939
- Why not?
- Because...

409
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,401
...I can tell you
as a trained professional...

410
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,696
...it doesn't work.

411
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:43,366
- Are you ready?
- Excuse me?

412
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:51,249
- I think he's someone else.
- Okay.

413
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,627
I'm sorry.
I thought you were someone else.

414
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,850
- Laurie.
- Yeah?

415
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,651
You are never gonna believe
what just happened to me.

416
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:07,367
You know, the gas lines
Con Edison's putting in?

417
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,370
A manhole cover just exploded
right in front of me.

418
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,832
Missed me by, I don't know, ten feet.

419
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,500
Did you just smoke?

420
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,423
- What?
- You smell like cigarettes.

421
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,050
I mean, I don't really care.
You're the one that wanted to quit.

422
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,012
Just be honest, this time.

423
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,766
- "This time"?
- Tommy told me about Michael.

424
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,522
So what? You're angry
because I didn't say something?

425
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,940
Why didn't you?

426
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,484
Because it's not my fucking place.

427
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,863
What is your place, Kevin?

428
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:50,201
Is it here?
Be honest.

429
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,832
You don't want me to be honest.

430
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,209
Yes, I do.

431
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,382
Okay, um...

432
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,136
I smoked...

433
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,265
...and I don't want a dog.

434
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:19,898
Why didn't you just tell me?

435
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,485
Because you wanted it.

436
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,170
Hello?

437
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,384
Just now?

438
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,470
Is it still there?

439
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,015
Text me the address.
I'm on my way over.

440
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,310
It's the deer.

441
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,440
It's trapped.

442
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,819
Better go save it.

443
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,447
Fuck you, Laurie.

444
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,380
Is it still in the house?

445
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,966
Yeah, walked right through the
screen door into the living room.

446
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,945
Ma'am, sir, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave the house.

447
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,948
That's not gonna happen.

448
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,662
It's upstairs?

449
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,430
It went outside.

450
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,068
- My God.
- You okay?

451
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,904
He came out of nowhere.

452
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,986
I have been holding for 20 minutes.

453
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,989
No, no, no. No, don't.
I-- No.

454
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,407
Oh, God.

455
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:08,853
Laurie?

456
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:13,691
- Hi. Mary Jamison.
- Of course. Hi.

457
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,736
- Such a beautiful party last night.
- Thank you, thank you.

458
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,780
It was great to have you
and Matt there.

459
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,658
He's in there right now.

460
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,536
Is everything okay?

461
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,289
They think they saw something.

462
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,042
Oh, I'm so sorry.

463
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,753
Last night, he was so....

464
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,547
I had no idea.

465
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,467
Yeah, well, Matt knows
how to put on a brave face.

466
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,177
He was sick as a kid.

467
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,222
We go through this
every couple of years.

468
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,933
I mean, he does.

469
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,185
He never lets me go in with him.

470
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,107
He's scared.

471
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,402
He doesn't want you to see him
like that.

472
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,696
But I do see it.

473
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,492
I'd rather us be afraid together.

474
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:23,136
- Let's get drunk.
- You get drunk. I'll drive.

475
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,037
Yeah, I know.
Going to hell.

476
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,833
Think I can get one of those?

477
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,627
Yeah.

478
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,590
Here.

479
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,221
Hey, hey. Here, I got it.

480
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,608
I mean, it came out of nowhere.

481
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:23,613
- It didn't belong here.
- Well, neither do I.

482
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:27,158
I'm here for a conference and I was
trying to get back to my hotel.

483
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,161
Missed my turn.

484
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:44,300
- Lady, you need a lift?
- Can I just get a minute?

485
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,677
Sorry, but I got to go but
if you need a ride or something--

486
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,012
I'll take her.

487
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,514
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

488
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,015
- You sure?
- Yeah.

489
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,899
- Give it to me!
- No!

490
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,067
- It's mine!
- Kids.

491
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:04,028
- You don't need it anymore!
- Give her the blanket.

492
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,031
Two hands with the big-girl cup,
please. That's the deal.

493
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:14,372
- I'm hungry, Mom, I'm hungry.
- I'm hungry, too.

494
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,541
Stop, please.
No phones at the table.

495
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,210
- Well, yours is out, too.
- I'm waiting to hear about the job.

496
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,546
- Well, this is important, too.
- I want food!

497
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:25,091
I want food!
I want food!

498
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,051
- It's coming, buddy.
- I want food.

499
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,970
- Jeremy.
- I want food!

500
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,472
- Hey, cut it out.
- I want food!

501
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,267
We'd like to
welcome all parents and students

502
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,060
to our annual science fair.

503
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,896
Please see the door
for a list of all projects

504
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,064
and their locations.

505
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,567
I'm not gonna lie
but I think the kid over there

506
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,193
cracked cold fusion.

507
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:54,120
- That looks terrible.
- It's awesome.

508
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,082
God.

509
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:06,132
So, Mom and Dad,
what's going on there?

510
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:10,011
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

511
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,435
I think he's gonna leave.

512
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,188
Hey, kids.
Who wants to help make a circuit?

513
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,025
We're gonna make a circuit.

514
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:27,987
We would absolutely love
to make a circuit, wouldn't we?

515
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,573
No.

516
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,632
- Thanks.
- Sure. No problem.

517
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,970
I don't know why I just....

518
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,476
I feel sad.

519
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,688
I mean, it was a fucking animal.

520
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,866
Are you a good guy?

521
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,330
What?

522
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,125
Are you a good guy?

523
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,177
No.

524
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,689
You wanna come in?

525
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:53,030
- Any nausea?
- Comes and goes.

526
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,533
If we move forward,

527
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:58,869
I'd like you to meet with a counselor
to discuss your options.

528
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,330
I'd like to take a look.
Is that all right with you?

529
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,799
- I haven't told my husband yet.
- Is it his?

530
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:15,302
Yes.
Of course.

531
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,324
Okay, just relax.

532
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:44,999
There it is.

533
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,252
Looks good.

534
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:51,464
Perfectly healthy.

535
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,217
Do you wanna hear the heartbeat?

536
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:06,705
Goddamn it!
I said, "two hands"!

537
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,708
Hello? Hello?

538
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,382
What was that?
