1
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,121
You want something to drink?

2
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,293
Water?
Coffee?

3
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,214
Drano?

4
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,930
Holiday dance is tomorrow night.

5
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,808
Fundraiser, for the new library.

6
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,397
I take it you don't give a shit
about the new library.

7
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,152
Uh-huh.

8
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,909
I wanna ask you a favor.

9
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,832
Give us a little break tomorrow.

10
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,128
You know, don't show up
with your people and your signs

11
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,380
and your "Stop wasting your breath"
bullshit.

12
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,342
If you come,
I'm not gonna protect you.

13
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,344
It's the holidays.

14
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,514
People wanna drink.
They wanna relax,

15
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,349
blow off a little steam,

16
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,352
spend some time with their families.

17
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,633
What the fuck does that mean?

18
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,087
Hey there, Chief.

19
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,299
Did it work?

20
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,094
Yeah. They'll be there.

21
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,680
- Fucking briar patch, huh?
- Fucking briar patch.

22
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,393
Make sure everything's ready
at the school for the walkthrough.

23
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,645
Tell the mayor to be there.
I don't want any fucking pushback

24
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,147
- when I arrest these assholes.
- Copy that, Chief.

25
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,649
Anything else?

26
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,111
Oh, it looks like somebody stole
the baby from the Nativity.

27
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,279
You know, Jesus.

28
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,325
- Am I supposed to give a shit?
- Uh, no.

29
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,535
That's correct, Dennis.

30
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,129
The number you have
dialed is no longer in service

31
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,756
and there is no new number.

32
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,468
The number you have dialed
is no longer in service

33
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,262
and there is no new number.

34
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,225
What the fuck, Tommy?

35
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,170
He'll call.

36
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,466
- When?
- When we need him to.

37
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,010
It's been six fucking weeks,
Christine.

38
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,429
I think we fucking need him to.

39
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,432
He'll call.

40
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,059
Why are you in my dream?

41
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,656
Why are you in my dream?

42
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,533
Are you Christine?

43
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,119
- Um...
- Do you know this guy?

44
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,205
I talked to him a couple of times.

45
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,165
You walk over the dead.

46
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,666
Hey, step the fuck back, man.

47
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,543
- Hey! Hey!
- They're all in white!

48
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,296
- You walk over the dead!
- Get off of her! Get off of her!

49
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,964
- They're all in white!
- Stop!

50
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,842
They're all in white!

51
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,887
They're all in white!

52
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,433
Fuck!

53
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,357
They're all in white!

54
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,653
- Get off me! Get off me!
- Call the police!

55
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,239
- Tell him to fuck off!
- Call the cops! Call the police!

56
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,449
- Don't touch her!
- I know!

57
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,702
I know what's inside you!

58
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,914
I know what's inside you!

59
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,374
Come on, Christine.
Let's get out of here.

60
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,751
Come on! Come on!

61
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,753
I know what's inside you.

62
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,061
Ooh, that for me?

63
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,773
- Nope.
- Yeah, it is. What'd you get me?

64
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,151
- What'd you get me?
- The greatest gift of all, love.

65
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,948
Found them.

66
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,246
Those are grandpa's, not ours.

67
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,212
I'll look for the others
when I get home tonight, okay?

68
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,966
I tried calling your brother.

69
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,759
Did he get a new cell phone?

70
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,137
I don't know.

71
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,222
Well, when's the last time
you talked to him?

72
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,474
A couple of months ago.

73
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,060
He's still in San Francisco, right?

74
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,604
I don't know.

75
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,023
- Well, what do you know?
- I told you I haven't talked to him.

76
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,817
- Stop copping me.
- I'm not copping--

77
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,528
I'm allowed to care about
where your brother is.

78
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,323
Okay, I get it.
Jesus, Dad.

79
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,201
Hey, speaking of Jesus,
big deal at school, Mr. Garvey.

80
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,495
- Everybody's talking about it.
- What?

81
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,499
The baby, how it just vanished
from the manger.

82
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,086
It didn't vanish.
It got stolen.

83
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,340
So does that mean it's the police's
responsibility to get it back?

84
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,133
Well, Aimee, as the Chief of Police,

85
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,178
I would say that that might be
a misuse of our resources.

86
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,641
- They're just gonna replace it.
- That's cheating.

87
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,560
Excuse me?

88
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,856
You can't just get a new one.
It's sacred.

89
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,657
Jill, did you steal the baby Jesus?

90
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,995
- That's sick.
- It is sick.

91
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,500
Okay.
I have an actual job to go to.

92
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,711
So, I just wanna be clear that I'm
not gonna be doing anything about...

93
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,006
...whatever this is.

94
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,551
Cool. Don't.

95
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,481
Enjoying my sandwich?

96
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,076
All right. Listen up or else, we're
gonna have another fucking riot.

97
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,954
Gym only has three entrances.
We're not posting on any of them.

98
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,288
- Yeah, you got it?
- So where are we?

99
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:51,543
We are gonna be in the parking lot,
unmarked cars, waiting.

100
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,254
And if the GR sets foot
on school property,

101
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,506
we're gonna arrest them
for criminal trespass.

102
00:11:56,674 --> 00:12:01,344
We're gonna scatter two-man teams,
there, there, there and there.

103
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,430
We have four more in the vans.

104
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,724
As soon as they come
onto school grounds, we move.

105
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,684
Miranda, Zip-Cuffs...

106
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,229
Hang on.
Give me a minute.

107
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,566
What?
How do you spell that?

108
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:19,571
A-F-O-R-D-A, baby boy,

109
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,615
20 inches, the white one.

110
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:26,578
Obviously the fucking white one,
Marlene. Fuck. Goodbye.

111
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,247
Did you know somebody stole
the baby Jesus?

112
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,791
- Yeah.
- All you have to do is run over

113
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,294
to the Biggie Superstore
and pick a new one up.

114
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,296
A new one?

115
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,090
For fuck's sake, Kevin.
It's not the actual baby Jesus.

116
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,884
Then you fucking do it.

117
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,262
Can you give the Chief and I
a moment?

118
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,474
Here's what you're gonna do.

119
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:52,520
Get the fucking baby, open the box,
strip it naked,

120
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,607
scruff it up so you can say
that you found it in a ditch,

121
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,067
or a dumpster, or something.

122
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,903
And why would I do that?

123
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,114
Because you need a win, Kevin.

124
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,036
Fuck.

125
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,998
Somebody stole it.
Now, we're gonna get it back.

126
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,917
And check the bank
that faces the Nativity,

127
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,836
see if we can pull
last night's camera feed.

128
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,005
- Are you serious?
- Yes, Dennis. I am serious.

129
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,091
So should I make that
the priority or--

130
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,595
No. The dance is still the priority
but I would like to stop dealing

131
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,347
with the goddamned
baby fucking Jesus.

132
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,808
Fuck.

133
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,227
Fuck.

134
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,484
Fuck.

135
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,075
Hey, Chief. You okay?
Are you there?

136
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,452
Chief?

137
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:36,374
Hey, Chief. You okay?
Chief.

138
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,842
All right,
thank you so much.

139
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,220
I'll be with you in a minute.

140
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,931
- Hey, you want a bull's-eye, man?
- No, thanks, dude.

141
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,517
It's so the Creator can find us,
you know, for next time.

142
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,185
Hey, good luck with that.

143
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,567
- How much longer?
- I don't know.

144
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,530
- What did you say to him?
- What?

145
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,240
The naked guy who attacked you,

146
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,159
you said you talked to him
before he went batshit.

147
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,454
- What'd you say?
- I don't remember.

148
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,459
- Did you talk about Wayne?
- Maybe.

149
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:24,130
Okay, you can't talk
about the ranch, Christine, okay?

150
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,301
It isn't my fault he attacked me.

151
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:32,430
It is your fault
because you can't tell strangers

152
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,349
that you're pregnant
with Wayne's baby.

153
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,143
I didn't tell him!
It was in his dream!

154
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,188
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

155
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,689
Shh...

156
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:45,693
From now on, you keep
your fucking mouth shut, okay?

157
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,487
Not a fucking word.

158
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,158
This will be a little cold.

159
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,421
So, you haven't been to see
a doctor before now?

160
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,798
No.

161
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,425
So no prenatal care, vitamins,
anything like that?

162
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,677
No.

163
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,933
There's the heart right there.

164
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,146
It looks like you're at about
12 weeks, give or take.

165
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,194
So the baby's okay?

166
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,698
You wanna tell me what happened?

167
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,619
- A guy attacked her.
- A guy?

168
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,871
Yeah, a guy.
I mean, he came out of nowhere.

169
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,415
He was on drugs or something.

170
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,793
- Did you call the police?
- Uh, no.

171
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,719
I had to hit him
to get him off her.

172
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,763
He just ran away.
I wanted to get her here.

173
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,392
- Are you the father?
- Just a friend.

174
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,774
The fetus looks normal
but I wanna admit you to maternity

175
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,527
and do a few more tests,
be on the safe side.

176
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,241
Just stay put, okay?

177
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,172
Get up, we're leaving.
Come on, get up.

178
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,381
What?

179
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:34,093
She thinks I did this to you.
Get up! Come on! Let's go!

180
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,971
Say it wasn't my fault.

181
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,100
It wasn't your fucking fault!
Now, come on!

182
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,935
You have to mean it.

183
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,147
It isn't your fucking fault!
Come on!

184
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,484
Don't tell them anything.

185
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,236
Call security.

186
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:56,491
Hey! Hey! Hey, stop!

187
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,664
Hey, come on, man.

188
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,004
On the other side.

189
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,589
He's entering the door
to the north stairwell.

190
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,153
Dude. Dude.

191
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,616
- Dude. I'm driving.
- Dude, no, no.

192
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,243
I think he wants us to pull over,
man.

193
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,162
- Pull over.
- Going. I'm going.

194
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,335
Shit.

195
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,504
Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.

196
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,181
Hey, Officer. Sorry.

197
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,850
We didn't know you were a cop...

198
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,561
...because you usually have
those flashy things--

199
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,521
You two hang out with my daughter,
right?

200
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,900
- Jill Garvey?
- Yeah. Sure.

201
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,443
She's awesome.

202
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,530
Did she steal the baby
out of the Nativity scene?

203
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,407
What?

204
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,742
I've got security video.

205
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,870
And one of the suspects
was wearing a hoodie.

206
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,542
That's profiling.

207
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,045
Which one of you
is the fucking smart one?

208
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,633
You were a part of this
and we all know that

209
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,802
but your dreams of getting high
in college will die

210
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,888
because you'll have an arrest
on your fucking transcript.

211
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,891
But if that baby is returned to me,
no questions will be asked.

212
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,143
Understood?

213
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,855
- We don't get high--
- Understood?

214
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,151
Yeah.

215
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,779
Have a nice day.

216
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,455
Dude, do not Instagram that.

217
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,540
The cops can trace that shit.

218
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,923
You're gonna get busted, Jill.
Your dad already knows you took it.

219
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,759
- Did you tell him I took it?
- No.

220
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,344
But he knows.

221
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,932
Whatever.
He doesn't care anyway.

222
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,186
What the fuck are you doing?

223
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:34,440
As our esteemed guest was unjustly
crucified by the Romans,

224
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,945
I, milady, am bestowing unto him
a Roman soldier's helmet.

225
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,405
- What is that?
- You will find out.

226
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,783
Dude.

227
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,243
- God.
- Don't.

228
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:49,288
My God.
Get your balls off the Son of God.

229
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,501
- Fuck.
- We're bringing him back, right?

230
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,878
- What?
- Your dad's obviously looking for it

231
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,339
and he has enough shit
on his plate, you know.

232
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,552
Hey. Give me that.

233
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,558
We're gonna need some gasoline.

234
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,645
Fuck, yeah.

235
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,983
You are
a fucking genius, Garvey.

236
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:23,155
Son of God, King of Kings,

237
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,324
Lamb of Lambs.

238
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,035
I anoint thee.

239
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,860
Light him up, Garvey.

240
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,868
Light him up!
Light him up!

241
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,579
Light him up!
Light him up!

242
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,582
Light him up!
Light him up!

243
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,793
Light him up!
Light him up!

244
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,546
Light him up!
Light him up!

245
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,511
What the fuck was that?

246
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,597
Go fuck yourselves.

247
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,810
- Go fuck ourselves!
- Go fuck ourselves!

248
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,980
Go fuck ourselves!
Go fuck ourselves!

249
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,775
Go fuck ourselves!
Go fuck ourselves!

250
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:44,070
Go fuck ourselves!
Go fuck ourselves!

251
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,989
Go fuck ourselves!
Go fuck ourselves!

252
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:50,993
Go fuck ourselves!
Go fuck ourselves!

253
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,543
Clever.
Clever.

254
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,893
Okay.

255
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,980
Now's your chance.

256
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,652
You want me to trust you?

257
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,448
You want me to give my life
for that girl?

258
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,368
Then you need to let me know why.

259
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,830
You have to let me know why.

260
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,338
I wanna go home.

261
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,096
Last chance.

262
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,643
Fuck you.

263
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,407
Hello? Wayne?

264
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,118
Have you lost someone?
- What?

265
00:24:56,286 --> 00:25:00,748
So many of us were affected
by the events of October 14th.

266
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,376
Even now, after all this time,
we're still struggling.

267
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,548
Still looking for help
but not knowing where to turn.

268
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,760
If you or anyone you know
has suffered loss

269
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,929
as a result of the Sudden Departure,

270
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,723
please hold
for a Loved Ones Representative.

271
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:22,353
You're fucking good, Wayne.
That's a real fucking good one.

272
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,567
Hello? What's it gonna be? Sir?

273
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,837
- I'm Meg. We met the other day and--
- No, I remember.

274
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,637
- Do you wanna come in the house?
- Yes, thank you.

275
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,892
You can smoke in the house.

276
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,316
These came into the precinct today.

277
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,735
So, if you don't eat them,
they'll probably just go stale.

278
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,863
There you go.

279
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,741
And a knife.

280
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:08,125
- Did you want a coffee?
- No, thank you.

281
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,928
What's that?

282
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,815
"Kevin, I can't say this to you

283
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,235
but I won't just slip it
under the door and run away.

284
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,531
You deserve to look at me
when it is said.

285
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:44,912
You were a good husband, Kevin,
probably a great one.

286
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,790
You were there
when I needed someone the most.

287
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:51,710
You fixed another man's mess,
my mess.

288
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,797
You raised Tom
as if he were your own

289
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,299
and you loved him
even when he wouldn't let you."

290
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,177
What are you doing?

291
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,389
"I need you to know
this isn't your fault.

292
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,182
It's nobody's fault.

293
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:09,978
I was broken.
I tried to fix myself.

294
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,774
I tried for you, and for Tom,
and for Jill,

295
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,360
but I think I'm supposed
to stay broken.

296
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,155
- Maybe we all are."
- What's in that envelope, Laurie?

297
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,450
"I won't insult you, Kevin,

298
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,910
by saying that this is
what's best for you--"

299
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,578
Please stop talking
just for a second.

300
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,541
- "It's not my place to know--"
- What's in the envelope?

301
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,501
"You've always been
the best shoulder to cry on..."

302
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,336
Please stop talking.

303
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,922
- "...but I had to stop crying..."
- What's in the envelope?

304
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,175
- "The world changed..."
- Shut the fuck up!

305
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,032
Are they making you do this?

306
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:12,499
You just-- You don't
talk to me for six months

307
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,002
and then you just walk in here
into our house...

308
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,255
...and then you give me this?

309
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,384
No.

310
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,803
No.

311
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,725
I'm your husband.
We made fucking vows.

312
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,938
You want this, this over?
Then you fucking say it!

313
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,941
You fucking say it!
Not her!

314
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,905
Say it!

315
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,449
"I want this over!"

316
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,287
Fucking say it.
You fucking say it, Laurie!

317
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,765
Honey?

318
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,783
It's for you.

319
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,925
I think you should go.

320
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,188
I didn't know you had a daughter.

321
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,801
You should keep that.

322
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,471
I won't tell.

323
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,503
Excuse me.

324
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:08,634
- Uh, where's maternity?
- Fifth floor.

325
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,594
Thank you.

326
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,086
You know you're in a hospital?

327
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,674
We don't believe in shoes, man.

328
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,222
How'd you end up like this, kid?

329
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,523
I was abandoned by my father.

330
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,125
- Hey.
- Hey.

331
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,086
- You ready to go now?
- Yeah.

332
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,921
Here.

333
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,300
What's that for?

334
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,969
It'll make you invisible

335
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,471
so the Creator can find us.

336
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,520
I knew you'd come back.

337
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:51,194
I promised that I would protect you.

338
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,743
I'll protect it too.

339
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,422
Leave your shoes.

340
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,766
Headed to the dance.

341
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:48,103
I put the 20 bucks under the magnet
if you want to order a pizza.

342
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,688
Thanks.

343
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,109
How much did you hear last night?

344
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,531
"Fucking say it, Laurie."

345
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,122
Why was she here?

346
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,293
Well, it's complicated.

347
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,046
Let me know when it gets simple.

348
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,437
- Go, go, go.
- Hey!

349
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,899
Stop, stop, stop!

350
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,069
Drive! Now!

351
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,090
They found him.

352
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:12,646
- You don't know where Yemen is?
- No, I don't. Show me.

353
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,648
I'll draw a map on your hand.

354
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,526
So if Dubai is here,

355
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:22,530
then Yemen is right here.

356
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,662
- Hi there, buddy.
- Hey.

357
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,872
We didn't wanna wake you.

358
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,959
Tom, this is Tom.

359
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,210
How about you, Tommy...

360
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,260
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

361
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,295
Careful there, Tommy.

362
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:22,340
Some sad idiot paid a fucking fortune
just to bury that thing.

363
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:51,453
Hey, Tom!
They're all in white!

364
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,205
It's just like the dream!

365
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:44,255
And one last thank you
to Chief Garvey

366
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:48,093
and his amazing team
for keeping us all safe tonight.

367
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,179
Come on up here, Kevin.
Say hello.

368
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,898
Thank you, Madame Mayor.

369
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,651
I'm sure we're all set to have
a pretty great time tonight.

370
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,611
I'd only ask that if you have
a few drinks

371
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,988
that you call a cab
on the ride home.

372
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,198
Thank you.

373
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:15,412
And also, I know a lot of you
were worried about this little guy...

374
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,623
...but we found him safe and sound.

375
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,458
And as soon the dance is over,

376
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,627
I am personally gonna
be delivering him

377
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,880
back to the manger,
so that's...

378
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:28,925
...there's that.

379
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,304
- Thank you, Chief Garvey.
- Sure.

380
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,181
We're lucky to have you.

381
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,770
Okay, Mapleton.
How about a slow one?

382
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,372
You all danced out?

383
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,375
I'm just taking a break
before my stunning finale.

384
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,627
- Mm.
- What's up with the baby?

385
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:09,424
- It's not real. It's...
- I figured.

386
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,263
This was my locker.

387
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,432
- You went here?
- I did.

388
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
I don't remember you.

389
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,602
That's because you're much older
than I am.

390
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,238
That was my husband's locker.

391
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,532
Doug.

392
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,827
Ten feet away, it took him
a whole year to notice me.

393
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,290
- Oh.
- "Oh"?

394
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,754
No, I just...

395
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:57,222
I'm sorry about
what happened to him, to you.

396
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,898
I just found out he cheated on me.

397
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,070
I cheated on my wife.

398
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,990
Why?

399
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,835
Is there a good answer
to that question?

400
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,465
I think I just heard it.

401
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,305
- It's Kevin, right?
- Mm-hm.

402
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,725
- Nora?
- Mm-hm.

403
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,605
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

404
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,607
Nice to meet you.

405
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,240
- Have a good night.
- Night.

406
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,877
- Chief, we can't touch them.
- What?

407
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:13,298
They're about five yards back
from school property.

408
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,222
Chief, what are you--

409
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,391
Look like they're on school property
to me.

410
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,394
It's our word against theirs, right?

411
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,491
Hands behind your back.
Let's go, let's go, come on, up.

412
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,660
You know,
I actually started to worry

413
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,413
that you might be a human being
for once and not show up.

414
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,084
Thanks for not letting me down.

415
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,688
Where's everybody else?

416
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,595
Do you want me to come with you?

417
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:37,895
Hey!

418
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,523
Hey, Chief.

419
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:46,654
I heard the baby went missing.
I had a spare.

420
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,366
Oh.

421
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,083
Merry Christmas.
