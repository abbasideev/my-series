00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:33,445
[man]<i> Now, once more return
your attention to the breath.</i>

[soft exhale]

00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:42,365
[soft exhale]

7
00:00:42,925 --> 00:00:45,365
<i>Notice how your breathing continues...</i>

8
00:00:47,365 --> 00:00:49,325
<i>all by itself.</i>

9
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:53,005
[soft exhale]

10
00:00:58,005 --> 00:00:59,725
<i>Your mind may wander.</i>

11
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:03,325
<i>- Simply watch it go.</i>
- [chiming]

12
00:01:06,285 --> 00:01:07,285
<i>Calmly.</i>

13
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:08,885
[chiming]

14
00:01:09,805 --> 00:01:11,245
<i>And without judgment.</i>

15
00:01:17,565 --> 00:01:18,765

[clears throat]

17
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:39,605
- Hiya.
- Hi.

18
00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:44,245
God, that was so fast. I didn't realize
you'd be parked right here.

19
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:47,845
- Yeah, just dropped somebody off.
- Oh, it's my lucky day then.

20
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:50,685
[woman] I'm going to Old Street...
Oh, you've got the details.

21
00:01:57,765 --> 00:01:59,165
So you work in that place?

22
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:01,205
Hmm?

23
00:02:01,645 --> 00:02:03,965
- Sorry, miles away, I didn't catch that.
- [chuckles]

24
00:02:04,045 --> 00:02:06,445
Is that where you work,
where I picked you up?

25
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:08,085
At Smithereen? No.

26
00:02:09,565 --> 00:02:10,565
Just visiting.

27
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:13,325
I mean, I wish I worked there.

28
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:16,965
The facilities they've got in there,
they've got their own spa. It's madness.

29
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:20,405
That's Billy Bauer money for you.

30
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:25,605
Anyway.

31
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:41,925
[door bell chimes]

[sound cuts out]

43
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:24,165
[woman] My daughter's name
was Kristin

44
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:25,885
Krissie.

45
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:29,445
Twenty years old. She was at university.

46
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:35,205
She killed herself, took her own life,
whatever you wanna call it,

47
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:36,805
18 months ago now.

48
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:40,885
And it was out of the blue.

49
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:44,725
One of her flatmates called me.

50
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:49,085
They'd found her in the bathroom.

51
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:54,285
And I'm furious with her!

52
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:58,565
I'm so fucking angry with her
for not telling me.

53
00:03:58,645 --> 00:04:00,765
I thought I knew, I...

54
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:04,525
[sobs softly] I didn't know.

55
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,725
Last time I spoke, she was happy...

56
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:11,165
and just like that, she ended everything.

57
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:12,285
[sniffs]

58
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:14,325
And I don't know why she did it.

59
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:16,965
I've asked myself why a million times.

60
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:21,445
Was it over some boy or her course
or the state of the world or me?

61
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:22,845
Was it something I did?

62
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:29,285
Round and round in my head
but there's no answer, there's nothing.

63
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:33,845
She's not here to say, so...

64
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:37,925
it's never gonna stop, this...

65
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:41,125
needing to know.

66
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:43,245
It's never gonna stop.

67
00:04:52,845 --> 00:04:54,405
[vending machine clattering]

68
00:04:57,285 --> 00:04:59,045
Talk about nerve-racking. [chuckles]

69
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:01,525
That was my first time speaking.

70
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:04,085
I mean, in front of everyone. Tough crowd.

71
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:05,685
Oh, you did really well.

72
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:07,045
- Really?
- Yeah.

73
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,965
First time, though, shit scary, isn't it?

74
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:11,805
Well, to be honest, I don't know.

75
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:13,085
Have you...

76
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:16,485
You haven't spoken while I've been here.
I mean, is it...

77
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:18,245
I just haven't found the right moment yet.

78
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:20,445
Waiting for the right moment.

79
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:27,125
- Anyway.
- Hey, um, do you fancy a drink?

80
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:30,085
Oh, I've got a bit of a long day tomorrow.

81
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:32,485
Come on. Might die tomorrow.

82
00:05:32,845 --> 00:05:34,285
[chuckles] Joke.

83
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:41,245
[woman] Oh, God. Oh, my God.

84
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:43,325
[groans]

85
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:48,245
Oh, my God. I needed that.

86
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:53,805
[breathing heavily]

87
00:05:57,765 --> 00:06:00,205
It's okay. It's okay.

88
00:06:01,765 --> 00:06:04,605
- I wanna make you cum, too.
- In a bit maybe.

89
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:09,885
- Just need a bit... bit of a breather.
- It's been ages.

90
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:12,245
Can't even remember the last time.

91
00:06:14,925 --> 00:06:17,005
- Sorry, do you mind if I...?
- No, no, no.

92
00:06:18,405 --> 00:06:20,565
I know these things are undignified.

93
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,725
Went on a date about four months back
with a guy off an app.

94
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:33,485
Halfway through the starter,
I tell him about Kristin.

95
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:35,085
He reacted like I said I'd got cancer.

96
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,765
That's her.

97
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:42,605
Ah.

98
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:45,805
Her flatmate sent that to me.
It was in her room.

99
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:47,285
[phone beeps, vibrates]

100
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,125
Shit. Okay, give me a minute.

101
00:06:52,085 --> 00:06:55,365
I'm trying
to get into Kristin's Persona account.

102
00:06:57,525 --> 00:07:00,245
I try logging in every day.
It gives you three wrong guesses,

103
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:01,845
then locks you out for hours.

104
00:07:01,925 --> 00:07:04,125
Every time I think of a guess,
I write it in here.

105
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:07,325
This week I'm into places
we went on holiday.

106
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:09,525
I'm her mum. You'd think they'd give me

107
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:12,005
the password to my own daughter's account,
but, no.

108
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:15,685
Violates their privacy policy.

109
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:19,245
They'll memorialize it
if you prove you're next of kin.

110
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:22,205
Makes it sort of sepia
with a tribute photo,

111
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:23,605
but that deletes the inbox.

112
00:07:23,685 --> 00:07:25,085
I just want the inbox.

113
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:27,725
I don't know,
see if there's a reason, an answer.

114
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:30,245
I don't know what I want. Okay.

115
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,485
Right.

116
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:00,885
[sighs]

117
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:06,445
Okay.

118
00:08:08,725 --> 00:08:10,245
Well, there's tomorrow.

119
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:39,005
[man]
<i>Notice how your breathing continues...</i>

120
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:42,605

<i>- Calmly and without judgment.</i>
- [phone chimes]

124
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:03,965
I'm on my way now.

125
00:09:10,645 --> 00:09:12,285
[man] Yeah. Uh-huh.

126
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:17,125
My first-class check-in San Francisco
flight's not for another three hours,

127
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:18,485
so there should be time.

128
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:21,565
Yeah, yeah, I'm hopping in the car now.

129
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:25,285
Okay. Okay, bye.

130
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:28,965
Uh, uh, airport, yeah?

131
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:30,165
Terminal Three.

132
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:35,045
- Do you work in that place?
- Smithereen? Yeah.

133
00:10:06,765 --> 00:10:07,845
[phone vibrates]

134
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:12,125
The sat nav's showing an accident
coming up.

135
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:14,805
Do you mind if I follow an alternate route
it's showing me?

136
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:16,845
It's actually quicker
than the normal way.

137
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:19,605
- Uh, yeah, that's fine.
- Might be a bit twisty

138
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,925
but this thing always seems to know
what it's doing.

139
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:23,365
[man] Mm-hmm.

140
00:10:48,845 --> 00:10:49,925
[gravel crunching]

141
00:10:50,005 --> 00:10:52,485
[brakes squeak]

142
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:57,605
[traffic noise]

143
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,325
- Uh...
- [gun cocks]

144
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:06,805
Put this on. Put it on.

145
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:08,565
Put it on!

146
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:14,085
Round your wrists.
Loop it round your wrists.

147
00:11:14,165 --> 00:11:15,965
- Uh, why are you...
- Just shut up and do it.

148
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:20,165
- Come on. Pull it tight.
- I'm trying. I'm trying.

149
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:22,485
Use your teeth. Pull it with your teeth!

150
00:11:24,565 --> 00:11:25,565
- Uh, what...
- Shut up!

151
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:29,525
Nothing's gonna happen to you
if you just do what I say. Okay?

152
00:11:30,885 --> 00:11:33,405
You're okay. Just do what I say.
Stay there.

153
00:11:34,805 --> 00:11:35,805
Fucking...

154
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:47,445
[exhales]

155
00:11:47,525 --> 00:11:48,725
[car beeps]

156
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,045
Is this about money?

157
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,925
I know I work for Smithereen
but that doesn't mean I've got money!

158
00:11:57,045 --> 00:11:58,925
Don't need to... [gasps]

159
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:01,445
What... What are you doing, man?
I'm just an intern.

160
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:03,125
- What are you doing?
- What did you say?

161
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:08,165
- What did you say?
- I'm just an intern.

162
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:15,925
With a suit, the luggage, the... suitcase?
Why are you going to the airport?

163
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:18,445
It's outfits.
Clothes are in there for Vanessa.

164
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:20,221
- Who the fuck is Vanessa?
- Vanessa Lampton.

165
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:21,685
She's an exec at Smithereen.

166
00:12:21,765 --> 00:12:23,725
Her stylist told me
that I need to go to Heathrow.

167
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:25,885
She's got a bunch of outfits
and she's gotta pick one.

168
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:28,285
That's my job, man. I'm just an intern.

169
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:30,245
So why are you dressed like that?
That's a suit.

170
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:32,845
- You're wearing a fucking suit.
- It's my first week.

171
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:42,805
Oh, fuck!

172
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,845
Fuck! Fuck!

173
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:47,645
Okay.

174
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,725
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

175
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:53,485
Modern fucking companies!
Everyone looks so fucking young!

176
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:58,525
How is anybody looking in supposed
to have a sense of the fucking hierarchy?!

177
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:01,885
Jesus Christ! Half of you cunts
coming out of the building

178
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:03,845
are dressed
like fucking gap-year students.

179
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:04,925
I mean, what...?

180
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:07,125
Fuck! Children.

181
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:08,805
The whole Smithereen building

182
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:12,605
is a box full of fucking children
getting their fingers everywhere.

183
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:15,085
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep...
Wiping your shit.

184
00:13:15,165 --> 00:13:18,685
Your fucking app shit up
on everybody's phone.

185
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,245
Everywhere you look,
people are hooked on the things!

186
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:26,085
It's like chain-smoking. Did you make
a lot of cash out of that, did you?

187
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:27,725
And you lot are hooked on them as well.

188
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,365
Every single person that comes out
of that building's going...

189
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:31,845
People don't even look up anymore.

190
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:35,485
The sky could turn fucking purple
and you cunts wouldn't notice for a month.

191
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,445
You didn't look up
and look where that got you,

192
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,965
sitting in the back like that.

193
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:48,485
An intern. Why didn't you dress
like a fucking intern?! Jesus!

194
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:54,925
All right, work with it, work with it.
Work with...

195
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:56,045

00:13:58,285 --> 00:13:59,925
- Stop! Stop!
- Don't kill me.

197

I can't go in there.
I've got claustrophobia, man.

00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:48,565
Okay, okay.

219

- [panting]
- Look at me.

220
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,765
You can sit in the back seat
if you put this on and you don't move.

221
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:55,885
- Okay? Okay?
- I won't, I won't, I won't move.

Yeah.

What are these?

235
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:43,245
They didn't have cheese and onion.

236

Fuck's sake.

237
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,005

- Did you see that?
- See what?

239
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,525
Something in that car.

240
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,845
It looked like someone
with a bag on their head.

241
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:03,925
What?

242
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:05,965

Yeah, look, that one up ahead.
See it? The blue one?

246
00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:33,045
- I can't see anyone in the back.
- I'm sure there was.

247
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:40,885
Oh, fuck.

248

354
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,445
he's gonna shoot you

- Who needs to speak to Billy Bauer?

372

The man does, the gunman.

373
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:44,245
Okay, Jaden,
I don't know what you're talking about.

374
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:47,085
Can you slow down?
I don't understand what...

- Listen carefully. I've got a gun.

And I'm going to shoot him

The police are here.
They're looking at me.

379
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:00,581
I'm stuck here, I've got a fucking gun.
There's not much time.

380
00:25:00,605 --> 00:25:03,181
I didn't want to do it like this
but I need to speak to Bauer now.

381
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:05,485
Okay. Is this a joke?

if this is bullshit.

Okay.

Here comes the hotstepper.

414
00:27:44,685 --> 00:27:46,645
- Get a cordon going.
- Come on, lads.

415
00:27:50,565 --> 00:27:53,765
- Did you get a look at the hostage yet?
- Yeah. Hood's off, he's in the back.

416
00:27:53,845 --> 00:27:55,525
Early twenties, by the looks of him.

417
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:59,365
- This is David Gilkes, negotiator.
- Either of you speak to the suspect?

418
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,085
For like a second when he pulled the gun.

419
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:04,005
- He seem pissed up? On something?
- No, just angry.

420
00:28:09,525 --> 00:28:11,325
Let's cut back on the razzmatazz.

421
00:28:12,845 --> 00:28:15,285
I know it's tense
but we're not risking a shit storm

422
00:28:15,365 --> 00:28:18,365
like the whole Stretton thing
with poor old Mr. Starter Pistol.

423
00:28:18,525 --> 00:28:20,301
- Ma'am, I...
- Yes, I know but he was unarmed

424
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:22,925
and it was less than a month ago.
Memories aren't that short yet.

425
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:24,605
So no critical shot

426
00:28:24,685 --> 00:28:26,525
unless there's absolutely no choice.

427
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:27,925
- Okay?
- Ma'am.

428
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:32,005
- Your lace is undone.
- Ma'am, they've ID'd the car.

429
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,085
It's registered
to an Eleanor Kathleen Gillhaney,

- Yeah.

432
00:28:40,605 --> 00:28:43,685
- I know Ewelme.
- Okay, you two go and give it a knock.

433
00:28:43,965 --> 00:28:45,565
- See if she's okay.
- Yes, ma'am.

434
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:48,965
Ma'am,
I'm gonna get these cars out of the way.

If this thing ends in a shoot-out,

440
00:29:08,565 --> 00:29:10,645
he should at least be aware
of the situation.

441
00:29:10,725 --> 00:29:12,805
- Got a hit.
- He could start making other demands.

442
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:15,885
- One moment, Don. What is it?
- Okay, the cell he's calling from,

443
00:29:15,965 --> 00:29:17,805
I ran it through everything
and got a match.

444
00:29:17,885 --> 00:29:21,165
It's registered as a two-step
verification number on this account.

445
00:29:24,165 --> 00:29:26,845
Pull out whatever we can get on this guy.
He's still on hold, right?

- Yeah. They contacted the Met

to say one of their interns
is being held at gunpoint.

Shit.

465
00:30:30,725 --> 00:30:33,565
He'd been sent on an errand.
They booked a cab through the Hitcher app.

466
00:30:33,645 --> 00:30:36,405
He's not in a cab now. Call Hitcher,
get what we can on the driver.

- We got the number that sent that photo?
- Yep.

Run the call data through intel.
What did he say to them?

469
00:30:40,765 --> 00:30:42,821
- Did he give a name?
- He wouldn't tell them anything

470
00:30:42,845 --> 00:30:46,165
but he did say he needs to speak
to Billy Bauer on the phone.

so now while he's hearing that,

Probably extortion, whether it's targeted
at your company is something we don't...

if he'd ever expressed hostile sentiments
towards Smithereen as an entity

591
00:36:48,245 --> 00:36:50,045
but nothing shows up on his social.

592

In fact, there's been nothing there at all
for some time.

- Right.
<i>- So the cab that picked Jaden up</i>

- Cut him off now!
- Bill, don't...

842
00:51:46,445 --> 00:51:47,445
[phone beeps]

843
00:51:47,525 --> 00:51:49,085
[dial tone drones]

844
00:51:49,165 --> 00:51:50,725
All right, Pen, give me his number.

845
00:51:51,885 --> 00:51:53,365
- Bill.
<i>- We got his number?</i>

846
00:51:53,445 --> 00:51:54,965
<i>What's his name? Uh...</i>

847
00:51:55,285 --> 00:51:57,365
<i>Christopher Gillhaney?
Give me his number.</i>

848
00:51:57,445 --> 00:51:58,845
Bill, I'm not gonna give you that.

849
00:52:00,445 --> 00:52:03,845
Did everyone catch the same disease today?
I didn't ask you.

850
00:52:03,925 --> 00:52:06,205
<i>You cannot expose yourself to that.</i>

851
00:52:06,605 --> 00:52:08,525
Uh... My laptop in there?

852
00:52:08,605 --> 00:52:09,645
<i>- Bill?</i>
- Yeah.

853
00:52:09,725 --> 00:52:11,405
- And a sat link?
- Yes.

854
00:52:12,365 --> 00:52:13,485
Fuck it. I'll get it myself.

855
00:52:13,525 --> 00:52:14,765
<i>- Bill.</i>
- Peace.

856
00:52:14,845 --> 00:52:15,845
Bill.

857
00:52:32,085 --> 00:52:34,445
Uh, what did Penelope say?
Can you make a note for me?

858
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:37,165
Christopher Michael Gillhaney.

859
00:52:40,645 --> 00:52:43,445
- Christopher Michael Gillhaney.
- UK,

860
00:52:44,085 --> 00:52:46,885
user since '08,
didn't log on for 18 months.

861
00:52:46,965 --> 00:52:47,965
Uh-huh.

862
00:52:50,365 --> 00:52:51,645
Sorry, what's your name?

863
00:52:52,485 --> 00:52:53,405
Tipi.

864
00:52:53,485 --> 00:52:54,925
Hi, I'm Billy.

865
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:57,365
Oh. [chuckles softly]

866
00:52:57,445 --> 00:53:00,965
Tipi, really the only good thing
about my position

867
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:03,085
is every once in a while
I get to invoke...

868
00:53:04,245 --> 00:53:05,245
God-mode.

869
00:53:06,885 --> 00:53:08,725
[helicopter overhead]

870
00:53:18,645 --> 00:53:20,405
[phone rings, vibrates]

871
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:32,045
[Billy]<i> Christopher? Is that Christopher?
Hello?</i>

872
00:53:32,885 --> 00:53:33,885
Yeah, I'm here.

873
00:53:35,085 --> 00:53:36,085
It's me.

874
00:53:38,685 --> 00:53:39,685
<i>Hi.</i>

875
00:53:40,285 --> 00:53:41,565
<i>I'm Billy Bauer.</i>

876
00:53:43,565 --> 00:53:46,805
<i>- You wanted to talk to me?</i>
- I did. I did, yeah. I do.

877
00:53:48,165 --> 00:53:51,125
Okay, well, uh... you got me on the line.

878
00:53:52,365 --> 00:53:57,125
Tell you what, why don't you let
our guy Jaden there go and, uh...

879
00:53:58,005 --> 00:53:59,845
<i>you and I can just, you know, chat?</i>

880
00:53:59,925 --> 00:54:02,805
<i>We can talk about...
whatever it is you want.</i>

881
00:54:02,965 --> 00:54:05,701
- If I let him go, you'll hang up.
- I'm not gonna hang up, Christopher.

882
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:08,085
<i>- I want you to listen to me!</i>
- I'm listening.

883
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:11,285
Let's just not... blow up, okay?

884
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:14,565
Let's just, you know, be calm

885
00:54:15,405 --> 00:54:18,245
<i>and you'll just kind of tell me
what it is that you want.</i>

886
00:54:18,325 --> 00:54:20,685
I just told you.
I want you to listen to me.

887
00:54:20,765 --> 00:54:23,885
<i>- Just fucking listen to me.</i>
- I'm listening.

888
00:54:29,485 --> 00:54:30,685
There's no one else here.

889
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,485
Okay, Chris? It's just... it's you and me.

890
00:54:38,565 --> 00:54:39,645
<i>You have my attention.</i>

891
00:54:45,525 --> 00:54:47,085
- Chris?
<i>- Yeah, I'm just...</i>

892
00:54:48,045 --> 00:54:50,285
<i>I'm just...
it's hard to get my thoughts in order.</i>

893
00:54:50,365 --> 00:54:52,405
I've rehearsed this though, and I just...

894
00:54:52,485 --> 00:54:54,325
<i>That's okay. Take your time, man. Just...</i>

895
00:54:55,965 --> 00:54:57,165
<i>Take your time.</i>

896
00:54:58,085 --> 00:54:59,125
You run Smithereen.

897
00:54:59,605 --> 00:55:00,765
Uh-huh.

898
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:02,365
Since 2008.

899
00:55:03,005 --> 00:55:04,965
<i>I used to use Smithereen all the time.</i>

900
00:55:06,325 --> 00:55:08,565
- Okay.
<i>- I mean, constantly.</i>

901
00:55:09,045 --> 00:55:11,325
<i>Like, my phone was glued to my hand.</i>

902
00:55:12,765 --> 00:55:14,605
I was the whole cliché, you know,

903
00:55:14,965 --> 00:55:17,805
first thing I saw in the morning,
last thing I saw at night.

904
00:55:22,205 --> 00:55:23,285
Tamsin was...

905
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:26,605
[sobbing softly]

906
00:55:28,285 --> 00:55:30,285
<i>Chris? I'm here.</i>

907
00:55:31,845 --> 00:55:34,645
Tamsin was the same. She was my fiancée.

908
00:55:39,165 --> 00:55:40,365
Three years ago...

909
00:55:42,725 --> 00:55:44,485
I was driving home with her.

910
00:55:44,805 --> 00:55:46,245
We'd been visiting my mum.

911
00:55:47,165 --> 00:55:50,045
My mum was sick
and we'd been visiting my mum

912
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:53,165
and I was driving Tamsin back to our flat.

913
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:56,485
She was asleep.

914
00:56:02,205 --> 00:56:04,285
<i>She was tired
and I'm just driving her home.</i>

915
00:56:06,165 --> 00:56:07,885
<i>And it was boring.</i>

916
00:56:10,365 --> 00:56:11,685
<i>I got bored.</i>

917
00:56:13,005 --> 00:56:16,005
<i>I got bored every ten seconds back then,
I think,</i>

918
00:56:16,085 --> 00:56:19,645
<i>and I'm on this A road.</i>

919
00:56:21,085 --> 00:56:23,245
<i>- It was very quiet, straight...</i>
- [phone vibrates]

920
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:26,205
<i>...and my phone lights up and I check it.</i>

921
00:56:28,405 --> 00:56:30,045
<i>I just glanced at it, you know.</i>

922
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:35,165
There's this little notification thing
saying someone liked a comment

923
00:56:35,245 --> 00:56:37,685
that I made about some photo of theirs.

924
00:56:38,805 --> 00:56:40,685
I just glanced at it, you know.

925
00:56:45,565 --> 00:56:47,005
That's all the time it took.

926
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:50,885
[crash, glass shattering]

927
00:56:52,445 --> 00:56:55,005
[metal groans, tires screech]

928
00:57:12,085 --> 00:57:13,445
It took her two months to die.

929
00:57:15,245 --> 00:57:17,725
I was at her bedside. It was no use.

930
00:57:19,565 --> 00:57:21,285
The man in the other car died, too.

931
00:57:21,365 --> 00:57:23,285
[Chris sobs]

932
00:57:23,365 --> 00:57:27,045
<i>He was drunk. He got the blame.
They said it was him.</i>

933
00:57:28,005 --> 00:57:30,285
Everyone felt sorry for me. Mr. Tragic.

934
00:57:31,565 --> 00:57:33,005
Even her parents.

935
00:57:36,965 --> 00:57:39,565
At her funeral, you know,
her mum was comforting me.

936
00:57:40,245 --> 00:57:41,605
Her fucking mum.

937
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:44,485
What could I say to her?

938
00:57:44,685 --> 00:57:47,765
Nobody wants to hear
that their daughter's dead

939
00:57:47,845 --> 00:57:50,445
because I was looking at me fucking phone.

940
00:57:52,205 --> 00:57:55,885
<i>Afterwards, everyone tried to get me
to go to grief counseling.</i>

941
00:57:55,965 --> 00:57:57,525
- [whispers] It's Pen.
<i>- Talk about it.</i>

942
00:57:57,605 --> 00:57:59,365
<i>Just say... say how you feel.</i>

943
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:03,565
<i>And I'm thinking...</i>

944
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:07,045
<i>I can't say a fucking thing.</i>

945
00:58:07,925 --> 00:58:10,965
Because how I feel
is that I fucking killed her.

946
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:17,285
I killed her.

947
00:58:21,685 --> 00:58:22,965
[sobs] Me.

948
00:58:25,045 --> 00:58:28,525
I killed her over a fucking... dog photo.

949
00:58:31,125 --> 00:58:32,565
I killed her over that.

950
00:58:40,565 --> 00:58:41,605
I hear you.

951
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:45,125
What?

952
00:58:45,365 --> 00:58:48,445
<i>I said... "I hear you."</i>

953
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:50,565
Of course you fucking hear me.

954
00:58:53,245 --> 00:58:54,805
You sound like you're in a lot of pain.

955
00:58:54,845 --> 00:58:58,405
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!
Speak like a fucking human being!

956
00:58:59,045 --> 00:59:00,845
You said you hear me so fucking hear me.

957
00:59:00,925 --> 00:59:03,805
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.
They gave me bullshit advice.

958
00:59:03,885 --> 00:59:06,005
- Fucking talking points.
<i>- Talking points.</i>

959
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:07,405
<i>- Fucking hell.</i>
- I know.

960
00:59:08,685 --> 00:59:09,965
Fuck! I'm...

961
00:59:19,965 --> 00:59:21,325
I don't know what to say to you.

962
00:59:22,965 --> 00:59:23,965
Okay?

963
00:59:25,325 --> 00:59:26,525
That's the truth.

964
00:59:28,285 --> 00:59:30,965
I don't know what to say.
I don't know what you want me to say.

965
00:59:31,885 --> 00:59:33,205
I know it was me.

966
00:59:35,485 --> 00:59:37,645
It was me. I was driving. It was my fault.

967
00:59:38,845 --> 00:59:41,645
<i>I never told anyone before
because what good would that do,</i>

968
00:59:41,725 --> 00:59:46,765
or I could write it all down
and leave a... a note, shoot myself,

969
00:59:46,845 --> 00:59:48,445
but what good would that do?

970
00:59:49,845 --> 00:59:51,525
But I thought I could tell you.

971
00:59:52,445 --> 00:59:53,885
If I could get you to listen.

972
00:59:55,565 --> 00:59:57,245
<i>It was your thing, you built it.</i>

973
00:59:58,765 --> 01:00:01,485
I heard that that you make these things
that way.

974
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:03,765
Addictive.

975
01:00:04,445 --> 01:00:07,445
<i>So that you can't take your eyes
off them.</i>

976
01:00:10,445 --> 01:00:11,605
Well, job done.

977
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,485
Bit of user feedback for you there.

978
01:00:17,565 --> 01:00:20,205
Maybe factor that into your next update.
[sniffs]

979
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:24,565
I'm so sorry about your girl.

980
01:00:25,725 --> 01:00:27,245
Truly. I'm, uh...

981
01:00:31,925 --> 01:00:33,685
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

982
01:00:35,085 --> 01:00:36,605
Our whole platform, I swear to God.

983
01:00:36,685 --> 01:00:40,965
It was... like, it was one thing
when I started it

984
01:00:41,045 --> 01:00:43,445
and then it just... I don't know,

985
01:00:43,525 --> 01:00:46,925
it just became
this whole other fucking thing.

986
01:00:48,485 --> 01:00:50,965
<i>I mean, it got there by degrees,
you know, they said...</i>

987
01:00:52,085 --> 01:00:55,085
<i>"Bill, you gotta keep optimizing,
you gotta keep people engaged."</i>

988
01:00:55,165 --> 01:00:57,805
Until it was more like a crack pipe.

989
01:00:57,885 --> 01:01:01,045
It was like
some kind of fucking Vegas casino where...

990
01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:03,685
And we'd sealed off all the fucking doors.

991
01:01:03,765 --> 01:01:07,405
They've got a department... All they do
is tweak it like that on purpose.

992
01:01:07,485 --> 01:01:10,525
They've got dopamine targets
and there's nothing I can do to stop it.

993
01:01:10,605 --> 01:01:13,805
I started it. There's nothing I can do
to fucking stop it.

994
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:18,045
I'm like some kind of...
fucking bullshit front-man now.

995
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:25,725
I swear to God, I've been on this retreat,
supposed to be for ten days...

996
01:01:25,805 --> 01:01:27,325
After, like, day two,

997
01:01:27,405 --> 01:01:29,085
<i>- I decided, fuck it.</i>
- Hey.

998
01:01:29,165 --> 01:01:31,341
<i>- I quit Smithereen. That's it, I'm out.</i>
- Hey. Shut up!

999
01:01:31,365 --> 01:01:32,805
- No way I'm...
<i>- Shut up.</i>

1000
01:01:32,885 --> 01:01:34,685
<i>I don't give a fuck what you do now.</i>

1001
01:01:34,765 --> 01:01:38,965
Beat yourself up or fucking run
a victory lap, I don't care.

1002
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:43,885
I just wanted to say my piece.

1003
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:49,805
<i>I'm gonna go now.</i>

1004
01:01:50,365 --> 01:01:51,445
Chris...

1005
01:01:54,365 --> 01:01:55,645
you gonna let our guy go?

1006
01:01:55,725 --> 01:01:58,085
- Of course I am.
<i>- Oh, thank God.</i>

1007
01:01:59,125 --> 01:02:01,885
I'm going to. I always was, all along.

1008
01:02:04,565 --> 01:02:05,805
And now I'm out of here.

1009
01:02:07,645 --> 01:02:09,925
<i>Wait, Chris, um, out of here</i>

1010
01:02:10,045 --> 01:02:12,205

I can't stay here,
not after what I did to her.

1015

1022
01:02:41,805 --> 01:02:45,045
There's gotta be something that I can do,
even if it's something small.

1023
01:02:46,445 --> 01:02:49,565
There's gotta be one small thing
that I can do for you.

You have?

1035

He's spoken to him.

1036

I'm gonna let you go now, Jaden. Okay?

Thanks.

You can get up.

Careful, careful.
No sudden movements now.

1040

We don't wanna spook them, okay?

1041

Hold out your wrists.

1042
01:04:24,765 --> 01:04:25,845
He's cutting him free.

1043
01:04:39,205 --> 01:04:41,245
I'm sorry
for putting you through all of this.

1044

Don't kill yourself, man.

1047
01:05:17,765 --> 01:05:22,205
Seriously, my uncle killed hisself
and it fucked my whole family up.

1048
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:25,205
My mum's still a mess.
I'll go out there right now

1049
01:05:25,285 --> 01:05:28,405
and then I'll tell all of them,
I'll tell them that you didn't hurt me.

1050
01:05:28,485 --> 01:05:30,845
That's very good of you.
That's very kind of you.

1051
01:05:31,405 --> 01:05:33,485
But I don't wanna be here anymore.

1052
01:05:38,965 --> 01:05:40,725
I won't do it
until you're away from the car.

1053
01:05:40,765 --> 01:05:43,965
