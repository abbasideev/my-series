00:27:23,165 --> 00:27:25,565
- Jack threw Ashley Too away.
- It was an intervention.

339
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:27,365
That thing was poison.

340
00:27:32,325 --> 00:27:33,725
You're gonna buy her a new one.

341
00:27:33,805 --> 00:27:36,325
Ashley was filling her head with crap.

342
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,925
She's the only person
who is actually nice to me.

343
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:40,565
- She's not a person.
- She's my friend.

344
00:27:40,645 --> 00:27:42,485
- Merchandise.
- Girls, calm down please.

345
00:27:42,605 --> 00:27:44,165
- [Rachel] You're jealous.
- Of a doll?

346
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,685
She's not a doll
and she knows me better than you do.

347
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,845
- I'm your sister.
- You hardly even talk to me.

348
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:50,685
- [Jack] Bullshit.
- Ever since Mom died.

349
00:27:50,765 --> 00:27:52,005
You shut up.

350
00:27:52,325 --> 00:27:54,605
It's true, ever since she died,
all you do is mope around

351
00:27:54,685 --> 00:27:57,125
with that stupid guitar,
which you're probably no good at

352
00:27:57,205 --> 00:27:59,325
'cause you're too scared
to play in front of anyone.

353
00:28:00,325 --> 00:28:03,605
Yeah, well, at least I'm not
some cookie-cutter cutesy doodle,

354
00:28:03,685 --> 00:28:06,005
all because a dolly told me to do it.

355
00:28:06,805 --> 00:28:09,765
[imitates Ashley Too]
Hi, I'm Ashley Too, I'm your only friend.

356
00:28:09,845 --> 00:28:11,685
Kiss my feet, kiss my ass!

357
00:28:11,845 --> 00:28:14,085
- I hate you.
- I hate you, too.

358

[rock music plays on headphones]

359
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:46,005
Gave the kitchen the night off.

360
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,965
I thought we could have take out,
like the old days.

361
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:52,365
Sure.

362
00:28:56,165 --> 00:28:57,725
[Catherine] It's La Mamas.

363
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:04,405
I'll hit the gym extra hard tomorrow.

364
00:29:04,885 --> 00:29:07,285
No,
it's good to see you enjoying your food.

365
00:29:12,285 --> 00:29:13,845
I look after you, don't I?

366
00:29:14,885 --> 00:29:15,885
Hm.

367
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:20,045
- You're my manager, so.
- But you'd tell me if anything was wrong?

368
00:29:21,205 --> 00:29:23,125
I've been telling you
that something is wrong...

369
00:29:25,685 --> 00:29:26,765
for a while.

370
00:29:29,405 --> 00:29:33,085
[sighs] It's getting so hard
just to keep doing this.

371
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:37,165
- I really wanna do...
- You wanna change your material, I know.

372
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:39,245
I hear you.

373
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:41,485
I do.

374
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:45,925
I'm sorry, I know how you feel.

375
00:29:47,405 --> 00:29:50,005
I know what I'm like, Ashley, I know.

376
00:29:50,805 --> 00:29:55,045
You feel like I... don't listen,

377
00:29:56,245 --> 00:29:59,525
like I have too much control
over your image, your look,

378
00:30:00,605 --> 00:30:01,645
your persona.

379
00:30:02,645 --> 00:30:03,645
Yeah.

380
00:30:05,485 --> 00:30:07,245
You don't trust Dr. Munk.

381
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:09,445
You don't trust me.

382
00:30:10,285 --> 00:30:11,565
No, it's...

383
00:30:12,285 --> 00:30:13,485
You feel trapped here.

384
00:30:16,845 --> 00:30:18,125
You feel...

385
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:23,925
desperate to break away.

386
00:30:24,885 --> 00:30:26,005
Where did you get that?

387
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:29,125
And, oh, you think you know how.

388
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:34,325
What was the plan? OD? Make me look bad?

389
00:30:35,445 --> 00:30:36,925
Do you know me at all?

390
00:30:37,845 --> 00:30:41,685
Catherine, that's evidence against you,
against Munk.

391
00:30:41,765 --> 00:30:44,125
All of it. I know everything.

392
00:30:44,565 --> 00:30:46,285
I know precisely what you know.

393
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:48,805
There is a wealth of information
on this thing.

394
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:51,405
You do seem preoccupied with contract law.

395
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:53,965
You know,
I could have saved you some clicks.

396
00:30:54,045 --> 00:30:56,805
Your contract's watertight,
it doesn't expire until you turn 25.

397
00:30:56,885 --> 00:30:59,845
Not anymore, not now that you broke laws,
Catherine.

398
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,525
The illegal meds, that puts you in breach,

399
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:04,405
which means that I get an instant break.

400
00:31:06,685 --> 00:31:09,725
- You eat the rest, I'm fucking sick.
- Sit down, you little ingrate.

401
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:12,685
What the fuck did you just call me?

402
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:14,805
Do you know how old I was
when your parents died?

403
00:31:15,845 --> 00:31:17,205
22 years old.

404
00:31:18,925 --> 00:31:20,925
Twenty-two, younger than you,
but I took you in.

405
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:23,045
- It's my fucking fault.
- It's not your fault.

406
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:26,525
But you never once asked me
what that was like for me.

407
00:31:27,405 --> 00:31:29,085
Do you have any idea
what I had to give up?

408
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:31,685
Do you have any conception of that at all?
Did you ever wonder...

409
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,845
Do you ever look around the fucking house

410
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,445
and see where we fucking live
because it means I've worked hard.

411
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:37,605
Oh, this is because of you?

412
00:31:38,045 --> 00:31:39,645
- Where we live is because of you?
- Yes.

413
00:31:39,725 --> 00:31:42,645
And while you sang your little song
and you danced your little dance...

414
00:31:42,725 --> 00:31:43,925
Fuck, Catherine.

415
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:45,885
Who stood, making sure
the lights stay on you?

416
00:31:45,965 --> 00:31:48,445
You can go fuck yourself
a thousand fucking times, Catherine,

417
00:31:48,525 --> 00:31:50,765
I fucking hate you. I fucking hate you.

418
00:31:50,845 --> 00:31:52,365
- Sit down.
- No.

419
00:31:52,445 --> 00:31:54,565
Because I don't have to listen to you
anymore.

420
00:31:54,645 --> 00:31:56,125
But you will sit down.

421
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,525
No, I won't.

422
00:31:57,605 --> 00:31:58,885
Yes, you will.

423
00:32:10,645 --> 00:32:13,005
Do you know what would happen
if you did OD on these things?

424
00:32:13,445 --> 00:32:15,845
I checked with Dr. Munk.
You wouldn't die,

425
00:32:15,925 --> 00:32:18,645
you'd just wind up
in a kind of chemical coma.

426
00:32:20,165 --> 00:32:21,565
At least that's the theory.

427
00:32:25,565 --> 00:32:27,965
I powdered your pill stash
and put it in your food.

428

669
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:18,085
<i>Sure, I get it,
you guys got something better to do.</i>

670
00:46:18,925 --> 00:46:21,685
<i>Well, OK, don't sweat it,
I'll just go on my own, I'm fine.</i>

671
00:46:21,765 --> 00:46:24,525
- Oh! [gasps]
- [Ashley Too groans]

672
00:46:25,045 --> 00:46:28,085
<i>Stupid stumpy arms.</i>

673
00:46:29,205 --> 00:46:30,205
<i>- Get off me!</i>
- Sorry.

674
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,525
<i>If you're not helping me,
get off of me, seriously.</i>

675
00:46:32,605 --> 00:46:35,405
[grunts]

676
00:46:35,485 --> 00:46:37,685
[sighs]

677
00:46:38,205 --> 00:46:40,765
<i>It's alright for you two able-bodied
assholes sitting around.</i>

678
00:46:41,325 --> 00:46:44,605
<i>Fans are always the same.
"Oh, we love you so much,"</i>

679
00:46:44,685 --> 00:46:47,725
<i>until you actually want them
to do anything for you.</i>

680
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,805
<i>Well, forget it,
I'm gonna do it on my own.</i>

681
00:46:52,245 --> 00:46:54,085
<i>Could you open the door for me please?</i>

682
00:46:56,765 --> 00:46:58,045
We're not helping her.

683
00:47:00,365 --> 00:47:01,685
We are not.

684
00:47:06,765 --> 00:47:10,445
[Ashley Too clears throat] <i>Guys.
Come on, guys, I can't see.</i>

685
00:47:10,525 --> 00:47:12,725
<i>Put me up on the dash,
I can show you the way.</i>

686
00:47:16,405 --> 00:47:19,325
Don't scratch the cup holder.
Dad will flip if he knows we took his van.

687
00:47:19,405 --> 00:47:21,165
I'm not scratching the cup holder.

688
00:47:22,165 --> 00:47:23,565
[horn honks]

689
00:47:23,645 --> 00:47:24,565
[tires screech]

690
00:47:24,645 --> 00:47:26,525
Jack! [whimpers]

691
00:47:28,725 --> 00:47:30,085
<i>Relax, your cup holder's fine.</i>

692
00:47:30,165 --> 00:47:32,085
- Shut up.
<i>- Can you drive this thing?</i>

693
00:47:32,685 --> 00:47:34,845
- I think so.
<i>- You think so?</i>

694
00:47:34,925 --> 00:47:37,245
Hey, I can do anything
if I just believe in myself.

695
00:47:37,325 --> 00:47:39,525
<i>I wanna believe that
we'll arrive in one fucking piece.</i>

696
00:47:39,605 --> 00:47:40,885
Ashley, go to sleep.

697
00:47:40,965 --> 00:47:42,805
<i>Yeah, that's not gonna work anymore, OK?</i>

698
00:47:43,325 --> 00:47:44,325
Shit.

699
00:47:47,845 --> 00:47:51,485
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for joining us today

700
00:47:51,565 --> 00:47:56,565
as we introduce you to a brand-new,
yet strangely familiar, superstar.

701
00:48:03,685 --> 00:48:05,165
It's a fucking sign-up.

702
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:17,605
[sighs] <i>OK, we're here.</i>

703
00:48:17,685 --> 00:48:19,045
[Rachel] So now what?

704
00:48:19,645 --> 00:48:23,485
- I guess we just throw her over the gate.
<i>- Are you nuts? How do I get in the door?</i>

705
00:48:30,845 --> 00:48:33,565
No, the deal was that we drive you here,
and we've done that.

706
00:48:33,645 --> 00:48:36,005
<i>I need to get inside to get that evidence.</i>

707
00:48:36,085 --> 00:48:38,846
- [Jack] We're not driving in there...
- We have brought her this far.

708
00:48:38,885 --> 00:48:40,565
- No.
<i>- Hold up, that's my aunt's car.</i>

709
00:48:45,285 --> 00:48:46,365
Oh, the gates are open.

710
00:48:46,445 --> 00:48:48,285
- Jack, Jack, let's go, come on.
- No, no.

711
00:48:48,365 --> 00:48:49,885
<i>Quick, quick, they're gonna shut it.</i>

712
00:48:49,965 --> 00:48:52,765
- Come on, let's go.
<i>- Just do it, OK, do it, go.</i>

713
00:48:52,845 --> 00:48:57,005
<i>Do it, do it, do it, go, yes.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.</i>

714
00:48:57,085 --> 00:48:58,725
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Oh, shit, shit.

715
00:48:58,805 --> 00:48:59,805
[both scream]

716
00:49:08,525 --> 00:49:09,525
[Jack] Well, what now?

717
00:49:09,965 --> 00:49:12,085
What's the next phase
of your brilliant plan?

718
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,725
[doorbell rings]

719
00:49:21,045 --> 00:49:23,645
- What the hell do I even say?
- [Ashley Too] <i>Just wing it.</i>

720
00:49:23,725 --> 00:49:26,125
<i>And lose the nose ring,
it makes you look unprofessional.</i>

721
00:49:34,045 --> 00:49:35,605
[Jack] Oh, my God, he's huge.

722
00:49:39,165 --> 00:49:40,165
Goggin's Mouse Service.

723
00:49:40,805 --> 00:49:42,125
How did you get through the gate?

724
00:49:43,005 --> 00:49:44,045
It was open.

725
00:49:44,325 --> 00:49:48,445
Look, I have an appointment for 11:30
to deal with your rodent infestation.

726
00:49:49,485 --> 00:49:50,845
No, you got the wrong place.

727
00:49:51,285 --> 00:49:53,645
It was 10030 Bushwick Drive, right?

728
00:49:53,725 --> 00:49:55,805
Look, we don't have a rodent problem.

729
00:49:55,885 --> 00:49:58,085
The lady of the house said
it was super urgent.

730
00:49:58,485 --> 00:50:01,445
We don't have another appointment
for about three weeks.

731
00:50:01,525 --> 00:50:02,525
[exhales]

732
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:05,965
- Make it quick.
- OK, thanks.

733
00:50:06,805 --> 00:50:10,245
Oh, hey, would it be alright
if my little sister tagged along?

734
00:50:12,245 --> 00:50:13,245
Hi.

735
00:50:14,165 --> 00:50:15,165
Your sister?

736
00:50:16,085 --> 00:50:19,165
Well, well, what do we have here?

737
00:50:19,965 --> 00:50:20,965
A kitchen.

738
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:24,365
Yes, and mice love kitchens.

739
00:50:25,765 --> 00:50:27,245
Have you ever seen <i>Tom and Jerry?</i>

740
00:50:27,645 --> 00:50:31,165
It's a whole lot more accurate
than people would think.

741
00:50:32,445 --> 00:50:36,525
- Excuse me, sir, may I use the bathroom?
- [Bear] I'll take you there.

742
00:50:37,165 --> 00:50:38,845
You can't just walk around.

743
00:50:39,165 --> 00:50:41,925
Actually,
I'm gonna need your help in here, mister.

744
00:50:42,445 --> 00:50:44,325
Bear, they call me Bear.

745
00:50:45,285 --> 00:50:47,245
Well, I'm gonna need your help in here,
Mr. Bear.

746
00:50:48,365 --> 00:50:50,605
- What for?
- Observation.

747
00:50:50,685 --> 00:50:52,085
Uh, I really need to go.

748
00:50:56,605 --> 00:50:59,565
- Down the hall, turn left.
- [Rachel] Thank you.

749
00:51:04,845 --> 00:51:06,205
Excuse me, sir.

750
00:51:06,285 --> 00:51:07,965
Has this bread box been certified?

751
00:51:08,045 --> 00:51:09,365
Certified how?

752
00:51:13,725 --> 00:51:19,565
The state requires them to be certified
because the crumbs, they attract rodents.

753
00:51:19,645 --> 00:51:21,005
I've never heard of that.

754
00:51:22,605 --> 00:51:24,325
Well, they forgot to tell people.

755
00:51:26,565 --> 00:51:29,525
<i>OK, just a few more steps.
We're nearly there.</i>

756
00:51:31,965 --> 00:51:35,365
[monitor beeps]

757
00:51:35,445 --> 00:51:37,045
<i>Oh, God.</i>

758
00:51:39,045 --> 00:51:41,205
- It's really her.
- <i>Oh, yeah, yeah, OK.</i>

759
00:51:41,285 --> 00:51:43,085
<i>Quit fangirling and put me down.</i>

760
00:51:44,965 --> 00:51:46,445
<i>I'm gonna roll over and Bluetooth in.</i>

761
00:51:46,525 --> 00:51:48,125
<i>You gotta keep watch on the stairs, OK?</i>

762
00:52:01,605 --> 00:52:06,365
Yep, you're definitely gonna
wanna take a look down here.

763
00:52:09,965 --> 00:52:10,965
There's, uh...

764
00:52:11,885 --> 00:52:13,845
clear signs of mouse activity.

765
00:52:17,605 --> 00:52:18,845
[Bear] I don't see anything.

766
00:52:20,165 --> 00:52:21,165
[Jack] Mm-hmm.

767
00:52:24,965 --> 00:52:26,165
[Ashley Too] <i>Oh, boy.</i>

768
00:52:28,965 --> 00:52:30,125
[exhales]

769
00:52:49,405 --> 00:52:51,125
[strains]

770
00:52:53,685 --> 00:52:56,045
[prolonged monitor beep]

771
00:53:03,205 --> 00:53:05,445
- What did you do?
- <i>I did what I had to.</i>

772
00:53:11,965 --> 00:53:13,405
[alert sounds]

773
00:53:17,005 --> 00:53:18,445
[Munk] The fuck is that?

774
00:53:20,325 --> 00:53:21,325
[Munk] <i>Bear.</i>

775
00:53:22,685 --> 00:53:24,005
- Yeah?
- [Munk] <i>Check on Ashley.</i>

776
00:53:24,085 --> 00:53:26,805
<i>We've got some kind of power issue,
I'm not sure what it is.</i>

777
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:30,325
OK. I'll check it out.

778
00:53:31,485 --> 00:53:33,565
- Wait.
- What?

779
00:53:35,285 --> 00:53:37,485
- [electrical crackling]
- [thud]

780
00:53:39,005 --> 00:53:40,965
[Jack whimpers]

781
00:53:47,085 --> 00:53:49,485
Dad, please tell me
you turned down the voltage.

782
00:53:52,805 --> 00:53:54,565
[Rachel cries]

783
00:53:56,085 --> 00:53:57,445
You killed her.

784
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:00,885
<i>Rachel, listen, I know me, OK?</i>

785
00:54:00,965 --> 00:54:04,685
<i>And I know I wouldn't wanna exist
even ten minutes in that state.</i>

786
00:54:06,045 --> 00:54:07,685
[Jack] What happened?

787
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:10,045
She killed her.

788
00:54:10,645 --> 00:54:13,325
<i>Look, it's not that big of a deal, OK?</i>

789
00:54:13,405 --> 00:54:16,205
<i>I'm still alive, OK, I count,
I'm still me.</i>

790
00:54:16,285 --> 00:54:18,405
You were never gonna look for evidence,
were you?

791
00:54:18,485 --> 00:54:20,605
You just come in here
and you pull the plug.

792
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:23,165
<i>If I'd told you that,
you wouldn't have helped me.</i>

793
00:54:23,245 --> 00:54:25,445
No, no, we wouldn't have.

794
00:54:27,085 --> 00:54:28,085
Rachel.

795
00:54:28,725 --> 00:54:30,925
- We gotta go.
- I'm so sorry.

796
00:54:34,845 --> 00:54:36,005
[gasps]

797
00:54:36,885 --> 00:54:37,765
Oh, shit.

798
00:54:37,845 --> 00:54:39,125
- [whirring]
- [Jack] Holy fuck.

799
00:54:39,205 --> 00:54:41,205
[Ashley O grunts]

800
00:54:41,285 --> 00:54:42,765
- [Rachel] Ashley.
- [grunts]

801
00:54:43,725 --> 00:54:47,405
Oh, my gosh. I'm such a huge fan.

802
00:54:51,605 --> 00:54:52,485
[Munk] Bear?

803
00:54:52,565 --> 00:54:54,845
[Jack] Oh, my God.
There's someone coming. Come on!

804
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:56,085
Bear?

805
00:54:57,325 --> 00:54:58,365
Bear?

806
00:54:59,805 --> 00:55:00,805
[shivers]

807
00:55:12,085 --> 00:55:13,405
[unsteady breathing]

808
00:55:13,485 --> 00:55:14,965
[indistinct chatter]

809
00:55:17,445 --> 00:55:19,165
[Catherine] And then it's
"It isn't a dream,

810
00:55:19,205 --> 00:55:22,285
it's reality, but enough from me,"
yadda, yadda, yadda, then it's...

811
00:55:22,765 --> 00:55:23,925
And then it's showtime.

812
00:55:24,005 --> 00:55:25,285
[phone rings]

813
00:55:28,045 --> 00:55:30,365
Munk. [whispers] I got it.

814
00:55:30,565 --> 00:55:31,805
Why are you interrupting me?

815
00:55:31,885 --> 00:55:33,605
- [unsteady breathing]
- [Munk] She's up.

816
00:55:33,685 --> 00:55:36,285
- Who's up?
- [Munk] <i>Sleeping Beauty, she's awake.</i>

817
00:55:37,325 --> 00:55:39,405
[Catherine] <i>What?
What the hell is going on?</i>

818
00:55:39,485 --> 00:55:41,685
[Munk] Looks like the dream box
had a power outage.

819
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:44,605
The good news is
the restraint system works.

820
00:55:44,685 --> 00:55:45,685
No.

821
00:55:46,285 --> 00:55:48,765
We need her alive,
at least until they sign the papers.

822
00:55:50,645 --> 00:55:51,725
Put her back under.

823
00:55:52,285 --> 00:55:53,285
Of course.

824
00:55:53,365 --> 00:55:55,405
[sobs] Please, I'm begging you,

825
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,285
please don't do this to me, please.

826
00:55:57,365 --> 00:55:59,525
[grunts]

827
00:56:04,565 --> 00:56:08,045
- Fuck! [sobs]
- [Munk] Shhh.

828
00:56:08,205 --> 00:56:12,045
- Please, no, no.
- It's OK.

829
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:13,205
Please.

830
00:56:15,165 --> 00:56:16,525
[whimpers]

831
00:56:17,325 --> 00:56:18,525
Leave her alone.

832
00:56:18,605 --> 00:56:20,565
[shouts] Leave her alone. [groans]

833
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:22,125
[Munk grunts]

834
00:56:33,485 --> 00:56:34,325
[groans]

835
00:56:34,405 --> 00:56:35,885
[sobs] Help me.

836
00:56:38,085 --> 00:56:40,325
