How long have you two known each other?

<i>- OK. But...</i>

534
00:43:13,605 --> 00:43:15,205
we don't have to completely cut it off.

535
00:43:15,285 --> 00:43:18,725
What about, like, first Sunday
of each month?

536
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,805
- No.
- Just now and then.

537
00:43:20,885 --> 00:43:23,445
Karl, it has to stop. Clean break.

538
00:43:23,525 --> 00:43:26,485
Come on. This is good. This is good.
You know it is.

539
00:43:26,565 --> 00:43:28,005
Look, I gotta go.

540
00:43:29,165 --> 00:43:31,005
- I'm sorry.
<i>- Danny.</i>

541
00:43:31,885 --> 00:43:34,005
- Goodbye.
<i>- Danny.</i>

542
00:44:13,365 --> 00:44:16,445
[Danny] I gotta get past you, you ready?
Go.

543
00:44:19,045 --> 00:44:20,045
[Danny] All right.

544
00:44:23,805 --> 00:44:24,805
[Danny] You win.

545

[phone chimes]

547
00:44:53,085 --> 00:44:55,005
[Danny] And he is down.

548
00:44:55,085 --> 00:44:58,485
- Macaroo found that shoe again, huh?
- And put it in a tree.

549
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:07,645
Happy birthday.

550
00:45:07,725 --> 00:45:11,325
- Oh!
- Sorry it's not much. I couldn't get out.

551
00:45:11,405 --> 00:45:14,525
- It's exactly what I wanted.
- [laughs]

552
00:45:14,605 --> 00:45:15,645
Thank you.

553
00:45:17,325 --> 00:45:18,445
That smells good.

554
00:45:18,525 --> 00:45:21,685
It's the sort of red-meat caveman food
you like.

555
00:45:21,765 --> 00:45:24,445
- Yeah. That's a hell of a serving size.
- Yeah.

556
00:45:24,525 --> 00:45:25,925
You having your hunger pangs again?

557
00:45:28,245 --> 00:45:30,885
- There's three of us eating tonight.
- I know, that's what I said.

558
00:45:30,925 --> 00:45:33,965
I mean, three adults. I invited Karl over.

559
00:45:35,765 --> 00:45:37,365
Surprise.

560
00:45:39,525 --> 00:45:40,405
Karl?

561
00:45:40,485 --> 00:45:43,685
Yeah, well, last year
you said you hardly got to see him.

562
00:45:43,765 --> 00:45:46,005
You didn't get to speak to him
at that barbecue we had.

563
00:45:46,085 --> 00:45:47,565
So I emailed him last week.

564
00:45:48,965 --> 00:45:50,205
And what did he say?

565
00:45:50,285 --> 00:45:52,405
He said he was looking forward to it.

566
00:45:53,605 --> 00:45:56,405
[doorbell buzzes]

567
00:45:56,485 --> 00:45:57,765

[Theo]<i> Oh, my God,
you remember that crazy dude</i>

569
00:46:08,525 --> 00:46:11,125
<i>that lived downstairs
when we were at Madeley?</i>

570
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:13,965
<i>He used to bang on the ceiling
when we played the music.</i>

571
00:46:14,045 --> 00:46:15,885
He had a point, though,
because we were loud.

572
00:46:15,965 --> 00:46:17,125
[Danny] Mm-hmm.

573
00:46:20,725 --> 00:46:23,125
Baby, you remember the time
that you got that molly

574
00:46:23,565 --> 00:46:26,405
and you insisted that we all take it?

575
00:46:26,485 --> 00:46:28,685
I had to go to work the next day.

576
00:46:28,965 --> 00:46:32,485
- [Karl laughs]
- Lord. We were young, I guess.

577
00:46:33,245 --> 00:46:34,245
Well.

578
00:46:35,885 --> 00:46:39,045
Hennessey and dessert
is as crazy as it gets now.

579
00:46:41,605 --> 00:46:43,965
Speaking of dessert, it's almost ready.

580
00:46:54,925 --> 00:46:56,405
What the fuck are you doing?

581
00:46:57,525 --> 00:47:00,405
- Just eating.
- That's not what I mean, OK?

582
00:47:01,245 --> 00:47:02,285
Why the fuck did you come?

583
00:47:02,365 --> 00:47:04,285
She asked me to come.
What do you want me to say?

584
00:47:04,325 --> 00:47:05,565
- An excuse.
- Such as what?

585
00:47:05,645 --> 00:47:07,285
Such as anything.

586
00:47:09,605 --> 00:47:11,685
What am I? Your ex-wife or something?

587
00:47:11,765 --> 00:47:13,445
Look, it's too strange, OK?

588
00:47:14,445 --> 00:47:16,285
It's just too fucking strange.

589
00:47:24,565 --> 00:47:26,005
I'll tell you what's strange.

590
00:47:32,245 --> 00:47:35,245
Nothing matches it, does it?

591
00:47:37,085 --> 00:47:41,205
I tried replacing it, man. I tried.

592
00:47:42,405 --> 00:47:44,565
I tried fucking
the computer-controlled characters.

593
00:47:44,645 --> 00:47:46,045
- It's bullshit.
- Shut up.

594

It's like a rubber doll.
Not programmed for any sex stuff.

595
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:49,765
They just sort of lie there.

596
00:47:51,885 --> 00:47:53,245
I tried it with real players.

597
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,925
Other folks controlling Lance.

598
00:47:58,045 --> 00:47:59,605
There was this one guy from Holland.

599
00:47:59,685 --> 00:48:03,365
He was kind of halfway OK as long as
I didn't think about this accent.

600
00:48:03,445 --> 00:48:06,205
But it didn't get me.

601
00:48:08,005 --> 00:48:10,845
It didn't get me,
not like when we're in there. You and me.

602
00:48:12,965 --> 00:48:14,125
Stop it.

603
00:48:14,805 --> 00:48:16,285
I tried everything.

604
00:48:18,245 --> 00:48:20,565
I've gone in there as guy players,
girl players,

605
00:48:20,645 --> 00:48:23,045
multi-player gangbangs, you name it.

606
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:26,605
You know, I even fucked Tundra,
the polar bear character.

607
00:48:29,805 --> 00:48:33,805
I fucked a polar bear and I still
couldn't get you out of my mind.

608
00:48:33,885 --> 00:48:34,885
I can't help you.

609
00:48:34,965 --> 00:48:36,365
You want to fuck Roxi again.

610
00:48:36,445 --> 00:48:37,645
- I don't.
- You do.

611
00:48:38,805 --> 00:48:40,885
- Just...
- The best sex of my life.

612
00:48:42,605 --> 00:48:45,285
Best of yours too.
Fucking transcendent. You know it was.

613
00:48:48,245 --> 00:48:49,285
Think about it.

614
00:48:51,445 --> 00:48:55,245
Think about her. Roxi.

615
00:48:56,165 --> 00:49:00,925
Holding her, her warm skin against yours.

616
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:04,045
- Please.
- Her tight wet pussy.

617
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:06,965
- Fuck, man.
- She'll be in there at midnight.

618
00:49:07,765 --> 00:49:10,405
Just come on in one last time.
You know you want to. One last time.

619
00:49:16,005 --> 00:49:17,605

620
00:49:17,685 --> 00:49:18,685
[chuckles]

621
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:23,365
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit, yeah.

622
00:49:23,445 --> 00:49:24,645
That looks good.

623
00:49:27,445 --> 00:49:28,645
Baby, your plate.

624

- Is that your tiramisu?
- Mm-hmm. You know it.

Good to see you.

627

Happy birthday, man.
It was good to see you.

628
00:49:54,045 --> 00:49:55,405
Yeah, you, too.

629

No. No!

- OK.
- We're not gonna fight.

656

We're gonna kiss.

Like... kiss.

659
00:54:10,405 --> 00:54:11,765
It's the only way. We gotta know.

Just fucking kiss me, man.

672
00:55:19,365 --> 00:55:21,885
Nope. Not a damn thing.

No. You got to get that shit
out of your head.
