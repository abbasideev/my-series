"Heaven is a Place on Earth"
by Belinda Carlisle

2
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,912
Belinda Carlisle there with
one of the biggest hits of 1987 so far.

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,638
You gotta love that track!

4
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,354
Coming up next in just a moment
here on San Junipero...

5
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,800
Could you please stop it?

6
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,309
- I just wanna have some fun, OK?
- Kelly, come on.

7
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,118
Kelly.
- I'm still walking, Wes.

8
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,073
We've only got a couple of hours,
you know, so let's use it.

9
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,838
I am using it.

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,911
"C'est La Vie"
by Robbie Nevil

11
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,476
Hey.

12
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,149
You're good at this.

13
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,396
It's, got different endings.

14
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,670
Depending on if you're in one
or two player.

15
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,433
It was kinda the first game to do that.
- Damn it!

16
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,630
Do you wanna play, 
Top Speed?

17
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,434
No.

18
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,914
Sorry.

19
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,234
Thank you.

20
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,996
I just want to get my bearings a bit.

21
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,553
OK.

22
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,113
See you around?

23
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,235
Damn it.

24
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,597
Go along with whatever I say.

25
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,950
Sorry?
- Whatever I say, go along with it.

26
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,156
OK, Wes, you're just pestering now.

27
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,355
Do I have to red light you?
-It's 2 hours, 35.

28
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,038
There's not much time left.
- Wes.

29
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,036
Look...

30
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,191
Last week, we had the most amazing...
- Last week was last week.

31
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,236
I need to talk with
my friend here, OK?

32
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,510
Haven't seen her in a while.

33
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,119
Wes, she's sick.

34
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,876
Like 'six months to live' sick.

35
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,955
Five, actually.

36
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,834
I need to catch up with her.

37
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,271
Private time.

38
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,836
OK.

39
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,630
OK.

40
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,590
Hey, I'm sorry.
- That's OK.

41
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,150
I'll see you around?

42
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,869
Sure.

43
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,078
Sorry for killing you.

44
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,111
The whole 'six months to live' thing?

45
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,673
Sorry, five.

46
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,634
Five was a nice touch.

47
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,516
Kelly.
- Yorkie.

48
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,877
Yurgie?
- Yorkie.

49
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,118
Like the dog breed?

50
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,350
Yeah.

51
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,798
He's not a bad guy.
I feel kinda bad.

52
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,472
Met him at the Quagmire so...
- What's the Quagmire?

53
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,760
If you don't already know
what the Quagmire is

54
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,871
you probably don't wanna know.

55
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,990
No, I...

56
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,150
You want another one?

57
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,637
- No, I...
- Yeah, you do. Come on.

58
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,789
Do I have to tug your leash?

59
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,759
Hey, Blondie.
- I'm Blondie?

60
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,189
You are.
Jack and Coke times two.

61
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,356
- No. Mine was just a Coke.
- Times two.

62
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,756
What are you doing?
- I'm... regarding you.

63
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,749
I feel like I'm being analysed.

64
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,030
Why the glasses?
-Um...

65
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,516
I like them. They totally work on you.
But do you need them?

66
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,272
Yeah, the lenses don't do anything.
- Knew it!

67
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,675
I used to wear them in school

68
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,917
so I guess now they're just kind
of a... comfort thing.

69
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,349
I figured they were kind of
a fashion statement.

70
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,835
Really?
- But then the rest of your outfit is not.

71
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,435
Don't take that wrong.

72
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,793
It's refreshing.
I mean, look around.

73
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,792
People try so hard to look
how they think they should look.

74
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,511
Because they probably saw it
in some movie.

75
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,469
But I like these.

76
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,719
You're authentically you.

77
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,710
Thanks.

78
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,309
Cheers.

79
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,511
You never tasted it before?

80
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,630
No, I...

81
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,840
I just haven't had it in a while.
It's good.

82
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,755
Do you live here?

83
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,516
- No....
- Tourist?

84
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,395
We'll go with tourist.
So you're new here?

85
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,832
First night.
- First night? Well, OK!

86
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,518
"Fake"
by Alexander O'Neal

87
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,113
My God!

88
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,633
We have to dance to this.

89
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,233
With each other?

90
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,920
No, I...
Dance floors aren't my thing.

91
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,678
Let's not limit ourselves.

92
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,396
No, I can't.
- My ass you can't. Come on.

93
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,515
No, I'll look dumb, I...
- Just follow my lead!

94
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,034
Copy me!

95
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,753
You got it.

96
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,189
Guys, guys! Over here! Come on!

97
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,509
Hey!

98
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,918
- Why'd you run away?
- Sorry.

99
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,476
I... I'm...
I said I'm not much of a dancer.

100
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,275
No shit.

101
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,274
Like a frightened horse
on a frozen lake back there.

102
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,434
I'm kidding. Half kidding.

103
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,752
Sorry I pushed you into it.

104
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,189
Saturday night's once a week.
It's, like, no time. I get impatient.

105
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,039
No, no, it's not that.
It's just...

106
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,515
Everyone was looking.
- Looking?

107
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,280
Yeah.
You know, two girls dancing.

108
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,199
OK, one, folks are way less uptight
than they used to be.

109
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,358
And two, this is a party town.
No one's judging.

110
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,631
Face it. If they were staring,
it's because I am bodacious.

111
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,631
You're stupid.
- Thank you!

112
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,593
I've never been on a dance floor.
- Never?

113
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,789
As in the whole time you've
been alive never?

114
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,797
Never.

115
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,397
What are you, like, Amish?

116
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,110
That's one sheltered existence
you got there.

117
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,514
Yeah, well.

118
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,992
As far as my family's concerned,
I can't do anything.

119
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,351
Well, no one knows about even
half the shit I get up to.

120
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,158
With your folks, though,
it's from a place of love, though, right?

121
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,596
They worry.
- They don't worry.

122
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,595
Just the concept of me enjoying myself
would blow their minds.

123
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,353
What would you like to do?

124
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,878
That you've never done?

125
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,791
So many things.

126
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,675
San Junipero is a party town.

127
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,798
All up for grabs.

128
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,638
Midnight's two hours away.

129
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,270
That's not long.

130
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,436
Why waste time sitting here?

131
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,273
I...

132
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,393
- Listen...
- It's OK.

133
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,114
No, I mean...
- Really, it's OK.

134
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,552
No, I'm...
I'm engaged. I have a fiance.

135
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,720
He's called Greg.
- And is Greg here?

136
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,350
No, he's...
- Elsewhere?

137
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,720
Yeah.

138
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,511
Wanna go to bed with me?

139
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,237
We could be back at mine
in, like...

140
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,870
I never did anything like that.

141
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,314
All the more reason.

142
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,638
You're nice.

143
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,040
I can't.
- OK.

144
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,959
I just... I can't.
-I get it.

145
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,917
I have to go.
- In this?

146
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,871
It's been really great to meet you.

147
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,630
Likewise.

148
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,435
OK.

149
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,714
OK...

150
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,200
OK.

151
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,600
Shit.

I'm red lighting you, for real, OK?
- No, don't do that. Just...

172
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,276
Then stop this.
- Can you hear me out? Please? Please.

00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,151

- I don't care.

175

I'm saying there's plenty
of other girls out there for you, Wes.

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,949
The locals?
They're like dead people.

177
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,276
A little lively for dead people.

178
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,879
Look, I don't want some kind
of boring romance, OK?

179
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,514
Like, Jesus,
put us in a retirement home deal.

180
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,313
Well, if you're looking for someone
to fuck, there's options.

181
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,636
Hang out at the Quagmire again.
- It's not just sex.

182
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,671
It was just sex.
- No, we made a connection.

183
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,597
Wes, it was just sex.

184
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,915
No...
- No roots.

185
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,159
We had fun.

186
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,114
I'm sorry.

187
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,196
Enjoy the town, for God's sake.

189
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,434
Hey.
- Hey.

190
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,399
Waiting for someone?

191
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,919
Not really.

192
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,109
I'll get you a drink?

193
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,233
Yeah, sure.

194
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,272
So, yeah,
it was microsurgery, I guess.

195
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,755
You know, both my kneecaps
had kind of just worn down.

196
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,520
You know, I never got this song.
Kind of weird.

197
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,754
Shall we dance?
- Sure.

"Need You"
by INXS

199
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,989
I mean, I guess by the time I'd
put that money into, like, computing...

200
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,592
you know, caught that first wave,
would have been a different story.

201
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,875
Gotta use the bathroom.

202
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,869
OK.

203
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,918
I don't know how to do this.

204
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,109
Do what?

205
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,389
Just help me.

206
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,673
Can you just...

207
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,152
just make this easy for me?

208
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,598
You wanna get in my car?

209
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,909
How long have you been here?
- Sorry?

210
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,669
How long have you been here?
- In San Junipero?

211
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,394
A couple months.
Plan is long enough to enjoy myself.

212
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,191
Guess I'm a tourist, like you.

213
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,515
Yeah.

214
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,233
Hey. You OK?

215
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,710
Yeah.

216
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,917
Stop!

217
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,198
Sorry, but...

218
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,032
Man, your face!

219
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,389
Wow.

220
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,638
You like it?
- It's just so big.

221
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,557
Reminds me of where I grew up.

222
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,113
With your mom?

223
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,158
You have to show me.

224
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,439
OK.
- OK.

225
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,189
You never slept with a woman before?

226
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,032
That's not a critique.

227
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,597
I mean, it was fucking awesome.

228
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,271
No, never with a woman.

229
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,675
Never with anyone.

230
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,193
Not anyone?

231
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,349
What, in town or...?
- No. No one, nowhere.

232
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,074
I guess you deflowered me.
- I deflowered you?

233
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,391
What is this? Merrie England?

234
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,959
Shut up.

235
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,596
You've had relationships though.

236
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,676
Mnh-mnh.

237
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,517
Hello! You got a fiancé.

238
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,200
It's complicated.
- Yeah, I'll say.

239
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,034
When did you know?

240
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,189
That you liked women?
- I like men, too.

241
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,995
Equal rights.

242
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,320
OK.

243
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,672
But when did you know?

244
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,318
Do you always know?

245
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,638
I was married to a guy.

246
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,350
A long time, I was married.

247
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,797
I always knew.

248
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,310
I mean, I'd be attracted
to other girls...

249
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,311
Co-workers, friends,
some waitress who'd serve me.

250
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,194
There were crushes.

251
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,672
God, were there crushes.

252
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,116
Never acted on any of it.

253
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,512
Never did anything.

254
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,518
I was in love with him.

255
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,516
I really was in love with him.

256
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,920
But he chose not to stick around.

257
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,594
So now it's me.

258
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,113
And I am passing through.

259
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,391
And before I leave,
I'll have a good time.

260
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,711
I'm just gonna have a good time.

261
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,953
Time's nearly up.

262
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,918

- Kelly's friend?
- Do you know where to find her?

276
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,872
How would I know that?
- You're her friend.

277
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,680
Was a friend.
- Has she been here?

278
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,910
No.

279

Hey. Try a different time.

282
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,230
Seen her '80, the '90s,
2002 one time.

283
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,593

Wait a minute.

306
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,270
Why are you here?

307
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,515
I was looking for you.
Where did you go?

308
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,278
I like a change of music.

309
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,833
How the hell is this your era?

310
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,110
You hid from me.
- One, I did not.

311
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,436
Two, I owe you zero.
And three...

312
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,830
See point two.

313
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,475
It's not about who owes who.
It's about manners.

314
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,078
You don't know who I am.

315
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,358
You don't know what this means.

316
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,915
This means fun.

317
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,990
Or it should. And this...

318
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,316
This is not fun, OK?

319
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,994
This is not fun.

320
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,754
So you don't feel bad?

321
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,799
Maybe you should feel bad.

322
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,111
Or at least feel something.

323
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,360
Have you seen a girl?
Mid-20s, brown hair, glasses?

324
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,518
Jeez.

As in full-timers?

331
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,471
Eighty. Eighty-five.

332
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,396
I'm sorry.

333
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,993
I'm not gonna jump.
- I know, and I'm sorry, whatever it's...

334
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,475
In the time I've been here,
I said I wouldn't...

335
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,955
I don't know, do feelings.

336
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,678
You freaked me out.

337
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,551
I don't want to like anyone.

338
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,277
So you've been just...
totally fucking inconvenient.

339
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,233
It's that...

340
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,275
I don't know how long there is.

341
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,078
And I can't.
I wasn't prepared for you.

342
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,270
For wanting something...

343
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,839

344
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,713

345
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,829
Next week?

346
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,158
To nice Greg?

347
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,629
Sure you're going through with that?
- I have to.

348
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,036
You have to?

349
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,196
He really is a good guy.

350
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,510
I mean, my family don't approve,
but...

351
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,353
they can't stop us.

352
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,880
I know he pities me.

353
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,516
That pisses me off.

354
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,791
But that's not fair 'cause he's...
- Shh, shh, shh.

355
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,231
You said you don't know
how much time there is.

356
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,400
What does that mean?

357
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,951
They tell me three months.

358
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,679
It's spread basically everywhere.

359
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,119
They've said three months before
six months ago

360
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,878
so, you know, what do they know?

361
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,877
Doesn't even taste of anything.

362
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,999
But so you'll stay here after?
- No.

363
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,077
When I'm done, I am done.

364
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,316
But that's cra... I mean...

365
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,872
Why?
- Richard.

366
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,118
That's...

367
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,351
My husband's name was Richard.

368
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,836
He died just two years ago.

369
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,750
So we had the opportunity
to stay in San Junipero.

370
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,120
Pass over.

371
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,473
Didn't take it.

372
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,637
Didn't want to take it.
- Why wouldn't anyone take it?

373
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,638
He had his viewpoint.

374
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,919
There were things he believed
and things he didn't believe in

375
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,429
and this place was one of them.

376
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,032
Wouldn't even visit. Take the trial run.

377
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,639
Shit.

378
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,877
I didn't know if I wanted to try it,
but... I mean...

379
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,269
Jesus, without this place,
I never would've met someone like you.

380
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,037
Yeah, you could have.
- No, I wouldn't.

381
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,280
We could have met outside all this.
- No.

382
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,593
You... would not have got me at all.

383
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,959
At all.

384
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,597
If we really met, I mean...

385
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,958
If we really met,
you... you wouldn't like me.

386
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,280
Try me.

387
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,353
Or you'd...

388
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,638
You wouldn't want
to spend time with me.

389
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,637
You'd come and then...
- Try me.

390
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,159
Why?

391
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,634
Why? What's the point?

392
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,317
What? Where are you? Houston?

393
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,399
Carson City, Nevada.

394
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,434
So come on.

395
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,589
I showed you mine.

396
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,753
Where are you?

397
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,072
I can just look it up.
- Santa Rosa, California.

398
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,795
That's no distance.
- I don't want you to.

399
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,153
I don't want you to see me.

400
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,111
I mean, I'm scared that...
- And I'm dying.

401
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,750
Whatever you are can't scare me.

402
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,478
Let me come visit.

403
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,752
I want to say hi.

404
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,559
Here you go.

405
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,836
You OK?

406
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,555
Please check in at our self-service pods

407
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,477
using swipe cards provided.

408
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,310
You must be Kelly.
- I guess I must.

409
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,795
She's waiting for you.
- Thank you.

410
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,274
Please.

411
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,913
She won't be able
to physically respond in any way.

412
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,439
But she can hear you.

413
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,073
I'll give you some privacy.

414
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,354
Hello, stupid.

415
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,273
It's good to see you.

416
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,279
Hello.

417
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,073
Excuse me. Is it... Kelly?

418
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,076
It is.

419
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,119
I'm Greg.
- You're Greg?

420
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,317
Well, holy shit.

421
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,552
You know, I think it's great
that you came down here in person

422
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,829
before she passes over.

423
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,757
Even her folks don't come visit
no more, so...

424
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,120
She's passing over?

425
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,278
When?

426
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,589
Let's go grab a coffee.
- OK.

427
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,077
So she didn't tell you?
- No, she did not.

428
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,836
Said she was just visiting.
- More like sampling the trial version.

429
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:40,438
I mean, I've only known her
the past three years.

430
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,235
We talk on the comm box.

431
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,397
She told you how she ended up
quadriplegic?

432
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,192
And how long she's been that way?

433
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,236
One night, she's 21,
comes out to her folks.

434
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,954
They're a little uptight about it,
you might say.

435
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,872
Tell her they don't want
a gay daughter.

436
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,638
It's not natural and so forth.

437
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,193
They fight. She gets in her car.
Runs it off the road. Boom.

438
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,392
- When she was 21?
- More than 40 years back.

439
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,229
It's been her whole lifetime,
basically.

440
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,113
So the whole San Junipero system
has been a big deal for her.

441
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,639
I mean, the biggest deal.

442
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,709
Of course now, until she passes over,
it goes permanent

443
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,195
she's on the five-hour weekly limit.

444
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,560
I guess you're the same.

445
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,710
They ration it out.
They don't trust us with more.

446
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,673
They say you go crazy
if you have too much, you know?

447
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,792
You don't leave your seat.
You disassociate body from mind.

448
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,071
Like that doesn't happen
in every senior home already.

449
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,354
The system's there
for therapeutic reasons.

450
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,710
Immersive nostalgia therapy.

451
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,590
Plunge you into a world of memories.

452
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,318
Helps with Alzheimer's.

453
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,000
That's what they say.
- Well, small mercies.

454
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,080
So...

455
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,910
About this marriage...

456
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,198
The state's got a triple lockdown
on euthanasia cases.

457
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,199
You gotta have a sign-off from the doc,
the patient, a family member.

458
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,438
It's to stop folks from passing over just
because they prefer San Junipero flat out.

459
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,429
Anyhow, Yorkie's family...

460
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,120
they're big-time religious,
and they will not sign.

461
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,071
But a spouse can override that.

462
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,959
Hence the wedding bells.
- You got it.

463
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,876
We got a pastor coming
tomorrow a.m.

464
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,673
and then she's scheduled to pass
tomorrow afternoon.

465
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,076
'Scheduled to pass.'
Let's just call it dying.

466
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,350
If you can call it dying.

467
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,233
Uploaded to the cloud, sounds like heaven.

468
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,480
I guess.

469
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,798
You gonna wear a suit?

470
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,874
The ceremony's on my coffee break.

471
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,711
I never married so I just figured,
you know, what's the harm?

472
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,512
You're a good man.

473
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,759
It's the least I could do, right?

474
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,195
You think you could hook us up
to the system now?

475
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,712
Just for a little while,
before she passes?

476
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,469
You can still see her afterwards.
I mean, then she's no limit.

477
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,319
She's full-fat, permanent San Juniperan.

478
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,556
I know. But can you?

479
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,240
Seriously, it is so tight here
that they monitor every...

480
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,317
I only want a moment.

481
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,310
Ma'am.

482
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,399
You got five minutes
- Thank you.

483
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,114
Hey!

484
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,357
I haven't been here during the daylight.

485
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,550
It's warm.

486
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,319
Listen, I gotta be quick.
So I spoke to Greg.

487
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,633
You're passing over tomorrow?
- Yeah.

488
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,830
A couple of hours
after the wedding.

489
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,592
So I guess I am technically
honeymooning here forever.

490
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,351
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
- Shh, shh, shh.

491
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,437
I'm gonna say something crazy.
- OK.

492
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,234
Wanna marry me instead?

493
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,310
It's just...
Greg seems great, but...

494
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,272
Why not someone
you've connected with?

495
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,591
Is that a yes?

496
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,393
...to be your lawfully wedded wife

497
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,674
to have and to hold,
in sickness and in health...

498
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:18,316
In good times and in woe,
for richer, for poorer...

499
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,640
Hold tight.

500
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,159
There you go.

501
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,914
Nearly there.

502
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,835
That's it.

503
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,479
You're sure you're alright?

504
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,909
Hey!

505
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,638
You didn't dress up to see me?

506
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,953
Come on!

507
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,630
Better?

508
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,875
Whoop!

509
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,031
Woo!

510
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,033
Looks so real.

511
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,078
It feels so real!

512
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,070
- What are you doing?
- I love it here!

513
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,560
I just love it.

514
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,797
You've been here before.
- But now I live here!

515
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,839
Be with me.

516
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,759
I'm with you now.
- That's not what I mean.

517
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,035
Pass over.

518
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,518
When it's your time, when you're ready.
- Yorkie.

519
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,951
Stay here with me.
- Can we just enjoy tonight?

520
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,718
It's almost midnight.

521
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,753
In ten minutes, you're out of here.

522
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,234
Then I gotta wait a week
to see you again.

523
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,669
You know I'm just a visitor.
- What, a couple of months, then what?

524
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,193
We're not discussing this.
- Then you're gone.

525
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,234
Just gone. You could have forever.
- Forever?

526
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,432
Who can even make sense of forever?
- However long you want, then.

527
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,869
I mean, you can remove yourself
like that.

528
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,274
It's not a trap.

529
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,360
I mean, look at it!

530
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,514
Jesus! Touch it!

531
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,915
- I'm going.
- Hey! Hey.

532
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,755
It's real.

533
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,149
This is real.

534
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,830
And this.

535
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,638
Come on.

536
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,557
You know that was just a gesture.

537
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,711
You married me.
- To help you pass over.

538
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,629
As a... kindness.

539
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,312
It's not so kind to leave.

540
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:10,238
OK, look, look, I'm sorry, I just...

541
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,077
I got this chance.

542
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,553
We got this chance.
I want to share it with you.

543
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,038
I said I made my choice.

544
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,112
What is it? You feel bad
because your husband isn't here?

545
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,513
Because that was his choice.
- Don't.

546
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,552
He chose not to stay here.
It's like he left you.

547
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,592
You know, he could have stayed,
but he chose to leave you.

548
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,995
You don't know what you're saying.
- You should be mad at him.

549
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,111
Not whipping yourself with guilt.
- Get off me.

550
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,040
You can't see it!
But what he did, it was selfish actually...

551
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,432
49 years...

552
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:59,633
I was with him for 49 years.

553
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,194
You can't begin to imagine.

554
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,873
You can't know.

555
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,480
The bond, the commitment,
the boredom

556
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,955
the yearning, the laughter,
the love of it.

557
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,435
The fucking love.
You just cannot know!

558
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,476
Everything we sacrificed.

559
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,196
The years I gave him.
The years he gave me.

560
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,909
Did you think to ask?

561
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,275
Did it occur to you to ask?

562
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,239
We had a daughter.

563
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,399
Alison.

564
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,675
Always difficult, always beautiful.

565
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,039
Died at 39 years old, bless her heart.

566
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,072
And Richard and I,
we felt that heartbreak as one.

567
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,389
You think you're the only person
ever suffered, go fuck yourself.

568
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,114
- I didn't know...
- Didn't think to.

569
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,794
You know, when he was dying,
Rich said to me

570
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:04,515
when they offered him this,
to pass over, pass through,

571
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,234
spend eternity in this fucking graveyard
you're so in love with

572
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,634
he said, 'How can 77

573
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,997
'When she missed out, how can I?'

574
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,678
And so he went.

575
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,838
And I wish I could believe
he's with her now

576
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,553
that they're together, but I don't.

577
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,478
I believe they're nowhere.
Just like you said.

578
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:30,117
Gone. No, I pitied you,
and that's the truth. I pitied you.

579
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,639
And now you give me
some sales pitch

580
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,637
about how fucking peachy forever
could be.

581
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,750
I'm sorry.

582
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,871
You wanna spend forever
somewhere nothing matters?

583
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,757
End up like Wes?

584
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,111
All those lost fucks at the Quagmire

585
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,276
trying anything to feel something,
go ahead.

586
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,313
But I'm out. I'm gone.

587
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,234
Kelly, I'm sorry.

588
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,598
Kelly!

589
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,193
Hey, Kelly.

590
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,032
You alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

591
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,594
Well, OK then.

592
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,510
Kelly?

593
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,676
All things considered...

594
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,318
I guess I'm ready.

595
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,550
For what?

596
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,912
For the rest of it.

597
