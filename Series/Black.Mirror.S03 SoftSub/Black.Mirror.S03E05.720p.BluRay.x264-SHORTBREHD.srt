1
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,715
OK, my people!
Rise and shine. Get up, Stripe.

2
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,470
Hey. You awake yet?

3
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,191
Yeah, sure as shit
ain't dreaming no more.

4
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,514
Company!

5
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,951
Something went down last night
in Her Falls

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,196
a village about three miles east.

7
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,359
We've got reports of a food store
broken into, shit stolen.

8
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,633
Locals think it's roaches.

9
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,114
Roaches!

10
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,039
We head out in five minutes. Let's go!

11
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,913
Hey, so, it looks like you're getting
your first real-live roach hunt?

12
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,230
Hey, new!

13
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,670
New!

14
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,716
It's Stripe.

15
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,471
Here's a little tip just in case
you get your first toe-to-toe

16
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,158
with one of them roaches today.

17
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,793
When you see one right here

18
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,356
try not to shit your pants.
It's only gonna piss them off.

19
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,236
I'll try.
<i>-</i> Try to ignore Len.

20
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,669
His aim's so bad,
he's the only guy on Earth

21
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,836
who could shit his own pants and miss.

22
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,231
Fuck you, farm girl.
- Farm girl?

23
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,510
Yeah.
Hunting's in my blood.

24
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,632
Some of us are naturals.
- Moving out!

25
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,797
Woo! Yeah!

26
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,877
Whoa, whoa, whoa. OK.

27
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,119
You can speak now.

28
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,754
It must have been roaches.</i>

29
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,918
Roaches, you see them?
You see?

30
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,679
/ didn't see them.

31
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,918
! heard them.
All the mess. It must have been them.

32
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,190
Want a cookie?

33
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,675
Here you go.
- They've been in the food.

34
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,557
We'll have to destroy
everything they left.

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,799
No one will eat it.

36
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,158
We can replace that, OK?

37
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,998
They destroyed the cooler.
Broke it and took the parts.

38
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,910
The cooler?
They stole parts from the cooler?

39
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,878
Which way did they go?

40
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,190
There were footprints
in the dirt leading that way.

41
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,073
Parn Heidekker.

42
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,991
Parn Heidekker.

43
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,236
Heidekker? Is that a name?

44
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,673
Stop them coming.

45
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,949
Please, you must stop.

46
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,910
OK.

47
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,473
I have child who is scared.

48
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,190
I will. I promise.

49
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,950
Stripe!

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,957
OK. Our friend here thinks
that the roaches

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,673
went in the direction
of Parn Heidekker's place.

52
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,870
Local oddball, seems to be some kind
of religious freak.

53
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,880
Anderson, Haque, I want you to stay here
and help them torch the food.

54
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,194
Keep them calm and reassured.

55
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,151
The rest of you, we're gonna
drop in on Heidekker.

56
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,756
Ask some questions,
sniff around the place.

57
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,235
If there's roaches, we show we're
ready for them. Let's go.

58
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,359
So Mr Heidekker is not exactly
what you call a socialite or a mingler.

59
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,073
Seems like mental health issues.

60
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,760
He's got some interesting views
on roaches, by all accounts.

61
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,871
I'm putting his info
in your MASS system now.

62
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,550
Been complaints lodged against him
going months back.

63
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,592
Locals claim that he let roaches
cross his land, left food out for them.

64
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,993
Could be just shit talk
from the local villagers though so...

65
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,191
Yo, how many roaches
we got left out here?

66
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,156
A couple of thousand?
A couple of hundred, if that?

67
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,076
I mean, back home
we had millions, man.

68
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,111
It only took two years
to get shit back on track.

69
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,039
Out here you got rustic fucks
throwing them scraps.

70
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,071
Man, no wonder it's taking so long
to mop shit up.

71
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,555
But how can anyone be dumb enough
to help a fucking roach?

72
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,034
Hell, yeah.

73
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,919
Portals front and rear.

74
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,669
Windows blacked out.

75
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,639
Chimney smoke. Someone's home.

76
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,631
Lennard, you use the boomer.

77
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,034
OK, MASS check.
Everyone got the layout?

78
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,990
- Check.
- Check.

79
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,310
Check.

80
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,716
Aikin, Balcon, Coach,
you check the outbuildings here.

81
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,398
Take 'em one at a time and slow.

82
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,913
Stripe, Raiman,
you come with me and Lennard.

83
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,598
We go in here.

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,276
Len and I will talk to Heidekker,
you check the rest of the house.

85
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,715
OK.

86
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,910
Optimal outcome, no shots fired.

87
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,395
- Except on a roach.
- Except on a roach.

88
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,069
Morning, sir.

89
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,191
There's no need for this.
I speak your language.

90
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,440
OK.

91
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,839
What is it you want?
- Just to talk.

92
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,315
That's what we're doing.

93
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,516
It'd be a little more neighbourly
if we did it inside.

94
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,396
Check the upstairs rooms.

95
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,998
Relax. I'm not your enemy.

96
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,879
Where are they?

97
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,033
Where are who?

98
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,869
You know,
we got a whole bunch

99
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,911
of frightened, angry people
in that village.

100
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,275
Roaches have been breaking
into the food stores, stealing supplies.

101
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,157
You know anything about that?

102
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,750
No.

103
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,192
See, it's not just what they stole.

104
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,951
All that food left is
gonna be destroyed.

105
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,957
- No one's gonna eat it.
- Stripe.

106
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,511
Makes life harder for everyone.

107
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,318
Cross on the wall there.
You got principles.

108
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,591
Think all life is sacred. And I get it.

109
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,629
I agree. All life is sacred so...

110
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,832
you even gotta protect the roaches.
Right?

111
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,715
It's not their fault they're like that.
They didn't ask for this.

112
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,195
I get it. We get it.

113
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,673
There's shit in their blood
that made them that way.

114
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,199
The sickness they're carrying.

115
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,271
That doesn't care about
the sanctity of life

116
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,560
or the pain about who else
is gonna suffer.

117
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,389
We don't stop the roaches,
then five, ten, twenty years from now

118
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,399
you're still gonna get kids born that way,
and then they're gonna breed.

119
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,830
Bingo.

120
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,316
And so it goes on. That cycle of pain.

121
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,114
That sickness.

122
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,159
And it could have been avoided.

123
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,355
Fuckin' roach nest.

124
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,354
You check in there.
I'll take the stairs.

125
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,553
Every roach you save today

126
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,231
you condemn God knows how many people
to despair and misery tomorrow.

127
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,595
You can't still see them as human.

128
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,434
Understandable sentiment, granted,
but it's misguided.

129
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,955
We gotta take them out if humankind
is gonna carry on in this world.

130
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,073
That's just the hard truth.

131
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,119
Gotta make sacrifices.

132
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,955
The fuck?

133
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,590
Help me out here!

134
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,596
Fuck!

135
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,360
♪ Try to shame me ♪

136
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,799

137
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,156

Rai.

141
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,557
Come on, we gotta listen to
Mr Sunday School

142
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,749
all the way back to base?

143
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,393
You can cover your ears.

144
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,640
Yeah, or...
I'll just hit permanent mute.

145
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,000
Lower your weapon.

146
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,674
Roach lover counts as a kill, too, right?

147
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,593
He's a civ, right?

148
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,639
You shoot a civ, that's gonna stay
with you the rest of your life.

149
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,191
Yo, Stripe, why don't you, 
pull the stick out of your ass?

150
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,800
Because I'm fucking with him,
not you.

151
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,353
I guess I had you both going, right?

152
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,275
Alright!

153
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,913
Let's torch the place.

154
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,074
Hey, you OK, man?

155
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,829
Yeah.

156
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,273
I heard you popped one in there.
- Two.

157
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,231
Wait, two?

158
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,635
I got another one, with my knife.

159
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,240
With your knife? Holy shit!

160
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,159
Pretty good, right?
- Yeah, you fucking Terminator.

161
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,599
Damn.
First time out, he gets two.

162
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,957
You lucky motherfucker, man.

163
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,319
Sweet dreams for this asshole.

164
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,993
Gonna get a treat tonight.

165
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,232
Woo-hoo! Woo!

166
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,714
I love you.

167
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,594
Whoa! Miss Sharp Shooter.

168
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,319
Patronising fuck!

169
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,513
Ruthless! You're the Grim Reaper.

170
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,029
Yeah, well, no roach
gets away next time.

171
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,159
Are you still sweating that?

172
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,873
Well, I grew up tracking deer.
You never give up.

173
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,237
I don't like it when they get away.

174
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,670
Nice.

175
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,677
Yeah, if that fucker made it
to the forest

176
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,280
he probably made it to the border,
gone for good.

177
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,879
Yeah, it's alright for you.

178
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,719
You popped two of 'em.

179
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,233
It's been a while for me.

180
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,115
You know,
the gal is getting twitchy.

181
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,559
Come on, Rai.

182
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,996
You sleep good?

183
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,599
Yeah, I slept OK.

184
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,311
What, that's all you're
gonna give me?

185
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,395
OK?

186
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,513
You know,
if I got two in one go

187
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,393
I would want to come
for like an hour!

188
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,432
Alright, shut up. Man.

189
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,429
Alright.

190
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,270
That's the way.

191
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,638
Hey, you OK, man?

192
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,353
Yeah, think I'm tired is all.

193
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,073
All right,
so you did have a good night.

194
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,911
39, 40, 41...

195
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,031
42...

196
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,632
43, 44, 45, 46

197
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,560
47, 48, 49

198
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,629
50, 51, 62

199
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,038
53, 54, 55

200
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,792
56, 57, 58, 59...

201
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,432
Strong and pure.

202
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,119
Strong and pure.

203
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,996
Hey, Stripe, you OK?
- Yeah.

204
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,391
I mean, I don't know.

205
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,909
I feel a little off.

206
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,590
I mean, I ain't sick or nothing.
It's just...

207
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,438
Report to the sick bay.

208
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,990
Running diagnostic.

209
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,069
What do you see?

210
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,030
A cube.

211
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,239
Rotating?
- Yeah.

212
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,154
And now?
- A tree.

213
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,878
Like an apple tree.
- Touch the apples for me.

214
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,270
Full marks.

215
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,111
So you say you had like a headache?
- Yeah, but just quick.

216
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,719
Nothing big, just...

217
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,433
Well, everything looks OK.

218
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,155
No sign of any malfunction
or dropout with your MASS implant.

219
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,079
And physically,
you're in exemplary shape.

220
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,673
You've just seen combat,
you can expect some sort of side effect.

221
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,350
There was this, this thing...

222
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,110
with a light on it at the farmhouse.

223
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,435
A roach had it.
- A roach had it?

224
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,949
Kind of like a flashlight.
- Flashlight?

225
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,355
Kinda.

226
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,040
I don't know.

227
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,071
Seriously, you're fine. Your MASS is fine.
Blood's fine. It's all fine.

228
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,070
OK. Yeah.

229
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,593
Maybe you should speak to Arquette.

230
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,079
Who's Arquette?

231
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,397
So, you must be 'Koinanchey.'

232
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,592
Koinange.
Folks call me Stripe.

233
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,190
Why would they call you that?

234
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,754
Couldn't pronounce Koinange either,
I guess.

235
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,476
That's funny.
- Thank you.

236
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,272
At ease, son. Sit down.

237
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,873
So you recently logged
your first kills?

238
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,558
Two roaches?

239
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,914
First time out. It's impressive.

240
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,309
Yeah, I guess.

241
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,155
So what happened?

242
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,197
What, with the kills?

243
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,915
I'm in this, farmhouse.

244
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,469
There's this, like,
hidden room or something.

245
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,037
We go in and there they are.

246
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,316
First one, I just... It was automatic.
Just pop-pop, you know?

247
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,794
Right. Just like in training.

248
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,753
Yeah, just like that, yeah.
Yeah.

249
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,998
And the second?
- I mean, he was on the ground with me.

250
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,110
He?

251
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,275
It was a he.

252
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,190
So, this was close quarters then?

253
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,749
Yeah, he was on top of me.
Struggling, I mean.

254
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,711
I couldn't reach my rifle
so I had to stick him.

255
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,390
Stick... stick /.
With my knife.

256
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,759
And how did that... feel?

257
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,153
What, like...?
- Emotionally.

258
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,310
I didn't.

259
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,351
I mean, it was quick.
It was self-protection.

260
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,076
I guess all I felt was, you know, relief.

261
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,315
Just relief?

262
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,034
It's not unusual to experience
other feelings, too.

263
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,230
A moment of euphoria even.

264
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,191
Yeah, I guess.

265
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,837
I don't know,
I thought maybe I'd feel...

266
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,069
I don't know.

267
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,076
Something else?

268
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,589
Yeah, like... regret

269
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,949
Something like that,
but that just wasn't there.

270
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,398
So you'd do it again?

271
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,993
Yeah, sure.

272
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,715
So... why are you here?

273
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,478
I don't know. I mean...

274
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,994
I had a few weird moments.

275
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,393
My MASS looked like
it was glitching out.

276
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,914
But your implants, I mean,
they passed every diagnostic.

277
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,429
There is nothing wrong with that.
- Yeah, they said it's fine.

278
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,478
I don't know, I think I just...

279
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,589
...felt like something was up with it.

280
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,079
But there's not.
- No.

281
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,512
You did a big thing.

282
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,838
You should be proud of yourself.

283
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,554
OK?

284
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,593
It'll pass.

285
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,273
Let's get you a good sleep tonight?

286
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,872
A real good sleep.

287
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,557
Fuck me.

288
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,439
Way to go, fuck fingers.

289
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,351
OK, it seems Heidekker
didn't stay silent too long

290
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,595
once we got to work on him.

291
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,755
He's given up a location.

292
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,029
Some place the roaches
have been scavenging.

293
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,354
Well, alright.

294
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,596
It's a housing project
that's been empty since the war.

295
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,710
It's not far from here.

296
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,320
So Control wants us to do some recon
before we go back to base.

297
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,395
Can we hurry it up here?

298
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,035
We ought to burn the whole
forest down?

299
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,070
Give those roaches nowhere to run.

300
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,233
OK, you see that?

301
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,632
Solar panel looks cleaner than the rest.

302
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,952
And there are some cables.

303
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,798
It's got to be roaches leeching power.

304
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,396
Why here?

305
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,149
Christ knows.

306
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,989
All right.

307
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,880
Better dial it in.

308
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,391
Control. This is Medina.

309
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,671
Positive ID. Signs of activity here
at the housing project location.

310
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,671
Sighted one solar panel.

311
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,109
Looks recently wiped clean
and some caballing.

312
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,917
Roger so far.

313
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,840
You alright there?
- I can smell the grass.

314
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,194
We can't usually smell nothing.

315
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,680
You ever noticed that?
- No, I never noticed that.

316
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,835
Requesting course of action.

317
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,757
Didn't read. Please repeat.

318
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,274
OK.

319
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,071
Control says we should fall back
and await comm...

320
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,793
Shit!

321
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,790
Medina.

322
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,191
Fuck.

323
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,753
Medina.

324
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,556
Stripe, get back!
She's dead. Come on!

325
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,432
OK. Ready? Cover me.

326
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,954
Rai! Rai, come on.

327
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,800
OK.

328
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,399
Fucking roach got a rifle.
Jesus Christ.

329
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,639
Fuck. Piece of shit.

330
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,557
OK, Stripe.

331
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,073
Stripe, come on!
Get it together, dude!

332
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,351
He fired six shots.
His rifle looks old, bolt action.

333
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,791
Should take him ten seconds to reload.
- We go in?

334
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,319
We go in and take him out.
You with me?

335
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,393
I'm with you.
- Let's go!

336
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,590
Follow me!

337
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,115
Ready?
OK, three, two, one. Cover me.

338
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,269
Come on, man! What the fuck?

339
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,152
What the fuck is this shit?

340
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,713
Let's go.

341
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,516
Stripe!

342
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,917
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

343
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,758
It's OK. Hey. Hey. Hey.

344
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,155
Calm down. Calm down.
Calm down.

345
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,840
It's OK. It's OK.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

346
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,080
Look, I'm not gonna hurt you. OK?

347
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,953
Go on, get out of here. Go on.

348
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,071
It's not safe.
There's roaches here.

349
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,234
Go on. Get.

350
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,555
Come on!

351
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,949
- Rai, what did you do?
- Shut up! Come on!

352
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,593
What did you do, Rai?

353
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,039
Got ya.

354
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,834
Rai!

355
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,632
Run!

356
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,193
What the fuck are you doing?

357
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,358
- You're killing them!
- They're roaches!

358
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,838
You're fucking killing them, Rai!
Fuck you!

359
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,833
I don't know what the fuck's
wrong with you, man!

360
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,553
You got some blown shit!

361
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,319
Pull it together!

362
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,994
You alright?

363
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,870
You gotta get out of here.
Come on.

364
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,999
Come on!

365
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,158
What the fuck?

366
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,319
Fuck!

367
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,633
You better run.

368
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,912
Shh. Shh.

369
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,394
Here.

370
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,519
I'm alright.

371
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,310
You see me as I am.

372
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,830
Of course I see you.

373
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,915
You don't see roach?

374
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,515
You ain't a roach.

375
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,233
Roaches is all...

376
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,919
Fucked up?

377
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,559
Roaches don't speak.

378
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,872
You just can't hear us.

379
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,556
The fuck are you talking about?
- Your implants. Your army implants.

380
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,274
The MASS system?

381
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,634
They put it in your head
to help you fight

382
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,752
and when it works,
you see us as something other.

383
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,869
One of us, Luka,
was making a... a machine.

384
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,430
Light flashes.
Said it can interfere with the implant.

385
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,793
You're roaches?

386
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,233
But I've seen roaches.

387
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,078
I've seen them,
they're fucking...

388
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,031
- They're like...
- Animals?

389
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,276
No, they're monsters.
I've seen 'em.

390
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,353
The implant made you see this.

391
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,916
Fuck.

392
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,076
The villagers?

393
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,160
The locals, they...
they ain't army.

394
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,311
They got no MASS in their heads.

395
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,634
They're scared of the roaches.

396
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,831
They hate the fucking things.
- Everybody hates us.

397
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,679
Well, what the fuck do they see?

398
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,360
The fucking civs, when they look
at a roach, what do they see?

399
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,109
What you see now.

400
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,074
They hate all the same
because it's what they've been told.

401
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,273
Ten years ago, it began.

402
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,796
Post-war.

403
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,873
First, the screening programme,
the DNA checks

404
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,311
then the register,
the emergency measures.

405
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,314
And soon everyone calls us creatures.
Filthy creatures.

406
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,272
Every voice. The TV. The computer.

407
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,994
Say we have...
we have sickness in us.

408
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,032
We have weakness.
It's in our blood.

409
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,913
They say that our blood cannot go on.

410
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,109
That we cannot go on.

411
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,673
My name was Catarina.

412
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,120
He was Alec.

413
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,237
Now we're just roach.

414
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,320
But now...

415
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,199
Now you see me.

416
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,039
Now you see me.

417
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,789
Rai?

418
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,158
Rai, no!

419
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,155
Tell me I shouldn't kill you.

420
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,713
None of it's true, Rai.
- What the fuck got you?

421
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,719
None of it's true.

422
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,359
Fuck you.

423
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,072
Get up.
Back against the wall.

424
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,030
Get up!

425
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,754
You want me to come in there?

426
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,279
It's alright.

427
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,357
I can just talk to him.

428
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,959
Thank you, Bradley.

429
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,909
Stripe.

430
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,277
We owe you an apology.

431
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,516
We didn't spot the fault
in your MASS.

432
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,518
I got you a coffee.

433
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,396
The device you found in the farmhouse,
you mentioned it to the doctor.

434
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,474
Is this the thing?

435
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,678
We found it on that old block
that you and Raiman were searching.

436
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,236
Looks like they reverse engineered it
from some of our drone parts and so on.

437
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,871
The light here
transmits a code.

438
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,875
It's like a virus.

439
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,560
It burrows into your MASS,
tries to shut it down from within.

440
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,836
I tell you, those roaches
are getting more ingenious

441
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,950
than we give them credit for.

442
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,318
The whole thing is a lie.

443
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,312
I understand why you'd say that, yeah.

444
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,839
Roaches.

445
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,719
They look just like us.

446
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,119
Of course they do.

447
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,079
That's why they're so dangerous.

448
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,279
Humans.

449
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,993
You know,
we give ourselves a bad rap

450
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,431
but we're genuinely empathetic
as a species.

451
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,757
I mean, we don't actually really
want to kill each other.

452
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,240
Which is a good thing.

453
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,038
Until your future depends on
wiping out the enemy.

454
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,350
Come on, sit down.

455
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,511
I don't know how much history
you studied in school.

456
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,957
Many years ago,
I'm talking early 20th century

457
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,196
most soldiers didn't even
fire their weapons.

458
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,950
Or if they did, they would just aim
over the heads of the enemies.

459
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,433
They did it on purpose.

460
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,275
British Army. World War I.

461
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,395
The brigadier,
he'd walk the line with a stick

462
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,670
and he'd whack his men
in order to get them to shoot.

463
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,318
Even in World War I, in a firefight

464
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,432
only 15%, 20% of the men
would pull the trigger.

465
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,872
The fate of the world at stake
and only 15% open fired.

466
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,479
Now, what does that tell you?

467
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,870
It tells me that that war would have
been over a whole lot quicker

468
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,230
had the military got its shit together.

469
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,796
So we adapted.

470
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,070
Better training. Better conditioning.

471
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,517
Then comes the Vietnam War

472
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,631
and the shooting percentage
goes up to 85.

473
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,670
A lot of bullets flying.

474
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,199
The kills were still low.

475
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,038
Plus the guys who did get a kill

476
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,993
well, most of them came back
all messed up in the head.

477
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,871
And that's pretty much how things stayed
until MASS came along.

478
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,433
You see, MASS...

479
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,039
Well, that's the ultimate
military weapon.

480
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,393
It helps you with your intel.

481
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,273
Your targeting. Your comms.
Your conditioning.

482
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,910
It's a lot easier to pull the trigger
when you're aiming at the bogeyman.

483
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,994
It's not just your eyes, though.
Takes care of your other senses, too.

484
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,199
You don't hear the shrieks.

485
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,471
You don't smell the blood and the shit.

486
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,233
They're human beings.

487
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,198
Do you have any idea the amount of shit
that's in their DNA?

488
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,717
Higher rates of cancer.

489
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:03,320
Muscular dystrophy.
MS. SLS. Substandard IQ.

490
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,239
Criminal tendencies.
Sexual deviances.

491
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,158
It's all there.

492
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,433
The screening shows it.

493
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,114
Is that what you want
for the next generation?

494
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,951
Don't feel bad about doing your job.

495
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,198
The villagers won't do it.

496
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,717
The folks back home won't do it.

497
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,353
They don't have MASS.

498
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,713
MASS lets you do it.

499
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,909
You.

500
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,276
You're protecting the bloodline.

501
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,597
And that, my friend, is an honour.

502
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,158
There's no honour here.

503
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,000
It's just Killing.

504
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,157
Lying and killing.
- No one lied to you.

505
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,754
You knew all of this. All along.

506
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,473
What are you talking about?

507
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,114
You agreed to have your MASS
implant put in.

508
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,471
Set up. Every soldier does.

509
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,157
We can't just embed it
and feed you a dream.

510
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,759
Your mind would reject it.

511
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,951
You have to accept it. Willingly.

512
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,960
It's exactly what you did.

513
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,916
So you see the terms
and conditions there?

514
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,712
Yeah, that's like
a whole essay, man.

515
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,955
What is that?

516
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,160
That's your consent video.
From when you signed up six months ago.

517
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,591
Basically, it says you agree
to MASS implant activation.

518
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,149
I didn't do this.
- Yes, you did.

519
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,079
- Works kind of like hypnosis.
- Yeah, alright.

520
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,990
Part of what you're agreeing to
is not realising

521
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,111
you've been put in this state,
I you follow me.

522
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,037
You won't recall
this conversation.

523
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,833
Yo, that's kind of funny, man.
- Turn it off.

524
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,114
- So for you to register consent...
- Turn it off, man.

525
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,798
...I'm gonna need
your thumbprint there.

526
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,309
- Right here?
- Yes, please.

527
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,472
That's dope.

528
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,920
I didn't do that!

529
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,678
I don't remember that!
- Just like the man said.

530
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,996
I know you're upset.
- Fuck you!

531
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,191
What's happening?
- We control what you see, Stripe.

532
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,393
I can't see nothing.
- Because we control it.

533
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,040
Give me my fucking eyes back.

534
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,750
Let me lay out your options.
- Give me my fucking eyes back, man!

535
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,952
Let me lay out your options!

536
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,150
Option one,
you agree to have your MASS reset.

537
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,429
All the recollections
of the past few days

538
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,711
including this conversation,
erased.

539
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,190
No way.

540
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,597
Option two's incarceration.

541
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,111
I'd advise you to consider.
- Fuck you!

542
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,751
MASS is a friend.

543
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:20,158
Without it, you will remember
everything that you did.

544
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,998
I ain't having this MASS shit.

545
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,909
No more. No way.

546
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,279
OK.

547
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,110
Well...

548
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,396
Maybe you should see what life
would be like without it.

549
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,354
What's happening?

550
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,635
Where am I?

551
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,798
Heidekker's ranch.
Three days ago.

552
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,717
I have it all logged, Stripe.

553
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,637
We can feed you everything
that you did.

554
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,119
Hey, no, no, no.

555
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,591
Please! Please don't shoot.
Please!

556
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,711
Please!
- Don't shoot!

557
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,239
- Wait! Please!
- No! No!

558
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,873
No. Make it stop.

559
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,116
No! Please.
- No, please!

560
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,878
Make it stop!

561
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,517
Please!

562
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,870
No! No!

563
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,079
No!

564
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,510
Fuck off! Stop it!

565
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,238
No!

566
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:01,396
You will see and smell and feel it all.

567
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,998
Is this what you want?

568
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,069
On a loop? In a cell all alone?

569
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,873
We can make that go away.

570
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,750
This conversation goes away, too.

571
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,915
All of it.

572
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,198
But you gotta say the word.

573
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,236
Just say the word, Stripe.

574
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,274
And it all goes away.

575
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,557
Just say the word.
