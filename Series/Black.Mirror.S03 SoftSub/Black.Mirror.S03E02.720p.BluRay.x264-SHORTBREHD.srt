1
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,076
I'm gonna have to ask you
to switch that off for now.

2
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,394
OK. Thanks.

3
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,038
You know what it's kinda like?
It's kinda like...

4
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,515
It's kinda like a rollercoaster.

5
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,871
You know what I mean?
It's like a roller coaster.

6
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,396
Try it, try it with me.

7
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,473
How tall... how tall is the Eye?

8
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,276
How tall... how tall is Big Ben?

9
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,038
Since then, I've been working
as a technology correspondent

10
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,151
for about two years now.
It's been great.

11
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,156
Cool, that's awesome.

12
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,635
So you do, like,
TV reports and, like, you're like...?

13
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,149
- No, just the website.
- Just the website?

14
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,750
I mean, there's some video stuff,
but tech industry pieces mainly.

15
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,950
Cool, tech, tech.
Tech's awesome. Tech's...

16
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,150
So where have you been so far?

17
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,838
Travelling around the
map like Indiana Jones?

18
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,950
Brazil?

19
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,479
Yeah.
- The red adventure line

20
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,352
goes zigzagging all
over the place.

21
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,791
Yeah, um, actually,
I'm almost done.

22
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,515
But I started off,
flew into Sydney, went to Thailand.

23
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,632
- Jealous.
- India. Yeah, um...

24
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,432
Did Rome, went to Rome.

25
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,074
Did the whole Europe vacation.
- Even I haven't done that.

26
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,269
Really?

27
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,631
It was... it was awesome.
I went to Pamplona in Spain.

28
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,990
Is that where they do the bull runs?
- Ran with the bulls.

29
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,872
You ran with the bulls?
- I ran with the bulls.

30
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,957
That's how I got this.
- Look at that!

31
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,195
You really are Indiana Jones.

32
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,594
Have you got your whip
in your bag and have you got your hat?

33
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,438
I do, yeah.
I saved the world from the Nazis.

34
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,834
That was pretty cool.

35
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,669
Like, you know, just... trying to do,
you know, shit I've never done before.

36
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,393
I mean, is that what you're
doing on this trip?

37
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,192
You're, like, finding yourself?

38
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,431
Yeah!
Um... in a way.

39
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,993
I mean, ... I...

40
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,316
I really needed to get away from
the family home is what I'm doing.

41
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,591
Yeah, that was...

42
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,720
Whatever, that's boring.

43
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,149
Yeah, well, I'm afraid Britain's
pretty tame

44
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,794
as far as daredevil opportunities go.
- Yeah?

45
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,309
It's alright, it's the last leg
of the trip anyway, so...

46
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,954
I'm unfortunately home next week.

47
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,558
Not much time...
- Next week?

48
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,353
- Yeah.
- That's not very long.

49
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,116
No, it's not.

50
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,518
So... I could use, some suggestions
on fun shit to do.

51
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,837
- Fun shit to do?
- Fun shit to do.

52
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,231
Jesus!

53
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,595
Hello.

54
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,075
I'm up. Good morning.
- Morning.

55
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,719
Another battle scar.

56
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,717
Kind of.

57
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,558
Let me guess, you were, like

58
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,480
totally shark fishing in
Cape Town, dude.

59
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,318
Is that your best
American accent?

60
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,671
Yes.
- That's pretty good. No, um...

61
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,840
It was courtesy of Josh Peters,
high school dick.

62
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,359
He and I got into a fight
in shop class.

63
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,710
And he hit me with this, like,
metal rod thing.

64
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,274
What an arsehole.

65
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,072
'What an arsehole.'

66
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,997
That's terrible.
- I am sorry.

67
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,396
Is that you or me?

68
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,999
It's gotta be you.

69
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,680
'Mom.'
You're so American.

70
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,520
Yes, I am.

71
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,710
Are you not gonna get that?

72
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,917
OK, that was a little impersonal.

73
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,400
What, you wanna talk
to her now?

74
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,158
You wanna talk to my mom?
I'll call her back.

75
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,476
Fair point.

76
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,840
I don't think so.

77
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,669
You hungry?

78
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,115
Wow.

79
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,109
Look at all these games.
You're, like, a gamer.

80
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,600
Cool.

81
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,834
Of course I am. For my job.

82
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,518
What, a girl never beat you
at Street Fighter?

83
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,753
Is this... Like, this is, like,
your dating manual?

84
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,919
What? The Singularity?

85
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,474
It's when computers learn
to outsmart man

86
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,079
like women did years ago.

87
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,634
Wow!

88
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,876
See, um...
what I was doing

89
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,433
it was like a joke.

90
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,675
You know?
- Really?

91
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,189
- Yeah.
Well, that's what you call a joke?

92
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,117
Yeah, you guys have those...

93
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,549
you guys have those here, right?
- Yeah, yeah. We do at the moment.

94
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,156
That was a good joke.
That was a good joke.

95
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,835
Enjoy your Marmite.

96
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,393
Whoa! My...

97
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,430
What?

98
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,153
Do you guys seriously
eat this shit?

99
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,076
It's f...

100
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,760
OK, alright.

101
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,076
Alright, saved by Mom.

102
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,351
The best way to actually just
stop her from calling is...

103
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,277
I don't know, answer it.

104
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,311
Yeah, it's just kind of like
a can of worms

105
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,874
I just don't want to open
right now, so...

106
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,709
She's worried. You're her son.
You've been travelling.

107
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,673
And I just think if you
speak to her, then...

108
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,237
Yeah, well, um, I still live at
home with her back in Syracuse.

109
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,715
That's... that's cool. That's fine.
- Yeah.

110
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,030
Um...

111
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,839
I was taking care of my dad.

112
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,949
Shit. Is he OK?

113
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,593
No, he died.

114
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,950
- My God. I'm sorry.
- Last year. No, it's OK.

115
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,118
It was coming for a while.
It was early-onset Alzheimer's.

116
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,959
God, then that must have
been really... er... tough.

117
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,196
Yeah, he was, my best friend.

118
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,435
Um...

119
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,471
Sometimes he'd just look at me
and wouldn't even know who I was.

120
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,110
Well, my mom, like, I don't even...
I don't know how to talk to her.

121
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,956
You know, like, I don't have
that connection.

122
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,593
I don't even know where to start.

123
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,633
So that's...

124
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,909
that's why I left.

125
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,395
That's why I went on this trip.

126
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,635
Just to get away and make,
you know

127
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,637
all the memories that I can...

128
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,474
while I can.

129
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,396
And I know I gotta talk to her
and I gotta just...

130
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,159
But not on this.
You know, I just...

131
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,829
I just want to deal with it.

132
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,632
I'll deal with it when I get back,
you know.

133
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,239
It's just...

134
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,870
You're a good guy, Cooper.

135
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,595
Call your mum.

136
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,912
Zero, zero, one, nine, three,
nine, two, nine...

137
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,840
No, I did not buy a pair of sandals
in Ko Samui last night

138
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,915
because I'm in...

139
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,637
And how long...
and how long does that take?

140
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,553
Because I need to buy
a ticket back to America.

141
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,993
My God.

142
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,675
Can I just say, this is the most
blatant cover story

143
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,074
for a second hook-up ever?

144
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,634
Yes! Yes!
My God.

145
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,149
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

146
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,191
Alright. Don't forget your bag.

147
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,390
The bag, yep, that's my bag.

148
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,590
Alright. You are a top bird.

149
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,790
I don't know what that means,
but I heard somebody say it once

150
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,035
and you're it.

151
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,718
I got a plan.

152
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,278
Yeah. It's, um, OddJobs.

153
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,234
For who?
- For, like... It's an app.

154
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,634
You can kind of...

155
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,389
Like, I've used it all over
when funds were low, so...

156
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,238
- Some interesting ones.
- ...it's pretty cool.

157
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,636
'Thrill seekers wanted.'
- Ooh!

158
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,231
This looks right up your street.
- OK.

159
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,069
OK, four pound signs.
That's a biggie. That's good.

160
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,632
It's a little out of town.

161
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,676
And some kind of play test deal
for a company called Saito...

162
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,119
Saitogoo...

163
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,913
- Saitogemu?
- Saitogemu. Yeah.

164
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,155
They're huge.

165
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,669
They're really big.
- Really?

166
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,393
Horror games?

167
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,270
Have you heard of...?

168
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,952
What's one of theirs?
Er, Harlech Shadow.

169
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,399
Harlech Shadow? Yes, I have.

170
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,750
I used to play that in my buddy
David Ludwig's basement

171
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,552
when we were, like, seventh grade.

172
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,194
Well, that's Shou Saito.
It's his company.

173
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,039
He's like this genius, super secretive.
- OK.

174
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,037
And apparently they're working
on this new project.

175
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,071
Big money involved.
Ground-breaking.

176
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,713
But nobody knows anything about it.

177
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,070
Well, maybe if I play my cards right

178
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,670
I can get you an exclusive
with Shou.

179
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,076
Fo' Shou?

180
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,673
You should take a photo.

181
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,749
What, like...?
- Seriously.

182
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,918
If you get a photo of anything
that they're working on

183
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,600
that's a fuck-load more money
than four pound signs.

184
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,629
Cool.

185
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,636
Um...

186
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,199
Well, where is this place?

187
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,834
Mr Copper.

188
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,314
Hi. Um... Just Cooper.

189
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,431
Mr Cooper, I apologise.

190
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,790
Just Cooper is fine.

191
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,958
Then, in that case, I'm just Katie.

192
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,033
Hi.
- Hi.

193
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,199
- Follow me.
- Yeah.

194
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,356
I'll just get my pack here.
- Rav will take care of that.

195
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,118
Rav will...
Rav will take care of that.

196
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,992
OK, great.

197
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,077
That's good.
I don't wanna carry it in there anyway.

198
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,794
Rav kind of reminds me
of like an end-of-level boss.

199
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,878
You know... 'Haiuken!'
Just...

200
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,796
How was your journey?
- Great. Thanks.

201
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,480
The car pick you up OK?
- Yeah.

202
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,149
Wow.

203
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,154
This way.

204
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,509
Are they... seeing...?

205
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,995
It's cool. Very cool.

206
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,749
Wow.

207
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,950
Come on.

208
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,313
Feel like I'm gonna go meet
Dumbledore.

209
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,278
Hope I get...
hope I get Gryffindor!

210
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,316
I'm gonna need your phone
and anything else

211
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,998
you might use to send and receive.

212
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,473
A little paranoid, don't you think?
- Can't be too careful.

213
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,958
OK, there you go.

214
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,512
Wow, you really are paranoid.
Whoa!

215
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,479
It's white.

216
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,079
Um...

217
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,399
OK, so I'm guessing this says, like,
I agree to have my kidneys harvested?

218
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,193
Actually, it's a pretty standard
NDA-disclaimer thing.

219
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,230
OK.

220
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,875
It's important that you realise there
is a small medical procedure involved.

221
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,915
Sorry, for a game?

222
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,474
Nothing permanent
and we don't harvest your kidneys.

223
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,999
I promise.
- OK.

224
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,997
It's no more invasive
than having your ears pierced.

225
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,078
Confidential information,
brain downloaded into the game...

226
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,793
Duration, termination..."

227
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,037
Um, the signature page...

228
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,552
Where do I sign?

229
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,240
The signature... Yeah.
- There's a page missing.

230
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,112
OK.
- Just a moment.

231
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,472
Alright. I'll just wait... here.

232
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,195
What the fuck?

233
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,399
All good?
- All good.

234
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,435
What we're working on is an interactive
augmented reality system.

235
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,871
Like VR?
- More like layers on top of reality.

236
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,591
OK. Um...

237
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,160
Um...

238
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,156
What's that?
- We call this a mushroom.

239
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,430
Like... Mario Brothers?
- If you like.

240
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,279
You're qualified
to do this, right?

241
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,833
I haven't killed anyone yet.

242
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,589
May 1?

243
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,359
Yeah.

244
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,669
All done.

245
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,399
- That was it?
- See, I told you I'm good.

246
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,797
Don't worry,
it's not permanent.

247
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,194
Um...

248
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,758
OK. What is this, like,
some kind of like memory test

249
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,120
or something like that?

250
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,470
- You'll find out.
- OK.

251
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,831
You might feel a slight twinge
as it initialises.

252
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,191
OK. Um...

253
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,880
Commencing at 5:38.

254
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,113
You ready?
- Yes, sir!

255
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,199
Nearly there.

256
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,111
I thought I turned that off.

257
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,512
All done. You feel OK?

258
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,995
I feel great.

259
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,149
Watch the targets.
- OK.

260
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,035
Um...

261
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,955
Is...?

262
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,113
What do you see?

263
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,952
Like a... um...

264
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,513
Like a video game gopher.

265
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,954
Is there more detail now?
- Yeah.

266
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,434
Yep, yeah.

267
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,316
And now?
- Holy fuck!

268
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,873
- Ta-dah!
- Holy shit!

269
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,638
He... Fuck. He's right...

270
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,990
He's right... He's right... Can I...?

271
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,715
Whoo!

272
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,876
He's not real.
He's just a sort of mental projection.

273
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,833
You can see him. I can't.
- You can't? The...

274
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,675
Wow!

275
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,631
OK.

276
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,549
Give him a whack.

277
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,514
Give him a whack?
OK, alright.

278
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,029
OK! Alright, so just like
whack-a-mole.

279
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,798
I've played it a million times. OK.

280
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,195
Alright.

281
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,629
Here we go. Come on up.

282
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,629
Where you coming up?

283
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,113
No. No.

284
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,356
No.

285
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,759
Alright. Stay down.

286
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,838
OK. Stop. Got it.

287
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,669
Good game. Very good game.
You are so adorable!

288
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,916
OK. Bye.

289
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,234
Bye.

290
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,191
- Is that it?
- Afraid so.

291
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,590
Now, were the gophers
two-dimensional or three?

292
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,669
Three. No, no, no.
3D, super 3D. Like... Yeah.

293
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,556
And this is just a limited test demo.
- That was a demo?

294
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,638
I think you should beta test the full
experience we're working on.

295
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,717
There'd be more money in it,
of course.

296
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,239
If you're game?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

297
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,999
Yeah, I'm game.
I'm game.

298
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,473
This is Shou Saito.

299
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,229
You must be our latest volunteer.
- Hi.

300
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,910
This is really great. Hi.
- Konnichiwa.

301
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,600
Ko... Konnichiwa. Hi.
- Nice.

302
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,235
Um, I just... I wanted to say that
the mole game...

303
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,793
Super fun.

304
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,559
Super fun... fun.

305
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,114
Fun?
- Fun.

306
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,629
- Fun is good.
- Yeah.

307
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,069
Playing games is... is good.

308
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,918
Your heart goes faster.

309
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,829
You smile.
- Yeah.

310
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,952
Yeah. Or, um... scream.
Right?

311
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,314
I have always liked
to make the player jump.

312
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,919
Frightened.

313
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,997
You get a scare, you jump.

314
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,190
Afterwards, you feel good.
- Yeah.

315
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,435
You glow.

316
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,075
Why?

317
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,958
Um...

318
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,718
Because of the adrenaline rush.

319
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,595
Yes.
- Yeah.

320
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,952
But mostly because you
are still alive.

321
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,959
You have faced your greatest fears
in a safe environment.

322
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,470
It is a release of fear.
It liberates you.

323
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,033
Yeah. I mean, totally.

324
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,879
What we are working on now

325
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,629
is the most personal survival
horror game in history.

326
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,115
Wow. Cool.

327
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,596
One that works out how to scare you
by using your own mind.

328
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,235
Whoa.
That... that sounds crazy.

329
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,995
Can't wait.

330
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,034
I'm uploading a neural net package.

331
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,276
Neural net packing, neural net.

332
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,709
Name could use a little work, I think.
It's all 90s.

333
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,113
I'm just kidding, it's a good name.

334
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,595
It's state of the art intelligent
software.

335
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,516
It learns and adapts
on the fly.

336
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,198
It'll monitor your brain activity

337
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,151
and try and work out
how best to frighten you

338
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,510
and then adjust your
experience accordingly.

339
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,516
Whoa!

340
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,198
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

341
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,437
Beam me up. Here we go, lock and load.
- Eyes closed.

342
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,917
- Time is currently 6:17 p.m.
- OK.

343
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,914
It's uploading.
Five, four, three, two, one.

344
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,319
How are you feeling?

345
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,198
Um...

346
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,396
I feel good. I feel normal.

347
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,875
OK. Stand up, slowly.

348
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,439
Are you ready to play?

349
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,549
Isn't this
the Harlech Shadow house?

350
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,034
Well, it's part of the estate.

351
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,753
The gamekeeper's lodge,
actually.

352
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,552
But, yeah, this was the model.

353
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,718
The layout was replicated for
the game and the textures scanned.

354
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,439
Wow!

355
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,676
Very, very cool.

356
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,749
So, what's the game?
What do I do?

357
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,440
You don't have to do anything.

358
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,154
You just stay in here alone.

359
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,079
See how long you last until
you're too scared to continue.

360
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,680
So all I have to do is,
like, stay here?

361
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,677
And I get paid for that?

362
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,439
I'll be back in the control room,
watching.

363
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,439
There are cameras all over,
so no stealing the silverware.

364
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,436
And now there's this.

365
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,312
OK... And what's this?
- It's an earpiece.

366
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,194
Yeah.

367
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,800
Just pop it in, and you and I will be
in contact the whole time.

368
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,274
Cool.

369
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,152
And I can, like, talk to you,
and you'll hear it?

370
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,271
Right.
- Great, great, that's great.

371
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,675
Now, nothing you'll see can
physically harm you.

372
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,109
It's all just audio-visual,
like the gopher game.

373
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,116
OK.

374
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,312
But if it does get too intense,
we can pull you out at any time

375
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,510
and stop the experiment.
- OK.

376
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,517
Is there a safe word
you can think of?

377
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,471
Something easy to remember it
under stress?

378
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,955
How about the word 'stop'?

379
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,349
Good choice. 'Stop' it is.
- Yeah.

380
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,391
OK, we'll leave you
to enjoy your evening.

381
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,556
Alright.
- You'll hear from me in a moment.

382
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,318
And just make yourself at home.

383
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,920
OK, alright.
Well, take her easy.

384
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,519
Harlech... Shadow.

385
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,589
Is this real?
Yeah, yeah, it's real.

386
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,199
That's real. It's really dead.

387
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,718
- Cooper.
- Hey.

388
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,433
Are you hearing me?
- Loud and clear.

389
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,714
Reaching for the Dutch courage
already, I see.

390
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,879
I'm afraid that wine's non-alcoholic.

391
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,560
Lame.

392
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,393
Well, we need you with a clear head.
- OK. Fair point.

393
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,760
That's a fair point.

394
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,155
This is high-quality craftsmanship.
This is nice.

395
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,351
Yeah. It's good woodwork.

396
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,752
That's this place.
- Full marks for observation.

397
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,597
Yep!

398
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,759
Alright, there we go.

399
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,756
- Shit.
- What's up?

400
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,518
I just forgot I don't have my phone.

401
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,995
I keep going for it,
I forget it's not in my pocket.

402
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,473
And there's, no TV here,

403
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,830
Welcome to the 19th century.
- Yep.

404
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,520
No TV, no Internet, no wi-fi.

405
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,076
Yeah. No wonder people
were seeing shit.

406
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,191
Probably were just bored
out of their gourds.

407
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,277
Well, that's the leading theory
about ghost sightings.

408
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,118
The mind plays tricks
when less stimulated.

409
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,311
Fewer distractions,
people saw more ghosts.

410
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,795
Isn't that a nice piece of info?

411
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,672
Well, they got literature, though.

412
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,072
That's pretty sweet, right?

413
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,589
My God, I can't even remember
the actual last time

414
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,278
that I read a book.

415
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,073
To think people used to do
this on purpose.

416
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,396
I know. Crazy. Why?

417
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,958
You know, I don't think I've...
- Shh, alright?

418
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,832
I need to get into some
old-school shit here.

419
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,473
And concentrate.

420
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,113
Pardon me.

421
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,910
<i>Can I point out your heart rate
just increased?</i>

422
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,390
Yeah. Well, it should have
'cause there's a huge crazy spider

423
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,589
I just saw

424
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,711
You see a spider?
- You don't...?

425
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,433
You don't see that?
- No.

426
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,555
Don't...

427
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,279
Don't walk... Don't...

428
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,638
Holy shit!

429
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,320
Tough guy like you,
scared of spiders.

430
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,839
Yeah, well, I'm just not
fond of 'em.

431
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,837
It's worked out you're
an arachnophobe quickly.

432
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,315
- God.
- It's probing for weak spots.

433
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,519
God damn it.

434
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,709
Fucker!

435
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,679
Yeah!

436
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,395
Um...

437
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,559
OK.

438
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,352
Yeah, well, yeah.

439
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,916
Whole lot more realistic
than the gopher game.

440
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,553
It's good. It's good graphics.

441
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,838
It's good...
Yeah.

442
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,757
Weak sauce.

443
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,359
- What is it?
- Just a...

444
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,959
Nothing. Nothing.

445
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,478
Here with...
because there's a...

446
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,511
No. There's a light on...

447
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,072
now, in the... in the...

448
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,636
Can you... zoom in and...

449
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,715
Zoom in on it.

450
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,795
And you can see what
I'm talking about.

451
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,353
Whoa!

452
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,799
- Cooper...
- And now there's... Shh!

453
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,629
There's a guy in the window that...
And that wasn't...

454
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,038
Yeah.

455
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,519
And now he's gone.
Now nobody's in the window.

456
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,151
Which is the...

457
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,195
Yeah, there's a...

458
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,993
Just leaky pipes.

459
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,755
I knew it.

460
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,710
It was leaky pipes, like...

461
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,398
Holy fuck!

462
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,795
No!

463
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,430
Fuck!

464
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,760
OK.

465
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,556
That got me. You got me.

466
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,034
What are you seeing?

467
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,755
Like a creepy... fucking guy.

468
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,199
Wow, just...

469
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,875
My God.

470
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,513
My God!

471
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,674
He kinda looks like Josh Peters.

472
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,030
It's Josh Peters! You're Josh Peters!
- Sorry?

473
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,630
You're Josh Peters from high school!
From a guy I know at high school.

474
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,909
The system could be mining

475
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,519
some of your personal memories
for texture.

476
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,516
My God.

477
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,710
Was Josh Peters someone
you were scared of?

478
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,909
He was a bully.
I wasn't scared...

479
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,110
I wasn't, like, scared of him,
but he was a bully and...

480
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,355
Man!

481
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,711
Take a couple of Krav Maga
classes

482
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,953
and I would be ready!

483
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,958
I'd be ready!

484
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,632
Kali maa!

485
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,429
Dah!

486
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,990
I'm gonna get some wine
and re-up.

487
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,670
I'd offer you some, but I don't
think you can drink it so...

488
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,591
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

489
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,792
Catch ya later, Peters.

490
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,069
This non-alcoholic wine is pretty good.

491
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,954
I'm not like a expert or anything,
but it's kinda great.

492
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,873
Um. I was in France.

493
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,069
I stayed at this, like, vineyard

494
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,637
and they had this... this wine, like,
grape-stomping festival.

495
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,559
Now, that, that wine was good.
I know that.

496
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,557
You're being discursive.

497
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,672
What is discursive? Discursive?
- Talkative.

498
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,677
Rambling.

499
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,794
Is that a problem?

500
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,354
People sometimes talk more
when they're afraid.

501
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,357
Helps compensate for the fear.

502
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,391
- Masks it, too.
- Yeah?

503
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,954
Similar to when you've got
the TV on late at night.

504
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,676
The voices make you feel less alone.

505
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,797
Even though you are alone.

506
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,319
You, aren't scaring me, Katie.

507
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,995
Pity.

508
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,560
Is there like a refrigerator
here or...?

509
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,318
There's some snacks in
the cupboard.

510
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,558
Alrighty.
Eenie, meenie, miney...

511
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,758
...mo! Alright.

512
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,594
OK, ginger snaps.

513
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,079
Let's see.

514
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,236
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This'll do.

515
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,555
And that... um...

516
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,279
He's gonna be right behind this door
when I close it, isn't he?

517
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,994
Yeah, that's how this works.

518
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,315
Knew it.

519
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,514
Jump scares get pretty old...

520
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,190
Fuck!

521
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,472
God!

522
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,349
What the hell is that?
- What do you see?

523
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,673
Holy shit!

524
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,879
A fuckin'...

525
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,199
Hard to explain.

526
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,198
It's like a huge-ass spider
with a face

527
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,992
and dicks coming out
of his mouth.

528
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,439
It's...

529
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,472
Peters. Peters is inside.

530
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,118
Like a Peters-spider...
mash-up.

531
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,875
Katie!

532
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,590
Are you doing this,
or is this fucking me?

533
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,634
- I think that's all you.
- I'm so fucked up!

534
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,157
God! Fuck!

535
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,913
Holy shit, you're fucking gross.

536
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,233
Yeah...

537
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,998
Sorry, can you say that...
say again?

538
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,433
Katie, hello?

539
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,436
God damn it.
Katie!

540
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,314
Just... whenever you come back online,
just say the word.

541
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,836
No, I'm not scared, just... bored.

542
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,274
That you guys?

543
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,555
Coming to fix the earpiece?
That's probably... that's a good idea.

544
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,718
Yeah. Yeah.

545
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,790
Cooper, fuckin' man up!

546
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,435
Fuck it.

547
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,880
Come on!

548
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,829
You're in danger.

549
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,110
Sonja?

550
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,834
Now we're talking.
Alright, this is incredible.

551
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,158
This... very impressive.
I am thoroughly impressed.

552
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,113
I am... Wow! Wow!

553
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,597
You look so real!
You're, like, just like her!

554
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,392
I mean, wow.

555
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,277
Except... you're just
unfortunately not... um...

556
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,311
Cooper, what are you doing?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

557
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,395
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold on.

558
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,273
Cooper, you're in danger.
- Shh! Quiet. Quiet! I need to think.

559
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,836
You're fuckin' real.
You are real. You're real.

560
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,440
Cooper, you're in...
- You're Sonja. You're actually here.

561
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,120
Are you actually here right now?
- I'm real. I'm actually here.

562
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,753
- God.
- And we have to go.

563
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,791
And you have to listen to me.
- How are you here?

564
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,638
You know that photo
that you sent me?

565
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,035
Well, I dug around and apparently
Shou Saito took out a patent

566
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,436
for a computer brain interface
last year.

567
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,551
How are you real? I don't...

568
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,513
OK, fuck. I don't...

569
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,676
They brought you here!

570
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,234
You are, you're real,
and they brought you here

571
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,679
and they're trying to
fuck with me.

572
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,870
Nice try, good try.

573
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,434
I get it. It's part of the test.

574
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,073
His patent got rejected outright.

575
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,350
They said it was insane,
it was dangerous.

576
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,754
Wow. Really?

577
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,120
How much are they paying you?
Honestly.

578
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,639
'Cause you're killing it right now.

579
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,954
Cooper, have they given
you something?

580
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,911
Sorry, I thought you were fake.

581
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,270
But now I know that you're real,
I'm being a really terrible host.

582
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,357
I got some non-alcoholic wine.

583
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,959
Might put us in the mood.

584
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,950
Cooper, Cooper,
what I want to do is get...

585
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,195
We'll talk about it in the kitchen.
Come on.

586
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,512
Cooper!
- Sonja, relax, OK?

587
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,552
Give it up. I know, the jig's up, OK?
Let it go.

588
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,079
Look, Cooper, there's more.

589
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,794
Five people have disappeared
in the past year.

590
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,674
All tourists, all registered
with that stupid OddJobs app.

591
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,712
Yeah?
Wow. God, that's crazy.

592
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,434
Whatever they're doing to you,
whatever they've done to you

593
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,599
it's dangerous, and we really
have to go now, Cooper.

594
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,313
OK, OK. Alright.

595
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,432
Um, well, if your story's true...
- Cooper.

596
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,518
...um, then how'd you find me?
- What?

597
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,630
How did you know
where I am?

598
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,277
It's a games company,
I looked up the address.

599
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,789
Yeah, really?
No, no, no, no.

600
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,275
How'd you find me here?
This place.

601
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,038
I tracked you.
- You tracked me?

602
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,117
Yeah, with your GPS on your phone.
Find My Friends.

603
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,753
Find My Friends?

604
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,269
That would've worked,
but they took my phone.

605
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,358
And it's in a building, like,
a mile away.

606
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,438
So, yeah, nice try.

607
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,756
That's right.

608
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,077
So much for women outsmarting men.
Singularity that!

609
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,113
Look, all I'm saying is that

610
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,549
I think that you could've come up,
like, with a better story.

611
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,591
It could have been funny or...

612
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,834
OK, alright, don't be pissed.

613
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,434
Do you ever wonder how your
bank account got hacked?

614
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,709
What are you doing?

615
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,711
I cloned your card as you were asleep.
- Whoa. OK.

616
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,149
Put the knife down.
What are you going to do with that?

617
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,998
I drew your attention to this job.

618
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,040
Sonja, put the fucking
knife down, OK?

619
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,990
It's not funny.

620
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,872
Should've called your mum,
Cooper.

621
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,709
But you called me, and I led you here...
- Sonja.

622
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,239
You know what?
- ...like a breadcrumb trail.

623
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,753
Put the knife down. Drop the act.
OK, seriously, drop the knife, Sonja.

624
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,440
It's not fucking funny.
Put the knife...

625
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,271
This isn't what I signed up for.
I'm fucking done, OK?

626
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,313
Fuck!

627
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,317
Fuck!

628
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,273
What the fuck!

629
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,399
Fuck!

630
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,669
Holy fuck!

631
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,549
Fuck!

632
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,400
Stop!

633
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,551
Come on! Stop!

634
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,512
Fuck!

635
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,715
Fuck!

636
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,353
Fuck!

637
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,672
Fuck!

638
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,519
- Cooper.
- Katie!

639
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,153
Katie!
- Cooper.

640
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,474
Katie!
- Cooper, what's happening?

641
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,033
What the fuck happened?!

642
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,117
What's happening? We've been talking.
You've not been responding.

643
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,790
You said I wouldn't feel anything!
- What are you seeing? What's there?

644
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,992
Fuck! But she's gone now!
- Who's gone?

645
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,793
My God, I-I felt it!

646
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,559
There's a knife in my arm!

647
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,194
In my shoulder!
- Cooper, who was there?

648
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,959
- Fuck... Son... Sonja.
- Who?

649
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,594
Sonja. She's this girl that I know,
that fucking...

650
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,199
She stabbed me.

651
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,833
She had a fucking knife.
- Nothing can harm you...

652
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,077
Nothing can harm you, Cooper.
- No, no, no, no.

653
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,350
<i>She was solid.
- No, she can't have been.</i>

654
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,995
She... she...
I was stabbed! I would know!

655
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,680
Nothing you see can harm
or even touch you.

656
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,438
It's purely audio-visual.

657
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,471
There's no physical sensation.
- Fuck!

658
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,715
Yes, there was!

659
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,149
Cooper, you need
to calm down.

660
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,079
I know because I felt it, OK?

661
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,078
I felt her arm, it was warm

662
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,397
and I felt her fucking
stab me in the shoulder.

663
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,751
- That's not possible.
- My God.

664
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,997
It's not possible, Cooper.
- Yeah, it is! Yeah, it is!

665
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,873
Physical sensations shouldn't
be possible.

666
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,117
- Unless, I mean...
- God. Unless what?

667
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,434
! don't know.
The neural net...

668
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,118
- It could have maybe worked out...
- Fuck me!

669
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,470
...some means of replicating
physical experiences

670
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,592
but that would be unprecedented.
- Jesus Christ.

671
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,790
OK, you know what?
Stop the game.

672
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,195
I want out.
Just pull me out now.

673
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,358
Stop, stop, stop.
Safe word. Fucking stop!

674
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,552
- OK, OK, just let us work it out.
- God.

675
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,876
No, I want this fucking thing out now.

676
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,831
Cooper, do not attempt to remove
that yourself.

677
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,030
Removing it yourself
is extremely dangerous.

678
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,753
Stop that! That could kill you!

679
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,996
Just stay calm!

680
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,269
Is that Shou?

681
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,879
Is that Shou? What's he saying?
What's he saying?

682
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,194
OK, Cooper.
- What's he saying?

683
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,639
We're gonna commence
with deactivation.

684
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,478
That's great news.

685
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,717
We need you to follow instructions
and make it to the access point.

686
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,795
The access point?
Great.

687
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,751
Where the fuck's the access point?

688
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,519
- Fuck! More stairs? Come on!
- Just one more level.

689
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,393
Trust me.
- OK.

690
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,834
Left at the top.

691
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,872
OK, which door?
- Room at the end.

692
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,720
What is it?

693
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,952
There's gonna be something
behind there.

694
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,037
I can feel it.
Something like...

695
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,115
Like what?

696
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:17,074
Some personal fucked-up shit.

697
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,476
Like... I don't know, I could feel it
digging around in my head.

698
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,590
Cooper, get to the door.

699
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,109
It's gonna be like my mom...

700
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,831
I don't know, dead.
- Your mum?

701
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,030
Fuckin' swinging from a fuckin' beam.

702
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,232
Your mother is not in there.
- You're not in control of this!

703
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,038
It's in my head.
It fucking knows. It knows!

704
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,151
It knows!
- It knows what?

705
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,430
It knows I got this thing
with my mom.

706
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,359
Cooper, I promise you,
she's not in there.

707
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,789
- Now open the door.
- My God.

708
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,478
It's the only way I can get you out.

709
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,079
Listen to me.
- OK.

710
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,077
OK. Fuck. OK.

711
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,030
Whatever's in there cannot harm you.

712
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,760
But I can't get you out unless
you open that door, Cooper.

713
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,599
Fuck, OK.
- Would you kindly open the door?

714
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,916
Here we go. Here we go.

715
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,270
OK.

716
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,271
OK, OK, I'm in the...
I'm in the room.

717
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,549
Where's the access point?

718
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,360
Access point?

719
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,393
There is no access point.
- What?

720
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,712
!'m fucking with you, Cooper.

721
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,149
! told you to come up here to see
if we've broken you enough

722
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,191
to obey instructions
without question.

723
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,275
- And we have.
- No, no, no, no, no.

724
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,598
Katie, come on.
Katie, come on!

725
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,199
Katie, come on!
Let me out!

726
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,800
Katie, let me out, come on!
What the fuck!

727
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,597
What are you gonna do?
What are you doing to me?!

728
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,031
- Why are you doing this?
- You thought you'd see your mother.

729
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,232
- Fuck!
- What does she look like?

730
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,636
Your mother,
can you describe her face?

731
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,954
Um...

732
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,320
Her hair colour?

733
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,030
She...

734
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,196
Is she tall, short, fat, thin?

735
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,280
Where did you grow up?
- She...

736
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,154
What's your favourite band?
Your favourite flavour ice cream?

737
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,554
The name of the girl
who stabbed you?

738
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,956
You don't know any
of these things, do you?

739
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,638
Don't you think that's odd?

740
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,876
It's fucking taking my memories!

741
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,309
Overwriting them, technically.

742
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,873
Fuck.

743
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,752
Look in the mirror, behind you.

744
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,593
Do you recognise yourself?

745
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,477
Do you even know
who you're looking at?

746
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,713
Soon you won't be anything.

747
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,990
You'll be just like your dad.

748
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,633
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

749
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,114
That's what really scares you, isn't it?
- Stop it.

750
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,198
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
- You're going the same place he did.

751
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,038
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

752
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,991
You're going nowhere.
- Shut up! Shut up!

753
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:03,916
Shut up...

754
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,071
You should have called mom.
She's all that's left.

755
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,476
You abandoned her.
- No, no, no, no!

756
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,113
Get out of my head!

757
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,559
You'll never see her again.
- Get out of my fucking head!

758
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,829
You'll never speak to her again.

759
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,918
Never see her face. You'll be all alone.
- Get out of my fucking head!

760
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,395
<i>Get out of my fucking head!
- You should've called.</i>

761
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,351
You abandoned her.
- Get out of my fucking head!

762
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,277
You're a bad son.

763
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,630
- You'll never see your mother again.
- No!

764
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,796
You're going nowhere.

765
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,911
Straight into oblivion.

766
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,474
And you deserve it.
- My fucking head...

767
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,113
You should have called her.

768
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,559
Get out of my fucking head!

769
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,838
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!

770
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,757
Get it out of my fucking head!

771
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,394
Cooper, I'm gonna shut it off, OK?
I just need to connect.

772
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,839
Get it out of my head!

773
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,558
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!

774
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,749
My God.

775
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,199
Where am I?

776
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,998
Who are you?

777
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,714
I can't stop it.

778
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,159
I don't...

779
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,231
I don't know who I am.

780
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,634
So I...

781
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,432
So I need to go home.

782
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,518
The interface has data
tendrils like roots.

783
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,477
They've dug in deeper
than they're meant to.

784
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,152
Threaded through your brain,
taken over whole areas.

785
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,759
I can't stop it. I...

786
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,397
I can't remove it
and I can't stop it.

787
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,913
But I... but I don't know...

788
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,758
But I don't know who I am.

789
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,715
I don't know...

790
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,717
I don't know who I am.

791
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,513
I don't know who I am.

792
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,274
I don't know.

793
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:50,269
On behalf of Saito Game Team,
I most humbly apologise.

794
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,352
Who are you?

795
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,112
What have you...
what have you done to me?

796
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,996
What have you done to me?
- Put him with the others, please.

797
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,430
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no!

798
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,312
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Stop, stop, stop!

799
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,234
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

800
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,111
No, don't, don't!

801
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,798
Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't!

802
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,154
Stop!

803
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,796
No!

804
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:25,029
Fuck. Wow.

805
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,914
That was one second.

806
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,550
Either he's super susceptible to this

807
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,319
or the software is
way too powerful still.

808
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:38,069
It's jumped from zero to 18K
in five milliseconds...

809
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,756
I'm sorry.

810
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,751
The experience was more powerful
than intended, Mr Cooper.

811
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,839
I hope you can forgive us.

812
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,631
...all luggage under
the seat in front of you.

813
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,752
All electronic devices should now
be turned off and stowed

814
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,679
as they may interfere with the aircraft's
navigational and communication...

815
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,235
Mom?

816
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,800
Mom...

817
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,039
I have to call him.

818
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,430
Mom?

819
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,231
Why did Cooper go?

820
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,396
...- Mom, I'm right here. I'm...

821
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,078
I'm right here, Mom.

822
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,633
I have to call Cooper.

823
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,151
I have to call and make sure
that he's safe.

824
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,156
I have to call him. I have to call him.
I have to call him.

825
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,390
Mom?

826
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,358
Mom!

827
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,558
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!

828
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,238
Fuck.

829
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,195
'Mom.'
