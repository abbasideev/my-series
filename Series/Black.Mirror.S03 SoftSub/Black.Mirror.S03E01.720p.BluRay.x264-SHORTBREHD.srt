1
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,271
Hey, Lacie!
- Hey!

2
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,159
Ryan?

3
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,954
Ryan!

4
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,919
I was holding the bomb!

5
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,439
Come on!

6
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,675
Sorry, guys.

7
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,113
Landlord is sending buyers over
today so... put your pants on.

8
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,552
Maybe if I don't, it'll scare 'em off
and we can stay here.

9
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,195
Not an option, Ryan.
Lease is up in four weeks.

10
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,311
Hey, I'm thinking of you.
I've got somewhere to go.

11
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,351
Nate's roommate took a job in
Phoenix so I get his place.

12
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,075
OK.
- Now who's the slow poke?

13
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,194
I'm... seeing some places
over lunch.

14
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,598
Catch you later.

15
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,797
Sorry, that was my sister.

16
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,554
Yeah.
Yeah, I bet you'd love to.

17
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,280
Jasmine tea?

18
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,989
And that's one Brushed Suede.

19
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,511
Do you want a cookie
with that?

20
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,359
It's on the house.
- Sounds awesome

21
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,034
See you tomorrow, JJ.
- See you, Lacie.

22
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,395
I saw your boy in
the fire hat just now! So cute!

23
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,590
Yeah, he's really something.

24
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,519
Hey, Lacie!

25
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,916
Bets, it's great to see you!
- You too.

26
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,794
How's Pancakes?

27
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,118
He's hilarious.
Such a funny cat. Just the best.

28
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,117
You're still at Hoddicker?

29
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,391
Yeah. It's going pretty great.
- Good to hear.

30
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,636
So what brings you back here?
- New job, first day.

31
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,990
First day?
- At Blankman-Harper.

32
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,316
Whoa! Top floor! That's...

33
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,077
Well, good luck.
- I know, right?

34
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,952
It's great you're still happy
at Hoddicker.

35
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,150
Well, maybe not forever.
- No, not forever.

36
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,998
But for now...
- It's OK for now.

37
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,556
It's great for now, yes.
Yes, it is.

38
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,670
Lacie? Got you a smoothie.

39
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,400
Got one for everyone,
actually.

40
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,511
Still a bunch of 'em for grabs.

41
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,230
They're from the organic stall
at the farmers' market.

42
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,953
Sure. OK.

43
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,477
Thank you. Thank you.

44
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,275
We're kind
of not talking to Ches.

45
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,232
3.17

46
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,430
What happened?
- Him and Gordon split up.

47
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,878
Poor Ches.
- No, no, no, we're all on Gordon's side.

48
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,673
Sure. Obviously.

49
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,360
Ches is kissing ass.
Trying to scrape himself back.

50
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,751
Of course, if it drops below two-five,
then it's... bye-bye.

51
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,114
Hello?

52
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,993
- Yo, they're taking it.
- Who?

53
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,112
The couple the landlord sent over.
I heard them talking.

54
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,514
OK.

55
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,953
So, now we move into
the light space area.

56
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,400
Ideal for special times
with loved ones.

57
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,593
Great food, great company.

58
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,796
Whoa!

59
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,309
Sampled your
photo stream to make her.

60
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,799
Great hair!

61
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,911
Styled free of charge
at the members' salon.

62
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,955
My God.

63
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,157
It's hilarious!

64
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,760
You like him?

65
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,997
He's OK.
- He doesn't come with the apartment.

66
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,155
But there is a bar and restaurant
on site, tenants only.

67
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,433
We have unparalleled metrics
on romantic geneses.

68
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,435
I gotta say,
these places are going like that.

69
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,314
- So don't delay if you're interested.
- I'm more than interested.

70
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,035
Standard occupancy on a
minimum six-month contract

71
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,118
we're talking... this much.

72
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,959
How often are the payments?
- That's weekly.

73
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,114
OK.

74
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,470
A little more than expected?
- Yeah.

75
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,079
There's options.

76
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,555
You know our Prime Influencers
Programme?

77
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,319
Do I qualify for that?
- No. No, you don't.

78
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,589
We'd need you around
a four-five.

79
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,560
4.572

80
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,797
Hit four-five and there's
a 20% discount.

81
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,677
4.5,
- That's right.

82
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,074
You're so...

83
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,473
Pelican Cove?

84
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,589
What is this?
A eugenics programme?

85
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,191
A lifestyle community.
- No one is this happy.

86
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,069
A two-year-old with a fucking
balloon isn't this happy.

87
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,589
It's actually a pretty cool place.

88
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,914
Like you'd even qualify.

89
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,629
I'm so sorry, sir.
- I'm gonna sue your ass!

90
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,159
There's nothing I can do, sir.

91
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,714
Well, it's not hopeless,
you're clearly a tryer.

92
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,674
That's the sense you get
just from... me?

93
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,836
From your rep report analytics.

94
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,510
If we drill down into the numbers,
you have got a solid popularity arc here.

95
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,916
Strong overall trajectory.
Let's just look at the last 24 hours.

96
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,915
You see, even...

97
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,274
What's that? 8:40 a.m.
You're working hard on your socials.

98
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,357
Great little uptake there.
- OK.

99
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,518
Couple of minor dings there.
You cut someone off in traffic?

100
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,712
Just a workplace thing.

101
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,353
OK.

102
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,711
Let's check on your sphere of influence.
Let me zoom out here.

103
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,111
Great peripherals.
Strangers like you, that's a plus.

104
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,791
Healthy inner circle. It's good.
- Thank you.

105
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,435
There's a ways to go,
but 4.5 is certainly achievable.

106
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,200
How long do you think?

107
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,674
To hit four-five?

108
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,870
Well, barring a major setback

109
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,959
a public disgrace kind of deal,
I'd say 18 months or so.

110
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,278
I need more short term.
Like... much more.

111
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,754
Then you'll need a boost.

112
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,836
What kind of a boost?
- Well...

113
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,193
Most of your interactions
are confined to your inner circle

114
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,632
and they're largely, pardon the term,
mid-to low-range folks.

115
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,114
Same with your outer circle.

116
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,312
You've got a tonne of reciprocal five stars
from service industry workers

117
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,271
but there's not much else.

118
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,799
At least as far as I can see.

119
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,832
So in terms of quality,
you could use a punch-up right there.

120
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,157
Ideally, that's up-votes
from quality people.

121
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,597
Quality people?
- High fours.

122
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,190
Impress those up-scale folks,
you'll gain velocity on your arc

123
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,992
and there's your boost.

124
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,037
- Hi, JJ.
- Hey, Lacie!

125
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,071
Keith! Hello.
- Lacie!

126
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,433
- You look great today.
- Thank you!

127
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,394
Door won't open.
I'm on two-four.

128
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,831
Sorry, Ches. I'm late.
- I just need some stars, please!

129
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,070
Fuck!

130
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,436
Please.

131
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,273
- Hi!
- Hit

132
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,631
How's it going at Blankman?
- Just great.

133
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,675
Well, I bet you work... good there.
- Thank you.

134
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,158
Would you like a croissant?

135
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,271
They gave me an extra
at the coffee place.

136
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,994
- No, I already ate.
- OK, sure. All good. Yes.

137
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,909
Yeah.

138
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,036
Well, here's me, so...

139
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,999
Don't try too hard.
It's impossible to respect.

140
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,554
High fours can smell it a mile off.

141
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,637
You just be you.

142
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,956
Authentic gestures, that's the key.

143
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,391
- That's time up, I'll catch you later.
- Could I just ask...

144
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,720
Good... ol'... Mr Rags.

145
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,956
Shit!

146
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,835
The fuck is that?
- Tapenade. Want some?

147
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,632
Who even are you?

148
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,230
It's just something I wanna eat,
Ryan.

149
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,993
My God.

150
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,232
What is it?
- Naomi!

151
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,119
Shit!

152
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,749
Old school, el perfecto Naomi?
You guys keep in contact?

153
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,359
Ryan, just go!

154
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,754
Go!
- OK.

155
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,035
My God!
Nay-Nay, how are you?

156
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,594
I was just fixing myself a snack.

157
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,510
Lace, could I just say
I am so happy to see your face?

158
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,359
Me too. It's been...
- Too long.

159
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,311
Way too long.
- And that's my fault.

160
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,239
No, it's mine. Everything is just so...
- Everything's just so...

161
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,636
Crazy! It's so good
to see you.

162
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,957
When you posted that
Mr Rags photo...

163
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,071
I know, Mr Rags!

164
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,593
I just had to call
and talk to you because...

165
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,313
♪ Woo-hoo! ♪

166
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,993
Wow! That's a big ring!

167
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,792
Congratulations!

168
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,798
Who's the, um...
Paul?

169
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,390
He is great. So smart. Just sweet.

170
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,273
I know you're gonna love him.

171
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,233
So, anyways, the big day...
- Yes, when is it?

172
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,918
So, we're getting married
in a month

173
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,236
on his family's estate
up here on the island.

174
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,159
This place outside Port Mary,
Honeysuckle. You heard of it?

175
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,714
No, but...
- Well, it's a private island.

176
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,230
Take a look!

177
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,351
Wow! That is...

178
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,190
I know, right?
So... can you make it?

179
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,754
Are you kidding? Of course.

180
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,877
Great, cool,
'cause I was wondering if...

181
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,679
Lace, do you think...?

182
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,673
Would you be my maid of honour?

183
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,834
Seriously?

184
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,515
My God.

185
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,153
I mean, you've got such
cool friends now.

186
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,235
Are you sure?

187
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,715
Remember when we used to
plan our dream weddings

188
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,956
when we were, like, 117

189
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,551
I know but we haven't s...
- I don't know, just seeing Mr Rags...

190
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,309
All the memories.
It just brought things home.

191
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,509
Nay-Nay.

192
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,631
I know we haven't kept in touch
as much as I'd have liked

193
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,991
and that is totally my fault,
but this is a big day.

194
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,917
A big life day.

195
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,840
And I want my oldest friend with me,
my oldest friend.

196
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,553
I want you by my side.

197
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,960
My God.

198
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,354
Thank you.

199
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,239
What do I have to...?

200
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,590
Not much to it. A speech, mainly.

201
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,392
Speech? Of course!

202
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,319
How big's the crowd?

203
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,113
My gosh, like... hundreds!

204
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,551
It's a crazy guest list.
I'll send it now.

205
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,433
Paul's invited so many,
I don't want to call them big deals,

206
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,630
but they're all, like,
4.7 or above.

207
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,359
Nay-Nay, I will not
let you down.

208
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,155
Don't sweat too much!
Just talk about old memories.

209
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,919
Sure.
- How we were, any old things.

210
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,997
Gotcha.
- I'll ping you some anecdotes.

211
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,509
That would be great.
- And what's your dress size?

212
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,595
Um...

213
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,994
I'll tell you what,
I'll just send you a four.

214
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,075
Perfect.
- We got matching bridesmaids dresses.

215
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,111
Well, anyway...

216
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,078
Love you, Lay!
- You too, Nay-Nay!

217
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,674
Bye.

218
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,630
What was that? The M-word?

219
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,756
You two pussy pals now?

220
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,834
Shut up.

221
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,032
She was always mean to you.
- No, she wasn't.

222
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,960
She... she had that rhyme about you.
- That was a game.

223
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,391
What about when she cut your hair?
- I asked her to.

224
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,078
She fucked Greg.

225
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,751
She did not fuck Greg.

226
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,197
She looked hot. I'll give her that.

227
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,474
OK.

228
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,549
Impressive.

229
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,590
Jesus.

230
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,154
Yeah, that'd do it.

231
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,433
- Pelican Cove.
- Carole, it's Lacie.

232
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,994
Saw the place yesterday.
I wanna take it.

233
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,111
- That's fantastic!
- Yes!

234
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,835
I see you're still
on a 4.2. Is that, um...?

235
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,714
Yep, I'm on it, just gonna transfer
the deposit now.

236
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,512
- Well, OK.
- Yes!

237
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,515
In this world, we're all
so caught up in our own heads.

238
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,232
It's easy to lose sight
of what's real.

239
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,799
What matters.

240
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,990
But as I stand here today...

241
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,234
seeing the joy Paul
has brought to Naomi's life

242
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,070
I know she's someone
who truly matters to me.

243
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,155
Nay-Nay...

244
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,393
the little girl who, when we were
just five years old in art camp

245
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,674
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared.

246
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,593
The girl who helped me
make Mr Rags.

247
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,959
I still have him.

248
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,316
He sits on my desk and...

249
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,831
every day he reminds me
of Nay-Nay.

250
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,598
What she meant to me then

251
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,714
and now.

252
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,753
I am so honoured to be here

253
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,832
and I wish you all the happiness
this stupid world can muster.

254
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,671
I love you, Nay-Nay.

255
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,074
Is the tear too much?

256
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,159
You fucking sociopath.

257
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,760
Ryan, my car's here.
Was it too much?

258
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,360
What, the tear, the photo,
Mr Rags?

259
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,038
I do keep him on my desk.

260
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,720
There's sugary and
then there's fucking diabetes.

261
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,639
I just want to make her happy
on her wedding day.

262
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,991
The captive audience of four-point holies
five-starring your ass off.

263
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,235
That's just a bonus.

264
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,477
Naomi and I were best friends.
- Come on!

265
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,592
I wish her well and want to express
it the best I can.

266
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,950
And, yeah, if I nail a speech
and get five-starred

267
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,435
by hundreds of primes, so what?
It's a win-win.

268
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,758
What are you hoping for?
Like, four-three, four-four?

269
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,474
You get points from
your gaming buddies.

270
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,114
It's the same thing.
Don't shit on me for aiming higher.

271
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,480
Pelican Cove higher?

272
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,399
What's wrong with Pelican Cove?
They're great apartments!

273
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,636
They are fake-smile jail cells!

274
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,559
Great. Car cancelled.

275
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,230
And he marked me down so now I have
to book another and I took a ding.

276
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,989
Great job.
- I am sorry, but I miss the normal you.

277
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,238
Before this obsession, when we
had conversations, remember?

278
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,350
I need my charger.

279
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,758
This whole ranking thing,
just comparing yourself to people who...

280
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,952
Have you seen my charger?
- ...only pretend to be happy.

281
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,118
I said don't borrow this!

282
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,876
High fours like Naomi,
I bet they're suicidal on the inside.

283
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,718
My car is here. Again!

284
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,876
Your Pelican Cove deposit,
is it refundable?

285
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,433
Like, what if this doesn't work?

286
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,438
Can't you just stay out of my shit?
- You're my sister!

287
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,313
Yes! And if you cared about that,
maybe you would've noticed

288
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,319
living with you hasn't been one
big rainbow sandwich for me.

289
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,913
Do you know why I never
brought any guys back here?

290
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,430
Because I didn't want them to know
I was sharing a skanky-ass cave

291
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,598
with Mr Three Point Fuck.

292
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,316
Good luck with your performance!

293
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,079
Hi, hi!
I'm coming. Coming.

294
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,636
- Jesus Christ!
- I'm so sorry.

295
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,671
That's great. Just great.

296
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,838
Hi.

297
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,955
Nay-Nay!

298
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,037
Hey, Lace! Just checking in.

299
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,879
I'm on my way to the
airport right now.

300
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,434
OK, cool, and you're all good
for the rehearsal dinner?

301
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,074
Yeah.
The flight's, what, an hour?

302
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,555
That restaurant looks so cool.

303
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,514
- And you got the dress OK?
- In my case.

304
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,994
I love the pink.

305
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,635
So the latest draft
of the speech is great.

306
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,069
Going handwritten's so cool.

307
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,590
Those scans of the page, my God,
I welled up just at that.

308
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,031
- Thank you!
- Um... just one thought.

309
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,320
That whole bit where I help you with
the eating disorder thing...

310
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,510
You think that's a little...?
- A little over-sharing, yeah.

311
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,551
You're so right. It's gone.

312
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,433
OK. Cool.
Well, I'll see you in a few hours!

313
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,517
♪ I'm getting married tomorrow ♪

314
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,035
And here's your tip.

315
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,275
Thank you.

316
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,318
Come on.

317
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,636
Hi there, how are you doing?
- I am wonderful.

318
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,552
I am so sorry,
that flight is cancelled.

319
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,790
No. No, no, no.
- Customer incident at the other end.

320
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,439
But... So when is
the next flight?

321
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,518
Yeah, they're all kind of full.

322
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,155
I booked this weeks ago.
It's my best friend's wedding.

323
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,316
I'm sorry.
- I have to get there. I have to.

324
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,271
OK, let's see what
we can do.

325
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,357
Thank you. So much.

326
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,999
I see there's one standby seat
on another plane leaving tonight.

327
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,234
That's reserved for members
of our Prime Flight Programme.

328
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,191
You gotta be a 4.2 or over to qualify.

329
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,880
I'm... I'm a 4.2.

330
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,117
I'm afraid you're actually
a 4.183.

331
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,953
Well, that's not my fault.
Um...

332
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,673
Some woman dinged me down
and the cabdriver...

333
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,710
Can't you just...

334
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,797
I'm sorry, it won't let me book it
without the correct ranking.

335
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,354
But it's so close.
- There's just nothing I can do.

336
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,038
Christ, I mean, surely.
- I'm gonna have to ask you

337
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,514
to moderate
your language there.

338
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,998
Sorry. It's just...

339
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,519
I'm maid of honour.
I cannot miss this wedding.

340
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,712
And I am so sorry about that.

341
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,352
Can you call the supervisor?
- I cannot do that.

342
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,993
Can you just call the supervisor?
- I cannot do that.

343
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,872
Call the fucking supervisor!
- OK, that's profanity.

344
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,594
We're zero tolerance on profanity.
- I'm sorry. It's just...

345
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,916
I have to serve the next customer.
- No, no, no, no.

346
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,280
No, no, no, no.
- Can you step away, ma'am?

347
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,038
God, just fucking help me!

348
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,229
Ooh.

349
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,549
I'm so sorry.

350
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,233
- I've called security.
- No, no, no.

351
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,918
Please don't do that.
Um...

352
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,997
I'm... I'm...
five-starring you.

353
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,360
Five stars.

354
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,232
What's the issue here, Hannah?
- Intimidation and profanity.

355
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,590
- No, no. I was not intimidating...
- Don't speak, ma'am.

356
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,233
I was just trying to...
- Ma'am!

357
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,039
OK. So, in order to restore calm

358
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,390
I'm invoking my authority
as airport security

359
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,909
to dock you one full ranking point
as a punitive measure.

360
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,871
This is a temporary measure.

361
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,070
No! - Your score reverts to
normal in 24 hours.

362
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,793
No, no, no. But I need it now.
- During this probationary period

363
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,400
all down votes are subject
to a times two multiplier.

364
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,635
Times two?

365
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,637
We recommend you avoid
negative feedback at this time.

366
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,829
I'm on double damage?

367
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,316
Please, remove yourself
from the airport immediately.

368
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,273
OK, well, due to your ranking...

369
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,113
That's all I can do.

370
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,593
Thank you. Drive safe.

371
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,071
Hey there. Chuck! Great name.

372
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,953
Thank you.
- Hope you're having a great night.

373
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,719
It's pretty good.
- So I need a car.

374
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,878
You got a vehicle in mind?
- Anything, really.

375
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,389
Well, due to your current ranking

376
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,398
you're restricted to
our Super Saver Fleet.

377
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,398
Yep. That's... Yeah.
- I-Cruiser 2?

378
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,477
They still have the 2?

379
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,513
OK...

380
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,674
God.

381
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,274
Come on.

382
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,559
God damn it!

383
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,037
The little girl, who when we were
both five years old in art camp

384
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,074
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared.

385
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,991
The girl who helped me make
Mr Rags...

386
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,076
Teardrop. Crowd goes wild.

387
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,434
You can do this.

388
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,278
Sorry, OK, I swear I'm on my way.

389
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,958
How far away are you?

390
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,753
Quite a ways?

391
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,393
I missed my flight.
- What?

392
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,351
Well, not missed it but...

393
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,516
But... so you're not gonna make
the rehearsal dinner?

394
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,919
- Lacie!

395
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,520
I am so sorry. It's been...

396
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,714
I got a rental car. I'm driving.

397
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,239
Driving?!

398
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,473
That's like nine hours.

399
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,158
I'm making good time.

400
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,113
Gonna go through the night,
make a road trip out of it.

401
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,994
Is everything OK?

402
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,637
I can find a replacement
if something's wrong.

403
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

404
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,758
I'll be there.
I swear on Mr Rags.

405
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,357
OK, just drive safe!

406
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,710
You bet. I'll just...

407
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,634
Come on.

408
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,075
Come on.

409
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,599
Please.

410
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,075
OK.

411
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,390
What do you want?

412
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,031
Shit.

413
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,191
Hi. Sorry.

414
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,070
Your charger doesn't fit my car.

415
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,552
Don't see those around much these days.
- It's a rental.

416
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,875
Our chargers are Q2Z,
yours one's a K1.

417
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,839
They didn't give you an adapter?

418
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,395
No.

419
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,519
Do you have one?

420
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,312
Not in here. Ask around.

421
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,440
Thanks, anyway.

422
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,630
You're super helpful.

423
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,274
Two stars?!

424
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,514
Two stars?

425
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,673
Wasn't a meaningful encounter.

426
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,193
Sir, excuse me.

427
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,469
Excuse me, sorry.

428
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,319
Um, do you have a K1 adapter
by any chance?

429
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,918
Um, ma'am, how about you?

430
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,189
A K1 adapter?

431
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,436
Perhaps in the trunk
of your car?

432
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,800
Sure.

433
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,680
Great.

434
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,118
Ma'am, hi.
Do you have any adapters?

435
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,432
I have a rental car
and it's...

436
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,197
Slow down. Let's give her a ride.
- She's, like, 2.8.

437
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,473
Come on!

438
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,357
I didn't even do anything!

439
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,516
You look like you need a ride.

440
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,313
Um...

441
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,036
Actually, I'm OK.

442
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,154
Don't look it.

443
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,039
Come on. I don't bite.

444
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,679
Blue thermos is coffee,
red's whiskey.

445
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,233
Help yourself.

446
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,191
I'm OK, thanks.

447
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,754
Where you headed?

448
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,033
Just as close as you can get
to Port Mary would be great.

449
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,954
Checking my feed for danger signs?

450
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,753
I get it a lot.

451
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,111
1.4. Gotta be an antisocial
maniac, right?

452
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,354
You seem...
- Normal?

453
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,710
Yeah.
- Thank you.

454
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,753
It took some effort.

455
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,832
What happened to you?

456
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,559
I mean, you're a 2.8,
but you don't look 2.8.

457
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,238
That's not... This is temporary.

458
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,430
I'm gonna turn it around.

459
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,153
I'm going to a wedding.

460
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,634
Maid of honour.
- Nice.

461
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,353
Want to hear my speech?

462
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,275
No.

463
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,831
So how come you're two-eight?

464
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,154
Well...

465
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,596
Got marked down
at the airport for yelling

466
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,631
and they put me on double damage.

467
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,634
How did it feel?

468
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,589
Awful.

469
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,839
I meant the yelling.

470
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,596
I don't know. I was mad.

471
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,791
Look at where it got me.

472
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,829
But as long as I get to
the wedding, do the speech

473
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,234
they'll overlook the two-eight.

474
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,271
I'm with the bride
and if I do well

475
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,709
well, they're all high fours
so that velocitates my arc.

476
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,515
And once they lift the point penalty,
well, then my average goes way up

477
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,200
and, yeah, it's gonna be OK.

478
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,476
God, you remind me of me.

479
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,116
Not now.

480
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,520
I was, 4.6 once.

481
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,994
Four-six?
- Used to live for it.

482
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,669
All the work I put in...

483
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,195
Eight years ago, Tom,
my husband, got cancer.

484
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,629
It was pancreatic.
It was a real bitch.

485
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,433
The symptoms showed up late.

486
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,599
I'm so sorry.

487
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,429
You don't know me
so you're not really sorry.

488
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,153
You're just...
you're mainly awkward

489
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,760
'cause I have sprung some
cancer talk at you.

490
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,229
Anyway, I five-starred
every doctor

491
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,831
every nurse, every high-four
consultant that we had.

492
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,598
Ding. Ding. Ding.
Thank you so much.

493
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,598
And the cancer didn't give a shit.
It just kept growing.

494
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,440
A couple of months in, we heard
about this experimental treatment.

495
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,235
It was very expensive.
It was very exclusive.

496
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,234
I did everything I could to
get him a spot there.

497
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,553
Tom was a 4.3.

498
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,110
They gave his bed to a 4.4.

499
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,399
So when he died I thought,
fuck it.

500
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,959
I started saying what I wanted,
when I wanted.

501
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,434
Just drop it out there.

502
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,039
People don't always like that.

503
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,391
It is incredible how fast
you slip off the ladder

504
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,113
when you start doing that.

505
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,518
It turned out a lot of my friends
didn't care for honesty.

506
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,032
Treated me like I had taken
a shit at their breakfast table.

507
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,630
But, Jesus Christ, it felt good.

508
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,631
Shedding those fuckers.

509
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,200
It was like taking off tight shoes.

510
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,952
- Maybe you should try it?
- Come on.

511
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,399
Why not?

512
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,196
I can't just kick off my shoes
and walk the earth or whatever.

513
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,153
- You won't know unless you try.
- That's just...

514
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,992
Look, you had something
with your life.

515
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,792
Real things, good things.

516
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,674
And you lost it all,
and I'm sorry.

517
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,351
So now you've got
nothing left to lose.

518
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,313
But I don't even have the
something worth losing, not yet.

519
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,671
You know, I mean,
I'm still fighting for that.

520
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,437
And what is 'that'?

521
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,871
I don't know.
Enough to be content?

522
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,120
Like, to look around and think,
'Well, I guess I'm OK.'

523
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,916
Just to be able to breathe out,
not feeling like... like...

524
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,429
Like just...

525
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,280
And that is way off,
like, way, way off.

526
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,199
And until I get there,
I have to play the numbers game.

527
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,557
You know, we all do,
that's what we're in.

528
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,671
That's how the fucking world works.

529
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,676
Look, maybe you don't remember.

530
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,075
You know,
you're just too old to get it.

531
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,151
I do not mean that how it sounds.

532
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,153
Don't worry.
I'm not voting you down.

533
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,791
Sweetheart.

534
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,399
What time is it?

535
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,874
I'm heading east from here

536
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,639
so I think you need to get yourself
another ride.

537
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,798
Where are we?
- About 30 miles from Port Mary.

538
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,117
A lot of buses stop here
so you should be fine.

539
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,471
Well, thank you.
- Good luck with your speech.

540
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,719
I put a little something
in there for you.

541
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,037
You did?
- Emergency escape hatch!

542
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,795
Bye.

543
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,711
In this world,
we're all so caught up

544
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,990
in our own dramas.

545
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,919
So, Dad was like...
- It's easy to forget what matters.

546
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,553
Like, he'd never even
heard of the show.

547
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,955
I'm like, 'You never heard of
Sea of Tranquillity?'

548
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,389
Like, the number-one
sci-fi fantasy

549
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,909
and he's all like, 'What the fuck?'
- Whatever!

550
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,792
I think I'm allergic to this purple.

551
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,117
So I'm like, "Well, I'm going
to Tranquillity Con in Port Mary.

552
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,515
That's why I'm dressed like
Lieutenant Duster.'

553
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,951
He's all like, 'Port Mary
is frickin' miles away.'

554
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,832
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

555
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,555
He one-stars me.
Like, thanks, Dad.

556
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,069
- See you back on there.
- OK.

557
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,714
Are you guys headed
to Tranquillity Con?

558
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,832
You're into Sea of Tranquillity?
- Totally.

559
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,314
I was all set to go.

560
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,670
My friend, who is there already,
has my costume

561
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:17,236
but my car broke down.

562
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,753
Well, there's some space
in the RV.

563
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,557
- Hey!

564
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,716
- You're a Trank Head?
- Sorry?

565
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,956
Trank Head.
Sea of Tranquillity fan?

566
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,675
Yeah.
We say Tranksters where I'm from.

567
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,755
Who's your favourite character?

568
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,314
Gotta be Lieutenant Duster.

569
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,192
She's awesome.
- She?

570
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,436
He! I misspoke.

571
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,199
Lieutenant Duster
has no fixed gender.

572
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,230
I know.

573
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,590
And that's why it's
so hard to remember, right?

574
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,756
Excuse me. Gotta get this.

575
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,235
My friend at the convention.

576
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,557
Hi, Nay!

577
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,834
So, my God, insane night,
but I am so close now.

578
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,030
- Don't come.
- What?

579
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,311
No, no...
I'm, like, an hour away.

580
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,317
Don't come.
I don't want you here.

581
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,794
I don't know what is up with you

582
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,877
but I cannot have
a two-six at my wedding.

583
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,197
No, that's temporary!
That's temporary.

584
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,470
Well, the wedding's today, so...

585
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,034
But it doesn't change anything.
- Lacie...

586
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,276
I can still do the same speech.
- Lacie...

587
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,516
And there's... Mr Rags!

588
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,190
- No!
- But... but you invited me.

589
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,039
You've seen the guest list.
They are all, like, four-five or above.

590
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,037
They are going to freak at a two-six

591
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,593
and I am not taking
that kind of damage.

592
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,234
Plus, I haven't dipped under
a four-seven in, like, six months.

593
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,076
You said you wanted
your oldest friend.

594
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,317
When I asked you to speak,
you were a four-two, OK?

595
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,716
And the authenticity of a vintage bond
low four at a gathering of this calibre

596
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,593
played fantastically on all
the stimulations we ran.

597
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,029
Forecast was a prestige
bounce of .2 minimum.

598
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,436
But now you're a sub three.
Sorry.

599
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,517
But that just puts the stink on
things a little too much.

600
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,597
That just plays badly for us.

601
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,029
So it was just about
numbers for you?

602
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,232
Cut the shit!
It was numbers for both of us.

603
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,271
You wanted those
primo votes, don't deny it.

604
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,879
I mean, it's not like you could
get them on your own.

605
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,274
Let's not kid ourselves.

606
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,675
I'm... I'm getting those votes.

607
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,031
What? You're just gonna roll up here
and make people like you?

608
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,391
That's right. I'm doing
my speech.

609
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,714
No, you're not!

610
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,114
Yes, I am.

611
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,198
And they are gonna vote me
through the roof when they hear it.

612
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,914
Weep their fucking eyes out!

613
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,270
Go home!

614
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,278
Hello?

615
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,400
Fuck!

616
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,519
I have never seen
your stupid fucking show.

617
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,836
Hope they cancel it!

618
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,640
I need a ride!

619
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,556
I'll kick your ass!

620
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,915
Fuck!

621
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,914
Jesus.

622
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,310
Hey! Hey!

623
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,955
Hey!

624
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,191
Borrow your bike?
- What?

625
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,392
Can I borrow your bike?

626
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,389
Do you, Naomi Jayne Blestow,
take this man to be your husband

627
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,239
to live together with him
in the covenant of marriage?

628
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,193
To love him, comfort him

629
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:05,029
honour and keep him,
in sickness and in health

630
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,596
and forsaking all others,
be faithful unto him...

631
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,398
To my best man, Anthony.
Let's hear it for him.

632
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,473
You've been there from day one.

633
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,431
I love you, man.
I appreciate you.

634
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,198
Hilarious speech,
by the way.

635
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,030
By your standards.

636
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,677
He's still got two bullets left.

637
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,994
Man.

638
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,634
Gosh, well, um...
You know, I..,

639
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,193
Shit!

640
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:44,317
We have so many people to thank.
Our beautiful bridesmaids.

641
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,634
But, of course

642
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,993
my most heartfelt thanks,
my warmest thanks

643
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,919
are to someone who's
my best friend...

644
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,913
my lover and now

645
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,113
I'm honoured to say,
my wife...

646
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,231
Naomi!

647
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,189
Let's cheers Naomi!

648
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,119
One, two, three! Naomi!

649
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,756
The A Team!

650
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,876
I love you so much, doll!
- Woo, woo, woo, woo!

651
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,399
Congratulations, sir!

652
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,272
Thank you.
- No, thank you.

653
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,675
Woo! Get over here!
- Nailed it!

654
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,755
Get your ass over here.
- Yeah!

655
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,916
Fuckin' get in here, big boy.
- Yeah!

656
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,951
You're beautiful!

657
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,469
Yeah, gimme a hug!

658
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,558
Yeah! Dude, off the charts!

659
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,319
You fucking earned it, man.
You fucking earned this.

660
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,759
Hello!

661
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,079
Everybody, hello!

662
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,430
- My God.
- Love you.

663
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,149
Can everyone be quiet
for a moment?

664
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,078
Thank you.

665
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,396
Get rid of her.
- That would play awful.

666
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,794
She's a fucking one-one.

667
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,719
Now, for those of you
who don't know me

668
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,036
which is all... all of you...

669
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,233
my name is Lacie Pound

670
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,989
and, believe it or not,
I am one of Naomi's oldest friends.

671
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,711
Hi, Nay-Nay!

672
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,118
It's great to meet you too, Paul.
I've heard a lot about you.

673
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,197
He's a pretty big deal, that Paul.

674
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,595
Pretty big deal.

675
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,349
He makes his own tapenade.
Yeah.

676
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,154
Anyway, um... I...

677
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,954
have looked up to Naomi
pretty much my entire life.

678
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,718
We met when we were
five years old

679
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,558
and right up through to
our teenage years.

680
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,513
We made quite the pair.

681
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,116
We'd talk about
all the things girls talk about.

682
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,472
You know, boys, hair, products.

683
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,670
More boys.

684
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,395
I mean, I tried sometimes to expand
our range a little

685
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,556
and talk about, I don't know,
climate change

686
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,955
but she found that kind of boring,

687
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,954
Go.

688
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,833
She was probably right.
I mean, fuck the planet, right?

689
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,029
Whoo!

690
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,870
Yes, thank you!
Come on. Let's have a little fun here.

691
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,752
You know, fuck the planet.

692
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,471
No, fuck the planet!

693
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,759
OK.

694
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,831
Anyway...

695
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:37,911
I... looked up to Naomi
pretty much my entire life

696
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:43,239
which meant she was...
looking down on me.

697
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,958
Always with a smile, though.

698
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,631
In high school,
she was my shoulder to cry on.

699
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,751
She seemed to enjoy that.

700
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,077
Guys and me never worked out.

701
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,238
They'd see Naomi and just...
Whoop!

702
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,759
You know, that was it.

703
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:08,232
She had this tight ass

704
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,671
like two fists.

705
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,960
I was all like...

706
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,389
Blurgh...

707
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,674
I was like...
Blurgh...

708
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,313
Through the hallways in high school.

709
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,033
Blurgh...

710
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,479
And she was there for me.

711
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,758
Holding my hair back...

712
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,720
as I knelt, vomiting...

713
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,238
in front of the crapper.

714
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,356
Thank you for that, Naomi.

715
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,557
I always wished I was you.

716
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,515
And...

717
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,558
I guess that's why you kept me
around so long?

718
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,318
Until you got your new job

719
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:26,275
and your fancy new friends.

720
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,870
And that...

721
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,759
...fucking... jackhole!

722
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,199
And you didn't need me.

723
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,197
You probably got another me.

724
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,713
Guess there's some other 'BFF'
you moved on to like a succubus.

725
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,354
'M getting to Mr Rags, OK?
Jesus!

726
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,309
Stay back.

727
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,555
Fuck.

728
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,558
Stay the fuck back! I'll kill him!

729
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,194
I'll cut his head off
and stick it up my ass!

730
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,549
Time's nearly up!

731
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,795
Hey! Calm down.

732
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,638
I just wanted to say,
in this...

733
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,593
we're all so caught up
in our own shit

734
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,031
let's not forget what matters.
- It's OK. It's OK.

735
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:20,035
Happiness, fucking Paul and Naomi,
and she's...

736
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,195
She...

737
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,353
She fucked Greg!

738
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,872
I know she did!

739
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,078
I know you did.
- It's not...

740
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,760
Don't even try to deny...

741
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:42,038
The little girl who, when we
were just five years old in art camp,

742
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:46,278
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared

743
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,960
and helped me make Mr Rags.

744
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:54,390
He reminds me of you
and what you meant to me then!

745
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:58,434
And I'm so honoured to be here
to see this shit!

746
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,720
I love you, Nay-Nay!

747
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,195
I've always loved you!

748
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,436
I love you!

749
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,678
What the fuck are you
looking at?

750
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,798
Just what I was wondering.

751
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,480
Well...

752
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,949
Don't!

753
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,670
Don't?

754
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,719
Don't wonder?

755
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,596
It'd be a dull world
without wonder.

756
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,314
I don't give a shit about your world.

757
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,032
I don't like your brassiere.

758
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,358
I don't like your moustache.

759
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,834
I don't like your aura.

760
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,357
My aura?
- Yeah.

761
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,476
I don't like your...

762
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,635
head.

763
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,069
Your entire head is just
ridiculous to me.

764
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,315
Really?

765
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:40,197
You look like an alcoholic
former weatherman.

766
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,959
You sound like a lost little lamb

767
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,310
that just got told
there's no Santa Claus.

768
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,319
What sort of cartoon character
did your mum have to fuck

769
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,953
to brew you up in the womb?

770
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,798
At least I look like I was born

771
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:57,277
not shit out by some tormented cow
creature in an underground lab.

772
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,038
You got tossed out of that lab.

773
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,674
- Yeah?
- Yeah, flushed out.

774
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,599
Ooh!
- In the trash!

775
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,190
Your face is a fuckin'...
- A fuckin'...

776
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,236
A fuckin'...
biological car crash

777
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,237
that made Picasso screw
his eyes up and say

778
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,793
'Well, that just don't make sense.'

779
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,234
You're a fucking asshole.
- Fuck you!

780
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,999
Fuck you next Wednesday!
- Fuck you for Christmas!

781
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,235
Fuck...
- Fuck...

782
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,035
...you!
- ...you!
