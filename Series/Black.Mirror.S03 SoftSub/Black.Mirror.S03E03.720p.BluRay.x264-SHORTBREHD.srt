1
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,795
Kenny? Big spillage on table four.
Sorry.

2
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,398
OK. Alright.

3
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,874
Excuse me.

4
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,554
Someone forgot this.

5
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,954
Thank you!

6
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,037
What do you say?
- Thank you.

7
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,118
It's alright.
- She forgets everything. Thanks again.

8
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,035
She was some yoga teacher, bruv,
proper bendy.

9
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,593
Look. Look.

10
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,915
Jesus! Fuck!

11
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,352
What, she sent that to you,
did she?

12
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,720
Double naughty.

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,831
Jog on.

14
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,036
Linds!

15
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,033
Linds, where's my laptop?

16
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,036
- Don't be a bell end!
- Use your own.

17
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,594
Mine's bust.
And yours has gone all frozen anyway.

18
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,710
What did you do?

19
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,876
I was trying to put on this film thing.
- What film thing?

20
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,878
Dunno. Some programme lets
you watch free films.

21
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,116
While I was trying to put it on,
then it locked up.

22
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,630
Look, it's not my fault.
- Don't take it again. It's not yours.

23
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,911
- Fix mine when you've done that.
- 'Fix mine when you've done that.'

24
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,357
- Stop nicking my Cokes!
- Whatever.

25
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,679
Did you draw that yourself,
Kenny?

26
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,477
Thanks, Kenny. See you tomorrow.

27
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,915
Bye.

28
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,713
Bye, Kenny.
- Bye, Kenny, I'll see you tomorrow.

29
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,474
You're mental.

30
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,909
You're mental.
- You're a thief.

31
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,835
Love?

32
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,033
Kenny? What do you think?

33
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,510
I'm still not used to the colour.
- It's nice.

34
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,675
Yeah?

35
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,995
Do me a favour and prison-guard
your sister, will you?

36
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,633
I won't be late. Probably.

37
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,675
My God! He's outside.

38
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,996
Erm, there's a lasagne thing
in the freezer.

39
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,839
I love you.

You OK, Ken?

48
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,076
Love?

49
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,795
Yeah, fine.

50
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,679
Ha!

51
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,634
Morning, Kenny.
- Hi.

52
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,273
Kenny?
- Feeling really sick.

53
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,359
You've only just got here.
- I know but think I might throw up.

54
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,393
OK, just next time can you...?

55
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,360
Whoa!
Easy, knobber.

56
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,470
Come on.

57
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,230
It's fragile.

58
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,476
What is it?

59
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,554
They told me to do that.

60
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,550
Is that it?

61
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,389
What do I do now?

62
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,079
I can't really help you.

63
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,719
What do I have to do?

64
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,795
Just whatever they say.

65
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,558
And once you've done that,
you're out.

66
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,319
They let you off.

67
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,115
Hello?

68
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,238
Del... delivery.

69
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,350
Wrong room.

70
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,039
They said 121.

71
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,511
No, there's no delivery here.

72
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,349
But they said 1...
- I haven't ordered anything.

73
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,029
It's a cake.

74
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,395
What cake?

75
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,590
I don't know.
I think it's a sponge.

76
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,871
I didn't order a cake so just take
it back to the bakery land

77
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,831
and tell them they got it wrong.
- Look, if I...

78
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,113
I don't want the cake.
So go away or I call the front desk.

79
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,160
I will kick that cake
up your fucking arse.

80
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,998
Min... Mindy sent me.

81
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,477
What is this?
Where's Mindy?

82
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,033
I was just told to give this to you.

83
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,034
Mindy told you?
- No.

84
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,589
You said 'Mindy.'

85
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,517
That's what they told me to say.

86
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,955
Get inside.

87
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,275
So what are you saying?
Are you saying Mindy ordered the cake?

88
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,951
Erm, no, I don't know.
It... they... it was them.

89
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,991
Them? They?
Who the fuck are you on about?

90
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,111
The... the people.
- What fucking people?

91
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,870
The phone people.
The people on the phone.

92
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,390
They told me to bring the cake
and they're leaving texts on my phone

93
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,000
and then I do what they say.
- Whoa, whoa. Slow down.

94
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,758
Just breathe through your nose.

95
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,436
Through your nose. OK?

96
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,669
Good.

97
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,552
Now, just show me what
they said.

98
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,273
On your phone.

99
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,954
Show me the text.
- OK, well, erm... This...

100
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,639
I should...
- Shut up. Just let me.

101
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,429
What the fuck is this?

102
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,712
Who are these people?
- I don't know.

103
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,195
Who are you?

104
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,035
I'm not them.

105
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,359
They send me messages
and I do what they say.

106
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,514
Why?
Why would you do that?

107
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,029
Is it them?

108
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,350
They said I had to do that.
- Jesus Christ!

109
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,395
They're saying they just need us
to follow their instructions

110
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,556
and everything will be OK.
OK?

111
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,549
Shit!

112
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,400
They're saying we have
to do it together.

113
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,071
What do we have to do?
- Just take the cake somewhere.

114
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,911
They sent me an address.
A map coordinate thing.

115
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,590
And there's a car we need to get.
- A car? What sort of car?

116
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,632
I don't know what sort of car.

117
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,512
They said it's in
the carpark outside.

118
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,517
They sent me a licence plate.
That's all I know.

119
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,200
Why both of us?

120
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,199
I don't know!

121
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,875
Just let me deal with my
fucking shoe, please.

122
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,118
What are they saying?

123
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,112
They say, 'Go with him.
Take the package.'

124
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,869
OK.

125
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,591
<i>Right. 'V760 DHM.!</i>

126
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,232
I'm getting fucking
number blindness here.

127
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,509
That's it.

128
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,953
Alright. They said the keys
were on the back.

129
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,431
OK.

130
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,395
Look, maybe you better drive.
Do you drive?

131
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,717
I mean, I had a drink back there.
-I can't. I can, I can drive.

132
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,034
I'm still learning.
I haven't passed my test yet.

133
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,550
Alright.
You're navigating.

134
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,078
OK, you've got a sat nav
on your phone?

135
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,315
Yep.

136
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,353
Here it is. Punch that in.

137
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,677
It's a street somewhere
out of town.

138
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,154
Sort of High Wycombe-ish.

139
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,431
They said we got to be there by two.
It's gonna be tight.

140
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,719
So I'm guessing
they got some shit on you

141
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,194
that they're threatening
to put out, then?

142
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,000
With me, it's...

143
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,635
You saw the room,
fucking lacy knickers and...

144
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,752
I was waiting for a prostitute.

145
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,430
Escort, hooker,
whatever they call them now.

146
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,676
I got a family, which is great.

147
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,515
You get bored.

148
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,671
I mean, when I was young,
I used to like...

149
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,794
I can't fucking justify it.

150
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,797
I just wanted to fuck a
twenty-something.

151
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,911
For old times' sake, I don't know.

152
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,839
I joined this website.
I was curious.

153
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,553
I just wanted to see
what was on there.

154
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,879
I got talking to Mindy,
who I thought was Mindy.

155
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,996
I mean, she sent me pictures.

156
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,394
I sent some back.

157
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,070
Phone photos.
Grabbing my cock.

158
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,634
You name it.
They got the whole fucking thing.

159
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,512
But not just pictures.
Chat messages.

160
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,437
All the arrangements,
where and when.

161
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,869
Me haggling over the price
and they say they got it all.

162
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,355
Sucked up the whole
hard drive like an audit.

163
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,359
Fucking twat.
What a fucking idiot!

164
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,198
If that shit gets out,
that's my wife out the door.

165
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,072
Then there's the kids,
she'll take them.

166
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,758
No, not a doubt in my mind.

167
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,473
She'd take them and she'd win.

168
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,033
Custody, she'd win.

169
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,710
And I'm not losing my kids.
I tell you that right now.

170
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,354
No way.
Absolutely fucking no!

171
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,717
They filmed me.

172
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,035
Filmed you...?
- Through my computer camera.

173
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,273
What, like, filmed you?
- Yeah, like, you know, doing it.

174
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,835
Like sex?
- No. Like... Fuck.

175
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,029
You know.

176
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,955
Jerking off.

177
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,038
+Jerking off to porn
or something?

178
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,159
Well, everyone does that.

179
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,954
The fucking pope probably does that.

180
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,149
They're gonna put it
everywhere.

181
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,952
Like, they're gonna send it
to everyone.

182
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,832
- Shit the fuck!
- What? What?

183
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,030
How long's that light been on?
- What light?

184
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,909
Whoever's car this is,
they left it fucking empty.

185
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,994
Won't be a minute.

186
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,349
Unleaded. Unleaded.

187
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,469
Bugger!

188
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,555
Listen, you pay, yeah?
It'll save time.

189
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,390
Have you got any money?

190
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,631
OK, Visa card PIN number 3109.
Say that back to me.

191
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,353
- Visa card...
- Just the number!

192
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,789
Er... 3109.
- OK, go!

193
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,235
Pump four!

194
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,271
What's your pump number?
- Four.

195
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,391
Want some chocolate?
- No.

196
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,871
It's two for one this week.
- I'm OK.

197
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,120
£31.89.

198
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,919
Pop your PIN in.

199
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,834
- If you're sure you don't mind.
- No, no, of course not.

200
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,791
I'll... I'll get on to that.

201
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,593
Make some calls.
- Brilliant! It's next Wednesday.

202
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,473
OK.
- Keep it non-dairy just to be safe.

203
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,919
OK.

204
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,519
This is...

205
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,275
my nephew.

206
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,639
Nice to meet you.

207
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,869
Kenny.
- Kenny. I'm Karen.

208
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,316
We're both Ks.

209
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,350
I'm head of the PTA at Theo and
Cassie's school, for my sins.

210
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,199
Just roped poor Hector
into sorting out the catering

211
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,833
for the quiz night.

212
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,279
Been the usual balls up.

213
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,630
Listen, we better get this
guy to the station.

214
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,320
His train's...
So we better go.

215
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,034
Cansroad Station?
- Yeah.

216
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,310
You couldn't drop me at
the end of my road, could you?

217
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,794
It's on the way. Mayer Street?

218
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,236
It's the bus otherwise and that goes
all the way around the common.

219
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,671
- We're in a bit of a rush, actually.
- It's no detour. It's en route.

220
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,270
I'll hop out. Hardly need
to slow down. Yeah?

221
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,958
Yep. Sure. Let's go.
- Brilliant. Thanks!

222
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,033
I'll just get in the back.

223
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,553
Don't want to squash
your box.

224
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,991
What's that? Present?
- It's a cake.

225
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,954
- It's just a... it's a cake for Penny.
- Lucky her.

226
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,879
So how is Penny?

227
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,072
Haven't seen her since...
must have been sports day.

228
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,115
She's good.

229
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,039
She still planning to get
back to work?

230
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,878
Yeah. Yep.

231
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,718
I mean, how old's Theo now?

232
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,671
He's seven.

233
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,550
He was so funny in the play.
That big top hat on.

234
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,717
Yeah, he had a good time.

235
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,595
Anna's having a sleepover.

236
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,551
Cassie's probably already
told you about it.

237
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,953
Six nine-year-olds in the house.
I must be mad.

238
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,834
So, Kenny, where you
heading back to?

239
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,959
Sorry, what?
- Are you going home or...?

240
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,750
Train. Birmingham.

241
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,197
Yeah. Erm, yeah...

242
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,835
- I-1 live in Birmingham.
- My husband's from Birmingham.

243
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,712
What part are you?
- Er, south.

244
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,273
South?

245
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,554
Mainly.
- Right.

246
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,316
Have you always lived there?
'Cause you don't sound...

247
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,715
I don't have the accent, no.
Erm, everyone says that...

248
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,434
That... I don't have the accent.

249
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,318
Didn't grow up there, though, that's...
I grew up somewhere else.

250
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,195
Like London. I grew up in London.

251
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,311
OK.

252
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,638
And is your mum and dad
on Hector's side or Penny's?

253
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,119
Someone crossing! Crossing!

254
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,230
Sorry about that.

255
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,319
Can't miss his train.

256
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,875
Er, this is me.

257
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,719
Great to meet you, Kenny.
Give my best to Penny, won't you?

258
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,274
Yes, of course.
- Bye, then.

259
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,072
Bye, Karen.
- Bye.

260
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,479
We're gonna make it, OK?

261
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,150
It's this junction.

262
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,797
What? This one?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

263
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,433
You sure this is it?

264
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,600
'Look in the cake.'

265
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,359
Let's look in the cake.

266
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,874
Look in the cake.

267
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,791
In the cake, I suppose.

268
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,040
I got something.

269
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,755
What the fuck?

270
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,079
My God.

271
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,797
'Five minutes to decide.'

272
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,638
Decide what?

273
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,033
'Who is driver?'
- 'Who is robber?'

274
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,192
W-w-we can't. We...
- I'm driver.

275
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,437
You said you can't drive.
I'm driver.

276
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,230
I'll be right here
with the engine running.

277
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,951
We... We can't. We...

278
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,150
Then how else are we gonna
deal with this, Kenny?

279
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,634
I'm not...
- Listen to me.

280
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,751
- I'm not...
- Shut up and listen!

281
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,990
Hat and sunglasses.

282
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,314
No one's going to ID you.

283
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,237
You could be Kevin fucking Bacon.
That's point one.

284
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,873
What are you...?
- Shut up!

285
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,515
Point two, in a robbery,
staff are trained...

286
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,550
I am not...

287
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,069
They are trained to hand
over the cash.

288
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,270
No argument.
I saw it in a documentary.

289
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,880
No resistance. It looked easy.
- It's not easy.

290
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,356
I know it isn't easy,
but what the fuck else are we gonna do?

291
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,315
Hey?

292
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,833
This gets out,
I will lose my kids.

293
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,873
And I swear to God,
I will stand in the kitchen

294
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,072
and put a fucking bread knife
through my throat if that happens.

295
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,671
I only... only looked at pictures and...
- And beat one off on camera?

296
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,633
That's what they got, yeah?

297
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,472
Your hot little face,
blurred fist

298
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,557
dick burping fucking spunk
everywhere?

299
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,795
Your mum's gonna love that on
Facebook, Twitter

300
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,194
Insta-fucking-whatever.

301
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,359
And her friends.
All eyes on you, giving it that.

302
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,393
Toss in the cunts at work,
calling you Spurty McGoo.

303
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,353
Laughing at your come face,
making it their desktop wallpaper.

304
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,357
It's not just weeks.
We're talking years here.

305
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,119
Like pictures hang about on Google
like a gypsy fucking curse.

306
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,595
There's no cure for the Internet.
It would never go away.

307
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,553
It would be glued to your name,
a fucking stain on you.

308
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,793
I'd hang myself if that was me.

309
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,275
Crack my fucking neck at
the first opportunity.

310
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,399
They just want the money.

311
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,719
So go in there and do it.

312
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,469
You'll drive away.
- I am not gonna drive away.

313
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,875
I'm gonna be sat here
with the engine running.

314
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,079
I can't. I can't.

315
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,873
You can. You can.
-I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't.

316
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,194
You can.
- I can't.

317
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,197
We don't have much time,
Kenny.

318
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,391
It's not real. This is not real.
- You can do this.

319
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,558
Keep it together.
Please hold it together.

320
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,193
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!

321
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,114
OK.

322
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,230
Have you got a bag?

323
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,436
Glasses.

324
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,030
Breathe through your nose.

325
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,031
Give me money.

326
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,477
Just give me money!

327
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,072
Yes. OK.
- Lots of it.

328
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,397
I need lots of it.

329
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,511
Sh-should I use your bag?

330
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,439
Take it.

331
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,155
Erm...

332
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,276
I'm going... I'm going to pass
this back to you now.

333
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,833
Is that OK?

334
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,918
There was some bloke standing
there on his phone freaking me out.

335
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,678
Did you get it?
- Yeah.

336
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,359
Go faster!

337
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,879
The speed limit's 40.

338
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,831
You wanna get stopped
for speeding now?

339
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,236
- Shit.
- Fuck!

340
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,990
That's a siren.

341
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,680
Shh! Shush.

342
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,152
Let's go!
- Shut up.

343
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,239
Wait, wait.

344
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,715
Come on.

345
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,319
Come on.

346
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,634
OK.

347
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,793
We're OK.

348
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,831
We should text them, no?

349
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,791
Tell them we got the money.

350
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,234
They say we got to take it somewhere.
- Where?

351
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,069
This is it.

352
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,434
Yeah.

353
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,879
Here we go.

354
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,714
'Final instruction.'

355
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,753
'Take car away and destroy.'

356
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,757
Destroy the car.

357
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,279
'Just you alone.'

358
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,396
Why just you?

359
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,796
I've got to take the money
somewhere over there.

360
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,517
Why?
Why have I got to do it?

361
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,391
Fuck knows.

362
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,473
So...

363
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,113
You better go, yeah?

364
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,754
Hey, you got this far,
haven't you?

365
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,429
Just drop it off. That's it.

366
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,078
You'll be alright.

367
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,190
Hey, listen, Kenny.

368
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,439
Look. I'm sorry about...

369
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,355
just back there.

370
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,960
Shouting at you.
Calling you stuff.

371
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,356
I'm an alright bloke, really.
I swear I am.

372
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,149
When it's...

373
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,278
When stuff's normal.

374
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,393
You take care, yeah?

375
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,833
Yeah, yeah.
Hang on, hang on.

376
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,236
They told me I had
to set this thing off first.

377
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,720
OK.

378
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,640
You got the prize money?

379
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,549
Prize money?
- You know, for the... fight?

380
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,998
How is there a fight?

381
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,310
They didn't tell you?
- No.

382
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,753
We've got to fight...

383
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,390
...or else they post
everything they've got on us.

384
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,077
Winner takes the money.

385
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,479
We've got to do it.

386
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,955
I mean...

387
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,473
They're watching.

388
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,635
What sort of fight?

389
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,677
How do we know when it's over?

390
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,032
How... how do we know
who's won?

391
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,713
I don't know about you,
but...

392
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,479
my life's over

393
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,158
if this gets out.

394
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,034
Fucking over.

395
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,999
What'd they get you for?

396
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,111
I just looked at some photos.
That's all.

397
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,595
I just looked at one
or two photos.

398
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,994
Yeah.

399
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,639
Yeah, yeah, I just looked
at pictures, too.

400
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,032
How young were they?
In the pictures?

401
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,079
How young?

402
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,318
Yeah.

403
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,679
Well, me too.

404
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,839
Whoa...

405
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,599
Hey, mate. Don', please.

406
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,392
Please.
