1
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,674
They're ready now.

2
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,473
Perhaps we could begin
with your earliest recollections

3
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,670
of the events of last May.

4
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,910
Well, I first got involved on the 15th.

5
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,837
Could you move
the microphone a little closer?

6
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,395
Here?

7
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,472
I first got involved on the 15th.

8
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,831
Chancellor Tom Pickering has defended

9
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,394
the government's stance
on disability benefits

10
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,469
as outrage over the death of so-called
'Wheelchair Martyr' Gwen Marbury grows.

11
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,556
More than 20,000 people
have signed a petition

12
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,480
demanding the sacking
of newspaper columnist Jo Powers

13
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,433
following her controversial article
about Gwen Marbury.

14
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,835
Conservationists have announced
another extinction.

15
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,632
The Siberian crane has died out

16
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,230
following an unprecedented reduction
in its wetland habitat.

17
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,478
And the honeybee-mimicking drone insects
known as ADIs

18
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,353
have been activated
for their second summer.

19
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,678
Hope you're ashamed of yourself.

20
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,830
Bitch.
- Pleasure's all mine.

21
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,754
Yo Powers?

22
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,039
Jo Powers.

23
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,112
Whatever's in there, will it detonate?

24
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,551
That's from bakery. For you.

25
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,233
Thank you.
- Thank you.

26
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,235
Hello, darling!

27
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,869
Creative, your well-wishers.

28
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,718
Don't eat it.

29
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,354
It's a cake. That's its job.

30
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,873
I'm going to have a bath.

31
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,751

Ha!

38
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,831
Grammy Award-winning
rapper Tusk is still with us.

39
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,235
Now, Tusk,
there are loads of online videos

40
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,679
of people trying to emulate you

41
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,076
but this is our favourite.
Take a look at this.

42
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,837
It's a young chap called Aaron Sheen.
He's nine years old.

43
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,315
Ha! That is one goofy-looking kid.

44
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,351
Not a good dancer.

45
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,791
He's nine years old! I mean, come on,
he's a pretty good dancer...

46
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,160
That little motherfucker can't dance
for shit.

47
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,151
He should probably just give up
now, actually.

48
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,077
- Tusk...
- Don't hate on me for keeping it real.

49
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,760
That's a goofy little motherfucker,
and he can't dance for shit.

50
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,916
He is a big fan, Tusk.

51
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,997
Don't hate on your boy
for keeping it real.

52
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,434
Well, everybody's got
to start somewhere.

53
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,232
Start somewhere?
I looked better than that...

54
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,159
DCI Parke?
- No press.

55
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,235
No, I'm not press.

56
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,069
I'm TDC Blue Colson.
I'm your shadow.

57
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,635
My shadow? They said...

58
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,752
Sorry. Call me Karin.

59
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,232
Did you say your name was...?
- Blue.

60
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,272
B-L-U-E, Blue?
- Yeah. It's not a nickname.

61
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,880
My dad liked the sound of it.

62
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,956
Seen a body before?
- A couple.

63
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,036
On video, I mean.
- Boss?

64
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,951
This is Blue. She's my shadow.

65
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,640
DS Nick Shelton.
- What've we got?

66
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,159
Jo Powers.
- As in...?

67
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,032
As in actual Jo Powers.

68
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,076
Saw something she wrote the other day
about the wheelchair woman.

69
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,589
Clickbait piece.
Pissed people off.

70
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,920
That article was fucking horrendous.
Even I signed the petition.

71
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,919
To get her sacked.

72
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,113
Come on.

73
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,599
Neighbours heard her screaming,
called it in.

74
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,118
Hell of a struggle.

75
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,074
Anyone else at home?

76
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,638
Husband.
Found slashed across the stomach.

77
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,833
By her?
- Dunno.

78
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,952
He was unconscious.
They've taken him to St Columbus.

79
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,273
Her mentions are still pouring in.

80
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,671
Restraining bolt's in place.

81
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,474
No other points of entry?

82
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,478
No. But the outside's
ringed with CCTV.

83
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,875
We got the code for the cams?

84
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,510
OK, then.

85
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,514
Check the recordings.
Bag that, send it to Toxicology.

86
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,951
Full autop for her, and we question the
husband as soon as he wakes up.

87
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,040
Come on.

88
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,752
You think it's the husband?
- I'm keeping options open.

89
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,589
Cutting the throat, that's unusual.
Thanks, chaps.

90
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,914
But you do think he did it?

91
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,159
Don't know anything yet.

92
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,395
These things are almost always
either drink, drugs or domestic.

93
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,919
It is how it is.

94
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,391
You driving home?
- No licence. Never passed.

95
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,750
I'm sort of waiting for driverless
to go mainstream.

96
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,393
Get in.
- No, honestly, I'll get the tube.

97
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,796
- Get in.
- OK.

98
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,674
So you were in Tech Crime?

99
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,556
Digital Forensics. Computer murk.

100
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,550
What happened?
You get bored of it?

101
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,477
Er, not exactly.

102
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,909
Um, you've seen what people
tuck away on these.

103
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,033
Schemes and kill lists, kiddie porn.
It's not boring.

104
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,435
I'm old enough to remember when
they walked around with that stuff

105
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,835
just tucked away in their heads.

106
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,272
Right. But now they can't help but
entrusting it to their little companions.

107
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,119
These things absorb who we are.

108
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,151
They know everything about us.

109
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,675
If it's interesting,
why leave Forensics?

110
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,960
The Rannoch case.

111
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,719
Ian Rannoch?
- The child killings, yeah.

112
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,555
I was the one who cracked
his souvenir folder.

113
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,793
So you saw those pictures?

114
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,638
And the videos, too.
Saw them all.

115
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,039
You see something like that,
it changes you.

116
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,313
You either get defeated or you think...

117
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,273
You think, 'Fuck me.
I've got to help stop that shit.'

118
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,910
Yeah.

119
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,919
I mean, out here in the field...
- What fucking field?

120
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,275
Well, you know what I mean.

121
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,596
Out here in the...
in the real world

122
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,030
you can genuinely prevent stuff,
can't you?

123
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,519
You are young.

124
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,439
Maybe you're old.

125
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,834
Steady.

126
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,753
Thanks.

127
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,749
See you tomorrow.
- Yes, boss.

128
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,870
Jo Powers has been found
dead at her home in West London.

129
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,151
The veteran columnist had been
at the centre of controversy

130
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,956
over an article she'd written about
disability rights activist Gwen Marbury.

131
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,150
The police have yet to confirm the cause...

132
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,194
It's just the first floor,
first door on the...

133
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,036
Starting early?
- I asked Nick to show me the CCTV.

134
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,957
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

135
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,029
So no one came in or out.
Just Jo and her husband all evening.

136
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,198
And that one there?
- Rear patio.

137
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,312
Bust for months by the looks of it.
- Someone could've come in through there.

138
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,560
They'd have to climb the fence,
make it in and out

139
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,874
knowing the camera wasn't working.

140
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,753
But, yeah, could have happened.
Technically.

141
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,638
OK, sorry.

142
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,789
You're keen to help.

143
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,430
She just asked!

144
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,677
Erm... So...

145
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,511
I'm collating every threat or insult
levelled at Jo Powers

146
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,631
over the previous 48 hours.

147
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,313
Say it is the husband.
That's a coincidence, isn't it?

148
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,554
Not really.

149
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,398
You've got everyone
throwing a shit fit.

150
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,193
Stress levels in that household
would've been through the roof.

151
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,240
That Internet stuff
drifts off like weather.

152
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,396
It's half hate.
They don't mean it.

153
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,395
The hate in a marriage,
that's in 3D.

154
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,876
That's had work put into it.
That's sincere.

155
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,478
Yeah. I'm divorced.
-Um...

156
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,636
The husband's up and talking.

157
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,878
You're gonna love his alibi.

158
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,635
She's here.

159
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,556
I heard Jo screaming from upstairs.

160
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,919
And when I ran in,
she was walking...

161
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,278
round the room, stumbling.

162
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,310
She was clutching...

163
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,355
She was clutching her head
as if she was in pain.

164
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,390
And then for a moment,
she stopped.

165
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,837
And then it was like a seizure,
she was...

166
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,880
thrashing and clawing
at her own skin.

167
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,470
And she turned...

168
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,679
She smashed her head...
onto the desk, hard.

169
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,197
Then she... she pushed me over.

170
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,349
That must've been when
the bottle smashed.

171
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,550
And then she...
she picked it up

172
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,557
and she started cutting herself.

173
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,589
Here. She was gouging.

174
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,471
I tried to stop her.

175
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,833
But she did this.

176
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,319
Then she cut her throat.

177
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,553
I tried to stop her.

178
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,989
She cut her own throat
with the glass!

179
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,638
Mutilated and then killed herself
for no apparent reason?

180
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,956
I'd say the odds are against that.

181
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,877
He said it was like
she was having a seizure.

182
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,319
I mean, maybe there was
something in the cake.

183
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,795
The cake?
- It had 'fucking bitch' iced on it.

184
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,751
Could've been something in it.
- Like a drug?

185
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,030
I don't know.
- That makes people kill themselves?

186
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,278
He was sort of convincing.

187
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,273
He just doesn't seem the...
- Don't say 'the type.'

188
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,197
He's ordinary. That is the type.

189
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,197
What, so he bounced her head
off the desk?

190
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,674
Blue.
- Just held her steady enough to cut...?

191
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,199
Blue.
- What?

192
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,710
Toxicology are looking at the cake.
- OK.

193
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,274
Meantime, let's drop in
on the person that sent it.

194
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,400
Got the name this morning.

195
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,959
You don't need to patronise me.

196
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,438
We're doing what you want.

197
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,835
Following another lead.
- That you think is a waste of time.

198
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,551
Picking along dead ends just
to prove they're dead ends

199
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,477
that's most of the job.

200
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,872
I'm not saying it's a waste of time.

201
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,115
Just...

202
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,959
you haven't had a chance
to get bored of reality yet.

203
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,991
OK, that was patronising.

204
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,670
Is this who sent the cake?

205
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,871
Have we checked her social feeds?
- I don't know.

206
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,794
'Death to Jo Powers.'

207
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,556
She posted that
on Monday morning.

208
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,514
The bakery said that, erm,
they're not meant to do obscenities

209
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,190
so I said it was for my sister,
like just a joke thing

210
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,550
and they agreed, so...

211
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,117
Not cheap, their cakes.
With delivery, it was what, 80 quid?

212
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,790
Um...
Well, I didn't pay for it all myself.

213
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,195
We all put a pound in each.
- We?

214
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,550
Yeah, I'm on a mums and carers
message board.

215
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,194
I held a sort of whip-round.

216
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,880
You crowd-sourced the money?
- Yeah, if you like.

217
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,718
From 80 other people?

218
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,758
Look, I'm not...

219
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,834
I'm not being funny, OK?
I know she is dead.

220
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,512
But did you read what
she had written?

221
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,157
Now, how much do you think she got paid
for spouting that horrible shit?

222
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,520
I don't know.

223
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,398
I was just using my freedom of speech.
- To send a threatening message.

224
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,635
Look...

225
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,511
It was funny, OK?

226
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,394
And I can see if I'd done it myself,
then that would be a bit weird

227
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,272
but I'm not mental.

228
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,229
You wished she was dead.

229
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,873
Well...

230
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,877
N-no, no, I didn't.

231
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,029
Here.

232
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,071
'Death to Jo Powers.'

233
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,315
That's just...

234
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,399
It's a... a hashtag game, you know,
like 'Death to...'

235
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,511
You insert the name of someone
who's being an arsehole.

236
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,915
It's not... real.

237
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,553
It's a joke thing.

238
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,557
And who started it? The hashtag?

239
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,270
I don't know. I don't know.
I saw it somewhere.

240
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,075
Excuse us a moment.

241
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,720
Toxicology say the cake's clean.

242
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,352
They also said,
'Thanks, it was delicious.'

243
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,950
We'll give her a caution.
Offensive Communications Act.

244
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,036
Does that cover cakes?
- As far as she's concerned, it does.

245
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,032
What about the others who chipped in?
Are you going to tell them off, too?

246
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,070
I didn't do anything.
- Start a thread about it.

247
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,596
Hospital's discharging the husband
tomorrow.

248
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,119
We'll bring him in for questioning.

249
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,350
Blue.

250
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,556
We're arresting the husband.
Don't wallow in that.

251
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,989
The Internet will be pissed off
with someone else today.

252
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,439
Tusk.

253
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,833
Everyone's pissed off with Tusk
'cause of that thing with the kid.

254
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,555
He's catching a shit storm
on social media.

255
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,840
Liza will be organising the cake now.
- Yeah.

256
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,596
See you tomorrow.
- See ya.

257
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,629
Whoo!

258
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,393
Where my ladies at?

259
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,719
Yo!
-Yo!

260
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,990
Good show tonight, man.
- Yeah, good show, brother.

261
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,439
I'm feeling my shit.
- All day, all day.

262
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,073
Want some of that?
- What you smoking?

263
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,679
Good shit, boy.

264
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,119
<i>Alight.</i>

265
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,189
Damn!

266
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,160
Eyes on, eyes on, eyes on.

267
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,352
Don't stress. It's legal here.

268
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,357
Pfft! Keep forgetting.

269
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,355
Welcome to Europe, I guess.

270
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,640
Kinda takes the joy out of it.
- Tell me about it.

271
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,036
Careful! You break it, you pay for it.

272
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,956
Always doing some bullshit.

273
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,116
Tusk? Tusk?

274
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,631
Yo! Yo!
We need some help over here!

275
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,829
I got you.
- Get it out! Get it out! Get it out!

276
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,834
Call an ambulance!

277
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,232
Commencing.

278
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,837
Did he say what it is?
- Nope.

279
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,632
Good morning.
- Morning.

280
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,634
She's in here.

281
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,434
So l go in

282
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,278
and there's not just the wound
from the glass.

283
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,712
There's a hole. Dug in.
A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel.

284
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,229
So I follow it, you know,
how deep does it go?

285
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,750
It goes all the way from her ear canal
to deep in her brain.

286
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,195
Where I find... this.

287
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,877
Nestled right in there.
Looks quite cosy.

288
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,513
- It's one of those bee things.
- An ADI.

289
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,352
An Autonomous Drone Insect
from the Granular Project.

290
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,913
How did it get in there?
- I'd say it burrowed in.

291
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,475
Fuck me.

292
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,431
That's not the worst part.

293
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,359
It crawled right through her
dorsal posterior insula

294
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,313
which is basically
the brain's pain centre.

295
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,351
You're talking agony off the scale.

296
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,078
You'd do anything to make it stop.

297
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,551
Even cut your own throat.

298
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,636
Good afternoon.
- DCI Parke.

299
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,149
TDC Blue Colson.
- OK. Thank you.

300
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,714
They're so fucking fancy-looking,
these companies.

301
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,639
Billions on branding.
- Well, they can afford it.

302
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,553
The whole ADI project's pretty much
bankrolled by the government.

303
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,557
It's why so many people
are paranoid about it.

304
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,752
Let me guess, this is some people
on the Internet?

305
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,269
They reckon the government
uses the bees to spy on us.

306
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,675
There's a schizophrenic worldview.

307
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,715
Jesus, I didn't expect to find myself
living in the future

308
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,239
but here I fucking well am.

309
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,037
Karin Parke?

310
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,434
Vanessa Dahl.

311
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,558
Please, follow me.

312
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,512
You're after information
on our Project Swarm ADIs?

313
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,440
That's right.

314
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,033
Any particular reason?

315
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,670
Yes.

316
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,078
Rasmus.

317
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,874
Rasmus Sjoberg.

318
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,070
He heads Swarm.
- Nice to meet you.

319
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,872
Hi.
- Hi.

320
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,552
Nice... greenhouse.
- Yeah.

321
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,116
So, your bees, your ADIs,
talk me through them.

322
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,313
Colony Collapse Disorder.
We still don't know what's behind it.

323
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,829
Bees themselves were virtually extinct

324
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,953
so what our ADIs do
is effectively stand in for them.

325
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,314
They're solar powered.
They don't need nectar.

326
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,192
But they pollinate flowers
the same way.

327
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,358
They crawl inside,
pollen sticks to their legs

328
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,516
and gets brushed off
the next flower they visit.

329
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,029
- Can they make honey?
- Er, no.

330
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,673
I was joking.

331
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,238
How do they know where
the flowers even are?

332
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,351
I mean...
- Well, they have a sensor.

333
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,516
Like a... camera?

334
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,995
No, just a basic visual sensor.

335
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,714
You see, they need rudimentary
pattern recognition

336
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,434
in order to locate compatible flora
and navigate.

337
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,756
They navigate?
- Yes.

338
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,950
You don't... I don't know...

339
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,629
steer them?

340
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,274
They're autonomous.
That's right, isn't it?

341
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,152
They make their own decisions.
They look after themselves.

342
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,158
Yes. You see, the ADIs cover
the whole of the UK.

343
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,714
We couldn't command each one
individually ourselves.

344
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,592
It's just not logistically possible.

345
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,074
No.

346
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,475
We simply set the behaviour
and leave them to it.

347
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,080
They even construct these hives
themselves.

348
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,713
They reproduce...

349
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,630
They reproduce?
- Yes. Each hive is a replication point.

350
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,956
- It's like a 3D printer, basically.
- Exactly.

351
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,435
They create duplicates
of themselves

352
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,279
and create more hives
and spread out exponentially.

353
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,880
- Cover the country.
- Maybe you should work here.

354
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,797
Yeah, well, I read up on it.
It's impressive.

355
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,955
It is.

356
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,676
It's just a shame it's necessary.

357
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,030
The alternative would have been
environmental catastrophe.

358
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,034
Bees were dying out.

359
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,229
So, what is it that brings you here?

360
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,160
We think one of your ADIs may be involved
in an unexplained death.

361
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,797
Sorry? A death?

362
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,674
Thank you.

363
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,669
Yeah, it's one of ours.

364
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,671
But, look, these are not designed to...
- Kill people?

365
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,949
I'd hope not.

366
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,116
Could it have malfunctioned
somehow?

367
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,790
No. I mean, when they do malfunction...

368
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,515
It happens, but then they just break,
they just hit the ground.

369
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,393
What if someone hacked one and then
they found a way of controlling it?

370
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,794
That's impossible.

371
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,673
You see, it's got military-grade
encryption

372
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,872
and you would need a diagnostic controller,
which is also encrypted.

373
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,831
So I would say the likelihood is...

374
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,589
I don't know what he's saying,
but it's not the same as impossible.

375
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,520
This is every hive we have online.

376
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,040
See...

377
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,630
These are the hives in
the building here.

378
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,993
How many bees per hive?
- Around 4,000.

379
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,111
- It's like air traffic control.
- Yeah.

380
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,912
Is that the search input?

381
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,114
- Yeah, but, you'd need...
- Sorry.

382
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,631
Jo Powers' postcode.

383
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,318
Is that who this is about?

384
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,273
You said you get some malfunctions?
- A fair few, yes.

385
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,517
They smack into a car or something.
We even had people trap them.

386
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,393
You know, put them in the microwave
for a YouTube video.

387
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,272
And this logs any that
drop off the system?

388
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,515
Logs everything, yes.

389
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,790
Did you lose any round here
on Monday evening?

390
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,513
Well, I can check.

391
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,953
Just one.
Went out at 1903 hours.

392
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,071
Here, I can replay.

393
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,349
There.

394
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,272
- That's odd.
- What's odd?

395
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,553
When they pass between hives

396
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,910
they switch from one jurisdiction
to another.

397
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,190
It's, you know, like a...

398
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,072
It's like a... like a phone
between cell masts.

399
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,239
Exactly. It tried to do that,
but there was nothing to switch to.

400
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,516
Unless someone spoofed a hive and then
they've used that to commandeer your ADI.

401
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,632
No, you would need
a diagnostic controller to do that.

402
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,909
What's the range on one of those?

403
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,191
10, 20 metres, perhaps.

404
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,352
So whoever was controlling it would have
to be no more than 20 metres away.

405
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,631
- Outside the house.
- Yeah, or sitting in a car, even.

406
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,310
Can you trace back who did this?
- Yes. I-I'm already trying to do that.

407
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,791
You know what?
Erm...

408
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,995
It would be easier without
an audience.

409
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,630
OK.

410
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,278
You two swap numbers,
keep a line of communication.

411
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,960
Can you shut the whole thing down
if need be?

412
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,638
Hypothetically speaking?

413
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,399
Even a short stoppage
would damage the ecosystem

414
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,000
and we'd need approval from
the Department of the Environment.

415
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,555
We'll need a list of any Granular staff
that had access to that system

416
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,079
past or present.

417
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,758
Some of those were
government employees.

418
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,189
Use a different font for those
if it helps.

419
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,355
Bye.

420
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,269
Nick, that's a set of Granular
personnel records.

421
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,719
Root out anyone interesting.

422
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,750
Maybe not just one.

423
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,949
Could be a group involved.
- Yeah, listen...

424
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,752
Technically we should refer this
up to the NCA

425
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,598
but there's no fucking way
they're taking this off me.

426
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,278
The NCA already knows about it.

427
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,909
What?

428
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,279
DCI Karin Parke?

429
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,314
Yes.
- Shaun Li, National Crime Agency.

430
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,634
How come you're here?

431
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,034
There's been more than one.

432
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,396
This is Tusk, last night.

433
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,351
Shit.
- They thought it was a fit.

434
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,435
Took him to the hospital.

435
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,233
He had to be anaesthetised
to stop him mutilating himself.

436
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,830
X-ray seemed to indicate some kind
of plaque or tumour in his brain

437
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,315
so they popped him in the MRI.

438
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,589
Yeah.

439
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,796
Basically one big magnet.

440
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,639
Tore it right out of his head,
through the eye socket.

441
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,716
Battered the ADI, too.

442
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,038
Yours is more intact
so I'm gonna need it for analysis.

443
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,593
It's evidence.

444
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,914
Two's a pattern.

445
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,474
Knocks any malfunction theory
in the head.

446
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,512
And they're similar victims.
- Similar?

447
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,597
Both in the middle of online
shit storms.

448
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,033
Well, if you wanna kill someone,
there's a million easier ways to do it.

449
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,993
Pull this off and you've done it
from across the street.

450
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,155
No fingerprints, no DNA.

451
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,998
It's like wishing them dead.

452
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,920
Fuck.

453
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,674
Fuck.

454
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,233
Guys? Come here.

455
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,793
OK, so, erm...

456
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,714
Jo Powers and Tusk

457
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,115
both were being kicked around
the Internet for hours

458
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,835
but in both their cases,
people were also tweeting their photos

459
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,394
DeathTo.

460
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,872
Like our friend the teacher.
- Right.

461
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,800
She didn't know where she'd first
heard of it, but trace it back

462
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,549
and it looks like the first real use
of the hashtag was last weekend.

463
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,671
- By who?
- Er...

464
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,438
Looks like, erm...

465
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,437
Looks like identical tweets
from a set of duplicate bot accounts.

466
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,519
Erm...

467
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,233
Automated.

468
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,478
It's like spam.

469
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,750
This is someone trying
to seed the tag, you know?

470
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,110
Get it out there. It's like bait.

471
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,549
This is someone wanting people
to pick up on it.

472
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,596
Check out the senders' avatar photos.

473
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,431
Bees. Shit.

474
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,394
OK.

475
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,230
There's more.

476
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,070
So each tweet had a sort of
instruction video attached to it.

477
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,519
There.

478
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,995
'Game of Consequences'?

479
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,872
It's like an unpopularity contest.

480
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,313
Pick someone you don't like and if enough
other people choose the same name

481
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,636
then that's who gets targeted.

482
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,633
Here, watch.

483
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,191
Game of Consequences.

484
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,439
- Pick a target.
- My God.

485
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,077
Post their name and photo
with DeathTo.

486
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,155
No.

487
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,878
Most popular target will be
eliminated after 5 p.m. each day.

488
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,912
Game resets at midnight.

489
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,076
- No, no.
- Fuck.

490
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,039
Someone's holding a public ballot,
bumping off the top person.

491
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,957
Jesus, it's just mad.

492
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,673
Yeah, and it's growing.

493
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,593
Day one, 63 people used
the hashtag on Jo Powers. OK?

494
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,349
On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.

495
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,633
Who's using it now?

496
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,354
There's... I mean,
there's loads more people.

497
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,071
There's quite a few votes
for the Chancellor.

498
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,554
Yeah.
- Erm...

499
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,796
But at number one...

500
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:29,233
is 880 people using it
on someone called Clara Meades.

501
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,113
Who's she?
- Clara Meades.

502
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,437
OK, erm... it looks like she
was at a demo

503
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,393
and she took a selfie
in front of a war memorial...

504
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,719
pretending to piss on it.

505
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,838
Nice work, Clara.
- Yeah.

506
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,029
It's getting near the end
of the vote

507
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,479
and her mentions are blowing up.

508
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,077
Tusk isn't public knowledge yet?
- Um, no.

509
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,236
So people can't know
the hashtag works.

510
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,839
They're using it to scare her.

511
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,473
Yeah, but they're gonna
get her killed.

512
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,670
And we need to get to her before five.

513
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,757
Yeah. Pulling her citizens details.

514
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,119
You're not supposed
to have access to that.

515
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,913
Yeah, I know.
Just getting her location.

516
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,074
There.

517
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,599
Fuck...

518
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,472
Hello?

519
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,879
Yeah, she is, but...

520
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,079
Alright, alright, hold on.

521
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,110
Clara!

522
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,196
Police. For you.

523
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,159
How did they get my number?

524
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,392
Hello?
- Clara Meades?

525
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,397
This is DCI Karin Parke, Met Police.

526
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,750
Sorry to track you down like this,
but we think you may be in danger.

527
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,279
Sorry, is this a joke?

528
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,072
'Cause all this stuff I'm getting,
it's not funny.

529
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,919
I'm not joking.
Stay where you are until we get there.

530
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,198
And keep your windows closed.

531
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,919
I'm setting up a perimeter.

532
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,437
Call Rasmus,
we need him across this.

533
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,554
Rasmus?
- Hi, Blue.

534
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,716
I'm sending you a postcode
and my GPS.

535
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,592
I need you to monitor the area.

536
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,952
Track my location and see if you get
anything unusual, any rogue ADIs, yeah?

537
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,399
Yeah, great, good.

538
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,317
Look, if they come back

539
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,634
I think I can catch them.

540
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,671
...I have basically set a trap.

541
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,633
So if they... if they try it again,
we've got them.

542
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,956
Are you Batman?
- They only just rolled them out.

543
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,360
This'll turn every red light
between here and there to green.

544
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,677
Fuck me. If this is the NCA life,
I should apply for a transfer.

545
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,869
Let's go.

546
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,199
We can take her here.

547
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,470
It's a safe house
for terrorist informers usually.

548
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,035
This is a police operation!

549
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,754
Please leave...

550
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,360
- What's that?
- Someone's trying to break in.

551
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,270
Rasmus?

552
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,311
Blue, I just picked up an
attempted breach.

553
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,874
OK? Granular, they've got a breach.

554
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,191
- One ADI/ just went offline.
- Where?

555
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,949
800 metres from your location.
- That's outside our cordon.

556
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,838
If someone's trying to pilot
it this way

557
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,553
they're gonna turn round
the moment they see all these uniforms.

558
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,519
Clara Meades?
- Yeah.

559
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,392
I'm Karin Parke.
Did you pack a bag?

560
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,558
Yeah, it's by the door.
- Right, let's go.

561
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,320
Rasmus got a track on them?
- Not yet.

562
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,797
It's just precautionary,
and it's only for one night.

563
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,438
Just gotta call in.

564
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,229
Hi.

565
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,034
No, not yet.

566
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,073
Hopefully never.

567
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,274
Granular are onto it.

568
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,915
Understood.

569
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,194
They housed a witness here
for a while, Shaun said.

570
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,120
Must've had Kids.

571
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,997
- Have you got kids?
- No.

572
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,394
No plans.

573
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,274
Up the stairs.

574
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,394
- Rasmus.
- Still nothing. I can't trace it.

575
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,631
At least there's an en-suite.

576
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,433
- Is there nothing?
- No.

577
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,472
Whoever it is, they've masked
their path well.

578
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,554
But that's not...

579
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,676
What?

580
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,951
We just lost a whole hive.
- What does that mean?

581
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,274
Packed full of ADIs.

582
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,640
Lost them all too.

583
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,593
No... Rasmus?
- There's thousands of them.

584
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,280
Where?
- It's close to your location.

585
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,118
Rasmus, say that again.

586
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,596
Blue? Blue, it's close...
it's very close to...

587
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,793
Text it. Text it to me.
Rasmus, text it to...

588
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,910
Shit.

589
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,153
Do I get to redecorate?

590
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,837
Hello. Hello.

591
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,719
No...

592
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,958
They've got the whole thing.

593
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,032
We're not in control anymore.

594
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,674
- They've got the whole thing.
- What are you doing?

595
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,870
Fix it!

596
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,438
Can't you fix it?
- Shut up!

597
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,190
Shit.

598
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,675
We need to go. Now.
Now, Clara!

599
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,431
Go, go, go, go.

600
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,477
What is... what's happening?

601
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,479
Karin...

602
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,277
In there! Go!

603
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,475
- Help me block the gap!
- Tell me what's going on!

604
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,715
You're scaring the shit out of me!

605
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,794
Fuck!

606
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,511
The fan! The fan!

607
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,633
Get it away from me!

608
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,235
Take your time.

609
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,392
I'd seen so many bodies before.

610
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,674
At crime scenes, in autopsies.

611
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,676
But I'd never seen anyone die.

612
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,833
And she was right there.

613
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:33,231
And can you describe the reaction
of your colleague, Miss Colson?

614
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,638
Blue took it hard.

615
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,239
Shaun.

616
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,713
I'll shut it down before then.

617
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,349
We thought this was one guy,
some Mr Mystery in the vicinity

618
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,472
hijacking one ADI
and personally controlling it.

619
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,477
But there were thousands of them.

620
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,158
So it can't be that, right?
- No.

621
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,873
One person can't fly
hundreds at once.

622
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,480
No, whoever this is,
they're controlling the whole system.

623
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,919
Do you know where they're
controlling it from?

624
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,109
No, could be anywhere.

625
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,071
Well, you need to fucking
sort this out!

626
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,995
How do the ADIs know who to target?

627
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,673
Could've found Clara the same way
you did, the identity database.

628
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,836
No. That just gives you the basic area.

629
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,554
We were in the room, too,
and they only went for her.

630
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:53,511
Facial recognition.
It's got to be facial recognition.

631
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,471
Which means the feed
from their visual sensors

632
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,749
that's been accessed, too.

633
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,279
- That's not possible.
- It's the only explanation.

634
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:02,473
Now, look, the visual feed is secure
between each ADI and the hive.

635
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,716
There you go.
- Although...

636
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,070
one of the government's conditions
for backing the project...

637
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,349
OK. Enough.
- ... was that we...

638
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,869
we had to consent to permitting...
- Enough.

639
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,514
...government security services access

640
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:18,077
to the visual feed at times of, quote,
'Increased national security.'

641
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,795
Which is, as I understand it,
pretty much all the time.

642
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,396
I wasn't happy about it.
- Your lot went along with it.

643
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,592
Well, that implies a greater range
of options than your lot presented.

644
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,359
So they are spying on us.
- This is all classified.

645
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,951
So what did you do, did you put in
a backdoor and route it through GCHQ?

646
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,038
I mean, you do CCTV, you do traffic cams.

647
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,957
So what don't you have
your fucking noses in?

648
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,470
Look, millions of those things
flying around, propping up the ecosystem?

649
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,672
Well, that's just great, save the planet,
hallelujah!

650
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,677
Government's not going
to pump billions into it

651
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,031
just 'cause some lab coat says so,
it grabs 200 green votes.

652
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,912
They saw an opportunity to get more,
they took it.

653
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,520
Total nationwide surveillance.

654
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,870
We've tracked suspects for weeks
in ways they couldn't dream of.

655
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,390
We've prevented bombings, mass shootings.
- By spying on the public.

656
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,909
And keeping them safe,
which is what they want.

657
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,110
Clara Meades isn't safe, though,
is she, Shaun?

658
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,032
Knowing what you knew,
that might've helped us, but, no,

659
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,753
you kept your little
fucking secret, didn't you?

660
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,317
OK! The government's a cunt.
We knew that already.

661
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,829
Word's going to get out about Clara.

662
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:28,397
The public's going to wake up and find
this mental assassination game going on

663
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,875
and soon we're going to have
another body.

664
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,517
So what do we do?
- I don't know.

665
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,916
We're... we're totally locked out.
Totally blind.

666
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,831
If I can work out how they got in

667
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,714
I might be able to reverse engineer
some means of getting control back.

668
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,559
Do the ADIs have a command log,
on-board cache?

669
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,830
Yeah, but that's encrypted.
- Right, well, I'll need the key to that.

670
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,594
Been through the employee files,
found some POls.

671
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,153
Bring them in.

672
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,869
Are you sitting in on these?
Granular interviews?

673
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,274
I've got to be somewhere.

674
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,753
It's 7:15.

675
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,839
<i>Three deaths have now been linked
to a hashtag circulating on social media.</i>

676
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,678
Controversial journalist
Jo Powers...

677
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,189
Good morning.
Have you posted the hashtag?

678
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,197
Is it real or an urban myth?

679
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,870
Well, thousands have been taking part,
but how culpable are they?

680
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,515
People are dying and we want
to hear your thoughts.

681
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,153
Line seven, Liana...

682
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,713
This is real, this is happening...

683
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,916
! am happy to see her die.

684
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,519
It's not the hashtag
who's the one killing them.

685
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,676
That's just a game.

686
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,872
Like, if you're an arsehole,
you deserve to be shamed.

687
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,480
Steve, line five.

688
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,034
Yeah, but my point is,
someone's gotta be top of the list, yeah?

689
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:05,630
So why not make it someone, you know,
like, who deserves it, like a racist.

690
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,036
Right now, with the hashtag,
I've seen celebrities, politicians, everyone.

691
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,833
This doesn't mean you have to sit there
encouraging people to take part.

692
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,871
The point is this is already happening.

693
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,433
And people know that they
can jump on-board

694
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,517
because nobody will ever know
if they did or didn't.

695
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:20,552
Well, let's just pause for a moment
and go back to that top five.

696
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,991
As we have been saying,
the Chancellor is at number one,

697
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,474
and I want us to think about that.

698
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,989
What does that tell us
about the choice of the nation?

699
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:31,999
Well, I can't say I'm surprised
that he's number one on the list.

700
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,316
He's been pretty unpopular
for quite a long time now.

701
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,636
But does that warrant
his place on this list?

702
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,479
What I'm saying is people
don't have to think too hard about it.

703
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,919
Now that's he's number one

704
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,237
that should generate more discussions
and probably more votes.

705
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,559
Thanks for your time.

706
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,712
No good?
- No good.

707
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,680
Well, that's all fascinating...
- Shaun.

708
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,109
But when do we shut it down?
- Tom.

709
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,357
Forgive me for being sceptical
about your agency's basic competence.

710
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,710
Tom.
- I'm on the fucking chopping block here.

711
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,513
Number one on the list.
The people's fucking choice!

712
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,710
Farrington's number four
and he's a paedophile.

713
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,559
Suspected paedophile.
- He did it. You know he did.

714
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,600
Let's just shut it down.
All social media.

715
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,392
The whole bloody Internet,
pull the plug.

716
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,155
Just for today

717
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,430
at least until Thumbelina here
pulls his finger out

718
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,595
and he actually catches someone.

719
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,154
I wouldn't advise shutting things down.
- But it's possible?

720
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,555
We can do that?
- The whole of social media?

721
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,558
Yeah. Pull a North Korea on it.
- Well, yes, technically.

722
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,876
- Right, so push the off switch.
- That's not a good idea.

723
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,033
No?
- Not in my opinion.

724
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,434
Right, OK.

725
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:27,235
It's just that speaking as a marked man,
I beg to fucking differ.

726
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,752
If we shut it down,
you'll still be number one.

727
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,279
Guaranteed to be, in fact.

728
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,870
He's right. If we let it run on,
at least there's a few hours.

729
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,072
Anything could happen before five o'clock.
The vote might change.

730
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,679
Yeah, and it might not.

731
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,677
What about that report?
The archive job?

732
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,710
From 1985, that memo
about Farrington?

733
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,513
- That was over an unrelated matter.
- Leak it.

734
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,517
Tom, that would be a smear.

735
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,551
A head-to-toe shit smear,
I fucking hope so.

736
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,194
He's in his 80s. He's had his life.
Fuck him under the bus.

737
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,992
If I could suggest an alternative?

738
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,833
We move you to a safe location.

739
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,555
Have you secured before five.
- Worked out well for you last night.

740
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,031
I'll show you.

741
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,351
This next one's Tess Wallender.
She was a junior.

742
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,311
So not much in the way
of technical skills.

743
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:25,318
Quit Granular for personal reasons.
- Nervous exhaustion, yeah.

744
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:28,398
Worked in Human Resources
for Granular until she quit.

745
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,876
She took a photo of a guy on the tube,
said he'd harassed her.

746
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,115
Lewd comments or something.

747
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,719
But it turned out he had a
learning disability

748
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,717
so she caught a tonne
of shit on...

749
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,114
On social media.

750
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:49,638
Hello. I'm DCI Karin Parke.
- Hi.

751
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:04,591
It was like having a whole
weather system turn against me.

752
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,076
It was just hate message
after hate message

753
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,555
around the clock, all piling on.

754
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,196
It's hard to describe what that does
to your head.

755
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:19,195
Just suddenly
there's a million invisible people

756
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:22,471
all talking about how
they despise you.

757
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,834
It's... it's like a mental illness.

758
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,390
Fuck.

759
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,434
What?

760
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,515
Shit.

761
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,749
I mean, hands up, I made a mistake

762
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:53,316
but the way people enjoyed
kicking me, that...

763
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,475
that's what got to me.

764
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,915
The casual fun they had...

765
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,354
and, erm...

766
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,113
I just felt I couldn't go on.

767
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,274
Who found you?

768
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,197
Erm... Garrett, my flatmate.

769
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,834
He found me in the bath
five minutes after I slashed them.

770
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,073
I mean, it's crazy.

771
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,434
I'm half-conscious.

772
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,838
He's dragging me out of the bath

773
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,679
and I'm telling him to get out,
saying, 'I'm naked.'

774
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:38,038
He tied towels round my wrists,
kept me conscious

775
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:43,029
kept stroking my hair
till the ambulance arrived, talking to me.

776
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,472
Sort of weird.

777
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,909
I think he always had a thing for me.

778
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,919
And we worked at the same place so,
you know... awkward.

779
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,555
He worked at Granular?
- Yeah. On the ADI thing.

780
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,718
He was a real wunderkind.
Ultra-smart.

781
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,319
What did you say his name was?

782
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,478
Garrett. Garrett Scholes.

783
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:15,593
Garrett Scholes.
We need the whereabouts of a Garrett...

784
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,836
Scholes.
We were about to tell you.

785
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,156
It was buried in the on-board memory
of the Jo Powers ADI.

786
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:24,034
What was?
- A manifesto. A 98-page manifesto.

787
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,920
And check this out.
There's fucking selfies in it.

788
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,993
So we're good to go?

789
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,871
Okay, that's the charge in place.

790
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,912
OK. Pull back.

791
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,958
We're all set here.

792
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,274
Detonate.

793
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:15,235
So, the plan is, we move you
to an underground bunker.

794
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,395
Knock out every hive
within a ten-mile radius.

795
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,272
And, what, just leave me there?
How long for?

796
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,518
It's a temporary measure.

797
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,070
How long till you take out
all the hives?

798
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:29,670
There's 20, 30,000 of them.
That would take two years.

799
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,711
Two years, a victim a day.

800
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,558
Yes, but more to the point,
the environmental impact would...

801
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,238
Fuck that.

802
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,274
Shit!

803
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,878
What? Fuck!

804
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,836
Stay back, stay back!

805
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,915
Get back!

806
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:53,319
Go, go, go! Get away!

807
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,473
What's your Plan B?

808
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:44,474
He was on the original employee roster,
but we discounted him.

809
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,713
He left the country six months ago.

810
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,273
We thought we were looking
for someone nearby.

811
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:50,914
Run a full trace on him.
Everything we can find.

812
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,112
Lunatic with production values,
that's the worst kind.

813
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,669
'Thanks to the technological
revolution

814
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:02,510
we have the power to rage and accuse,
spout bile without consequence.

815
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:06,110
Only by being forced to recognise
the power technology grants us

816
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,470
to acknowledge
individual responsibility...'

817
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,395
Is it all like this?

818
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,994
He likens the population to insects,
says we revel in cruelty.

819
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,680
That it's a weakness
that should be bred out of us.

820
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:21,759
Recurrent theme is he wants people to face
the consequences of what they say and do.

821
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:25,634
Wants to force that on them.
- The whole thing's a moral lesson?

822
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,429
He wanted us to find this
and spread it about.

823
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:32,800
Well, fuck him.

824
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,075
Fuck.

825
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,439
Shit.

826
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,196
Karin. Karin. He's messed up.

827
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,434
He's put this document
together himself, right?

828
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,874
His author name's in the metadata

829
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,479
but he stripped out everything else

830
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,670
so we don't know when he's written it,
for example.

831
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:58,356
Most of the photos are clipart
off the Internet, except this one.

832
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,835
- The selfie.
- That's where he's screwed up.

833
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,439
He's taken it with his phone

834
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,914
and the phone has left a geotag
on the image.

835
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:07,794
So you know where he took this?
- I know precisely where.

836
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,117
He's here and Granular HQ is there.

837
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,231
Armed police! Stay down!
- Armed police!

838
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,679
Armed police!

839
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,358
Armed police!
Stay where you are!

840
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,913
Armed police! Show yourselves!

841
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,519
Move!

842
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,036
Left.

843
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,673
Clear!
- Clear!

844
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,358
Clear!

845
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,877
Lifestyles of the rich and famous.

846
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,552
There. The forge.

847
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,395
Nice one.

848
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:36,839
Half the drives I sifted in forensics
had scorch marks on 'em.

849
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:53,279
- What do you think?
- Yeah. Looks like his toolkit.

850
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,753
And you can use it?
- Pretty much the key to the door.

851
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,395
So you can get control back?
Send the deactivation?

852
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,397
Well, I've got his source code.

853
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,035
I should be able to bounce him out.
- Be quick.

854
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,798
Key to the door?

855
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:10,639
Our guy doesn't seem the type
to leave keys lying around.

856
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,918
- Well, I'm in.

857
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,199
OK. Deactivate her.

858
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:20,074
Yeah, I... I need to repair permissions.
- Fucking hell.

859
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,115
That's weird.

860
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:27,875
What's weird?

861
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:31,356
- Time's ticking.
- That file wasn't there before.

862
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,073
This file?
- Yeah.

863
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,270
What is it?

864
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,599
Blue?
- I think they're IMEI numbers.

865
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,714
What does that mean?

866
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,320
Erm, every phone, every...
every device

867
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,273
has a unique number,
an IMEI number.

868
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,755
It tethers it to a unique user.
- Yeah.

869
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,633
But I can check, just... reverse lookup.
- Come on, we don't have...

870
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:01,795
Yeah, take it easy.

871
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,715
Who are these people?

872
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,469
I dunno.
There's 387,000 of them.

873
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,272
Are these IDs
your spooks have been collecting?

874
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,278
No! Are you... are you ready yet?
- Yeah, almost there.

875
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,435
Wait. Wait.

876
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,909
What was the name of that teacher?
Erm, hate cake.

877
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,679
Liza. Liza Bahar.
- Liza Bahar.

878
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,197
Fuck's sake.

879
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,749
This is a list of everyone
who's used the hashtag.

880
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:32,835
What?

881
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,996
Everyone who took part
in the Game of Consequences.

882
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:38,396
They've hoovered up their ID from GCHQ
by the looks of it.

883
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,830
That backdoor worked both ways,
it seems.

884
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,430
See if I'm on there.
- What?

885
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,869
I posted the tag earlier
with Scholes' face.

886
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,999
I was just trying to get a
reaction from him.

887
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,599
Come on.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, almost there.

888
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,074
Yeah, you're there.

889
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,879
Almost there.

890
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,834
Why has he collected everyone
who took part? I mean...

891
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:05,276
OK. I'm ready.

892
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,875
Shit.
- OK, run it now.

893
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,072
No. Think. He left us a trail.

894
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,111
- Come on.
- That photo with the whereabouts

895
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,595
it's too big a mistake for him.
He knew we'd do this.

896
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,677
Yeah, and now we're
shutting it down, alright?

897
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:21,234
And maybe that'll trigger
some endgame.

898
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,759
Something to do with that list.

899
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,950
What if those are his real targets?

900
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,274
The people on the list.

901
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,633
Everyone who took part.

902
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,913
Consequences.

903
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,792
The hate figures were the bait.

904
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,350
The players are the target.

905
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,874
Run the de-act command.
- Wait, wait, just wait a minute, OK?

906
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,069
- Run it.
- No!

907
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,273
Yeah...

908
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,792
Yeah, it worked.

909
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,478
Fuck.

910
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,433
Sorry, but that needed doing.

911
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:21,112
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

912
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,753
No. No.

913
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,271
- Fuck!
- No.

914
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,553
Shit.

915
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,159
No.

936
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:12,549
We're all tragically familiar with
the rest of the events of that week.

937
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:18,230
And we need no reminding
of the sheer scale

938
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:21,193
of the loss of life that followed.

939
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:24,835
No.

940
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,119
No, we don't.

941
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,357
And what became of Miss Colson?

942
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,837
I think she blamed herself.

943
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,033
I know she did.

944
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,229
She felt she'd followed
his breadcrumb trail

945
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:27,079
and sprung the whole thing.

946
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,397
She left the force.

947
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,312
I didn't hear from her.

948
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:41,592
Rang her, I tried emailing,
but no response.

949
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,279
Then, erm...

950
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,959
About four months later

951
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:56,913
they found her things.

952
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,720
On a beach.

953
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,553
With a note.

954
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,759
She killed herself?

955
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,592
That's the base theory, yes.

956
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:34,279
Miss Parke

957
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,316
I would like to commend you

958
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:40,671
for sharing your testimony
and your time.

959
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:43,955
Thank you.

960
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:47,999
Thank you.

961
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,316
