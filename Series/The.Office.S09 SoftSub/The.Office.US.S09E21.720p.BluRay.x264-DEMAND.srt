1
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,690
I'm taking some
time off from work...

2
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,364
Well, my other work

3
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,649
because we needed it.

4
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,440
It's great.

5
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,209
The phone's been
ringing off the hook.

6
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,964
The guys in Philly
are kind of going nuts.

7
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,280
But that doesn't matter.

8
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,851
This does.

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,810
It's the only thing
that matters.

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,530
We've had some really
nice days together.

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,966
Mmm-hmm.

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,401
Nice morning, too.

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,767
Beesly. Oh, my God.

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,521
Hey-

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,570
Which tie makes me look
like a guy who likes sofas?

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,768
My agent's putting me up
for a furniture commercial.

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,330
Ah. Definitely blue.

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,811
Totally, right?

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,686
So, Big Tuna, what's up?
Back in the small pond?

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,207
For now, yeah, yeah. I was just
spreading myself way too thin...

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,363
Thin-sliced Tuna.
Carpaccio. Go on.

22
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,442
Well, it took me a while.

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,763
But I finally realized
that I can't give 100%

24
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,410
to two things at once,
you know?

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,767
Yeah. Tell me
about it.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,571
I've been trying to act
and manage this branch.

27
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,126
Half the time, I don't
know if I'm wearing

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,964
my stage makeup
or my work makeup.

29
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,087
Huh.

30
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,446
Well, you know,
you can't have everything,

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,000
so you gotta ask yourself
what makes you the happiest.

32
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,607
You just go all in for what's most
important. That's my new thing.

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,603
Is everything okay?

34
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,524
No. Everything
is not okay.

35
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,171
The county
took my cats.

36
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,526
Wait, all of them?

37
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,965
Two sacks' worth.

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,289
Apparently, my apartment
complex has rules

39
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,682
about how many pets are
too many for a studio.

40
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,249
And while I was out picking Phillip
up from daycare, they came.

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,970
They came into my house.

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,361
That's awful, Angela.
I'm so sorry.

43
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,171
It's the
that lives downstairs.

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,404
She's this uptight, judgmental shrew.
You know the type.

45
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,450
I've never met
anyone like that.

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,651
And they're gone.

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,486
And I have no one left.

48
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,600
Without my cats, lam utterly
and completely alone.

49
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,291
Angela, you still
have your son.

50
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,608
I guess.

51
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,807
Attention, everyone.
May I have your attention?

52
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,568
There are four new deadly
weapons in this office.

53
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,931
Basher, thrasher,
crasher and...

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,001
Smasher.

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,889
"Smasher"? No.
Where'd you get that?

56
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,088
Fireball!

57
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,086
This morning,
after hours of combat

58
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,764
with some of
the city's best teenagers,

59
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,447
learned my black belt
in Goju-Ryu martial arts.

60
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,047
I had to find a new dojo after
Sensei Ira and I parted ways.

61
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,849
My new sensei,
Sensei Billy,

62
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,685
thought I had more than enough
training to take the test.

63
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,446
Turns out Sensei Ira
was a bit of a shyster.

64
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,761
Sensei Billy says
most students

65
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,640
don't spend $150,000 over 20
years to get their black belt.

66
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,247
I would like to invite you all
to my black belt ceremony,

67
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,163
right here in
the office at lunch.

68
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,406
Lunch not provided.

69
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,201
Fireball!

70
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,769
That's how it's done.

71
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,842
That's pretty good.
I feel safe.

72
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,802
Hey, Erin.
ls Andy in?

73
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,720
Oh! ls Andy in? Sorry, I
thought you said, "ls Indian?"

74
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,167
And I was like,
"ls Indian what?"

75
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,046
ls Indian food good?
ls Indian jewelry pretty?

76
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,284
Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig?
Yes to all three, by the way.

77
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,442
Lately, I've been
having a lot of trouble

78
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,010
keeping track of
Andy's calendar.

79
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,811
His student film audition
schedule is crazy hectic.

80
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,531
Yes. There's Andy. Andy is in.
I'm a good receptionist.

81
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,681
I know he's in.

82
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,491
David Walrus
in his native habitat.

83
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,925
Hey, Andy.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,968
Can we go in your office and talk?
Yeah.

85
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,963
This isn't gonna be
an easy conversation.

86
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,609
I told Andy that he
was on very thin ice

87
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,251
when he snuck away for three
months to the Caribbean.

88
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,322
Then last week,
he used company money

89
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,641
to buy a top-of-the-line
photo printer.

90
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,202
In his words, "The kind
that's good for headshots."

91
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,921
And yesterday, he asked me
to pay for cheek implants.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,083
Claimed it's going to boost office morale.
Now, he's a good guy.

93
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,889
But honestly,
at a certain point,

94
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,327
the ice gets too thin,
and you fall through.

95
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,405
And that is
when you get fired.

96
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,407
Andy...

97
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,891
I'm gonna stop
you right there.

98
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,644
David, this documentary is
going to air in two weeks.

99
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,769
I feel like it's a once in a lifetime
opportunity to pursue my dream.

100
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,367
Uh-huh. But...

101
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,171
Every minute
that I spend here

102
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,686
is time not spent
making audition videos

103
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,525
for reality dating,
cooking or singing shows.

104
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,123
I got a real shot here.

105
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,363
And I'll never be
able to forgive myself

106
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,930
if I blew it because
I was too focused

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,684
on my stupid
paper companyjob.

108
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,040
No offense.

109
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,487
So you think you've been
too focused on your job?

110
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,324
At my last
headshotsfifing,

111
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,051
I was so distracted wondering
what I was missing at work

112
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,283
that I came across totally manic.
And I was going for zany.

113
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,730
So you want to quit Dunder
Mifflin to pursue acting?

114
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,280
Well, no, actually.

115
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,682
I see no reason to limit
myself to just acting.

116
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,807
I am pursuing fame
of any kind.

117
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,725
Could be singing. Could be dancing.
I don't... ltjust...

118
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,929
I owe it to myself
and my future fans.

119
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,329
Well, I guess I can't stand
in the way of a man's dream.

120
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,762
And it seems like
you have the gift.

121
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,524
Thank you, David.

122
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,210
There's probably
no way I can talk you

123
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,566
into staying at
this point, huh?

124
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,081
Nope. lhave
made up my mind.

125
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,321
I'm really sorry.

126
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,687
Well, good luck.

127
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,650
Hey, thank you.
Not gonna need it.

128
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,445
Okay-

129
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,649
Well, that kind
of worked out.

130
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,250
I think just about
anybody can be a star.

131
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,369
My postman, the nightjanitor here...
But Andy?

132
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,887
No, definitely not.
Charisma black hole.

133
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,211
Oh! Clark.

134
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,965
I'm actually here
today. Surprise.

135
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,088
So I was wondering if maybe
I could have my desk back.

136
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,527
Right. Yeah.

137
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,965
But, you know, I've
actually been working

138
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,407
pretty hard here
on a daily basis.

139
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,130
So, I kind of feel
like I've earned this.

140
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,326
I mean, you know?
You totally have.

141
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,483
You have earned it. But maybe
I could be with my wife.

142
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,720
It's kind of the
whole reason why I'm here.

143
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,841
Right.

144
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,684
Well, I'm here
to sell paper.

145
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,161
Burn.

146
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,366
Wow.

147
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,489
All right, Jim, look. I just
got made junior salesman.

148
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,449
Right? And Wallace
is here today.

149
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,522
And I don't want him
to just think of me

150
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,410
as a customer service rep
that sits in the annex.

151
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,687
I mean, you can get that,
right? Right?

152
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,808
And what do you need more
face time with Wallace for?

153
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,601
You trying to get
a second second job here?

154
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,402
It's okay.
You can sit in the annex.

155
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,606
What?

156
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,761
I'll come visit you.

157
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,930
Okay-

158
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,730
The annex it is.

159
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,850
I'll be sitting at your desk,
if that's okay with you.

160
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,491
It's fine with me.
Have fun. But be careful.

161
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,610
It is very easy to get lost in
Pete's beautiful, dead eyes.

162
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,209
Everyone, a little breaking news for you.

163
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,608
Just had a little chat
with David Wallace.

164
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,969
And I'm taking a leave of absence
from Dunder Mifflin forever.

165
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,849
I can't say
we didn't see it coming,

166
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,730
but it's a sad day
when anybody is fired.

167
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,086
- We're so sorry, Andy...
Uh-uh-uh.

168
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,321
Andy was not fired.

169
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,126
I wasn't fired. What are
you talking about?

170
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,807
I'm fired up. Yes.

171
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,643
Guys, I'm leaving to pursue my
lifelong dream of being famous.

172
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,651
On, Andy.

173
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,610
Yeah, so I'll see you
on the red carpet.

174
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,683
'Cause see,
that's how it works.

175
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,527
Andy sings beautifully,

176
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,562
and he's really good at dancing.
He's a good speaker.

177
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,201
But there's just something there
you don't want to look at.

178
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,882
Hey, how am I doing as your
desk mate, by the way?

179
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,885
You probably
miss Clark.

180
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,728
Yeah, a little bit.

181
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,768
Wow. But, um...
I get that...

182
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,922
No, no.
No, it's cool.

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,001
I get it.

184
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,366
It's cool, man.

185
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,284
I'm sure you and I
will have our own thing.

186
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,160
Yeah. Definitely.
Go Phillies, right?

187
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,329
You don't watch baseball.
I keep forgetting that.

188
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,126
I just think you're going
into this a little fast.

189
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,044
I'm 38, Darryl.
How much slower should I go?

190
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,929
Show business is cold.

191
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,606
Let's say you get a job,
which you probably won't.

192
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,848
They're not gonna
cut you any slack.

193
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,491
You're meant for a job
with lots and lots of slack.

194
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,606
All right. I get it.

195
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,685
The male
is a funny species.

196
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,809
We don't just tell each other how we feel.
That's chick stuff.

197
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,010
So instead of saying,
"Hey, Andy, I love you, man.

198
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,125
"I don't want you to leave,"

199
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,164
you say something like,

200
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,447
"Hey, Andy, you're making the
worst mistake of your life.

201
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,204
"You're not talented."

202
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,250
Well...

203
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,644
Right back
at you, Darryl.

204
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,290
I'm gonna
miss you, too.

205
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,764
Andy's from the generation that
thinks they should all be famous.

206
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,330
What happened
to the generation

207
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,368
that knew you shut up,
did your work

208
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,767
and died quietly
from a heart attack?

209
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,846
Could Andy make it
as an entertainer?

210
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,731
I don't know. You know
who's really funny?

211
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,202
This bird in the park
that can't fly right.

212
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,203
I'd pay to see him.

213
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,409
But I don't have to,
'cause the park is free.

214
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,560
I will now perform the ceremonial
changing of the belts.

215
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,689
He will now perform the
ceremonial changing of the belts.

216
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,848
It's not a large room.
I think they heard me.

217
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,524
Take my belt,
Master.

218
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,042
I now submit to you
every part of myself.

219
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,930
That's really okay. I'm mostly
focused on the belt here.

220
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,084
Just slip it off my...
Slip it off my hips.

221
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,161
Hold it...

222
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,009
Take a step back.
Take a step back.

223
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,885
Okay, okay,
I can't...

224
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,248
I can't do this if you're gonna
be thrusting like that, okay?

225
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,209
I think we're gonna
have to cut this off.

226
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,647
He will now perform the ceremonial
cutting off of the belt.

227
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,806
He...

228
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,090
Dwight has been practicing
karate for years.

229
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,926
When we were dating, I would help
him with his strength training.

230
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,927
He would strap me to his chest in a
Baby Bjorn made for fat children

231
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,162
and do lunges
across the farm.

232
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,968
I felt like I was flying.

233
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,646
There it is.

234
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,011
Congratulations. Good job.
We did it, we did it.

235
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,285
I love you.
Okay.

236
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,725
Thanks.

237
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,960
I will now perform
my final kata forms.

238
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,929
You're going to watch me, right?
Yes, I will.

239
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,409
Sensei, you're not watching.
Yeah, I'm watching.

240
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,970
Just do it.

241
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,881
Ha! Ha!

242
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,649
Watching?
I'm watching.

243
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,927
Watch this part, okay?

244
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,447
Oh. Oh!

245
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,206
Sensei, do you generally
do house calls like this?

246
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,964
You can just
call me Billy.

247
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,162
And no. No,
but Dwight insisted.

248
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,844
He wanted to receive
his black belt

249
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,644
in the place he loves
most in the world.

250
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,051
He said that?

251
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,847
He's an odd guy,
isn't he?

252
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,921
Yes.

253
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,888
Irritating? Also yes.

254
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,485
But I've got
to hand it to him,

255
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,204
he is one of
the most tenacious

256
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,930
and determined men
I've ever met.

257
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,050
I am so proud of you,
Schruberry blue.

258
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,644
I really felt like I almost lost her.
And nothing is worth that.

259
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,166
Boy, I tell you, Jim,
a lot of guys in my circle,

260
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,163
they wouldn't even change
their golf schedule

261
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,006
to shore up their marriage, let
alone their professional goals.

262
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,247
Dude, there is no way
that Jim is just back here

263
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,964
to "hang out with Pam."

264
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,367
Oh!

265
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,249
You did not just say that.

266
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,366
You don't know Pam.
She is really cool.

267
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,444
All I'm saying is,
forget about my chair.

268
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,002
He wants the manager's chair. And
I thought you wanted that job.

269
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,320
Yeah, I did.

270
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,768
But I made
too many mistakes.

271
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,087
It's out of my reach now.

272
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,606
Besides, I think Jim
would be a fine manager.

273
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,801
I'd be happy to see
Jim as manager.

274
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,961
So the reason I called you in here
is because Andy is moving on.

275
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,691
Again.

276
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,281
And I'm looking
for a new manager.

277
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,607
And with his performance
this year,

278
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,128
I have been
considering Dwight.

279
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,480
Am I crazy?

280
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,526
Not at all.

281
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,526
It should be Dwight.

282
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,165
You sure?

283
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,088
You're going to want to invest in
a lot more liability insurance,

284
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,889
but...
Yeah.

285
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,327
Hey, if there's someone who
loves paper more than Dwight,

286
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,924
I definitely don't want
to meet that person.

287
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,643
Andy, we just wondered
if we could have a word.

288
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,767
It's now or never.

289
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,765
Well, we just had a quick question
about this decision of yours.

290
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,207
You know, to leave
a stable job

291
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,881
and pursue a career
in the entertainment business

292
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,328
in your late 30s with no
savings to fall back on

293
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,371
and no real connections in that
business, which can be competitive.

294
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,285
Yeah, sure.
What's your question?

295
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,210
Our question is...

296
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,725
it seems dumb.

297
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,242
Well, it's better than sticking around
here and half-assing it, right?

298
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,651
Of course.

299
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,328
But what if you were
to stay here,

300
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,927
you know, and
"full-ass" it?

301
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,968
Yeah.
Really give it a go?

302
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,648
Be the greatest manager in the history
of this branch and in that way,

303
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,963
achieve the fame and immortality
that you seek? Mmm?

304
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,207
No, I like my plan better.

305
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,171
Well, Andy,
your plan sucks, okay?

306
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,130
Nobody is going
to hire you ever.

307
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,050
You're too character-y
to be a lead,

308
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,044
and you're not fat enough to
be a great character actor.

309
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,604
What?

310
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,251
No, I don't think
he can make it as an actor.

311
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,849
But he also can't make it
as an employee in an office,

312
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,890
so, you know,
why not go nuts with it?

313
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,810
Hey, are you still
in charge of office supplies?

314
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,483
Yes. Yeah.
You are?

315
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,722
I seem to have
a sticky note emergency,

316
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,609
where I grab it
on the wrong end,

317
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,886
and then, this happens.

318
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,961
Oh, boy, um...

319
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,281
If you could help me out,
that would be...

320
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,131
I could give you
some beginner stickies.

321
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,565
Anything would help.
Thank you. Okay.

322
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,846
Here you go.

323
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,081
Also, while you're at it,

324
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,970
if you did have a salt packet,
three tacks and some aspirin,

325
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,246
that'd be great.

326
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,402
Wow. You have that.
Mmm-hmm.

327
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,447
Wow, that's...

328
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,521
It's all yours.

329
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,762
You come so prepared.

330
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,769
Aspirin.

331
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,201
If you want to get rid of a headache,
you sit on something sharp.

332
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,362
Any sensei will tell you that.

333
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,324
Hey, congratulations
on that black belt, man.

334
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,245
It's really great.

335
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,566
Thank you.

336
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,801
So I saw you talking
to Wallace earlier.

337
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,484
Is he going to offer
you the manager's job?

338
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,846
No.

339
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,483
He was maybe
thinking of you for it.

340
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,005
Yeah, right.

341
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,523
I'm afraid
that ship has sailed.

342
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,490
I wouldn't be
too sure about that.

343
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,925
Just saying.

344
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,441
Hello.

345
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,726
Well, hello.

346
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,881
Big day for you.

347
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,325
Big day for you.
Thank you.

348
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,129
Love the belt.
Yes.

349
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,646
You know, I don't know
anything about karate,

350
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,404
but I have broken
a few boards in my day.

351
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,567
Hiya!

352
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,610
Diving boards at my
family pool in Redding.

353
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,960
I was an obese child.

354
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,441
I never talk
about that here,

355
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,126
but Nard-Dog's outta here,
so lettin' it all hang out.

356
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,361
This is exciting.

357
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,568
You're finally gonna get
to go out and flap your wings.

358
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,563
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

359
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,688
'Cause a lot of people are
saying I might not make it.

360
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,000
I doubt you'll make it.

361
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,567
Very few do
who try to be a star.

362
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,723
But listen, you've saved up enough
money to take a couple of years off,

363
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,167
and pursue your dream
and have some fun, right?

364
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,449
No, I just applied for
more overdraft protection.

365
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,962
Andy, I have nothing to gain
from getting you to stay,

366
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,769
and everything to gain
from you leaving.

367
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,605
But please, I have known you for years.
I have seen you perform.

368
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,082
Dear God, don't quit
your dayjob.

369
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,927
Nothing is
impossible to him who will try.

370
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,401
Alexander the
Great, if he were Cockney.

371
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,046
You're bad.

372
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,768
I'm gonna make it.

373
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,524
Every person
who's been on Conan

374
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,409
has a crazy story
about how they made it.

375
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,885
Every person.

376
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,285
Erin.

377
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,206
Honest Erin.
Cannot tell a lie.

378
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,884
We lay together.

379
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,928
That's something
you can't take back.

380
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,884
So true.

381
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,725
Is there a question,
or are... What?

382
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,040
Will you tell me bluntly,

383
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,487
do you think I'm making
a terrible mistake

384
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,130
quitting my job
to become an actor?

385
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,887
Bluntly? Yes.

386
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,485
Huge mistake.

387
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,042
Andy, honestly, I think
you might become homeless

388
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,690
or maybe even starve.

389
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,926
Thank you.

390
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,329
You can stay on
as a salesman, Andy.

391
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,561
Thank you.

392
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,248
Dwight, could you come in
here for a second, please?

393
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,204
Say it again.

394
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,051
Will you be
the new manager?

395
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,131
Where?

396
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,409
Where?
What branch?

397
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,209
Here. Scranton.

398
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,930
Come on.

399
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,287
Come on, Dwight. Get up.

400
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,250
Let's go. It's good news.

401
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,810
I'm sorry.

402
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,164
I've just waited for this
moment my entire life.

403
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,210
I mean, I was interim manager
once, but then I shot that gun.

404
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,361
What?

405
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,643
But this isn't
interim manager.

406
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,881
No.

407
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,609
It's Dwight K. Schrute...

408
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,164
Manager.

409
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,651
Why do you
already have this?

410
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,121
In case Michael or Andy ever got
killed in a traffic accident

411
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,123
and there was a trade
show on the same day.

412
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,441
You will not regret
this decision, David.

413
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,767
I know.

414
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,487
I will never,
ever let you down.

415
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,369
I know, Dwight.

416
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,206
I know.

417
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,210
Okay-

418
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,040
Okay. All right. You're gonna do great.

419
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,809
Hey.
Wow, hey.

420
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,370
Hi.

421
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,530
What's up?

422
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,681
I have a question.

423
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,807
Okay-

424
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,041
I had a question.

425
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,446
Really?

426
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,361
I did!

427
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,646
Yeah, totally you did.

428
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,131
Super important.

429
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,282
I need you to stay right here
while you think about it.

430
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,407
Okay. All right? I'm gonna wait.

431
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,521
All right.

432
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,529
I did not come back
here just to see you.

433
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,682
No, I'm sure
you did not.

434
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,371
What was
yourquesflon?

435
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,646
I don't know,

436
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,563
but it might take me a long
time to figure it out.

437
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,971
Well, then,
I should figure out

438
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,405
things to do
while I'm waiting.

439
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,811
Exactly.

440
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,641
Hey, everybody.
I changed my mind.

441
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,163
Not leaving. I'm gonna
stay on in sales.

442
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,163
Oh! Thank God...

443
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,442
Because sales could
be your best role yet.

444
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,049
Hey. Good choice,
man. Seriously.

445
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,043
Don't wanna see you
in a porn next year.

446
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,360
Okay-

447
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,250
Ooh! There's a great play
about a salesman.

448
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,731
Death of a Salesman.

449
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,206
I don't think so.

450
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,487
Sure, Death of a Salesman
by Arthur Miller.

451
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,967
- It's a great play about crushed dreams.
- Mmm.

452
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,809
No, this one was written
by SpongeBob SquarePants.

453
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,090
Got any hot leads?

454
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,968
See, so you just push from under
and turn it around, and boom.

455
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,288
Now, the staple
crimps outward.

456
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,441
I had no idea.

457
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,807
And here, I've been stapling
the same way for 20 years

458
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,211
like a frickin' sheep.

459
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,884
Look who's back.
I'm back.

460
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,522
Hey, look, and now,
it's like a double date.

461
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,088
Wow. 'Cause...

462
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,168
Bup-bup!
Widdle-de-doo.

463
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,567
Actually, maybe we should go
on a double date sometime.

464
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,971
That'd be fun.

465
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,565
Yeah, we should do that
for real sometime.

466
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,802
Well, how about
Thursday?

467
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,406
Well, Thursday's tough
because“.

468
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,646
Weeknights are actually
tough just because...

469
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,801
They are.
That's true, yeah.

470
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,406
Just forget it.
Forget I said anything.

471
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,570
What?

472
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,931
Attention, everyone.
Just a quick announcement.

473
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,367
Little reconfiguration
to the staff.

474
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,801
Dwight Schrute...

475
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,927
David.

476
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,001
Can I just do one thing while
you're making this announcement?

477
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,969
And then, I'll never,
ever do it again.

478
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,525
I don't think so. But
it's just one thing.

479
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,250
Just let me... Let me do this...
Dwight... Dwight...

480
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,362
Come on... What I was
about to say is Dwight...

481
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,601
I'm sorry, I gotta...
This'll be a second, sorry.

482
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,284
Just wait and send
it to voice mail.

483
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,325
Yeah.

484
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,726
Uh...

485
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,530
Come on.

486
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,005
Then we'll get him
a new set of drums.

487
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,081
Oh, my God.

488
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,963
Oh, my God.

489
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:54,324
Dwight Schrute is manager!

490
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,202
Yeah!

491
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,328
B rava. B rava.

492
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,129
Way to go, Dwight.
Whoo!

493
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,171
Creed Bratton is
the new manager!

494
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,365
Congrats.

495
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,487
What's going on?

496
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,642
Dwight's the new manager.

497
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,046
He freaking did it.

498
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,849
Congratulations, Dwight.

499
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,970
Pam.

500
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,724
Congratulations, buddy.

501
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,521
Thank you, Jim.

502
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,681
Congrats, Dwight.

503
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,965
Get out of Jim's seat.

504
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,931
But I fought for this seat.

505
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,445
You're an annex kid.

506
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,761
You might be bullpen. We'll see.
Give it a couple years.

507
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,120
Scram.

508
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,723
It's nice to have you back.

509
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,249
So...
So...

510
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,641
I wanted to offer
you a new position.

511
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,926
Let's hear it.

512
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,480
Assistant regional manager.

513
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,325
Nope. Can't accept
that job.

514
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,447
It's not a real job.

515
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,487
Jim.

516
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,483
I'll tell you
what I could accept

517
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,166
is assistant
to the regional manager.

518
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,641
That is a real job, and
one I'd be proud to take.

519
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,649
Shake on it?

520
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,322
Done. Way
to negotiate, idiot.

521
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,969
Don't get me wrong.
lam definitely here for Pam.

522
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,765
But this is
an awesome added bonus.

523
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,731
So, all the numbers
adding up?

524
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,965
Hey, I didn't get a chance to say
it, but, congratulations, Dwight.

525
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,121
Thank you.

526
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,521
Yes, congratulations.

527
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,080
Yeah, and, Dwight, I'd like
to be the first to say

528
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,844
congratulations.

529
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,129
This is a big day for you.

530
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,126
Hmm.

531
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,484
Yes, it is.

532
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,210
Carry on.

533
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,451
How did I just abandon
my dream so quickly?

534
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,968
It's 'cause I had a fallback.
That's the problem.

535
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,089
When you have fallbacks,
it's just easy to give up.

536
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,969
When Cortés
landed in Mexico,

537
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,247
only way he got his
men to defeat the Aztecs

538
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,522
was by burning
all of his own boats

539
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,608
so they could
never return home.

540
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,721
Huge dick move,

541
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,928
but very effective.

542
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,486
I need to be that same
kind of dick to myself.

543
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,524
Everyone!

544
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,647
Changed my mind again.

545
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,721
Which is it now?

546
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,921
Dream or no dream?

547
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,081
Uh, dream.

548
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,924
Goin' with my dream.

549
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,082
Gotta go all in.
Ain't that right, Jim?

550
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,164
Oh. Don't look at me, 'cause I think
you're making a terrible choice.

551
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,322
All in! Whoo!

552
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,446
Toby!

553
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,727
Hey. I changed my mind again.

554
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,088
I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin
to pursue acting after all.

555
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,605
Okay, then, Andy.
Yeah.

556
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,761
But here's the thing.

557
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,484
I can't have good old Dunder
Mifflin to fall back on,

558
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,766
or else I'll never succeed.

559
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,126
Gotta burn those boats!

560
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,850
So I need you
to go into my file

561
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,968
and put down that
I was fired for theft

562
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,247
and/or groping wieners.

563
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,245
Andy, you know
I can't do that.

564
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,322
It'd be lying.
Seriously?

565
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,447
Yeah, I'm...

566
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,045
Come on, just do it.

567
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,726
I can't.

568
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,165
All right, fine.

569
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,687
Just know that
you made me do this.

570
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,403
Come on. Andy, no.

571
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,285
God, Toby, don't...
Stop blocking my hand.

572
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,441
No, no.

573
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,965
This is your...
You brought this on.

574
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,326
No, no. Andy.

575
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,041
Okay, all right. Groped you good.
Off to Hollywood!

576
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,529
This is Angela.

577
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,964
Hello, Miss Polodnikovski.

578
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,602
How can I help you?

579
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,603
Did my rent check
not clear?

580
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,969
Because I just transferred
another $25 to that account.

581
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,486
So if there's a problem, it's
clearly on your end. And...

582
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,205
Oh. Oh!

583
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,843
Oh, okay. Good.

584
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,843
Then what is this about?

585
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,127
No, no. Hey, hey.

586
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,168
No, you are out of line,
Miss Polodnikovski.

587
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,046
No. No, you are.
No, you are!

588
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,525
Evicted? Fine!

589
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,682
I don't want to live in that
cesspool anyway.

590
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,242
Listen, I get my security deposit back.
Yes, I do.

591
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,363
That is not fair!
That is not fair!

592
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,521
Well, you know what?

593
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,364
You have so many
hairs on your chin,

594
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,522
Animal Control
should've taken you away.

595
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,002
That is very unladylike.
You are disgusting!

596
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,483
What do you think
that was about?

597
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,000
David.

598
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,650
I lost the Scranton
White Pages account.

599
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,848
Do you have any idea
how much paper that is?

600
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,611
And I'd just like to point
out I was mad at Dwight.

601
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,886
I did it out of spite.

602
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,042
We put the past
behind us, though, Andy.

603
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,168
What if I told you
I hate you and this company?

604
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,651
Enough, Andy. Enough!

605
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,327
Just stop forgiving me,
David. Please?

606
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,246
This is my last chance to honor
what is best inside myself.

607
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,402
What if I took a dump
on your new car?

608
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,447
Oh, my God.

609
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,443
Eleanor Roosevelt once said,

610
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,963
"The future belongs to those who believe
in the beauty of their dreams."

611
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,688
I think she's right.

612
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,761
I feel calm now.

613
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,161
Get out!

614
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,842
I feel like for
the first time in a long time,

615
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,283
I'm doing the right thing.

616
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,004
Andy.
Yeah.

617
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,485
What are you doing?

618
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,845
Heavy stuff like
books on the bottom.

619
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,689
So I don't squash
my knickety-knacks on top.

620
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,683
Yeah, okay,
that's not what I mean.

621
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,010
You don't have to leave
because you said you would.

622
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,687
Don't let pride
ruin your whole life.

623
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,523
Okay? It's not worth it.

624
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,727
Wow!

625
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,331
Angela.

626
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,088
What we had was great, and, honestly,
I think about it a lot, too.

627
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,090
Ugh. But I just...
It's in the past.

628
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,009
And I feel like we shouldn't...
No, that's not...

629
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,081
...rehash...

630
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,440
No, none... No, stop.

631
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,090
It's just...

632
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,242
Exactly.
Okay.

633
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,085
Well, have a good trip.

634
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,565
Good luck, Andy.

635
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,364
Thanks, Angela. You, too.

636
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,441
Thanks.

637
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,849
A bridge a-burnt.

638
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,888
No turning back now.

639
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:21,047
Everybody, Lorelei and I would
like to say thank you and good-bye

640
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,360
the only way we know how.

641
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,521
Good lord.

642
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,443
Can't you just leave?

643
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,524
You know, Andy, you could just
say a really nice good-bye.

644
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,683
Tuna, I'm a performer,
and perform I shall.

645
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,206
You Okay?

646
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,891
It's just
a really nice song.

647
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,121
Awesome.

648
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,005
Nice!

649
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,205
Thanks, Meredith.

650
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,724
Who knows?
Maybe Andy will make it.

651
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,086
He's not terrible.

652
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,127
STANLEY'. Yeah.

653
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,123
And people worse than him
make it all the time,

654
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,565
like Lil' Romeo.

655
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,641
No, he's good.

656
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,449
He was good.

657
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,401
Good night, Kevin.

658
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,527
Night, Oscar.

659
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,085
Tents?

660
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,603
Are you thinking
of going camping?

661
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,887
I thought you found
nature vulgar.

662
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,645
Well, I've changed
my mind.

663
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,089
Wait
a minute, Angela.

664
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,289
You're not thinking
of living in a tent...

665
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,125
God, would you just mind
your own business?

666
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,609
Okay, listen.
I'm just gonna say this.

667
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,048
You are not going
to live in a tent.

668
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,246
Oh, God.

669
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,246
Come stay with me.

670
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,443
You don't want me
at your place.

671
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,405
I do. Yes.

672
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,007
Not forever, but until you
get back on your feet,

673
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,880
which won't be long.
It's the least I can do.

674
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,291
Well...

675
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,524
Separate bathrooms.

676
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,330
Thank you.

677
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,205
You're welcome.

678
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,805
Let's go get Phillip.

679
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,405
Then, we'll get
your stuff...

680
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,481
Okay-

681
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,289
And you get the hell
out of that place.

682
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,165
Okay-

683
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,843
Are you allowed
to have pets?

684
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,166
Oh, Angela.

685
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,922
Yesterday, I was just your
average, ordinary paper salesman

686
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,844
with a farm and a bunch of
pipe dreams about beet fuel.

687
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,486
Today, I leave here a regional
manager with a black belt.

688
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,402
It really is amazing how your
life can change in one day.

689
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,441
You talk to Wade
and Colin?

690
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,522
No, I just saw I missed their call.
Why? What's up?

691
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,931
We got an offer
on the table.

692
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,968
What kind of offer?
A buyout.

693
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,371
What?
We're in play, baby.

694
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,169
Oh, my God.
We did it.

695
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,765
We did it!

696
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,285
Hey, and look.

697
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,169
The buyers wanna make sure
it's not just a Philly play.

698
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,208
Okay.
So get this.

699
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,206
They're gonna pay for us
to go pitch out west.

700
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,490
We're talking Spurs,
the Jazz, Cowboys.

701
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,881
Blake Griffin, baby.

702
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,041
Wow, that is...

703
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,121
Yeah.

704
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,043
Wow.
We did it.

705
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,724
Yeah, we did it.

706
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,802
Hey, how long do they
think that's gonna take?

707
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,850
Wade said we could do the whole
country in three months.

708
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,490
Oh, man.

709
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,405
Yeah, I can't do it.

710
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,891
Can't do what?

711
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,805
This, man. I can't
do this to Pam.

712
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,962
No, no.
Jim, this is different.

713
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,809
This is everything.

714
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,370
I know.

715
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,322
And I can't do it.

716
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,485
So is your place all
bachelor, slobby and gross?

717
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,843
Nope, it's neat and tastefully
appointed, like most gay men's homes.

718
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,649
The stereotype
holds up.

719
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,525
I wouldn't know.
lneverhved with a gay guy.

720
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,287
Angela, you just were...

721
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,290
I love him.

722
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,281
I know.

723
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,366
I understand more than most,
but we both have to move on.

724
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,444
You can't...

725
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,890
No, not the Senator.

726
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,689
I love Dwight.
