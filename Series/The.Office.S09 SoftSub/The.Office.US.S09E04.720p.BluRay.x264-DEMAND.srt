1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,682
All right, everybody,
great season of softball.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,125
I'm super proud
of you guys,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,043
and I think you're
going to like this

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,929
little highlight reel
that I've put together.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,324
GROUP". Dunder Mifflin!

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,926
ANDY". Andy Bernard presents,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,287
"Summer Softball Epic Fails!"

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,441
Fail.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,241
Fail!
That's me!

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,965
Fail. Is this like
a blooper reel?

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,566
A blooper reel?
What is this, 2005?

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,247
Do I look like
Bob Saget? Fail!

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,081
Who's this guy?

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,530
♪ Meow, meow, meow, meow.

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,205
Look at him dance!

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,884
Fail!
Fail.

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,610
I deserved that.

18
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,045
Do-dee-do-dee-do

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,360
That was a triple.

20
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,250
Can't take the fail?
Get out of the fail video!

21
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,401
My pleasure.

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,326
Hi, I'm Pete!
Puberty is such a drag, man.

23
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,725
And I'm Clark, I like to
eat toilet paper. We fail!

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,644
I'd like to take a solemn
moment to remember

25
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,245
Jerry in the warehouse,

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,364
who passed away this year.

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,125
Well, that's all, folks!

28
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,008
Ski you later, everybody! Thanks for
a great season.

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,482
What was that? That was just normal
video with you making vulgar noises.

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,404
Well, I worked with
what I had, Oscar.

31
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,882
Next time do more
fail-ier stuff, okay?

32
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,044
What happened to
that video I sent you?

33
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,488
Oh, that wasn't... That didn't work.
That was not the right...

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,568
I think
I've got it right here.

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,005
No.

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,645
Oh!

37
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,441
That was not a fail!

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,487
Fail! Fail! Fail!

39
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,641
That was actually
a serious accident

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,529
that could have resulted
in severe bodily harm.

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,324
Fail! Fail! Fail!
You're all failing right now.

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,200
Congratulations on your epic fail
of the use of the word "fail!"

43
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,201
Oh, God.

44
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,767
What's going on?

45
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,086
Nothing!
Nothing is going on.

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,850
Keep moving, please.
What's he measuring?

47
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,400
Okay, excuse me,
lam the landlord.

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,927
This is between me and the
management, no one else. Please.

49
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,964
It's an EMF hotspot.
Oh, my God!

50
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,526
It stands for
electromagnetic field,

51
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,284
generally caused
by a concentration

52
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,885
of wiring in one area,

53
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,131
especially if
poorly insulated, Dwight.

54
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,641
Um.

55
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,722
Okay, I'm just
walking in to this.

56
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,770
Am I to understand there's
a beehive in the wall?

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,521
You think I have a machine
for measuring beehives?

58
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,409
I was just asking
a question, Toby.

59
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,845
How are you not
murdered every hour?

60
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,331
Well, I'm not getting paid
to work in a microwave oven.

61
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,644
Okay, listen.
Everything here is up to code.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,207
"Oh, the wires
need insulation."

63
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,604
It's a wire, people.
I'm not buying it a fur coat.

64
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,086
Thank you.
You got it.

65
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,290
Last week, I finally told Pam
about the other job I took in Philly,

66
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,684
the side job, and she was so
incredibly cool about it.

67
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,971
And now I just want to do
something huge for her.

68
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,129
Like if we were
in some biker bar

69
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,043
and she mouthed
off to some bikers

70
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,885
and they came lumbering over
and I was like... Wham!

71
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,962
"You've got to go
through me first!"

72
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,491
Andy, could I have
a word, please?

73
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,881
It won't take a moment,
it's extremely important,

74
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,281
and it really
has to happen now.

75
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,802
Fine. I will
give you one minute.

76
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,485
Oh, please don't
use the hourglass.

77
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,688
You have one minute
and your minute has begun,

78
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,762
and no time will
be added at the end,

79
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,644
even to accommodate
this sentence,

80
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,451
with all of its
baroque dependent clauses

81
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,161
and cascading
turns of phrase.

82
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,569
I'm trying
to adopt a baby.

83
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,846
A baby what?

84
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,041
A human?

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,686
And the agency requires a character
reference from my employer.

86
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,121
Oh.

87
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,402
You wouldn't have to do anything.
I'd write the letter myself.

88
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,970
You'd just simply
sign it. So...

89
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,681
Okay-

90
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,805
And fall right into your
plagiarism entrapment scheme?

91
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,850
I don't think so.
It's... No, it's...

92
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,685
And I happen to notice you're
down to about 30 seconds here.

93
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,841
If I could just
convince you that you...

94
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,046
And those sand grains are

95
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,963
tumbling with
fury down the side...

96
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,246
It's not entrapment

97
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,810
if I'm writing...
...of the hourglass.

98
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,723
Time's up!
Fine.

99
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,691
Sure, I'll read
her letter.

100
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,009
And if she tells the truth
about how evil and unfit

101
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,731
to be a mother she is, then,
yeah, I'll sign that.

102
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,211
"Statistical correlations
exist between EMF

103
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,681
"radiation and
various health hazards,

104
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,409
"but mainstream
studies are inconclusive."

105
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,041
That means you
can't make me do squat.

106
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,361
You better fix this!

107
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,609
I already ditched my uterus, and I
ain't losing any more good parts!

108
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,091
You people don't
realize what you're asking.

109
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,844
I'd have to rip
open the walls.

110
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,082
We'd have to shut this
place down for a week.

111
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,290
A week off,
that'd be great.

112
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,326
Hey, if you don't want to teach
me the PowerPoint, just say so.

113
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,481
I don't want to
teach you PowerPoint.

114
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,561
Come on.

115
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,131
Just show me the PowerPoint.

116
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,167
Just do the tutorial!

117
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,287
You're the tutorial.

118
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,727
No, dude, I'm not.
I'm not the tutorial.

119
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,365
You could be.
Mmm-mmm.

120
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,524
What are you doing?

121
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,170
Getting my wife
a week off from work.

122
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,761
You popped one kernel.

123
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,731
Awesome, right?

124
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,722
So Creed is that
dude's stepdad?

125
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,366
Correct.

126
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,922
Well, I don't know about the rest of
you, but I'm just going to say it.

127
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,600
I'm nervous.
I have no idea what

128
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,444
health problems this
is all going to cause.

129
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,881
What? Come on.

130
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,049
I'm sorry.
I'm not growing a third arm.

131
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,810
I know what Jim
is trying to do.

132
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,285
He's trying to
get Big Bad Dwight

133
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,850
to shell out for
a huge repairjob

134
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,088
while lucky Jimbo
gets a paid vacation.

135
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,889
Well, sorry, lucky Jimbo.

136
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,201
I can live very
happily in a magnetic field.

137
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,931
Most of my childhood heroes
got their powers that way.

138
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,360
"Side effects of EMF
include headaches."

139
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,720
Had them all my life.

140
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,484
"Breast pain."

141
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,767
No knobbies, no probbies.
Nice try, Jim.

142
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,491
O01'. "infertility."

143
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,321
Yeah, right.

144
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,801
Ah.

145
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,281
There's my popcorn.
Can you just grab that for me?

146
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,967
Keep your snacks on
your side, Jim, idiot.

147
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,211
What the...
What?

148
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,161
Some of these
kernels have crowned.

149
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,329
That's impossible, becausethafs
a brand-new bag...

150
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,730
Oh, my God.

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,081
Andy!

152
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,724
I'm going to drive
you up to the lake.

153
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,883
Give you a whole week on the
water, just you, me and the kids.

154
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,923
Can we stop by that
pie stand on the way?

155
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,527
You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also?
Yes, we will be doing that.

156
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,726
We'll be getting a dozen.

157
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,928
A dozen different pies?
'Cause that means rhubarb.

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,446
Why would you say that? I meant
four apple, four blueberry,

159
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,205
two cherry, one peach, one chocolate.
I thought that was implied.

160
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,486
Yeah, okay, then.

161
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,047
Ladies and gentlemen!
I have heard your complaints

162
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,248
and we reached
a settlement.

163
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,048
So, we will be leaving the
office for one whole week.

164
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,441
Nice job.

165
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,129
In my contract
it is stipulated

166
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,248
that I provide
a temporary workspace.

167
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,322
It will arrive in one hour.
What?

168
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,130
What's this?
Whoa. What?

169
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,407
Bring it in.

170
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,086
Roll into
the future with Work Bus.

171
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,885
Say goodbye to
wasteful buildings.

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,209
These days a mobile office
isn'tjust for hotshot politicians.

173
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,328
Now anyone can
rent a work bus.

174
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,121
If you've got a parking lot, a work
space is just a phone call away.

175
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,602
In this age of belt-tightening
and less empowered workers,

176
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,122
a work bus is how tomorrow
gets things done.

177
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,646
They're a hundred pack...

178
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,484
No six pack for me.

179
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,765
Six. Yes.

180
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,371
Sorry.
Oh, my God!

181
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,201
Ah! Sorry.
Lose weight!

182
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,210
I'm trying, sorry.

183
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,571
Oh, The Pennsylvania Department of
Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard.

184
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,927
Oh, of course,
you were adopted.

185
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,841
I wish!
No, I made some short lists,

186
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,843
I had a couple of sleepovers,
but I never

187
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,928
managed to get
in the end zone.

188
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,646
I don't know what it was.

189
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,001
Not loveable, maybe.
Oh, well.

190
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,130
Listen, I'm really
struggling with this form.

191
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,044
But as you know the system, do
you think maybe you could...

192
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,168
Absolutely. I know exactly
what they want to hear.

193
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,526
I would love to help.

194
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,807
Oh, thank you so much!

195
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,721
Just, don't tell Andy,
because“.

196
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,723
He hates me.
Thinks I'm a monster.

197
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,643
Should go back to Loch Ness.

198
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,006
Stretch. All right.

199
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,411
How many times do you
need to take a stroll?

200
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,490
I... My legs cramp up, okay?
It's a circulation issue.

201
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,289
Boy, I will hammerspank
your rear.

202
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,840
All right, all right, gang.
Let's just settle down.

203
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,001
You're yelling in her face.

204
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,326
It's a medical thing.

205
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,771
Just... We good?

206
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,245
I'm good! All right?

207
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,285
I'm so sorry
for all of this.

208
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,766
It's okay. You know what they say,
a change is as good as a rest.

209
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,929
I need to get
to the paper, please.

210
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,961
Oh, God!
Oh!

211
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,963
Ah! Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

212
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,087
All right,
I'll get you a napkin.

213
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,241
Can someone get
napkins, please?

214
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,130
You know what? It's fine. It's fine.
Let me just... It's fine.

215
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,168
Pam, I'm really sorry.
I just...

216
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,928
I'm... I'm really
sorry about all that.

217
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,841
Really? Smirking?

218
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,769
What can I say?
I love justice.

219
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,763
You forced me to spend money
on needless repairs.

220
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,729
And now you're
locked in a prison bus

221
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,768
and your woman
drips with beverage.

222
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,207
Hey, Dwight, I was trying to
do something nice for Pam.

223
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,123
Can you just help me out?

224
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,202
Can we maybe take
this thing somewhere?

225
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,931
Or do something to not make
this the worst day ever?

226
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,321
It's not my responsibility to
solve your marriage problems

227
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,244
by spending my money on gas.

228
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,441
Andy!

229
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,846
Yo, Toonces.

230
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,001
You're the boss.
Don't you think

231
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,127
we'd all be
a lot more productive

232
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,567
if while we were doing work,
we looked up and saw

233
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,166
the best rural pie
stand in Pennsylvania?

234
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,480
I know
I'd be more productive.

235
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,806
As would I.

236
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,881
No question.

237
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,327
No, no,
this is a work bus.

238
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,243
The wheels are
for transporting

239
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,203
the work space to
and from the work site.

240
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,441
What are you talking about?

241
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,727
You're not the boss.
Andy is. Andy?

242
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,610
Pies!
Pies! Pies! Pies! Pies! Pies!

243
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,406
All right!
The fat people have spoken!

244
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,922
Dwight,
get this bus moving.

245
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,242
Next stop, Laverne's
Pies Tires Fixed Also!

246
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,163
Oh, yes!

247
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,480
So it looks like this work bus was
a pretty good idea after all, huh?

248
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,165
Get your foot
behind the yellow line.

249
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,765
You got it.

250
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,011
Stop.
Come back.

251
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,320
Too late.
Hmm.

252
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,522
Shabooya roll call! Shabooya
yaya, shabooya roll call!

253
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,204
My name is Pam
Yeah?

254
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,884
I like to paint
Yeah?

255
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,405
You think you're better?
Yeah?

256
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,481
Oh, no, you ain't!

257
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,561
Roll call!

258
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,729
Shabooya yaya
Shabooya roll call!

259
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,123
Shabooya yaya
Shabooya roll call!

260
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,810
My name is Kevin
Yeah?

261
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,365
That is my name
Yeah?

262
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,403
They call me Kevin
Yeah?

263
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,527
'Cause that's my name

264
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,601
Roll call!

265
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,889
Shabooya yaya
Shabooya roll call!

266
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,329
Shabooya yaya
Shabooya roll call!

267
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,205
Thanks. Playing a little
hookey from work today.

268
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,651
Oh, my God!

269
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,211
Dunder Mifflin
road trip 2012!

270
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,931
Okay, now a serious one.

271
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,289
Hey, where's Dwight?
He should be a part of this.

272
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,683
Has he been acting kind
of weird to you lately?

273
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,400
If by lately you mean
for the last 12 years, yeah.

274
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,084
No, I mean he's sulking.
That's not like him.

275
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,844
He's just mad that
we're all having fun.

276
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,886
Then why isn't he scheming?
Or preparing to avenge?

277
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,847
He's fine.
He's indestructible.

278
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,928
Always say that
a child is "placed"

279
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,281
for adoption,
never "surrendered."

280
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,206
We're not hostages.

281
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,362
Although, I have
considered kidnapping one.

282
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,361
And never say that.

283
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,647
I am so excited thinking about this
child that you're going to adopt.

284
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,768
I wish I could just
wave a magic wand and

285
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,968
make you a parentless
five-year-old again.

286
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,485
I would snap you up.

287
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,841
Oh.

288
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,924
Next stop, pies.
Next stop, pies.

289
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,050
Next stop, pies.
Next stop, pies.

290
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,209
Let's go, driver.

291
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,409
Laverne packs up
the pie wagon at 5:00, so...

292
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,007
At 5:00? That's only
20 minutes from now.

293
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,411
The pie shop
is 13 miles away.

294
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,925
So at 55 miles an hour, that just
gives us five minutes to spare!

295
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,009
So, wait.
When pies are involved

296
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,048
you can suddenly do
math in your head?

297
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,121
Well...

298
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,206
Hold on, Kevin,
how much is 19,154 pies

299
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,249
divided by 61 pies?

300
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,168
Three hundred
and fourteen pies.

301
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,410
What if it were salads?

302
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,325
Well, it's the...

303
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,245
Carry the four...
In the...

304
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,725
It doesn't work.

305
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,207
I'm sorry to spoil Jim's
fantastic voyage, everyone.

306
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,520
But we're
almost out of gas.

307
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,963
Okay, well, I saw a station about
a mile back, so chop-chop.

308
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,641
That name brand place?
No, forget about it, sorry.

309
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,803
The tanks are so big on this
thing, five cents a gallon extra?

310
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,961
It really adds up.

311
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,242
Are you kidding me?
Dwight, come on!

312
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,169
Hey, honey? I don't think
we should push him.

313
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,163
No, I'm going to push him.
You know why?

314
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,891
Because you're getting a pie.
Why? Because you deserve it!

315
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,531
And what is he doing? He's trying to
drive us all around the countryside

316
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,881
looking for gas, because he
knows we won't get there.

317
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,803
- Is that what we want?
- No!

318
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,929
Stop ordering
me around, Jim!

319
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,804
- What do we want?
- Pies!

320
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,644
- When do we want it?
- Pies!

321
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,161
Okay, fine!

322
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,128
You win, Jim! You win.

323
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,288
We have been battling for a
long time, but you know what?

324
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,567
You win, because you are the winner.
You are the alpha male.

325
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,325
There you go. Alpha male,
go buy your wife a pie.

326
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,970
Go buy the whole
world a pie!

327
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,645
That's impossible.

328
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,166
Dwight!

329
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,321
What are you doing?

330
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,005
What the hell?
Dwight!

331
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,287
Well, now I don't
even feel like pie.

332
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,481
Wait.

333
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,005
No, it's back.

334
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,086
Oh, just drive away. Just...

335
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,685
Phyllis, that's not safe.

336
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,842
Guys, we only have
18 minutes left.

337
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,004
At 61 miles an hour, we're
just going to barely make it.

338
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,085
Go up and check on him.
He's upset.

339
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,810
You know he's doing
all this on purpose.

340
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,247
Please just make
sure he's okay.

341
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,771
And hurry it up,
for God's sake!

342
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,285
They're going to be
out of banana cream.

343
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,486
Banana cream is
the first to go.

344
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,528
We'll be lucky to get
pumpkin at this point.

345
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,841
What?

346
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,241
Dwight?

347
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,451
Why are you such a jerk?

348
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,363
I'm trying to do
something for my wife,

349
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,521
and you keep derailing...

350
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,886
I'm barren, Jim.

351
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,527
What? My trouser hives
are void of honey.

352
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,089
I had congress with Angela,
and the child that she bore

353
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,810
did not issue
from my loins.

354
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,363
I thought I would be a father
and instead I am a eunuch,

355
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,884
neutered by my own building.

356
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,045
Is this about the popcorn,
or the X on the ceiling?

357
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,404
Dwight,
that was a prank.

358
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,006
You mean you flooded my building
with dangerous electromagnetic

359
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,287
radiation as a prank?
No.

360
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,328
That's genius. That's the
best prank you've ever done.

361
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,890
Ru take it.

362
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,921
Andy?
Who is it?

363
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,362
Um, is this a good time?
Yeah.

364
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,762
Perfect time, right in the
middle of a rooftop crisis.

365
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,968
Fine, let me read it.
What do we have here?

366
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,130
Okay.

367
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,604
You've made this very easy for me.
It's unsignable.

368
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,241
Oh.

369
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,925
Well, is there something...
It's inaccurate, dishonest,

370
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,122
and in a word, dong water.

371
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,008
Oh, well, perhaps I could
reword some of it to...

372
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,082
Here's the thing. You asked
me to do you a favor.

373
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,964
I did it. I read it.

374
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,281
Thank you very much
to me for my time.

375
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,762
Good luck with
your impossible dream.

376
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,770
All right then.

377
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,800
Dwight, sometimes it takes
couples years to get pregnant.

378
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,406
Really? How long did it take
you and Pam to conceive?

379
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,409
That doesn't matter. What
position did you use to conceive?

380
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,567
Okay, I'm not
talking about that.

381
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,687
Regular or
lady-on-her-back?

382
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,683
You used lady-on-her-back,
didn't you, freak?

383
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,485
Yuck, gross.
Never mind, Jim.

384
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,722
British women, famously
over-emotional, am I right?

385
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,482
I don't think that's Nellie.
What?

386
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,721
NELLIEI Oh.

387
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,965
Oh, no, no. Look, it's all right, really.
It isn't your fault.

388
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,367
No, no.
You were so kind,

389
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,410
and it isn't
anything to do with you.

390
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,691
Did you ever think that
because you own the building,

391
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,082
everyone in it, we're all
kind of like your children?

392
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,525
You know there's a phrase about
that in German, bildenkinder,

393
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,051
used almost
exclusively by childless

394
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,849
landlords to
console themselves.

395
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,890
But now I really
understand it.

396
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,723
Well, now you have a bus full
of real bildenkinder.

397
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,128
Bildenkinder. Okay, and
they're all dangerously close

398
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,690
to not getting pie.

399
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,161
And there's only one
guy who can save them.

400
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,004
It's not me.

401
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,161
I agree.

402
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,327
Oh.

403
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,725
Hey, how did it go?

404
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,280
It was pretty good, actually.
We bonded, we got to talk...

405
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,841
Oh. Wait, wait, wait!

406
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,969
That's what happens when
you don't get out of the way.

407
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,246
Out of the way!

408
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,289
You feel okay now?
Better than okay.

409
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,765
And you know what, honey?

410
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,888
I'm going to get
you that rhubarb pie.

411
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,201
Well, actually, rhubarb is...
Don't.

412
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,321
...the one pie that I...
Don't.

413
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,050
Everybody, hang on!

414
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,401
Oh!

415
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,650
Whoa!

416
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,962
Pie! Pie! Pie! Pie! Pie!

417
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,801
Oh.

418
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,526
I changed my mind.

419
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,884
Oh, you signed it?
Yeah.

420
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,203
Not as is, obviously.

421
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,090
I made a couple of changes, added
some sentences at the end.

422
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,125
Trust me, it needed it.

423
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,851
But, yeah, whatever.

424
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,569
"She's tough in business, but tender
with the people she cares about.

425
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,881
"She'll make a wonderful
mother to any child

426
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,167
"who can
overlook weird accents."

427
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,122
I insult you, Oscar!

428
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,766
What?

429
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,730
I insult you,
to your face!

430
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,681
I don't know what
you're talking about.

431
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,047
Then why don't you
do something about it?

432
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,567
Kevin, are you
trying to get me

433
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,449
to hit you in
the face with my pie?

434
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,370
You don't have the guts,

435
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,608
you stupid,
dumb do-do face.

436
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,641
Yes!

437
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,127
Oh, my God,
I'm getting so stuffed.

438
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,765
We did it.

439
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,691
You did it.

440
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,443
My name is Andy!
Yeah?

441
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,488
I don't do drugs
Yeah?

442
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,483
Now check the style
Yeah?

443
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,686
Of Flatt and Scruggs!

444
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,841
Yeah

445
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,611
Roll call

446
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,681
What?
