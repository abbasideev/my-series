1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,882
Andy's coming back today.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,605
Andy's coming back today.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,565
Andy's
coming back today.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,008
David Wallace sent him on an
Outward Bound wilderness adventure

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,129
for a whole month to make him
more decisive and confident.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,690
He sent
his own son, too,

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,650
and the counselor said
they both grew up, big time.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,285
How was my summer?
It was pretty mixed.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,443
I invented a new power drink
made out of beet runoff.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,289
Mmm. Mmm!

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,963
So that's really good.

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,883
But I got some
disappointing medical news.

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,167
Mr. Schrute, the results are in.
You're not the father.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,766
I told you. God.

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,810
On!

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,291
Oh, my God!

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,002
Oh! What a summer!
An emotional roller coaster.

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,801
I ran over a turtle in the parking lot.

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,650
But then I saved him by gluing
his shell back together.

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,722
But I'm not that good
at puzzles.

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,370
That piece
doesn't go there.

22
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,720
Shh.

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,491
So I patched him with stuff
from around the office,

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,129
but I couldn't get
the pieces to fit right.

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,562
Then one day, while I was
reaching for the glue,

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,728
I crushed his shell again.

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,249
But I rebuilt him
even better that time.

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,481
But it turned out
the turtle was already dead.

29
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,362
Probably when I ran over him
the first time.

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,845
For us? Um...

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,923
Nothing new, really.
The kids are great.

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,963
You are really good at modesty.
She's a genius.

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,281
She painted this incredible
mural in the kids' room.

34
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,890
There's a hippo leading a parade...
Okay.

35
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,041
...of 500 children
through the village.

36
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,531
Well, you had
that interesting thing.

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,285
Oh! Yeah.

38
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,647
Yes, Jim's friend is
starting a new company

39
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,171
based on this idea
that Jim had

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,691
when they were
back in college.

41
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,969
It's sports marketing, basically,
but the athletes are partners.

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,644
And he wanted Jim
to be a partner, too.

43
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,520
In Philly, so that doesn't
really work for the family.

44
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,369
But watch this guy make a
billion dollars off my idea.

45
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,522
He said if it takes off, he's
going to buy us a new car.

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,409
An Altima or better.

47
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,329
TOBY". Kelly Kapoor is gone.

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,324
Her fiancé, Ravi, was hired
as a pediatrics professor

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,050
at Miami University.

50
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,531
I don't need 'em
anymore.

51
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,206
I am going to Miami,
biyatches,

52
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,568
to hang with LeBron James
and Gloria Estefan!

53
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,731
Miami University,
in Ohio.

54
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,284
On her last day, Kelly was still
a little confused about it.

55
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,800
Enjoy the snow, losers!

56
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,564
I'm so happy
for you, Kelly.

57
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,686
Shortly after Kelly
left, Ryan quit

58
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,002
and also moved to Ohio,

59
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,129
for what he claimed
were unrelated reasons.

60
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,125
I've actually done a lot of
market research, and it turns out

61
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,044
that Southwestern Ohio is going
to be the next Silicon Valley.

62
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,168
They call it
the Silicon Prairie.

63
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,489
It's a big university
town and, uhH.

64
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,483
This is not garbage.
It's my clothes.

65
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,008
And that was our summer.

66
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,728
- We good?
- Yeah, thanks.

67
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,844
Don't you guys
have everything? I mean,

68
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,803
it's just a paper company-

69
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,928
Well, we're more following you
guys, to see how you turn out.

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,641
Oh! Yeah, I guess we were kind
of dramatic in the beginning.

71
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,210
Well.

72
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,806
I don't think anything's going
to change in our lives now.

73
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,291
With work and two kids,

74
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,968
I guess nothing interesting is going
to happen to us for along, long time.

75
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,522
Andy's coming back today.

76
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,251
Hey, does anybody know
where we throw these out?

77
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,524
Oh, my God.
It's called a garbage can.

78
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,601
Helpless.

79
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,441
There's two new guys
back there with me now.

80
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,569
They're in their 20s.
We really get along.

81
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,125
Looking good!

82
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,086
We're just three single guys,
getting into trouble.

83
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,524
They're like the new
Jim and Dwight.

84
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,290
Oh. Yes.
Yes, I see that. Perfect.

85
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,527
Hey, New Jim.
Come sit on my face.

86
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,805
No, thank you.
My name's Pete.

87
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,362
No, Pete is not
the new Jim.

88
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,001
The only thing
we have in common

89
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,082
is that neither of us wants
to sit on Meredith's face.

90
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,491
And if that makes him
the new Jim,

91
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,524
then every human being
in the world is the new Jim.

92
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,570
Andy's here! Old Dwight!
New Dwight!

93
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,290
Andy's here! New Jim!
Tuna! Andy's here!

94
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,401
Pam. He's here.

95
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,001
Hey!

96
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,565
Ah!

97
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,441
Wow! I thought about this place
a lot when I was on solo.

98
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,163
Three days on a mountain.
It'll change you.

99
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,685
The things
we think we need.

100
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,410
Clocks! Yeah, right.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,287
It sounds amazing.
Tell us all about it.

102
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,606
What are you
still doing here?

103
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,364
Wonderful, thanks.

104
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,726
You know, I had this really funny
dream during Outward Bound

105
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,046
that you died.

106
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,246
Brilliant!

107
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,689
See me
in my office later.

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,971
The new guys! All right.
It's Clark and, uh...

109
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,963
Pete.

110
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,970
In Outward Bound, it was
all about nicknames.

111
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,690
They called me "iceman."

112
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,524
You will be called Plop.

113
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,647
What? Why?

114
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,721
'Cause you're
always taking dumps.

115
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,801
No, I'm not.

116
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,087
Come on, everybody defecates.
Relax, Plop.

117
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,682
You will be called Fart.
Because you fart all the time.

118
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,761
I love it!

119
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,851
Actually, Andy, we call
this one Dwight Jr.

120
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,046
You know,
I prefer Fart.

121
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,964
No! Dwight Jr.,
infinitely better.

122
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,691
You guys look exactly alike.
Dwight, go stand next to him.

123
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,569
This is insane.
No, we...

124
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,211
I don't see it. I don't either.
I don't either.

125
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,887
Whoa! Mind blown!

126
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,041
It's like
father and son.

127
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,562
That's...

128
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,211
Dwight, you cool
if we call him Dwight Jr.?

129
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,081
Yes.

130
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,801
Yes, lam.

131
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,921
That's okay.

132
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,810
Dwight Jr.

133
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,603
In a way, it's like
I have a son.

134
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,967
And who knows? Maybe someday
they'll hire someone

135
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,003
who looks like
a younger version of him.

136
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,204
And then
I'll have a grandson.

137
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,681
VVeH, I need to give my
cat up for adoption.

138
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,801
Mmm.

139
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,371
The one who uses
the doorbell,

140
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,044
or the one with
the Mexican hat,

141
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,929
or the one with
the rain galoshes,

142
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,849
or the one that you
let go around naked?

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,525
Angela's cats are cute.

144
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,484
So cute that you
just want to eat them.

145
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,328
But you can't eat cats.

146
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,727
You can't eat cats, Kevin.

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,686
No, the one with the long hair
and the denim pants. Comstock.

148
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,807
Oh!

149
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,611
Okay, look. He's such
a special kitty.

150
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,603
I just want to
find him a good home.

151
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,364
He loves those pants.

152
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,371
I'll take him.

153
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,250
Please.
After the turtle?

154
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,369
I am enormously proud
of what I did for that turtle!

155
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,280
Oscar? Oscar,
will you take him?

156
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,600
No, I'm a dog person.

157
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,441
If you pray enough, you can change
yourself into a cat person.

158
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,484
Those guys always
turn back, Angela.

159
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,523
David, Outward Bound was incredible!
I was the best at slacklining.

160
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,601
I ate a worm.

161
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,721
I'm glad to hear it.

162
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,848
You sound really
confident and decisive.

163
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,724
Hey, you wanted to see me?

164
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,847
Yeah. Got to go, David.

165
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,526
Why is Nellie still here?

166
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,971
You can only fire
Nellie for cause.

167
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,726
Mmm. Then I will
make up a cause.

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,082
Except you just told me
you were going to make it up.

169
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,401
Now if she sues, lWlhaveto
testify against you.

170
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,723
Then forget I just told you that.
Can't.

171
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,681
I took a course at the
Weintraub Memory Academy.

172
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,161
I sat next to this woman
named Beverly Brooke,

173
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,163
she had a Greek
salad for lunch.

174
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,321
See what I mean?

175
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,410
Now I know why Michael
hated you so much.

176
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,571
Good boy.
Getting big and strong.

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,286
Snack foods!

178
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,365
Yep.

179
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,206
Body by Cheez-it.

180
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,001
Ah! Humor.
I have it, too.

181
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,651
Oh, boy, I got a
couple of tickets

182
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,961
to the Slayer concert
10 months from now.

183
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,764
You interested?

184
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,128
I think I'm busy
that night, or I would.

185
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,128
Mmm. Okay, well, we're both just kind
of learning as we go, aren't we?

186
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,929
Learning what?
Just

187
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,761
how this is going to be,
you know?

188
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,449
You have
a beautiful round head.

189
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,964
Okay. So what kind of
farming are you into, huh?

190
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,281
More of a fruit man
or a root man?

191
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,963
Hey, is this code
for, like, gay stuff?

192
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,722
'Cause, if so, that's totally fine.
Like, I'm fine with it,

193
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,531
but, you know, you should know
that I'm into the ladies.

194
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,441
Spoken like
a true root man.

195
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,724
Hey, you know?
If you're ever swamped,

196
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,649
I can make some
sales calls for you.

197
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,607
My calls?

198
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,047
So could you give me
a list of all your clients,

199
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,003
or just the leads that you
haven't had time to pursue yet?

200
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,447
You want a list of my clients?
You want my leads?

201
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,085
Yeah, I'll just give it a glance.
Okay.

202
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,321
I'll give it a read.

203
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,680
You know, with my leads
and stuff like that.

204
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,409
Because you're interested
in going into sales.

205
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,608
I am. Yeah.
Wow, that's great.

206
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,251
That's great. Okay, good.
Let's talk about that.

207
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,401
Okay_
Okay?

208
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,204
You're not
getting my clients!

209
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,566
Nice try.

210
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,646
Paranoid? I'm not
familiar with the word.

211
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,041
And I really don't have time to
learn new words right now, okay?

212
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,646
A pudgy 22-year-old
is trying to take my job.

213
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,920
Jim, get ready for the
battle of your life.

214
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,525
Done. Explain.

215
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,610
The new guys. Dwight Jr.
is after my job.

216
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,241
Yeah. There is a shark hiding
inside that adorable little cherub.

217
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,606
Oh! Now I get what
Pete was talking about

218
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,085
at the sales
meeting yesterday.

219
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,201
Wait, sales?
What sales meeting?

220
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,527
The new guys called one.

221
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,801
The new guys
called a sales meeting?

222
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,406
Clark ended the whole thing
with a karate demonstration.

223
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,050
Did you know there was
a belt above black?

224
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,091
There is no belt
above black.

225
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,729
Is there a belt above black?
You should ask him.

226
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,165
It's a color you
would never expect.

227
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,128
Too easy.

228
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,449
Attention, everyone!
Comstock is still available.

229
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,047
Oscar has been flirting
with adopting him,

230
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,521
but still hasn't given me
a definite yes or no.

231
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,443
Definitely no.
Fine.

232
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,566
For any interested candidates, I will
be conducting 20-minute interviews.

233
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,286
My ideal situation would be an
independently wealthy cute couple

234
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,930
with a strong
commitment to education.

235
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,925
Black or white, I'm fine
with either, but not both.

236
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,329
Listen, you're in this, but
you need to wow me, okay?

237
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,848
I wanted to talk to you about our
working relationship this year.

238
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,524
It's going to be terrible.

239
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,924
Not necessarily.

240
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,004
No, I'm going to
make sure that it is,

241
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,607
and if it isn't, I will take
immediate action to rectify that.

242
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,440
Now, I don't like to throw
around the "B" word.

243
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,760
But I'm going to be
a huge bitch to you.

244
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,043
Now this is called
slacklining.

245
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,088
I set up the old
slackline to teach the office

246
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,367
the skills of
focus and discipline,

247
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,563
or in the case of
certain individuals,

248
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,962
the skills of humiliation
and looking really dumb.

249
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,881
If you make it all the way across,
your confidence will soar.

250
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,726
But if you Toby out,

251
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,280
then you'll feel
like a real Nellie.

252
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,404
How about a hand,
screw those guys.

253
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,921
Now, these are my actual Outward
Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather.

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,843
Iceman.
That's me.

255
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,408
The powder is
for your protection.

256
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,209
Feather has permanent
athlete's foot.

257
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,602
Feather, show them how you
dance upon the line of slack.

258
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,970
You, uh,
you a sports guy?

259
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,086
Sure. Boxing, tennis.

260
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,083
Oh! Any team sports?

261
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,002
NASCAR,
The Amazing Race.

262
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,404
Phillies fan though, right?

263
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,686
You mean horses?

264
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,811
No. Like baseball,
the baseball team.

265
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,611
I like the Red Sox.
I'm from Vermont, so...

266
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,648
Okay. Good talk.

267
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,367
I have nothing in
common with Plop.

268
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,444
All right, who's next?
Nellie!

269
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,250
Oh, I would rather watch you
and your talented friends.

270
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,125
Nonsense, get up here.

271
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,730
Go ahead.

272
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,006
Come on.

273
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,088
Uh, you going
to wear your heels?

274
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,528
I'm very self-conscious
about my feet.

275
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,964
Okay. There you go!
Attagirl.

276
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,726
Hey, all right. Whoa, you suck.

277
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,169
All right, who's next?
Darryl?

278
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,487
This seems like
the kind of thing

279
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,681
white people
with dreadlocks do.

280
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,883
Dwight Jr.?
This looks like your speed.

281
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,123
Uh, I guess I could
give it a shot.

282
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,611
Yeah, come on.
Get up here.

283
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,482
Just hop on up.
Okay.

284
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,689
Focus on the horizon.

285
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,241
Whoa! Look at this guy!

286
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,447
I've always been good at
anything that required balance.

287
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,568
My doctor says I have
gigantic inner ears.

288
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,969
- Go, Dwight Jr.!
- That was insane!

289
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,481
Yes!

290
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,681
Boo! Unimpressed!

291
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,127
It's a tightrope
for babies! Boo!

292
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,089
All right, let's see you do it.
All right. Let me show you

293
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,401
how a real man walks
across a flaccid cord.

294
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,966
Oh!

295
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,604
Who ordered
the hot apple fail?

296
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,921
Okay. lam just
getting started, okay?

297
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,648
You got this.
This is all you.

298
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,765
Oh!

299
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,441
Oh!
Oh!

300
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,611
Got ourselves
a yard sale!

301
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,525
Ah!

302
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,451
Oh! Oh!

303
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,281
Balls and face!
It's not a race, Dwight.

304
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,083
Well, it's official. Old Dwight
is lame and New Dwight is cool.

305
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,366
That's not true.

306
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,923
- Just give me another chance.
- But your mouth is...

307
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,526
This is a bloodbath. All
right, I'm calling this.

308
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,883
What? It's enough of this.
Everyone, let's go back to work.

309
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,530
This is a stupid activity.
This is not okay.

310
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,648
I would be embarrassed
to be good at it.

311
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,646
Idiots!

312
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,086
Slacklining.
Big deal.

313
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,403
Untie that rope, give it to a
couple of pigtailed schoolgirls,

314
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,882
let them start jumping with it while
chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys.

315
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,682
Doesn't seem so macho now, does it?
It's a jump rope!

316
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,691
Dwight?

317
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,244
Pam? Hey, I'm up here.
Up the ladder, come on.

318
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,881
What are you doing?

319
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,042
Come here, I'll show you.

320
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,088
Why do you want
this cat?

321
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,766
Um, I don't
want it, really.

322
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,086
How would you
support the cat?

323
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,889
What are your
ambitions?

324
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,684
I want to start
my own business.

325
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,569
I want to be a millionaire,
lots of things.

326
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,563
Travel. Make the world
a better place.

327
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,889
Earn an MBA at night.

328
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,442
Have you taken
any concrete steps?

329
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,611
Well, I'm still
just fitting in here,

330
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,882
you know, getting used to the new job.
Mmm-hmm.

331
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,048
But definitely
on the agenda.

332
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,324
But that is a good idea, Angela.
I should make a list.

333
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,403
Oh, come on, Pete!

334
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,570
That's just sad.

335
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,248
If he doesn't watch himself, he's going
to be here for years doing nothing.

336
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,327
Wow, maybe Pete
is the new Jim.

337
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,168
Do you see how the trapeze
completely surrounds the wire?

338
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,802
That means it is literally
impossible for anyone to fall off.

339
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,690
So you will merely sit below
and be my counterweight

340
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,843
as I pedal across the parking
lot to that telephone pole.

341
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,206
I will?
You Will.

342
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,850
Yeah, we weigh about the
same, wouldn't you say?

343
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,601
Sure, if you
weigh 105 pounds.

344
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,490
So you'll do it?
No.

345
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,007
Come on, this will be the only
thrill of your boring life.

346
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,041
Dwight, you may find this hard to
believe, but I love my boring life.

347
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,531
Come on!
Exactly the way it is.

348
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,687
No, Pam.
Yes!

349
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,201
And there's nothing you can
say that would get me to run

350
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,009
the slightest risk
of losing it.

351
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,127
Please? Please, Pam?

352
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,687
Find someone else. I
don't know, ask Phyllis.

353
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,610
I can't use Phyllis.
Are you kidding me?

354
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,729
The moment she steps off this
bar, I'll be launched into space.

355
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,689
God! You're so insensitive.

356
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,128
Why are you getting rid of it?
Allergies.

357
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,802
Your husband?
No, the baby.

358
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,644
Please, it's my
husband's favorite cat.

359
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,286
He's broken up
about it.

360
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,125
It's the only time I've seen him
cry, other than our wedding night.

361
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,527
You know what?
I will take Comstock.

362
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,921
Really? Oh, Oscar,
thank you.

363
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,444
I'll come by after work
and pick him up.

364
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,328
Yay! Oh! Poor Robert.
He won't get to say goodbye.

365
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,084
He has this
business dinner tonight.

366
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,166
(Test la vie.

367
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,570
Please don't
teach the cat French.

368
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,762
Yeah, good news. Tonight, when
you come over for dinner,

369
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,207
you can play with
your old buddy, Comstock.

370
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,765
You ready?

371
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,881
Yeah.

372
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,641
You know what?
I'll meet you down there.

373
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,960
I just got to make
a quick call.

374
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,525
Okay-

375
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,846
Okay-

376
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,331
All right.

377
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,120
Oh, God.

378
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,883
Attention, employees
of Dunder Mifflin!

379
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,211
Everyone thinks the new guys are so
cool, 'cause they can slackline.

380
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,971
Ooh!

381
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,845
Hey, Clark! This is what
a real salesman looks like!

382
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,407
They say that you only live once,
and I'm about to prove it!

383
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,811
Dwight Schrute!

384
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,927
Dwight!

385
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,201
Hey, man, it's Halpert. Did
you go to the other guy yet?

386
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,328
Great. Don't. I'm in.

387
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,408
Yeah. Yep, I'm all in.

388
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,284
Okay, talk to you soon. Bye.

389
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,520
Yeah!

390
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,369
- Call someone?
- Call somebody!

391
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,641
Hold on, Dwight!

392
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,565
In the parking lot
today, there was a circus.

393
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,688
A copier did tricks
on the high wire.

394
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,849
A lady tried to give away a
baby that looked like a cat.

395
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,447
There was a Dwight impersonator
and a Jim impersonator.

396
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,329
A strongman crushed a turtle.

397
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,842
I laughed and I cried.

398
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,168
Not bad for a day "m the
“fie of a dog food company.

399
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,408
Crap. Sorry, Nellie!

400
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,768
Once again, I understand
that old habits die hard,

401
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,528
but if everyone would kindly walk
their refuse to the trash bins

402
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,921
instead of tossing them,
then we wouldn't...

403
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,521
Oh!

404
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,601
Swish.

405
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,171
It was nothing to do
with me.

406
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,686
I just happen to be sitting
near to where the bins are.

407
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,725
There are two things
that I am passionate about,

408
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,040
recycling

409
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,844
and revenge.

410
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,884
Fluke.
