1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,927
Stone & Son Suit Warehouse recently
lost their paper provider.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,651
They're a family-owned business.

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,085
Jim and I used to
clean up with those.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,970
We'd go in pretending
to be family, brothers.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,771
We did it at
a family-owned law firm,

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,322
at a family-owned
construction company,

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,647
and a family-owned
motorcycle store.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,722
Jim and Dwight Schrupert.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,804
I was the dynamic, likeable winner
that was doted upon by Mom.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,484
Whoo-hoo!

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,286
Yeah!

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,811
And Jim was the closeted foot
fetishist pretending to belong.

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,128
The client never knew
any of that, but I knew.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,924
I hope you've been paying
your wig storage bills, Jimbo,

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,161
'cause it's time
for another episode

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,487
of Handsome and Stinky,
Paper Brothers for Hire.

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,724
Sorry, Stinky,
can't do it. Too busy.

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,882
Oh, God, this again?
You're Stinky!

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,645
Okay, there's no possible way I can
get there, so just ask Phyllis.

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,960
She can be your older
sister or something.

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,201
Phyllis, my sister?

22
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,363
More like my dead great-great-grandmother
who died of stupidity.

23
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,363
I have ears, Dwight.

24
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,685
Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis?
Like all human beings?

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,649
We all have ears.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,809
You see what you
leave me with here, Jim?

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,689
Hey, I'm in
Philadelphia right now.

28
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,366
How is that my problem? Get in
your car and drive down here.

29
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,006
You can make it in 30 minutes if
you drive 240 miles per hour.

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,481
Huh!

31
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,483
How long would it take me
if I drove 300 miles an hour?

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,561
Hmm.

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,129
That's a good question. 300 times...

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,206
A hundred and eighty. Um, that
comes to 25 minutes.

35
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,410
Yes. Oh, well, thank you, Jim.
Yes, lam better than you.

36
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,121
Thanks for acknowledging that.
Okay, bye bye. Love you.

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,690
Darryl!
L°°km9900d!

38
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,922
I'm heading to Philly,
interview with Jim's company.

39
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,529
Hey, good luck. When you get to
Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?

40
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,090
Why don't you come along
and tell him yourself?

41
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,811
That'd be great.
Kind of like ditching school,

42
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,089
except instead of getting
suspended, you get...

43
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,366
What do you get?

44
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,641
Oh, my God! Why didn't I think of this?
Andy's not here.

45
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,566
Oh, hey, Erin, Urn, I'm
expecting a shipment of pens.

46
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,687
Can you cover that?

47
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,808
Mmm, cover that.
What does that mean exactly?

48
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,928
What are we talking here?
Details.

49
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,806
A delivery guy will
deliver a box of pens,

50
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,530
and you just make sure
everything's in order.

51
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,161
What? Everything? How do I
make sure it's in order?

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,844
I haven't
been trained for this.

53
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,922
Okay, see you later.

54
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,850
Hey, guys.

55
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,200
Clark! Hey.

56
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,123
Hey, look who's back!
Dwight Jr.

57
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,206
Hey, so how was it?
I mean the sex with Jan.

58
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,203
A gentleman doesn't
discuss such matters,

59
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,567
especially when the feelings
of a lady are involved.

60
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,407
Women reach their sexual peak at
whatever age Jan was last week.

61
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,802
I mean, it was like making
love with a wild animal.

62
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,047
But not like a cougar, like you might
think. It was like a swarm of bees.

63
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,250
Bees that just find something
wrong with every hotel room.

64
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,049
Nothing wrong with
being a gentleman.

65
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,289
Like my mom used to say,
"Talk classy. Act nasty."

66
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,881
What's with the wig,
Meredith?

67
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,486
What?
Is it on backwards?

68
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,769
No. You got it. You fixed it.
Uh, I have a gift from Jan.

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,923
Ooh!
It's an espresso maker.

70
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,408
We came to be
quite fond of espresso

71
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,847
on the Amalfi Coast,
so bon appétit!

72
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,887
Ooh!

73
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,770
Sixteen types of espresso!
Now that's Italian.

74
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,083
My friend has one of these.
Fool-proof espresso, every time.

75
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,049
Always with the friends,
Oscar.

76
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,009
Can't we just enjoy
the new espresso machine?

77
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,203
Actually, it's
pronounced espresso.

78
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,448
Wait, that's
what you said.

79
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,320
I apologize. I just assumed you
would mispronounce it, so...

80
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,203
There he is!

81
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,768
We are all so proud of
you for the small part

82
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,968
that you played in
landing the White Pages.

83
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,520
Prouder of me, but...

84
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,965
If you really want
to show appreciation,

85
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,405
just give me
half the commission.

86
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,521
Gosh, you know, I wish
I could, but, uh, no.

87
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,801
Hey, listen, remember how everyone
used to call you Dwight Jr.,

88
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,961
and how much
you loved that?

89
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,690
I loved it.

90
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,800
How would you like to pretend to
be my son in order to land a sale?

91
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,008
If it will lead to me
being a salesman,

92
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,730
I'll pretend
to be your friend.

93
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,722
Then it looks like
we have a deal, Son.

94
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,167
Hi, guys.

95
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,004
Hey, look who it is.

96
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,005
Oh, sorry, super busy.
Pens coming in later.

97
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,321
Just grabbing a java before all
hell breaks loose.

98
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,285
- Try this one.
- Thank you.

99
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,249
I don't really have time
to think about Pete right now.

100
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,483
I just have a lot going on with
this whole shipment of pens.

101
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,211
And I have a lot of people trusting
me, and I would feel super-guilty

102
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,409
if I broke anyone's
trust about the pens.

103
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,725
You ready
for your interview?

104
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,529
I was born ready!

105
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,523
No. I suck at interviews.

106
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,807
I had Andy's job in the
bag until my interview.

107
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,450
Well, you shouldn't
be nervous about this.

108
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,003
This is a tiny start-up with a bunch
of guys just as dorky as Jim.

109
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,963
Yeah, I guess.

110
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,527
Really! You can't be scared
of a room full of Jims.

111
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,568
I love the guy, but he's
basically Gumby with hair.

112
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,082
It's kind of funny,
father-and-son sales team

113
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,242
meeting with a
father-and-son suit store.

114
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,649
You know? You're right. We hadn't
even thought of that, had we, boy?

115
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,722
No, we sure hadn't, Pop!

116
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,885
Oh, you're a hunter, I see.

117
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,443
Spend your early mornings out in the
blinds like Clarky and me, huh?

118
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,409
He calls me Clarky
'cause he's my dad.

119
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,766
Guilty.

120
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,569
You don't meet many
hunters these days.

121
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,881
My dad is
the best hunter there is.

122
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,043
I mean, he's like a
serial killer of animals.

123
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,801
One time, he snuck up
behind a sleeping deer

124
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,724
and just sawed its head
right off. It was sick.

125
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,484
It was his birthday. Just turned three.
So... Ah.

126
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,327
You guys, I kind of think I want
to try them all. Is that crazy?

127
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,164
Yeah. Look,
without a taste test,

128
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,846
how are we supposed to know which
flavors we like to reorder?

129
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,968
Taste test?
I'm in.

130
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,565
YOLO!

131
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,921
What?
Oh.

132
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,123
It's a thing.
It means you only live once.

133
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,771
Yeah, we're aware
of what it means, Oscar.

134
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,127
You just do not
look cool saying it.

135
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,931
Well... All right,
everybody, who's in?

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,001
Yep-

137
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,444
Angela? Don't make
us come over there.

138
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,045
No, I don't. No.

139
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,202
All right,
let's go.

140
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,760
Can't I just agree without
putting my hand in?

141
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,410
No way.
Absolutely not!

142
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,970
Oh, fine.

143
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,322
Okay, guys,
we all drink them all.

144
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,482
We all drink them all!

145
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,284
Yes.
Yes!

146
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,690
Hey, where's my ring?

147
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,364
I'm sure it'll turn up.

148
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,762
Yes, ma'am, you want
to go east on Franklin,

149
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,444
take that all
the way to Commonwealth.

150
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,285
You'll see us on the right side.
You can't miss us.

151
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,966
Yes, and I want to reach
every demographic possible.

152
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,530
No, I hear what you're
saying, and we will.

153
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,887
The thing is, we've got to lock
down this key demographic first.

154
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,725
The rest will come, I promise. Just
give me a couple of weeks, all right?

155
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,881
We're talking weeks here,
not months, right?

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,161
Weeks, always weeks.

157
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,810
Man, the last time
I talked months

158
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,649
was, like,
a million weeks ago.

159
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,484
All right. Good.

160
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,721
Thanks, Dennis.
Appreciate it.

161
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,370
Hey! How are you?
Good.

162
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,249
What are you doing here? I
just wanted to see you.

163
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,810
That's so great.
Damn.

164
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,168
Jim, you've got a real Facebook
energy going on here, man.

165
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,605
You Zuckerberg'ed
this place out.

166
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,887
It's pretty great, right?
I mean, we're coming along.

167
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,442
Hey, Wade! We've got to just
push up Dennis' timeline.

168
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,329
Okay.
Actually, you know what?

169
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,528
Give me one second, okay?
Make yourselves at home.

170
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,000
But I think that all of your
concerns will be answered

171
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,526
when you see the brochure that
Clark's getting out of my car.

172
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,523
He's a good boy.
Does whatever I say.

173
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,726
Yeah.

174
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,761
I can't relate to that.
My son hates my guts.

175
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,885
Oh, really?

176
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,088
I bring him into the
business, and he resents me.

177
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,003
How do you like that?

178
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,607
Well, things between me
and Clark are good, not great.

179
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,089
In fact, I will say that
they're not even good, really.

180
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,731
They're bad.
Like you and your son.

181
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,010
Here you go, P0P!

182
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,890
I know it was just a couple of
minutes, but God, I missed you!

183
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,281
What took you so long?
Were you loitering

184
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,971
out there like a hooligan,
smoking a doobie?

185
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,169
I sure was, just like he taught me.
Looking cool.

186
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,368
You're being disrespectful.

187
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,800
And I love you
for saying that.

188
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,811
We don't get along.

189
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,366
I just burned him,

190
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,445
because the truth
is our relationship is...

191
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,841
Terrible!
Terrible.

192
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,845
Yes, genius.
Stupid, stupid genius.

193
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,165
Wow, this place is so great.
I had no idea!

194
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,924
On the phone, you made
it sound kind of dinky.

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,968
Well, I mean, I don't
even have a paycheck yet.

196
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,805
It is a start-up, so these
things go down all the time.

197
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,807
If this company is going down,
I want to go down on it.

198
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,450
With it,
I want to go down with it.

199
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,801
Are you cool
to just hang out?

200
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,245
- Sure. No problem.
- Yeah?

201
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,527
You ready? Let's do it. Yeah.

202
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,123
The pen delivery
went amazing.

203
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,202
And now I've got all these pens
just waiting to be unpacked,

204
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,884
but Pam did not tell
me to unpack the pens.

205
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,961
And I'm not one
of those people

206
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,247
who's just like, "Sure, I'll accept
the pens when they come in,"

207
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,049
and then as soon as your back's
turned, I unpack the pens,

208
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,964
and get all this credit
as some great pen un-packer!

209
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,611
On the other hand,
they are just sitting here.

210
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,326
Pam didn't tell me
not to unpack them.

211
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,528
I don't want to be a busybody, but
I don't want to be a lazybones.

212
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,967
Busybody, lazybones,
busybody, lazybones. Ah!

213
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,241
My brain is
ping-ponging around

214
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,890
in my head right now.
lfsinsane!

215
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,564
I'm sorry. What was your question again?
Oh, yeah.

216
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,769
No, I've never had an espresso before.
They're good, though.

217
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,445
Ah-bam!

218
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,401
My favorite is
Viennese Amaretto,

219
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,924
and the worst flavor I have
tried so far is Alpine Select.

220
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,206
Yes!

221
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,129
One! Two! Three! Kevin! Kevin!
Kevin! Stop it!

222
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,163
That's enough, Kevin. That's enough!
Cut it, Kevin! Kevin!

223
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,685
So, for your menswear
catalog,

224
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,081
I think we can offer you some
very competitive pricing.

225
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,207
I heard that before.

226
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,770
Well, I understand...
I'll bet you have.

227
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,684
He knows nothing about what
people have heard before, my son.

228
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,240
Here we go again, another
lecture from the old man.

229
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,049
Listen to him!
He created you.

230
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,566
Maybe if you listened a
little bit, you'd improve.

231
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,768
No wonder
women despise you.

232
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,211
Women don't despise me.

233
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,250
Oh, his last girlfriend was a transvestite.
I knew it right away.

234
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,402
Adam's apple like
the prow of a ship.

235
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,165
Thumbs like
a lowland gorilla.

236
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,527
But this one couldn't see it
or didn't want to see it.

237
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,530
All right, that's enough, 'cause I
could say some things about him, too.

238
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,086
Yeah? Like what? Like the
time that you got drunk

239
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,642
and killed those kids
on their way to prom.

240
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,802
Thatneverhappened.
He's always been a liar.

241
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,927
Ever since he
was a little kid,

242
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,641
and he got caught saving "treats"
from the kitty litter box.

243
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,721
Really shameful.

244
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,406
So we can offer you matte or
glossy printing in a variety...

245
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,403
Glistening brown
morsels tumbling

246
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,970
from every pouch
in his trousers.

247
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,765
There's obviously a volume discount.
lfyou“.

248
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,002
Following the cat
around on his knees

249
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,242
with his hands
cupped beneath its tail,

250
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,085
going, "Please, kitty,
may I have some more?"

251
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,810
You can't make this stuff up.

252
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,249
No, I think someone could make it
up, someone with very few friends.

253
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,924
Hey, fellas,
sorry to keep you waiting.

254
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,082
There he is. My son.

255
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,323
He's got cat turd
collector written all over him.

256
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,571
Did you say
"cat turd collector"?

257
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,007
So, definitely looking to
expand our market, but for now,

258
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,525
we're just
concentrating on athletes

259
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,090
that are popular
here in the Northeast.

260
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,730
Of course,
that's not a mandate.

261
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,323
Mandate. Always think
of two men on a date.

262
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,601
I have gay friends.
One gay friend. Oscar.

263
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,761
Mmm-hmm.

264
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,286
All right, so what makes you
think you'd be a good fit here?

265
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,840
Okay. Um...

266
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,690
All right.

267
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,730
Obviously,
y'all are really busy,

268
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,041
and I don't want to
waste your time anymore.

269
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,043
I'm sorry. I just...

270
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,081
Obviously, I'm not
qualified to be here, man.

271
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,607
I'm a warehouse manager,
you know?

272
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,971
Darryl, I was
a newspaper editor.

273
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,088
Science teacher,
volleyball coach.

274
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,402
I work at Home
Shopping Network.

275
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,803
I'm a lawyer. I'm the only one
here who can honestly help.

276
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,490
And as you know,
I was a paper salesman.

277
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,484
Hey, I find it helps if you
just picture everybody naked.

278
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,491
Cool. Hey, thanks.

279
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,968
So, how about
we start over?

280
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,850
Darryl, do you have any
thoughts on the company?

281
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,766
Yes. Yes, as a matter of fact,
I wrote some down.

282
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,964
There you go.

283
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,045
Wow, this guy came prepared.
That impresses me.

284
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,004
Ah, so, this is what 2:00 p.m.
looks like around here.

285
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,571
LusuaHytake
a siesta about now.

286
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,442
Stocking pens, huh? You're like
the new office administrator.

287
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,163
No, I just took over the pen
shipment because Pam had to leave.

288
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,084
When I say it out loud, I know that sounds
insane, but it's the truth, I swear.

289
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,245
Pam! Pam! Look out! Erin's
gunning for your job!

290
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,810
No, I'm not.

291
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,042
It's not like that at all!
Forget it.

292
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,724
Pam, look out!
I'm so sorry.

293
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,681
Pens, you did not buy into this. lam sorry.
What a day you've had.

294
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,810
By the way, Jim talks
about you all the time.

295
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,130
That's sweet that
he talks about me.

296
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,283
It's too bad he still has to work
part-time in Scranton, though.

297
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,089
Well, that's funny,
'cause I think of him

298
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,003
as working
part-time in Philadelphia.

299
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,650
We can't wait
until you move here.

300
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,009
I'm sorry. You guys are
here to sell us paper?

301
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,048
Do you mind?
The men are talking.

302
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,963
Sons used to
idolize their fathers.

303
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,042
Us old-timers need
to stick together,

304
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,283
and how better than
by signing a contract?

305
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,206
Pdloveto. But Sam Jr. here,
he runs the business now.

306
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,608
Kind of pushed me out,
truth be told.

307
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,842
I'm just here
for human contact.

308
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,285
Okay, Pop.

309
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,488
Wait, so you're the boss?

310
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,202
That's right.

311
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,930
Hi, I'm Clark.
Hey.

312
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,849
Let's talk.
Okay.

313
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,124
So if you look at
our catalog here...

314
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,446
Well, thanks for
coming down, Darryl.

315
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,681
It was nice
meeting you, Darryl.

316
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,966
I think you'd
fit in great here.

317
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,004
Yeah, yeah, me too.

318
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,845
I think it would be like...
You know what?

319
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,282
I think it'd be like a Kevin
Durant jump shot, perfecto.

320
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,526
Oh, my God.

321
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,281
They're the ones who put a fish
tank next to a basketball hoop.

322
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,044
It's like, if I put
a glass of milk on the edge

323
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,849
of a table,
and Cece knocks it over,

324
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,007
I don't blame Cece.

325
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,401
So, I'm like a three-year-old
girl in this scenario?

326
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,802
Say they don't hire you. It's not
like you're out on the street.

327
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,201
You have a great job
with people who love you.

328
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,081
And I'd only get to see
Jada on the weekends.

329
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,245
You know, I'm not so sure I'd
like living in Philadelphia.

330
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,926
Right? Thank you!
It's just Philly.

331
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,571
Everyone's acting like it's New
York, or Paris, or London.

332
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,802
Who needs it?
Not us.

333
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,286
Okay, so the consensus
was that that was unique.

334
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,730
They're going to make
you pay for the fish,

335
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,644
and they wanted to
know when you can start.

336
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,441
What?

337
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,928
How about yesterday?

338
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,649
Congratulations.
Oh, thank you!

339
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,529
I guess you've got to
move to Philly after all.

340
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,365
Yes! I love Philly! 215 or die!

341
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,521
Come on, man!

342
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,649
No, I'm not upset.
I'm really excited for Darryl.

343
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,487
Maybe I'm a little disappointed
that we'll be losing him.

344
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,969
It feels really hot in here.
Is it hot in here?

345
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,326
It feels really,
really hot in here.

346
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,450
Ifsinsane! They need to turn the
AC on year-round. January too!

347
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,249
I don't get the point
of this stupid window!

348
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,404
I mean, look,
you and I both know

349
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,847
that in paper or fashion,
styles change.

350
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,087
Check out my dad's suit. You
are looking at pure acrylic.

351
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,889
That's why his face
always breaks out.

352
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,721
Does that suit come
with a fire extinguisher?

353
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,365
You know what, Dad? Maybe
you should buy me a suit.

354
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,406
Hmm. I mean, I'm going
to need one, right,

355
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,766
if I'm ever going
to get a "real" job

356
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,844
and move my lazy ass
out of your "GD" house?

357
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,046
He's got you there.

358
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,047
That's Italian silk.
Very comfortable,

359
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,606
very tasteful,
although expensive.

360
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,251
Yeah, you don't want Italian.
You'll look like a mafia don.

361
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,561
Next thing you know, you'll be
doing life at Riker's Island.

362
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,926
Uh, that's better
than looking like

363
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,729
the undertaker
from Boring Island.

364
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,521
That place doesn't exist.
It's not a documented island.

365
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,204
Cartograph much?

366
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,524
How do I look?

367
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,966
Actually, you look great.
They steered you right.

368
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,726
I guess it does make sense buying
from a father-son team.

369
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,361
You know what?
I'll take one, too.

370
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,969
Everyone, now that we
have all this energy,

371
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,089
why don't we move the copier into the
annex like we've always wanted to?

372
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,565
Whoo!

373
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,721
Frickin' A!
Huh?

374
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,848
So long, noise!

375
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,524
One, two, three!

376
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,647
Oh!

377
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,370
And we have
torn up the carpet.

378
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,044
Oh, we are going to be
in so much trouble!

379
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,321
Wait!

380
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,362
It's beautiful!
Hardwood!

381
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,526
I always knew
it was down here.

382
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,126
I just never dreamed
that I would actually see it.

383
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,964
Tear up the carpet!

384
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,083
Killed their fish, and they still hired me!
That's how you do that, baby!

385
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,129
It's all good. I'm ready.
Y'all ready for this?

386
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,005
♪ Everybody dance now a'

387
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,161
Yeah!

388
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,247
Kevin, move!

389
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,005
I can't pull up the rug if you're
standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.

390
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,761
Well, I can't stand here if you
pull the carpet out from under me.

391
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,050
Oh, my head is killing me. Does
anyone have a baby aspirin?

392
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,531
Oh, enough with the
whining, akeadyl

393
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,045
Why don't you just
have some more coffee?

394
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,885
It's all gone! I didn't get
a chance to try them all,

395
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,884
because Creed poured my
Bogota Sunrise in the plant.

396
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,007
I saw the leaves twitch.

397
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,161
Shut up!

398
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,321
You shut up!

399
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,050
Everybody
shut up and work!

400
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,406
We don't work for you!

401
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,561
Yeah!
Yeah!

402
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,290
Hey, it's 5:00.

403
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,041
Kevin, can you...

404
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,121
What is going on?

405
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,128
Yes! We did it!

406
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,929
Well, you opened the door.

407
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,004
And you closed it.
The boys are back in town!

408
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,930
High fives!

409
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,445
Hey, so, all that really
specific cat turd business,

410
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,602
that was about you, right?

411
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,763
You got me!
I used to collect them.

412
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,887
Why?

413
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,768
Each one is very different,
like a snowflake.

414
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,929
Hey, what happened here?

415
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,889
You left me in
charge of the pens, Pam.

416
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,123
That's what happened.
The pens happened!

417
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,204
Are the pens here?
