00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,368
What the hell?

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,249
No! This is not happening.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,522
Didn't you get the memo?
It's Stairmageddon.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,204
Come on, Stanley!

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,011
Dwight is having maintenance
done on the elevator today,

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,724
and he was really
on top of it.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,610
Weeks ago, he started the
Stairmageddon Awareness campaign.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,011
The idea was to get us prepared
both mentally and physically

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,926
for a day that hopefully comes
once in a hundred years.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,128
It's a mageddon!

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,927
Come on! Come on,
Stanley! Stay in it!

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,688
I put 17 damn years
into this company,

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,331
and now they're making me
climb Stair Mountain?

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,726
Come on!

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,203
Our office has an unusually large
number of unusually large people.

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,687
This is an abomination!

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,761
Come on,
you got this!

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,083
OSCAR". So when something as routine
as elevator maintenance happens,

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,403
and people are forced to
expend cardiovascular effort,

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,131
we have to compare
it to the end of time.

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,447
Red alert, red alert!

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,410
The reviews are in!
I repeat, the reviews are in!

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,323
What? I just got a
text from my brother.

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,370
ScrantonTimesTribune.com. There's
a review of the documentary.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,566
What does it say?

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,921
I don't know, Phyllis!

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,367
I just got the text and
started screaming red alert!

28
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,290
Well, the alert was already set
to red, because of Stairmageddon.

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,731
Do you think I should
set it to double red?

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,366
I think we should.

Mmm.

86
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,526
Did you know, that is the only
kind of counseling I've never had.

87
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,369
You know, Jim's kind
of nervous about it,

88
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,568
but I think it could really help.
Mmm.

89
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,723
If we're having issues, it can't
hurt to talk about them, right?

90
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,441
Hey, Toby. Um... I wanted
to ask you a question.

91
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,567
Oh, sure.

92
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,330
It's a little,
uh, personal.

93
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,004
Let's do it.
Let's get personal.

94
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,209
I wanted to talk to you
about your divorce. Whoa.

95
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,521
Sorry. I...
No, no, no. What I meant...

96
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,290
What I meant actually, was...
No. It's okay,

97
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,404
I can handle it.
Uh... So?

98
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,050
You guys obviously went
through some tough times

99
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,690
leading up to it.

100
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,761
Okay-

101
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,611
I was wondering if you ever
did any couples counseling?

102
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,887
Oh sure, lots of times, yeah.

103
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,489
Wait, you and Pam aren't in
couples counseling, are you?

104
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,561
Oh, God!

105
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,407
No, no. We're just starting
couples counseling.

106
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,681
Uh...

107
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,882
Which doesn't
sound any better.

108
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,324
Even you GUYS-

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,721
Kelly called it.

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,490
Hey! Hey, hey. No. No. Get out of here.
Clark, get out of here.

111
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,483
My mistake. TOBY: Yes,
it is your mistake.

112
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,643
He's lingering,
so annoying.

113
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,006
I'm going
to kill him.

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,731
How can I help? I'm here.
That's all right.

115
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,529
Hello,
William Morris Agency?

116
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,090
I need to speak
with your best agent

117
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,328
who represents
your biggest stars.

118
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,846
Yes, I'll hold.

119
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,890
I'm sorry, I misunderstood.
Goodbye.

120
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,922
Thank you, Stan.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,082
Oh, honey.

122
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,045
Look, I just want our life
to get back to normal.

123
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,764
Ribbon cuttings,
charity balls.

124
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,162
Don't worry. I've scheduled a
press conference for later today.

125
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,811
We just need to face
the cameras together,

126
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,690
a beloved public servant
and his devoted wife.

127
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,489
And move on.

128
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,722
All right. lfl have
to be the good wife,

129
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,404
I'll be the best
damned wife there is.

130
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,723
Correction,
best darned wife.

131
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,882
Sorry,
I'm a better wife than that.

132
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,243
Andy,
I need to talk to you.

133
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,802
Yeah. Come on in. I'm just on
hold with another talent agency.

134
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,122
Ifsinsane. This promo
with me playing banjo

135
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,850

136
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,924
And every time I click,
there's more. 251.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,764
252. I can't even keep up!

138
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,649
Stanley is refusing
to go out on a sales call.

139
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,649
I hate people.

140
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,484
Why do they never do
what you need them to do?

141
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,891
Stanley has to go,
that's final.

142
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,246
So what I'm hearing
you say is,

143
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,846
make Stanley go out on this sales
call by whatever means possible?

144
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,490
Yes!

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,764
I'm sorry I'm being curt.
It's just,

146
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,604
I'm about to land
a top talent agent.

147
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,761
Mmm-hmm.

148
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,524
Good luck.

Back. Directory.

152
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,445
For five years I've held
my instincts in check,

153
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,204
because I wanted
to be made manager.

154
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,888
Maybe it's time for me
to just let that thought go.

155
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,442
It's kind of painful, but
it's also freeing, in a way.

156
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,490
Now it's all
about my instincts.

157
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,446
Hey, Dwight.
Stanley.

158
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,682
One way or another, you
are going to come with me

159
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,807
to make this sale.

160
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,211
Pass.

161
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,244
Hey, can you just let me out of
here before whatever comes next?

162
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,970
Don't worry, it's just
a bull tranquilizer.

163
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,326
Nothing to be
alarmed about,

164
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,767
it's just a man pointing a bull
tranquilizer at a co-worker.

165
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,406
Dwight, you do not
learn, do you?

166
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,561
For a threat to be
credible, you have...

167
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,170
Holy

168
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,843
No, you didn't. I'm sick of
you and your...

169
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,243
It's all right.
Andy approved it.

170
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,921
Man, he is really
in twinkle town now.

171
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,042
Is he going to be okay?

172
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,691
I mean, weren't those darts
intended for an animal, like,

173
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,888
two to three times
larger than him?

174
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,009
Okay, this dosage was meant
for a very small bull,

175
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,684
and Stanley's got way more
body fat than they do.

176
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,928
You gave him three shots.

177
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,444
We've got
about 45 minutes

178
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,522
to get him to the client
before he comes to.

179
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,602
Grab his feet.

180
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,923
Let's go! Move it!
All right.

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,650
One, two, three!

182
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,211
He's like a manatee.

183
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,328
Ready? Let's go again. Come on.

184
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,248
We can do this.
One, two, three!

185
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,288
Oh, God.

186
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,681
No wonder my elevator cables
are under such strain.

187
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,529
We got to get a
wheelbarrow or something.

188
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,041
Yes.

189
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,246
Okay, we're good.
We're good.

190
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,010
Let's go.
Oh, my God.

191
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,447
Push!
lam!

192
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,245
Any big weekend plans?

193
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,606
I might see a movie.

194
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,808
Nice.
What about you?

195
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,406
Uh, I don't know yet.
I was thinking about...

196
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,051
Just go right to the top
of the stairs, okay?

197
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,566
And then what?

198
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,563
Okay, listen.

199
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,005
I'm kind of embarrassed
to admit this,

200
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,526
but I've never actually
done this before.

201
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,446
Well, if I may,
you're a natural.

202
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,167
Thank you.

203
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,005
I mean, I've rehearsed it in my head,
like, a thousand times, but...

204
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,122
That's a little weird.

205
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,362
I know, Evel Knievel.

206
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,130
Okay, that's about as good
as that's going to be.

207
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,929
Okay,
now here's the plan.

208
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,371
I'm going to launch him.
I need you to go down

209
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,601
to the bottom
and catch him.

210
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,011
Catch?
Yeah.

211
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,809
I can't catch him.
He's like, 250 pounds.

212
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,366
Use your hands and
just blunt his descent.

213
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,249
Okay? He's going to be
moving slowly... Blunt?

214
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,723
It's 15 feet down, it's at a 45 degree
angle. Get set in your haunches.

215
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,881
It's like you're
catching a medicine...

216
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,325
Dude, the size
of my haunches...

217
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,247
Okay, good call.

218
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,606
He would have put
a hole in your chest,

219
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,011
same as he put
a hole in that wall.

220
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,651
We should probably call a
doctor or something, dude.

221
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,401
You Okay?

222
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,761
So, how does it work?

223
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,683
Is it like, you know,
the action of talking

224
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,331
to a third party breaks
up the logjam, or...

225
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,084
You're really there
to talk to each other.

226
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,563
I'd say the therapist
is more of a facilitator.

227
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,080
Mmm.

228
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,648
He might start by
asking each of you,

229
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,245
"Why do you think
you're here?"

230
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,204
He took this job in Philly
without telling me.

231
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,328
He bought our house
without telling me.

232
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,051
At a certain point, he shouldn't
be rewarded for that.

233
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,363
If I didn't do certain
things without telling Pam,

234
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,091
she'd be married to Roy.

235
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,401
I feel like he's always making
these decisions for the family,

236
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,323
and then I'm left
playing catch up.

237
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,725
If she can just hang on
for a little while longer...

238
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,723
This will be
so huge for our family.

239
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,922
Well,
what's a little while?

240
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,168
What do you mean? I mean,
what's the end date?

241
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,971
I mean, it must be really hard for
her to sign on to be unhappy,

242
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,441
if she doesn't know
when it's going to end.

243
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,245
That's kind of
an impossible question.

244
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,530
Oh, guys,
it's starting, hurry!

245
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,888
Oh, there's Angela!

246
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,086
I work with her!

247
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,400
Yeah.

248
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,161
I mean, I'm happy Angela's the
first one getting famous, but...

249
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,405
That's a little weird, no?
I mean, she can't sing or act,

250
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,643
so it's actually kind of
insane, if you think about it.

251
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,966
Her hair looks beautiful.

252
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,642
Yeah, we get it, Phyllis! She
looks like a freaking movie star!

253
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,681
I would just like to start by
saying there have been some rumors

254
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,084
about my personal life that I would
like to settle once and for all.

255
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,766
As my long-suffering
wife can attest,

256
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,285
I am gay-

257
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,806
Senator, were you always
gay, or did your wife turn you gay?

258
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,325
Question for
the Senator's beard.

259
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,767
I'll say it again for mis amigos latinos.
Yo soy homosexual!

260
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,126
Poor Angela.

261
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,641
Yeah, poor Angela.

262
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,731
I once believed that a gay person
could be somewhat straight.

263
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,327
It wasn't until
my marriage to Angela

264
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:59,123
that I realized how charmless
I find the female body.

265
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,601
Ooh! Always hurts
to hear that one.

266
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,084
There is someone else I need to thank.
His name is Oscar Martinez.

267
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,770
Come on!

268
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,209
Oscar is the one who opened
my eyes to who I really am.

269
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,642
For the first... Oscar is
with the Senator, too?

270
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,202
Yes! And I knew it
the whole time!

271
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,729
I kept a secret,
I kept a secret so good!

272
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,691
You didn't know, and you didn't
know, and you didn't freaking know.

273
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,410
But I knew!

274
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,811
He knew!
Yes.

275
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,961
We did it!

276
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,206
You did it, Kevin.

277
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,645
Yes!

278
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,201
Oh!

279
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,762
I did it.
Oh, I did it.

280
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,928
And with my new
self-awareness,

281
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,210
I was finally able
to find love at long last,

282
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,605
with my amazing Chief of
Staff, Wesley Silver.

283
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,087
What?
Wesley Silver is gay?

284
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,961
Whoa!

285
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,445
They make a nice couple.

286
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,241
Almost there,
almost there.

287
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,685
Okay. We're running late,
let's get him inside.

288
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,001
We can't just leave him
bubble wrapped like this.

289
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,360
Are you kidding me?

290
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,521
The bubble wrap
is the only thing

291
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,364
that's stopping his suit
from getting wrinkled.

292
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,727
These meetings are
all about presentation.

293
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,689
That's actually really smart.
Thank you.

294
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,922
God, if only there
was any other use

295
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,650
or situation for
that kind of knowledge.

296
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,807
Let's get him inside.

297
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,724
Carla Fern is not
just an actor's agent.

298
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,361
She does writers, directors,
travel and real estate.

299
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,721
Actor?

300
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,691
Oh, no.

301
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,889
Well, I have an act.
Dog-Cat-Mouse.

302
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,803
Yeah, wow. Cool.

303
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,366
Is it hard
to train them to do that?

304
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,323
Mmm... You go
through a lot of mice.

305
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,051
It started by accident, actually,
as these things tend to do.

306
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,366
You know,
I was setting down my cat

307
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,010
and I accidentally
put her on top of my dog,

308
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,761
and I was, like, so mad at myself at first.
And then I was, like, wait.

309
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,842
Wait a second.

310
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,886
Does anything go
on top of the mouse?

311
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,721
Yeah.

312
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,645
A little hat. Yeah.
Oh, that's cute.

313
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,091
What's the mouse's name?

314
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,004
You know, it really doesn't
make sense to name the mice.

315
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,888
They're kind of like
cannon fodder, you know?

316
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,169
You're not one of those
PETA guys, are you?

317
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,083
Well...
Oh, great.

318
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,607
Wait, wait.
How are we doing this?

319
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,011
Well, I'll grab the forelegs,
and you push his hindquarters.

320
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,560
Just say arms and legs,
okay? That's just...

321
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,165
That's the vernacular
that I'm comfortable with.

322
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,651
Fine. Let's go.

323
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,531
Hoist his shank!
On three!

324
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,364
What's a shank?
It's by the tenderloin.

325
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,967
Roll him. Roll him.
Okay, good, good.

326
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,168
Okay, careful.
He's slouching. Okay.

327
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,890
Can you slouch him
into the seat?

328
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,684
Here, go around,
get the seatbelt.

329
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,881
All right.

330
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,965
Got it?
Yeah.

331
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,485
Y9K)-

332
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,371
Get in the back.

333
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,209
What?
Get in the back.

334
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,282
Oh, come on!
Get in.

335
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,487
Damn it.

336
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,169
Okay, Stanley, do you understand
what we're about to do?

337
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,241
Hello.

338
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,367
Okay.
There's nobody there.

339
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,761
Hey, listen, listen.

340
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,407
We are going to go
discuss paper contracts

341
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,404
for City of Lackawanna
Public Schools, okay?

342
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,086
Pigeons. Oh, God. This is bad.

343
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,527
Looks like
we've got no choice.

344
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,171
You, my friend, are going to
have to be Stanley Hudson.

345
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,606
Isn't the client, like, best
friends with his sister?

346
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,964
New plan, okay?

347
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,407
We get him a cup of coffee and
we go back to the old plan.

348
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,289
Let's go.
Give me a hand.

349
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,084
Here we go!
Come on, Stanley!

350
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,370
Here we go! Upsie-doozy, there we go.
Okay, all right.

351
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,727
Come on, big guy.
You can walk, right?

352
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,121
Yeah, what a pretty smile.
Let's go.

353
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,285
I'm sure Athlead
will be a huge success,

354
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,964
but I don't want him
to do it anymore,

355
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,565
and I don't want
to give him an ultimatum,

356
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,041
but I am not moving
our family to Philly.

357
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,204
Well, if Pam says she won't go,

358
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,602
then we're going to need a
lot more than counseling.

359
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,370
That was exhausting.

360
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,283
Blah, blah, blah.

361
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,641
Jim.

362
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,364
Well, they deserve each other.
They do.

363
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,921
That they do. That they do.
That is for sure.

364
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,766
And for your... Oh! Whoopsie daisy!
There.

365
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,922
Stanley,
what is going on here?

366
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,321
He's fine. He gets
carsick really easily.

367
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,601
The drive.
It was a long drive.

368
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,170
He was in the back seat.

369
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,844
But right now, we're talking to Mrs.
Davis

370
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,928
about the full range of the
products that we offer,

371
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,241
and our competitive rates.
Right, Stanley?

372
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,805
Ooh!
Look at that baby!

373
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,927
Stanley.

374
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,286
Oh...

375
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,281
That's Benji
in the middle.

376
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,762
That's Benji.
Oh, he's precious.

377
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,922
That's a healthy
looking baby.

378
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,246
A very special little boy.

379
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,367
Mmm...

380
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,802
Look at him! I've never seen
such a beautiful child!

381
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,927
He has a funny
sense of humor.

382
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,445
If you push his nose,
he'll go, llEee-ll

383
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,010
Like this? Watch... Eee!

384
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,281
Like that.

385
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,691
A beautiful family.

386
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,087
Right? Come on!

387
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,168
Come on! DWIGHT: Yeah? Maybe
I'll never be manager.

388
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,370
But I just managed to get
our most stubborn salesman

389
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,807
to close a sale with one
of our biggest clients.

390
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,089
And I must say, it's the most
pleasant I've ever seen Stanley.

391
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,605
I think we should
consider injecting him

392
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,688
with bull tranquilizer
on a daily basis.

393
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,684
So, what can you do?

394
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,930
Well, what can't I do, right?

395
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,480
I can sing,
I can dance,

396
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,961
I can play the banjo, innit?

397
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,568
And if you hadn't noticed, I got
a pretty good British accent.

398
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,806
Can you drive a car?

399
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,963
At the risk of sounding arrogant,
I did drive myself here.

400
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,728
Why do you have a high school
musical here on your resume?

401
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,201
What are you,
like, 40, 45?

402
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,647
My exact age
is 28 to 34,

403
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,006
so basically
just send me out

404
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,684
on whatever Jake
Gyllenhaal's going out on.

405
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,241
Gyllenhaal, got it.
Can you juggle and crap?

406
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,971
Yes, and yes.

407
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,249
Would you dress up as say,
a birthday clown,

408
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,290
and go to a kid's party and
let them throw pies atyou?

409
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:38,129
Whereas that is not why I
have entered show business,

410
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,285
I do understand that you
have to build credibility.

411
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,247
I'm all for it.

412
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,607
Well, Mr. Bernard,
I'll be honest with you.

413
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,889
Well, at least I tried.
Thank you very much.

414
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,607
Oh. No. We're going to
take you on as a client.

415
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,326
You are?

416
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,931
Yes! Yes!

417
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,727
Are you being
for real right now?

418
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,325
Oh, man.

419
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,640
Ah. Yes!

420
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,285
I need this so bad.

421
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,410
I really think this
is what could fix me.

422
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,010
We are extremely excited to
be working with you too, sir.

423
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,487
Pay Todd on your way out.

424
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,763
Most talent agents take 10%
of whatever jobs they get you.

425
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:34,041
But with Carla, you pay a
flat rate of $5,000 up front.

426
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,566
And that includes headshots.

427
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,051
Oh, it doesn't
include headshots.

428
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,565
Itdoesn%
include headshots.

429
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,962
Well, of course not, because
that would be insane if it did.

430
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,690
I'm still getting
a bargain, though.

431
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,604
So I just smiled and
complimented her grandkids

432
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,444
and we closed it?

433
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,885
You earned yourself
a nice, fat commission

434
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,804
and you didn't
even know it.

435
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,491
I'll go tell Andy
the good news.

436
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,528
Oh, silly me.

437
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,450
Got to take the stairs. Oh, no.
I'm not doing that again.

438
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,522
You got me down, you
got to get me back up.

439
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,290
No, no.

440
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,488
We need a winch
and a hoist.
