1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,607
Hey, I feel so lucky we're in the
same city for Valentine's Day.

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,045
It's like magic.

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,730
Or it's like me getting
on my hands and knees

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,451
and begging my partners to
switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,965
Alakazam.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,248
By the way, they do need
an extra day next week.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,562
And poof, he disappears.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,005
Hey. Want to may
hooky today'?

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,447
Maybe. What do you
got in mind?

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,886
We can do
anything you want.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,325
I really want to
have fun today,

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,165
because tomorrow
is going to be a nightmare.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,847
Andy's coming back from his
stupid, dumb boat trip.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,161
He's been rude,
he's been selfish,

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,483
I think he's a big jerk,
and I'm breaking up with him.

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,962
Bam, Andy!
How do you like me now?

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,560
I hope as a friend.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,682
Erin says she's gonna break up
with Andy, but I'm not sure.

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,282
He's coming back tomorrow,
and surprise,

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,402
today she wants to
do whatever I'd like.

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,641
You know, when I was a kid we
had a dog who got real sick,

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,371
and we had to
send him to a farm.

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,601
And on his last day,
we did everything he loved.

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,002
Want to play catch
in the parking lot?

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,370
Sure.
Great.

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,244
Get my coat.
Perfect.

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,881
Come in.

28
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,885
Andy, hi, I just made
another huge sale

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,490
for the company
that you manage,

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,642
so I need you to authorize
that expense report

31
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,404
and sign off
on that contract.

32
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,330
I would be happy to.

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,687
It would be my pleasure,
Mr. Schrute.

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,965
I really like Andy
these days.

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,805
He's pretend, and he does
exactly as I tell him to.

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,886
All that will change when real
Andy comes back tomorrow.

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,126
Unless he comes
back as pretend Dwight.

38
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,687
In which case, we're in for
an epic, confusing showdown.

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,250
Andy left a carton
of milk in the fridge,

40
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,527
so I've been
sneaking a little bit

41
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,802
every day for
the last three months.

42
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,041
It's been yummy.

43
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,366
But now Andy's coming back.

44
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,848
So, I guess it's goodbye,
chunky lemon milk.

45
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,725
Okay, I'll say it.

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,131
I wish Andy had
stayed on his trip.

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,841
I say we all have one
last fun, boss-less day.

48
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,607
Yeah, let's get some
booze and some cocaine

49
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,087
and just blow it out,
no consequences.

50
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,207
Or the mini-mall.

51
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,403
They have all these
Valentine Day deals.

52
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,528
And you get 20%
off if you come in

53
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,762
with your husband
or your boyfriend.

54
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,167
But I mean, if you
don't have one of those,

55
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,083
you can probably
just bring whoever

56
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,083
it is you use to
kill your loneliness.

57
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,685
Phyll, I'll pretend
to be your husband.

58
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,240
I'm already sick of you,
so it'll seem realistic.

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,407
Oh. They have a nail salon there
where I get my feet detailed.

60
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,164
They use
a watch repair kit.

61
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,286
I'll be your foot buddy.

62
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,886
Everyone, it is our last day
here with no manager.

63
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,644
I say we go to the mini-mall.

64
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,451
Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend
so I can get the discount.

65
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,601
That's what I do.

66
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,601
Let's do it.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,843
Darryl, everyone
seems to be pairing off.

68
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,002
Do you want to pretend to be
a couple so we get the...

69
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,081
No.

70
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,769
Yes. Yes.
Why wouldn't I?

71
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,691
I wanna pretend to be gay.
I got no problem with that.

72
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,001
All right, it'll be easy. Don't
be nervous, just follow...

73
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,168
Stop talking about it.
I said I'm fine with it.

74
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,363
These are gross.
They are terrible.

75
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,049
Hey, don't fill up
on chocolates.

76
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,566
I made us a lunch reservation
at State Street Grill.

77
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,287
Oh, my God.
That's so romantic.

78
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,686
It's with
Brian and Alyssa.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,162
Oh, my God.
That's less romantic.

80
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,971
I know,
but we should go.

81
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,805
We need to thank him for,
you know, saving my life.

82
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,207
Yeah, yeah, no, totally.
That's good.

83
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,365
So should we just get a bottle
of wine later and celebrate?

84
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,806
That sounds nice.

85
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,845
I'm very excited
to see Brian.

86
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,731
Brian's a great guy, and Pam
and I have gotten really close

87
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,326
to he and his wife Alyssa
over the years, and...

88
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,210
He got fired for protecting my
wife from a jerk in the warehouse.

89
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,451
I'm sorry, but you know him.
He's a good guy.

90
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,762
Tiny foot lady is back.

91
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,285
Get the baby clipper.

92
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,284
You take off
your glasses.

93
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,121
Okay-

94
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,281
What?

95
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,966
Your boyfriend.
He look like a pretty girl.

96
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,404
My boyfriend does look like
a pretty girl, doesn't he?

97
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,005
Yes, a very little
pretty girl.

98
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,489
And you know what?
I think you are developing.

99
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,562
We should go and get
you a training bra.

100
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,609
You guys both
think this is funny?

101
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,404
Well, you know what?
No more discount.

102
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,484
Excuse me!
What? Shush!

103
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,005
Full price.
We're not together.

104
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,571
Come on.

105
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,120
She's living a lie.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,924
Turns out I can't even be
in a pretend relationship.

107
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,564
Hi. We'd like the couples discount
on a pair of foot massages.

108
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,241
No, no discount
for two men.

109
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,165
Two men are
not a couple.

110
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,809
We are together,
romantically.

111
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,411
Two men.

112
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,686
Doesn't work.
No discount.

113
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,171
It works.

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,606
Him and me, all right,
we are crazy in love.

115
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,851
More in love than your
small mind can comprehend.

116
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,242
And we have two disposable
incomes and no kids,

117
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,924
and we're taking our
business elsewhere.

118
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,961
Hey.
Hey, Brian.

119
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,121
Hey-

120
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,601
Sorry we're late.

121
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,805
No problem.
I finished all the bread.

122
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,449
Yeah, okay.

123
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,521
What?

124
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,284
He's on a no-carb thing,
supposedly.

125
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,042
It's great to see you guys.
Thanks for coming.

126
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,087
Yeah.
Are you kidding?

127
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,241
Thank you, man,
I mean,

128
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,209
I've wanted the opportunity
to say thanks for

129
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,082
everything, and I'm really
sorry about the job.

130
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,650
That just seems crazy.

131
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,921
It's fine.
What are you gonna do?

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,004
But if you guys know of any
work, I'm fully available.

133
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,970
Well, my dad
can't hear a thing.

134
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,605
You could boom his
whole life for him.

135
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,206
Okay, great.
Does he pay well?

136
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,247
Where's Alyssa?

137
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,011
You know, Alyssa's... She's
not gonna make it today.

138
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,161
Oh.

139
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,562
Actually,
we're not gonna make it.

140
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,601
We're splitting up.

141
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,527
I have yet another
sales order for you to sign.

142
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,889
Why, thank you, Mr. Schrute.
I don't know how you do it.

143
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,326
You're a god.

144
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,521
Hi, Dwight.

145
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,761
You're back.

146
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,207
And you're disgusting.

147
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,606
Jeez. My nails
aren't dry yet.

148
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,207
I don't think I can work
for at least a couple hours.

149
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,841
Well, well, well,
look who it is.

150
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,445
Andy.
I guess I can cancel

151
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,844
my order from zappos.com because
the loafers have arrived.

152
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,201
Hey! Sweetheart!

153
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,882
I missed you so much.

154
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,562
Yes. Welcome back, buddy.

155
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,290
I have been dreaming
of this moment.

156
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,204
Me, too.
So much. I'm so happy.

157
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,171
I am really,
really bad at breakups.

158
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,120
Technically, I'm still dating
my first-grade boyfriend.

159
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,044
I mean, we just had
our 20th anniversary.

160
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,209
And I forgot to
get him something.

161
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,004
What happened? We thought you
were coming back tomorrow.

162
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,563
Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin.
Hello. Super romantic.

163
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,211
And I got you something.

164
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,408
It's a couple of pieces
of bamboo, big deal, right?

165
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,722
No, these are
musical instruments.

166
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,564
It's so we can play
island music together.

167
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,888
'Cause I have this.

168
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,686
Clop the cloppers.

169
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,321
Yeah, clop 'em.
It's called bembe.

170
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,326
Hey, burning man, if it's
not selling out too much,

171
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,851
you might wanna
throw on a tie.

172
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,923
David Wallace is
gonna be here in an hour.

173
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,083
Obviously,
that's why I'm here.

174
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,081
I mean, I came back
early to surprise Erin.

175
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,845
Happy Valentine's Day,
sweetheart.

176
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,208
But I'm just saying I'm also
excited about the Wallace meeting.

177
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,890
Why? Isn't he just
coming in to rip you

178
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,610
a new one for being
gone three months?

179
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,370
No, please,
come on, Clark.

180
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,568
Wallace knows that he's been
gone for the last three months.

181
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,041
Right?

182
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,761
Wallace does know that you've been
gone for the last three months?

183
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,560
I have no idea. I don't know
what he knows or doesn't know.

184
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,201
But we've been in
touch the whole time.

185
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,964
I mean, it's not
hard to get high-speed

186
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,809
Internet in Turks
and Caicos, people.

187
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,805
It's in every bembe cafe.

188
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,644
He only e-mailed me
four times.

189
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,084
Question. Where's Jim?

190
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,647
He and Pam are having
their Valentine's Day lunch.

191
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,051
For two hours, really?

192
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,845
So, you're concerned

193
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,969
about peoples' long absence
from their place of work.

194
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,486
If the shoe fits...

195
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,847
We were telling two different
versions of the same story,

196
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,048
and then everything
just went numb.

197
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,283
Well, I mean, that's okay. It
doesn't mean that it's over, right?

198
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,725
I mean, couples fight.

199
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,841
Yeah, and that's the thing.

200
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,081
When we were fighting,

201
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,242
it weirdly felt like the
relationship was still alive.

202
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,962
And it wasn't until we stopped
fighting that we realized it was over.

203
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,440
It's over.

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,049
I'm sorry, this is...
Oh, my God, okay.

205
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,602
We have to stop seeing
each other like this.

206
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,603
We have to find a different
way to communicate

207
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,523
other than breaking down
in front of each other.

208
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,244
Yeah.
What?

209
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,130
At least my crying
won't get you fired.

210
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,041
Crying?

211
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,523
I notice that you landed the
Scranton White Pages account

212
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,681
That is tremendous.

213
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,887
Thank you.

214
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,201
And you sold it to Jan,
too, I mean... Yes.

215
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,928
I'm impressed.
Yeah.

216
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,361
Well, there's one problem.

217
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,488
Couldn't help but notice
that you offered a price point

218
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,602
that was not approved
by the head office.

219
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,570
So, gotta run that
stuff by me, Dwight.

220
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,881
You were on a boat.

221
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,481
I was...

222
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,211
On a boat in the ocean.

223
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,891
Okay, the issue is that you
need to run this stuff by me.

224
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,686
Coolio?

225
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,690
Are we coolio?

226
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,002
Just say the word "coolio."
I'm not gonna say it.

227
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,121
Say it.
Not a word.

228
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,201
Coolio.
No.

229
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,801
What do you
think you're doing?

230
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,326
Just gonna call the Scranton White
Pages and clear this right up.

231
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,890
Don't you dare, Andy.

232
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,486
Hello?
Hey, Jan. Nard Dog here.

233
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,561
Hi, Andy.

234
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,880
I was just looking
over the paperwork.

235
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,200
I found a little hiccup.
Really?

236
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,442
Yeah, it appears my
employee offered you

237
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,767
a price that he was
not authorized to.

238
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,241
Coolio.

239
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,731
Seriously? You're
calling me a few weeks

240
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,531
after finalizing our contract
to gouge me now for more money?

241
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,204
Is that what you're doing?
Coolio. I'm coolio.

242
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,443
No, no, no, Jan, I think
you misunderstood. Yeah.

243
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,931
It's actually
justanissueu.

244
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,650
You know what, Nard Dog?

245
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,166
There is an option
in the contract

246
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,363
that allows me to back out
within 30 days of signing,

247
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,011
so I would like to
exercise that option.

248
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,282
No, Jan, please do
not listen to this boob!

249
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,006
Remember Clark. He gave you everything.
Everything.

250
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,525
Jan, I don't know what
he's talking about, but...

251
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,364
Tell Angela to send
me a final invoice.

252
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,840
Please, Jan...

253
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,851
That was not

254
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,003
how I had hoped
that would go.

255
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,040
Hey, everybody. Greatjob.

256
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,602
Listen, we're a smidge behind
on my paychecks.

257
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,931
Yes, well, as you know,
we get paid on Fridays.

258
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,011
And you haven't been
here for 12 Fridays.

259
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,363
All right.
Thank you very much.

260
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,081
Looking good.

261
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,601
Who's that little fellow?

262
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,923
It's a bonus check
for you from Wallace.

263
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,370
Because the branch exceeded its
targets over the past quarter.

264
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,324
Wow, that's wonderful.

265
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,402
Quarter's three months. That's
how long you've been gone.

266
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,084
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

267
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,561
Mm-hmm.

268
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,446
Thank you.

269
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,084
Great, well,
we're all up to speed.

270
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,804
Two seconds
of the turd dog,

271
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,087
and he loses the biggest sale
this branch has ever seen.

272
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,609
Do you have any idea what I had
to do to get that sale from Jan?

273
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,445
I mean, I went all out.

274
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,967
All out. I mean like everything
was out the whole week.

275
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,483
He just waltzes back in here like
he owns the chunky lemon milk.

276
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,126
Who needs him, right?

277
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,567
God, I just don't know
what we do.

278
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,804
I mean, short of
telling David Wallace

279
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,769
that he was gone
for three months.

280
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,246
I'd like to rat out Andy,

281
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,560
but unfortunately
I have a bit of

282
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,120
a "boy who cried wolf"
dynamic with David Wallace.

283
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,487
Except instead of
a boy I'm a man,

284
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,245
and instead of a wolf,
I cried,

285
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,848
"Genetically-engineered
monster wolf."

286
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,647
I'm not gonna rat on him.
Andy gave me a second chance.

287
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,882
So the least I could do is let
somebody else rat on him.

288
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,721
Meredith, why don't you?

289
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,644
Meredith Palmer ain't never
been called no narc.

290
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,888
Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check.

291
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,724
Einstein sarcastically?
You bet.

292
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,609
But never no narc.

293
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,207
Vomit mop? Sure.
Floor meat? That's me.

294
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,486
Flesh hoover? Hi.
Hey...

295
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,324
Meredith, that's plenty.

296
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,449
All right?
That's more than plenty.

297
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,600
Why does no one
stop her?

298
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,809
Guys, I know that a lot of
people are mad at Andy,

299
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,166
and believe me, lam, too.

300
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,450
But he has been through a lot, and
we all used to love him, right?

301
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,045
So, if he's gonna
get in trouble,

302
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,685
just let it be
his fault, not ours.

303
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,728
I don't want that on my hands.

304
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,126
Fine.

305
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,687
The state he's in, Wallace
will take one look at him

306
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,603
and probably fire him anyway.

307
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,844
What's going on in here,
dirty players?

308
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,406
Let's get back to
busting some paper rhymes.

309
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,681
Come on.

310
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,968
Who's that girl?

311
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,561
Who's that girl?

312
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,766
It's Andy.

313
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,441
All right. Back to work.

314
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,929
Okay, I can tell
you're mad at me.

315
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,049
Do you want to just,
I don't know, tell me why?

316
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,130
I don't know.

317
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,569
I thought that
was a little weird.

318
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,363
You told me Brian got fired
for the whole warehouse thing.

319
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,967
And you intentionally left out a
kind of major intimate detail.

320
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,047
I don't know, Pam, I guess
I just feel like a chump

321
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,800
who knows less about his
marriage than the sound guy.

322
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,482
I didn't tell you
about the crying because

323
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,768
I didn't want you to
know how upset I was.

324
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,123
Becauseit
would've stressed you out,

325
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,170
and you're always saying how
much you don't want more stress.

326
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,086
Yeah, well, yeah, okay.
Well, then thank you.

327
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,851
Thanks to both of you.

328
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,210
It's not Brian's fault.
No, you're right.

329
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,044
And I'm not mad at Brian.

330
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,407
And to be honest, I probably don't
have any reason to be mad at all

331
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,851
because I wasn't there.

332
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,922
So let's just
forget about it.

333
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,641
Okay-

334
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,450
I need you guys to
tell me all the highlights

335
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,205
from the last three months
in case David asks.

336
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,204
Just a few things I could
sprinkle into conversation.

337
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,648
Any big sales
or office gossip?

338
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,684
Well, we had
the Scranton White Pages.

339
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,569
Not helpful. Let's
stay positive, people.

340
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,841
HeY, guys
Okay?

341
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,202
Hey, David, how are you?

342
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,081
We were just having our weekly round
table where we motivate each other.

343
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,447
I'm not gonna lie. I get as
much out of it as they do.

344
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,090
Sounds great.
Don't let me interrupt.

345
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,162
Whatever you guys have been
doing this last quarter,

346
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,241
I couldn't be
happier with the numbers.

347
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,407
Thank you.

348
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,130
Well, finish up.
I'm gonna meet with Val

349
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,611
about that warehouse guy
you had to let go,

350
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,131
and you and I will
talk in 15 minutes?

351
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,567
Great.
Great job, everybody!

352
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,650
We had to let
a warehouse guy go?

353
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,611
You know Pam's mural?
Well, Frank...

354
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,241
Lit the whole thing on fire.
It was crazy.

355
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,641
- What?
- Yeah.

356
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,801
There was a fire
in the warehouse?

357
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,450
The whole thing
is in ashes.

358
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,484
Fire department was here. It
was in all the papers. Whoa.

359
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,324
This is what
I'm talking about.

360
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,926
This would be good to know.
All right, what else?

361
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,481
We started selling balloons.

362
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,800
What?
Yeah.

363
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,851
And, Kathy Ireland signed on as the
official spokesbabe of Dunder Mifflin.

364
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,921
No kidding.

365
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,128
Yeah, in the European billboards,
she's gonna be topless.

366
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,329
Wow. Go, Kathy.
She's like 50.

367
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,561
They're tasteful.

368
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,841
Good, good. What else?

369
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,202
And who knew the balloon game
would be so lucrative?

370
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,806
And thank God, right? We needed
the income after the fire.

371
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,601
What fire?

372
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,366
The warehouse fire.
Weren't you just down there?

373
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,442
It's like burnt to ashes.

374
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,291
It looked fine to me.

375
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,482
I am speaking metaphorically,
of course.

376
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,765
You know I have lots
of irons in the "fire."

377
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,162
Well, that's one of them,
you know.

378
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,529
Making sure that
the warehouse logistics

379
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,803
is a well-oiled,
properly-stoked fire.

380
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,607
Okay-

381
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,047
Think you'll agree
I explained that pretty well.

382
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,568
Thanks, Andy.
Thank you.

383
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,085
All right. Everyone.

384
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,525
The fish sounds great.

385
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,766
Yeah, I guess.

386
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,161
Really playing
the scales, huh?

387
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,050
Yeah, I don't know. It just sort
of sounds like noise to me now.

388
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,208
You think I need a new fish?
I don't love you anymore.

389
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,566
What?
I still like you.

390
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,120
But you were gone
a really long time,

391
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,407
and you didn't really
e-mail me all that much.

392
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,211
You re-tweeted me a lot,
to be fair.

393
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,521
But I don't love you.

394
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,170
Okay, I get it.

395
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,322
You're unhappy.
I've been gone a long time,

396
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,522
and we lost
a little bit ofjuju,

397
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,364
but you and me,
we have a future.

398
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,323
There is a lot
of love here.

399
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,090
I just said
there isn't love.

400
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,571
On your side.

401
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,169
But there's tons on my side.
It's gushing.

402
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,010
We're just out
of sync right now.

403
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,646
But that's just timing,
and what's timing?

404
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,609
I mean, my parents
lasted 38, 40 years.

405
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,609
They were never happy
at the same time.

406
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,241
I guess.

407
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,848
I mean, what do we have left? Thirty-five,
maybe 40 years, if we're lucky?

408
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,883
I mean, I have spent
a lot of time in the sun.

409
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,166
You got really sunburned.

410
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,601
I'm gonna be a prune in,
like, three years. Ugh.

411
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,571
I know you may not be feeling
love for me right now,

412
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,729
but if you fake it, I won't be
able to tell the difference.

413
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,051
So I'll feel good.

414
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,848
And then eventually, maybe, you'll
actually start to love me again.

415
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,651
You really think we can
get that back? Yes.

416
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,881
Come on.

417
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,961
Totally.

418
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,843
You know what? Maybe we should
cancel that bottle of wine tonight.

419
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,401
Oh?

420
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,849
Yeah, I just feel like I got a
bunch of stuff to do in Philly,

421
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,127
and I'm sure you have stuff
to do, so we can just...

422
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,804
Drop me
at the bus station?

423
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,401
Are you sure?

424
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,490
I just feel like
we're gonna fight.

425
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,251
Yeah.

426
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,171
So...

427
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,041
How about let's not?

428
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,207
Okay-

429
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,885
Oh, um...

430
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,606
Happy Valentine's Day.

431
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,682
Sorry. I didn't
have time to wrap it.

432
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,121
Wow.

433
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,045
I didn't know
you kept this.

434
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,281
Yeah. Yeah.

435
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,328
Thank you.
No problem.

436
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,289
I don't think you
should go to Philly tonight.

437
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,651
I think that you should stay,
and I think we should fight.

438
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,207
You really want to fight
on Valentine's Day?

439
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,521
Yeah, I do.

440
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,246
Okay-

441
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,042
All right, put your
dukes up, Beesly.

442
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,841
Hi.

443
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,401
Hey. you okay?

444
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,126
I couldn't do it.

445
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,561
Oh.

446
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,441
I'm sorry.

447
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,610
You don't
have to apologize.

448
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,403
I just want you
to be happy, okay?

449
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,681
We're breaking up.

450
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,928
And just so you know, I was
worried that you were dead.

451
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,847
You were gone
for three months.

452
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,284
Andy? David. Still here.

453
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,610
What was that
about three months?
