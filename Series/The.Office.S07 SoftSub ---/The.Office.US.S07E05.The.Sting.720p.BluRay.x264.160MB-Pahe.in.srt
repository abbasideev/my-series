1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,964
Look at that, huh? Nice!

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:05,761
I love cycling.

3
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:07,635
Andy, I feel like
a tourist in my own city.

4
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:09,197
I literally can't wait
to wake up every morning.

5
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,070
Okay.
She is a beaut.

6
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,578
Can't beat a horse. A horse
is a bike that pedals itself.

7
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:14,772
Yes, it is.

8
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:15,905
Look at that, smooth roll.

9
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:17,279
- Yeah.
- You got it!

10
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,408
Lance Armstrong's bike.

11
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:19,473
Yes!

12
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,646
His ass was on that seat?
All right! Nice.

13
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,314
No, Meredith, it's
not his actual bicycle.

14
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,018
But it is the same
exact model he uses.

15
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:28,923
I'm on Sheryl Crow's
side in that whole thing,

16
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,724
so I feel really
weird right now.

17
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,162
- Michael!
- Oh, God!

18
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,324
Yes, I can ride a bike.

19
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:38,029
I take spinning classes
three times a month.

20
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:40,128
I think I know
how to ride a bike.

21
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:41,638
Are you sure you once
knew how to do this?

22
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,005
I did, yes!

23
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:46,944
I had those extra wheels on
the back that support you.

24
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,776
Michael!
Michael!

25
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,106
Michael! Michael!

26
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,172
Michael! Michael!

27
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,342
Michael! Michael!

28
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:53,442
Michael! Yeah!

29
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:54,543
- All right!
- Yeah!

30
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,609
Just steer more now.

31
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:56,712
Oh, my God!

32
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,313
Not the car!
No, no.

33
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:04,924
You never forget.

34
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:31,554
How do I look?

35
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:32,921
Amazing.
How do I look?

36
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,384
Normal. Ugly.

37
00:01:36,028 --> 00:01:37,893
Well, I do the best
with what I've got.

38
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,761
Let's go.
All right.

39
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:44,102
Wait, wait, wait, wait for me. It's
weird if I come in slightly after.

40
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:48,171
We have a big meeting with the chief
buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.

41
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,209
He's not "the" Steve Nash.
He's...

42
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,301
He's big, though. He's kind of
like Scranton's Steve Nash.

43
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,869
Will you stop trying to put it in
terms you think they'll understand?

44
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:55,971
It's condescending.

45
00:01:56,048 --> 00:01:57,709
I'm not doing that.
I'm just explaining.

46
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,344
And who is this
"the" Steve Nash?

47
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,554
Phoenix Suns' point guard?

48
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,987
No.
No? Nothing?

49
00:02:04,056 --> 00:02:05,956
No, Mr. Jock Hipster.

50
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,755
Well, I'm neither of
those things, so...

51
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,018
Oh ho.

52
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,127
Libby Dirketts got married.

53
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,997
Big, red mazel tov
to the Libster.

54
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:17,591
Ooh.

55
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,639
It says here Dan Becker fell
off the side of Kilimanjaro

56
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:22,003
in a climbing accident.

57
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,003
It appears Dan's
Sherpa survived

58
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:25,703
to tell the tale...
Oh, my God!

59
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,139
What? Is Dan okay?

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,872
No, he died.

61
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,540
It's Broccoli Rob.

62
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:32,777
You know this guy. I showed
you his picture on Facebook.

63
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,577
Yes.

64
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:39,250
"Some Vermont-based alums can
hear 'Broccoli' Rob Blatt, '96,

65
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,590
"in the state milk lobby's new
milk awareness song Calci-yum,

66
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,755
"featuring
Phish's Trey Anastasio.

67
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,493
"Says Broccoli, 'Trey and I had
a ton of fun in the studio,

68
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,091
"'and I think you can
hear it in the song."'

69
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,931
Oh, that's great news
for your friend.

70
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:53,337
Yeah. Yeah. It's great.

71
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,432
You know, I forget about milk.
This is a terrific reminder.

72
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,611
I was the artsy musical one.

73
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:06,548
In Here Comes Treble, I had four
solos, Broccoli Rob had three.

74
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,847
Right?

75
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,726
Go tell her we're here. You're
good with receptionists. Ha.

76
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,526
Dwight.

77
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,562
Crap.

78
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,430
Danny Cordray
is the worst.

79
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:29,839
Well, by worst,
you mean the best.

80
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,774
The best salesman ever.

81
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,539
He works for Osprey
Paper over in Throop,

82
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,581
steals more clients from
Dunder Mifflin than anyone.

83
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,275
So the situation
is the worst.

84
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,749
Also, he slept with Pam.

85
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,308
No, he didn't.

86
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,350
Tell them.
Nothing happened.

87
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:49,519
We went on a couple of dates.
He never called me again.

88
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:52,257
What? He never called you? I
thought you said it just fizzled.

89
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:54,822
That's fizzling. I mean, someone
has to start the fizzle.

90
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,163
Yeah, I thought
you started it.

91
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,066
No, I liked him.

92
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,128
For a couple of days.

93
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,730
Four years ago.

94
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,170
You know I have
a kid with you, right?

95
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:06,506
Aah!

96
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,781
I'm gonna intimidate him. Okay?

97
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,874
Okay, great.

98
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,578
I'm just gonna watch.
Watch this.

99
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,816
So anyway, she says, "That is the
biggest penis I have ever seen."

100
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,117
And I said, "I know.

101
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,181
"That's why I brought you
to the penis museum,

102
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,751
"where tickets are $1,000."
Well, hello, Danny.

103
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:26,798
Hey, Dwight.
Good to see you. Jim, hey.

104
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:27,992
How are you?
I'm good.

105
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,432
What are you doing?

106
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:30,833
Well, I'm just here
for the coffee.

107
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:33,137
Like hell you are.
Dwight!

108
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,268
He's not just here for the coffee, Jim.
Wake up.

109
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:39,170
Brainstorming
session is now open.

110
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,839
Anyone has an idea...
Hold on.

111
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,883
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello?

112
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:48,086
Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important.
Are you busy?

113
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,746
Oh, hey. No, I'm not busy.
What's up?

114
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,551
You are busy! We're in a meeting!
What?

115
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,717
It's Jim, okay? Yes.

116
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,919
Listen, you gotta
get over here,

117
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,086
'cause we're
pitching Steve Nash

118
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,493
and Danny Cordray's here.

119
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,424
You need the big guns, yes?

120
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:00,931
Yes.
What'd he say?

121
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,865
What did he say?
The big gun thing. Stop.

122
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,335
I will see you in 10.
Bye! Hold tight.

123
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,502
Well, I know
a lot of you thought

124
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,236
that my sales
days were behind me.

125
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,436
And, to be honest,
so did I.

126
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,477
And the only reason
I got out of the sales game

127
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,277
was to be reluctantly
called back in.

128
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,084
You don't look reluctant, Michael.
You look really eager.

129
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:23,781
No, I don't have time for this.
Are you kidding me?

130
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,188
You don't?
No! Okay. All right.

131
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:30,887
Knockity-knock,
Don't knock back

132
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,932
Just kidding, you can knock. It's
your office. Do you have a minute?

133
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,665
I'm very busy with
time-sensitive work.

134
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,631
Not to go all
Sherlock Holmes on you,

135
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:41,263
but I can tell by
the reflection in your glasses

136
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,672
that you're entering points
into weightwatchers. Com.

137
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:46,844
If you don't enter them
immediately, you forget.

138
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:48,702
What?

139
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,944
I'm starting a band,
and I need you on keyboards.

140
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,211
Nah!

141
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,511
I play for pleasure.

142
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:55,981
This is for pleasure.

143
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:57,746
Wouldn't enjoy that.

144
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:58,981
I'm willing to pay you.

145
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,750
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

146
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:02,555
How much?
60 bucks a session.

147
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,152
That's crazy money.

148
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,219
I'll take 40.

149
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:06,286
Yes!

150
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,099
There he is.

151
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,995
Oh, no, that's a male model.

152
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,039
No, that's him.
That...

153
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:16,634
Hello.

154
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,437
Michael Scott,
Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.

155
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,638
Danny Cordray, Osprey Paper.

156
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,771
Nice to meet you.

157
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:23,641
Three of you
guys for one sale?

158
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,184
Yeah, well...
We call it overkill.

159
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,186
Why am I telling
you my strategy?

160
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,480
Well, whatever works for you.

161
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:32,050
Anyway, all right.
All right.

162
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:33,284
Good to see you guys.
Nice to meet you.

163
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,451
Goodbye.

164
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,654
I could swear that
guy was a male model.

165
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,753
He's ready for you.

166
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,819
Oh! Thank you.

167
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,128
All right. On the count
of three, it's show time.

168
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,791
Ready, one, two...
No, I'm not doing that.

169
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,301
I've been in show time
mode since breakfast.

170
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,837
You're not? Okay, all
right, just forget it then.

171
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,770
Show time!
It's show time!

172
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,774
Never mind. Let's go.

173
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,367
When I knock on your door,
you know who it is.

174
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,673
It's Michael Scott.

175
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,407
We've been
together forever, and...

176
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,472
Michael,
I appreciate everything

177
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,609
that Dunder Mifflin has
done for this company.

178
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,518
You know what? You are having some
problems with your loading dock.

179
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:06,422
Are you not? All right, we're going
to deliver to you on weekends.

180
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:08,020
That's very generous, but...

181
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,959
And you know what
else we're gonna do?

182
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,326
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

183
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,127
We are going to offer
you our paper at cost.

184
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,292
I know.

185
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:16,999
I could get in a lot
of trouble for this,

186
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,058
so you'd better
shake my hand right now.

187
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,126
He's not kidding.

188
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,194
Shake it, shake it!

189
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:21,364
Michael, I'm going
with Danny.

190
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,629
Oh.

191
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:24,199
Thanks for coming in.

192
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,944
Okay. Thank you.

193
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:27,171
Thank you.

194
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,915
Jim talked too much.
No, I didn't.

195
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,814
Yes, you did.
Stop it. Just stop it.

196
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:36,184
We did what we should have done.
We just got bested.

197
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,185
Why is there
a door close button

198
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,589
if it doesn't
even close the door?

199
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,562
How do I feel
about losing the sale?

200
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,259
It's like if Michael Phelps
came out of retirement,

201
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,667
jumped in the pool,
belly-flopped and drowned.

202
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,333
You know who we
always lose out to?

203
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:56,738
Staples, the big guys...

204
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,603
Osprey? They're a small company.
They're smaller than we are.

205
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:03,512
What's our excuse?
How do we combat this guy?

206
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:05,043
Stanley, how do we combat him?

207
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,175
We sell better?

208
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,014
Okay. You know what?

209
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,920
You clearly don't care,
so why don't you just leave?

210
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,114
I would like to stay.
This pertains to me.

211
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,989
Why don't you go outside

212
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,528
and take a shot of insulin
and have a nap, okay?

213
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:19,530
Why do you always
assume I have diabetes?

214
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:21,293
I don't know.
Your frame, your build.

215
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,732
Why don't you have
a glass of apple juice

216
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,100
and tell me
you're not a diabetic?

217
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,036
See? I could tell
by the sound you made

218
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,471
when you stood up
that you have...

219
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,940
Okay. Yes, Phyllis?

220
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,135
I could try to seduce him.

221
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,575
Oh, my God!

222
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,045
I know how we can
learn his tricks.

223
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:38,839
What I'm about to show you
is of the utmost secrecy.

224
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,008
Is that your office?

225
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:42,075
Yes, Jim.

226
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,418
And with a little tweaking,
it becomes a different office.

227
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,789
We lure Danny to it and
watch him sell. Oh.

228
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,555
I'm out of here.
This is weird.

229
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:51,687
You know what this is?
This is a stinger.

230
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,231
A what?

231
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,391
Like the movie.

232
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:56,331
I think you mean The Sting.

233
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,165
Paul Newman, Robert Redford.
They're bank robbers?

234
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,431
Nope. Different movie.
It's called The Stinger.

235
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,836
The Sting.

236
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,509
Your 2:00.

237
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:08,837
Thanks, hon.

238
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:11,106
Meredith was
the perfect choice

239
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,276
to play the head
of the company.

240
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,377
Her lunch break lined up with
our appointment with Danny,

241
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,752
and... That's it.

242
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,791
That's really all
we were looking for.

243
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:21,483
Danny Cordray.
It's great to meet you.

244
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,027
Meredith Van Helsing.
Pleased to meet you.

245
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,756
Meredith Van Helsing?

246
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,388
Van Helsing was
a respected professor

247
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,796
before he was
a vampire killer.

248
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,835
Okay. But what is he
more famous for? Shh.

249
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,728
Hey! That's my mug.

250
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,205
You know this
isn't real TV, right?

251
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,707
Yes.

252
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,139
Please, Mr. President

253
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:43,204
If you wanna
Give hope a whirl

254
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:46,046
Bring our troops
Home safe and sound

255
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,177
Says this little girl

256
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,723
Please, Mr. President

257
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:53,584
Wait a second, wait a
second, wait a second.

258
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,651
So, the song is from the point
of view of a little girl?

259
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,319
Yeah.
But you're singing it.

260
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,887
Yeah. But I'm
using my falsetto.

261
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,659
No, that's not a good idea. I
don't see it as a very good song.

262
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,464
Yeah, well, it'd
sound a lot better

263
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:06,231
if you actually
sang with some soul.

264
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,300
I never sing with soul.
That's a lie.

265
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:09,499
I could sing it.

266
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,835
I just was hoping to
maybe save your voice

267
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,902
in case we did a novelty
song about frogs.

268
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,182
But my voice is unique.
Like Bob Dylan.

269
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:18,709
Okay, three-way argument

270
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,513
between a drummer,
a keyboardist,

271
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,247
and the front man,
lead singer.

272
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,856
Wonder who's
gonna win this one.

273
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,152
Two, three, four...

274
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,293
I'm gonna take off my coat,
if you don't mind.

275
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,630
It's just a bit warm in here.

276
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:35,632
Hello!

277
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,191
No, no, no. Don't.

278
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,260
People can't keep their true
natures hidden for long,

279
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,101
and this guy is smoldering
like a tire fire.

280
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,197
Testify.

281
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,571
Okay, he's not
that good-looking.

282
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:44,734
I don't understand
why everybody's...

283
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,141
Yeah, he is that
good-looking. Okay?

284
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:47,473
He's very, very handsome.

285
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,946
That's a great set of
shoulders you got there.

286
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:52,279
What is that, genetics?

287
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,409
Creatine?

288
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:55,644
Sorry.

289
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:58,387
Yeah. Pull it
together, all right?

290
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,254
Stop looking at him.

291
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,657
I'm sorry.

292
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:05,491
You're here to
sell me some paper.

293
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:09,625
Well, actually, no, Miss Van
Helsing, that's not why I'm here.

294
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:13,536
I'm here to meet you, see if
we'd be a, you know, good fit.

295
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,697
What do you mean?

296
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:18,334
Oh, my God!
He's making her sell to him.

297
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,609
Bring our troops
Home safe and sound

298
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,739
Says this little girl

299
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,745
Okay. Honest feedback time.
Oscar.

300
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:30,149
That's pandering. And it makes
me think you think I'm stupid.

301
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,257
But do you think
it could be famous?

302
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,723
Like in a car
commercial or something?

303
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,257
Not really.

304
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,420
It's kind of weird that
a grown man is singing

305
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,555
from the point of view of
a little girl. Mmm-hmm.

306
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:42,122
I feel like I can see
someone ice skating to it,

307
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,032
you know,
like in the Olympics.

308
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:48,699
I don't think they usually
skate to such bad songs.

309
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,638
Rude. And not helpful.

310
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,644
Well, I really,
really, really liked it.

311
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,581
Well, that really
bums me out.

312
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,876
You're welcome.

313
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,714
Well, you should think of
this as a first date.

314
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,051
And I think it's going very well.
How about you?

315
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:05,586
Real well.

316
00:12:05,657 --> 00:12:06,646
Uh...

317
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,953
Feels more like
a third date to me.

318
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,689
There you go!

319
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:13,596
Stay...
Shut up and let me do this!

320
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,926
You know, what is with this
desk keeping us so far apart?

321
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,801
I've never been a desk man.

322
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:24,536
Always traveling on the road.
Come on... Why not? Uh?

323
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,009
Well, we'll get this...

324
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,250
Oh, man.
So, what's your drink?

325
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,882
You a vodka man? Me, too.

326
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,216
We gotta get someone else
in there right now.

327
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,189
You're an exec at
Pennsylvania Solartech.

328
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,384
That sounds fake.

329
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,483
What do you mean?
I told you.

330
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,391
You're an exec at
Stark Industries,

331
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,895
a corporation you
inherited from your father.

332
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:46,362
Will you stop?
Here's the story.

333
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,161
They need Meredith
somewhere else ASAP, okay?

334
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:49,291
Okay.
So you're taking over.

335
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,063
You just gotta get her out
of there as soon as you can.

336
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:52,694
I can do that.
Then what?

337
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:53,863
Then make him pitch to you.

338
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,997
You gotta see what he's got.
Yes.

339
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,473
Exactly. You can do this.
Okay, and remember.

340
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,736
You're not gay.

341
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,970
Stop it.
It's gonna be great.

342
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,979
Listen, if anything else
happens, just roll with it.

343
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:05,338
Meredith, I...

344
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:06,406
Manuel.

345
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:10,046
This is Manuel, my cleaning man.
He doesn't speak any English.

346
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,692
Manuel, cleano el window.

347
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:18,987
Give me the...

348
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,053
Who else we got?

349
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:25,200
Okay. You're a young hotshot
from Stark Industries.

350
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,295
You've just bought this company.
Meredith is fired.

351
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:29,806
It's a whole new regime.
He's gotta pitch to you now.

352
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,809
Okay, Stark Industries
isn't real.

353
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,037
I run Google.

354
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,841
Larry and Sergey brought me...
Great. Sounds awesome.

355
00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:36,608
Just have him pitch to you.
Don't let us down.

356
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,247
Will do. Won't do.

357
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,678
Yeah, sure.

358
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:41,082
You smell like a Scorpio.

359
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,312
This is Esteban,
another cleaning man.

360
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:46,687
He doesn't speak
English either.

361
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:48,726
Esteban, el flooro.

362
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:58,863
You know what? I may have parked
my car in a compact space,

363
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:00,564
and I hate when I see
others do that, so...

364
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,231
Danny, I feel
a real connection to you,

365
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:03,535
and I got to get real.

366
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,598
No. No, no, no.

367
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:05,665
No, no, no, no, no!

368
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:06,904
I'm going in! I'm going in!
Michael!

369
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,412
No, Michael, stop it!
No!

370
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,947
Stop, stop! Oh, my God!

371
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,540
Okay. Stop it,
stop it, stop it.

372
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,212
Gross! Stop it,
please. Everybody stop.

373
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:16,810
Michael Scott.

374
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:17,947
I said stop.

375
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,020
Okay, Danny,

376
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,991
this is not
Pennsylvania Solartech.

377
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:25,086
This is Dunder
Mifflin Paper Company.

378
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,495
This is Meredith Palmer.

379
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:28,088
Pleased to meet you.
Don't... Stay away from him.

380
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,795
Please, just leave. Get out of here.
Go. Forever.

381
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,060
Hmm.

382
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:35,368
I owe you a most sincere
and humble apology.

383
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,443
We were trying to watch you
to see your sales technique

384
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,444
so we could stop losing
so many clients to you.

385
00:14:40,812 --> 00:14:42,006
Watch from where?

386
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,604
A surveillance
room next to this one.

387
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,617
Okay, so you set up
this fake company,

388
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,916
then you hired this homeless woman
to impersonate an executive,

389
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:53,756
to spy on me so that you could
copy my sales technique.

390
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:55,823
Yes. And it's the sincerest
form of flattery.

391
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,452
Or crazy.

392
00:14:57,729 --> 00:14:58,889
Well...
I'm gonna go.

393
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,057
Okay. You know what,
it wasn't just me.

394
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,392
Jim and Dwight
are behind that wall

395
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,069
in the surveillance room, and
it was their plan, as well.

396
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,332
No!
No, no, no, no.

397
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,834
Well, then, yeah.
All right, hey!

398
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,841
Good luck, guys!

399
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,342
Seems like you got
a great operation here.

400
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,902
No, we don't.
Here's... Here's my point.

401
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,340
Danny, listen,
you have to understand

402
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,146
that we are not
normally like this.

403
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,949
We just... We wanted
to know your tricks.

404
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:24,818
What do you mean, tricks?
There's no tricks, man.

405
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,415
I'm just a good salesman. You wanna
copy that? You can't copy that!

406
00:15:27,492 --> 00:15:30,950
You are, you are. You are!
Stop it, stop it. Stop.

407
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:32,087
You are a good salesman.

408
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,563
And because of that

409
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:36,895
I want you to work for me.

410
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,869
Sure. You seem like a fun,
professional guy.

411
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,195
So you will.
No!

412
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,830
Hold it, hold it,
hold it, hold on.

413
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,876
Hold on. Wait, wait,
wait, wait. Wait.

414
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,540
Danny, I want you
to look at me.

415
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,171
Do you want your
life to be better

416
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,910
or to be worse or
to stay the same?

417
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,718
Get out of my way.
Answer the question.

418
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,252
Do you want
a better life, Danny?

419
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,117
I swear to God,
I'm gonna hit you.

420
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,954
I didn't mean that.
I'm sorry. I'm not...

421
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,357
It's just, I'm very upset right now.
I know.

422
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:03,485
I'm very upset!
I know, I know.

423
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:07,054
Do you want more freedom, less
freedom, or to stay the same?

424
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,861
More freedom.
I can give you more money.

425
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,636
There's your better life.

426
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:14,865
I can let you come
and go as you please.

427
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,669
There's your freedom.

428
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,141
And you already
know Dunder Mifflin

429
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,371
has the best service
and the best prices.

430
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:22,436
But you beat us anyway.

431
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:26,610
Can you imagine how well you
would do selling our stuff?

432
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,490
Everyone, may I
have your attention?

433
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:35,720
I would like to introduce you
to Mr. Danny Cordray.

434
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:39,929
He's going to be joining us as
our new traveling salesman.

435
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,497
Say hello to Danny!

436
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,293
Me.

437
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:45,199
Okay. You know what?

438
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,170
No. No.

439
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,868
This is not some sort of
construction site, or all of Italy

440
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:53,035
where you can just go around
treating people like meat.

441
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,711
We are to respect him.

442
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:59,081
I respect him because he
reminds me of somebody.

443
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,379
Can anybody guess who that is?

444
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,708
Josh Duhamel.

445
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:02,845
Yeah, I can see that!

446
00:17:02,954 --> 00:17:05,582
No. No. No.
Somebody in this office.

447
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,750
He's like
a better-looking Andy.

448
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:09,050
Thanks, Kevin.

449
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:10,924
No. Me. Right?

450
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,325
Sort of like a little,
younger version of me.

451
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,927
It's hard to judge ourselves
accurately, isn't it?

452
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,060
Michael.
Yes.

453
00:17:18,136 --> 00:17:19,797
Can I talk to you about something?
No, you may not.

454
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,429
It's about this very
announcement you just made.

455
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:23,133
I said no.
Michael...

456
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,539
Michael, I think you really
want to talk to him.

457
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:27,305
Okay, let's... All right,
all right. Let's talk.

458
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,471
Please don't let him leave.
Don't leave.

459
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,571
Got you.

460
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,013
You hired him?

461
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,107
Guys, let me
ask you something.

462
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,914
Do you want your life to be
better or worse or stay the same?

463
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:36,112
Stay the same.

464
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,089
Okay. Well, get ready,
'cause it's gonna get better.

465
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:41,984
It's not gonna get better. He's
gonna steal all of our clients.

466
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,550
No. No. Wrong.

467
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:45,357
He would have
stolen your clients,

468
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,125
but you know what?
He can't now.

469
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,224
This guy used to
steal sales from us.

470
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,427
Now he's going to
steal sales for us.

471
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,568
Where's he gonna sit?
There's no more seats.

472
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:55,299
He doesn't need to sit.
He's a traveling salesman.

473
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:58,241
Look, I am not going to exclude
good people from our staff

474
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,505
simply because they
are threatening to you.

475
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,378
And unless you have a
better argument than that,

476
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:03,778
I suggest you leave.

477
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:05,438
Yeah.

478
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,645
Where's he gonna park? There's
no more reserved parking spots.

479
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,948
Goodbye!

480
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,890
Songs about truth.
Yeah.

481
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,690
What's something
you really care about?

482
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:19,923
Reverse snobbery.

483
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:21,156
More universal.

484
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,061
Sometimes I feel like
life has passed me by.

485
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:29,305
Couldn't get
Out of bed today

486
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,103
Wish the alarm clock
Would go away

487
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,201
Nice!

488
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,643
Holy crap.
Are you kidding me?

489
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,078
You just made that...
That's amazing.

490
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,206
Go ahead.

491
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,681
Which me am I
Gonna be today?

492
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,049
Which me am I
Gonna be today?

493
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,486
I got a closet full of mes
Ha ha!

494
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,458
Am I gonna be the happy me?

495
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,953
Or the me that stinks?

496
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,854
Oh, my gosh. We're
almost out of time.

497
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,297
How much for
another half hour?

498
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,264
Don't worry about it.

499
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:00,263
Wait. Seriously?
Yeah.

500
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,971
So we're just, like,
jamming as friends?

501
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,640
One, two, three, hit it.

502
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,842
Closet full of mes...

503
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:12,279
Oh, you know, funny, your wife
and I went on a few dates.

504
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,914
Did you?
Yeah, way, way, way back.

505
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:16,317
I'm just kidding.
She told me about it.

506
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,913
Good. She was not into me.

507
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,389
Oh.
Obviously.

508
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,856
I don't even think
she called me back.

509
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,094
You snubbed her.
Dwight, please.

510
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:27,825
Let me handle this, Jim.
Drop the act, Cordray. Okay?

511
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:29,491
We all know that
you probably thought

512
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:33,004
that Pam was too "meh"
or thin without being toned.

513
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,363
But I wanna
tell you something.

514
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,805
She is one of the plain,
hearty women of Scranton

515
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,740
that make this city great.

516
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,437
And so what if she
doesn't wear makeup?

517
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,706
I wear makeup.

518
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,180
We like her better that way! And
you steal clients, don't you?

519
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,708
Don't you?

520
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,409
Okay, that's different.

521
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,010
"That's different," is it?

522
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,146
Okay, thief.

523
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,249
You better check your things, people.
In fact, where are my keys?

524
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:58,195
Oh. They're in my pocket.
False alarm.

525
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,256
Okay.

526
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,959
So you're gonna
be working here.

527
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:06,926
Uh...

528
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:08,698
I mean... Yeah.

529
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,598
Welcome aboard.

530
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,606
Thank you.

531
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,840
Hey, crazy. Um...

532
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,816
So, that's it?
You're just... You're fine?

533
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:23,216
It's after 5:00, Jim.
I'm not gonna take this home.

534
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:25,880
Pleasure.

535
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,451
Thanks.

536
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,552
This morning, Danny Cordray stole
a sale from me. So what do I do?

537
00:20:30,795 --> 00:20:32,786
I go out and I
steal Danny Cordray.

538
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:36,027
The sale that mattered,
I made. Boom.

539
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,534
Funny thing about it,
we don't even need him.

540
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:39,797
We already have
Packer on the road.

541
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,166
Crap. I forgot about Packer.

542
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:49,910
Star's in her eyes,
tongue full of flies

543
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:52,814
Would you like
to share my pad?

544
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:56,650
Croak, croak, croak,
Bullfrog in love

545
00:20:57,622 --> 00:21:00,216
Croak, croak, croak,
Bullfrog in love

546
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,418
And I gave her the croak

547
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:02,983
That meant I love you

548
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,120
I'll be your croak monsieur

549
00:21:06,197 --> 00:21:08,563
I'll be your croak madame

550
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,794
Your mama might've said
That bullfrogs are dogs

551
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,463
But I'm here to
Tell you that I'm a frog

552
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,564
Come and sit on my log,
You little pollywog

553
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:18,939
I find you
absolutely ribbitting!

554
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,638
Croak, croak, croak,
Bullfrog in love

555
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,307
Croak, croak, croak,
Bullfrog in love

556
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:25,610
Croak
Ribbit

557
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,914
Scoopty splash

558
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,248
Nice.
