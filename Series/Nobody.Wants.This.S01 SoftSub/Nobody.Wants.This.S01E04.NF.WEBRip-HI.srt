[upbeat music playing]

2
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,226
You guys, I cannot
find Rebecca on Instagram,

3
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,395
and I've done every possible combination.

4
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,772
Rebecca Vassar. Rebecca car accident.

5
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:26,609
Oh, car accident. Maybe she's not on there
because maybe she's dead.

6
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,279
- Did she die?
- No. She just broke her wrist.

7
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,615
For attention. And it was
a very high-level move. I respect it.

8
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,160
Okay, you guys,
Rebecca's not on Instagram.

9
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,495
Wait. How do people know
that she goes on vacation?

10
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,206
She doesn't need validation
like the rest of us.

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,044
- How am I supposed to compete with that?
- Mm. You can't. You need way too much.

12
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,045
- You need a lot.
- Don't!

13
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:48,631
That's not helping my anxiety for tonight.
We have our first real date.

14
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,175
Okay, focus.

15
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,053
You gotta lock this guy down. Like, fast.

16
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,556
He is hot. He's employed.
He doesn't have kids. He comes from money.

17
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,392
He's like a fucking unicorn in this town.

18
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,812
And, babe, the clock is ticking
on that face of yours.

19
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,898
How long do you think I have left
on my face?

20
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,776
I'm talking months, not years.
I know. It's bad. I'm sorry.

21
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,179
- Can we talk about the podcast real quick?
- [Joanne] Yes.

22
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,530
You're interviewing
that sex therapist tomorrow,

23
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,574
so you gotta pick up
the vibrator she's selling.

24
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:17,035
- Yes. What's it called? The Plower?
- No, the Excavator.

25
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,705
- No, no, no. It's the Obliterator.
- Oh, I love that thing!

26
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,834
But warning, you do really need
to work your way up to level ten.

27
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,462
- Like, take it slow.
- [Ashley] Little by little.

28
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,798
- [woman clicks tongue]
- Yeah, yeah.

29
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:35,678
Okay, so you should need at least
one of these tonight unless you biff it.

30
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,640
It's so weird how you buy condoms
for all your friends.

31
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,723
We all talk about it.

32
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,768
All right, just take your pick.

33
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:45,730
I want you to feel comfortable,
so take whatever you need. No judgment.

34
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,900
- Everyone's built differently.
- [Sasha] Man, you're so good at this.

35
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,402
You could make a business out of this.
You know, like <i>Hitch.</i>

36
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,571
- Bro, thank you.
- [Sasha] Yeah.

37
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,657
Film was a fucking masterpiece.

38
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,616
So good, right?

39
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,952
You know what the truth is?
I love helping people.

40
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,246
The last thing you need
is to knock up a rebound.

41
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,790
Whoa! Whoa, whoa. She's not a rebound.

42
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,959
Dude, two minutes after a big breakup,

43
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:10,505
some short, sparkly Barbie rolls along,
who's the complete opposite of Rebecca.

44
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,842
- No, you're wrong.
- [Sasha] Come on. Is a rebound so bad?

45
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:17,011
You have a little fun,
and you get your mind off Rebecca.

46
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,805
Fair enough, but Joanne's more than fun.

47
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,349
Dude, you're saying that
like fun's a bad thing.

48
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,226
- No.
- We love fun.

49
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,686
But do we end up with fun?

50
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:28,064
Yeah, have you met Esther?
She's not fun. That's why I married her.

51
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,276
Listen, I have to be honest.
You guys are getting in my head a bit.

52
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,863
I'll tell you something.
Joanne's more than just a rebound, okay?

53
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,533
And I know, sure, on the surface,
she seems very "fun,"

54
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,910
but I really think
there's a lot more to her than that.

55
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,955
You know what I'm gonna do?
Tonight, I'm gonna go deeper.

56
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,707
I'm gonna push really deep with her.

57
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,834
- You're gonna push deeper.
- Deep as hell, man.

58
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,545
- Yeah. Yeah. I'll...
- You might hit her sternum.

59
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,172
[man grunting]

60
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,089
[Sasha] Oh my God.

61
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,425
- This one's got a <i>yarmulke</i> on it.
- All right.

62
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,510
[upbeat music playing]

63
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,476
Hey, how much do I Venmo you
for my half of the Obliterator?

64
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,314
Okay. Well, first of all,
let's do single ownership on this one.

65
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,273
- [Joanne] Okay.
- Right?

66
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,526
Second of all, um, I didn't get it
because I thought you were getting it.

67
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,612
Wait, what? No, can you please get it?

68
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,656
'Cause I have my date with Noah tonight,
and it's, like, consuming me.

69
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,702
Oh my God. It's consuming you?
Joanne, you met this guy 48 hours ago.

70
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,870
Yeah, but...

71
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:28,875
Okay, I know this might sound insane,
but this could be the last time

72
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,502
I ever have sex
with someone for the first time.

73
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,421
Are you okay?

74
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,624
- [phone chimes]
- It's wild.

75
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,216
- [Morgan] Oh God.
- [phone chimes]

76
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,801
Oh my God, Mom. You know what?

77
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:43,014
I'm sorry, but if she is gonna send us
unhinged videos of her doing mushrooms,

78
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,475
then she needs to do mushrooms less
'cause I cannot.

79
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,768
[giggles] I know. She's a lot.

80
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,896
That's why I just delete them. I already
can hear what she's going to say.

81
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,147
You know, she's just like,

82
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,902
"The medicine told me to tell you both
how grateful I am for both of you."

83
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,655
You know? Then it's just, like,
two minutes of insanity.

84
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,738
Right.

85
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,450
- That's where you get it.
- What?

86
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,826
I am so not like Mom.

87
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,744
Yes, you are.

88
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,621
- No, I'm not.
- [Morgan] You are both a lot.

89
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,707
She scares people off.
You scare people off.

90
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,920
Wait. Why has no one ever told me this?

91
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,588
Because they're scared.

92
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,589
[sighs]

93
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:21,302
Listen, okay? You just need to be,
like, casual. All right? Be aloof.

94
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,472
Don't show him how much you like him.
He'll have nothing to chase.

95
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,141
Why drink the milk
when you can buy the cow for free?

96
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,769
Yes, no. That's not the phrase,
but I do hear you.

97
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,313
- Yes, it is.
- Even though now I'm totally spinning.

98
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,757
[Morgan] No, I think that's right.

99
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,526
It's "why drink the milk
when you can buy the cow for free?"

100
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,280
That sounds right. "Why drink the milk
when you can buy the cow for free?"

101
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,199
I think you're wrong.
I think that's right.

102
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,285
[upbeat music playing]

103
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,589
- [Esther] Oh!
- Hey, babe.

104
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,676
- Hi, babe.
- [Sasha] What are you doing?

105
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,139
Oh, I'm just out here
pairing your gargantuan socks.

106
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,432
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

107
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,308
What?

108
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:13,229
Remember when the Red Hot Chili Peppers
would only wear one sock? That was sexy.

109
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,148
Um, what... What is this here?

110
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,735
I just thought that we missed our
regularly scheduled Wednesday sex night,

111
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,113
and with Miriam at a sleepover,
maybe we can make up for lost time.

112
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,700
What do you think? I'm just trying
to grease the wheels a little bit.

113
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,328
I see. And in this scenario,
I'm the wheels.

114
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,704
Yeah, but the hot wheels.

115
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,998
- Shoes off the bed, please? Okay.
- Okay.

116
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:32,999
Absolutely.

117
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,167
There they go.

118
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,794
- Don't need those.
- "Don't need those."

119
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,172
Listen, I wish I... Okay, here he goes.

120
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,674
I wish I could,
but I'm going to the bar with Rebecca.

121
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,093
She needs a wingwoman.
She's gotta get back on the horse.

122
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,553
- You know what?
- [Esther] What?

123
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,513
- Why don't you just cancel plans?
- Oh no.

124
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:51,851
- 'Cause I know you love canceling plans.
- I wish I could, but she really needs me.

125
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,062
So it's gonna be you
all by your lonesome tonight.

126
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,108
So I'm gonna be at the house,
totally alone, all by myself?

127
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:04,364
You can do your Chili Peppers sock trick
all by yourself, you little perv.

128
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,036
Sure these shorts
aren't doing anything for you?

129
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,599
- [Esther] No.
- [Sasha] They're mesh.

130
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,372
Okay.

131
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,377
- [breathes deeply]
- [doorbell chimes]

132
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,879
[Joanne] Hi.

133
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,258
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

134
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:30,139
- You also look really nice.
- I appreciate it. First date. You nervous?

135
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,766
Oh, nah. No. You?

136
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,226
Good. No. Look at that.

137
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,938
And you're picking me up at my front door.
Chivalry's alive and well.

138
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,482
I'm not gonna let you walk
to the car alone. That's crazy.

139
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,109
- [phone rings]
- Sorry.

140
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,820
[Joanne exhales]

141
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,780
- [phone rings]
- Oh my God. Sorry.

142
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,990
- Hold on. It's my sister.
- Sure.

143
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,452
Hey, girl. What's up?
I'm with Noah. Everything okay?

144
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,329
[Morgan] <i>Yeah, are you being a psycho yet?</i>

145
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,956
[laughs awkwardly] You're so funny.

146
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,000
[Morgan] <i>Okay, so I went to three places,
and they were all sold out, so...</i>

147
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:02,547
Okay. Can you, um, find another place,
then? Can you please figure this out?

148
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,925
[Morgan] <i>No. No. I gave up, um,
and I have plans, so you're it. Bye.</i>

149
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,677
- I can't...
- [phone beeps]

150
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,345
- Fuck.
- Everything okay?

151
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,389
- Yeah.
- You sure?

152
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:15,476
Yeah. We have this exciting sex therapist
on the podcast tomorrow.

153
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,104
It was a big get for us,
and it is vital that we are prepared.

154
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:21,357
My stupid sister was supposed to pick up
her product, which is called the...

155
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,277
Doesn't matter what it's called.
Uh, but she didn't get it.

156
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,696
And that's fine.

157
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,947
That's fine.

158
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,033
We have some time before dinner.
Why don't <i>we</i> go get it?

159
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:35,163
[hesitates] No, we don't need to.
It's chill. I'm chill.

160
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,874
Are you sure?
You said it's important. It's for work.

- [Noah] Yeah. Yeah.
- [woman sighs]

324
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,521
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

325
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,107
You know, I've, uh...
I've never been here before.

326
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,817
I've never been here before either.

327
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,695
[Joanne] Comin' in hot!
That's gonna leave a mark!

328
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,863
Oh my God.

329
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:10,534
[groans] This is
Mr. and Mrs. Goldberg. Joanne.

330
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,702
- [Joanne] Hi.
- This is...

331
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,246
Hi. Uh, nice to meet you.

332
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,167
Mr. Goldberg is actually
a... a board member of our temple.

333
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,252
<i>Shalom.</i>

334
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,211
[Noah groaning]

335
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,840
I'm... I'm really, really sorry.
I never should have brought you here.

336
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,841
It's bad.

337
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,469
- I'm really sorry.
- He's gonna tell my boss. I'm screwed.

338
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,722
But... I mean, is it that bad?

339
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,433
Like, he was in there with his wife too.

340
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,853
Yes, but he's not a rabbi.
I have to change temples now.

341
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,065
Actually, I have to switch careers.
I'll just go work for my dad.

342
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,817
That's what I'm gonna do.
Wow. Wow! Life changes so fast.

343
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,236
Noah. No, I refuse to accept that.

344
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,697
You can just talk to him,
like, man-to-man.

345
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,616
- Blame it on me.
- I don't have his number.

346
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,867
I don't know what to say.

347
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,287
Well, the Internet's a powerful tool.
I can find you his number.

348
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,081
We can figure out what to say.

349
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:01,418
Mr. Goldberg. Board member. Temple.

350
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,503
How do you spell <i>Chai?</i>

351
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,213
- [Noah] C-H-A-I.
- C-H-A-I.

352
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,508
- Boom! Is that him?
- Yeah.

353
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,843
Yeah, that's what I thought. Okay. Well...

354
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,303
Oh.

355
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,723
- What?
- Rabbi Roklov.

356
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,894
Does that look like the woman
who he was in the sex shop with?

357
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,479
No, it doesn't.

358
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,939
That wasn't his wife.

359
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,441
Mr. Goldberg?

360
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,404
You bad, bad boy!

361
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,948
I hate to say it. I hate to say it.

362
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,034
- But this could be good for me.
- Okay, just hold on.

363
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,744
Let's fact-check it and make su...

364
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,662
Well, no.

365
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,288
If you were thinking like I was,

366
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,708
maybe he and his wife are separated.
They're not.

367
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,253
This photo was posted four days ago
for his wedding anniversary.

368
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,336
That's his wife.

369
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,841
- Oh, that's really sad.
- Yes! Yes! Yeah, for sure.

370
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,509
Sad, but also...

371
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,428
[Joanne laughs]

372
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,511
...so good.

373
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,099
- [Joanne] So you're okay!
- [Noah] I feel a lot better.

374
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,476
- I feel very hungry.
- Really? Oh yeah. Okay. Sure.

375
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,147
Let's get you something to eat.
Um, I think we missed the reservation.

376
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,232
- That's the thing. Where do you wanna go?
- Uh...

377
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,984
- A lot of places.
- Where are we?

378
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,654
Oh! Search taco places near us
'cause I heard about a cute spot.

379
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,744
You know what? Actually, um, it's closed.

380
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,411
- Is it?
- Yep.

381
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,125
Okay, listen. I know a good spot.

382
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,917
Still open.

383
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,879
- Really?
- [Noah] Yep.

384
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,964
[upbeat music playing]

385
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,549
Come with me.

386
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,011
[Joanne laughs] Okay.

387
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,765
[Noah] Your Obliterator.

388
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,645
[music fades]

389
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:49,026
Do you want ice cream? It's really cold,
like ice cream... is supposed to be.

390
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,109
I'm okay.

391
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:52,945
Are you worried?

392
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,990
No, not at all.

393
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,285
Okay. The way you said that makes me think
you're worried, but I'm not worried.

394
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,707
- [cell phone trills]
- Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God.

395
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,374
Okay, it's him.

396
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,545
"Hey, that's cool."

397
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,216
"But, actually,
I like a different Miriam."

398
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,051
Oh my God. He likes you.

399
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,011
Oh my God. He likes me.

400
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,432
He likes me. He likes me! He likes me!

401
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,017
[laughing] Hey!

402
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,064
Do you wanna hang out with me?
Cuddle up and watch <i>Mission: Impossible?</i>

403
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,192
I gotta go back to Angelica's.
This is absolutely gonna destroy her.

404
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,777
Yeah, it will. Get back there.

405
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:38,659
Oh, uh, Dad? Thanks. Sorry for saying
that you never help me with anything.

406
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,743
You never said that.

407
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,789
Bye, honey. Love you.

408
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,415
Love you too, Dad.

409
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,251
- [Miriam] Love you too, Dad.
- Thank you.

410
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,044
- [door closes]
- [cell phone trills]

411
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:56,760
"Hey, so I'm not into it,
but my friend Trevor is."

412
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,844
Okay.

413
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,721
What's Trevor's deal?

414
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,557
Is he cool?

415
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,560
Does he play <i>Fortnite?</i>

416
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,603
[Noah] Good stuff here.

417
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,106
[gentle music playing]

418
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,110
[Joanne sighs]

419
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,331
I feel really bad
you had to do all this work

420
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,325
and that we didn't even get to go
to that restaurant that you loved.

421
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,452
I've actually never been
to that restaurant.

422
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,956
I chose it 'cause it looked cool online
and I wanted to impress you.

423
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,543
Okay. Well, this is impressive.

424
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,711
- Really?
- Yes.

425
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:31,962
Wait till you taste it.

426
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,882
Well, I'm really hungry,
so I'm sure it's gonna be great.

427
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,597
Oh my God. You just whipped that up?

428
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,433
- It's pretty simple.
- It's unbelievable.

429
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,060
- Okay, all right. [chuckles]
- [Joanne] Very impressive.

430
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,062
- You don't have to lie.
- I'm not lying.

431
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,897
Mmm.

432
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,320
Can we talk about tonight?

433
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,490
It felt like something was weird, and, um,

434
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,869
I was just trying to connect, you know?

435
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,038
Yeah, I felt that.

436
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:10,250
When you asked me my biggest fear
in the sex shop, that felt weird.

437
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,294
- That was awkwardly timed.
- Mm-hmm.

438
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,504
Um, okay.

439
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,174
I'm gonna lay it all out there.

440
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,551
I don't want this to be a rebound.

441
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,347
I want it to be something real.
And maybe that's lame to say,

442
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,349
uh, but I guess I'm okay with that.

443
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,811
I'm not just looking for something fun.
And if you are, that's totally cool.

444
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,106
You don't owe me anything.
I would just like to know.

445
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,443
Yeah, no, um...

446
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,489
[chuckles nervously] Here's the truth.

447
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,621
Actually, I've never done this before,
and it's feeling very scary.

448
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,665
Can you... Would you mind turning around?

449
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,959
- What? You want...
- Fine, I'll do it.

450
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,378
- Okay.
- Okay. [sighs]

451
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:01,677
Noah, my mom is really emotional,
and it always pushed my dad away.

452
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,055
I'm not saying that's what made him gay,
but it certainly didn't keep him straight.

453
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,350
And I always tried really hard
not to be like that.

454
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:13,355
And, yes, sometimes I do weird shit,
and I can be impulsive and obsessive,

455
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:17,484
and I did Google your ex-girlfriend,
and I'm really sorry you had to see that.

456
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,610
I didn't see that.

457
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,654
Oh.

458
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,865
Well, I only did it that once.

459
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:29,454
And... my biggest fear <i>is</i> a bad facelift,

460
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,538
but I...

461
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,711
I think I'm realizing an even bigger fear.

462
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,838
It is...

463
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:41,924
this.

464
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,931
That I will become emotionally dependent

465
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:52,477
on a guy who will one day realize
that I'm too much and break my heart.

466
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,563
[gentle music playing]

467
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,866
Is that the most unattractive thing
you've ever seen?

468
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,827
No. It's the most attractive.

469
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,663
I want this.

470
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,207
I want all of this.

471
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,378
But are you gonna do that, Noah?

472
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,048
Are you gonna break my heart?

473
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,134
It would truly kill me
to break your heart.

00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,017
- I really have.
- [both laugh]

493
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,975
Think I'm gonna be able
to use this to my advantage?

494
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,355
I really do.

495
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,438
All right.

496
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,149
- Okay.
- Right this way.

497
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,610
Oh. I have to let you know
before anything happens.

498
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:24,528
Yeah.

499
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,781
I think I'm in a relationship
with a teenage boy I met on the Internet.

500
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,533
Oh. Does he know about me?

501
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,702
Yeah. He was okay with it
because we aren't that serious yet.

502
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,747
Okay. You guys
are still seeing other people?

503
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,792
[Sasha] Yeah, he invited me
to his eighth-grade graduation.

504
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,877
[gentle music continues]

505
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,924
Would you hand me my phone?

506
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,719
Thank you.

507
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,641
[Joanne clears throat]

508
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:57,727
Hello, sister.

509
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,147
The medicine wants me to share with you

510
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,901
that I just had incredible sex
with the rabbi

511
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,113
<i>after</i> I showed him all of my crazy.

512
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,698
And guess what?

513
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,783
It didn't scare him.

514
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,596
- I'm actually really into it.

I was hoping to catch you.

522
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,773
I had an interesting phone call
with Mr. Goldberg.

523

I can explain.
