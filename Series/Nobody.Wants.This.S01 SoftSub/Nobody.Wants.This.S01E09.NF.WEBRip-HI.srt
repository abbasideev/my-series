00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,675
[upbeat music playing]

2
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,231
What made you wanna be a rabbi,
like, in the first place?

3
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,484
The goal was to be in the NBA,
but, you know, that's all political.

4
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,610
[Joanne laughs]

5
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:29,821
Come on, I'm serious.

6
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,866
You know... [chuckles]

7
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,326
It's funny. I get a little self-conscious
telling you this.

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,287
When I was little,
I was a pretty nervous kid.

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,414
Bit of a scaredy-cat, if you will.

10
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:43,793
And the world seemed like a very chaotic
and... and unsafe place to me.

11
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,213
And when I started paying attention
to the lessons in the Torah

12
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,633
and, uh, was exposed to the rituals
and the traditions,

13
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:55,472
it allowed me to view the world
as a much safer and more meaningful place.

14
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,307
And I knew from a very young age

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,601
I wanted to spend my life
trying to help keep it alive.

16
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,436
That's a great answer.

17
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,773
It was either that
or all my mom's influence.

18
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,566
Anyways, excited to meet her?

19
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,568
I'm excited to meet both your parents.

20
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,571
Good. They're really important to me.
I want it to go well.

21
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,490
Now you're making me nervous.

22
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,866
Don't be nervous.

23
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,952
Is it true what they say
about Jewish boys and their moms?

24
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,537
I mean, we're pretty close.

25
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,581
You don't still
kiss your mom on the lips, do you?

26
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,126
No. I mean, that's gross.

27
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,003
[upbeat music playing]

28
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,887
I <i>was</i> fine. Not nervous at all.

29
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,139
And then Noah freaked me out.

30
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,101
That's trash. That is trash.
These are trash.

31
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,977
- Mm. Trash.
- Yep.

32
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,395
- Trash.
- Okay.

33
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,565
Tra... No, Mom. This is a jury summons.
You have to respond to this.

34
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,318
Oh, I can't.
I always side with the accused.

35
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,861
And don't worry, sweetheart.

36
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,739
You know,
I loved meeting your father's parents.

37
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,366
It was easy-peasy.

38
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,159
Because they were both dead already.

39
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,871
Well, that's lucky.
I just... I don't wanna screw it up.

40
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,248
I like Noah so much,

41
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,417
and it's a really important step
to meet his parents.

42
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:10,213
And I don't know if we can be together
if they don't approve.

43
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,925
Did you know he asked me
if I'd consider converting?

44
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,678
To Judaism?

45
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,390
For my religion.

46
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,893
Oh, that's fun. Is it? I don't know.

47
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,313
I don't know either. I don't even know
if I believe in organized religion.

48
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,648
Oh, preach.

49
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,941
[sighs]

50
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,444
Once again, you haven't given me
any advice I can use, so I'm gonna go.

51
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,328
- Well, no, no. Oh, no.
- [Joanne] I love you.

52
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,031
- Bye.
- No, you can't go. You can't go.

53
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,033
Why not? She's got a life to live.

54
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,328
Oh, no! Come on. Hey! No, stay.
Let's talk some more about religion.

55
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,706
- Help me. I asked you to stay focused.
- Remember...

56
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,126
Is that her fucking car parked outside?
You guys are unreal, okay?

57
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,170
- Like, seriously?
- I had to.

58
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,005
I feel awful when you two fight.

59
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,841
I mean, I can feel
my uterus ripping in two.

60
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,342
- What?
- Morgan is dead to me.

61
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,260
Oh, okay.

62
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,263
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to record the podcast with her,

63
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,266
knowing that our listeners
won't be able to trust

64
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,142
a word that comes out of her mouth.

65
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,905
What makes you think
I wanna do the podcast

66
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,104
when every story you tell
puts our audience to sleep?

67
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,025
Okay? It's like, nobody cares which
aluminum-free deodorant you like the most.

68
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,961
- I'm sorry, was that a diss...
- [Morgan] Yeah.

69
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,362
...or just another lie?
I can never tell with you.

70
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,281
You know that I'm not a liar, right?

71
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,617
- Oh, of course, honey.
- Thank you.

72
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,702
But you have always been
a bit of a storyteller.

73
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,954
[chuckles] Remember back in fifth grade

74
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,165
when you told everyone
that I was in Wham!?

75
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,042
- I do.
- Oh, I loved that one.

76
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,752
I am just trying to help you,

77
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:34,505
but you refuse to accept the fact
that Noah lied to you, okay?

78
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,300
- The truth is going to come out.
- Get your finger out of my face.

79
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,427
I'll put it wherever I want.
Deal with that.

80
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,848
Okay, I can't stay here anymore.
I have a date tonight anyway

81
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,809
with one of the guys that I met
on the "desperate dating" apps.

82
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,271
And he happens to be
a hot, professional baseball player

83
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,481
for the Pittsburgh

84
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,815
team.

85
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:59,072
I dated a baseball player once.
Most erotic time of my life.

86
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,240
Wow, thanks a lot.

87
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,575
[Joanne] I honestly cannot believe
you did that.

88
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:08,665
[phone ringing]

89
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,582
[phone chimes]

90
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,792
Hey, what's up?

91
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,795
[Morgan] <i>Hey, I need to...
Why are you hiding in the bathroom?</i>

92
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,839
<i>Oh, I get it. You don't want
your wife to hear us talking.</i>

93
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,008
What? No. All right, yeah.

94
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,678
<i>So I just haven't told Esther
that we're friends yet.</i>

95
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,845
Why are you calling me?

96
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,723
<i>Okay, so, um, what's the deal
with Noah and Rebecca?</i>

97
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,725
<i>- Are they talking again?</i>
- What do you mean?

98
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,186
If I tell you something,
I need you to swear

99
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,146
you're never gonna repeat it to anyone.

100
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,774
- Not Noah, not Esther, like, nobody.
- [Sasha] <i>100%.</i>

101
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,528
I just need to let you know I've never
successfully kept a secret before.

102
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,321
Keep that in mind before you tell me.

103
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,783
Okay. Okay.
Well, so I ran into Rebecca last week.

104
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,285
Oh, okay, that is juicy.

105
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,662
Yes. I talked to her.
Well, Julie talked to her.

106
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,663
Okay, who's Julie?

107
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,748
[Morgan] <i>I'm Julie,
but Rebecca didn't know that.</i>

108
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,227
She basically told me
her and Noah are getting back together.

109
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,212
What? No way. No. Noah would have told me.

110
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,589
He tells me everything.
I'm like <i>his</i> rabbi.

111
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,757
[sighs]

112
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,468
Although, what if
he's hiding that from me?

113
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,680
God, that's a hard pill.

114
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,807
I don't know, but get to the bottom of it.

115
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,809
- Let me know what you find out.
- [car beeps]

116
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,144
And don't mention my name.

117
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,896
Okay. All right.
I will, but you can't mention my name.

118
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,690
<i>Sorry, why would I mention your name?</i>

119
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:19,110
I don't know. You said it,
and it felt like I should say it back.

120
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,279
Okay, bye. Thanks, weirdo.

121
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,362
Bye, talk later.

122
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,405
[phone chimes]

123
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,616
[toilet flushes]

124
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,160
[buoyant music playing]

125
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,954
What's that?

126
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,458
A gift I thought you could give my mom.

127
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,709
- Noah. No.
- Well?

128
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,045
- Wanna tell me what's in the box?
- Absolutely not.

129
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,340
Please let me do my thing, okay?
I'm an excellent gift-giver.

130
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,257
- Okay.
- Trust.

131
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,469
[doorbell chimes]

132
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:48,056
You ring the doorbell at your own house?
You don't just walk right in?

133
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,059
Without announcing ourselves? Are you...

134
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,352
- What's...
- Sorry.

135
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,230
Okay, deep breath. I got ya.

136
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,650
Ah! Welcome.

137
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,818
- Hey, hi.
- Hi. Hi.

138
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:01,736
- Hello.
- [Noah] Hey.

139
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,154
[Noah's mom] Here's my baby.

140
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,448
- Oh, hello. Hi.
- Here's my baby.

141
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,283
[both] Mwah!

142
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,201
[Noah] Hi.

143
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,411
- You feel too thin.
- Good? No, swole.

144
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,581
And you must be the famous Joanne.

145
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:17,752
Ah, guilty. I'm happy to sign an autograph
if you'd like, Mr. Roklov.

146
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,938
- [chuckles] Please, call me Ilan.
- [Joanne] Thank you.

147
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:23,216
Mom, this is Joanne.
Joanne, this is my mother, Bina.

148
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,842
It's a pleasure to meet you, Bina.

149
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,845
Please, call me Mrs. Roklov.

150
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,391
- Okay. Um, I brought you a gift.
- Yeah.

151
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,935
Oh, thank you. How nice. Heavy.

152
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,603
- [Noah] It is.
- Is it food?

153
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,686
- It is.
- Come on in.

154
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,107
- Should we take it to the kitchen?
- I love to eat.

155
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,775
- Yeah.
- We all love to eat.

156
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,861
Well, I hope you like it.
I... I was very excited about it.

157
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,824
It's, um, spoiler alert,
a custom-made <i>charcuterie</i> board

158
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,992
that I had designed for this occasion.

159
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,869
[Bina] It'll be perfect for lunch.

160
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,915
Oh. Oh! Uh... [clears throat] Is this pork?

161
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,085
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. That's prosciutto.

162
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,087
- Uh-huh.
- Prosciutto is pork.

163
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,839
What?

164
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,922
Come on.

165
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,467
I thought prosciutto
was fancy Italian beef.

166
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,594
- [Ilan] I wish.
- Vera, dear.

167
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,639
Uh, please throw this in the trash.

168
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,307
Oh, hold on, Vera.

169
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:17,311
Uh, is it possible that we could maybe
just eat, like, around the pork?

170
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,021
- The berries are so fresh.
- Mm-hmm.

171
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:24,152
Thank you, my dear. But you see,
it's already been all tainted by the pork.

172
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,572
Uh, Joanne also brought you this.

173
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,198
- What?
- [Noah] Yeah.

174
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,282
[Bina laughs]

175
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,785
Now, this is a beautiful gift. Thank you.

176
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,287
- [Sasha] Hi!
- You're welcome.

177
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,832
Sasha, Esther,
look what I got from your brother.

178
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,792
I'm pretty sure prosciutto is beef.

179
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,503
No, it's definitely pork,
but it's beautiful.

180
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,714
Kids, thank you.
That's just so thoughtful.

181
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,967
- [Noah] Hey!
- [Esther] Hey, buddy.

182
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,927
- Where's Miriam?
- At <i>bat mitzvah</i> tutor.

183
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,138
Our little girl's big day is coming up.

184
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,182
- Yeah.
- Can you believe?

185
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:58,019
I've never been to a <i>bat mitzvah</i> before.
It sounds so fun.

186
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,648
It's gonna be a very important day.

187
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,444
Yep, it will. You know, they get boring.
You wouldn't wanna come.

188
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,697
- I think the <i>hora</i> gets pretty lit.
- It's a beautiful <i>simcha.</i>

189
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,950
Yeah, but they're mostly...
Thank you both. It's mostly boring.

190
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,161
Mom, I'm gonna give Joanne a tour.

191
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,370
I'd love that.

192
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,207
Sasha, dear. I would like you
to mix us some drinks

193
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,585
while I put away
this lovely gift that my son gave me.

194
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,004
Uh, yes.
How about a very large glass of wine?

195
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,087
Red would be great.

196
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,842
No. We do not serve red in this house
because there have been incidents.

197
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,929
- It was Esther both times.
- Okay. Thanks, everyone.

198
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,639
White is just fine, then.

199
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,725
Esther, sweetie, would you please
cut up some of the cucumbers?

200
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,520
- You talking to me?
- Uh-huh.

201
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,581
- In your kitchen?
- [Bina] Mm-hmm.

202
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,317
- And you're not being sarcastic?
- No, sweetie. I trust you.

203
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,568
You know what you're doing.

204
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,905
[gentle music playing]

205
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,031
Well, all right.

206
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,075
Yeah. Don't fuck it up.

207
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:58,538
No, I won't. It's just cucumbers.
How could it be ha... hard?

208
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,291
[Noah] And now for the best part
of the tour, my old bedroom.

209
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,711
- Oh wow!
- Right?

210
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,465
- Wow, wow, wow!
- Right? Yeah. As you can see, I was cool.

211
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,010
- Um, this is a canopy bed.
- Yep.

212
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,429
This was the bed you wanted
when you were 17?

213
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:20,017
No, but, uh, my mom picked it out.
And when she bought it, then it was here.

214
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,311
- Ah.
- Yeah.

215
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,814
You never told her
it wasn't what you wanted?

216
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,858
Uh... I didn't wanna hurt her feelings.

217
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,279
I love that you protect your mom,
but it's okay to push back sometimes.

218
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,364
You could've been sleeping
in a race car bed.

219
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,324
I would've killed for a race car bed.

220
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,826
[Noah groans softly]

221
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:41,956
So when you brought girls up here,
you just hooked up under this canopy?

222
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,916
Oh yeah. They loved it.

223
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,126
We'd hook up there.

224
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,628
We'd hook up above it,
below it, beside it.

225
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,089
- No, there's never been a girl in here.
- There's ne...

226
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,258
- I'm your first?
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,177
- Welcome to the canopy.
- [Joanne] Wow!

228
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,596
It's all part of my plan.

229
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,978
Brunch is ready.

230
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,938
[quirky music playing]

231
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,773
And that bed is meant for one.

232
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,736
- That's why no girls.
- Sorry.

233
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,071
Can't believe I'm finally
the good daughter-in-law

234
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,617
now that Joanne's around.
The power's kind of, like, intoxicating.

235
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,454
Do you think Joanne's gonna stick around?
Rebecca and Noah are completely done?

236
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,456
Why would you even ask that?

237
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,499
I don't know. It's just something I heard.

238
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,143
From where? What do you mean you heard?

239
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,961
Nothing. I mean, I didn't hear it

240
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,797
like in, you know,
like a real sense of hearing.

241
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,301
It... It's just that, like, I heard it
in the sense that it was like

242
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,511
a psychic vision
or a premonition or something.

243
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,263
You know how that happens sometimes?

244
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,891
Babe, do you know
what's actually really funny?

245
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,227
Okay. Rebecca saw the dumb sister.

246
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,021
Pretended not to know who she was.

247
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:51,817
And told her just, like, a bunch of lies
about her and Noah just to fuck with her.

248
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,361
It's amazing.

249
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,114
My God. Women are scary.

250
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,409
Hey, hey. You need to promise me
you are not gonna repeat that.

251
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,162
Yeah. No. No, no, no. Of course not.

252
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,330
That's just like...

253
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,750
That's just really juicy information
that people would kill for,

254
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,628
and I'm just not gonna
do anything with it or tell anybody.

255
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,712
Okay. Great.

256
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,798
[suspenseful music playing]

257
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,424
[Bina] <i>So here we are.</i>

258
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:17,927
Yep.

259
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,010
It's okay.

260
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,054
[music fades]

261
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,347
Wow!

262
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,849
Everything looks incredible.

263
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,309
- Doesn't it?
- Thank you.

264
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,978
- [Joanne] Yeah.
- You gotta try my mom's famous <i>pâté.</i>

265
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,897
- Oh.
- She makes it from scratch.

266
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,692
- Oh, okay.
- Try a little sample of that.

267
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,777
It's chopped liver.

268
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,988
- Mmm.
- Right?

269
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:38,906
Wow!

270
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,366
I can smell it from here.

271
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,994
That is so good.

272
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,455
So tell me,

273
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,917
Joanne, what exactly is your religion?

274
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,920
Well,

275
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:59,093
I guess, um, religion was never
really anything I grew up with.

276
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,637
We celebrated Christmas,
but that was the only holiday

277
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,764
I can ever remember
my parents getting into.

278
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,308
And your parents
are divorced now, isn't that right?

279
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,270
No, they're separated.

280
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,107
Uh, but it's probably permanent
since my dad is gay.

281
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,859
Ah.

282
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,446
- Esther, could you pass the fruit, please?
- With pleasure.

283
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:23,409
Mm. And this is
what your, uh, your podcast is about?

284
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,370
My gay dad? No.
Sadly, I think that one's been done.

285
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,580
- Ah.
- Um...

286
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,918
It is about sex and relationships
in the modern world.

287
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,087
And this is how you make money?

288
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,589
Talking about what you do

289
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,842
behind closed doors with sex and men
in front of the whole world?

290
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,304
I mean, people actually pay to hear this?

291
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,806
Yeah. That's how I make money.

292
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,974
Uh-huh.

293
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,684
How do you make money?

294
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,227
Oh mama!

295
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,938
- Mmm. Mm-mmm.
- [sighs]

296
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,357
Who seasoned these cucumbers? Fabulous.

297
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,946
Well, I was... busy raising children,

298
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,116
which I know is not as important

299
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,745
as talking about all my former lovers
for public consumption.

300
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:11,457
Honestly, it's embarrassing.
No woman should act this way. Airing...

301
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,042
Mom, enough.

302
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,059
You'll excuse me.

303
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,861
Oh my God!

304
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,405
I am gonna remember this moment
for the rest of my life.

305
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,075
I would like to officially invite you
to Miriam's <i>bat mitzvah.</i>

306
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,578
Being around you
makes me look like a goddamn angel.

307
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,122
Well, I'm gonna go talk to your mother.

308
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,541
- I will.
- Whoa.

309
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,668
This is between her and me.

310
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,753
Actually, I wasn't really
gonna talk to her.

311
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,505
I'm gonna take a little nap.

312
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,588
It's okay.

313
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,967
[tense music playing]

314
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,221
[gasps]

315
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,184
How dare you
come into my kitchen unannounced?

316
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,521
How is that prosciutto?

317
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,566
Is it good?

318
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,568
- No one will believe you.
- [Joanne] Mm.

319
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,654
Food's getting cold, so...

320
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,741
Think I'm gonna head back in.

321
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,661
Joanne.

322
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,371
Joanne.

323
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:34,957
Joanne.

324
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,626
You're not gonna believe
what I walked in on.

325
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,628
Don't listen to a word she says.

326
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:44,008
She was trying to clean the kitchen
while we were still eating.

327
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,593
Can you believe that?

328
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,553
My girl, Bina.

329
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,431
Don't worry. She gave me permission
to call her that.

330
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,434
And, Bina,
you have such an amazing family.

331
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,519
Which I expected,
seeing how you raised Noah

332
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,479
to be the extraordinary man he is.

333
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,647
Let me get your chair.

334
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,942
Just want you to be comfortable.

335
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,651
[exhales happily]

336
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,821
Mmm, this is delicious.

337
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,576
[whispers] What is happening?

338
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,494
I have no idea.

339
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,872
[tranquil music playing]

340
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,835
- Should I check on Dad?
- Don't bother, sweetheart.

341
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,836
He wakes up at 6:00.

342
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,631
We'll eat another meal,
and then he'll fall asleep.

343
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,717
Somebody ate all the prosciutto
off the <i>charcuterie</i> board.

344
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:28,969
What?

345
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,932
Oh yeah. That was me.

346
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,518
Um, I'm sorry,
I couldn't help myself. [chuckles]

347
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,687
I hope you can forgive me.

348
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,606
But it was in the trash.

349
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,943
Yeah. Yes.

350
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:48,322
And I... I fished it out of the garbage,
and I ate it.

351
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,159
Like a raccoon.

352
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:58,082
Joanne, you're so remarkable.
How is it that you are not married?

353
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:02,586
Um, if I'm being real, probably... [exhales]

354
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,172
...I'm a hopeless romantic.

355
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,926
I just haven't found
the right mother-in-law yet.

356
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,011
[chuckles]

357
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,931
Mom, are you all right?
You having a stroke?

358
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,642
No, I'm laughing because Joanne is funny.

359
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,686
[Bina laughs]

360
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,396
Is this the tone of your podcast?

361
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,649
Like, if I were a guest,
what would you do?

362
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:27,277
My sister and I would start
by putting you at ease.

363
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,989
Um, like, Esther,
pretend you're my sister.

364
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,032
Oh! Yeah. Sure, I'll be whore number two.

365
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,243
- Esther, language.
- No, it's an inside joke.

366
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,328
- Would you stop it?
- Never mind.

367
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,957
So, first, my sister and I,
we talk a little bit about ourselves.

368
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,918
And then we ask the guest
to tell their stories.

369
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,086
I have a story.

370
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,423
Oh yeah. Mom's a storyteller.
And there's always a lesson.

371
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,716
[Bina] Thank you, dear.

372
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,010
When I was a young woman,

373
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,012
I went to New York City
for the first time.

374
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,515
I was with my grandmother.
The weather was awful.

375
00:16:56,598 --> 00:17:00,144
And so, of course, what happens?
She catches a terrible cold.

376
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,813
So I had to get vapor rub for her chest.

377
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:07,067
I went to the first pharmacy I saw
at 51st and 6th, but they had nothing.

378
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,279
So I go back to the hotel,
and Grandmother was asleep.

379
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,572
So, with nothing to do,

380
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,867
I go down to the lobby,
and there is a bar.

381
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,872
Anyway, Frank Sinatra got me drunk.
And then he stuck his thumb in my mouth.

382
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,542
- Oh. Wait, what?
- Oh!

383
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,253
What was the lesson?

384
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,630
Keep your mouth shut around Frank.

385
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,510
Well, you being the bad one
was short-lived.

386
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,095
Sorry, I'm so likable.

387
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,390
Hey, um, any chance
I can rescind that <i>bat mitzvah</i> invite?

388
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,601
Having you there
isn't benefiting me anymore.

389
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,436
Oh, no. I'll be there.

390
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,355
Well, I tried.
Honey, don't forget the <i>rugelach!</i>

391
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,315
[Sasha] I got it!

392
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,942
- [Esther] Bye, guys.
- Bye. I haven't eaten in 20 minutes.

393
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,171
Text your sister,
see if she'll come to dinner with us.

394
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,489
- No.
- Come on. I hate that you're in a fight.

395
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,410
- What are you fighting about?
- Nothing.

396
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,787
She's just a lying bitch

397
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,664
who's trying to get
in between me and my <i>bubala.</i>

398
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,794
- How do you know Morgan's lying?
- [sighs]

399
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,046
If you knew the situation,
you would get it.

400
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,506
Okay, well, I don't.

401
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,550
Okay, bye. Bye, Mama.

402
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,968
- See ya.
- Bye, Sash.

403
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,721
- Thank you for a lovely day.
- [door closes]

404
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,181
Sorry I raised my voice.

405
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,266
- That was wrong.
- It's okay.

406
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,647
Joanne, it is so nice to know you.

407
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,856
Right back at you.

408
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,734
And you have
to give me the recipe for that pâté

409
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,195
because I can still taste it.

410
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,905
It's just chopped chicken liver.

411
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:35,823
Mmm.

412
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,658
- [Bina] Bye, my son.
- [Noah] Bye.

413
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,992
To be honest...

414
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,327
[door opens]

415
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,455
...I like you so much more
than I thought I would.

416
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,040
Oh, that's sweet.

417
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,001
[whispers] But you're never gonna
end up with my son.
