- [Joanne] I know.
- Have to do the first segment.

I'd love to apologize, Morgan,
but I can't.

13
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:51,468
I just had the single greatest kiss
of my entire existence.

14
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,513
Okay, great. Save it for the show because
I have nothing to talk about this week.

15
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:59,768
I've had a UTI for the last three days,
and I didn't even get it the fun way.

16
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,728
- Here's your cranberry juice.
- Thank you.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,065
I used to get them all the time
with your father.

00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,357
- Mom.
- Gross.

19
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,526
- Morgan, you're gonna die.
- Okay.

20
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,071
Noah and I were playing
this fun cat-and-mouse game,

00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,655
pretending let's just be friends.

that is never gonna happen.

Okay, go on.

24
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,828
I did this cute thing at the restaurant

25
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,664
where I was like,
"I don't think I can stay."

26
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:23,875
Let me guess. You stayed.

27
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,668
- Oh, I stayed.
- Yeah.

28
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,130
And then we walked down the street
and ate ice cream.

29
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:35,178
You know when you see annoying couples
eating ice cream, and you wanna kill them?

We were that couple!

Okay, keep going.

32
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,476
Then he said, "Put down your ice cream."

33
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,312
- I don't hate that.
- Me neither 'cause he was taking charge.

34
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,397
Okay. And did you do what you were told?

35
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,982
I mean, obviously.

36
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,400
- Yes, chef.
- Mm-hmm.

37
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,695
And then you know what happens next.

38
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,531
You went back and fucked in the bathroom.

39
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,242
No, we just kissed.
I said that on the way in.

40
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,911
Maybe that's why you have
all those UTIs. My God.

- Okay, it is Dr. Jay Shah.

- My idea.
- [Joanne] That makes me nervous.

45

He wrote a book about how your aura
indicates what kind of person you are.

Oh, that sounds... stupid.

47

Oh, he's not stupid. He has a degree
from the University of Turks and Caicos.

- [Morgan] Okay.
- You need to be fact-checking that.

I got, like, ten calls
from Rebecca's phone.

It was her mom saying
she's almost in a coma.

and she, like, broke her wrist.

to put a pin in there.

able to take a couple of day off of work.

Should I drive into the back of a bus?

little bit of fun news for you.

- What?

Actually, had my older brother Sidney
not died from typhoid,

00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,706
Noah, tell me you've come to your senses.

170
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,251
Of course you have. You know
I told you that this is just a phase.

171
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:44,297
All we want to hear is
that your heart is open to a reunion. Huh?

172
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:48,509
Tonight, let's focus our energy
on Rebecca getting better.

173
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,553
- Give thanks for that.
- Amen.

174
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,346
Bullshit. He's changing the subject.

175
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,433
You're old enough to be grandparents.
What the hell are you waiting for?

176
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,602
Oh, he's not waiting.
He got himself a <i>shiksa.</i>

177
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,020
Damn it, Esther.

178
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,481
- You're cheating on my daughter?
- No, nobody's cheating.

179
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,524
- Did you know?
- A <i>shiksa?</i> Absolutely not.

180
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,984
- I'm shocked.
- I gotta go.

181
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,529
[Yulia] No, you're not. You knew. You had
to know. You just didn't want me to know.

182
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,990
- Honey. Honey.
- [all clamoring]

183
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,302
- [Yulia] I'd never speak to you again.
- Honey, don't...

184
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,578
I would have been great
in medical school too.

185
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,121
What?

186
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,291
I would've done great in medical school.
I didn't fill out the forms, but...

187
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:26,464
I'm just having trouble computing
how you go from a kiss that passionate

188
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:30,760
and then you just don't respond
for over three hours.

189
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,678
Maybe his side of the kiss

190
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:37,225
was not the same mouth experience
as your side of the kiss.

191
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,268
- Trust me. That's not the case.
- [Morgan] Okay.

192
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,829
- It does feel weird...
- [phone chimes]

193
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,331
- Wait.
- [Morgan] I agree. It's weird.

194
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,397
Is that him?

195
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,067
No, it's my pharmacy
telling me to pick up my Xanax.

196
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,861
- Well, you better go get it.
- You think I sound crazy?

197
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,571
- [Morgan] No!
- Oh, crazy? No. No.

198
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,366
- I'm just joking.
- We're all a little crazy. Come here.

199
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,160
[chuckles] My little angel.

200
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,329
That's nice.

201
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:02,250
- What was the last thing you texted him?
- Oh, I sent... Well, just read it.

202
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,417
Okay.

203
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,710
I think I nailed it.

204
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,754
Mm-hmm. I'm sure you did.

205
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,008
I'm sorry. "I think I might be pregnant"?

206
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,011
Don't just read that part.
You have to read the first text.

207
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,472
Okay. "That was a great kiss."

208
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:21,394
Yeah, it's a joke. "That was a great kiss.
I think I might be pregnant." It's funny.

209
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,646
- Ooh.
- I don't get it.

210
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:27,024
Listen. Okay, guys
do not like pregnancy jokes.

211
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,945
He's confused. He's a rabbi.
He has a different brain than you.

212
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:34,198
Come on, you have to admit
you guys are a weird pair, no?

213
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,033
- Why?
- Why what?

214
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,828
Why are we a weird pair?
Just because he's a rabbi?

215
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,289
No, I'm just saying,
you know, like, when I met him,

216
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,584
he seemed very... responsible

217
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,793
and, like, kind.

218
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:46,961
And you...

219
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,838
Have edge, dear.

220
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:49,964
I'm not a bad person.

221
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,424
We're not saying that you are.

222
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,552
We're just saying
that you're, like, sort of a bad person

223
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,846
relative to a man of God.

224
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,264
[Lynn] Yeah.

225
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,601
I could see you with a cult leader.

226
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,227
That I could see.

227
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,938
[gentle music playing]

228
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,442
- Noah.
- Huh?

229
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,612
- Noah!
- What? What?

230
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,780
What do you... What? What do you wanna say?

231
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,324
So... so many things.

232
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,660
Uh, the woman in there, the goddess
who's always been too good for you,

233
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,579
she is currently fighting for her life.

234
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,142
My dad just said she's gonna be fine.

235
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,834
- Your dad doesn't know shit.
- Actually, he was almost a doctor.

236
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,420
Yeah, and I almost fucked
Adam Levine in 2003,

237
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,340
but you don't see me flying high
on the Maroon 5 jet, do ya?

238
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,674
Was it worth it?

239
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,635
Was what worth it?

240
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:39,180
Your little blonde friend who can't stop
talking about ass play on her podcast.

241
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,474
You were just talking about
fucking Adam Levine.

242
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,059
- Almost...
- You fucked Adam Levine?

243
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,646
Almost fucked Adam Levine.
And honestly, at least he's Jewish.

244
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,482
I know my man's Jewish.
When did you almost fuck Adam Levine?

245
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,108
[Esther] In Cabo, baby. You know this.

246
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,526
We are not done here, Noah.

247
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,944
What are we even doing?

248
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,571
Yeah, what are we doing? I'm lost.

249
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,031
I'll tell you what he's doing.

250
00:10:57,114 --> 00:11:00,159
He's throwing away a relationship
with literally the perfect woman.

251
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,577
Okay, okay.

252
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,915
Listen. She's not dying.
You can still be friends with her.

253
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,958
Yeah, you can still be friends with her.

254
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,753
But you're not just breaking up with her.

255
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,464
You're breaking up the whole family.

256
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,551
Strong Jewish guilt you're giving.

257
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,762
Yeah. I feel like you could use a little.

258
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:20,845

259
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,724

[gentle music playing]

261
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,274
Breaking up the family?
What the fuck? I'm sorry, man.

262
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,193
Honey, Adam Levine?

263
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,695
Was that so hard to believe?

264
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,030
[Sasha] I don't know.
You just seem, like, aggressive.

265
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,825
He seems like...
More like a gentle type, I guess.

266
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,910
[gentle music continues]

267
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,712
I mean, it's pretty late.
Maybe he just hasn't seen it yet.

268
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,507
I sent it 15 minutes
after we left each other.

269
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,051
You think he's just, like, at home

270
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,554
and, you know, brushing his teeth,
getting ready for bed,

271
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:05,307
setting his alarm from his phone,
and then didn't check his texts?

272
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,934
No. No, he's seen it for sure.

273
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,812
God! Why do I always have to make a joke?

274
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,315
Most girls would be like, "That was
a lovely night. I had a great time."

275
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,692
But most girls are boring.

276
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,153
Guys seem to like that.

277
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,197
But, like, who cares
what they like, right?

278
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,241
Yes! Yes!

279
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,784
Who cares?

280
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:24,994
I certainly don't.

281
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,203
I'm not spiraling.

282
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:30,374
It... I mean, I stand by the fact
that it was a joke

283
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,294
because it was, and it was funny,
and I kissed him very well.

284
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,211
I'm sure.

285
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,173
So I'm not worried about that at all

286
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,259
because I know I'm a great kisser,
and I'm good. I'm totally good.

00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,675
um, a mint, and a hair tie.

336
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:49,972
- Want any of these? Come here.
- [whimpering]

337
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,473
Hey.

338
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,350
Hi.

339
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,728
Hi.

340
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:56,937
[gentle music playing]

341
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,063
Come here.

342
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,900
You know what?
This is my favorite sweatshirt,

343
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,611
and they discontinued it,
but I'm gonna ruin it for ya.

344
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,780
Whoo. Okay. Hi.

345
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,326
[sighs] Oh.

346
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,579
- It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
- [dog whines]

347
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,163
Oh, dog.

348
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,918
Can I ask you a question?

349
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,629
Having known me for the last 30 seconds,

350
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,341
do you think I'm good enough
to be with someone who's, like,

351
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,927
really good?

352
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,595
Like, extremely good?

353
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,679
[whines]

354
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,767
Okay. I'm gonna take that as a yes.

355
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,268
[chuckles]

356
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,562
Well, that's kind of fun. Okay, um...

357
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,481
Should I get bangs?

358
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,652
Okay. No bangs.

359
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,694
All right.

360
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,989
[gentle music continues]

361
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,744
Oh my God. With all the tourists
and the screaming and the <i>kvetching,</i>

362
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,331
it's hard to think straight in there.

363
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,414
Yeah.

364
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,669
Most of that noise
is just people yelling at me.

365
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,003
Oh, come on.

366
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,422
I've been sitting here

367
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,094
thinking, I wonder if I am the reason
that Rebecca got into an accident.

368
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,053
Oh, stop that.

369
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,640
How selfish is it
to want someone new and exciting,

370
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,352
no matter how long it would last,
no matter who it hurts?

371
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,689
Just been wondering
if I'm a terrible person.

372
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,940
You, a terrible person?

373
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,026
Come on. Not a chance.

374
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,695
Be honest.

375
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,366
Do you think I'm making a mistake
ending things with Rebecca?

376
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,952
- You're asking me?
- I'm asking.

377
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:41,375
Noah, I think Rebecca is a wonderful girl.

378
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,334
She's terrific.

379
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,754
I think with a girl like this on your arm,
you'll have a beautiful life.

380
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,883
On the other hand, Noah,

381
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,803
you're gonna be the one
who'll have to live with the regret

382
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,388
or the joy of this decision.

383
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,599
Only you. Not Esther.
Not your mother. Certainly not me.

384
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,145
I have my wife for many years.
I'm very happy.

385
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,855
If you tell her that I said any of this,

386
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,658
I'll deny it
because she'll come to kill me.

387
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,569
Are we doing big hugs?

388
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,989
Yeah, let me get in on that.
Oh, yeah. [grunts]

389
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,116
[gentle music playing]

390
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,788
[dog whines]

391
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,631
Noah?

392
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,427
Hey. Did you get a dog?

393
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,720
What are you doing here?

394
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,639
Well, uh...

395
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,727
I had a rough night.
Tell you about it later.

396
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:47,024
But I just found myself driving over here
on the off chance I'd get to see you.

397
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,027
Then I thought maybe it's a bit much
to ring your doorbell at 2:00 a.m.

398
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,656
So... I was trying to decide if I should
just leave and never admit I came here.

399
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,533
Did you get my texts?

400
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,745
'Cause when you didn't text back,
I kind of got in my head about it.

401
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:00,871
[Noah] You're pregnant.

402
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,165
Congratulations. That's amazing.

403
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,459
I knew I was a good kisser, but this...

404
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,461
I mean, this has never happened to me.

405
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:11,590
[laughs] See? I knew it was funny,
and I knew you'd get it.

406
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,636
Why didn't you text back?

407
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:19,223
I didn't get the text till 20 minutes ago.
I left the phone in my car.

408
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:20,932
Sorry about that.

409
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,061
So, uh,

410
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,564
who's this handsome gentleman
or gentlelady

411
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,275
that, uh, you're coming home with so late?

412
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,860
Just some cutie I picked up.

413
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,487
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

414
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,780
Should I be jealous?

415
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
I mean,

416
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,828
this thick boy did stare deeply
into my eyes the entire way home,

417
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,413
and I felt very seen, so maybe.

418
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,873
Okay. I am, then.

419
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,168
- Where'd you find him?
- On the street.

420
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,086
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

421
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,506
My friend runs a rescue place, so I'm
gonna bring him there in the morning.

422
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,301
Well, you saved a dog tonight.
You did a <i>mitzvah.</i>

423
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,636
It's a good deed.

424
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,431
Oh. Yeah, I did a <i>mitzvah.</i>

425
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,515
Yeah.

426
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,394
- May I? You have a...
- What?

427
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,520
...twig in your hair.

428
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,456
- [Joanne] Oh God.
- You have a lot in your hair.

429
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,234
- [Joanne] What?
- Well, leaves and... just foliage.

430
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,317
[Joanne chuckles]

431
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,822
I'm glad to see you.

432
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,073
Glad to see you too.

433
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,077
