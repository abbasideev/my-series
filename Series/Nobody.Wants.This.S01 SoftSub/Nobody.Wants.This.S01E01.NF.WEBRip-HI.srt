00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,320
Morgan, I asked you
to park down the street.

7
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,906
Okay, I am not your chauffeur,
and I needed cash, so...

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,907
Who even uses cash?

9
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,869
Okay. Mom always says
when the world ends, you better have cash.

10
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,347
Can we please walk?
I don't want him to come out and find me.

11
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,248
Okay. Wait, so what happened in there?

12
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,293
Okay, he seemed totally normal
while we were messaging each other.

13
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,536
Then we sit down for a drink,

14
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,921
and he starts crying
about how his grandmother died.

15
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,005
Oh, that's sad.

16
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,008
- No, Morgan, when he was 12.
- Oh.

17
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,885
He said it was, quote, "Still raw."

18
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,887
Okay. Well. A little bit much.

19
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,432
Oh my God. He's texting me,
asking me where I went. What a psychopath.

20
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,910
- Did you not tell him where you went?
- I just met this guy.

21
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:03,354
- I have to tell him every move I make?
- Save it for the podcast, Joanne.

22
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,190
[Joanne] I'm sorry, am I the asshole?

23
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:08,433
No, no, no, no, no. No, grandmas die.
Like, you know, that's, like, their thing.

24
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,321
Anyway, this guy's grandma
had a really good life.

25
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,489
She was a Rockette.

26
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,991
She spent 42 years
with her soulmate, William,

27
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,118
and I shouldn't know so much
about this woman

28
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,412
because I was on the date for 30 minutes.

29
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,748
- Can I say what everyone's thinking?
- Be my guest.

30
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:22,874
Okay, great. Thank you.

31
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,044
We've done this podcast
for, like, what, 119 episodes,

32
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,798
and this story you're telling,
it just sounds, like, very familiar.

33
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,258
I have never dated a guy
who was in love with his grandma.

34
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:36,513
I'm talking about when you find a nice,
normal guy, and you find fault with him.

35
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,349
It's like, I don't know
if you actually wanna meet somebody.

36
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,558
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

37
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,685
Remember Greg?
I dated him for eight months.

38
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,145
I was utterly obsessed with him.

39
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,232
Yeah, I do remember him,
and he did not acknowledge you in public.

40
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,191
Yeah.

41
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,693
Which is maybe what it takes
for you to like someone.

42
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,777
Hmm.

43
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,656
Someone who's emotionally unavailable.

44
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,158
- We all understood what you were saying.
- Okay.

45
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,913
[sighs] All right, I could make
healthier relationship choices.

46
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:03,665
And I will.

47
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,874
- Great.
- Going forward.

48
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,920
I mean, he literally had a photo
of him and his grandma on his profile.

49
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,548
- The signs were there.
- Yeah, that's on me.

Oh shit. What is it?

55

Is Esther cheating on me?

56

- Whatever. I'll stay with her.
- No.

57
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,243
You have to stop

{\an8}- Okay, the game has not started yet.

{\an8}- Good?
- For me?

65
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,343
{\an8}- For you. Hi.
- Thank you.

66
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:01,890
{\an8}- Um, this is for you. Let's do this.
- Oh yes. <i>Pamplemousse.</i>

to come over, but, you know, I lost her

00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,442
{\an8}as soon as I said
we were watching the game.

72
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,565
{\an8}- [Sash] Oh, that makes sense.
- [Beck] Here you go.

- What's on your hand?

74
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,449
{\an8}- Um...
- Oh, it's an engagement ring.

75
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,701
{\an8}Whoa, did you guys get engaged?

{\an8}[laughs awkwardly] Okay.

79
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,502
{\an8}So, I, like, randomly found it...
It's so weird.

80
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:35,215
{\an8}...a few months ago, in, like,
the bottom drawer of your desk.

81
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,426
{\an8}- The desk that was locked?
- Yeah, that one.

82
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,804
{\an8}But it's so funny because I also, like,
randomly found the key.

83
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,306
{\an8}I don't know how, but...

84
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,933
{\an8}- Rebecca.
- Yeah, I know.

85
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,560
{\an8}You can't go around
unlocking all my stuff.

86
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,479
{\an8}It's a violation of privacy.

87
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,899
{\an8}You were clearly gonna propose anyway,
and I don't know what was taking so long.

88
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,277
So now we can just, like,
skip past the "will you marry me," part

00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,529
'cause I say yes.

90
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:02,492

I wanted it to be romantic.

to that place in Santa Barbara you like.

really run-down now.

93
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,915
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

94
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:09,832
I read that too.

95
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,919
That it's, like, the whole place smells
like seawater, you know.

96
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,004
I'll let... let you guys finish up.

97
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,841
Speaking of places, I spoke to your mom,
and we found this wedding venue...

98
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,302
You talked to my mom about this?

99
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,637
I always talk to your mom.

100
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,889
Oh my God! That's not okay.

101
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,433
Noah, I don't understand
what the disconnect here is.

102
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,797
- You don't?
- [Rebecca] I don't.

103
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,063
Hon, we're together, then we get married.

104
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,440
- It's just not that complicated.
- [Noah] I don't know.

105
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,360
It seems like you're checking off
items on a list, and I...

106
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,862
I don't think that's how it should feel.

107
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,324
I don't know what it is
that you were, like, "expecting to feel,"

108
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,953
but this... this is it.

109
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,746
Okay? This... this...

110
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,416
This is the feeling.

[poignant music playing]

112
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,839
I'm sorry, Beck. I don't think it is.

[poignant music continues]

114
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,933
- [woman] Really? You would?
- A competition makes it fun.

115
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,394
Can we get a few slices
of your cheesecake?

116
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,146
- Uh, with a candle.
- [waiter] Of course.

117
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,397
Special occasion?

118
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,958
- It's our anniversary.
- [waiter] Aw.

119
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,567
Of the day they got separated.

120
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,985
Why do we do this every year?

121
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,070
Because some divorces
are meant to be celebrated.

122
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,280
[chuckles] Like yours.

123
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:27,118
Meanwhile, this one and I
were together for 32 beautiful years.

124
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,705
We only separated because he was
a bit confused about his sexuality.

125
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,790
Not confused, Lynnie-bear. 100% sure.

126
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,834
It's very trendy to be gay these days.

127
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,002
- Mom.
- [Joanne] What?

128
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,628
- Are you gay?
- You cannot ask that.

129
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,072
- You don't out someone.
- No. You can... You save yourself.

130
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,318
- [man] Don't answer that.
- I'll be back with desserts.

131
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,342
Thanks, handsome.

132
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,483
[Lynn] I've been meaning to tell you all.

133
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,722
I went to the doctor the other day,

134
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,849
and she discovered something awful.

135
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:50,975
- What?
- [man] Oh!

136
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,604
I noticed it the second you walked in.
Your skin is this awful blue.

137
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,481
Please put the phone away. What's wrong?

138
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,191
Uh, I went to see Birch.

139
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,714
- Who the fuck is Birch?
- Oh my God.

140
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,862
Birch is her sound therapist.
Okay, she is not a doctor, Mom.

141
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,448
We thought were telling us you had cancer.
Don't do that.

142
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,367
- She's a voice biologist.
- Okay.

143
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,371
And she discovered that when I speak,
I'm missing the note C.

144
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,454
Okay.

145
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,999
[Lynn] The note C
is directly related to your colon,

146
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,710
and the colon is directly related to...

147
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,962
Guess it.

Deep sadness.

150
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,425
- Okay. We have a diagnosis.
- [Morgan] Mom.

151
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,677
You've got to stop going to this woman.

152
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,864
- It's a New York area code.
- [man] Bless your heart.

153
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,349
- It's gotta be about the podcast.
- Oh my God!

Dad, move. I need you to move.

<i>So keep that up
and everything should fall into place.</i>

167
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,049
We will. And... and this show has legs
for a spin-off and a book deal.

168
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,135
I have an idea of something
we could produce...

169
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,636
Um, will we get nice offices?

170
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,847
- [James] <i>Okay, I've gotta jump. Talk soon.</i>
- Okay.

171
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,933
- Great. Yes. Great. Thank you, James. Bye.
- Thank you! Oh my God.

<i>It looks like you're in bed.</i>

177
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,201
The world is my office, Ashley.

178
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,330
Must be nice. I'm just working
on this ad packet for the podcast.

179
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,014
You could be doing that from bed,
but we all have our own process.

Jo, are you coming here tonight
for the dinner party?

Who's gonna be there? Bunch of lesbians?

183
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,383
No.

184
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,593
Not as many as usual.

a finance guy and a rabbi.

188
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,314
Oh, I thought you were starting
a bad joke. Um...

189
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,774
They all sound terrible. I'll be there.

190
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,069
- Perfect. Dress like a huge slut.
- I'll borrow something from your mom.

[Ashley] Finally.

00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,129
- Mm. Mwah.
- Oh.

199
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,839
Ew. Not gay for you.

200
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,924
- Okay?
- I tried.

00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,134
What is this?
What are you wearing? It's disgusting.

[Ashley] Okay, this is a cry for help.

204
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,598
I found it in the back
of my dad's closet, so maybe.

205
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,142
- Hi, everyone. I'm Joanne.
- [man] How's it going?

206
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,186
You can relax. It's... it's fake.

- Hi.
- [Joanne] Hi.

- Oh, can you hand me that corkscrew?
- Sure.

- Here. Let me open that for ya.
- Oh. Thank you.

you should be drinking?

You seem to be going through something.

215
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,379
Oh, no.
I'm just in constant need of attention.

216
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,756
I respect that. I also like attention.

217
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,050
I say I don't, but... I do.

00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,319
- [Joanne] You do, right?
- Yes.

219
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,887
- Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud?
- Yeah.

- Yes.
- Yes.

You know what else feels good?

226
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,941
To, um, say something embarrassing,
like, the second that you meet someone.

227
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,568
- Okay.
- [Joanne] I'll go first.

228
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,113
Um, oh, I had this clear mole
removed from my face

229
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,676
that no one ever noticed, right here.

230
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,324
And now the scar is,

231
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,994
I think, way more noticeable
than the clear mole ever was.

232
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,717
I feel like it's all anyone's staring at.

Yeah, no, I don't see it at all.
Um, something embarrassing for me.

What a comeback!

243
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,021
Um, am I supposed to say
something embarrassing?

244
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,464

- Does this count?

Joanne. That's an old-fashioned name.

- I like that.
- [Joanne] Mm.

260
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,595

- [Joanne] Noah.

Oh! Did you know there's a rabbi here?

263
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,184
No shit.

264
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,810
- [Joanne] Yeah.
- Where?

265
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,106
Um, I don't see him now,
but he has a beard,

266
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,691
and he was definitely judging me.

267
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,693
- Sounds like a rabbi.
- [Joanne laughs]

268
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,570
How do you know Ashley?

00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,657
Uh, we're in a Neighborhood Watch
program together.

270
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,533
- We're basically both Karens.
- Oh wow.

271
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,869
Yeah. Um, I think she only invited me

272
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,205
'cause I'm kind of going through
a breakup thing,

273
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,831
and I think she felt sorry for me.

274
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,915

He's perfect for your podcast.

291

- Go for it.
- [Joanne] Why? What's wrong with him?

292
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,714
- He's a condescending asshole.
- Really?

293
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,843
I don't know why I invite him to
these things. I think I feel bad for him.

You're not an empath.

What do you like about it?

308

- You're embarrassing yourself.
- Thank you.

309
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,504
[Zara] Okay, you just did this episode
about what a bad idea it is

310
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,468
to have a three-way
with someone hotter than you

311
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,175
and it basically saved my marriage.

312
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,343
- Always be the hot one.
- [laughter]

313
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,138
- That's a good motto.
- [Joanne] Well, thank you.

314

- Who's your friend?
- [Ashley] Mm.

315
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,144
Yeah, her bad personality
is weirdly charming, right?

316
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,480
But she's into Gary for some reason.

317
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,441
No way she's into that guy.

318
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,902
Sorry. She has terrible taste.

319
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,196
I'm not asking for me.
I don't... I don't care.

320
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,113
Okay.

321
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,573
Is she Jewish at all?

322
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,076
[Ashley] There's not a Jewish bone
in her body.

323
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,037
Unless you put one in her.

324
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,120
Sh!

325
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,213
- [Ashley] Who eats just the crust?
- The crust is the best part.

326
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,674
The point is, he was clearly
tonguing someone who's not his wife.

[groans]

328
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,888
100%, if I knew my friend
was being cheated on, I'd tell him.

329
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,349
But we're not that close, you know?

330
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,769
Sounds like rabbi territory to me.

333
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,278
Wait. Why are you talking?

334
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,738
Jo, that's so rude.

335
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,322
What are you...

336
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,992
- Isn't he the rabbi?
- The fuck?

337
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,787
I'm not a fucking rabbi.

338
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,957
I've written three number-one
<i>New York Times</i> bestsellers.

339
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,460
Ever heard of <i>The Apparition Effect</i>
by Gary Howell?

340
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,711
Uh...

341
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,297
You have. It's everywhere.

342
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,424
Oh, you're the asshole.

343
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,384
I've earned it.

344
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,467
And

345
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,638
you're the rabbi?

346
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,432
I'm the rabbi.

347
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,812
Um... [clears throat]

348
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,607
So your dilemma is
basically respecting someone's privacy

349
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,693
versus preventing harm.

350
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,697
I'm gonna paraphrase, uh,
Rabbi Ishmael in the <i>Talmud</i>

351
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,699
when he says someone who engages in gossip

352
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,660
is equal in sin
to somebody who commits murder.

353
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,036
Bit of a drama queen,

354
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,540
but still, I think in this case,
gossip is the worst option.

355
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,586
I think the rabbi says
keep it to yourself.

356
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,506
- I think I'll still tell her.
- [all laugh]

357
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,591
Okay.

358
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,597
You're a real-life rabbi?

359
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,390
It's hot, right?

360
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:53,933
I mean...

361
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,478
- Sort of.
- [Noah chuckles]

362
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,150
I tell my sister
every time a guy is cheating on her.

363
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,319
- Yeah, you gotta tell your sister.
- [Joanne] Right.

364
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,613
Yeah. Are you guys close?

365
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,532
Yeah. She's my best friend
and my worst enemy.

366
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,326
I have one of those.

367
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,493
Hmm.

368

[exhales] I think I'm gonna go home.

369
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,174

- [Joanne laughs]

370
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,884
No, you are, um...

371

372

- [Joanne] Thank you.

[Noah] You know what? Let me walk you out.

376
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,440
My God, you're obsessed with me.

377
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,275
- I was gonna leave anyway.
- Were you?

378
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,401
Eventually.

379
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,070
[gentle music playing]

380
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,153
Yeah.

381
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,240
I mean, it's very nice,
but it's making my eyes burn.

382
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,324
Ah.

383
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,284
Yeah.

384
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,579
Here you go. It's cold.

385
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,541
Whatever cologne you're wearing,
I approve.

386
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,834
It's fabric softener.

387
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,796
I didn't park close. Bottom of the hill.

388
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,922
Perfect. Me too.

389
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,344
Can you have sex?

390
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,262
Right now?

391
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,847
No. Like, in general.

392
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:14,765
Yes.

393
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,558
That's priests. We're just people.

394
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,813
Are you even a little bit Jewish?
Like an aunt or a great-grandmother?

395
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,106

396
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,233
Nope. Why?

397
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,611
Well, rabbi, <i>gentile.</i>
It's pretty hard to pull off.

399

Plus, I don't believe in God.

400
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,994
Sorry, is that offensive
to say to a rabbi?

401
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,578
You can say anything you want.

402
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,624
Also, not that it matters,
but baked into the Jewish experience

403
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,502
is wrestling with what God is or isn't,
not knowing.

404
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,294
- Really?
- Yeah.

405
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,964
I didn't know that.

406
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,883
People always seem so clear
on what they imagine God to be.

407
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,012
I don't know.
None of it has ever felt right to me.

408
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,266
You feel like someone
whose parents are still married.

409
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,185
Do I? Yeah. 41 years.

410
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,269
- Wow!
- You?

411
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,564
Uh, my dad is gay.

412
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,108
- Oh.
- My mom is still in love with him.

413
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,862

with her Uber driver.

I can say something that would scare you.

Oh, you scare me, Joanne. You do.

420
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,127
- I do?
- Yeah. You're terrifying.

421
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:29,965
You're an unfiltered, complicated,
vulnerable, beautiful woman.

Mm-hmm. I read your mind at the dinner
when you were looking at me.

430
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,404
It was very inappropriate.

00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:41,550
I was out to dinner enjoying a steak,

505
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:45,512
and I was enjoying it a little bit
too much because I began to choke.

506
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,975
And I looked around at my table for help,

507
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,185
and I don't wanna name any names,

508
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,272
but let's just say that everybody froze.

509
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,025
Oh, actually, I do wanna name names.
Rabbi Simonson.

510
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,484
[laughter]

511
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,736
- [laughs]
- [Noah] Sorry.

512
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,032
A very interesting thing happens
when you think you might die.

513
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,868
You have this panicked desire,

514
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,954
this panicked need
to know if you've lived your life right.

515
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,750
If you've done enough,
if you've said enough.

516
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,959
Was it all worth it?

517
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,671
I don't wanna spoil it for you,
but I... I did survive.

518
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,465
[laughter]

519
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,550
[tender music playing]

520
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,472
[clears throat] And you know that parable

521
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,350
about the man who's
stranded on a roof during a flood,

522
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,603
and every time
somebody comes by to help him, he says,

523
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,147
"Nope, God will save me."

524
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,817
And in the end, he dies,
and he says to God,

525
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,945
"I've lived by your word.
Why didn't you save me?"

526
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,781
And God says,

527
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,825
"I sent you a life jacket and a boat

528
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,243
and a helicopter."

529
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,995
"That was me, buddy."

530
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,334
We have all these chances to wake up
and change the course of our lives.

531
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,882
Everything can have purpose
if you allow it.

532
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,594
Thinking about switching careers?

533
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,221
Maybe that's God pushing you.

534
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,931
Hesitating about a big decision?

535
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,308
That could be God telling you
to think twice.

536
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,685
Thinking about going all in on crypto?

537
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,979
Might not be God.
Ask your accountant what they think.

538
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,231
[laughter]

539
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,274
I gave him that crypto joke.

540
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,943
But if you think God's plan

541
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,863
is supposed to feel
like something specific,

542
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,741
and you haven't felt it...

543
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:36,164
and you wonder if we're all in
on some big secret that you aren't in on,

544
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,374
let me tell you,

545
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,709
you're in on it.

546
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,131
<i>Shabbat Shalom.</i>

547
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,674
[all] <i>Shabbat Shalom.</i>

548
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,472
That was a weird sermon.

549
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,307
Thanks, Mom. Hi.

550
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,225
[woman 1] Rabbi.

551
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,978
- I'd like you to meet my daughter, Alissa.
- [Noah] Oh, hello.

552
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,273
- She graduated from hospitality school.
- Oh, wonderful.

553
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,358
Rita, you're suffocating him.

554
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:04,818
- Rabbi.
- Hi.

555
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,571
You remember my niece Isabel
from <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> services.

556
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,240
- Of course, yes.
- [woman 2] She just got over shingles.

557
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:13,618
Okay, <i>mazel tov, mazel tov.</i>
Excuse me, ladies, one second.

558
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,953
I will be right back.

559
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,663
- I'll be right back.
- [woman 3] Rabbi.

560
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,165
[Noah] Hi, one second.

561
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,041
One moment. I'll be right back.

562
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,421
[upbeat music playing]

563
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,505
Rabbi.

564
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,257
Joanne.

565
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,474
Who the hell is that?
