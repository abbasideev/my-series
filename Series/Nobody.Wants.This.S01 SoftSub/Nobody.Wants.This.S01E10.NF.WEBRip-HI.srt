00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,591
[upbeat music playing]

2
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:20,770
I love making out on a weekday.
It feels like high school.

3
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,981
Mm. Same, yeah.

4
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,943
High school was also
a very sexual time for me too.

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,027
[Joanne chuckles]

6
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:29,988
[man] Order for Noah!

7
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:32,949
- That's me.
- Mm.

8
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,035
[upbeat music continues]

9
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:38,912
[Noah] Thank you.

10
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,623
Mm.

11
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,278
- Thank you.
- [cell phone chimes]

12
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,839
Your girl Bina just texted.

13
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:50,216
- Yeah, that is my girl.
- Yeah.

14
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:54,471
Very excited you're coming
to the <i>bat mitzvah.</i> It's your first one.

15
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,222
- That's so exciting.
- Yeah.

16
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,391
Getting to spend
a little more time with the fam?

17
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,393
[chuckles] I am so excited too.

18
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,646
[Joanne clears throat]

19
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,523
[continues clearing throat]

20
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,317
- You okay?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,320
I woke up with a little tickle
in my throat this morning.

22
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,905
Really? You didn't mention it.

23
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,323
[coughing]

24
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,826
Oh God. Well, I wasn't sure, but now I am.

25
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,121
I mean, this is always how I feel
right before I get really sick.

26
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:25,168
[exhales] Hope it doesn't stop me
from going to the <i>bat mitzvah.</i>

27
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,796
But... it probably will.

28
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,132
Oh! Okay.

29
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,761
I'll be really bummed
if you can't make it, but if you're sick...

30
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,684
Yeah, I... Believe me,
I'm gonna be bummed too.

31
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,683
Oh, oh, oh, probably shouldn't have coffee
with a sore throat, you know?

32
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,102
- Oh!
- Yeah.

33
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,812
- Yeah.
- 'Cause you're sick.

34
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,563
Good call.

35
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,733
- [Ryann] So you're not really sick?
- Mm, of course not.

36
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,152
But there is no way
I'm going to that <i>bat mitzvah</i>

37
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,446
after his mom
whispered her curse in my ear.

38
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,448
Well, have you told Noah what she said?

39
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,618
I can't. His mom is, like,
his favorite person on the planet.

40
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,703
Yeah. Yeah. It's a tough situation.

41
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,627
[Ryann] Is this
just because you're not Jewish?

42
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,999
Just... be Jewish.

43
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,876
- I don't see what the problem is.
- What?

44
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,630
Well, Noah actually did ask me
if I would ever consider converting,

45
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,715
and I'm kind of open to it.

46
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:17,387
- I mean, that's a big decision.
- [Ryann] No, you should totally convert.

47
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,224
It's perfect because it's not like you
stand for anything or have strong beliefs.

48
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,434
[Ashley] No! She stands for things.

49
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,187
- Feminism. You're a fan of that, right?
- Right.

50
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,690
You refuse to pay on dates.
You stand for things.

51
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,860
Yeah, but what's the difference
if you're Jewish or not Jewish?

52
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,655
I'll tell you what makes a difference.
A hot boyfriend who owns a home,

53
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,825
or you die alone, no home.

54
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,952
- You know what I'm saying?
- I do like Noah.

55
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,204
- [Ryann] Yeah.
- And I really wanna be with him.

56
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,165
- I feel like I could do it.
- [Ryann] Yeah.

57
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,376
- I've reinvented myself dozens of times.
- [Ashley] True.

58
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,545
- I was goth in high school.
- I love that picture.

59
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,356
- Unforgettable.
- I was a lesbian for a year.

60
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,460
- Uh...
- Hummana-hummana...

61
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,466
I mean, what do you think it even takes?

62
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,011
- Wait.
- Well, okay. Let's see.

63
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,137
I feel like I know.

64
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,240
- Would you like more coffee?
- [Joanne] Yes, please.

65
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,976
- Judaism for dummies.
- How to be Jewish.

66
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,770
- [Joanne] Thank you.
- Fun fact. I'm Jewish.

67
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,939
- Okay. Slay.
- Oh.

68
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,525
- [Ryann] Think he owns his own home?
- [Ashley] Okay.

69
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,985
- That was a sign.
- [Ryann] Yeah.

70
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:18,781
Apparently, you have to study
for two years and possibly wear a wig.

71
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,658
Uh, what?

72
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,660
No. I found <i>Become Jewish in Six Weeks.</i>

73
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,329
- No wigs. It says no wigs.
- What?

74
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,582
Hey! Okay, no wig. I'll take it.

75
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,042
- I did it.
- [Joanne] All right.

76
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,005
- [Ryann] Yeah. Great.
- I think I should do it.

77
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,546
- Wow! One lunch, and she's... Jewish.
- A lesbian.

78
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,505
Jewish, yeah.

79
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,275
- [Ashley] She's Jewish.
- [Ryann] To Jewish.

80
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,299
<i>Matzah!</i>

81
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,719
[buoyant music playing]

82
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,723
[music fading]

83
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,893
[Sasha] I know my mom picked
the <i>bat mitzvah</i> theme,

84
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,520
but "Miriam Takes a Bite
of the Big Apple."

85
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,356
- Listen...
- Honey, I gotta tell you.

86
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,233
- This theme sucks.
- Yeah, it does.

87
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,819
Between the theme and Miriam's ugly dress,
there's no turning back now.

88
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,863
It's what your mom wanted,
and she's paying.

89
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,698
This swag doesn't even make any sense.

90
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,118
What? Apple plus pizza plus Jewish star?

91
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,222
- How does that equal Miriam?
- [Sasha] I don't know.

92
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,541
That is so cute. Oh my God.
I get it. Equals Miriam. [chuckles]

93
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,295
- [Esther] Where's the other box of swag?
- [Sasha] Uh, I think it's inside.

94
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,091
Hey.

95
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,596
Nervous about Rebecca and Joanne
being in the same room later?

96
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,014
[sighs] Nope.

97
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,225
Because she's not coming.

98
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,727
- [Sasha] Why not?
- Too sick. So she says.

99
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,938
She's been weird
since brunch with Mom and Dad.

100
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,398
Of course she's acting weird.

101
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,234
You're going a hundred miles an hour
with that tiny elf.

102
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:40,738
You've been together for a few months,
and you're talking about converting.

103
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,157
I think I freaked her out
a little bit, didn't I?

104
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,241
Maybe.

105
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,246
[sighs] Look, I know it's way too early
to be discussing this stuff,

106
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,956
but truth is, you know,

107
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,584
we don't really have a future
if she's not open to being Jewish.

108
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,880
What does Morgan think about this?
Is she cool with Joanne tribing up?

109
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,591
I don't know. They're still fighting.

110
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,097
I've been sworn to secrecy on something,
and I... I gotta get it off my chest,

111
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,182
but I feel
it's gonna piss people off if I say it.

112
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,436
- No, no. You gotta let me say it.
- No. I don't engage in gossip.

113
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,729
<i>Lashon hara.</i>

114
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,273
Is it about me?

115
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,192
Would it change your opinion on gossip
if it was about you?

116
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,276
Well, is it?

117
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,988
- Not directly, but...
<i>- Lashon hara.</i>

118
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,034
[mellow music playing]

119
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,415
Oh my God. I don't know where...

120
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,498
[music fades]

121
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,812
If you think I'm gonna help you
set up that microphone, you're wrong.

122
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,963
Does it look like
I'm asking you to help me?

123
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,174
I feel like it looks like
I'm doing it myself.

124
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,550
- Thank you.
- No, you got it.

125
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:46,179
Stay committed. If you just keep
jamming it in there, it'll eventually fit.

126
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,930
It sounds like you in your twenties.

127
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,808
- [both pretend to laugh]
- [cell phone ringing]

128
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,770
- Where is this?
- Care to tell me why Sasha's calling you?

129
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,357
Oh, let me get that.
Will you just give it to me?

130
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,793
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything. Give me my phone!

131
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,112
- Answer it on speakerphone now.
- Give me my phone. Okay, I will. Stop it.

132
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:07,867
[clears throat] Hi, Sasha. Uh, why are you
calling me? We barely know each other.

133
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,995
[Sasha] <i>I have something to tell you.
I'm not used to keeping secrets,</i>

134
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,039
<i>but I need sweet release
from these chains.</i>

135
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,434
- Well, now is not a good time, so...
- [Sasha] <i>Rebecca lied.</i>

136
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,710
<i>You were compromised the entire time.</i>

137
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:21,214
<i>She knew who you were, and she just wanted
to mess with Noah and Joanne.</i>

138
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,050
<i>Nothing she said was true.
Oh my God, that felt so good.</i>

139
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,761
<i>Look, I gotta go.
Don't tell Esther I told you.</i>

140
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,096
Wow.

141
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,681
- Mm.
- Oh my God, you were telling the truth.

142
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,642
[Morgan] Yeah.

143
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,726
I was wrong.

144
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,229
I'm s... so sorry. What was that?

145
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,608
I said you were right, and I was wrong.

146
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,901
I'm sorry.

147
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:42,984
Yeah.

148
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,654
[exhales]

149
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,242
- We good?
- I'm sorry. You were awful to me, okay?

150
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,661
You called me a desperate, pathetic liar.

151
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,705
I know, but my apology just now,
like, included all of that stuff.

152
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:55,869
What do you want me to say?

153
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,709
I want you
to get down on your knees and beg.

154
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:02,713
Morgan, I just washed these jeans.
They're too tight to kneel down.

155
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,174
[whispers] I don't care. Come on.

156
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,593
[sighs] Okay, I'll do it, you psycho.

157
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,677
Thank you.

158
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,806
Morgan, I'm sorry.

159
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:15,184
Mm-mm. That was bad.
You can do it again, better.

160
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,688
Okay, look, I know we like
to give each other shit.

161
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,772
[Morgan] Mm-hmm.

162
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,776
But the truth is,
you're an amazing business partner,

163
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,736
and you're an even better sister.

164
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,573
I know we don't say it enough,
but I love you.

165

Good man.

And you can have some of my sweets.
I'm trying to get down to fighting weight.

And I ate some of them, but

Hey!

513
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,735
- Hi.
- I wondered where you went.

514
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,196
I have some big news to tell you.

515
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,614
- [Joanne] Okay.
- [Noah] Okay.

516
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,741
Okay.

517
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,995
I'm gonna be the new head rabbi.

- [Noah] Thank you. Thank you.
- Oh.

522
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,712
- You deserve it!
- [Noah] Mm.

523
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,880
Thank you.

524
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,051
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,134
Yeah?

526
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,511
[Joanne] Um...

527
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,351
There's something I need to tell you,
and I wanna tell you. It's just hard.

528
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,060
I love you.

529
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,817
- You stole my line.
- I'm sorry.

530
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,569
I love you too.

531
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,823
- But...
- What? No but.

532
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:31,159
But... because I love you,

533
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,829
I can't convert.

534
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,333
I'm just not ready, and I, um...

535
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,127
In so many ways, I wanna be.

536
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,210
[Noah] Okay.

537
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,047
But if I'm being honest,

538
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,968
I was only doing it for you.

539
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,263
And there's so many beautiful things
about Judaism.

540
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,642
And... I'm just not there yet.

541
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:59,521
And I... I don't know if I ever will be.

542
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,604
Okay.

543
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,692
Okay. We'll slow it down.

544
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,652
We can figure it out.

545
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,448
How? Noah, how?

546
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,785

Exactly.

00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,589
I see what's at stake now.

551
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:33,430
You need me to be something
that I can't promise that I can be.

552
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,933
And if I falter even a little bit,
