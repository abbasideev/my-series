00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,716
In spite of that, he was somehow able
to still get all the girls.

166
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,926
- Look at him now. All grown-up.
- I can see that.

167
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,430
And in line for this big head rabbi job.
Are the rumors true?

168
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,765
I... I don't know. Nothing's official.

169
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,350
Are you gonna kill me if I pull him?

170
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,686
There's a thousand people
who wanna say hi to him.

171
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,038
- We'll be back.
- [Joanne] Okay.

172
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,607
<i>Shalom!</i> That one meant goodbye.

173
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,069
I mean, look, guys.

174
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:07,987
[girls laugh]

175
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,281
- Wait, what's that?
- [girl] What is that?

176
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,908
What's up, ladies?

177
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,537
Camp is crazy, right? [chuckles]

178
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,706
Are you a new counselor?

179
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,707
Ew, no.

180
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,958
Are you dating Hot Rabbi?

181
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:25,004
You call him Hot Rabbi?
Oh my God, that makes me so proud.

182
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,381
One time, I pretended to choke
so he would do CPR on me.

183
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,382
Genius.

184
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,135
Yeah, but he just
hit me on the back a few times.

185
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,555
So, is he your boyfriend?

186
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,476
You know, when you're an adult,
it's a little more nuanced than that.

187
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,146
Uh, but, yeah, we definitely are a <i>we.</i>

188
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,565
I just heard him
introduce you as his friend.

189
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,527
Okay, again, nuance.

190
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,155
You probably didn't pick up the context
if you just heard it walking by.

191
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,990
Pretty sure we got the context.

192
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,078
Oh my God. She sounds like Shoshana.

193
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,247
- Yeah.
- Totally!

194
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,331
No, I don't.

195
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,834
Who's Shoshana?

196
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,419
- Me.
- Oh.

197
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:09,257
I was dating Elliot. We'd hang out,
but only at places no one would go.

198
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,008
Like Ralph's.

199
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,176
Who's Ralph?

200
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,636
The grocery store.

201
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,887
Oh Jesus.

202
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,557
He wouldn't sit next to me
on the bus ride to Haverim.

203
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,309
That's when I realized
he doesn't wanna be seen with me.

204
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,144
So I'm having my mom pick me up early.

205
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,772
Oh, your generation is so weak.

206
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,774
Okay. Uh... [sighs]

207
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,027
We can't let things like that
affect us, right?

208
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,114
One thing happens you don't like,
you call your mom to pick you up?

209
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,575
Besides, that's not
what's going on over here,

210
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:40,788
so if you'll excuse me,
I am gonna go find my boyfriend.

211
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,000
He was literally just like...

212
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,794
- He literally just called her his friend.
- Yeah.

213
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,213
Well, hello, Hot Rabbi.

214
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,465
[Noah groans]

215
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,634
- Did you hear about that?
- Yeah. They told me.

216
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,718
Oh no.

217
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,929
Practicing your <i>shaloms?</i>

218
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,974
Oh, I've been <i>shaloming</i> fast and loose
to everybody.

219
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,727
Fantastic. Would you like
to go to the cabin with me?

220
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,270
- Really? We just got here.
- Yeah.

221
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,939
I know, but I wanna do
Hot Rabbi things to you.

222
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,149
Oh, okay.

223
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,734
[upbeat music playing]

224
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:19,285
<i>♪ I can't win, I can't win ♪</i>

225
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:23,623
<i>♪ I just crumble up into whatever I was... ♪</i>

226
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,044
- [Joanne] You spent every summer here?
- [Noah] Just about.

227
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,046
Except for one
where I had the flu all summer.

228
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,589
- Oh.
- Yeah.

229
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,924
- Wanna hear something cool?
- Mm-hmm.

230
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,218
That field is where I fractured my pinkie

231
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,055
during the most ruthless game of dodgeball
in camp history.

232
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,682
Here's the kicker.
Guess who threw the winning ball?

233
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,851
Was it a hero with a broken pinkie?

234
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,269
You bet your ass.

235
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,648
And over there? That's where I asked
Michelle Keys to be my girlfriend

236
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,524
after we slow danced at the camp social.

237
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,568
Michelle Keys wasn't a big ambiance girl.

238
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,278
The shed was the spot.

239
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,615
Camp stud? I just... I did not know.

240
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,409
Did you ask a lot of girls
to be your girlfriend at camp?

241
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,455
Mm-hmm. Yeah. You had to leave camp
with a girlfriend. It was the whole point.

242
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,376
- Okay.
- [cell phone buzzing]

243
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,170
Hold on. It's Morgan. Hold on.

244
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,216
Hi. What do you need?
I'm flirting with a cute boy by a lake.

245
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:19,178
<i>Ashley just heard that an actual important
person is coming to the meeting tonight.</i>

246
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,346
<i>Malcolm Miller.</i>

247
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,306
He runs the entire podcast division, so...

248
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,224
- [Joanne] <i>What?</i>
- Yes.

249
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,576
- [Joanne] <i>He's coming now?</i>
- Yes.

250
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,394
Okay. That's okay. Uh...

251
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,355
<i>- You're great with powerful guys.</i>
- No. He's married.

252
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,773
- [Joanne] <i>Fuck! Okay.</i>
- Yeah.

253
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,358
Well, then I'm coming home.

254
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,068
No. No! Don't. Stay.

255
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,446
Morgan, you cannot handle
the entire podcast division by...

256
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,198
[Morgan] <i>Joanne? No, I'm doing this.</i>

257

<i>I need you to send me episode summaries
for potential live shows.</i>

258
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,830
Shit. I don't have my notes.
I left my computer at Noah's.

259
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,249
Sasha can let her into my place
so she can grab 'em.

260
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,709
- I'll text him.
- Okay.

261
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,420

Sasha can get you the notes.</i>

00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,298
Bye.

- [inhales]
- [call ends]

265
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,509
And she hung up.

266
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,178
She seemed confident.

267
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:06,183
Yeah. Yeah. She's...
She'll be... She is gonna be...

268
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:10,521
I need to go back to the cabin, write some
additional notes for her, just in case.

269
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,441
All right, how about this?
I'll go grab us two plates of food.

270
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,317
When you're done, we'll go on a picnic.

271
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,444
- A picnic?
- [Noah] Yeah.

272
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,113
I brought the perfect dress,
but only if we're backlit,

273
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,365
so stay to the west of me.

274
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,159
- I'm gonna wear this.
- [Joanne] Okay.

275
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,886
- See you then.
- [Joanne] Yeah.

276
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,413
[upbeat music playing]

277
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,625
[Morgan] Oh my God. Thank you. Oh my God.

278
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,378
I need this so bad.
It's been a nightmare.

279
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,379
[grunts] Here we go.

280
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,715
I got a guy who can wipe that in an hour.

281
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:41,385
What? No. I just need to get some stuff
off of it for a work meeting tonight.

282
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,597
Sorry. You just had a real manic energy,
so I was feeling perplexed...

283
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,224
Yeah, because my sister
is ditching our work dinner

284
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,018
to have sex with your stupid brother.

285
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,561
Now the big boss guy is coming.

286
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,457
I'm freaking out because I need
to show people that I can do this alone.

287
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,107
Oh, I get it.

288
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,695
- You're the loser sibling.
- What?

289
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,906
And no judgment. I'm the loser sibling.

290
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,658
It's hard to compete
when your brother's the Jewish Jesus.

291
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:05,742
Yeah.

292
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,496
Doesn't make as much sense with you.

293
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,206
- Hmm.
- You're cool as hell.

294
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,957
You have a witty comeback for everything.

295
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,544
You're like a smoke show. You got
this hot earth mother vibe going on.

296
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,796
- What?
- [Sasha] You know?

297
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,507
And you're way hotter than your sister.
She's too short.

298
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,550
Finally, somebody gets it, right?

299
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,634
- Oh!
- So short.

300
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,429
About this thing tonight,
a couple of years ago,

301
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,599
I met this hostage negotiator at a bar,
and he was telling me...

302
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,685
Wait. This isn't a hostage situation.
This is just a work dinner.

303
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,021
Everything in life is a hostage situation.

304
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,232
Okay.

305
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:40,110
Anyway, he was telling me about
this technique he used called "mirroring."

306
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,071
All you do, no matter what this guy says,

307
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,616
just repeat the last few words back to him
like it's smart and interesting,

308
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,784
and he'll keep talking.

309
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,907
It's gotten me
out of a lot of difficult situations.

310
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,248
"A lot of difficult situations"?

311
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,833
Mm-hmm. I've used it at home.

312
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,794
I've used it at work.
One time, I used it at a Dutch prison.

313
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,920
A Dutch prison?

314
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,130
Turns out
cocaine's still super illegal there.

315
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,132
Wait, cocaine is still
super illegal over there?

316
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,303
- Holy shit. You're so good at that.
- Thank you.

317
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,054
It was a great tip.

318
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,224
Thank you for the tip.
No, that doesn't work.

319
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,642
No, not as good.

320
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,977
[gentle music playing]

321
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,108
[Noah hums quietly]

322
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,195
Just the man I was looking for.

323
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,242
Rabbi Cohen, hi. I thought...
I thought that you had a donor meeting.

324
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,327
The Schlossbergs had a change of schedule,

325
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:36,125
so I just, uh, figured I would pop up
and watch the Torah study in action.

326
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,043
Yes, excellent!

327
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,546
I'm so glad
you're gonna be there in person.

328
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,840
Yeah, you're...
you're really loading up here.

329
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,759
Yeah. Yeah. It's all for me.

330
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:49,680
I get so hungry
before I do public speaking.

331
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:53,309
Oh, I get it.
Many activities make me hungry.

332
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,435
- [Noah laughs]
- Yeah.

333
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,854
Well, this food's not gonna eat itself,
so I'll just...

334
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,107
- [Rabbi Cohen] Okay. Be careful.
- Yep, steps.

335
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,902
- See you there!
- See you there.

336
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:03,861
Glad you're here.

337
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,697
[pensive music playing]

338
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,366
Oh, you gorgeous bitch. You did it again.

339
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,789
- Hi.
- [Joanne] Hello.

340
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,168
- I love it.
- Picnic outfit.

341
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:24,381
Yes. You know, I was thinking
we should just do a picnic inside instead.

342
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,885
Put some blankets down,
get a fire going, get cozy in here.

343
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,138
I don't know. I pictured it outside.
I really want the wind in my hair.

344
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,391
Yes, I get that, but a picnic inside
could be really good

345
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,685
'cause, think about it, more privacy.

346
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,395
- Okay.
- Less bugs.

347
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,857
Well, I don't like bugs,
and I do like privacy.

348
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,153
Mm, and then maybe after our privacy,
we can go sit out under the trees.

349
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,198
I gotta run over and do that Torah study,
and then we'll do it.

350
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,200
Oh, I know. I'm gonna be there.

351
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,243
I'm gonna be filming it, front row,

352
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,412
like an embarrassing aunt
with no kids of her own.

353
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,415
You know, I was thinking about that.
It's gonna be pretty boring.

354
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,001
You might wanna just hang here,
relax, read a book.

355
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,670
Oh no, I definitely wanna come.

356
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,964
It's gonna be boring.
You don't need to be there.

357
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,008
- You acting weird?
- I don't think so.

358
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,053
I feel like you're acting strange.

359
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,054
[sighs]

360
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,393
Okay, look. Uh...

361
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,477
[clears throat]

362
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,938
My boss just showed up unexpectedly,

363
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,567
and I... don't know if it's a good idea

364
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,446
for him to see me with you here.

365
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,157
Oh, are you serious?
Were you not supposed to bring a guest?

366
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,035
No, I can...
I can bring a guest. I just, um...

367
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,374
Look, I'm up for a big promotion,

368
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,627
and, um, he's a very traditional man.

369
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,463
And, um, he holds my future in his hands,

370
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,174
and, uh, if I'm being honest,
this has now...

371
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,344
It's become a weird situation for me.

372
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,180
Oh.

373
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,016
[poignant music playing]

374
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,142
Because of me?

375
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,561
Because I'm not Jewish?

376
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,270
I get it.

377
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,524
Well, thank you for being honest.

378
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,484
- Are you okay?
- Um... Mm-hmm.

379
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,361
Yep. I'm good.

380
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:16,035
[tuts] Yep. I... am dressed
for the outdoors, so I'm gonna...

381
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,620
I'm gonna still go.
I'm gonna just take both.

382
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,999
I'm gonna go outside and have,
you know, my own little picnic.

383
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:22,958
That's fine.

<i>Shabbat Shalom</i> to you too.

393

You should join us. We're making candles
for <i>Shabbat.</i> It's really fun.

394

And I think it'll help take your mind off
whatever your mind happens to be on.

I'm not...

396
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,959
I'm just... having
two adult servings of bread.

397
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,837
What is <i>Shabbat?</i>

398
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,007
Oh, uh, from sundown Friday
to sundown Saturday,

399
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,258
we take a day of rest,

400
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,887
and we hang out with our loved ones
and reflect on the week we just had.

401
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,680
- You're not allowed to work?
- Mm-mm.

402
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,599
You just sit
and chat with friends and family?

403
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,227
That sounds really nice.

404
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,854
It is. It's really nice
to connect with family

405
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,023
and talk shit
about the people that annoy you.

406
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,150
Oh! Now you're speaking my language.

407
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:34,029
I knew I was. Oh, I have to help Anna
with her candle. Excuse me.

408
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,952
So where's Hot Rabbi?

409
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,747
[sighs] Well, you girls were right.

410
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,833
Noah is trying to hide me.

411
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,543
Dead that you call him Noah!

412
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,046
He seemed so into me. And, I don't know...

413
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,131
Been there.

414
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,842
I guess it's official. I am a Shoshana.

415
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,428
- No offense, girl.
- It happens.

416
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,723
Honestly, you should leave him,
so that in five or six years,

417
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,227
he can reconnect with a former camper
he can spend the rest of his life with.

418
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,524
I feel like such an idiot.

419
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,610
I gave up a very important work thing
to be here with him.

420
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,822
When I'm older,
I don't wanna be sad like this.

421
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,700
Joanne is, like, 50,
and she's being a pick-me girl.

422
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,452
I wanna be empowered and confident
when I'm middle-aged.

423

I <i>am</i> confident, and I <i>am</i> empowered!
That's, like, my whole brand.

424
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,252
And that's what I should be
focusing on. Me.

425
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,424
Wow. You girls harshly judging me
actually helped.

426
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,593
- [upbeat music playing]
- And now I'm leaving.

427
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,262

[gentle music playing]

429
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,653
Hey, girls.

430
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,867
- Girls, have you seen Joanne?
- She left, Noah.

431
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,703
Uh, um, call me Rabbi Roklov.

432
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,663
So she left, huh?

433
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,457
Yeah. She realized how sus you are.

434
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,334
I'm not sus.

435
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,294
You treated Joanne like a slam-piece.

436
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,712
"Slam-piece"?

437
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,339
Are all guys medically stupid?

438
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,133
She wants to be your girlfriend, Noah,
not your friend.

439
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,594
I can't believe I ever loved you.

440

00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,774
- [music fades]
- [woman] Morgan!

444
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,235
So glad we can get this on the books.
Where's your sister?

445
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,029
- Who cares? You got the good one.
- [all laugh]

446
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,822
- Right!
- No, no. I'm just kidding.

447
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:45,118
Joanne is on some annoying adventure
that will eventually blow up

448
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,454
and make a great story
for our podcast, so...

449
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,581
- Amazing.
- [man] So great to finally meet.

450
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,376
I really love putting a face to the voice.

451
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,920
- Oh.
- Please just tell me about yourself.

452
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,089
I really like to get friendly
with the hosts.

453
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,383
It's probably because
I was born in Canada.

454
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,134
You were born in Canada?

455
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,595
- Yeah. Well, uh, born in Canada.
- Amazing.

456
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,349
But raised in Chicago, which you can
probably tell from my accent.

457
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,643
I... I can hear a slight accent.

458
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:13,355
A little bit there. Well, funny story
about my days in Chicago.

459
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,316
- I love Sammy Sosa.
- [all laughing]

460
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,652
This one's good.

461
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,529
- [Morgan] Thank you.
- [man] Oh!

[Shira] <i>How's your lady friend?</i>

463
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,242
She left. [sighs]

464
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,869
Oh. Well, that's a bummer.
She seemed great.

465
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,746
Yeah. Yeah. She is.

466
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,207
I sort of freaked out
when Rabbi Cohen showed up,

467
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,294
and, um, it didn't
go over so well with her.

468
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,170
- Mm. Got it.
- Yeah.

469
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,590
Think he'd still back me for head rabbi
if he knew I was with a <i>gentile?</i>

470
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,844
Hmm. I think
you're asking the wrong question.

471
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,763
How do you feel when you're with her?

472
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,725
Honestly, I have never felt like this
in my entire life.

473
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,059
[hopeful music playing]

474
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,769
But you know, it is

475
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,315
not without its significant complications.

476
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,068
Judaism has been around
for thousands of years, right?

477
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,739
And all but the last 50 of those,
women were not allowed to be rabbis.

478
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,075
But here I am, so suck it. [chuckles]

479
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,953
I mean, change is a process.

480
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,914
Maybe you change.
Maybe she does. Maybe you both do.

481
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,668
But that doesn't mean you give up
something great because it's difficult.

482
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:23,759
I cried every day for a year,
and then I was ready to move on.

483
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,137
- [Morgan] Mm.
- Oh, I've never told anyone that before.

484
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,222
- You're kidding?
- [man chuckles] No.

485
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:33,268
Wait. You guys get all the podcast guests
to feel that comfortable?

486
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,561
We try, but...

487
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:38,065
It's mostly Morgan.
People underestimate how good she is.

488
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,192
Oh, some people do.

489
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:44,654
Mm-hmm. Well, it's because you have
given people reasons to feel that way.

490
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,990
- [Morgan] Oh. Have I?
- Yeah, you have.

491
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,700
[Morgan] Okay. Let's hear about that.

492
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:53,372
And that is some of the sisterly magic
that happens when we're both here.

493
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,332
Wow. Wonderful.

494
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,918
And I think it would go really well
with our live shows.

495
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,045
Which is where
we would like the show to go.

496
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,046
[woman] Cheers to that.

497
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,214
What's happening?

498
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,840
- [hopeful music playing]
- Sweet.

499
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,551
Sorry. Will you excuse me
for just a second?

500
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,970
Okay. Oh, who's that?

501
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,306
Oh, that is Joanne's rabbi boyfriend.

502
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,475
Mm-mm. Just a friend.

503
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,186
But in my spare time,
I do consult on biblical matters.

504
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,269
[Morgan chuckles]

505
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,231
Sorry about that.

506
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,148
Is that true?

507
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,233
[music fades]

508
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,819
- What are you doing here?
- Ashley told me you'd be here.

509
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,445
Listen, I'm so sorry.

510
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,906
I know you... you pushed off work for me,

511
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,826
and then I literally hid you from my boss.

512
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,327
- Mm-hmm.
- I totally panicked.

513
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,287
I know how much
that must have hurt, okay?

514
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,374
But, Joanne, I don't wanna lose you, okay?

515
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,419
And I promise,
if you just give me a little time,

516
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,795
I will work that out.

517
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,171
It did hurt, Noah.

518
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,257
And also, you called me your friend

519
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,218
in front of the teens,
whose opinion I care about most.

520
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,301
That was so sus.

521
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,848
But maybe, most importantly,
you made me miss my first <i>Shabbat.</i>

522
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,643
- Your first <i>Shabbat?</i>
- Yes, Noah. It's Friday.

523
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,438
That is when <i>Shabbat</i> happens.
I learned about it at candle making.

524
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,066
I can fix this. Hang on. Just hang on.

525
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,152
[gentle music playing]

526
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,030
Can I have two glasses
of your house red, please? Thanks.

527
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,034
Hold that thought.

528
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,835
Someone forgot
their <i>Shabbat</i> candles at camp.

529
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,046
[music fades]

530
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,091
Now, did Shira tell you
why we light two candles on <i>Shabbat?</i>

531
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,217
No.

532
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,513
There's a few interpretations,
but I'll tell you my favorite.

533
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:37,934
The candles represent the two temples
in Jerusalem that were destroyed,

534
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,645
and we light them
to remind us that buildings can crumble,

535
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,105
but that doesn't matter.

536
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,150
What matters is gathering
with people we care about,

537
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,194
so <i>Shabbat</i> can happen anywhere.

538
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,820
It's kinda like a pop-up.

539
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,906
Yeah, it is.

540
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,991
So welcome to your first <i>Shabbat</i> dinner.

541
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,328
You wanna light the candles?
I'll say the prayers.

542
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,539
- [Joanne] Okay.
- [Noah] Here's an abridged version.

543
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,918

544

546
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,264
