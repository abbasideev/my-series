I know I played it very cool,

but deep down, I, in fact,
was a little bit nervous.

about you when you meet 'em on Saturday.

Whoa, whoa!
I'm meeting them this Saturday?

00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,171
Yeah, at my basketball game.

52

I thought that was
just a pick-up game with randos.

53
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,469
What? No, no, no. I'm in an actual league.

- Yep.

I didn't... No, sorry. I can't pretend
to know what you're talking about.

I tried. It felt false.

60
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:34,487
Okay. All you really need to know
is that my team is the Matzah Ballers.

61
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,865
- Theirs are the Huskies.
- Sorry, your name is what?

So good, right?

And while it's just a regular season game,
it does have huge playoff implications.

Right. Yes! This is huge, and I'm excited.

that say "Matzah Ballers" on it?

You referred to me as "Whore Number One."

171
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,216
Oh, okay. Um, right.
Was it Joanne, I wanna say?

172
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,134
Mm-hmm.

173
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,343
Oh, right, right.

174
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,054
You're the one
Noah brought around way too early.

175
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,184
Yep. Well, I just stopped by to say hi
and see if anyone... Want a whiskey?

176
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,478
We're good. We know where the bar is.
We're good.

177
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,729
- I'm good.
- Yeah, good.

178
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,523
- I'd take one.
- I think we're good.

179
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,733
Except I don't want one. So, no.

180
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,111
- Okay.
- We're good.

181
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,863
[exhales]

182
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,739
Do you come here a lot...

183
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,742
[Esther] I just remembered
I have to be somewhere.

184
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,035
Sasha, let's go!

185
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,328
Wait for us.

186
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,039
Oh, yeah. Okay.
I wasn't having a good time anyway.

187
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,291
- No.
- [woman] Let's go.

188
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,085
- Now.
- [Joanne] You guys as well?

189
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,004
Yep.

190
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,274
- Nice to meet you.
- [woman] Pick it up. Get your stuff.

191
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,549
But I wasn't...

192
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,343
- [woman] Yeah, don't give me attitude.
- [man] Okay, sure.

193
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,472
They all Rebecca's friends?

194
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,348
Yeah.

195
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:02,231
And now, they are absolutely
texting each other about me,

196
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,858
probably about my thin eyebrows,

197
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,110
but maybe they found
my other weaknesses too.

198
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,363
<i>I have something insane to tell you.
But also, what did you expect?</i>

199
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,157
<i>These women are friends with his ex.</i>

200
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,868
Yes, I'm aware. Perfect Rebecca.

201
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:17,121
Did you know she got more perfect?
Because she got a promotion at work.

202
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,039
What?

203
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,292
I've been keeping up with her LinkedIn.
I had to create a profile first.

204
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:25,922
But it says my job is
CEO of Fatigue Sisters Media.

205
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,382
Since you and I are always tired.
That's cute, right?

206
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,842
[Morgan] <i>Adorable. Okay, look.</i>

207
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,303
Am I sold on you ending up with a rabbi?

208
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,556
Absolutely not, okay? But I don't want you
to embarrass yourself.

209
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,266
Morgan, that's really sweet.

210
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,769
[Morgan] <i>Okay, because I am
eternally connected to you.</i>

211
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,939
Right? So you need to,
like, have a talk with Noah

212
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:46,442
and just come up with a plan
to rectify this situation, okay?

213
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,152
You're right. You're right.

214
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,114
Look at you using the word "rectify."
Good on you.

215
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,951
<i>Are you ready to hear
the insane thing I have to tell you?</i>

216
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:55,868
Oh, yes.

217
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:56,953
[Morgan] <i>Okay, so</i>

218
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,999
this is very weird
and, um, kind of confusing, but

219
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,795
I had a sex dream about the brother.

220
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,339
You had a sex dream about Sasha?

221
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,883
Yes! Yes, yes. It's gross, right?

222
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,261
<i>I don't get it.
I'm not even attracted to him.</i>

223
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,347
<i>You know, I'm just gonna hang up
because I regret telling you that.</i>

224
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,473
<i>So, um, bye!</i>

225
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,641
- Bye.
- [phone chimes]

226
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,309
[pensive music playing]

227
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,394
We should talk about

228
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,563
how Esther and her friends
blew me off tonight.

229
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,356
I know shouldn't care what people think,

230
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,276
at least that's what my therapist
on TikTok tells me,

231
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,986
but some people think

232
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,446
you shouldn't believe everything
you see on TikTok.

233
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,741
Noah!

234
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,327
- Hey!
- [Joanne sighs]

235
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,830
Sorry. I was just listening
to my hype mix.

236
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,541
Visualizing my corner threes
for the playoffs.

237
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,459
- [Noah exhales]
- Okay, um...

238
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,629
Are the WAGs gonna be at the playoffs?

239
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,590
Yeah, the playoffs are huge.

240
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,009
Yes, huge. We've established that. Um...

241
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,386
I don't think I should go.

242
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,972
- Joanne.
- Noah.

243
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,225
I know the women gave you a hard time,
but my guy friends loved you.

244
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:05,313
You know how if I hate someone,
you have to hate them too?

245
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,272
You hate them?

246
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,398
No. Not yet.

247
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,901
But if the wives hate me,
the husbands ha...

248
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,988
Have to hate you too.
Yeah, that's some tight logic.

249
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,867
If your friends hate me...
then your family's gonna hate me.

250
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,786
And, eventually, everyone's gonna hate me.

251
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,456
But you know what?
As a person who is universally liked,

252
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,916
I am not comfortable
in this scenario one bit.

253
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,044
Really worried about this?

254
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,172
It's the absolute largest problem
I've ever had in my life.

255
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,257
How are you not worried about it?

256
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,843
I mean, I like you a lot.

257
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,429
And I figure, eventually,
they'll all like you too.

258
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,972
They have to get to know you.

259
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,100
Mm-hmm. See, that's a solution
for someone who's patient.

260
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,352
I'm not a patient person.

261
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,480
I need to figure out
how to get them to like me by tomorrow.

262
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,563
[exhales]

263
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,233
I mean, it would be great
if Esther liked you.

264
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,985
- Yeah.
- [Noah] Uh...

265
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,030
Okay. I have an idea.

266
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,700
You do research for your podcast, right?

267
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,243
Yeah. A lot.

268
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,121
Well, Ashley does a lot,
and then I listen to the highlights.

269
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,248
Okay. Here are the highlights.

270
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,752
<i>- Okay. Talia loves to talk about herself.</i>
- [Joanne] <i>How original.</i>

271
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,047
[Noah] <i>She's getting married soon
and only wants to talk about her wedding.</i>

272
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,884
It is so hot in here.
But not like a good hot, like Aruba.

273
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,763
It is so weird that you said that.
I'm getting married in Aruba.

274
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,847
- No, you're not.
- I am.

275
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,140
- You're kidding.
- No.

276
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,143
That is the dream.
Would you show me your dress?

277
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,312
Oh, yeah. Oh my God. It's striped.

278
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:32,316
[Noah] <i>Rachel. She recently started
an inspirational line of, um, the, uh...</i>

279
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,944
<i>What do you call necklaces
that are really tight on your neck?</i>

280
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,862
[Joanne] <i>Chokers? Oh God.</i>

281
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,865
I'm so sorry.
Is that a Rachel Weinstein choker?

282
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,159
Oh my God. Y-Yeah, yes!

283
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,744
Uh, I... I'm Rachel Weinstein.

284
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,079
- No.
- Yes!

00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:48,082
[Noah] <i>Leah is still breastfeeding
and feels really judged about it,</i>

286
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,834
<i>so just be supportive.</i>

287
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,128
Gosh, pumping is so hard, right?

288
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,212
Yeah. [chuckles]

289
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,380
How old's your baby?

290
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:58,884
He's five. But he loves it so much,
and it comforts him...

291
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,010
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

292
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,471
Yeah, this is the best thing
in the world for him.

293
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,683
You're obviously a very good mom.

294

Rebecca's best friend, Esther.</i>

- Nice to see you again.
- Hi.

300
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,538
God. I have seen sixth grade teams
that could beat these guys.

301
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,708
Sasha's the tallest one on the court
and still can't make a shot.

302
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,960
That's the father of my child
you're talking about.

303
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:42,011
Don't tell her or anyone, but I think
this choker is giving me hives.

304
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,723
Like, I don't know what kind of
synthetic material it's made out of, but...

- Yeah.

307
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,063
Yeah, I really believe in it.

00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,147
That's cool.

309
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,570
You ever noticed that,

310
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,573

has ice in her veins, and I need help.

Um, I'm gonna drop a pin.

Uh, can you come?

323
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,407
Also, you are not allowed
to make fun of their jerseys

324
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,827
or how bad they are at basketball.
I'm serious.

Oh. Hi, boys.

330
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,471
Nice costumes. Hmm.

331
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,309
Oh, as if one of them wasn't enough.

00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,393
Oh.

- What's up?
- Oh, hi.

334
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,234
- I didn't know you were a basketball fan.
- I'm not. And this isn't helping.

335
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,570
- Why are you standing so close to me?
- I'm not.

336
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,922
- Yes, you are.
- [Esther] Sasha!

00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,382
Yeah. Yeah, no, we're friends.

508
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,885
Great. Well, thank you, friend,
for the ride home.

509
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,137
You're welcome.

510
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,557
- Two stars. Bye.
- Thank you.

511
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,184
That's gonna bring up
my star rating to two.

512
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,978
[pensive music playing]

513
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,776
- [Noah] That game was sad.
- [Joanne] Agree.

514
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,864
If that ball
took one little bounce differently,

515
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,033
goes in, we would win.

516
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,369
You were talking about the ball.
I was talking about the lack of snacks.

517
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,538
- Oh, the lack of snacks. Yes.
- Yeah.

518
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,708
Of course. That too. I love snacks.
Why don't I go downstairs?

519
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:19,713
I'll grab everything I have.
I think I got pickles, chocolate, cheese.

520
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,673
I think I got a few berries.

521
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:26,094
What do you say? We'll eat 'em in bed
while we watch the worst show we can find.

522
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,513
I really enjoy you as a human being, okay?

523
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,597
That's a yes.

524
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,772
Oh, hey, can I grab a sweatshirt?

525
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,066
[Noah] As long as the jersey
doesn't come off.

526
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,407
[tense music playing]

527
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,467
- [Noah] I got a bunch of weird stuff.
- [box lid shuts]

528
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:11,890
[exhales]

529
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,600
Uh, hope you like fusion.

530
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,270
You okay?

531
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,232
Yeah.

532
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,529
[poignant music playing]

533
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,501
[music fades]
