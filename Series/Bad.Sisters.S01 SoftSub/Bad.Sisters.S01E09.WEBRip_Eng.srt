1
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,652
This is to tie it up.

2
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,987
Oh, no! And what happened there?

3
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,243
It's weird she hasn't called.

4
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,747
You'd call us if Donal
didn't come home one night, right?

5
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,123
Don't know. Would I?

6
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,920
She'll probably call the police first,
right?

7
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,800
Are you not talking to me?

8
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,178
I am talking to you. I'm still processing.

9
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,722
You shouldn't have let her go rogue.

10
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,933
Now she's got to
carry that burden of guilt.

11
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,203
You weren't concerned about me
when I was going to shoot him.

12
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,353
Or me.

13
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,938
Well, she's younger than…

14
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:05,732
She's practically a kid.

15
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,902
She's 29.
What's the cutoff age for killing a man?

16
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,779
Anyway, we're not a firing squad.

17
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,199
We always knew one of us
would get the final bullet.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,285
Nice.

19
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,287
Becka.

20
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,581
Wait. Wait. Becka, wait!

21
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,835
- I can't breathe.
- There must've been tools in there!

22
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,188
- Was there tools in there?
- There's no tools. We checked!

23
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,506
- What happened?
- He's unkillable. He's like a cockroach.

24
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,924
Someone was in that room!

25
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,052
What if it was Minna?

26
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,471
What am I missing?

27
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,450
Birthday planning!
Get back in there, you big eavesdropper.

28
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,684
Get in.

29
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,935
- Get in!
- Sorry!

30
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,521
I have to go over there.

31
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,524
- No, wait, wait, wait. What do...
- Why is he here? He never comes.

32
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,327
It doesn't matter.
It's good that he's here.

33
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,862
We'll keep him here
while you check on Minna, okay?

34
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,156
Okay, look, walk! Don't run.
We're gonna say you're sick.

35
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,825
I actually do feel sick.

36
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,201
What?

37
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,661
Right, kids, dinner!

38
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,871
Coming now!

39
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,141
So, Blanaid, did your daddy threaten
to cancel your pocket money?

40
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,166
Is that what happened?

41
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,043
Fat chance.

42
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:36,049
Road rage incident. Very angry chap.
Um, got his license number though.

43
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,511
Um, JP, why don't you take a seat?

44
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:43,807
Uh, no, I'm not staying.
Um, I'm headed over to my mum's.

45
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,435
No. What? What... Stay.

46
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,770
You can, uh, have, uh... have Becka's seat.

47
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,147
Oh, yeah.

48
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,982
That's a great idea, JP. Stay.

49
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,692
No. I just wanted to drop the girls off.

50
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,612
I need to bring Mum her shopping.
Should've done it last night.

51
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,792
Minna!

52
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,338
Minna, it's me!

53
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,464
Minna!

54
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,624
You called Becka.
Leave a message, you weirdo.

55
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,086
Becka, he's going round there,
so just... please...

56
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,631
Just listen to this bloody message!

57
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,134
Hey!

58
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,719
Will we serve up dessert?

59
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,472
Absolutely. Yeah, get stuck in.

60
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,269
Everyone's a bit weird today.

61
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,603
Are they?

62
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:15,190
I don't know why.

63
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,359
Oh, my God.

64
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,662
- Mama! Where are you?
- Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

65
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,207
Where are you?
I've got some groceries for you.

66
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:36,086
Got some, uh... Argh! Ooh, soggy. Um…

67
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,965
Looks like you'll be eating fish fingers
for a few days.

68
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,425
Mama!

69
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:49,892
Mama!

70
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,310
Shit, shit.

71
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,519
Mama!

72
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:53,729
Where are you?

73
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,709
Mama!

74
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,876
But Mama, what are you doing?

75
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,383
What are you doing, Mama?

76
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,851
Oh, you're so cold!

77
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,942
Oh. Hi. I thought I'd check in on Min.

78
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,985
I thought you were sick.

79
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,737
Sick of my sisters.

80
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,781
- Felt like a Minna day.
- Mmm.

81
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,369
She's, um... She's sleeping.

82
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,745
- I'll come in and wait.
- No.

83
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,456
Don't like you hanging around here,
giving her ideas.

84
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,124
Go away.

85
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,476
Ah, fuck!

86
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,288
Oh, Becka. Thank Christ!

87
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,706
He said she's sleeping.

88
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,541
What, you talked to him?

89
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,344
- I need to know.
- What did you say to him?

90
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,628
Nothing.
I just said I fancied a Minna day.

91
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,172
I have to get in that house.

92
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,340
Look. I know this is awful, not knowing,

93
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,218
but forcing your way in there
is only going to make things worse.

94
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,303
She's right.

95
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,598
We just need to act like normal, okay?
Wait it out.

96
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,409
Go in and lie down.
I'll get you a plate of food.

97
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,433
I can't eat.

98
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,811
Well,
then I will bring you a box of wine, okay?

99
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:04,813
- Just go and lie down.
- I can't lie down.

100
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,191
Well, just pace about then,
but do it here.

101
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,234
Not outside Minna's.

102
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,365
- If Minna's in there...
- I can't even think about that.

103
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:19,828
- I'm saying he might suspect...
- No. No, it looked like an accident.

104
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,664
If she is in there,

105
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,459
then he's the one with the problem.

106
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:05,624
What the…

107
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,107
What service do you require?

108
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,736
I just found my mother
unresponsive in bed.

109
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:42,286
I think she may have...
Have died in her sleep last night.

110
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,496
When was she last conscious? Do you know?

111
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,626
Hello? Excuse me, sir,
are you still there?

112
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,474
Answer it.

113
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,854
Hey, honey.

114
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,815
I'm just here with all the girls.
You all right?

115
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:17,279
I'm glad you're together.
I... I didn't want Becka to be on her own.

116
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,741
Becka, Minna's dead.

117
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,784
No. Grace.

118
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:25,120
She passed away last night in her sleep.

119
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:27,998
- In her sleep?
- I'm so sorry.

120
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,751
If there's anything we can do, just...

121
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:34,171
John Paul needs me now. Talk later, okay?

122
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,799
Okay, honey. We love you.

123
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,386
Oh, Becka.

124
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,931
What have I done?

125
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:47,017
Listen. Listen to me!
None of this would have happened

126
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,062
if the prick hadn't have
locked his dead dad in a fucking freezer!

127
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:53,524
She must have known George was in there.
She must have gone to see him.

128
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:57,402
- I know. Yeah. Yeah.
- Or maybe she actually died in bed.

129
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:01,907
Christ's sake. He's covering his tracks!

130
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,577
No, he can't.
He can't get away with this too.

131
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,681
I mean, if he's gonna lie about Minna,
then I'll tell the truth about George.

132
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,250
I'll take him down even...
Even if I go down too.

133
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,127
No. No, because if you go down,
we all go down.

134
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,629
Shut up, Ursula!

135
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,881
We need to get in there
before he moves his body.

136
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:21,176
- And... And do what?
- I... I don't know! Photograph it!

137
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,429
- And... And then what?
- We can't go to the police.

138
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,014
You do get that, don't you, Becka?

139
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:27,307
I don't want to hear her.

140
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,309
Just, please.

141
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,981
Okay. Better we have a photograph
than no photograph.

142
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,858
- No.
- Just so we have something

143
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,651
to use against him if we need it.

144
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,861
No, it's too risky.

145
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,321
Well, I'm going over there
with or without you lot.

146
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,866
No, I'll... I'll come with you. Okay?

147
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,540
What the hell? Where is he?

148
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:54,918
I can't believe this is happening.

149
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:58,839
Becka.

150
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,551
I need to get out of here.

151
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:03,635
Okay.

152
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,274
Oh, shit.

153
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,110
What are you doing here?

154
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,154
- We were just...
- I wanted to see the...

155
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,530
See what?

156
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:26,950
We were just... Becka thought she left some
massage equipment here, so we...

157
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,244
What? In the freezer room?

158
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:35,125
We didn't go into any freezer room.
We... We were just going. Sorry.

159
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,005
Becka, I know you were here last night.

160
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,636
You pierced her nose.

161
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,888
I took it out
'cause it made her look cheap.

162
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,642
Sorry for your loss.

163
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:06,740
He knows. He bloody knows.

164
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,450
What else would we be doing down there?

165
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,203
- He knows we know about George.
- I don't care if he knows.

166
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,121
I care that Minna is dead.

167
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:15,123
- I-I care that I did it.
- Yeah, we did it.

168
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,376
You didn't even know about it.

169
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,712
I started this. We are all guilty.

170
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,633
- Oh, shit. Does he know that?
- I mean, does he know that we...

171
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,093
Stop talking about him.

172
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,972
My heart is gonna break, Eva.

173
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:35,102
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

174
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,356
Sorry, Becka.

175
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:42,734
Becka. B…

176
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:46,572
Becka!

177
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,689
You totally went off radar.

178
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,401
You didn't tell me you dug up JP's body.

179
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:10,948
So tell me the truth because,
um, my brother is losing his mind.

180
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,576
Funny enough, Matt,
I don't care about your brother.

181
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,619
I care about my sister.

182
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,789
You're not paying her
what she's due. Why's that?

183
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:22,501
You were at the marina
the night JP took a dip.

184
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,502
Gabriel saw you with Eva.

185
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:28,006
Yeah, we were out driving or messing.
I was pissed.

186
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,510
I made Eva take me to Gabriel's boat.
I thought we could have a drink on board.

187
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,470
So, you didn't see JP's car?

188
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:36,056
We didn't notice any cars.
We were looking at the boats.

189
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,141
Why are you asking?

190
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,811
And this bullshit friendship with Minna.
What was that about?

191
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,021
It wasn't a bullshit friendship.

192
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:49,820
I saw the check she made out to you,
Becka.

193
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,363
The antique check?

194
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,117
Did you notice it wasn't cashed?

195
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,554
You wouldn't understand anything
about that

196
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:59,859
because all you and your brother
can think about is money.

197
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,083
Coming from the woman who was happy
to take a handout from a man she hated.

198
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,001
That's not what...

199
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,521
Oh, was it a coincidence
she died a few weeks before John Paul...

200
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:09,923
- Yes, it was a fucking coincidence!
- Oh, you're a hypocrite, Becka!

201
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,341
And you use people.

202
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,945
You saw Minna and took an opportunity.
You're doing the same with me.

203
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:16,847
You're the hypocrite!
You pretended to like me.

204
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:21,685
- Minna was my friend, and I miss her!
- Stop, Becka.

205
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,938
- I miss her!
- Stop.

206
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:27,941
I'm sorry.

207
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:34,405
I'm sorry.

208
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:19,451
Hey. Is everything okay?

209
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,161
Yeah.

210
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:24,873
Where are you?

211
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:28,627
You're with her.

212
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:34,049
- Yeah.
- You're a fool. She's lying to you.

213
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:37,386
They killed him in Wicklow.
I can't prove it, but I know they did it.

214
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,732
Someone want a little cuddle?

215
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,921
Tom? Tom?

216
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,636
You have to pay out? Is that what this is?

217
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:26,185
Uh, okay, so… we're bankrupt.

218
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:28,854
Well, at least it's done. Over.

219
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,230
I've been trying so hard.

220
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:32,232
I-I don't care.

221
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:36,278
I care about you and having this baby.

222
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:38,488
Look, come here.

223
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,576
We can live in a box out the back
of a Harvey Norman.

224
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,245
I don't give a shit
as long as I have you both.

225
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,629
Matt's in love with the Garvey girl.

226
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,214
Well, I told you that.

227
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,592
I'd like a face-to-face
with those Garveys.

228
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,553
What is she like?

229
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:04,556
Aside from being an accomplice to murder?

230
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,683
I don't know. Fit?

231
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:13,232
There's something else, isn't there?

232
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:25,494
If we can't pay the Williams claim,
there will be an investigation.

233
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,288
- Right. And?
- And…

234
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,959
well, they'll find a mess.

235
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,129
- What kind of mess?
- A fraudulent mess.

236
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:42,678
The Williams case was never processed.
There was no cover.

237
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:46,974
Dad just took the monthly payments,
and he spent them.

238
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:48,892
If there's an investigation,

239
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:51,645
they'll find that
and all the other policies

240
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,772
that weren't worth the paper
they were written on.

241
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:57,693
He embezzled his clients for years,
and I've helped to cover it up.

242
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:01,405
Are you talking jail time, Thomas?

243
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:19,006
- Sorry for your loss.
- Don't bring him on us, Eva.

244
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:25,053
Come here.

245
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:27,306
Poor little thing.

246
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,898
Urs isn't coming.

247
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:38,066
Why? It's so much fun.

248
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:41,904
Minna would've hated this.

249
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,450
She deserved a proper send-off.

250
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:49,203
Yeah. A dry funeral.

251
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,456
She was always half-pissed
every time I saw her.

252
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,041
She had dementia, Bibi.

253
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,293
No, I mean on top of that.

254
00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:01,840
This was her favorite.
I'll drink to her if no one else will.

255
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,550
That's not gonna help, honey.

256
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:07,095
That is rich coming from you.

257
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,185
I need a breather from her.

258
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:15,604
Make sure she doesn't do anything stupid.

259
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,580
- What happened?
- Doesn't matter.

260
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:36,500
He's calling it a road rage incident.

261
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,835
I had a word with him.

262
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,878
- What did you say?
- I told him to stay away.

263
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:41,562
- And then you hit him?
- Yes, I hit him.

264
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,173
Christ's sake, Ben.

265
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,551
Why did you have to fan the flame?

266
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:49,429
Did anyone see you?

267
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,099
What do you expect me to do?

268
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:55,561
After what he did to you,
the scumbag should be in jail.

269
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:01,567
Show me your hand.

270
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:15,163
You did that for me?

271
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:26,758
I'd do anything for you, Urs.

272
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,442
People keep saying it was her time.

273
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,737
Well, she had a long life.

274
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,572
But she wasn't ready to die.

275
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:52,659
I think your mother died the day
you told her that George had left her.

276
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:55,037
All she did was find her way back to him.

277
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:57,080
Hey.

278
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:59,124
Hey. You okay?

279
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,335
I'm grand, really.
I'm just worried about this man.

280
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:02,252
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

281
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:03,754
Let's get away, Mammy.

282
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:07,883
Go up to the cabin for your birthday.
Dust off the quad bike.

283
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:10,177
Well, she hates quad biking.

284
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,931
And she's gonna be spending her birthday
with her sisters like she always does.

285
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,266
She's my wife, and she spends it with me.

286
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,519
Cabin's not ready. It's a building site.

287
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:20,437
Just needs a woman's touch, really.

288
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:23,148
Well, how about you lot
join us the next morning,

289
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:25,400
and we could have a half day
at the hotel spa?

290
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:28,445
Oh, my God. Do you remember my 35th?

291
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:31,657
We all got drunk at the bar
and then went back to the cabin.

292
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,409
We're not doing a rerun
of that car crash of a night.

293
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:37,746
No drunken stragglers this time.

294
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,332
I'm fine. I'll see you later.

295
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,043
Eva.

296
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:46,088
Oh, um, she's upset.

297
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:49,758
- Um, I'll call you. I love you.
- Oh, okay. I love you. Yeah, do.

298
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:50,676
Becka!

299
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,135
You all right, Pebble?

300
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,931
Mmm, yeah, we're okay.
I'm worried about John Paul and…

301
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:58,100
Grace.

302
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,200
Oscar.

303
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:28,130
We are restructuring, Eva.

304
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:32,676
Where formerly, staff came to you
to sign off on client accounts,

305
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,678
they will now come to me.

306
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:37,514
And that includes you.

307
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:41,268
And you agree to this?

308
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:44,646
JP says there have been
some errors of late, um...

309
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,941
- What, and you believe him?
- Yes, I believe him, Eva.

310
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:51,612
You've been distracted recently.
Not yourself at all, if I'm honest.

311
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:55,199
And there's been complaints.

312
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:57,910
There's been complaints?
Well, what exactly...

313
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:02,247
From clients, um,
about the smell of drink off you.

314
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:06,960
And not just your breath.
You're sweating alcohol, it seems…

315
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:10,631
which says something.

316
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:20,891
Eva. Eva.

317
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:47,167
Grace will be upset by this,

318
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,628
so I hope we can keep it civil
for her sake.

319
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:53,549
Because, Eva, I'm not going anywhere.

320
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:57,719
I know Becka was there
the night that Minna died,

321
00:27:57,803 --> 00:27:59,930
and I wondered,
"Why would she want to hurt Minna?"

322
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,014
But there's no answer.

323
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:04,059
And then I had this strange memory
of seeing her in my bedroom

324
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:05,853
the night I fell into the marina.

325
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:09,565
And I thought, "Ah, come on.
Don't be stupid. How could that be?"

326
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:13,402
But here she is again, one more time,
in a place where she shouldn't be.

327
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:17,364
And then,
I remembered something else this morning.

328
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:22,494
I remembered
the Garvey girls are like rats.

329
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,207
Where there's one, there's more,
which is why you need to poison the nest.

330
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,087
Get away from my car,
or I will mow you down like roadkill.

331
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:34,756
Okay, sure. No problem. Please.

332
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:54,860
- Emergency. Which service?
- Jesus, that was quick.

333
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:58,488
It's okay. You're here.

334
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:07,289
Yeah, no. Okay. No. We're
not doing that. No, no. Okay, we got it.

335
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,791
Kept him in the freezer for years.

336
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:12,794
Jesus Christ. That's why she...

337
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:13,879
Sorry!

338
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:16,632
Thank you!

339
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,968
I didn't believe her about George, Eva.

340
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:21,178
Okay.

341
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:23,430
God. Her um...

342
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:26,266
Her friend died recently, so she's...

343
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,311
She's been sick,
so should be the worst of it over.

344
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:31,563
- Okay.
- It was all over the grave though,

345
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:33,857
so you might want to call Father Doyle
in the morning.

346
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:36,151
Offer to sluice it out or…

347
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:39,279
Father D... Yeah. No, I will.
I-I'll do that. Yeah.

348
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:43,158
They're not listening to me!
Tell them I killed Minna.

349
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:44,868
I'll kill you in a second.

350
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:47,552
Hey, do you know, if you have
any Dioralyte at home, that'll help.

351
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:49,581
Brilliant idea. Thank you.

352
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:51,792
Nice house!

353
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,293
Thank you.

354
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:56,421
Tell them!

355
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:57,631
Please shut up.

356
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:02,261
Oh, my God.
I can't believe she spoke to the police.

357
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:05,806
- Just calm down. It was two local morons.
- She's a liability.

358
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:08,600
I told you this is what would happen
if you involved her, didn't I?

359
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:10,519
I am fucking here, you know.

360
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,896
Look, I know this is hard,

361
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,484
okay, but you are just gonna
have to find a way to carry it.

362
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:19,236
That's easy for you to say.

363
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:22,114
He didn't take your eye or blackmail you.

364
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:24,449
Put blood on your hands.

365
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:32,708
Sorry. I know what he did to you.

366
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,628
Gabriel and your work.

367
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:43,343
That euthanasia drug
that you were telling us about.

368
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:45,572
- Can you get that at the hospital?
- What the hell, Eva?

369
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:50,058
No, I'm gonna finish this.
I'm gonna do it this weekend in Wicklow.

370
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:51,768
No. No.

371
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:54,396
We are going there
to give Grace a decent birthday.

372
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:57,274
What he said to me at work,
that was a threat.

373
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:59,610
He is onto us now.

374
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:01,653
- He's onto us?
- Well, what exactly does he know?

375
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:04,406
- It's what he suspects.
- Which is what?

376
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:06,783
That Becka had something
to do with Minna's death,

377
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:09,161
- or that we're trying to kill him?
- I don't know.

378
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:10,287
All of it.

379
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:13,290
Can you get it?

380
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:16,043
Pentobarbital? Not from work, no.

381
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:21,757
- I know a dodgy vet. I could ask him.
- Oh, my...

382
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:25,427
It's too dangerous to rush into it like
this. You're being completely reckless.

383
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:27,763
You're the one who wanted him dead
in the first place.

384
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:29,014
I could do it.

385
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:31,058
I've got blood on my hands anyway.

386
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:33,477
Might as well be hung for a sheep.

387
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,728
No one's getting hung.

388
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:36,855
This is mine.

389
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:39,816
I can do this. I know I can.

390
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,943
Is that a fact?

391
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:44,655
'Cause right now, I think you are more
of a liability than she is.

392
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:46,782
We are not doing it.

393
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:56,667
Get the stuff.

394
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:06,218
I'll be back in an hour.

395
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:08,679
Don't look so worried.
I won't tell him anything.

396
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:11,181
I just want to suss out the legalities.

397
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:14,935
No point in having a solicitor for a pal
if you don't use them, right?

398
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,520
You don't have pals.

399
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:18,522
That's true.

400
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:20,399
I love you, Thomas.

401
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:23,986
I know.

402
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:47,551
Okay.

403
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:33,472
No.

404
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:45,567
Gotcha, Becka Garvey.

405
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,550
Forgot me bloody wallet.

406
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,053
Figured I'd have to buy him a drink
at least or-or something.

407
00:34:14,263 --> 00:34:15,347
Theresa.

408
00:34:16,974 --> 00:34:20,893
Theresa! Theresa!
Theresa, you okay? Can you hear me?

409
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:24,857
Fuck!
You're all right. You're all right.

410
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,525
- What service do you require?
- Hello? I need an ambulance!

411
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:32,447
Thomas? Thomas!

412
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:34,699
I felt a bit weird
picking out knickers for Theresa,

413
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:38,036
- but I just closed my eyes.
- I haven't time for this shit.

414
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,415
Hey. Hey, wait. Thomas. What's going on?

415
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:43,792
- She had a seizure.
- What?

416
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:48,463
I just had some 23-year-old
with the emotional depth of a Chihuahua

417
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:49,547
lay it out for me.

418
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,342
I could lose her. I could lose my baby.
I could lose them both.

419
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:54,803
No, it won't...
You won't lose them, Thomas.

420
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:57,848
She was going to see Becka Garvey.
Did you know that?

421
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:01,685
That's what she was doing
before she collapsed.

422
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,228
This is my fault.

423
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:05,189
I dumped all this shite
at the end of her bed.

424
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:07,482
Expected her to, what,

425
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:10,068
just watch us two running around
like headless chickens?

426
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:14,323
I don't think I can cope
if things go wrong in there.

427
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:16,450
Things will not go wrong in there,
all right?

428
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:20,204
And I've got the mess out here.
Okay? I have it.

429
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:22,581
Thomas.

430
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:31,507
Hey, I miss you. Where'd you go?

431
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:34,343
Am I not worth investigating anymore?

432
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:27,980
Hey. I don't know if you remember me.
I was in last week.

433
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:30,774
Ah, you think I could forget that face?

434
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:33,777
Yeah.
I know. Um, listen, I showed you a photo...

435
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:35,195
You having a drink?

436
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:37,531
Uh, no, no. I'm okay. I'm just, um…

437
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:43,328
Yeah, I-I'll have a pint of,
uh, what's that, lager?

438
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:45,289
And, uh, whatever you're having.

439
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:53,463
So, I asked if this lad was in
watching the match on the Friday.

440
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:55,799
Yeah, I think so.

441
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:59,761
Hang on. You said you were certain before.

442
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:01,096
Did I?

443
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,892
Yeah, no. Yeah, you definitely did
'cause I-I took notes.

444
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,394
Probably. Look, I don't know.

445
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:11,690
- I don't have a photograph memory.
- Uh, okay.

446
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:17,070
Um, so, can I ask if you saw
any of these ladies on the Friday?

447
00:37:18,197 --> 00:37:21,950
Now, this one,
she was in on the Friday definitely.

448
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:25,954
Drank double whiskeys.
Didn't buy any herself, might I add.

449
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:37,466
Oh, come on.

450
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:38,884
- Matt?
- Tom? Tom?

451
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:40,469
- I can't talk, Matt.
- I have proof

452
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:42,638
- that the sisters were lying.
- What?

453
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:44,389
They weren't all together that night.

454
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:47,559
The night Williams died?
I fucking knew it.

455
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:43,574
The next couple of days
are just about Grace, all right?

456
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:47,953
Nobody tries anything,
nobody goes it alone. Okay?

457
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:51,164
No plans to. I need a drink.

458
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,890
Makes me feel alive!

459
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:12,102
I feel sick!

460
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:14,021
Here we go!

461
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:16,315
JP?

462
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:19,860
Hold on tight, Mammy!

463
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:30,078
Careful. Careful!

464
00:39:57,439 --> 00:39:58,440
I've got this.

465
00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:12,871
I know you were Oscar.

466
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:15,517
And I know you got me in trouble
with the police.

467
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:18,627
- Um, Roger...
- No. I don't want to hear lies.

468
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,630
I came here to ask you a question.

469
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:23,257
Ask away.

470
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:26,134
Why did you do it?

471
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:29,054
You were my friend.

472
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:35,936
Well, perhaps because I didn't like you
sniffing around my family,

473
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:38,981
because we are not friends.

474
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:41,817
And we never were.

475
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,945
You're just a sad old man
from across the street

476
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:47,239
that we tolerate
because we're nice people.

477
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:51,869
And because you probably would fiddle
with kids if you could, wouldn't you?

478
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:55,706
- Do you know I prayed for you?
- Hmm.

479
00:40:58,417 --> 00:40:59,418
And I forgive you.

480
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:08,051
Um, people like you, Roger,
don't get to forgive people like me.

481
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:11,680
Forgiveness flows down.

482
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:13,765
Remember that.

483
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:25,485
Who was that, hon?

484
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:31,742
Uh, just some religious nut
lecturing me on forgiveness.

485
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:32,826
Oh.

486
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:53,597
Come on. Come on!

487
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:01,313
Have any of you heard from Eva?
She's not answering me.

488
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:05,692
I don't know where she is,
but she's got our room key.

489
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:09,780
We need to get hammered. Like, medically.

490
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:13,617
- Three double whiskeys?
- Actually, make it two.

491
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,700
What? Why?

492
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:17,329
Ben is staying nearby.

493
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:20,791
It's my last night with him.

494
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:22,626
Does he know that?

495
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:25,295
Not yet.

496
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:29,341
Anyway, I'll be back bright and early
to take us all to Grace's.

497
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:34,930
Don't believe any of that
"last night together" crap.

498
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:37,099
The horny bitch.

499
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:38,892
Pub?

500
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:41,770
No. I think I'm just gonna hit the sack.

501
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:43,564
Would you text me when Eva gets back?

502
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:46,525
You know Ursula got the pento?

503
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:48,443
What?

504
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:52,698
Eva wouldn't do anything
without telling us.

505
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,743
What, you think she's gonna do it?

506
00:42:57,578 --> 00:42:59,079
I think she thinks she's gonna.

507
00:42:59,162 --> 00:43:00,247
What does that mean?

508
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:03,876
Becka?

509
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:05,836
Becka!

510
00:43:14,178 --> 00:43:17,181
I was just thinking how nice it is
when it's just the two of us.

511
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:24,897
Do you really have to go
and see your sisters tomorrow?

512
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,316
Oh, JP, it's too late to cancel now.

513
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:29,776
And I'll be back by lunch.

514
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:33,572
Your sisters never really liked me,
did they?

515
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:44,708
But do you know how much it hurts

516
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,836
when I feel that you love them
more than me?

517
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:50,422
But that's not true.

518
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,512
Good.

519
00:43:57,638 --> 00:43:59,264
To "just us."

520
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:01,183
Just us.

521
00:44:21,703 --> 00:44:22,788
Becka?

522
00:44:55,153 --> 00:44:56,864
I wish he'd leave us alone.

523
00:44:58,824 --> 00:45:02,077
Without him,
we could go back to the way we were.

524
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:39,531
Oi.

525
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:42,910
Where did you go last night?

526
00:45:44,244 --> 00:45:47,039
Pub.

527
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:52,503
Very muddy pub.

528
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:56,590
Jesus.

529
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:00,177
What is wrong with you?

530
00:46:07,851 --> 00:46:09,061
Just checking you're here.

531
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:11,104
Where else would I be?

532
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:24,952
Ben?

533
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:35,212
Shit!

534
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:38,924
No. No, no, no, no.

535
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:53,730
Think I should call Urs?

536
00:46:54,314 --> 00:46:57,526
Why?
She's barely phoning it in these days.

537
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,324
What's wrong?

538
00:47:04,408 --> 00:47:05,784
I don't wanna go in.

539
00:47:05,868 --> 00:47:09,705
Um, just call Grace and-and get her
to meet us at the end of the road.

540
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:11,456
No, I will not.

541
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,209
Just put your party hats on and be normal.

542
00:47:26,054 --> 00:47:29,224
Put your party hat on. Please.

543
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:30,934
Please!

544
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:34,730
Ow.

545
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:37,274
And your party face.

546
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:42,821
That's better.

547
00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:45,657
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck?

548
00:47:45,741 --> 00:47:48,368
- Grace!
- Grace!

549
00:47:51,872 --> 00:47:53,582
Wha... What?

550
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:55,792
What?

551
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:58,587
John Paul is dead.
He's dead, Eva. He's dead.
