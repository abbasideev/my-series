1
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,835
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,732
Oh, my God.

3
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,008
Oh, no.

4
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,013
God, that's vile.

5
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,892
My lady, it's nearly time to go.

6
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,610
What's going on in there?

7
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,906
I think I'm gonna stay in the bath.

8
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,035
You and Ruben go. Make a day of it.

9
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,663
He was your brother-in-law, Bibi.

10
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,957
She's your sister.

11
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,167
She needs you.

12
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,545
She doesn't.

13
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,421
Not anymore.

14
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,721
- Michael, no.
- No.

15
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,098
Ursula, you in there?

16
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,351
Michael won't take off his GAA jersey!

17
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,478
- I don't want to.
- Okay, coming.

18
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,820
Urs! Molly, we're leaving now, all right?

19
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,408
At least you've got your smart shoes on.

20
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,937
Hey.

21
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,734
Oh, monkey.

22
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:56,904
What's up?

23
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,238
Mum won't stop crying.

24
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,450
Well, that's, you know, that's to be…

25
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,118
But how are you?

26
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:04,620
I don't know.

27
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,956
I keep forgetting he's dead. Is that bad?

28
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,334
No.
That used to happen to me all the time.

29
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,670
I'm going to tell my friends
he died in his sleep.

30
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,088
Okay.

31
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,798
All right. Well, that's a nice idea.

32
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,384
No one RSVP's to a funeral.

33
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,304
How are you supposed to know
how much food to make?

34
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,772
I couldn't bear the thought
of him being all alone.

35
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,398
Yeah. No, of course.

36
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,025
Took a bit of getting used to.

37
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,611
But it's been nice having him here.

38
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,737
Hasn't it, Blanaid?

39
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,157
He looks like he's wearing makeup.

40
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:44,993
Well, he is wearing makeup.

41
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,539
Maybe turn the heating down a bit,
you know. Just in case.

42
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,087
Why have you got, I mean, why have you p...

43
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,171
Did you see him?

44
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,383
She has him dressed in pajamas.

45
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,968
Pajamas? Why?

46
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,804
She wants to make eternal damnation
all comfy for him.

47
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,306
He had a hard-on.

48
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,935
Last two fingers up to Grace.

49
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,228
The dead prick.

50
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,982
Postmortem priapism isn't uncommon
after a violent death.

51
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,529
Thank you, nurse. That will be all.

52
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,159
Where the hell's Becka?

53
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,316
Oh, my God.

54
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:29,116
Oh, Jesus.

55
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,243
Sorry, I think that was my fault.

56
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,953
- You... What are you doing?
- Sorry.

57
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,496
You walked right out in front of me.

58
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,665
What, did you wanna get hit?

59
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,376
No, I was just... I'm

60
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,337
- I'm late for a...
- God. My leg is banjaxed.

61
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,964
These are yours.

62
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,174
Oh, shite.

63
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,509
Was it cracked before, or…

64
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,513
- Sorry.
- Are you kidding?

65
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,056
I don't know where my head was.

66
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,601
Okay, there's another.

67
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,478
Is this your sandwich?

68
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,230
Yeah.

69
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,608
I think there's some gravel in it.

70
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,443
What? Oh, no.

71
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:23,962
Mind yourself.

72
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,088
What?

73
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:26,965
Shit!

74
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,133
Oh, shit.

75
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:34,765
Shit.

76
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:40,479
We offer our prayers today
for John Paul Williams

77
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,774
and his adored wife, Grace,
and daughter, Blanaid.

78
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,901
- Along with his sisters-in-law…
- Hey.

79
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:50,739
…Eva, Ursula, Bibi and Becka Garvey.

80
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,157
- Lord, hear us.
- Becka. Come on.

81
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,117
- Lord, graciously hear us.
- Sorry.

82
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,453
We remember
our brothers and sisters in Christ

83
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,580
who are no longer with us today,

84
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:03,210
especially Grace Williams' parents,
Bill and Kathleen Garvey.

85
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,711
Decent crowd.

86
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,435
- Lord, hear us.
- They're here for Grace.

87
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,589
Lord, graciously hear us.

88
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,713
Yeah, well,
I didn't think they were here for Elvis.

89
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,512
Let us take a moment now in silent prayer

90
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,764
for our own private intentions.

91
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,003
Oh, Jesus.

92
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,301
All right.

93
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:15,574
Here at Today show,
good to have you with us as always.

94
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,163
You didn't microwave this, did you?

95
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,291
No, I just... Yeah, we did.

96
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:28,837
- You're an animal.
- Sorry. In a rush, but yeah.

97
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,009
Need anything else?
You'll be all right for a couple of hours?

98
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,677
Thirty days lying on my pregnant arse.

99
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,055
I don't think another couple of hours
will kill me.

100
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,369
Why you working on a Saturday anyway?

101
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:44,061
It's just, you know,
a new claim with a few issues.

102
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,270
What's the matter?

103
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:47,606
You look awful. You're pale and sweaty.

104
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,484
Well, you know, you're really fat.

105
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,571
Don't have a heart attack.

106
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:59,243
Please. If anything happens to you,
remember I can't even shit without you.

107
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:03,956
That's nasty talk.

108
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:05,373
I know.

109
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:10,587
And don't worry.

110
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,131
Not about anything, okay?

111
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,928
And don't move. Definitely don't move.

112
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,055
You'll cause damage to the house.

113
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,017
I miss being pretty.

114
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,310
You're still pretty.

115
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:28,313
You're like a very pretty beach ball.

116
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,025
That's Matt.

117
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,447
I know, but I need him on this.
He's family. Sometimes.

118
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,717
He doesn't know what he's doing,
and he's a lazy bastard.

119
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,101
Theresa, I'm gonna pull rank here.

120
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:44,580
Shut up. Have you read this one?

121
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,248
Just twice.

122
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,876
Well, get stuck back in there. No.

123
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:53,630
Bring me back a surprise.

124
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:55,882
Okay. Like what?

125
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:58,468
A puppy.

126
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,681
Or chips.

127
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,310
Chips?

128
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:10,564
Fuck.

129
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,943
You look like you slept in a kennel.

130
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,070
Did you sleep in a kennel?

131
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,989
Last night? No.

132
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,117
Tom.

133
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:23,801
What did... Wait, you can't go like that.

134
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:24,912
Go where?

135
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,831
She's not an Alsatian, Tom.

136
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:31,335
She can't hear through two floors
of insulation and carpet.

137
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,170
Well, you're wrong there.

138
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,422
You need a smart jacket.

139
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,942
- What do I need a smart jacket for?
- The new insurance claim.

140
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,927
- We need to look into it.
- What new claim?

141
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,638
What new claim?

142
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,233
Jesus. That's enough to retire on.

143
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:55,316
Yeah.

144
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,279
Well, we've got to make sure
that doesn't happen.

145
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:58,654
Let's go.

146
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:00,572
Wait.

147
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:08,080
John Paul was
an active member of the church,

148
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:12,543
a devoted family man,
and amateur humorist.

149
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:18,257
God gave John Paul the strength
to be an unforgettable human being.

150
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:22,928
And let us give thanks
for the joy he spread his whole life long.

151
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,601
Now, chosen by Grace,
John Paul's favorite hymn.

152
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,922
You don't have to pretend anymore.

153
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,733
- That is hot.
- King of Christmas has arrived.

154
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,736
I made brussels sprouts.
They're overcooked, just as you like.

155
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:21,862
These are for you.

156
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,615
- All right, my favorite.
- Very, very, very deliberate.

157
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,617
They've been better.

158
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,368
- Anyone for anything else?
- We're fine.

159
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,138
- We have loads.
- You got enough ham? Okay.

160
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,205
Look at them, Donal.

161
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:34,583
There's women's lib for you.
Heads of the table. Both ends.

162
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,045
Plenty of room
and us men hemmed in like tinned fish.

163
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,630
No offense, Nora.

164
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:42,317
- You don't have enough space, John Paul?
- I don't know how you do it.

165
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,061
You've got a big house, and still
you manage to make us feel crammed.

166
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,321
I've got no room for my elbows.

167
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:49,973
Well, that is a terrible, awful,
terrible shame.

168
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,391
Are we starting without Becka?

169
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:54,144
We were just talking about
why Eva needs a house this size.

170
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:59,483
- I mean, why wouldn't a spinster…
- "A spinster"? A spinster, everybody.

171
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,003
You could sell this place and give
your sisters their rightful share.

172
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:05,089
- We don't want to sell our parents' home.
- Yeah, Eva brought us up in this house.

173
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,008
It's all we've got left of them.
Why would we sell it?

174
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,534
He knows all that.

175
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:12,913
That sentimentality is just
very convenient for Eva is all I'm saying.

176
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,831
- We're here!
- Yay.

177
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,543
- Donal, quick wager on who she's with.
- Hola, chicas!

178
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,379
- It was a junkie last Christmas.
- It was a student.

179
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:22,899
- I say "stranded Polish builder"?
- Come on, it's Father Christmas!

180
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,676
- No, you're all right, JP.
- Come on. It's for fun.

181
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,970
Hey! Happy Christmas!

182
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,471
- This is Frank, everyone.
- Hiya.

183
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,098
Frank, this is my family.

184
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,575
- Hiya.
- I wouldn't have guessed that.

185
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,851
- And John Paul.
- Frank.

186
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,951
- Frank. Hey.
- I'm only joking with you.

187
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:38,105
- Are you now?
- How are ya?

188
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,857
Nice to meet you. Are you gonna eat or…

189
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,109
- Please, if you'll have me.
- Yeah.

190
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,570
- This is lovely, you all.
- "Frank."

191
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,574
- That's a very unusual name for a...
- Millennial.

192
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:51,201
It's an unusual name for a millennial, no?

193
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:53,078
- Is it?
- I think so. Yes.

194
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:55,538
Hi, sweetheart.

195
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:00,085
Go easy on those.
You'll end up the size of your cousin.

196
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,548
What? It's puppy fat.
It's completely normal.

197
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,216
You all right?

198
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,886
You gonna come with us
on the swim tomorrow?

199
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:09,803
Really?

200
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,389
- Yeah.
- Yeah. That's a nice idea.

201
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,284
- Shall we do that? You're old enough now.
- Yeah.

202
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:15,577
Do you go swimming every Christmas?

203
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,270
Yeah. We used to do it
with our parents when we were little,

204
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,397
so we kept it up as a tradition, you know.

205
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,566
Did Becka not tell you
that we're tragic orphans?

206
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,193
Come on.

207
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:27,070
- Have you not done it? You ever done it?
- No. Way too cold for me.

208
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,382
- I'll buy you a wet suit.
- It's not. It takes 30 seconds,

209
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,342
- and then it's, like, balmy.
- You get used to it.

210
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:34,286
Do what this one does. Put your pinky in.

211
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,622
- Itsy-bitsy. One toe at a time.
- …how dare you?

212
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,457
- Molly, over here!
- Stop.

213
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,917
Over here!

214
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,174
Do you need some privacy?

215
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,968
Well, I'm going to the toilet, JP,
so yeah.

216
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:57,809
Will you flush for me, please?

217
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,152
This is the last one.

218
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,863
It's for you. It's from all of us.

219
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,699
Is it a dog bed?

220
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:14,409
What?

221
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,411
Don't ever lower those standards, Gracie.

222
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:18,538
Okay.

223
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,999
Who wrapped this?

224
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,548
It's a dry robe for after the swim.

225
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,217
- Like yours.
- Yeah.

226
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,177
I love it.

227
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:38,225
I think there's still one more gift
under the Christmas tree.

228
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,061
Someone must have been very good
this year.

229
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:43,230
It's for you, my love.

230
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:46,984
But I didn't bring...
I thought we were doing ours tomorrow.

231
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,989
- Wow.
- Wow.

232
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,536
Look at her face.

233
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:00,789
I want to see. Let's see.

234
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:05,043
Isn't it beautiful?

235
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:06,587
It is, yeah.

236
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,963
There you go.

237
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,089
Let me look at you.

238
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,133
Lucky old Mammy, yeah?

239
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:13,802
- Come here.
- Let's save that for home, shall we?

240
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:18,974
All right.

241
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:22,769
After all that excitement,
I have some news.

242
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:23,854
Let's hear it.

243
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:29,610
I just put an offer on a studio in town,

244
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:32,863
and I'm gonna be opening
my own massage business in the new year.

245
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,282
- Hey!
- Go, becka!

246
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:39,119
Well, here's to launching a new
venture in a depression with no money.

247
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:42,372
We're delighted for you.
Anything you need, you just say.

248
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:45,083
Mam and Dad would be proud. Me too.

249
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,252
It's fantastic. A massage, please.

250
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:49,377
- Okay.
- Well done, Becka!

251
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:52,007
- As we are all making announcements…
- Brilliant.

252
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,593
…I've got some news too.

253
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:55,719
Are you pregnant?

254
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,682
The fuck kind of thing is that to say?

255
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,187
Go on, Eva, love.

256
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:12,277
So, Gerald, my boss...

257
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:13,487
And mine.

258
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,365
And John Paul's boss, of course.

259
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,159
He's looking for a new financial director,

260
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:23,372
and after a lot of thought,
I've put myself up for the promotion.

261
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:25,499
- Brilliant.
- Yeah.

262
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,503
You're amazing. It's official.

263
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,756
- Well done, honey.
- That's fantastic. Great.

264
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,133
- Nice one. You've earned it, love.
- God.

265
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:37,970
Wh... mind my head!

266
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,721
Can you control your child, please?

267
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:41,390
Control your temper, JP.

268
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,559
Oh, my...

269
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:46,737
Mammy, I think it's time.
We're heading home.

270
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,938
Get your stuff together.

271
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,858
Blanaid? Get your presents together.

272
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,652
I'll just... Let's just... You know.

273
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:54,820
Don't worry about that.

274
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,655
- No, we should. I want to.
- Come on.

275
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,409
It's not even nine o'clock.

276
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,870
- I'm not telling you what to do, Grace.
- Well, you are.

277
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:05,122
Wait, no.
We just want you to say what you want.

278
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,165
The odd time to stand up
for yourself, you know.

279
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:09,418
It's Christmas Eve.
We barely get to see you anymore.

280
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:12,379
What kind of a prick asks someone
who can't have kids if she's pregnant?

281
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,463
It was a joke.

282
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:15,382
- Oh, my God.
- It was a fucking joke?

283
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,759
- It came out wrong...
- When are you gonna wake up?

284
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,094
When are you gonna stop?

285
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,474
I'm sorry. I'm so...

286
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:26,768
I'm really sorry.

287
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:29,354
- Mammy, come on. Let's go.
- Coming!

288
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,482
Look, I know he isn't easy and…

289
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,944
and I know
you don't think he's a good man,

290
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,448
but he's a good husband,
he's a good father and he makes me happy.

291
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:42,701
Can you not just let me be happy?

292
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,668
I will see you tomorrow
at the Forty Foot for the swim.

293
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:52,753
Yeah. Okay.

294
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:53,962
And it'll be nice, right?

295
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:56,924
See you there.

296
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:58,592
Loony.

297
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,974
Fantastic. Great.

298
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,562
I swear to God
if he calls her "Mammy" one more time…

299
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:12,105
Where's my coat, Mammy?

300
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:15,317
Please, John… next Christmas.

301
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,665
- Happy Christmas!
- Happy Christmas.

302
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:32,626
Is your daddy home? Where else
would he be on Christmas Day, says you.

303
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:36,296
- Happy Christmas, Roger.
- Happy Christmas, Grace.

304
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,840
You look gorgeous.

305
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,925
- Happy Christmas to...
- Happy Christmas.

306
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,511
Box of oysters for a starter.

307
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:44,948
If you're having a starter
or if you're already set for a starter,

308
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,557
it'll make a lovely amuse-bouche.

309
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,992
That's really thoughtful of you, Roger.

310
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:51,186
It is...
How long have they been sitting out?

311
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,271
No time.

312
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:56,316
See, the sister was set to join me
for lunch, and she loves an oyster,

313
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,902
but she had a nasty fall
coming back from the pub.

314
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:01,864
So that's off the cards,
and I don't eat them myself.

315
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:05,909
- Oh, no. So, are you on your own, or...
- No, let's not... no.

316
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,328
Very thoughtful. Happy Christmas.

317
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:10,765
- Are you taking the boat out...
- I'm not taking the boat out. Nope.

318
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:11,832
Okay. Happy Christmas.

319
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:26,722
Fuck.

320
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:28,891
- Mammy!
- Yeah?

321
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,517
Not you.

322
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:31,852
Blanaid, where's your mum?

323
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,770
She's upstairs, changing for the swim.

324
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:46,033
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town

325
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,703
This Christmas

326
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:56,043
So, just a tiny bit
of vinegar and shallot on there.

327
00:22:56,126 --> 00:23:00,297
No Tabasco this year, Mammy.
I won't make that mistake again.

328
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,507
Here it goes.

329
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:07,763
- Good?
- Lovely.

330
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,731
Happy Christmas, Mammy.

331
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,274
Happy Christmas, love.

332
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,743
Have you blankets?

333
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,037
Yeah. Becks,
would you mind getting them, please?

334
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,121
Put your cream on.

335
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:35,374
- Yeah.
- And grab the hot water bottles too.

336
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:38,460
Yeah. Would you stop ordering me around?
I'm not your wife.

337
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:40,044
Right.

338
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,048
Do you think one flask is enough?

339
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,967
No, I don't.

340
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,010
Come here. Well done.

341
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:52,975
Take the bread out at a quarter past.
It'll need to sit for an hour anyway.

342
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:54,810
It'll be perfect by the time we get home.

343
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,937
- Come on, Blanaid.
- What are you doing?

344
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,898
We're going to the Forty Foot.
We'll be back as quick as we can.

345
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:01,859
You had a glass of champagne.
You can't drive.

346
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,443
- I'm grand, really.
- No.

347
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,696
You can't drive. You had a large...
Are you kidding me?

348
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,924
- No. I'm perfectly...
- There'll be guards on every corner.

349
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:09,366
Come on, now. Think.

350
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:14,238
- Well, maybe you can drive us then?
- Of course I can't. I had a glass myself.

351
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:17,749
I've not missed a swim since I was little.
I'll be perfectly fine.

352
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:23,338
Now, why would you go and make a scene
on Christmas Day?

353
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:28,260
I'm not having Blanaid in a rough sea
with her mother drunk.

354
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:30,512
Absolutely not.

355
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,226
So sorry, sweetheart.

356
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:39,146
I just worry too much.

357
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:16,558
Would you?

358
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:25,192
"Sorry. We're not gonna make it. My fault.
Too much to drink. Have fun. Kiss, kiss."

359
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:26,944
What the fuck?

360
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:29,571
- The prick.
- Yeah. No way. That is not happening.

361
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,217
Looks like it is happening.

362
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:10,487
Come on, Becka!

363
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:17,077
Becka!

364
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:27,337
Don't do that, fuck's sake.

365
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,723
Hey, come on. I'll race you back.

366
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:44,646
Bibi!

367
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:03,999
Hey, Long John Silver! How are ya?

368
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,001
See anything you like?

369
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,544
Don't.

370
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:10,756
It's your fault. They've never seen
a single woman over 40 before.

371
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:14,134
It's not that. They've just never seen
nipples as gigantic as yours.

372
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:15,802
Like? You're such a pervert.

373
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:17,638
My arse.

374
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:28,232
Well, that's it then.

375
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:30,859
Just the four of us now.

376
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,612
- Break Mum and Dad's hearts.
- Good job they're dust.

377
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:36,573
Why would you say that?
It's just one Christmas.

378
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:38,200
It's not just one Christmas.

379
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:40,869
We're losing her.

380
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:46,542
She's not like the girl she was.
She's getting quieter and smaller.

381
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:49,044
You can't grow in the shadow of the prick.

382
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:51,505
- She was always quiet.
- That's bollocks.

383
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:52,673
What's bollocks about it?

384
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:54,633
It's just not true, Becka.

385
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,762
She wasn't always like that.
He's sucking the life out of her.

386
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:00,156
She doesn't stand up to him though.

387
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,367
You say anything to her,
and she thinks that you're jealous.

388
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:03,809
She doesn't thin... She knows…

389
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:09,189
She knows that's not why we're…
It's just him getting to her.

390
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:14,403
Well, we'll just have to wait
till he dies of cancer or something.

391
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:16,655
Yeah, the best part of her life
will be over by then.

392
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:19,783
I don't know. He's got gout.
And that ulcer.

393
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:22,619
Lucky wind, he could fuck off
in the next ten.

394
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:24,121
Could happen before then.

395
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,165
People get killed every day.

396
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:28,584
What's that mean?

397
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:30,919
I mean,
why not give nature a helping hand?

398
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:33,255
All our worries would be over.

399
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:41,221
I often think about punching through
that soft spot in his head

400
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:44,224
- right through to his brain.
- Jesus, Bibi.

401
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:45,726
I'd feed him to the Hurleys' pigs.

402
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:48,187
Bury him piece by piece
in their mushroom beds.

403
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,397
More shit for them to grow out of.

404
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:58,280
Fine! I'd tamper with the brakes
of his shitty Volvo

405
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:00,008
- if I knew what the fuck I was doing.
- Yeah!

406
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,033
Yes, finally.

407
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:03,869
Shove him into deep, dark water.

408
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:05,120
Feed him to the sharks.

409
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:07,581
Let the seagulls feed off his eyes.

410
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:11,126
- I'd gouge his eyes out…
- You shove him out of a plane.

411
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,295
- Kill the prick.
- Kill the prick!

412
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:15,380
I fucking hate him!

413
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:26,767
"Holy mother of God,
pray for us sinners now,"

414
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,268
and at the hour of our death.

415
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:32,314
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

416
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:33,857
Blessed art thou amongst women

417
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:36,276
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.

418
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,070
Holy Mary, mother of God,

419
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:40,739
pray for us sinners now,
and at the hour of our death.

420
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:44,618
Glory to the Father, and to the Son,

421
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:45,953
and to the Holy Ghost.

422
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:47,871
As it was in the beginning,

423
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:50,791
"is now, and ever shall be,
world without end."

424
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:57,548
And so, as we commit
John Paul Williams to the earth,

425
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:04,221
in the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

426
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:05,304
Amen.

427
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:14,022
Everything bad that could have happened
has happened.

428
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:20,362
- Yeah. I've got it.
- Except that.

429
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,329
Goodbye, my love.

430
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,793
"Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."

431
00:30:34,877 --> 00:30:36,795
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures,

432
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:38,922
he leadeth me beside the still waters.

433
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,340
He restoreth my soul.

434
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:44,178
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

435
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:46,513
Though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death,

436
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:47,973
I will fear no evil.

437
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:51,101
For thou art with me, thy rod
and thy staff they comfort me.

438
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:55,230
…preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

439
00:30:55,314 --> 00:30:57,107
"Thou anointest my head with oil…"

440
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:58,233
It's over.

441
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:02,279
"Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life,

442
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:04,489
and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever."

443
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:07,826
Why did I have to wear
a smart jacket anyway?

444
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:09,703
We're going to Williams' funeral.

445
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:13,498
What? No way, yeah?
You can drive me to the pub, but I'm not...

446
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:16,001
Listen, that family
have claimed four times in the last year.

447
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:17,711
One year.

448
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:20,231
Something isn't adding up. We're not
paying out if it's not above board.

449
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:21,566
But what are we gonna do about it?

450
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,717
I mean, they're not claiming
for a cracked windscreen.

451
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,177
He's fucking dead.

452
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,739
It's only void for suicide
or what you call it? Malicious intent.

453
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:29,806
Right. Then we find malicious intent.

454
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:31,642
Under what circumstances?

455
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:36,873
- What are you doing?
- I'm grabbing the folder.

456
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:39,083
Do you want someone
who isn't driving to grab it for you?

457
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:40,192
- Yes.
- Yeah.

458
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:44,947
Yeah, go to the police report.

459
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,490
So the police are investigating it?

460
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:50,160
Well, no. Look, nothing suspicious
was found but look at the photo.

461
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:53,205
Jesus.

462
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,293
Strange way to meet your end, no?

463
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:02,756
The family will have
their guard down today.

464
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,551
All we need to do is observe and listen.

465
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:09,304
Who knows if there's foul play here,
but if there is,

466
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,224
the culprit usually shows up
at the funeral.

467
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:15,936
All right, Columbo.

468
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:22,109
Sorry for your loss.

469
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:25,362
Thank you. It is such a loss.

470
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,948
I'm just glad the suffering's over.

471
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:30,325
- Was he ill?
- No.

472
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:35,080
I have to…

473
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:37,332
Well…

474
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,668
Deepest condolences.

475
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,003
Thanks.

476
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:44,298
Shocking. It's a grisly way to go.

477
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:48,010
Gerald Fisher. Your daddy's boss.

478
00:32:48,594 --> 00:32:49,636
Ex-boss.

479
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:52,306
Anything I can do, please.

480
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,266
I'm only a phone call away.

481
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,352
I don't have your number.

482
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:12,159
Are you joking me? There's no booze?

483
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:16,205
If you're not serving booze at an afters,
why have an afters?

484
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,373
To honor John Paul's sobriety.

485
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:20,584
Public pioneer. Private pisshead.

486
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,461
It's no wonder Father Doyle skipped out.

487
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:26,965
- That's my scarf, Becka.
- I know.

488
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:28,133
Where you going?

489
00:33:28,217 --> 00:33:29,301
To get a proper drink.

490
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:30,384
You okay? Becka?

491
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:32,054
I want that scarf back, Becka.

492
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:37,559
What? She always keeps my shit.

493
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:43,899
Hang on a second. This is their house.

494
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:47,528
Yeah. Well, her house now.

495
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:50,739
Pretty nice.

496
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:53,242
On an accountant's salary too.

497
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:54,701
This doesn't feel right.

498
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:56,471
It's just 'cause your body's
so weird and long.

499
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:59,831
I mean going into someone's private home
doesn't feel right, you berk.

500
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:01,834
- I didn't sign up for this.
- Look.

501
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:05,420
We're gonna drop in, pay our respects,
sound out the widow,

502
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:08,507
and then you can go back to practicing
chords or paint your toenails

503
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,634
or whatever you do in your hovel...
Hold the door.

504
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:20,435
Come on.

505
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:25,315
Sorry for your troubles.

506
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:28,694
Well, I came to say goodbye.

507
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:30,696
Are you going already?

508
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:33,489
Yeah, I wa...
But I wanted to say goodbye properly.

509
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:34,574
Goodbye.

510
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:44,708
Goodbye, Grace.

511
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:51,800
Which one do you think is the widow?

512
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:54,261
- Hard to tell.
- We shouldn't be here.

513
00:34:57,806 --> 00:34:58,849
That's her.

514
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:04,313
So sorry for your troubles, Mrs. Williams.

515
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:07,649
Thomas Claffin, Claffin and Sons.
This is Matthew Claffin.

516
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,903
We're the holders
of John Paul's life insurance policy.

517
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:13,405
Mrs. Williams is my sister.

518
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:16,992
My apologies.

519
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:18,911
The likeness.

520
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:21,705
I hope you're not here to talk business.
She's been through a lot.

521
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:27,711
What?

522
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:30,422
Someone died.
Seriously, have some respect.

523
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:32,442
Do you think Dad would have
gate-crashed a funeral?

524
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:33,902
He wouldn't let his business go bust.

525
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:36,053
- He wouldn't have done this.
- How would you know?

526
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:45,020
Matt, sorry. Matt.

527
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:57,866
Condolences.

528
00:35:58,492 --> 00:35:59,576
Thomas Claffin.

529
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:03,163
Are you related to the deceased?

530
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:05,707
Yeah. He was our brother-in-law.

531
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:09,378
Yes. One could see the similarities.

532
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:12,256
I'm sorry for your loss.

533
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:14,758
Yeah. We're really gonna miss that prick.

534
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:20,722
If you wouldn't mind just
leaving us with our grief. Thank you.

535
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,391
Of course.

536
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:24,309
Excuse me.

537
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:30,774
Can you just engage your brain a second
before you speak?

538
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:34,403
Why? He's not the police.
He's just an insurance twat.

539
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:36,185
Yeah, but what's he doing here?

540
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,877
She's in the back, changing the barrel.

541
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:55,215
And hopefully her attitude,
the rude bitch.

542
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,052
You?

543
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:03,765
Yeah, it's me all right.
How do I know you?

544
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:06,185
Have we…?

545
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:08,729
I mean, have we ever…

546
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:12,524
So you nearly kill a man in the morning
but it's just foggy to you by lunch?

547
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:15,777
Oh, shit.

548
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:18,614
Sandwich boy.

549
00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:21,950
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

550
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:23,952
How was your sandwich?

551
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:26,538
Seriously, how's your leg?

552
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,415
It's mainly my lower back.

553
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:31,919
Well, if you're laying the groundwork
for a court case, good luck.

554
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:33,253
Juries love me.

555
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:38,133
Nice tight jacket.

556
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:41,220
It's my brother's. It's…

557
00:37:42,471 --> 00:37:45,349
It's not actually mine.
I'll just keep it on.

558
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:47,267
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No, you're okay.

559
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:49,520
- I can buy my own. Thanks.
- Okay.

560
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,190
Well, then can you get me one? I'm skint.

561
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:57,152
What are you drinking?

562
00:37:57,903 --> 00:37:59,696
Gin and tonic, please. Double and slim.

563
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:01,907
Save you washing up.

564
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:06,286
Becka.

565
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:08,704
Matt.

566
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,383
My condolences, Mrs. Williams.

567
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,176
Thomas Claffin, Claffin and Sons.

568
00:38:21,677 --> 00:38:24,137
We're handling John Paul's
life insurance policy.

569
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:25,389
Insurance?

570
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:27,992
I haven't even looked
at the policy documents yet.

571
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:30,894
Well, of course. No.
Thankfully, I'm just here to help.

572
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:32,020
May I?

573
00:38:33,397 --> 00:38:35,691
Egg and onion?
It's like you knew I was coming.

574
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:37,775
Did you?

575
00:38:38,277 --> 00:38:40,195
You've had some awful luck recently.

576
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:41,280
And now this.

577
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,117
It's just the icing on an awful,
horrible cake.

578
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:48,579
It must have been such a shock,
John Paul's accident.

579
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:50,247
Well, of course it was.

580
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:53,292
From any I had with him,
he never came across as a reckless man.

581
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,294
- I'm sorry, is there a problem?
- No.

582
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:56,837
Not really.

583
00:38:57,713 --> 00:38:59,590
Well, just a couple of questions.

584
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:02,926
Before we pay out,
we need to go over a few details with you.

585
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,595
Details?

586
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:08,727
Can I pop by tomorrow?
Would that be convenient?

587
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:11,143
Day after? You say.

588
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:14,146
- Yes, but I'd need to...
- You've got a lot on your mind. Apologies.

589
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:17,065
I'll give you a call. How about that?
We'll keep it casual.

590
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:22,446
Actually, one quick question,
Mrs. Williams,

591
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:24,072
if you don't mind while I'm here.

592
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:27,129
Where were you
the night your husband died?

593
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:30,078
I know where John Paul was,
but where were you?

594
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:31,705
I was with my sisters.

595
00:39:33,582 --> 00:39:35,334
Right. Of course.

596
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:37,294
Think I just met all of them.
Lively bunch.

597
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:39,522
Well, let me get out of your hair.

598
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:43,217
This is purely a courtesy visit
to a valued client at a difficult time,

599
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,969
which I have taken up enough of, I'm sure.
I'm just going to…

600
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,138
You know, it's a long ride home.

601
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:50,140
Have you a paper plate?

602
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:52,476
Don't worry.

603
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:55,479
Napkin.

604
00:39:57,356 --> 00:39:58,774
You don't live around here though.

605
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:00,651
Pretty sure I'd have spotted you.

606
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:02,528
Well, I was in London.

607
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:03,654
The Big Smoke.

608
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:06,865
Yeah. Got back about a year ago.

609
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:09,701
Shit, it was a year ago.

610
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,037
Yeah. Time flies.

611
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:15,249
What do you do for yourself?

612
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:17,668
Well, I work with my brother.

613
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:18,752
My half-brother.

614
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:21,922
For the last... Well, since I got back.

615
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:25,759
But it's not my end goal sort of thing.

616
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:27,386
I play bass.

617
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,847
- Bass guitar.
- God.

618
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:34,935
I had a band in London,
that's why I was there. But we broke up.

619
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:37,354
Exile in Babylon.

620
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:40,649
Exile in what?

621
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:42,526
Exile in Babylon.

622
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:45,946
What? What are you laughing at?

623
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:47,656
Nothing. I'm just...

624
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,118
I'm just picturing
all the black-and-white moody photographs

625
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:53,871
in front of Notting Hill bong shops, like…

626
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:57,165
So, why'd your band break up?

627
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,626
Apart from the terrible name?

628
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:02,629
Brexit.

629
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:09,011
For what it's worth, bassists
are my favorite of all the rhythm section.

630
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:11,638
Although I have dated more drummers,
in fairness.

631
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:13,724
But that's just bad luck.

632
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:16,582
But I'm always lucky in my bad luck.

633
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:18,312
Is that right?

634
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:21,565
No.

635
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:24,818
Not really.

636
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,654
Not anymore anyway.

637
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:31,116
What is it you do yourself?

638
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:33,410
I'm a massage therapist.

639
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:37,789
I have my own business.
It's just small, but…

640
00:41:43,337 --> 00:41:44,379
I have to go.

641
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:47,298
But listen.

642
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,540
Why don't I give you a freebie?

643
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,155
Make up for nearly killing you?

644
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:55,015
- No, you're fine. Honestly.
- Oh, no. Come on. I'm good.

645
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:57,184
I'm actually really good at what I do.

646
00:41:58,644 --> 00:41:59,770
Come here.

647
00:42:01,522 --> 00:42:02,898
You should get this fixed.

648
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:08,570
There you go.

649
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,490
Now we're connected.

650
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:37,474
Can I get the same again, please?

651
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,564
- You smell like a pub toilet.
- Do I? Thought it was a kennel.

652
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:46,733
Well, it's both now, so congratulations.

653
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:55,367
- What's your problem? Oh, grow up.
- That was mortifying earlier.

654
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,869
No, don't talk to me like that.

655
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,413
- What are you looking for?
- My pills.

656
00:42:59,496 --> 00:43:01,164
What pills? Why are you taking pills for?

657
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:03,608
- You have no idea how bad things are.
- Well, then tell me!

658
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:10,984
- I can't swallow, and it's...
- Would you just...

659
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:14,052
Would you just pull over.
Pull over, for Christ's sake.

660
00:43:24,146 --> 00:43:25,939
I think you need to take some time off.

661
00:43:31,028 --> 00:43:32,529
We're this close to bankruptcy.

662
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:36,241
What? How? Dad never had any...

663
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:39,077
Dad's accounting
wasn't one of his greatest talents, okay?

664
00:43:39,995 --> 00:43:42,331
If we have to pay out on this,
the business is finished.

665
00:43:42,414 --> 00:43:45,167
I'm telling you that right now.
We lose everything.

666
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:51,381
My wife's bedridden.

667
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:53,884
My first kid is weeks away.

668
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:57,513
If she even gets that far.
I can't lose the business too.

669
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:00,700
- I just can't lose the business.
- Hold on a minute. Hey.

670
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:02,059
Hey, that's not gonna happen.

671
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:05,204
Right? 'Cause we won't let that happen.

672
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:10,734
Look, if you think there's something
there to find, well, then we'll find it.

673
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:17,241
Okay.

674
00:44:20,077 --> 00:44:21,161
Okay.

675
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:22,913
Thanks.

676
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:52,109
Jesus Christ!

677
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:53,735
- Sorry.
- Grace!

678
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:56,113
Oh, my God. I live on my own.

679
00:44:57,114 --> 00:44:58,591
People don't walk into my house uninvited

680
00:44:58,615 --> 00:45:00,701
unless they're planning
to do something bad to me.

681
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:02,104
I'm sorry. I should have knocked.

682
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:07,207
Meals for one.
That's what's ahead of me too now.

683
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:09,084
It's more fun than it looks.

684
00:45:10,127 --> 00:45:11,211
It's not.

685
00:45:15,132 --> 00:45:16,341
I did a stupid thing.

686
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:19,136
What?

687
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,473
That insurance detective
was asking me a load of questions earlier.

688
00:45:23,557 --> 00:45:26,351
He's not a detective, Grace.

689
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:29,396
He's the insurance dick.
He's just a creep.

690
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:32,983
He asked me where I was
the night John Paul died.

691
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:36,195
I said I was with you.

692
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:38,906
I said I was with my sisters.

693
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:43,160
Why would...

694
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:45,746
I'm just gonna turn the…

695
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:50,125
I don't know why I did it.

696
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:53,003
I just panicked, I think. I... He...

697
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:56,507
He made me feel really uncomfortable
and I just got worried.

698
00:45:57,216 --> 00:45:59,176
Does it mean I'm a suspect?
Am I a suspect?

699
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:01,094
What do you mean a suspect?

700
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:06,058
It was an accident. There...
I mean, there's no inquiry.

701
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:07,702
- What do you mean?
- But I was on my own.

702
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:10,604
There's nobody to confirm.
I was waiting for John Paul to come home.

703
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:14,107
Grace! They're insurance men
who don't want to pay out.

704
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:16,068
That's all it is. I mean, come on.

705
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:17,319
Okay.

706
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:20,489
But what if it jeopardizes the claim?
I mean, I can't afford to...

707
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:23,158
We'll back you up.

708
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:27,287
We'll just say we were with you, you know.
It's not far from the truth, is it?

709
00:46:27,788 --> 00:46:29,988
We were planning to hang out
that day anyway. It's fine.

710
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:32,584
It will be fine. Don't worry.

711
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:37,172
- Oh, God, my mouth is so dry.
- No. Just... Sorry.

712
00:46:37,256 --> 00:46:39,842
Just... It's just prosecco.

713
00:46:41,093 --> 00:46:43,428
With a bit of vodka.
I'm stopping tomorrow.

714
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,401
Hey.

715
00:46:58,485 --> 00:46:59,903
We've got a problem.

716
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:01,780
Yeah. Can you come round?

717
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:11,081
Jesus.

718
00:47:11,582 --> 00:47:15,085
He's dead. He's in the ground.
He's Satan's problem now.

719
00:47:15,169 --> 00:47:16,795
She said she was with us?

720
00:47:16,879 --> 00:47:18,815
Yeah, she's just shone a light
on everything we did.

721
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:20,215
So, it's our problem now.

722
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:24,178
The prick is dead, and we've got
our sister back. That's all that matters.

723
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:25,822
We can't let them
bring the police into this.

724
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:28,599
The police? I've got three kids.
I can't go to prison.

725
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:29,766
Just calm down.

726
00:47:30,601 --> 00:47:31,894
No one's going to prison.

727
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:33,830
Oh, my God.
You look so much like Mam right now.

728
00:47:33,854 --> 00:47:36,231
Fuck's sake, Bibi.
We just all need to be on the same page.

729
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:39,318
And we keep Grace out of this.

730
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:42,321
She can't find out what we did.

731
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:51,330
We just stay calm,
and we look out for each other.

732
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:54,967
- Give me your hands.
- No. I'm not doing it.

733
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:56,376
- Come on!
- Fuck's sake.

734
00:48:02,132 --> 00:48:04,384
We just look out for each other
like we always have.

735
00:48:06,261 --> 00:48:07,179
Right?

736
00:48:07,262 --> 00:48:08,263
Always.
