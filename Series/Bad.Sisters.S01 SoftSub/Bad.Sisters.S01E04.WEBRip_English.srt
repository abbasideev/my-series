0
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,120
<i>This is Inspector Loftus.</i>

1
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:40,624
<i>Sorry, I can't get to the phone.
Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

2
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,542
What's up with you?

3
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,211
Well, you don't expect
to be ghosted by a Garda inspector.

4
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,006
I thought you were meeting this morning.
- Didn't show up.

5
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,530
Left me standing outside
Dundrum shopping center like a loser.

6
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,556
Maybe just stop calling him.
He's not that into you.

7
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,560
So, youngest sister. I googled her.

8
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,605
Wine surgically attached.
Different lad in every photo.

9
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,191
Goes to tampon protests.
Floaty, that kind of vibe.

10
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,569
I just don't know what we achieve
hassling this woman.

11
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:12,111
We might be able to spook her into telling
us something the others wouldn't.

12
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,449
And it's her time.

13
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,702
Creep.

14
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,187
So, when you're talking to her,

15
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,940
focus on the lawyer's giveaways,
which are?

16
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,901
Matt.
- What?

17
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:53,071
Refusal to name the victim directly.
Convoluted sentences.

18
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,572
Jesus.

19
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:58,952
Why are you taking that stuff
like it's your job? You all right?

20
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,537
My esophagus is on fire.

21
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,331
Like a shit dragon.

22
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:03,832
Here.

23
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:07,335
After this, I need you to go to
the pub where JP was the night he died.

24
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,044
Why?
- Sniff around.

25
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:13,091
Flirt with the barmaid. Find out
what JP did, who he talked to, okay?

26
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,801
Fine.
- No! Goddamn!

27
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,220
Come on!

28
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:20,265
Geez, man. You're becoming zero craic
in all of this, you know that?

29
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,893
What flat number's she?
- It's open.

30
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,065
Here. This could be him.

31
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,108
Shit. Here. It's Theresa.

32
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,528
Here. You take the lead in this.

33
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,697
You all right, darling?

34
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,950
Yeah, is it important?
Just because we've...

35
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,537
Mayonnaise? Well...

36
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,627
Just because it's not in the room
doesn't mean...

37
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,043
It's in the fridge.

38
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,649
I'll bring it up later. I need to go.

39
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,633
You're not at the gym.
- Of course.

40
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,178
Is this a surprise?
Are you jetting me to Paris or something?

41
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,888
Becka. Garvey.

42
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,890
Sorry. I had to take a call.

43
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,058
Thomas Claffin, Claffin Insurance.

44
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,686
Rebecca Garvey, I presume?

45
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,773
The insurance brothers?

46
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,066
We can come back
if now isn't convenient, Ms. Garvey.

47
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:15,028
A few questions about your
brother-in-law's death. Won't take long.

48
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:46,161
We're so sorry for your loss, Ms. Garvey.
- Thanks.

49
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,746
Matt, would you like to...
- No.

50
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:50,999
Shit.

51
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,919
As you know, we're just crossing the T's
and dotting the I's on John Paul's claim,

52
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,924
making sure your sister, Grace,
gets what she deserves.

53
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,639
So, were you close to the deceased?

54
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:08,767
He was...

55
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,644
I mean, we weren't...

56
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,314
He was nice.

57
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:15,399
Was he?

58
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,819
Your sisters said something different.

59
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,154
Washing the floors?

60
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,946
What did they say?
- "He's a prick." "He's a pleasure."

61
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,455
Now, which is it, Rebecca?
- Yeah. Which is it, Rebecca?

62
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,791
Becka.

63
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,170
I mean, you know families. They're...

64
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,338
What?

65
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,717
Complex.

66
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,676
So, massage?

67
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,929
What about it?
- Does it keep you busy?

68
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,140
Yeah, I've got my hands full.

69
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,729
Do you operate out of your own studio?
- Not at the moment.

70
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,941
No? Are your family
not supportive of your massage work?

71
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,192
Yes.

72
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:02,737
Yeah, but you don't have your own studio.
You just... What? You bring people here?

73
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:03,822
All right, now, hang on.

74
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,740
Have you ever been
in financial difficulty, Ms. Garvey?

75
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,451
Haven't we all?
- Could you not ask your sisters for help?

76
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,788
Well, you can't always rely on people.
- That's true. That's very true.

77
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,749
But all those nice houses
and no one could give you a hand?

78
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,669
You need to go. I have a client,
and you don't have a right to be here,

79
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,087
so I need you to go.
- Yep.

80
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,506
Don't leave the country, Ms. Garvey.
- I'll do what I want.

81
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,383
Yeah, on your own head be it.

82
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:26,470
Thanks for your time.

83
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,391
Bloody hell, Matt.

84
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,435
Hey. I didn't know you had that in you.

85
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,895
You really got her rattled.

86
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,023
Good-looking girl. Stunning eyes.

87
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,276
Cold, though. Like a lizard.

88
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,652
I have...

89
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:43,779
Shit!

90
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,280
Something to tell you.

91
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,199
I know her. Becka Garvey.

92
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,494
We were seeing each other.

93
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,623
What? Is she the one
that keeps calling and texting you?

94
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,708
Yeah.

95
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,062
That's how you knew
about her money problems?

96
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,378
She said her family let her down.

97
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,547
That could've been JP.
Maybe JP promised and let her down.

98
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,299
I don't know, all right? She lost a lot.

99
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,719
Yeah, which would give her...
motive, Matthew!

100
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:11,222
No, I don't want to talk about it,
all right? It's done. We're done.

101
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,141
Okay... Is she...
- It's none of my business, Tom.

102
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,601
Hey, hey, hey.

103
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:16,770
Fuck!

104
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,648
Shit!

105
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,154
Will you slow down a bit?

106
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,530
Why won't you answer me?

107
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:31,117
I don't wanna talk about
John Paul anymore, okay? It's enough.

108
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,244
We have to.

109
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:36,373
Oscar's dead, Bibi.
And he did nothing wrong.

110
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,333
He was a good dog.

111
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:41,086
He had a permanent hard-on,
and he pissed everywhere.

112
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,880
Yeah, around you, you scary bitch.

113
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,258
Can it breathe in there?

114
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,552
Yeah, think so.

115
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,179
Hello.

116
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,140
Yeah, a kitten
will make everyone happy again.

117
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,225
Yeah, not JP.

118
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,561
Did Urs text you back?

119
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,732
No.
- No?

120
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,318
That's not like her. Give her a call.

121
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,866
What have you told Becka?
- Nothing.

122
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,410
I'm not gonna tell her anything either.

123
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,411
Don't want her involved.

124
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,206
Yeah, of course. She'd fuck it up.

125
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,125
No answer.
- Not because she'll fuck it up.

126
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,919
Because she wouldn't be able to handle it.

127
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,130
Could we speed it up?

128
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:27,424
I mean, my heart has stopped
from going so slow.

129
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,926
What? I thought we were going on a stroll.

130
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:33,095
I thought it was a stroll. Bibi.

131
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,849
Come on, you lazy bitch.
We'll be late!

132
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:36,933
Gonna get the car.

133
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,854
So, each therapist
will be shadowed by a trainee

134
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,525
that will essentially be paying
that therapist's wage,

135
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,609
through their training fees.

136
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,320
Fresh out of the oven. Sorry.

137
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,532
I've worked it all out and
we'd agree to a rate of interest.

138
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,950
Beat the bank sort of thing.

139
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,119
The ones on the bottom
have apricots in them.

140
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:59,080
Thanks, Grace.
- We are working here, love.

141
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,374
Thank you.
- Sorry.

142
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:05,712
So, my financial ask
is actually very modest,

143
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,923
especially for a space like that
in a location like that.

144
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,843
So you're finally growing up.

145
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,888
Yeah. Well, I know that everybody thinks
that I'm the family screwup,

146
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:18,475
but I'm doing it. And I've got a website
that's almost ready to go.

147
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,561
And all of my reviews are so good.

148
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,021
Well, they're mainly good.

149
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,566
And I had time to help your mom.
- What?

150
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,236
Yeah. It's no trouble.
Her hip's actually improving.

151
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,281
But we've got a professional on call.

152
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:36,618
Well, it's a pleasure to help.
- You need to focus on your premises.

153
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,161
You're going to be busy.

154
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,913
Are you saying...
- What is that quote?

155
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:43,166
"As long as you're going
to be thinking anyway, think big."

156
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,211
Are you thinking big?
- Yes! So...

157
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,338
So?
- Are you in?

158
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,924
I'm on board. Yeah, you know.
- That is so good.

159
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,635
This is so exciting.

160
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Yay!

161
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,432
Oh, my God. Cute. Quick!
- We knew you had to be together.

162
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,017
Look what they brought me.

163
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,685
Look at you!

164
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,938
She's from all her aunties.
We just thought,

165
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,357
after what happened with Oscar...
- Hang on a second.

166
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,651
It'd be nice to be asked.
- You can't just come wal...

167
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:14,405
Cats are a walk in the park, JP.
They look after themselves.

168
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:17,033
Can we, John, please?
Look at his paws.

169
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,786
Please, Daddy. Please?
- You can keep him.

170
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:21,621
You're so cute.

171
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,373
Thanks, Dad.
- Hey!

172
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,793
Thanks, Auntie Eva and Bibi.

173
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,504
And Auntie Becka.

174
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:30,839
I'm off for my run, finally.

175
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,715
Never exercise with the elderly.

176
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,009
Oi! Watch it.

177
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,512
Bye.

178
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,431
I'll catch up with you soon.
- Thanks, darling.

179
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,351
I'm gonna call him Harry
after Harry Styles.

180
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:46,813
Come on. Come on in to your new home.

181
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:49,191
Yeah. Come on, Harry.

182
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:57,532
Your youngest sister was in there,
on her knees, begging me for money.

183
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:01,202
Meanwhile, you're out here, splashing
cash on kittens nobody's asked for.

184
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,246
Kitten cost nine euro.

185
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:04,998
See you at the work quiz, Eva.

186
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,583
Cannot wait.

187
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,502
Take it seriously
if you want Gerald to take you seriously.

188
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:12,548
At least give me a fair fight
for the promotion, will you?

189
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,425
Cock.

190
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,931
Leave it.

191
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,976
JP again. Jesus.

192
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,352
What does he want?
- Don't know,

193
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,855
but I know I have no time
for his shite tonight.

194
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,232
All right. See you in the morning.

195
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,151
Bye, kids.
- Bye.

196
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,195
Love you.
- Love you too.

197
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,280
Okay, so...

198
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:43,996
It's Roger.

199
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,130
For God's sake.

200
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:59,177
Hope you don't mind me
coming around this way. It was... I guess...

201
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,638
I don't think JP heard me
knocking the door.

202
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:04,307
That stinks.
- Razor clams.

203
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:06,935
Not the prettiest name in the world,
but I hope you enjoy them.

204
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,770
You're very good, Roger.

205
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,563
Becka, tell him your news.

206
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,525
I'm opening a massage studio.
- Congratulations.

207
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,696
Tell you what? You could have Gracie
front the house with her lovely manners.

208
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,074
What is this?

209
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,701
We're just telling Roger
about your investment.

210
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,620
It's actually not a bad idea, Grace.

211
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:28,623
I haven't worked anywhere in yonks.
I wouldn't know the jargon.

212
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:30,041
There's no jargon.

213
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:32,460
Just welcome the people.
Manage the appointments.

214
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,587
You'd be amazing, Grace. Amazing Grace.

215
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,589
Like the song.

216
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,674
I don't know.

217
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,177
What do you think, John Paul?

218
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,138
Grace runs our home.

219
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,350
Right. Well, I'll leave yous lads to it.

220
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,478
I'm heading off for a residential weekend
with my wee church group.

221
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,522
Have fun.

222
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,232
Thank you.
- Thanks for the razors, Roger.

223
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,317
Sure.

224
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:02,092
I got a medical journal
from the library,

225
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:05,845
and apparently, if you cut the aorta,
you'll be done within 90 seconds, so...

226
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:10,391
Jesus Christ, Bibi. I don't wanna hear
the ins and outs of garroting someone.

227
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:15,021
Why? Because it's not happening, okay?

228
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:18,817
It was one moment of madness.
Two moments of madness.

229
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:21,403
And that's it. It's over. It's done.

230
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,030
Right, Urs?

231
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,407
Urs?

232
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,451
I was just saying this whole thing
with John Paul, it...

233
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,245
Jesus Christ! Just stop talking about him.

234
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,789
I don't wanna hear his name anymore,
all right?

235
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:37,168
And I can't believe I'm an accomplice
to an attempted murder, and for what?

236
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:39,170
Your CV.
- Oh, fuck off, Bibi.

237
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:41,798
Let's take it back
to the old-school, lads!

238
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,513
You've already started.
Didn't know we were meeting up.

239
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:50,265
Rude.
- Oh, no. It's not like that.

240
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:52,308
Bibi was just waiting for Nora,
and Urs is...

241
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:55,938
Well, I wanted your opinion
on paint swatches because...

242
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,816
I just signed the lease on my studio!

243
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,989
Hello?
- Right. So JP's given you the loan?

244
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,324
Yeah. He believes I can do this.

245
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,035
Well, go talk paint with him then.

246
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:17,041
You know what? I'm confused as to why I'm
getting more support from JP than you lot.

247
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,169
Do you not believe in me?
- Yeah, we do...

248
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,379
Then what's this?

249
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,256
Secret craic without me?

250
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,424
Buying Blanaid sneaky kittens?

251
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,843
We're just concerned that
you're taking too much from him, okay?

252
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,011
Because he can be very...

253
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,554
Evil.
- unreliable.

254
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:30,930
You know, I like the pink.

255
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,308
It's more your color,
and it will suit your skin tone.

256
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:35,143
Your piggy skin tone.
- Piss off, Bibi.

257
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,687
Can you just stop?
Just stop, okay. Let's celebrate.

258
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:40,815
Let's just celebrate the... your business.

259
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:43,277
Good? And the studio.

260
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:46,863
And you.
- To the business and Becka.

261
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:49,032
Business and Becka. <i>Sláinte</i>.
<i>- Sláinte.</i>

262
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:53,161
Urs, you're, like, deadly quiet.
It's giving me the creeps.

263
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:55,455
I'm not quiet. I'm hormonal.

264
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,417
I'm up for having fun and sisterly chats.

265
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:01,670
And drinking. I'm up for drinking.

266
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,716
So go on then. Hit me with it.
What's the craic? What's the goss, huh?

267
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,968
Are you going to shag your man?

268
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:10,929
What?
- Gabriel.

269
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:14,766
I don't know.
It's hard to gauge the signals.

270
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,851
What signals? Just shag him, Eva.

271
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:19,646
Yeah, 'cause it's that easy, isn't it?
- It literally is.

272
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,981
You're a ride. You deserve to get ridden.

273
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,358
Let Gabriel ride you.

274
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:25,985
I'm going.
- That's my...

275
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,695
That's actually real champagne, Becka.

276
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:30,657
You leave me out of everything,
I take your champagne.

277
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:31,992
Quid pro quo.

278
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:33,994
Well, look. Don't be like...

279
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,954
Becka.

280
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,254
What do you think, should I?

281
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,840
Ride him?
- No, ask him out.

282
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:48,550
Probably not.
- Why?

283
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,929
Oh, God, thanks for the pep talk.

284
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,019
Thank you, fine sir!

285
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:29,842
Coming!

286
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:36,806
And this photo's John Paul
when he was just 12 years old.

287
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:37,891
With his frog.

288
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:40,852
John Paul loved frogs.

289
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:43,856
He'd give them names,
then drown them in milk.

290
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:49,570
I found seven different glasses of milk
with dead frogs under his bed.

291
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:52,739
George.

292
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,784
He didn't stuff amphibians, you see.

293
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,828
He thought the frogs were vulgar.

294
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:02,123
But your brother, he loved frogs, Laura.

295
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,542
It's Becka.

296
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,422
Is this Laura?

297
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:11,258
Sorry. This is my daughter.

298
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:14,427
They're her best dungarees.

299
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,680
And her cat, Miso.

300
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,808
But she's gone now.

301
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,732
Is she coming back? Like George.

302
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,736
I'm afraid Laura is not coming back.

303
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:34,907
I'm sorry, Minna.

304
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:39,286
I have to piss like a Russian racehorse.

305
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,590
What the hell, JP?

306
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,927
This is how you run your sessions?

307
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,846
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

308
00:18:58,597 --> 00:18:59,598
JP.

309
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:02,225
Looks like a lovely afternoon.

310
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:04,602
I know you said that
she already has a physio, but I just...

311
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:07,480
Yeah, it's no problem. I just
don't want to pay for the care twice.

312
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:10,359
We were just chatting.
I love coming to see her.

313
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,486
Me too.

314
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:15,656
I'll leave you to it.

315
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:22,996
Bye, Min!

316
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:30,879
For Christ's sake.

317
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,061
Look.

318
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:57,030
"Gin later?"
"Does anybody have ibuprofen?"

319
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:58,782
"I'm hemorrhaging here."

320
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,200
Hemorrhaging?

321
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:02,076
Jesus, you girls need a priest.

322
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:06,206
Do you ever talk about novels? Politics?

323
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,709
You need to be on it, Grace, for the quiz.

324
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:11,753
Periods and gin isn't going to cut it.

325
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:14,381
I will be. It's just sister chat.

326
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,509
I know we're a bit much sometimes.

327
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,263
Becka's the happiest I've seen her
in a long while.

328
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:25,934
She won't let you down. She'll pay
the cash back in no time like she said.

329
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,228
I can't give Becka money.

330
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,232
What?

331
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:35,986
Why not?
- Well, I never said I would.

332
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,446
She must have misunderstood.

333
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:40,907
I mean, she needs to build her own life,
doesn't she?

334
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:42,075
But I thought you...

335
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:44,828
You said...

336
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:46,663
She signed the lease, JP.

337
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,665
Well, she must have got help
somewhere else.

338
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:52,627
I mean, she is a very well-connected lady.

339
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:54,045
No, you said you'd help.

340
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:56,548
I mentored her.

341
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,633
And she misunderstood.

342
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:02,095
Will you just pop round and let her know
she's got her wires crossed?

343
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,598
You're much better at that kind of thing.

344
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,183
Thank you.

345
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:08,977
I can't.

346
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:11,855
This means a lot to her.

347
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:16,068
She's taking advantage
of your kindness, Mammy.

348
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,489
She misunderstood.

349
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,560
Your hair looks nice. Come in.

350
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:54,106
Hot chocolates from Starlings with
a bit of chili in it, like you like it.

351
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,941
You're an angel.

352
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:02,656
We can't give you the money.

353
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:07,369
What do you mean?

354
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,079
JP, he...

355
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,667
We can't fund the massage studio.

356
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:15,961
The loan, we can't.

357
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:18,838
I don't get it. Why? What happened?

358
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,801
Well, JP says he never actually said
he'd help you financially.

359
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,554
Excuse me?

360
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,348
It was more of an advice session.

361
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:33,269
Am I on drugs?

362
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,398
You were there, Grace.
You know he was into it.

363
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:40,819
I'm meeting the estate agent tomorrow
to pay for the second installment.

364
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:43,571
I put the first half
on a bloody high-interest credit card.

365
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:44,656
Becka, please.

366
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,075
He has to help me.
You have to talk to him.

367
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:48,326
Look, I don't know what's...

368
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:50,245
We could help you out
in other ways with it.

369
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,747
We could come in...
- I'm broke! I signed a lease! I...

370
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:55,667
I don't need him to rub down clients.
I need the money.

371
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,753
I'm so sorry.

372
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,797
Why would he make you tell me?

373
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:04,760
I mean, that's demented.

374
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,389
This is messed up, Grace.

375
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:13,101
I mean, don't you think
that this is so off...

376
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:17,064
I think it's just a misunderstanding.

377
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:39,711
Fergal!

378
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,131
Fergal Loftus.

379
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:44,632
Who is this clown?

380
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:47,135
Thomas Claffin.
We were due to meet earlier.

381
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:50,263
I stood at Claire's Accessories
for 55 minutes waiting for you.

382
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:51,264
You didn't come.

383
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:53,433
Yeah.
I was called to a triple murder in Dalkey.

384
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:55,894
Yeah, apologies for keeping you waiting.

385
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:58,688
Apology accepted.
Now can we just get on with it?

386
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:01,691
Fergal is golfing, insurance man.
- I wasn't talking to you.

387
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:04,068
If you want to speak to me,
you call my office, all right?

388
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,613
People are staring.
You're clearly not dressed for golf.

389
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,533
I told the receptionist
a pretty horrible lie

390
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:11,951
to get in here to talk to you,

391
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,830
so I'm not leaving
till I've said what I have to say.

392
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:19,918
Jesus Christ. Make it quick.
- Right.

393
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:26,966
Fire in the cabin.
The car accident at the hotel.

394
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:29,007
See, there's too many claims.
Too many coincidences.

395
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,347
Well, I can do nothing
without actual evidence.

396
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:33,890
And without proper procedure.

397
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:35,309
I told you, the widow signed.

398
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,728
She wants this to happen. Why don't you?

399
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,690
Now, why would she put herself
through something like that?

400
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:48,197
Having a body exhumed, picked apart,
is agony for a grieving family.

401
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:50,198
Why did she sign?

402
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:53,327
She obviously feels something is off.

403
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:56,246
Something is off.

404
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:01,292
And I'm presuming the local Gardaí found
nothing suspicious about this man's death.

405
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:03,086
Not as such,
but they haven't the...

406
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:06,714
No.

407
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:08,133
I'm not going to exhume a body

408
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:10,886
every time an insurance firm
doesn't want to pay out.

409
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:14,973
Because as far as I can see,
you have got nothing.

410
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:17,851
Can you believe this guy?

411
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,270
He told the receptionist
his daughter's been kidnapped.

412
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:22,523
He doesn't even
have golf shoes on.

413
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:29,238
Tom.

414
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:36,035
Tom, can we please go home now?
This is all getting a bit much.

415
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:37,371
Fore!

416
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:41,791
Did you even go to the pub?

417
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:42,876
What pub?

418
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,086
Jesus. The pub.

419
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:47,464
To check if JP was actually there
the night he died.

420
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:50,091
Oh, right. Yeah, I did.
I talked to the barmaid.

421
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:52,302
JP ate all the free sandwiches,

422
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:55,263
he kept to himself,
tried to get money off his bill.

423
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:57,348
That's it.
- So, nothing. Again!

424
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:58,892
Jesus, I can't keep doing this.

425
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:00,561
Well, we could just stop.

426
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:04,522
You know,
and declare bankruptcy and start again.

427
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:06,108
Stop? There is no stop, Matt.

428
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,694
I haven't slept a full night in weeks.

429
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:11,613
Can't hear anything
my wife says to me anymore.

430
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:13,907
All I hear is,
"Don't blow your lives up, Thomas!

431
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:16,743
Don't blow it all up!"
- There's no need for this. It's mad.

432
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:19,287
Look, Matt.

433
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:20,372
What?

434
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:23,166
Just, I can't do this on my own.

435
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:29,255
H...

436
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:30,924
You're still talking to her?
- No.

437
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:32,884
Just stay out of it.
- We need information.

438
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:36,012
I'm up against the wall, and you can help
knock it down for me, Matt.

439
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:37,722
No. Please don't ask me, Tom. No.

440
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:39,390
You know her five minutes.
I'm your brother.

441
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:41,267
You're asking me to use Becka
to get to the sisters?

442
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:43,228
No. Look at me.

443
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:45,772
I am desperate here. I am desperate.

444
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:48,442
Help me.

445
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:25,354
Excuse me!

446
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,988
Hiya, Blanaid!

447
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:39,451
Blanaid, hiya!

448
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:43,288
Yeah, well. I should...

449
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,760
Wow. A little fist pump.

450
00:27:56,844 --> 00:28:00,889
You happy? Good news?
- No. I was punching the air in grief.

451
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:03,100
She's also sardonic. I love it.

452
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:05,769
Excuse me.

453
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:06,978
Yeah.

454
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:08,063
Thank you.

455
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:11,525
No. I just saved the company 50K
on the Henderson deal, so...

456
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:13,485
Gerald just high-fived me.

457
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:16,237
I mean, he missed,
and it was extremely awkward,

458
00:28:16,238 --> 00:28:20,283
but I've never seen him do that before.
So, basically, I'm a bad bitch, Gabriel.

459
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:21,910
Yeah, you are. You're brilliant.

460
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,872
Let's go out for lunch.
- Yeah?

461
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,207
Yeah. Yes.

462
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:31,711
Because I saw you drinking
from the third-floor tap yesterday.

463
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:34,464
And that shit's yellow, so, you know,
you clearly haven't got a clue.

464
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:37,842
You need someone to show you the ropes.
And by ropes, I mean pubs.

465
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:39,970
Okay. I won't argue with that.

466
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:43,307
Yeah?
- Yeah, I'll come to your desk at 12:30.

467
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:46,059
Okay, cool. Coo...

468
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:48,270
Oh, my God.

469
00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:56,695
Becka. I asked him out.

470
00:28:58,322 --> 00:29:01,699
I just said it.
You know, like a woman in an ad.

471
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,826
So, we're going out.

472
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:04,912
He's distractingly good-looking.

473
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:11,919
No. I screwed it up.

474
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:14,338
Okay, okay. Hang on.

475
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:16,005
No smiling.

476
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:17,090
Okay.

477
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:31,938
What?

478
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:34,774
I can't believe
JP is married to your sister.

479
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:38,111
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.
- Yeah.

480
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:41,448
I don't know if I could listen
to racist, misogynistic shit

481
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:44,076
spewing out of his thin lips
on my days off.

482
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:47,078
I'm so sorry, that just came out.
He's your family.

483
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,872
Yeah, that man's not my family.

484
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:52,375
You know they just made
the first-floor toilets gender-neutral?

485
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:55,045
Oh, yeah.
- Well, he stole a cubicle.

486
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:56,880
He did what?

487
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:58,799
What?

488
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,301
He made a little sign
for one of the cubicles saying,

489
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:03,720
"Men only. JP Williams's cubicle."
- Oh, my God.

490
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:04,888
"Do not enter."

491
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:06,557
Shut up!
- Yeah.

492
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:10,393
Obviously, someone just took
the sign down, but what the hell?

493
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:11,645
With his little sharpie.

494
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:15,148
John Paul's toilet.

495
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:18,109
Yeah.

496
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,028
I don't know why I'm laughing, honestly.

497
00:30:20,946 --> 00:30:22,655
He asked every single man in the office

498
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:24,783
to be his partner
for the table quiz tonight.

499
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:28,120
I told him I'd prefer to partner with you.

500
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:31,372
Yeah.

501
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:33,125
Well, I'm partnering with my sister.

502
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:34,626
Sorry, babe.

503
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:36,420
It's just you and JP.

504
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:39,006
Yeah. I would rather lick a bus.

505
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:42,300
Wow.
- Good, right?

506
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:44,344
Yeah.
- Yeah!

507
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:46,555
I just heard a girl saying that
in a supermarket.

508
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:49,600
That's so cute.

509
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:54,479
You have the best laugh I've ever heard.

510
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:56,356
Stop.
- No.

511
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,734
My sisters say I sound
like a van reversing.

512
00:30:59,318 --> 00:31:00,318
Like a what?

513
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,403
Like a...

514
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:05,199
Like a van. Like a van reversing.

515
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:20,464
Love, why did you...

516
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:23,550
What, Mom?

517
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:27,053
Bla, you blanked me today in town.

518
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:28,263
I didn't see you.

519
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:29,431
No?
- No.

520
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:32,893
I did see you. I saw you.

521
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,229
Well, I know you did. I saw you see me.

522
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,399
Can you just stand up, Mom? Like, please.

523
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:42,402
I'm cleaning the bathroom floor, Blanaid.
Someone has to.

524
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:43,778
You never just stand up!

525
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:46,573
I am standing up.
- You never do anything!

526
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:49,535
Well, that's not strictly true, is it?
- Sadie's mom does pole dancing.

527
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:52,204
She has unbelievable core strength.

528
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:55,832
And Donncha's mom
is a human rights lawyer.

529
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:58,460
Like, she saves lives with her brain.

530
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:00,838
You're just here all the time.

531
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:03,423
Ouch.

532
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:08,052
I'm not saying you're useless.
- Well, that's good then. That's lovely.

533
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:10,514
Just, you were going to
maybe work for Auntie Beck.

534
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:12,891
And now you just, what, give up?

535
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,811
Sorry.

536
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:17,896
I didn't mean...
- No, it's fine.

537
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,606
God, sorry! Okay?

538
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:29,074
What?

539
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:39,626
Ursula!

540
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,211
Jesus!

541
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:44,882
Bring back my shoe, hon.

542
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:51,763
Hi.
- What are you doing? You don't run.

543
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:54,558
Yeah. No. I don't.

544
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:58,228
Demented way to spend your time.

545
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:02,316
Are you drinking? It's only lunch time.

546
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:04,735
My life is in tatters.

547
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,528
What's happened?

548
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:10,949
John Paul.

549
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,327
He lied to me, Ursula.

550
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:15,662
He's not gonna give me the money.

551
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:18,957
Was he getting
some kind of perverse pleasure

552
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,543
out of watching me do cartwheels
to impress him?

553
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:23,795
Prick.

554
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:29,051
Urs?

555
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:31,386
What's up?

556
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:33,847
I cheated on Donal.

557
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:36,141
Oh, my God. When?

558
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:38,685
Last night?

559
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:42,397
No, not last night.

560
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:43,482
When?

561
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:45,900
Ursula. Donal is so sweet.

562
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:47,610
That's not helpful.

563
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:50,322
Well, when did you do it?
- It's been going on a while.

564
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:52,616
Quite a while.

565
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:55,202
Shit.

566
00:33:57,371 --> 00:33:58,622
Hang on, who knows?

567
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:00,374
Eva and Bibi.

568
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:02,876
Everyone except me, basically.

569
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,380
And Grace. I didn't want to tell anyone.
It's not really the point.

570
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:11,009
So, everyone knows this huge thing,
and I'm on the outside again?

571
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:13,344
No. I can't.

572
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,806
Oh, my God. Don't be so selfish, Becka.

573
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:21,353
Seriously? That's rich.

574
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:30,904
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

575
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:36,284
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm an asshole.

576
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:37,369
I'm sorry.

577
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:41,456
It's not so bad.

578
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:45,293
Donal doesn't know. You could fix this.

579
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:47,420
It's not just that.

580
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,047
There's more.

581
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:54,719
It's the prick.

582
00:34:57,556 --> 00:34:59,390
Okay, okay.

583
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:02,310
The annual Fisher & Co. pub quiz
must now come

584
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:04,813
to its inevitable, horrifying conclusion.

585
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:10,485
Now, in the last round,
we had to say goodbye, <i>au revoir</i>, adieu

586
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:13,197
to the stunning Gabriel.

587
00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:15,865
Everybody say "aw."
- <i>Au revoir.</i>

588
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:17,242
I love him so...

589
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:18,743
And his basic partner, of course. What?

590
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:25,542
But this next round
is the "name that song" round.

591
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:27,419
Yes! I'm so good at this. I swear.

592
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:28,920
Focus, Grace.
- One of you...

593
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:32,382
is going to hum the song. No lyrics!
- It's hot.

594
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:35,177
And the other one is going to guess, okay?

595
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:37,679
Definitely okay.

596
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:39,139
Go, Gracie!

597
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:40,557
At this stage...
- You ready?

598
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:43,161
We only have two teams remaining...
- I am. I'm focused, I promise.

599
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,269
In the competition.

600
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:51,026
The beautiful Bibi and Eva
and, of course, JP and the amazing Grace.

601
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:58,366
But to hold the winner's trophy aloft,
it all comes down to this final round.

602
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:00,410
Eva, are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

603
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:01,578
Here is a song.

604
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:03,222
Okay. Can I see...
- Here's a microphone.

605
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:06,040
Please hum that tune!
- All right.

606
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:08,460
Can't hear you down the back!

607
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:11,046
Literally just clearing my throat. Okay.

608
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:13,423
You ready?
- Yep.

609
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:16,551
Frank Sinatra!

610
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:22,140
"Dirty Old Town."

611
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:23,600
Yes!

612
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:27,937
Gorgeous. Congratulations. Well done.
- Thank you.

613
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:31,483
So, it's over to you, beautiful.
You ready?

614
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:34,110
Here we go. Right.
- Here's your song.

615
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:37,155
Take that microphone. Hum that song!

616
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:40,325
You know this one. It's gonna be so easy.
Yeah, here we go.

617
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,663
Britney Spears!

618
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:47,540
Oh, my God.

619
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:48,625
Shut up.

620
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:56,466
Do you know it?

621
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:04,433
Try the second verse.
- Think of our wedding.

622
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,520
Try a different verse, perhaps?
- Listen, listen.

623
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:11,690
Come on, JP!

624
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:16,361
Oh, come on, Grace!
Nobody's getting it! Come on.

625
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:18,864
Yeah, we are.
- Well, we all get it.

626
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,413
Sing it, Grace.

627
00:37:27,456 --> 00:37:29,457
Sing it for Christ's sake! Just...

628
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:31,793
Time is up.

629
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:35,797
And the winners are
the beautiful Bibi and Eva!

630
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:43,873
We haven't had this much fun
since last year's annual quiz.

631
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:47,142
What the bloody hell was that?
- I nearly sang the whole song, JP.

632
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:49,102
It's pathetic.

633
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,688
You embarrassed me.

634
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:08,788
Want some more?
'Cause I know you love shitty...

635
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:10,582
of champagne...
- Yeah.

636
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,208
You tacky cunt.

637
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:13,835
Loser spoils for the loser.

638
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:15,754
Happy to let the girls win, Gerald.

639
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:18,381
You all right?

640
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:21,885
Yeah, just a little bit worried about Eva.
That's her seventh gin.

641
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,596
Seventh? Jesus.

642
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:28,475
I don't want to hassle her,

643
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:31,144
but I'd like to get her in a cab
before she regrets anything.

644
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:35,440
Here comes trouble.

645
00:38:35,524 --> 00:38:36,566
I need to talk to you.

646
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,943
Well, hello.
- We should get you a 7 Up.

647
00:38:38,944 --> 00:38:41,696
I don't want a drink. I wanna talk.
- Excuse me?

648
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:43,448
Or we could talk here if you want.

649
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:47,452
Sister problems, Gerald. Sorry.

650
00:38:54,293 --> 00:38:57,337
This is my work.
We don't play with my work.

651
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:59,005
Ever, Rebe... Ev...

652
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:00,465
You're sick.

653
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:02,759
Lower your voice.

654
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:04,010
I'm warning you.

655
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:06,429
Maggoty piece of shit!
- I'm warning you!

656
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,348
Shut your mouth!

657
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:10,934
Hey! What the fuck? Get off her!

658
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:13,561
You're a bastard! You're a bastard!
- Well, I just...

659
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:15,355
I tried to calm her down.
- That's enough.

660
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:17,065
Becka, let's get you a drink.

661
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:20,736
She doesn't need to drink. She's a wreck.
- No, I'm not a wreck. I'm angry.

662
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,364
And that doesn't make me mad,
or drunk, or hysterical.

663
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:26,074
That just makes me angry!

664
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:27,283
Okay, B.

665
00:39:27,284 --> 00:39:30,411
You don't know what he did.
Don't defend him, you hate him!

666
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:33,706
I'm the one who always said he was okay,
but he is not okay.

667
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:35,834
What he did to Urs is sick!

668
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:38,587
Please just not here.

669
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:41,632
You can go.
- Thanks, cyclops.

670
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:50,098
What is going on?
- He's trying to ruin us.

671
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:52,308
We need to call the guards.
- What happened, Becka?

672
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:54,185
Not that the guards
ever do anything about this.

673
00:39:54,186 --> 00:39:56,563
But we can't just do nothing!
- Becka, what did he do?

674
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:57,648
He...

675
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:02,110
I think she should tell you herself.

676
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:10,494
I took the picture for Ben.

677
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:15,123
But I sent it to JP's phone.

678
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:16,208
What?

679
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:20,295
He made himself Ben in my phone.

680
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:26,551
And I told him, "This pussy is yours."

681
00:40:26,552 --> 00:40:28,928
Jesus!
- It's a quote from a book.

682
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:30,722
It doesn't matter where... Just...

683
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:32,974
I know I shouldn't have been
messing around with Ben

684
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:35,059
behind Donal's back. It was weak of me.

685
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,811
Why are you saying that? It's not...

686
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:39,063
Listen to me, Ursula Garvey.

687
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:41,232
This is about that perverted prick.

688
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:42,526
Okay? It's on him!

689
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:47,698
It's not safe in general
to send pictures of your pussy.

690
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:51,034
Nothing's ever really encrypted.
- Don't shame her.

691
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:53,745
That's your fecking vulva,
you can do what you want with it.

692
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:54,829
She's right.

693
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,248
She is. To be fair.

694
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:00,294
I can't cope anymore.

695
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:02,880
I just don't know what he's gonna do next.

696
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:05,841
I can't even spend proper time
with the kids.

697
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:08,244
So what... So what are we gonna do?

698
00:41:08,927 --> 00:41:10,637
Are we just gonna allow this to happen?

699
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:14,599
I mean, he's ruining people's lives!
He should be fucking underground!

700
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,975
Well...

701
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:17,769
Bibi!
- No, I'm sorry.

702
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:20,355
But he messed Ursula up.

703
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:22,774
He promised me a loan
and then just binned me off.

704
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:24,442
I mean, he screwed me.

705
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:27,070
And Grace is so lost these days.

706
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:29,864
I mean, she just lets him rewrite reality.

707
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:34,536
And nods along like,
"Did he? Sorry, you misunderstood."

708
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,751
Stay here.

709
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:45,881
Well, where's she going?

710
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:53,555
Come to the front door.

711
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:00,854
Eva. What a nice surprise.

712
00:42:01,605 --> 00:42:02,981
Hey!
- No!

713
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:05,859
No.

714
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:11,322
Give me that!
- No!

715
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:13,199
Give me that!

716
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,242
You lunatic!

717
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:17,412
Have you it saved somewhere else?
Have you the photo saved anywhere...

718
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:20,123
Hey!

719
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:22,709
Hi.
- Auntie Eva.

720
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:24,294
What's up? It's so late.

721
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:28,256
Yeah, I thought I left my keys here so...

722
00:42:28,257 --> 00:42:31,342
Eejit. But I hadn't so,
I'm gonna head off.

723
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:33,386
But I'll see you on Thursday, right?

724
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:35,346
For the cinema.
- Yeah. Okay.

725
00:42:35,347 --> 00:42:37,849
Okay. Okay, dote. Bye.
- Bye.

726
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:38,850
Bye.

727
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:05,002
Fuck.

728
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:48,462
I want in. I wanna help.

729
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,341
No.

730
00:43:53,008 --> 00:43:55,928
No way.
- You're pushing me out, Eva.

731
00:43:57,513 --> 00:44:00,473
You're not being my mom,
or my sister, or my friend.

732
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:03,893
Fine if I'm not being any of those things,
but I'm not gonna stop protecting you...

733
00:44:03,894 --> 00:44:05,770
You're not protecting me!
- because that is my job!

734
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:08,732
You're isolating me.
- I don't even know why I'm having to...

735
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:14,779
What we're doing, it's really, really bad.

736
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,073
No, it's not.

737
00:44:17,783 --> 00:44:18,867
It's survival.

738
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:23,664
Someone's not coming out
the other side of this.

739
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:26,333
And it's not gonna be me.

740
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:30,587
And it sure as shit is
not gonna be one of my sisters.

741
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:38,804
Let me in, Eva.

742
00:44:49,398 --> 00:44:50,399
Okay.

743
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:31,773
Come on.

744
00:45:31,857 --> 00:45:33,585
Theresa will eat me
if I don't bring food up.

745
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:36,653
Yeah...
She's texting me again. Gimme a sec.

746
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:39,531
I'll follow you up.

747
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:41,074
Just do what you gotta do.

748
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:19,363
Sorry.
- Please.

749
00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:21,615
Thanks for letting me in.

750
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:24,701
What? So, you're just...
You're stalking me now?

751
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:26,286
I just wanted to clear this up.

752
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:30,707
You think I'm some kind of vixen liar,
and I'm not.

753
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,876
Well, what do you expect? You lied.

754
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,879
Not lies. Just misunderstandings.

755
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:39,675
I didn't know you were a Claffin.
- I didn't know you were a Garvey.

756
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:42,260
Information was withheld.

757
00:46:42,261 --> 00:46:45,389
I didn't say my last name, that's all.

758
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,641
You told me you were a bassist.
- I am...

759
00:46:48,642 --> 00:46:49,934
I am a bassist.

760
00:46:49,935 --> 00:46:53,021
Insurance is your hobby or so is it?
- I just... I can't handle lies.

761
00:46:53,105 --> 00:46:55,524
I can't handle controlling men.
- I'm not controlling.

762
00:46:56,817 --> 00:46:58,277
I'm not trying to be.

763
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:03,073
I don't wanna fight with you.

764
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:04,658
No?

765
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:08,328
Well, then why are you here?

766
00:47:15,294 --> 00:47:18,338
Why did you spray half a bottle of Joop
on yourself before you let me in?

767
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:20,173
It's not Joop.
- It 100% is Joop.

768
00:47:20,174 --> 00:47:21,466
Okay, it's Joop.

769
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:38,817
You have to go, Becka.

770
00:47:43,822 --> 00:47:47,618
I know you want this.
- I can't. I can't do this.

771
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:49,453
I'm not gonna beg.

772
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,841
Matt.

773
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,428
I'm sorry. No. You have to go.
