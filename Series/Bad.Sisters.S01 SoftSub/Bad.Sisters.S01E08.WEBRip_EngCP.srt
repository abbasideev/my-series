1
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,102
Ah.

2
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,107
What is it?

3
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,985
It's a polar bear.

4
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,572
No, I meant where... where'd you get it?

5
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,448
Balbriggan Road.

6
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,619
Best spot in Dublin for roadkill.
Isn't that what you always say?

7
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,372
They drive like lunatics
around there.

8
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,374
You never come down here.

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,919
You always say my animals
give you nightmares.

10
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,130
Well,
I was actually looking to, um,

11
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,758
uh, borrow a bit of money.

12
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,095
Not much, uh, just a f... a few thousand.

13
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,682
Well, I would say a few thousand
is not much for me,

14
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,811
but for you…
…it's a fortune, no?

15
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,522
Yeah…
…it's just that, uh...

16
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,531
Yeah, I was going to say we've had
a... a lot of expenses,

17
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,294
what with Blanaid and the new school and...

18
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,493
When was the last time
you visited your mother?

19
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,955
What? Just now. I just saw her upstairs.

20
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,749
You came to ask for money,
not to see Minna.

21
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:26,211
God knows what would become of her
if anything happened to me.

22
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:30,215
- Well, she'd be looked after.
- By you?

23
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,388
Her mind is going.

24
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,516
Every week I lose
a little bit more of her.

25
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,645
And all she ever says is,
"When will JP come?"

26
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,606
I have my own family now.

27
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,482
You never forgave her, did you?

28
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:50,360
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Come on.

29
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,364
She dressed you in your sister's clothes.

30
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:59,036
It can't be a happy memory.
Or maybe you liked it?

31
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,582
So, are you gonna give me
the money or not?

32
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,501
No.

33
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,055
Ah, fucking hell.

34
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,267
Dad!

35
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,438
Dad! Dad!

36
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:28,941
Dad! Dad!

37
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,445
Dad.

38
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,437
I'm telling you, he's in the freezer.

39
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,648
- There's no way.
- You don't believe me?

40
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,776
No, but Grace said
that George walked out on her.

41
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,671
- He couldn't cope with Minna's dementia.
- That's just what JP told her.

42
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,113
Right, so how did he die?

43
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,406
Isn't it obvious?

44
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,911
- Oh, f…
- Oh. No way.

45
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,207
No. John Paul is not a killer.

46
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,393
Uh, there's a time I would have said
the same about us.

47
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,177
Yeah, but why would he
murder his own father?

48
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,380
Oh, why do you think? Money.

49
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,590
George is dead. Minna inherits everything.

50
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,634
Yeah, exactly. So, how would that have...

51
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,637
Well, as long as everyone
thinks he's alive,

52
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,015
- JP can spend his money as he wants.
- Fu…

53
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,643
Maybe... Maybe it was an accident?

54
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,019
If it was an accident,

55
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,856
then why would he hold onto the body
for how many years?

56
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,900
I mean, he keeps it in a drawer
in his freezer room.

57
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,696
He goes to check on it every Friday night
after he drops off Minna's shopping.

58
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,282
I mean, he's a sick bastard.

59
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,993
Wait a minute.

60
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,745
Then we have him, right?

61
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,163
Have him how?

62
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,833
Well, all we'd have to do now is
ring the Guards.

63
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,711
One phone call,
and he's out of Grace's life forever.

64
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,171
No.

65
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,674
Well, he won't be out of Grace's life.

66
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,197
Not as long as he's still breathing.

67
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,095
Yeah, but he won't have control
over her, will he? Not if he's inside.

68
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,139
What, and you think
the minute he's sent down,

69
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:51,310
Grace is gonna be going to Connolly's
disco night for mature singles with you?

70
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:52,895
No offense.

71
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,354
None taken.

72
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,857
She'll stand by him.

73
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,903
There'll be a trial, then an appeal,
and it will go on and on and on,

74
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:05,073
and even if he does get a sentence,
she'll wait for him.

75
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:09,036
Or he'll say it was Minna who killed him.
I wouldn't put it past him.

76
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,263
Jesus, he might even kill her

77
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,473
when he realizes it's cheaper
than putting her in a home.

78
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,624
Calm down, Becka.

79
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:19,213
I was thinking I could lock him in there.

80
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,257
- What?
- Make it look like an accident.

81
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,717
Let him freeze to death.

82
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,512
- Jesus, Becka.
- What?

83
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,889
Well, it's just the way you said it.

84
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,016
Well, we still want him dead, don't we?

85
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,477
- Yeah, but…
- Not like that.

86
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,272
I mean, that's just...
Come on, that's a bit risky.

87
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,316
Risky. Exactly.

88
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,109
Come on! Give me a chance.

89
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:42,819
It's not a clean kill, Becka.

90
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,324
You with the cabin fire?
Her with the poisoned liver?

91
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,409
I mean,
when has it ever been a clean kill?

92
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,788
The paintballing? The marina?

93
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:56,416
Yeah, exactly, which is why
we can't afford any more cock-ups.

94
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,919
Look, I don't want you
to end up in prison.

95
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,213
Answer's no.

96
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,264
I rubbed it down with a wet cloth.

97
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,141
You'd never even know
there was marmalade on it.

98
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,352
Still no sign of Roger.

99
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,773
You don't think it's true, do you?

100
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:23,777
No smoke without a fire, Mammy.
You know that.

101
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,571
Where is he, though?

102
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,614
Why won't this thing tie?

103
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,285
It's just nerves. It's only natural.

104
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:35,539
I know quite a few people that would be
very upset if I got that job.

105
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,417
Be nice to get it just to see their faces.

106
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,919
Well, hope Eva isn't too disappointed.

107
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,464
She worked really hard for that promotion.

108
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,216
And what? I didn't?

109
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,760
- No.
- Mmm.

110
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,472
You want your sister to get the job.
I get it.

111
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,017
Blood is thicker than water.

112
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:58,562
And there's still marmalade
on this jacket.

113
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,939
Have a nice day.

114
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,026
Is Dad okay?

115
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,405
Oh, yeah. He just has a lot on his mind.

116
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,116
Come on. I'll walk you to school.

117
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,162
I hate how that woman makes tea.

118
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,748
No, you just hate her.

119
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,918
Yeah, but because of how she makes tea.

120
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,255
My granny, um, when I was little,

121
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,759
used to put a drop of whiskey in my tea
when I was feeling under the weather.

122
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,344
It was delicious.

123
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,136
Are you feeling under the weather?

124
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,097
Just nerves.

125
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,601
- What are you nervous of?
- Rejection.

126
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,602
- Do you not remember?
- Ah.

127
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,523
- Hey, that's not the Eva Garvey I know.
- My God.

128
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,358
Are you gonna give me a pep talk now?

129
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,984
Why do you always do that?

130
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,946
- What do I do?
- Make a joke.

131
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,949
Maybe I was about to say something,
I don't know, profound.

132
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,617
Yeah.

133
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,453
Go on then, Aristotle. Let's hear it.

134
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,123
- I admire you.
- Why would you say a thing like that?

135
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,293
I... To do what you did
when your mom and dad died.

136
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:07,130
To raise a family…
I mean, you are a lioness, Eva.

137
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:11,134
Aw.
Well, you would have done the same.

138
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,387
Uh, me? No, I run away from everything.

139
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,099
Eh, look,
I'm just saying you deserve this job.

140
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,143
So, go in there and act like it.

141
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,478
- Okay.
- Mmm.

142
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,278
And then we'll get some whiskey
for your tea.

143
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,362
Yeah.

144
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,322
Your granny has a lot to answer for.

145
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,616
I know! She raised a lush.

146
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,457
Sit down there, Eva.

147
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,917
Well, I am sitting.

148
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,837
Of course you are.
No, no, I'm sorry.

149
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,842
Um…
Look, uh, at the outset,

150
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:56,013
I just wanna say that I really,
really value the work that you do here.

151
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,391
I didn't get it, did I?

152
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,521
Um, do you mind if I ask why?

153
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:07,900
Because, uh, I'm...
I'm better qualified than him

154
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,335
and you said I did a great interview.

155
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,320
Well, sometimes…
…these decisions

156
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,323
are based more on just who's
the best-qualified candidate.

157
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,241
- Are they? I...
- Yeah, yeah.

158
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:19,286
I just feel that JP is more, well…

159
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,581
…temperamentally suited to the role.

160
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,833
Temperamentally suited?

161
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,543
This wasn't an easy decision, Eva.

162
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,379
Right. So, I'm...
I'm temperamentally unsuited.

163
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,257
No, I'm just concerned
that you might not have the, um…

164
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,718
…well, shall we say…

165
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:40,015
…um, mental resources to cope
with the additional pressure

166
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:43,143
in a way that's healthy.

167
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:23,725
Roger.

168
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,196
It's not true, Grace.

169
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,262
I know it's... You don't need to pretend.
I know everybody's been talking about it.

170
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:44,955
Well, I don't listen to rumors,
Roger.

171
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,416
It was terrible.

172
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,459
They were asking me
all sorts of questions.

173
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,753
Love.

174
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,548
"How come a man
of your age has never married?"

175
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:58,969
And, "You seem to have
an unnatural interest in children."

176
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,722
But that's ridiculous.
Just because you run a youth club

177
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,366
- does not automatically mean you're...
- I know.

178
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,642
I've had text messages from parents,

179
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,352
people who've known me for years,

180
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,156
telling me to stay away
from their children.

181
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,481
But I don't understand.
How did this happen?

182
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,276
Well, somebody called the Guards.

183
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,862
Somebody round here would be my guess.

184
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,618
- Six hours they held me for, Grace.
- Oh.

185
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,429
If they hadn't have taken
my shoelaces off me,

186
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:28,332
I'd have topped myself.

187
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,709
Oh, darling, don't cry on my account.

188
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,630
I'm not. I m-mean, I'm sorry. I'm...

189
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,548
What is it, Grace?

190
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,176
Grace, what is it?

191
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,805
It's John Paul.

192
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,767
They found him unconscious
in the water at the marina.

193
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,145
- I nearly lost him.
- What?

194
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,691
- He tried to kill himself.
- JP?

195
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,153
- But why?
- I don't know.

196
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:00,364
He won't say. He keeps shutting me out.

197
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:04,117
Oh, Jesus,
here's me going on about my problems,

198
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,912
and you've got this going on.

199
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,622
I can't make him talk to me.

200
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,127
He will in time.
And yous will both get through this.

201
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:18,215
Look, I know he will.
He's got you, hasn't he?

202
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,718
Oh, Roger.

203
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,349
- Don't cry, love.
- Sorry.

204
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:31,645
Apparently,
I'm not emotionally equipped for the job.

205
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,856
- What, and JP is?
- Yeah, well, yeah.

206
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,691
- He seemed to think so.
- Come on!

207
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,860
I fished him out of the marina
the other night

208
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,403
with his balls hanging out.

209
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:43,282
I'm sure he said something to him,
to poison his mind against me.

210
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:47,578
- Poisoned it how?
- Well, I wasn't well, was I?

211
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,621
Had a spell in rehab.

212
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,208
- Oh, right. God, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

213
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,711
Not such a lioness after all.

214
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:59,214
- And you think he told him?
- Well… …yeah!

215
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,091
I mean, he was the only one who knew.

216
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,111
Apart from my sisters,
they wouldn't have said anything.

217
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:04,887
I mean, I wouldn't put it past the...

218
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,347
Excuse me, ladies.

219
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,028
What the fuck?

220
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:34,166
There we go.
You're looking at your new boss.

221
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,801
Prick.

222
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:50,349
I knew that job inside out. It was mine.

223
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,059
Gerald as good as said it.

224
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,311
And you definitely think it was JP
who told him?

225
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,729
- About the breakdown?
- Yeah.

226
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,899
I could hear it in his voice.
See it in his face.

227
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,026
You know, the fear.

228
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,869
Like he was gonna
have to phone an ambulance.

229
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:04,696
Have the madwoman sectioned.

230
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,823
Sorry.

231
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,493
Ben, this isn't a good time.

232
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,621
And when has it ever been?
I need to see you.

233
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,414
I can't. I'm at Bibi's.

234
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:17,459
And what if I told you I had
the answer to everything?

235
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,797
Okay, uh, tomorrow lunchtime. Where?

236
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,423
I'll send you the location.

237
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:26,009
Can you not just tell me?

238
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:33,892
Honestly, I'd almost stab him
to death in the office at this stage.

239
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,854
- Take me chances with a jury.
- Eva.

240
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,440
What? All you need is
one juror who's sympathetic.

241
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,776
What about my plan?

242
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,319
You were told no, Becka.

243
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,574
- No, let's hear it again.
- Okay.

244
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:53,662
Well, I did some research.
And I bought a ham.

245
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,873
A ham?

246
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,083
Yeah.

247
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,503
I was trying to figure out how long
it would take JP to freeze to death.

248
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:04,965
Anyway, the ham weighed two kilos.

249
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,508
And so, I put it in the freezer,

250
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:09,178
and it was frozen solid
after about an hour.

251
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:13,015
So, JP weighs, I'm guessing,
what, like 80 kilos?

252
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:17,644
- So, it would be 40 times how...
- Jesus Christ, Becka.

253
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:19,396
It's not like the cartoons.

254
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,648
What do you mean?

255
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:25,986
I mean, you don't die the second your body
is frozen all the way through.

256
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:30,365
He'd die from hypothermia first,
long before the body's actually frozen.

257
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:33,118
Well, how long we talking?

258
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,079
Two to three hours?
Depending on how cold the room is.

259
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,332
That's a good point.
Is there temperature control?

260
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,666
Yeah.

261
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:45,672
Um.
I actually don't know.

262
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,842
Let's go and check it out.

263
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:05,483
I want $20 a night for three weeks.
That's $300.

264
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,402
I'll give you a hundred.

265
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:22,584
Got it. I got the job!

266
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,045
Oh, I was so worried when you didn't call.

267
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,256
Gerald took me out
for a long lunch.

268
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,551
Blanaid, Daddy got a new job.

269
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,636
Will you get a pay rise?

270
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,638
Oh, there'll be more money, all right.

271
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:35,806
Yes.

272
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,349
Can I get my teeth straightened?

273
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,518
No, 'cause there's
nothing wrong with them.

274
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:43,355
You have a smile
that would give Mona Lisa a complex.

275
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:48,026
- I'll get that.
- Okay.

276
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,530
You, there's nothing wrong
with your teeth.

277
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,116
It's your nose you need sorting out.

278
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:59,246
What do you want?

279
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,457
Listen, JP, um…
…I just wanted to say,

280
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,418
Grace told me about your... your trouble.

281
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:05,919
Did she now?

282
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,588
Yeah. Is it a bad time?

283
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:12,718
With everything I'm hearing about you,
Roger, I'd say anytime is a bad time.

284
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,428
Well, that was a setup.

285
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,138
So, where have you been all this time?

286
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,348
I was questioned by the police.

287
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,309
No, not for a week you weren't.

288
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:22,769
Oh, well, I went away for a few days.

289
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:24,330
- I've got a sister up in Bettystown.
- Mmm.

290
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:28,400
And she can vouch for that, can she?
That you were there the whole time?

291
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:31,737
"Vouch for that," JP?
Why you asking me all these questions?

292
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,324
It's like I said, it's probably better
that you stay away from here.

293
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:38,285
I have a 12-year-old daughter
in the house.

294
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,329
And it's my duty to protect her.

295
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,884
Come on. Minna's asleep.

296
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,636
And we definitely won't wake her?

297
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,346
She'd sleep through an earthquake.

298
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,141
Here.

299
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,060
We might need these.

300
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,731
Thermostat's on the outside.

301
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,817
Yes! I knew it! I knew
there was a thermostat. Had a feeling.

302
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,445
He keeps the key… …in here.

303
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,161
I was thinking of hiding in there.

304
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:27,751
JP walks past, goes inside, I jump out,
lock the door, turn the temperature up.

305
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:29,211
- Down.
- Down.

306
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,839
Yeah. It goes to minus 32 degrees Celsius.

307
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,757
What if he takes the key inside with him?

308
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,676
I was gonna get a spare key cut.

309
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,511
Yeah, but he'd still have a key in there.

310
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:42,891
Uh, there's no lock on the inside,
so there's no way he can get out.

311
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,310
- Then what happens?
- I come back after a few hours,

312
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:49,439
unlock the door, take the spare key,
turn the temperature back up.

313
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,192
Grace reports him missing.
The Guards come.

314
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:55,445
And find him curled up with his dead dad.

315
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:58,031
Like a Swedish Norman Bates.

316
00:19:58,115 --> 00:19:59,449
Then what?

317
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,953
Then they presume he fell asleep.

318
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,414
I like it.

319
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,134
Oh, my God. Whoa.

320
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,595
- Jesus, my nips.
- It's very chilly.

321
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,058
- Urs, I don't think you want...
- Oh, please.

322
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:27,477
Do you know how many
dead bodies I've seen in my life?

323
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,942
Jesus. Image of John Paul, isn't he?

324
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:38,447
It's been a long time
since JP was that hard.

325
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:47,080
So, what would happen?

326
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:49,058
His, uh, body temperature
would fall very quickly.

327
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,843
He'd have a burning sensation
like pins and needles all over his body.

328
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:53,962
His heart rate, respiratory rate,

329
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:56,006
uh, blood pressure would drop.

330
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,425
His body would slow the supply
of oxygen to his brain.

331
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:02,012
He'd feel drowsy,
and he'd slip into unconsciousness.

332
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,473
Then his heart would just…

333
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:05,891
- Stop.
- Yep.

334
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:13,440
Have you got mobile coverage in here?

335
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,652
- I've no signal. No.
- No.

336
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:17,903
Me neither.

337
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:20,405
Do you think it's soundproof?

338
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:23,325
- Who's gonna hear him screaming?
- Well, Minna might.

339
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,286
Are you deliberately trying
to find holes in the plan?

340
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,541
Yeah! I am because that's what it means
when you recce a job.

341
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:33,377
Recce? Ooh, profesh.

342
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,753
What's the matter with you?

343
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:36,338
This is exactly the kind of thing

344
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:38,757
that's gonna land us in prison
for the rest of our lives.

345
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:40,384
Okay, okay.

346
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,636
You all go outside
and see if you can hear anything.

347
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,847
Go, go, go, go, go.

348
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:49,726
Oh.

349
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:52,521
Help!

350
00:21:56,733 --> 00:22:02,489
Help! My mad bitch sisters-in-law
are trying to kill me!

351
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:13,292
Ah, shit. It's freezing. I'm coming out.

352
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:18,547
It worked?

353
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:20,632
Well, it's not soundproof.

354
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,260
What are you talking about?

355
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,703
I literally couldn't hear a thing.

356
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,305
Well, tough shit because I could.

357
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,807
What did you hear then, bat ears?

358
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:31,727
It doesn't matter.
You're not doing it, Becka.

359
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:35,105
Why? 'Cause you don't trust me?

360
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,901
- I can do this, Eva!
- No, you can't.

361
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:42,362
Sorry, Becka. Mommy says no.

362
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,523
Matt, where in the name of Jesus are you?
I said to you nine o'clock.

363
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,519
Inspector Loftus coming through.

364
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:19,066
What the hell are you doing here?

365
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:21,193
Inspector, brought you a bit of breakfast.

366
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:22,956
Heard you're partial to a rasher sandwich.

367
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:25,197
Not when I'm digging up a corpse, I'm not.

368
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:27,115
Bloody eejit.

369
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:30,160
I just wanted to be here
in case there was any news.

370
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:32,871
What, do you think
we're gonna crack open the lid

371
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:34,831
and let you check the body
for bullet holes?

372
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,340
Inspector,
can you sign this, please?

373
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:51,306
- Thank you.
- When will you know something?

374
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:53,976
We'll know when we know.

375
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,812
And you'll know
when I decide you will know.

376
00:23:57,646 --> 00:23:59,147
Now, get out of here.

377
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:01,817
Would you want the…

378
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:08,866
Dickwad.

379
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,910
- What?
- G... Good luck. I just said good luck.

380
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,770
Becka, I can see that you're in there.

381
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:53,035
So, go on.

382
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,804
You've had all night
to come up with an excuse.

383
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:55,829
Where were you?

384
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,582
- I'm sorry. I just... I was...
- Just what?

385
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:01,543
What are you doing here, Matt?
What do you want?

386
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,755
I want you.

387
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,799
I want you.

388
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,553
I've been sitting here since eight o'clock
last night waiting for you.

389
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:18,435
Another time-waster.

390
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:35,118
Look, this thing between us,

391
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,621
whatever it is, it's real for me.

392
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:44,753
It is for me too.

393
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:23,208
- Oh.
- Oh, what's that?

394
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:24,376
Oh, um, sorry.

395
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:27,004
- It's last night's tortilla chips.
- Oh.

396
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:55,991
Matt?

397
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:57,743
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

398
00:26:57,826 --> 00:27:00,162
Yeah, I'll... I'll get going in a second.

399
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:10,714
I'm sorry.

400
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:13,425
I'm sorry.

401
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,470
I don't know why it's…

402
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:29,399
- I'm sorry.
- No.

403
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:32,611
It's not like we have to have sex
every time we hang out.

404
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:36,031
I'm gonna get a glass of water.

405
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:39,326
You want one?

406
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,808
Shall I hit the road, or?

407
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:48,020
Uh… I don't mind.

408
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:49,980
What, you... you want me to go?

409
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:53,063
No, I'm not saying I want you to go.
I'm just saying I don't mind if you do.

410
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:54,818
Oh.

411
00:28:56,195 --> 00:28:57,279
Okay.

412
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:33,065
Is, uh… …is everything okay?

413
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,693
Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.

414
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:41,156
Uh… Yeah, I'll c... I'll call you.

415
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,616
Mm-hmm.

416
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:04,304
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

417
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:08,225
Shit. Shit. Shit.

418
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:14,898
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

419
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:17,401
They dug him up?

420
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:20,821
Jesus Christ. I'm not...
I-I'm not gonna see the kids grow up.

421
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:22,990
Just don't go losing it, okay?

422
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:25,093
They wouldn't have dug up the body
if they weren't on to us.

423
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:26,469
No, they're gonna start
pulling at threads.

424
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:28,638
And they're not gonna stop
until they find out what we've done.

425
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:31,999
I can't believe that you can just dig up
a body without telling the family.

426
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:33,834
Should we tell Grace?

427
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:36,086
Absolutely not. No way.

428
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,490
Okay, I just want you to know now

429
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:39,315
that I'd rather kill myself
than go to prison.

430
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,341
Will you just calm down?

431
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:43,010
You're a nurse.

432
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:45,596
You're supposed to be
good under pressure.

433
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:49,641
How did you know, by the way?

434
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:53,729
What do you mean?

435
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:56,607
Well, just how did you know
that they dug up the body?

436
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:03,488
Is someone gonna tell me what's going on?

437
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:07,159
Becka, if you don't, I will.

438
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,872
I've been seeing Matt Claffin.

439
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:15,959
What? You've been...
You've been seeing him a-as in you...

440
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:17,419
You've been sleeping with him?

441
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:19,630
I have slept with him. Yes.

442
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:25,093
What the hell are you thinking, Becka?

443
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:27,262
See, I knew this is how you'd react.

444
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:28,847
What the fuck, Bibi?

445
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:30,724
I... She said she was gonna end it.

446
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:33,786
I haven't told him anything
if that's what you're worried about.

447
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,812
I mean, we don't even talk about the case.

448
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:37,564
No, I'm sure he doesn't.

449
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:39,292
Yeah, I bet he didn't tell you
he was digging up

450
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:42,027
your brother-in-law's body
this morning, did he?

451
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,989
I mean, why him, Becka? Of all people.

452
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:48,384
I mean, did you sleep with
every other man this side of the city?

453
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:49,576
Now, now, Eva. Come on.

454
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,079
Who are you to tell me
who I can and can't sleep with?

455
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:54,957
I'm the one who's trying
to look out for you, okay?

456
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,251
- Like I always have.
- Yeah.

457
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,545
Spare me the martyr act.

458
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:03,966
I'm sick to the teeth of hearing
how poor Eva Garvey

459
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:06,134
gave up everything
to raise her little sisters.

460
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:07,219
Come on, stop.

461
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:09,555
Yeah, it was that
or have you put into care. Okay?

462
00:32:11,974 --> 00:32:13,392
Don't lay your guilt on me.

463
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,229
Only reason you've got
your nose in my life is

464
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:19,398
'cause you've got no life of your own.

465
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:22,150
- You do not...
- Oh, my God.

466
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:24,027
- No. No. No! No. No.
- No. No. No.

467
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:25,362
- Get off me!
- Stop it!

468
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:28,907
Okay.
Jesus, just... just get out of my house.

469
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:30,534
Okay? All of you.

470
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:35,414
You can rot in prison…
…for all I care.

471
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,986
So, I read this thing that if you dangle
a chain over the belly of a pregnant lady,

472
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:08,822
you can accurately predict
the sex of the baby.

473
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:10,323
That's bullshit.

474
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:12,177
If it moves
in a clockwise direction it's a boy.

475
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:14,953
- If it moves anti-clockwise...
- Well, we said we didn't wanna know.

476
00:33:15,037 --> 00:33:17,164
I thought you said it was bullshit.

477
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,045
Hmm.

478
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:33,514
Off... It's a boy!

479
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:35,766
- I can see you moving your wrist.
- What?

480
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:40,479
Oh. You're in good form.

481
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:43,941
They dug him up.

482
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:46,568
This morning.

483
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:49,029
And that's what it takes
to put a smile on your face, is it?

484
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:52,991
- They killed him, Theresa.
- I know it.

485
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:55,285
Does Matt?

486
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:57,871
Know it, I mean.

487
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:01,124
Matt's never been
the best judge of people.

488
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:05,671
- He's in love with her, Tom.
- No, he's not.

489
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:08,340
He's thinking with his dick. That's all.

490
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:12,969
I can see it. Even if you can't.

491
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:15,848
Tom, are you here?

492
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:27,317
You have to know when push comes
to shove if you can rely on him or not.

493
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:41,248
Where were you this morning?

494
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:44,626
Told you I'm not hanging around
some grave like a ghoul.

495
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:49,882
I just wanted to make sure
they dug up the right body, is all.

496
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:53,302
So, where were you?

497
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:55,721
- In answer to me question, like?
- Jesus.

498
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:57,973
A copper wouldn't ask me that.

499
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:01,393
Were you with her?

500
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:04,980
- Her name's Becka.
- I know her name.

501
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:06,523
I know all their bleeding names.

502
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:08,525
Yeah, I was with her.

503
00:35:09,026 --> 00:35:10,670
After me telling you
to stay away from her?

504
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:12,905
After you telling me?

505
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:14,448
Do you wanna wind your neck in?

506
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:16,158
All right, I suggested it then.

507
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,512
If you weren't actually
getting information from her...

508
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:22,122
Yeah, and I chose to not
take your suggestion on board. So…

509
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,102
- You're out of your depth, Matt.
- Oh, Thomas, would you relax, okay?

510
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:28,837
I have everything under control.
All right?

511
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:30,589
- And she knows, by the way.
- Knows what?

512
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:32,966
That you dug up her brother-in-law's body.

513
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,690
That we dug up her brother-in-law's body?

514
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,094
Yeah. We then.

515
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,013
How?

516
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:40,933
Because you decided
to tell me it in a text.

517
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:42,976
She read it when I was in the kitchen.

518
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,063
She was gonna find out
sooner or later, Matt.

519
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:49,900
Soon as the cops know how the man died,
they'll be kicking down her door.

520
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:53,111
They'll be kicking down all their doors.

521
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:12,881
Ça va?

522
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:15,092
Ça va.

523
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:17,636
Uh, Eva, do you have
the pre-tender estimate

524
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,137
for the Robertson project?

525
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:21,306
The...

526
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:23,058
The Robertson project.

527
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:25,537
You were asked for it yesterday,
but if it's too much for you,

528
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:27,646
- I can ask Janis.
- It's not too much.

529
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:32,818
If you are struggling to cope,
I want you to be able to say it to me.

530
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:34,987
- I said I'd do it.
- Good.

531
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,155
Want it by 3:00.

532
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:42,911
Uh, and, Eva, watch how you speak to me.

533
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:45,539
I can understand you're disappointed,
but I'm your boss now,

534
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:46,957
whether you like it or not.

535
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,669
And while we're here in the office,
you will show me respect.

536
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:21,491
Hey. Is it really necessary
to rub her nose in it like that?

537
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:23,285
Do you mind?

538
00:37:26,205 --> 00:37:27,789
Eva deserved that job.

539
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:31,877
You must have said something
very bad to Gerald to change his mind.

540
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,881
Ah. You fighting her battles
for her now, are you?

541
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:37,716
That's sweet.

542
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:40,928
Your great mate. Except, she isn't.

543
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,596
- Oh, yeah?
- I mean,

544
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:47,518
she wouldn't have told me your deepest,
darkest secret if she was, would she?

545
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:50,562
About you being a homosexual.

546
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:53,857
Is it still all right to use that phrase?

547
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,403
See, the thing here is
that you haven't known Eva that long.

548
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:01,615
Her jaw gets very loose when she drinks.

549
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:03,325
- She told you?
- Told me,

550
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:05,452
told her sisters, yeah.

551
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:09,581
I'm sure the entire office knows by now,
what you are.

552
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:12,125
I'd say you thrashed the water to a foam

553
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:14,562
to be the one to give me
mouth-to-mouth, didn't you?

554
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:16,129
I should have let you drown.

555
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:20,092
Was it you who took my pants off?
Did you get a good look at it?

556
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:23,720
Oh, hey.
I could have you up in front of HR...

557
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:27,182
Hey, mate.
You're the one who followed me in here.

558
00:38:27,683 --> 00:38:30,769
I could say that you tried it on with me.

559
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:33,689
Because I've seen the way you look at me.

560
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:37,818
- Don't do that.
- Ow!

561
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,956
Hey.

562
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:56,503
Gabriel.

563
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:05,387
All right there, Gabe? Is everything…

564
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:10,475
Gabriel.

565
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:18,734
Gabriel. Gabriel!

566
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,154
I can't believe you told him.
Of all people.

567
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:23,237
Told him what?

568
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:27,826
Oh, Jesus. I-I didn't. I...

569
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,536
So how does he know?

570
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,622
You're the only one in the office I told.

571
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:35,417
Shit. Grace must have said something.

572
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,312
Oh, yeah,
he said you told your sisters as well.

573
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:39,213
Yeah, but only because they kept asking

574
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:42,216
if something was going on
between us. That's all.

575
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:44,468
Oh, so my private life is what?
Gossip to you?

576
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:46,762
Gabriel, please, just...
This is what he does. Okay?

577
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:49,348
He just gets inside people's heads,
and he messes with them.

578
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:51,141
So what's going on between you two?

579
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:54,269
- Who? Me and JP?
- Yeah.

580
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:56,855
You going to pretend you don't know
what I'm talking about?

581
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:00,293
You say you hate him,
but sometimes it seems to me

582
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:02,319
like there's something else.

583
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:05,155
Gabriel.

584
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:08,742
Whatever game you two are playing,
I want no part of it.

585
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:20,003
How are you?

586
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:23,090
Sorry.
Didn't mean to put the shits up you.

587
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:25,133
- What do you want?
- I just...

588
00:40:26,552 --> 00:40:28,220
- It's been two days.
- So?

589
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:29,888
So what was the result?

590
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:33,559
It's a postmortem, Mr. Claffin,
not a bloody horse race.

591
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:36,353
Well, then I was thinking,
the longer it goes on,

592
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:39,273
the more likely it is
they've found something iffy.

593
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,441
Am I right?

594
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:43,986
I've concluded my work
and sent my report to the police.

595
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:45,529
Well, so did you find anything?

596
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:48,657
I'm not at liberty
to discuss my findings with you.

597
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,868
- Could you not even give me a steer?
- Oh.

598
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:53,871
A steer you want, is it?
Well, why didn't you say?

599
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:56,915
There's a steer for you. Now jog on!

600
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:01,670
My bloody business on the line.

601
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:08,468
You've a terrible personality.

602
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:10,554
You said what?

603
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,681
I let him have it.

604
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,600
Both barrels.

605
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:17,519
You're gonna get yourself
arrested, Tom.

606
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:21,648
We're being dicked around, Matt.
Dicked around royally.

607
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:24,276
And what in Jesus' name am I eating,
by the way?

608
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:26,236
Breakfast roll.

609
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,407
Sausage, bacon, egg,
black and white pudding in a baguette.

610
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,451
I can feel the fur in me arteries already.

611
00:41:32,534 --> 00:41:34,745
You know what they call this
in the sandwich shop?

612
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:37,039
- What?
- The Widowmaker.

613
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:40,000
Jesus.

614
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,174
It's Loftus.

615
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:49,176
Answer the thing.

616
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:51,303
Inspector Loftus.

617
00:41:52,387 --> 00:41:53,747
Yeah, I'm after been waiting all...

618
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:55,182
So, what's the story?

619
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:58,894
Now, could you gimme that
in layman's terms?

620
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:03,190
So what does it mean?

621
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:05,817
Hello? Hello?

622
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:07,194
What'd he say?

623
00:42:07,277 --> 00:42:09,738
Tom, what did he say?

624
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:12,950
- The results are inconclusive.
- Inconclusive as in…

625
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:14,451
Jesus, as in inconclusive.

626
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:16,495
As in nothing… …suspicious
to report.

627
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:19,665
So, what?
We had a man's body dug up for no reason?

628
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:21,388
No, not no reason, Matt. They killed him.

629
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,210
Just in a way that didn't leave a mark.

630
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:28,674
Tom, you're gonna have to let this go now.

631
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:29,943
Well, that's easy for you to say.

632
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:32,028
You don't have to go home
and tell your massively pregnant wife

633
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:33,652
- you're going to jail.
- Look, I'm sorry.

634
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:36,723
They did it, Matt. I know it. You know it.

635
00:42:36,807 --> 00:42:39,017
It's just, we're never gonna know how.

636
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:01,039
Back inside the prison,

637
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:07,254
Fred is subjected to merciless torture
led by Gestapo head Walter Guettner.

638
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:09,506
He was a little rat.

639
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:13,719
And I could have killed him
with one hand if I was free.

640
00:43:27,149 --> 00:43:28,400
What am I doing here?

641
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:30,611
- So, what do you think?
- Of what?

642
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:32,321
That house.

643
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:36,617
I mean,
I know it's the same as that house.

644
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:38,785
But this one is available for rent,

645
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:41,413
and I can afford it
if I give up my studio.

646
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,207
You love your studio.

647
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,667
I don't love it as much
as I wanna be with you.

648
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:49,004
And there's a room for Molly and David,
and Michael as well.

649
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:52,341
I wanna be whatever you need me to be...

650
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:54,259
- Ben.
- No. This can work for us, Urs.

651
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:56,470
I really think it can. If you could just...

652
00:43:56,553 --> 00:43:58,555
Ben, I can't see you anymore.

653
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:01,119
- What are you talking about?
- Please don't ask me to explain.

654
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:02,184
Of course,

655
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:04,436
- I'm going to ask you to explain.
- Please. Please.

656
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,855
No. I deserve to know, don't you think?

657
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:08,607
- John Paul…
- What about him?

658
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:11,443
- He has a photograph of me.
- Of you?

659
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:14,530
Of... Of my, uh…

660
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:18,199
How?

661
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:21,036
- You didn't...
- No, of course, I didn't.

662
00:44:21,912 --> 00:44:23,372
He got into my phone.

663
00:44:23,455 --> 00:44:26,375
He switched his number for yours,
and he told me to take a picture.

664
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:30,295
I... I-I thought I was sending it to you.
He sent it to Donal.

665
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:31,713
- He what?
- It's okay,

666
00:44:31,797 --> 00:44:33,257
I deleted it before Donal saw it,

667
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,175
but he'll do it again
if I keep on seeing you.

668
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:37,803
And I-I-I don't know
what will happen if Donal sees that.

669
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:40,931
He could get nasty,
and I might lose the kids.

670
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:43,433
- I'm gonna kill him.
- You're only gonna make things worse.

671
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:45,620
- I wouldn't have said anything...
- No. I'm gonna fucking kill him.

672
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:48,146
Ben, stop. Please. Ben.

673
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:52,109
Ben. Come here. Come here.

- Hi.

682
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:25,559
Oh. Hiya, Becka.

683
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:27,019
- Hi.
- Hiya.

684
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:31,565
- Um, can we talk?
- Sure.

685
00:45:32,524 --> 00:45:34,651
- I wanna do it. Tonight.
- Becka.

686
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:37,154
When he drops the shopping off
and goes to check on the body.

687
00:45:38,864 --> 00:45:40,199
Eva said no, Becka.

688
00:45:40,866 --> 00:45:44,828
That room was completely soundproof.
We couldn't hear a word outta you.

689
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:47,456
I'm sick of her treating me like a baby.

690
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:52,169
You know where she's coming from.
You're the daughter she never had.

691
00:45:52,252 --> 00:45:54,922
Well, she's the mother I never wanted.
Okay?

692
00:45:57,424 --> 00:45:59,360
She just doesn't want you
to have blood on your hands.

693
00:45:59,384 --> 00:46:01,595
Bibi, I have to do this.

694
00:46:02,513 --> 00:46:03,639
If JP would kill his dad,

695
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:05,442
he wouldn't think twice
about killing Minna.

696
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:08,101
That's Urs.

697
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:10,854
- I told her to meet us here.
- You did what?

698
00:46:22,491 --> 00:46:24,117
Seriously, Urs?

699
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:26,328
We... We don't have to tell Eva.

700
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:28,372
Not until it's done.

701
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:36,088
I suppose I should wish you luck.

702
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:42,761
I don't need luck.

703
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:09,329
Cleaned it off, have you?

704
00:47:22,342 --> 00:47:24,595
- Evening, all.
- Oh, hey, love.

705
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,638
You're just in time.

706
00:47:26,722 --> 00:47:28,932
I'm cooking your favorite.

707
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:32,978
- Oh, my God. Daddy, your eye.
- Jesus, JP.

708
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:35,063
You should've seen the other guy.

709
00:47:35,147 --> 00:47:37,357
- Who?
- Your sister's mate, um,

710
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:39,318
or what's... what is he to her?

711
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:40,736
- Gabriel?
- Mm-hmm.

712
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:42,696
Why would he do that? He saved your life.

713
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:44,281
Did something set him off?

714
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:46,783
You know what the French are like.
Furious about everything.

715
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:49,995
Turning lorries upside down,
setting fire to fish.

716
00:47:50,078 --> 00:47:51,830
- What?
- Did you call the police?

717
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:54,791
No. Gerald gave him
his marching orders.

718
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:58,420
Never had much taste in men,
that sister of yours, did she?

719
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:01,507
- Your poor eye.
- Mmm. It's all right, Mammy.

720
00:48:02,007 --> 00:48:04,092
Listen, I'll just go do the shopping
for my mum.

721
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:06,011
- I just need to get changed.
- Okay.

722
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:08,096
Mmm.

723
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:11,099
Mmm.

724
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:13,727
It's nice to see you so…

725
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:16,480
- So?
- I don't know.

726
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:18,065
Full of yourself again.

727
00:48:18,148 --> 00:48:20,234
I know I haven't been at my best lately,

728
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:23,820
but I promise it's only happy times
ahead for us now.

729
00:48:25,155 --> 00:48:26,532
Mmm?

730
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,751
You make me feel young again.

731
00:48:37,835 --> 00:48:39,086
My pleasure.

732
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:42,714
A few more sessions
and you'll have the hip of a...

733
00:48:42,798 --> 00:48:45,259
Well, of a me, actually.

734
00:48:45,342 --> 00:48:47,886
Be a lovely thing to be your hip's age.

735
00:48:48,428 --> 00:48:50,848
All of me, though. Not just a hip.

736
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:52,891
- What would you do differently?
- Mmm?

737
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:54,393
If you were my age?

738
00:48:55,227 --> 00:48:58,856
More sex. For starters.

739
00:48:58,939 --> 00:49:01,400
And I'd get my nose pierced.

740
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:05,070
That's easy.
I'll pierce your nose for you.

741
00:49:05,153 --> 00:49:08,740
No. John Paul would go mad.

742
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:10,993
That's another reason to do it.

743
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:13,954
Okay, you're gonna feel a little prick.

744
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:15,622
- Ah, a little p...
- Don't say it.

745
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:18,750
- You ready?
- Mmm.

746
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:24,339
- One. Two. Three.
- Oh. Fi... Fu... Ow.

747
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:26,967
- Ooh.
- Ooh. Sorry.

748
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:33,724
- Okay. Put that on your nose.
- Mm-hmm.

749
00:49:36,852 --> 00:49:40,105
So what time does JP come here?

750
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:42,858
Sometime after 9:00.

751
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:45,569
Although I don't think
I can stay awake tonight.

752
00:49:46,195 --> 00:49:49,698
That massage has made me sleepy.

753
00:49:53,493 --> 00:49:54,828
Give me that.

754
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:04,379
Ah.

755
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:06,882
Okay.

756
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:10,636
That actually looks really good.

757
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:13,722
There you go.

758
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:17,309
Oh. Oh.

759
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:20,354
Do you think George will like it?

760
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:23,899
- I do.
- Yeah.

761
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:29,905
Mmm. Mm-mmm.

762
00:51:01,728 --> 00:51:07,693
Jesus Christ. What is this madman doing?

763
00:51:09,778 --> 00:51:13,699
Ah! Look, it's the lover.
What can I do for you?

764
00:51:18,537 --> 00:51:20,956
Anyone sees that photograph…

765
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:25,252
…I'll kill you and not give a shit
about going to prison.

766
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:28,130
Please let go. Please let go.

767
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:50,439
It's done, Eva.

768
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:53,025
What's done?

769
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:55,777
The prick is dead.
