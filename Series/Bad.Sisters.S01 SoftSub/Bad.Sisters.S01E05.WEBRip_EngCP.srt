1
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,044
- Sorry. We're from...
- I know who you are.

2
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:48,090
Last but not least.
We interviewed all of your sisters.

3
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,050
Yeah. I know.

4
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,677
- Can we come in?
- No.

5
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,345
We just have a few questions.

6
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,514
I don't like unexpected callers.

7
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,237
I thought your sisters would've told you.

8
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,684
Have my sisters got your schedule?

9
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,579
- Would you like us to schedule...
- No. But, yeah, we're here now, Matt.

10
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,604
Yeah.

11
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,908
Keep yours on.

12
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,787
It's a really handsome space.

13
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,127
Wow.

14
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,797
- Well, somebody's a good shot.
- Yeah, I am.

15
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,583
Must be tricky. With the…

16
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,709
No.

17
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:51,380
So, we just have one or two questions
about the accident.

18
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,969
Which one? The crash that killed
my parents or the one where I lost my eye?

19
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:02,057
The latter. Although, yours was a bit more
than a fender bender outside a hotel.

20
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,686
- Sorry. It must be hard...
- However, I mean, it ruined your life.

21
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,606
Funny enough, no.
Losing an eye is just losing an eye.

22
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,236
Humans are adaptable.
Sometimes I forget completely.

23
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,447
- So you didn't blame John Paul?
- No.

24
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,908
Well, he blamed you
on his insurance claim form.

25
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,618
Yeah, we put it behind us.

26
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,954
I had my eye, he had his hole in his head.

27
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,457
It can't be easy,
having your brain exposed like that.

28
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,376
Even Stephens.

29
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:36,258
I have just seen Mary Tracey
having a sneaky fag behind her shed

30
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,844
in a Christmas dressing gown.

31
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,263
The old shrew is human after all.

32
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:46,852
Hello. I'm Nora, Bibi's wife.

33
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,145
- How are you?
- How are you?

34
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,856
Did you get tea or coffee?

35
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,068
- No.
- No? Do you want tea or coffee?

36
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,695
- No.
- Yes, please.

37
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,282
Are you from a church?

38
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,492
What church?

39
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,037
No. We're from Claffin Insurance.

40
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,955
I'm Matt and this is Thomas.

41
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,125
Right. Now that I have you here
in front of me, I can ask you straight.

42
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,504
When are you going to pay Gracie?
That poor woman has suffered enough.

43
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,173
- We're making sure everything lines up.
- Lines up how?

44
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,425
You draw a line from that man
in any direction,

45
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:19,927
and you'll find nothing but misery.

46
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,846
Look at Bibi.
He ruined her life in an instant.

47
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,641
Just to tickle his sadistic streak.

48
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,520
And worst still, he refused
to take any responsibility for it.

49
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,939
No, in his head, it was all Bibi.

50
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,334
- He said once, when I challenged him...
- How do you take your coffee?

51
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,442
What did he say?

52
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,819
How do you take it?

53
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,030
One sugar, little milk.

54
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,258
- What was I saying?
- John Paul.

55
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:48,080
Oh, yes. Yeah. He said,
"You know what she's like.

56
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,415
She can go off anytime without warning."

57
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:55,838
And I said, "Her screaming at you to stop,
should've rung some alarm bells."

58
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,090
And you know what he said?

59
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:03,053
He said, "I stopped listening
to those Garvey girls years ago."

60
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,265
'Cause they're always screaming
about something."

61
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:10,227
How she sat at the same table as him,
is beyond me.

62
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,312
She is a better woman than I am.

63
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,442
I won't lie, I felt like punching him
every time I saw him.

64
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,698
- Hola!
- Hola!

65
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,824
Hola, chicas.

66
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,492
Hello again, Becka.

67
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:30,080
- Hi. Good to see you.
- Hey. How are you?

68
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,790
We've taken up enough time.

69
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,585
That's fair play.

70
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,296
That's loads of goals.

71
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,382
- Bye, Rubs.
- Bye.

72
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,884
You're welcome, my dear.

73
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,594
See you next time.

74
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,762
- Good doing business with ya.
- See you.

75
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,682
Oh, my God. Becka.

76
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,684
"Oh, my God" what? What happened?

77
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,769
You happened.

78
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:57,065
You need to throw that fish
back in the sea and let him swim far away.

79
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,692
I know, I know.

80
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,321
I didn't know who he was, I swear.

81
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:05,199
When did you even... Does Eva know?

82
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,910
No. And please, please don't tell her.
I'm begging you.

83
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,995
Promise me you won't see him again.

84
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,416
Swear to me. Say it aloud.

85
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,584
I swear.

86
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,295
Oh, my God.

87
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,007
Would you stop stealing people's rubbish?

88
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,611
Stop lying to yourself. Don't you remember
the tagline from that movie?

89
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,678
- Stop, Tom.
- "Never let her out of your sight."

90
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,805
Never relax on duty."

91
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,599
- What?
- "Never fall in love."

92
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,101
I'm not, all right?
That door is well closed.

93
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,687
Didn't look closed there.

94
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,112
How's my favorite beach ball?

95
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,405
What?

96
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,578
I should've been here.

97
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,288
Blood pressure's gone down slightly.

98
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,875
Slightly? But it's supposed to be
less than 120 over 80.

99
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,438
- Was there protein in her urine?
- I haven't checked her urine.

100
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,065
Okay. I think you should check her urine.

101
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,174
Maybe we should take your blood pressure.

102
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,801
Odds are, it's higher than mine.

103
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,094
All right, I'm gonna head off,

104
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,614
but the second it shoots back up,
you call your midwife. Okay?

105
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,390
Next time, we're taking you in.

106
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,268
Keeping her nice and calm is your one job.
Okay, Daddy?

107
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,062
Having a little stress bunny
hopping about doesn't help.

108
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,730
- I'll see you.
- Thank you.

109
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,860
I wanted to check in before
I'm heading off.

110
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:23,986
No. Hang on, Matt.

111
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,574
You know what would keep me
nice and calm? A kebab and chips.

112
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,368
Of course. Hey, Matt. Would you go
to the chipper and go get some...

113
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,911
No, no. You go.

114
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:37,040
You know my order. He'll get it arseways.
Do you mind, petal?

115
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,917
No, it's fine. I can get it.

116
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,086
Matt will stay with me until you get back.

117
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,714
Large or small?

118
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,842
That's a joke. It's always large.

119
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:56,977
What's going on, Matt?

120
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,104
With what?

121
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:02,065
"With what?" The weather.
The bloody Williams case.

122
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,817
He's convinced something's off.

123
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:04,985
And is it?

124
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,363
I don't know. Maybe.

125
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,075
Well, it has to end one way or another.
Have you seen the color of his skin?

126
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,536
The man is gray.
That is not a good look for a ginger.

127
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,955
- Yeah, I know. He's very into it.
- Yeah.

128
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,167
How much is the payout exactly?

129
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,335
The payout?

130
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:23,754
It's…

131
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,090
It's 875,000 euro.

132
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,675
Do you know how I know that?

133
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,261
Because it was written
on the back of an envelope 22 times.

134
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,447
I have been trying, Theresa.

135
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:35,515
Yeah, but you agree.
I shouldn't know this figure, you should.

136
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:37,659
He's trying to protect me, I get it.

137
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,770
So you have to help me
get to the bottom of it.

138
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,914
I'd say the file is in the bottom drawer
of his desk.

139
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,375
- It's the only one he bothers locking.
- You're pre... I think you...

140
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,236
And the key is in the football mug
on the desk.

141
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:51,949
The password is "Polo1998,"
but replace the o's with zeros, right?

142
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,033
- You got it?
- Yes.

143
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,493
Right. Say it back to me.

144
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,788
It's Polo1998.

145
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,582
Polo. Polo, it's Dad's dog.

146
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,376
I know. White with…

147
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,460
- A hole.
- …a hole.

148
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,545
Yeah.

149
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,589
Why are you still standing here?

150
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,675
- You want me to do it now?
- Yes.

151
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:10,884
Okay. Yeah.

152
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,095
Jesus.

153
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,529
"Tom, I'm sorry to leave like this."

154
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,910
I've messed it all up.

155
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,621
"This is the only way I know how to fix it.
Dad."

156
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:56,782
- Morning, Tom.
- Hi. Morning, Liz. You fancy a chip?

157
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,743
- No, thank you.
- No, too early? Get those steps in.

158
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,996
What are you doing out here?
Is Theresa all right?

159
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,207
Fuck.

160
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,501
What did you do that for?

161
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,628
I found the letter from Dad.

162
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,817
What are you doing
going through me stuff, Matt? Please...

163
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:14,925
Please, don't. Don't.

164
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,139
Matt.

165
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,606
So, no accidental overdose?

166
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:31,942
No.

167
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,570
He intended to die.

168
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,950
Fuck.

169
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,827
And those policies in the bottom drawer?

170
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,911
Never filed.

171
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:48,458
He took his clients' money
year after year. And spent it.

172
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,672
Liam Claffin was a crook.

173
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:56,466
And a liar.

174
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,512
We can't pay the claim.

175
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,434
And if we don't find a way out,
it's gonna blow open for...

176
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,603
How could you not tell me, Tom?

177
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:08,896
I don't know.

178
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:12,733
For Dad?

179
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,235
For you?

180
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,905
That's how he did it.

181
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,783
Dad would live large, and me and Mom
would pick up the mess.

182
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,327
And you, well... You...

183
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,205
What? I was just the stupid kid
who made more of a mess for you?

184
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:29,791
No. No. But...
You know, you brought the sunshine.

185
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,169
That was your job.
I was there all seasons.

186
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,087
Anyway, it's done now.

187
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,483
So, if it comes out, we'll go to jail
for covering up his mess...

188
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:37,716
Jesus Christ.

189
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,552
Why did you have to
go and play the martyr?

190
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,387
You could've let him take the fall.

191
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:45,098
- I couldn't. I could...
- No, you could, Tom. You could.

192
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:48,435
And if you had told me at the time,
instead of treating me like a child,

193
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,020
I could've told you that.

194
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,565
I could've hit you over your stupid head

195
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:56,401
and told you that your father
had no right to ask you that.

196
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,654
- Hey, he's your dad too.
- No, he isn't.

197
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,240
He isn't anything anymore.

198
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,329
And now we have this shit show
to deal with.

199
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:11,375
Matt.

200
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,419
Please. I'm sorry.

201
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,287
You gonna let me in?

202
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:04,511
What are you doing here?

203
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:12,728
I don't know.

204
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,153
I can't.

205
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,490
I thought you said you wanted this.

206
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,910
It's complicated.

207
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,039
It's my sisters.

208
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:38,587
Doesn't matter.

209
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,262
Thank you.

210
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,346
There you go.

211
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:34,142
Will the Hardy Boys be back?

212
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:38,480
No, they just wanted
to talk about the crash with JP.

213
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,817
Was it hard talking about it?

214
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,026
I don't know.

215
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,404
You did all the talking, Nora.

216
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,282
You may as well
have put a target on my back.

217
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,658
What target?

218
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:50,742
Doesn't matter.

219
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:55,122
Sorry, Bi.
I just got, like, a dose of the rants.

220
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,166
Forget it.

221
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,378
I just hate giving the prick more airtime.

222
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,506
I really wish he never existed.

223
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,634
Do I sound toxic?

224
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,179
You're allowed to hate him.

225
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,139
I do.

226
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:18,395
I'm glad he's dead. I really am.

227
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,025
Yeah, me too.

228
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,579
I deleted the photo.

229
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:39,082
I smashed his phone, Urs.
The photo's gone, you're safe.

230
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,960
Come on, don't be naive.
He'll have copied it somewhere.

231
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:45,964
But he's not gonna tell Donal.
He likes the power over you too much.

232
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,341
Did you tell Ben?

233
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,510
Fuck no. I can't, he's a Scorpio.

234
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,179
I don't know what that means.

235
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:56,934
It means…
God. I should end it, but I can't.

236
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:00,229
I'm just... I'm just so tired.

237
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,064
Come here. I know.

238
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:04,398
Come on.

239
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,736
What are you hugging it out for?

240
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,030
Just... Oh, shit.

241
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,623
- Grace.
- Straight to Baby B.

242
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,375
She always goes for the childless.

243
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,963
Sorry. I just meant that she knows
there's a better chance you'll answer.

244
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:29,508
Fine. I prefer "child-free," actually.

245
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,593
Hey, Grace. You're on speakerphone.

246
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:33,262
Hey, we're just going to Forty Foot.

247
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,389
Good for ye.

248
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:39,768
Look, I'm calling because you didn't reply
on the group about JP's birthday.

249
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:41,228
Paintballing.

250
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,855
Today fortnight?

251
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:47,276
Donal's working, so I'm on kids.
Sorry, love.

252
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,446
I... Is that in a fortnight?

253
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,949
- 'Cause I think I've got the...
- It's a great idea.

254
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,200
Is that Bibi?

255
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,370
Yeah, Nora can take all of the kids.
Free up Ursula.

256
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:01,415
Well, I meant to say, Urs,
Donal did tell JP he can come.

257
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,041
So, it's a date.

258
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,044
Yeah, I forgot how much you like
shooting things.

259
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:07,629
I do.

260
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,692
- Do you wanna come for a dip?
- Yeah, we'll wait for you.

261
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,384
I can't.

262
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:17,097
I need to get ahead on lunch.
But we'll speak soon though, yeah?

263
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,057
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

264
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:22,186
- Bye-bye.
- Why, Bibi? Bibi!

265
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,256
- Hey, Blanaid. What you doing?
- Just making plans.

266
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,175
Yeah? Anything exci…

267
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,722
I'll meet you there,
but don't do something without me.

268
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,060
Ask first. See what your mam says.

269
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:20,661
You wanna kill him at paintball?
It's a crazy idea.

270
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,871
Well, let's just talk about it.

271
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:25,707
Those things are fecking dangerous
if you hit the right place.

272
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,794
It's the perfect cover.
And my aim is gold.

273
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,439
What if we shoot him
in the back of the throat?

274
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:34,341
Yeah. Let's just ask him
to open his mouth and say...

275
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,592
In the temple, then.

276
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:38,303
You don't want to bruise the man.
I can do that with my fist.

277
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:40,097
In his creepy little head hole.

278
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,933
Yeah! The one from the car crash.

279
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,727
- His fontanel.
- Oh, please don't call it his fontanel.

280
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:47,646
It makes me picture him as a baby.

281
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:51,316
I've actually seen pictures of him
as a baby, and he was a prick even then.

282
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,610
- He liked drowning frogs.
- What?

283
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:56,822
Yeah. Minna used to dress him up
in girls' clothes.

284
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:59,199
In his dead sister's clothes.

285
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:00,284
Jesus God.

286
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:04,037
Do you think you could get X-rays
from work?

287
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,122
It won't be easy.

288
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,165
Nothing worthwhile comes easy, girleen.

289
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:09,209
Excuse me, Dad.

290
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,336
We've got two weeks. Can you get them?

291
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,714
Yeah.

292
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:16,300
I think his head hole
is somewhere here, at the back.

293
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,778
So if the fates are with us,
it won't be covered by his mask.

294
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:21,156
If it is, we could use itching powder.
So he has to take it off.

295
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,058
Jesus. The minute you bring itching powder
into the conversation, it's game over.

296
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:28,353
I don't know. It could be our plan B.
"B" for Baby Becka.

297
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:31,732
- "B" for Bitch-face Bibi.
- Oh, my God.

298
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,902
- Becka! I'm stronger than you.
- Bibi! Bibi!

299
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:37,237
- I'm older. I'm stronger.
- How do you drown a frog?

300
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:38,447
In milk.

301
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,574
No, Bibi. No.

302
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,737
Sweet mother of... That...

303
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:52,062
What?

304
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:57,693
Fuck.

305
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:04,783
Mammy, I need you
to make my office birthday cake.

306
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:08,704
Gerald loves chocolate,
and you do the best chocolate cakes.

307
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:11,540
You should take Friday off
for your birthday.

308
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:12,749
Mammy, I'm not ten.

309
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,377
I thought we could do something.

310
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,089
A financial director does not
take time off for his birthday.

311
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:23,343
You will have to make it today though,

312
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:26,555
'cause tomorrow's the only day
that Gerald's gonna be in this week.

313
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:29,433
Where's the... Thank you.

314
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,351
Okay. I'll do it after.

315
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:33,645
After my class.

316
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:38,662
What kind of chocolate cake
would you like?

317
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:39,693
The rich one.

318
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:42,571
The one you did last year with the...
With the raspberries,

319
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:45,115
and that... French word?

320
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:47,868
Ganache.

321
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,411
Ganache.

322
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:52,164
Ganache. Gerald loves the ganache.

323
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:56,668
I'll make it after lunch and let it cool
while I'm at my class.

324
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,087
What class?

325
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:03,383
I'm taking dancing classes.

326
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,637
You know, just to do something.

327
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:08,805
Good for you, Mum.

328
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,267
Well, it's just a small thing.

329
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:14,311
Well, that's all you have time for.

330
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:16,897
You can go full Lizzo on it.

331
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,317
Might get myself a leotard.

332
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,693
Slut drops.

333
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:25,656
No.

334
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,042
You little flea sack.

335
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:44,716
You like that?

336
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:21,753
Hello, everybody. Welcome back
to the second week of Afro-Ceilidh chaos.

337
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:23,755
We have some gorgeous new faces this week.

338
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,968
So just to explain the warm-up,
we're gonna form a lovely loose circle.

339
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:30,804
Brilliant.

340
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,725
Great. And we're each gonna
take a turn in the middle

341
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:36,810
to introduce ourselves through dance,

342
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:39,605
and the outgoing dancer
selects the incoming.

343
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:40,689
Okay.

344
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:46,904
Okay. Come on, guys.
Let's move however feels good.

345
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:54,578
Come on. Who's up next? Go, Toby.

346
00:24:57,998 --> 00:24:58,998
Yay.

347
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,506
That's it. Go with the music.

348
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,343
Good luck. Yay.

349
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:24,650
Come on.

350
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,177
I'm sorry. I can't.

351
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:24,585
No.

352
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,964
You don't do anything,
and when you do, you do this.

353
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:31,091
- Bla. I'm so sorry.
- No!

354
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:32,759
Honey, I'm so...

355
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:35,345
Go gentle, go gentle. Accidents happen.

356
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,598
Oh, God. Oh, my goodness.

357
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,450
Especially when you have
a Garvey girl in the car.

358
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:40,893
- I hate you, Mum.
- Sweetheart.

359
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:46,982
You shovel him up while I park the car.

360
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,817
We'll bury him next to Oscar. Okay?

361
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:55,199
Can a skull look smug?

362
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:58,827
That's his head hole right there.

363
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:00,370
Okay.

364
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:11,048
Okay.

365
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:13,258
Hang on.

366
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:27,851
Well, I haven't been able to practice,
because I can't take this out at home.

367
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,910
Stop doing that.
Looking at each other with those faces.

368
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,083
And it's not my eye.
You don't need two eyes to aim.

369
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:50,838
It's all about the stance.
The grip. Breath.

370
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:54,132
Will you have time to do all that? 'Cause
it's gonna be very frantic on the day.

371
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:57,278
Can I just hit it first
before you start dismantling the plan?

372
00:27:57,302 --> 00:28:01,473
No one's dismantling the plan. Okay?
Just take your time.

373
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:03,100
- It will come back.
- Yeah.

374
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:09,940
I'm just gonna move a bit.

375
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:23,704
Bull's-eye!

376
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,504
No, Father. There was no penetration.

377
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:36,049
Yeah. I...

378
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:38,760
I think we're gonna have to
give it another thinkety-think.

379
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:41,072
You know, because,
I mean, hitting the target is one thing.

380
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:42,681
But if it's not even leaving a dent…

381
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,964
What a surprise.
We're not gonna paintball him to death.

382
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:49,855
I have to go to work.

383
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,983
And I have to go to my studio.

384
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:55,402
Oh, no, wait. I don't have a studio.

385
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,571
Bibi.

386
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:03,535
Do you want some watermelon?

387
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,913
- Yeah.
- Got some feta.

388
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:13,045
So, when do I get to meet
the rest of the Spice Girls then?

389
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:15,547
There is a scary one actually.
And a baby one.

390
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,217
And a ginger one, but sometimes.

391
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,885
So you're either Posh or Sporty.

392
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:22,596
I'm Posh with a capital "P."

393
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,139
There's no sporty ones.

394
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:27,226
And we're all good at downing wine
if that's a sport? Is that a sport?

395
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:28,769
If so, I'm an athlete.

396
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:32,147
Oh, my God.

397
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,025
It's not even his birthday until Friday.

398
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:37,110
Don't deny the big boy his birth week.

399
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:45,077
Old family recipe.

400
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,371
Well, such heirlooms are priceless.

401
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:51,834
I was thinking about
taking the boat out for my birthday.

402
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:57,631
Bayliner 2566 model, 27 feet.

403
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:59,758
I thought, perhaps,
you might like to join me?

404
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:01,718
I'm surrounded by women at home.

405
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:04,471
So,
I could really use some proper man time.

406
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:05,973
Uh-huh.

407
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:08,767
We've had some good times on there.

408
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:13,647
Suits you.

409
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:15,566
Yeah.

410
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:21,655
Well, what goes on tour stays on tour.

411
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:23,282
Sailor's honor.

412
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:26,243
Needless to say,
you'll be afforded the same honor.

413
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:29,538
Not that you or I
would drink to that excess.

414
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:32,583
- Didn't think she would either.
- What?

415
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,796
Well, as Grace says about her sponge cake,
"perfect until it collapses."

416
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:41,300
Anyway, we're all human, right?

417
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:45,137
So, enjoy, and I'll let you know
when she's ready for high seas…

418
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,221
- The same size?
- …okay?

419
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:48,307
- Well, yeah.
- I'm sorry.

420
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,227
So, we should get sporty.

421
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:53,437
Yeah?

422
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,105
Like hand-to-mouth drills?

423
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:57,816
- Yeah, exactly. Like, build those arms up.
- Okay.

424
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:01,987
- Or maybe squeeze in some culture first.
- Really? Do we have to?

425
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,449
Okay, we'll do a quick lap
around the National Gallery.

426
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:07,177
- Yeah.
- We'll just get the bloods flowing.

427
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:09,578
Yeah. Shall I wear a sweatband?

428
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:11,914
Well, do you have matching wristbands?

429
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:15,000
- Naturally.
- Well, then, of course.

430
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,460
- Okay.
- Okay.

431
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:19,129
And your little shorts. Not really.

432
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:20,714
Shit.

433
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:23,425
You can't go around hitting people
in your class, Ruben.

434
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:25,427
You broke his glasses.

435
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:27,513
Okay. Well, let's just leave it for now.

436
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:29,473
You could have done permanent damage.

437
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:30,557
Jesus, Ruben!

438
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,521
Tell me why you hit him.
Or I'll burn your comics.

439
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:38,541
- And your trading cards.
- No, she's not gonna burn your comics.

440
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:40,943
- What about my trading cards?
- Or your trading cards.

441
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:43,862
- You better not.
- Ruben!

442
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:45,531
I didn't do anything wrong!

443
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,699
What are we meant to do so?

444
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:50,903
You're supposed to wait until you're calm,
till you decide on the consequences.

445
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,038
We'll be waiting a while then.

446
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,669
We're doing
this positive parenting course.

447
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:01,004
We had to do a personality assessment.

448
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:03,048
My profile was…

449
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:05,592
superior and controlling.

450
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:06,718
Nailed it!

451
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:08,470
What about Nora?

452
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,430
Pleasing and comforting.

453
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:12,850
She really is though.

454
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:17,729
You know what I thought? I thought,
"She's Grace, and I'm the prick."

455
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:20,732
You're not the prick, Bibi.

456
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,443
You'll never be the prick.

457
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:26,572
Do you think for a second
he's assessing his parenting skills?

458
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:28,115
Wondering how he can do better?

459
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:29,199
Not a chance.

460
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:31,577
Blanaid's not being raised
by a one-eyed lesbian though.

461
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:34,162
I'm on the back foot, Eva.

462
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:35,873
Have to get this right.

463
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:36,999
Listen to me.

464
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:42,004
You can't handle your drink, okay?
You're a terrible cinema date,

465
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:45,757
and you're one of the worst poker partners
I've ever had. Ever.

466
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:48,468
You're one of the best parents I know.

467
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:52,097
Probably... You know, probably the best.

468
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:54,808
Just don't tell Ursula that.

469
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:01,690
And, you know, when you think about
what poor Blanaid's been damned with.

470
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:04,234
Not Grace obviously, although...

471
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:08,822
You are the opposite of that.
You are a light for Ruben.

472
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:15,787
Ursula says she wishes
Ben had seen her in all her glory.

473
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:19,124
Body-wise, you know.
Before kids and gravity.

474
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:26,089
Ruben won't remember me. Before…

475
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,761
That doesn't make you
any less of a parent.

476
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:33,889
Okay?

477
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:38,018
Maybe one eye less of a parent.

478
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:48,946
I'm not gonna give up, Eva.

479
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:52,783
I will kill him.

480
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,829
But this is for Grace, remember?

481
00:33:57,913 --> 00:33:59,373
And Blanaid.

482
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:01,500
That's why we're doing this, right?

483
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:05,254
Yeah, but we'll all be better off.

484
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:07,506
Revenge is toxic.

485
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:13,094
It's all right for you.
He didn't ruin your life.

486
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:29,277
I love this one.

487
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,029
Me too.

488
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,739
The heartbreak of forbidden love.

489
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:40,831
She can't bear to look at him.
And then he'll take any part of her.

490
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:46,210
You ever had a forbidden love?

491
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:51,884
- A courtier never tells.
- You have.

492
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:56,722
So, were you a culture-vulture in Paris?

493
00:34:57,222 --> 00:34:58,765
I was more into antique fairs.

494
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:01,476
God, you should come to my house.

495
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,396
I've got the old family home
full of antiques.

496
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,647
So you've never left?

497
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:07,566
No. I grew old in that house.

498
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:10,777
You must have a painting in your attic.

499
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:13,363
Fuck off.

500
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:17,659
Compliment accepted
like a true Irish woman. Yeah.

501
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:19,411
My mother used to…

502
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:21,705
- To?
- It's Ciaran.

503
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:23,874
Eva.

504
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,043
- Hey.
- Wow.

505
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:30,172
- How are you?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

506
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:32,466
- Yeah, very good.
- Right.

507
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,010
Sorry. This is my...

508
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:36,887
This is Nadia.

509
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:37,846
- Hi.
- Hi.

510
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,348
Boys, come on over.

511
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:43,644
This is Conor, and this is Tom.

512
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,980
Hi. Hi, I'm Gabriel.

513
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:48,732
- Hi, Gabriel.
- Hey.

514
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:49,650
Hi.

515
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:50,817
- Hello.
- Hi.

516
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:52,569
We've just come from a workshop.

517
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:54,797
We had to choose our favorite paintings
and paint them.

518
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:56,031
And yours?

519
00:35:56,782 --> 00:35:59,076
That is William Mackinnon's Hope.

520
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:01,119
That's my favorite.

521
00:36:01,203 --> 00:36:03,038
It's my daddy's too.

522
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:05,707
Yeah.

523
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:11,088
- Well, we should be leaving, shouldn't we?
- Yeah, I was gonna... Because we have...

524
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:13,799
- Bye.
- Bye.

525
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:15,384
- Bye.
- Bye, Eva.

526
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,888
An old boyfriend?

527
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:21,849
Yeah. Old.

528
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:24,268
Ten-years-ago old.

529
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:26,520
Hard one to recover from?

530
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:29,273
Yeah. I mean…

531
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:31,024
It was proper, you know?

532
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:33,110
We were going to have a family together
and…

533
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:35,195
What happened?

534
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:40,284
Sad story. I'm not super fertile.

535
00:36:42,077 --> 00:36:45,414
Didn't... Didn't deal with it very well.

536
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:56,258
Come on. Let's go drink
criminal amounts of brandy.

537
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:57,551
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

538
00:36:57,634 --> 00:37:00,012
- Fuck culture.
- Yeah. Who needs it anyway?

539
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:01,763
Not us sporty types.

540
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,103
Show me them one more time.

541
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:12,399
Consent to kiss the guns?

542
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,077
The boy I hit is stupid.

543
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:27,122
Why is he stupid?

544
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:30,584
Tell me.

545
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:32,794
He was calling you Cyclops.

546
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:36,215
So you were defending my honor?

547
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:38,717
No?

548
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:40,886
Cyclops is a man.

549
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,680
He has an optical blast
that can burn through anything.

550
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,517
You're just a mum.

551
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,393
With one eye.

552
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:52,564
No, I have an optical blast.

553
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:55,692
I use it on Principal Ní Mheara.

554
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,653
Does it work?

555
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:01,365
Blast through her nonsense all the time.

556
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:02,866
So you are a super mum?

557
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:07,037
Yeah. Yes, I am.

558
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:46,451
Thanks for this.

559
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:49,705
When the third taxi cancels,
you start to take it personally.

560
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:52,207
No problem.

561
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:55,377
I don't want you to be late.

562
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,460
I'm not in a hurry.

563
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:02,926
What's with the nerves?
Because of your parents, is it?

564
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,679
Listen, cars are a lot safer these days.

565
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:09,266
And there was absolutely no need
for that accident to be fatal.

566
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,935
And your dad was a reckless driver.

567
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:14,271
I mean, I'm all about safety, you know?

568
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:16,440
Can you stop the car? I wanna get out.

569
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:18,192
I don't think I can.

570
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:25,616
- Stop the car!
- No, stop it! Wait!

571
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,993
- Stop the car! Stop the car!
- No. Let go.

572
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:50,807
Bull's-eye.

573
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,681
I think you might have been right
about the dance classes.

574
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:05,572
Was it awful, Mammy?

575
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:08,867
I thought I could dance.

576
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:11,703
I thought it would make me feel…

577
00:40:13,455 --> 00:40:14,581
It was…

578
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:19,628
But you are not a showgirl.

579
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:23,507
You're a queen.

580
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:28,929
This is your kingdom.

581
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:33,100
And when you leave bad things happen.

582
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:36,186
We need you here.

583
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:45,863
I need to get up to speed
on these accounts.

584
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:54,872
It's been so long, JP. We should.

585
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:02,254
Try tomorrow, Mammy.

586
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:06,466
- Try tomorrow.
- Yeah.

587
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:38,540
Why do you live on a boat?

588
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:45,506
Your boat is rocking me.

589
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:47,549
I'm gonna use your pole.

590
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:49,927
This is a bit fatter than my normal pole...

591
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,682
Are you okay?

592
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:19,790
Wait.

593
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:21,917
Maybe... Maybe we shouldn't.

594
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,001
It's okay.

595
00:42:29,383 --> 00:42:30,717
Hey.

596
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:36,849
Oh, God.

597
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:38,559
Wait, stop.

598
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:46,483
Is it me?

599
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:48,735
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Jesus. No. It's me.

600
00:42:52,155 --> 00:42:54,408
I'm not into women, Eva.

601
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,248
And if I was,
I'd be into you literally right now.

602
00:43:07,963 --> 00:43:08,964
Right.

603
00:43:12,176 --> 00:43:14,595
Why did you string me along then?

604
00:43:14,678 --> 00:43:16,555
Well, I didn't mean to.

605
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:17,890
I mean, not like that.

606
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:20,517
I just really enjoy hanging out.

607
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:22,537
You're very beautiful.
You're funny. You're smart.

608
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:26,190
Yeah, but if I'd have...
If I'd have known, you know?

609
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:28,400
- If I'd have jus...
- Oh, no.

610
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:30,694
This is awful!

611
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:32,738
What do you mean?
No, it's not. It's great.

612
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:35,574
- It means we can be proper friends.
- Shut up.

613
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:36,742
Okay.

614
00:43:36,825 --> 00:43:39,369
I mean, why aren't you out?

615
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,749
I mean, this is Ireland 2022.

616
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:47,294
We're a bit
fucking progressive these days.

617
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:48,378
I know.

618
00:43:48,462 --> 00:43:51,798
I just like to keep
my private and work life separate.

619
00:43:51,882 --> 00:43:52,966
Fucking shoe.

620
00:43:53,842 --> 00:43:56,237
Well, I wish I had done the same.
I don't know what I was thinking.

621
00:43:56,261 --> 00:43:57,638
Don't go. Stay over, please.

622
00:43:58,222 --> 00:43:59,890
I feel so stupid.

623
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,091
You could have...

624
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:38,720
You could have given me
a sign or something.

625
00:44:38,804 --> 00:44:40,722
Like, hold up a sign, "I'm gay"?

626
00:44:40,806 --> 00:44:46,061
No. But a bloody…
bloody rainbow. You know?

627
00:44:46,144 --> 00:44:49,356
A bloody little rainbow ribbon thing.

628
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,608
Medal.

629
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:56,613
Come here.

630
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:11,670
You know when you asked me earlier
if I've ever had a forbidden love?

631
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:15,424
I did.

632
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,301
More than one.

633
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:22,681
'Cause it was all forbidden.

634
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:27,269
And for my family, nothing was...

635
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:31,356
What's the word?

636
00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:35,110
Permissible?

637
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:36,695
Yeah, that's the word.

638
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:40,490
I mean, you could have
gone for a simpler word.

639
00:45:40,574 --> 00:45:44,661
Like, "allowed" or "okay."

640
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:50,501
I'm sorry you had a tough time
with your family.

641
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:17,611
Oh, no!

642
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:35,712
I'm gonna freeze the little fuckers.

643
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,681
Okay.

644
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:55,232
There she is!

645
00:46:56,275 --> 00:46:59,444
- What's all the panic about?
- No panic. We're on.

646
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:02,114
Look what she did. Look at that!

647
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:04,116
I nailed my aim and froze the pellets.

648
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:07,035
I can now get it through his thick skull.

649
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:09,514
We just need to work out
how to swap them out.

650
00:47:09,538 --> 00:47:11,432
But how do you know
what kind of pellets they use?

651
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:13,917
I rang them.
Played the obsessive enthusiast.

652
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:17,045
They use .68s and masks, not helmets.

653
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:19,423
So, his head hole will be exposed.

654
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:22,050
Yeah. I mean, there's still some things
to figure out, but...

655
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:25,137
Yeah, but it... The pellet's going through.
That's a start.

656
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,306
There was penetration, Father.

657
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:31,018
- You need to hit the exact spot...
- Oh, my God. I can do this!

658
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:34,563
I know I do because I don't ever fail
when I want something this much.

659
00:47:34,646 --> 00:47:36,356
- Ask Nora.
- You told Nora?

660
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,774
Of course not.

661
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:43,113
Once we're up and running,
I will find a quiet spot,

662
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:44,823
swap in the frozen pellets…

663
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:48,410
and shoot the prick dead.

664
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:51,579
Now, listen.

665
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:53,457
This is how it's gonna go.

666
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:56,710
Their regular session is two teams
against each other.

667
00:47:57,336 --> 00:48:01,089
Let's put Donal with JP.
JP will love that. Boys against girls.

668
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:07,095
So, team A will be
JP, Donal, Ursula and Grace.

669
00:48:07,596 --> 00:48:10,224
Team B: me, Eva and Becka.

670
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:14,520
Urs, you'll keep Donal and Grace
away from me and Eva.

671
00:48:14,603 --> 00:48:16,522
Eva, you and I will target JP.

672
00:48:16,605 --> 00:48:19,274
Make him feel like
we're his real opposition out there.

673
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:22,611
- Well, what do I do then?
- Just don't get in the way.

674
00:48:22,694 --> 00:48:25,113
- Over there.
- Come on.

675
00:48:25,656 --> 00:48:28,158
What are we waiting for? Let's go!

676
00:48:29,993 --> 00:48:35,624
Good morning, everyone.
My name is Cyril, aka, Cyril the squirrel.

677
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:38,335
Because I know and love every cubic inch
of these woods

678
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:40,671
so please, respect them.

679
00:48:41,922 --> 00:48:43,257
Also, I like nuts.

680
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,718
Rule number one, never take off your mask.

681
00:48:46,802 --> 00:48:48,887
If you do,
you'll go straight to the sin bin.

682
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:51,181
Everyone understand?

683
00:48:51,723 --> 00:48:53,350
- Yes.
- Good.

684
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:54,726
Okay.

685
00:48:55,561 --> 00:48:59,481
Special request from the birthday boy
who's organized his own surprise.

686
00:49:00,148 --> 00:49:03,193
So, today, instead of playing
our normal two-player teams,

687
00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:06,530
we'll be playing a game
called "Shoot the Bunny."

688
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:08,240
Shoot the what?

689
00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:13,120
One of you will have
a rabbit's foot in your breast pocket.

690
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:25,007
It's you, Mammy.

691
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,676
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fun.
Just run, run, run.

692
00:49:27,759 --> 00:49:30,095
You're good, and you're fast.
You can do it.

693
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:31,013
Bunny!

694
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:33,408
It's your job to try and get
from one side of the obstacle course

695
00:49:33,432 --> 00:49:34,933
to the other without getting hit.

696
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:38,478
- Okay? All understand?
- Okay.

697
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:40,189
Are we all ready?

698
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:42,816
Yes.

699
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,276
Then please follow me.

700
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,118
What now?

701
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:57,831
Improvise.

702
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:01,835
- Come on, Ursula! Over here.
- Becka, come on.

703
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:27,361
You and I follow JP.

704
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:58,475
Now, Bibi. While he has his back to us.

705
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:02,729
Come on!

706
00:51:08,694 --> 00:51:10,279
Oh, shit.

707
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:12,072
Fuck.

708
00:51:12,155 --> 00:51:14,408
What now? Bibi.

709
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:15,492
Follow me.

710
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:17,703
Okay.

711
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:25,377
I found you, Mammy.

712
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:28,630
Look at him. Bastard.

713
00:51:29,214 --> 00:51:32,885
Run. Can't hide.

714
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:33,969
Prick.

715
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:40,517
Stop. Go back! Go!

716
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:43,270
Stay out of the way, Becka.

717
00:51:44,479 --> 00:51:45,479
Oh, shit.

718
00:51:54,072 --> 00:51:55,699
Lead him over there. That way, that way.

719
00:51:55,782 --> 00:51:56,950
Okay.

720
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:12,758
- Hi there!
- All right, lads.

721
00:52:13,926 --> 00:52:17,012
Give me five minutes there,
and we'll get you on no bother.

722
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:19,723
You've got a clear shot!

723
00:52:19,806 --> 00:52:21,350
Bibi, do it.

724
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:31,777
Do it, Bibi.

725
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:34,238
Five minutes.

726
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:40,327
Go on!

727
00:52:45,457 --> 00:52:46,792
Somebody call an ambulance!

728
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:53,507
Don't move. Try to stay still for me,
mate. That's it. Just stay on your back.

729
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:58,303
- Stay calm. Calm down.
- Just try to keep your hand by your side.

730
00:52:58,387 --> 00:53:01,265
I'm Donal, I'm a paramedic.
This is Ursula, she's a nurse.

731
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:04,601
We're gonna look after you. Okay?
Try not to touch your eye. That's it.

732
00:53:05,143 --> 00:53:08,522
- That's it. Just breathe.
- Take deep breaths, Cyril. In.

733
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:11,275
- We promise you it'll be okay.
- Bibi.

734
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:12,359
Bibi.

735
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:15,195
Did somebody call an ambulance?

736
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:18,574
What's going on?

737
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:24,204
- What happened?
- Don't scream, Mammy.

738
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:30,752
Keep breathing.

739
00:53:30,836 --> 00:53:31,837
What the fuck?

740
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,339
That's it. In. Doing good.

741
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:36,425
You're doing great.
You're doing great, Cyril.

742
00:53:36,508 --> 00:53:39,261
I'd like you to stay with me.
You can hear me, can't you?

743
00:53:44,474 --> 00:53:46,059
No, no, no.

744
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:52,524
No, no, no, no, no, no.
