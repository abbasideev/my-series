1
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,082
What are you looking at?

2
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,796
Come on. She needs us.

3
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:48,632
Let's go inside.

4
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:52,553
So they found him,
crashed up against the tree.

5
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,346
He was cold.

6
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,349
Dead for hours.

7
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,310
Dead for hours, Eva.

8
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,693
Oh, my God.

9
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,653
Grace, I'm so sorry.

10
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,405
- What happened?
- We don't fucking know.

11
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,323
Sorry.

12
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,719
- Do you want some tea, Urs?
- No, she doesn't want tea.

13
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,221
She doesn't... Someone should make you tea.

14
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,956
- Becka, the...
- No! I'm fucking listening.

15
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:23,876
Go on, Grace.

16
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,212
We had my birthday dinner.

17
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,298
And it was lovely.

18
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:34,094
So I said, "Let's have an early night."

19
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,806
And he just got so angry with me.

20
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:42,352
So, he left. Went off on the bike
to the pub to watch the match, so…

21
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,729
I just went to bed.

22
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,606
I was just...

23
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,483
Just so hurt.

24
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,865
It was my birthday,
and I just wanted to be with my husband.

25
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:59,828
I didn't know why he'd do that to me.
Just leave me like that.

26
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:00,913
Because he was a prick.

27
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,669
Hey. Of course you were hurt, Gracie.

28
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,630
I'm so sorry.

29
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,507
How am I gonna tell Blanaid?

30
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:16,595
He's dead.

31
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,640
He's dead.

32
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,156
Oh, my God!

33
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,293
Poor Gracie.

34
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,073
Oh, God, I don't know how to feel.

35
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,301
I do.

36
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,346
He saved us all a lot of hassle.

37
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,939
Ding-dong, the prick is dead.

38
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,036
Hey. Is she okay?

39
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,288
What's happened?

40
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,249
She needs an emergency C-section.

41
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,460
They don't know if they'll…

42
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,171
Oh, Christ. I'll head over now.

43
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,923
No, I don't need you here.

44
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,884
- Have you a pen?
- Yeah. Hang on.

45
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,182
Have you found a pen?

46
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,935
You sh...
You don't have a pen on your desk.

47
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,645
There'll be a pen there somewhere.

48
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,273
I can't find a pen.

49
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,566
Matt, there's pens.

50
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,901
Look, it's fine. I'll just... Just tell me.
I'll remember.

51
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,027
Fine!

52
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,446
I'm gonna be off radar
for I don't know how long.

53
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,323
Respond to anything in my in-box.

54
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,033
Post Malcolm Tunnoch his GAA tickets.

55
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,887
They're his "thank you" for getting me
the psychiatric report on Williams.

56
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,551
They're on the desk. You can't miss them.

57
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,417
Okay, GAA tickets for Malcolm.

58
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,936
- Anything else?
- I don't know, Matt.

59
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,046
I mean, is there anything else you
can think of before it's all over for us?

60
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,841
Before I'm in a cell?

61
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:46,305
Before some man moves into my home?
Makes my family sever all contact with me.

62
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,640
Not even a wedding photo left on the…

63
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,018
- What are you talking about? What man?
- I don't know.

64
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,221
I couldn't sleep last night.

65
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,272
The future got very dark.
It got very specific.

66
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,025
Look, you're not going to jail,
Thomas, okay?

67
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,944
We know now for sure
Becka wasn't with her sisters.

68
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,613
It's too late for all that now.

69
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,757
We took our eye off the ball.
We should have done more.

70
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,035
We exhumed the body, Tom, for God...
Oh, shit!

71
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,203
Listen, I've gotta go.

72
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,080
Look, just...
Tom, don't worry. Tru... Please trust me.

73
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,916
I have everything under control.

74
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,515
Matt!

75
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,944
Why were you hiding behind your desk?

76
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,488
I wasn't. I was looking for a pen.

77
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,784
I thought you were ghosting me.

78
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,078
You didn't text me back yesterday.

79
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:56,208
No. Just, Thomas is actually...

80
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,503
- Thomas is in hospital.
- Good.

81
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,673
I mean, I'm sorry. That's... Is he okay?

82
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,426
Yeah, no, it's his wife. Their baby.

83
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,972
They have complications,
so I'm gonna head over there in a bit.

84
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,689
So, yeah.

85
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,026
I will call you when I know more.

86
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:38,250
Becka, so I went to that pub
in Wicklow where JP spent his last night.

87
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,628
And the barmaid said she saw you there.

88
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:47,926
So, you and your sisters
weren't together at all, were you?

89
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,096
Barmaid got it wrong.

90
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,222
Right.

91
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,436
How'd those postmortem results
work out for you?

92
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,397
Or did you get that wrong too?

93
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,034
Where the hell is Becka?

94
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,368
She's supposed to be here.

95
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:14,870
She'd better not be with Matt.

96
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,290
Surely she's not following her fanny
at a time like this?

97
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,253
Grace, you okay, honey? You all right?

98
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,172
His walking boots.

99
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,508
I broke these in for him.

100
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,968
I wore them around the house.

101
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,596
Oh, God. He's only just been buried

102
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,058
and I'm boxing up
his life like he was never even here.

103
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,227
He was here all right.

104
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,688
Maybe these would suit Nora?

105
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,983
I don't remember what size she is.

106
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,926
I'm taking offense on Nora's behalf.

107
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,492
We're fucked.

108
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,913
One for Donal?
I think they had the same sense of humor.

109
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,040
Baby Becka.

110
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,794
Grace, we're gonna need more boxes, honey.

111
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,714
Yeah. Hang on.
I'll just pop down to the utility.

112
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,134
This is nice.

113
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,762
I mean, this is awful.

114
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:18,475
I'm packing up me dead husband's clothes,
but, you know.

115
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,565
I just came...

116
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,567
Just, shut up. Get inside.

117
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,068
Get in.

118
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,035
Matt knows we weren't together
the night John Paul died.

119
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:39,305
- How the hell does he know that?
- Why were you with Matt?

120
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,915
I just found him hiding
in his fucking office.

121
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,918
- Oh, Christ. It's over.
- Hiding from me.

122
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:48,130
Look, first of all,
I've had men hide from me, okay?

123
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,233
- Just deal with it.
- He knows I've been lying, Eva.

124
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,258
No, listen.

125
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,427
What if they're onto something?

126
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,556
They firmly believe that someone
was behind John Paul's death, okay?

127
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,893
What if they're right?
What if someone did kill him?

128
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,020
Wha...

129
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,855
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

130
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:10,277
We were just seeing if we could all
fit in your massive wardrobe.

131
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,571
Eat your heart out, Carrie Bradshaw.

132
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,782
Get in here! So big.

133
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:16,867
Honestly.

134
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,703
It's massive.

135
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,110
Why do we keep coming here
if there's no booze?

136
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,237
I fancy a soup.

137
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,656
No soup, no booze.

138
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,449
- I want your alibis.
- What?

139
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,409
Where did you all go that night?

140
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,411
Why are you looking at me?

141
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,622
I was with Ben. You know that.

142
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,542
Well, you could have done it together.
You've both plenty of reasons.

143
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,305
And where were you? Your head's been
all over the place since Minna.

144
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:10,379
Exactly.

145
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,882
The only one mental enough
to do anything on their own is you.

146
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:15,384
And everyone knows it.

147
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:19,221
Actually, Eva,
you said point-blank that you'd do it.

148
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,723
Yeah, well I didn't, okay?

149
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,892
What'd you do with the pento anyway?

150
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,102
It's in my wash-bag.

151
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,895
Where's your wash-bag?

152
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,188
- It's at Ben's.
- It's at Be...

153
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:30,607
It's at Ben's?

154
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,234
But I haven't seen him.

155
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,486
Do you think he might be involved
in any way?

156
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,699
How? He somehow
drugged him and caused him to crash?

157
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,704
Oh, my God.

158
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:47,165
Just go to Ben's, get the pento,
and then get back to mine.

159
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:48,792
Okay.

160
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,377
- Go!
- Okay.

161
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:51,920
Oh, my God.

162
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:54,882
And no sex.

163
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:06,977
Sorry I've not been around to see you.

164
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,357
It's just since, you know, JP died,
I needed to be there for Grace.

165
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,944
The insurance company
are still making it difficult for her.

166
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:17,779
They won't pay out.

167
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,951
They think there's foul play of some kind
in JP's death.

168
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,370
Wouldn't that be poetic.

169
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,791
Where did you go that night?

170
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,003
The night JP died,
you were gone when I woke up.

171
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:37,758
You stopped calling, and you're not
answering any of my text messages.

172
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,471
You once said that
you'd do anything for me.

173
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,432
You think I killed him?

174
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,310
I think people do crazy things
when they're in love.

175
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,395
I'd do the same. I'd do anything for you.

176
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,608
You're so full of shit.

177
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:57,819
- No, I'm no... I'm...
- Come on, Urs.

178
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:01,532
You wouldn't even move into a house
that I wanted to rent for us.

179
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,952
Now, you say you'd kill for me? Come on.

180
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,495
I'm sorry.

181
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:13,001
It repulsed me.
What you asked me to do, it repulsed me.

182
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,087
I didn't ask you to do anything.

183
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,174
We both know
what you wanted me to do that night.

184
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,595
I had to leave that night

185
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,641
because I couldn't bear lying beside you
for another minute.

186
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:30,978
I'm sorry.

187
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:34,648
It's over.

188
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,652
Please.

189
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:45,075
I need this to be over, Urs.

190
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:47,827
Please.

191
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,110
Michael, no.

192
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,321
- No peeping. Think about it…
- Go!

193
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,323
- Dad…
- Don't, Michael!

194
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,996
Michael tried to soak me with the hose.
You'll be next.

195
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,582
You all right? Do you want a cup of tea?

196
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,685
Roger, is it? Matthew Claffin.

197
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,104
Do you mind if I come inside?

198
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,735
Yeah, okay.
Just go around to your left, yeah?

199
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,127
- Please, sit down.
- Yeah. Thank you.

200
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:20,462
Sorry about the mess.

201
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,421
No, you're okay.

202
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:29,763
So I'm dealing with the policy
of a local family, the Williams'.

203
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:34,017
Just doing a bit of background work
before we pay out.

204
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,603
It's standard procedure.

205
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,649
So, you know the family?

206
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,442
Yeah, I did.

207
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:44,528
Not anymore?

208
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,655
Well, he's dead, isn't he?

209
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:48,866
He is.

210
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,453
But not Grace and Blanaid.

211
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:58,584
Yeah, well, it's too late now, isn't it?

212
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,461
What's done is done.

213
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:05,132
That man was the devil incarnate.

214
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:08,635
He accused me of a crime so hateful.

215
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:09,803
Which crime?

216
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,140
Having an unnatural interest in children.

217
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:16,393
I've got nothing but love for children,
but he set the tongues wagging!

218
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,353
My church disowned me!

219
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,691
My duties were taken from me!
My life has fallen apart!

220
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,570
And all for sport. That's all it was.

221
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,531
Just amusement to him.

222
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:33,911
Can I ask you a question?

223
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:39,374
Can you remember where you were
the night John Paul died?

224
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:42,920
Yeah.

225
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,507
I went up to his cabin
the night that he died.

226
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,010
'Cause I knew I couldn't carry around

227
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,930
all this hatred
that was inside me, you see?

228
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,806
I knew I needed to forgive him.

229
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,936
I knew I needed to get back
to the love, you see?

230
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:05,776
You went to the cabin
and John Paul was there?

231
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,113
Pay the woman's claim.

232
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:12,657
It's the least she deserves

233
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:16,869
after all these years spent
with that twisted bastard.

234
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:22,917
I'll tell you what's unnatural,
the interest he had in his sisters-in-law.

235
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:24,586
What do you mean?

236
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,507
I'd like you to leave now, please.

237
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,053
Sure.

238
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,187
Mrs. Williams!

239
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:44,898
Grace!

240
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,233
Some news, I hope.

241
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:49,570
- Yeah, well, sort of. Can I come in?
- No.

242
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:52,614
Sorry, no, I have Blanaid's dinner
to get started, so…

243
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:56,535
Okay, I'm just still a little fuzzy
on a couple of things

244
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,287
I wanted to quickly go over.

245
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,581
So, I went to that pub in Wicklow.

246
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:04,293
Barmaid said she can't be sure
your husband was there or not.

247
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,420
All I know
is he said he went to watch Harps play.

248
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:09,089
And if that's what he said,
then that's what he would have done.

249
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,591
Okay. She said Becka...

250
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:14,261
Your sister, Rebecca,
that she was there, though.

251
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:18,098
So, not with you all as you said.

252
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:21,351
She came late. She's always late.

253
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:24,104
Your neighbor said
your husband accused him of pedophilia.

254
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:29,234
He said he went to the cabin that night
to forgive him. Did you see him there?

255
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:33,280
Your younger sister said
that he financially ruined her,

256
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,324
and he was abusive to his own mother.

257
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:39,912
He wasn't a popular man, was he?

258
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:08,125
God's sake.

259
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:54,630
Shit.

260
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,219
For God's sake.

261
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,939
Leave a message for Thomas Claffin.

262
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:59,945
Thomas, Grace told me JP was going
to the pub to watch the match,

263
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,531
but the match was the night after.
It was the Saturday.

264
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:06,451
I just checked those tickets for Malcolm,
those fixtures are always on a Saturday.

265
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:09,037
JP definitely lied to her.

266
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,040
Why would he lie?

267
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,167
Where the hell have you been?

268
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:59,755
Oh, no, take your time, Urs.

269
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:02,257
It's only our entire lives
on the line here.

270
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:09,515
Ben didn't do it.

271
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,977
What did he do with the pento?
Have you got it?

272
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:20,484
How can you be sure he didn't?

273
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,694
'Cause he ended it, Bibi, okay?
That's how.

274
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:26,865
He wouldn't do that for me.
I don't know what I was thinking.

275
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:30,994
I've ruined it all.

276
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:33,956
Oh, Urs.

277
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:38,043
Okay, if anyone in this room did it,
we need to say.

278
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,337
I mean it.

279
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:43,382
No one is gonna have
to deal with this alone.

280
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:46,093
We'll close ranks, circle in.

281
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,720
It's the only way we can all be protected.

282
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:52,975
Urs.

283
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:56,687
She was on her own all night.

284
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:58,991
- Who's to say she didn't?
- 'Cause I didn't.

285
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:00,858
- Because she didn't.
- Okay.

286
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:02,651
So, both of you get
automatically believed,

287
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:06,238
- and I have to provide a bloody alibi?
- She didn't have someone else involved.

288
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,073
She's a fucking psycho!

289
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:12,035
I'm not the one who tried to kill someone
so my husband didn't discover my affair.

290
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,329
- You f... Bitch.
- Look, just stop! Okay? Just stop.

291
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:17,416
- You're the psycho!
- Where were you, Becka?

292
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:20,544
I need to know where you were that night.
Why was there mud on your shoes?

293
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:23,839
I got hammered at the pub!
Miss fucking Marple.

294
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:26,008
I was worried
you would do something reckless,

295
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:29,303
- so I got pissed. You taught me well.
- Don't talk to her like that!

296
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,054
What are you fighting about?

297
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:35,559
Nothing. Just politics.

298
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,728
Ever since John Paul died,

299
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:40,063
whenever I walk into the room,
you stop talking.

300
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:41,857
No, we don't!

301
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,525
What's happened, Grace? You okay?

302
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:45,903
They did a postmortem on John Paul.

303
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:49,364
My signature is on this
like I agreed to it.

304
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,035
- Those dirty bastards.
- Shut up.

305
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:55,329
Oh, my God.

306
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:01,627
You knew about it.
You knew about the postmortem.

307
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:06,507
Why did they exhume John Paul's body?

308
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:15,599
Because they think he was murdered.

309
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,531
And they think
it was one of us who did it.

310
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,024
One of you?

311
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:27,361
Why would they think that?

312
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:32,824
Because they think
we all had reason to kill him.

313
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:36,161
- And because...
- No! Just...

314
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:37,579
Stop lying to her!

315
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,042
Because we may not have killed him…

316
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:46,004
Jesus, we tried.

317
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:49,466
What are you talking about?
What does that mean? "We tried"?

318
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,262
We wanted John Paul dead, Gracie.

319
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:57,558
We were doing it for you.

320
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:00,227
We wanted to save you.

321
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:04,982
We wanted you and Blanaid to be free.

322
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:11,738
Gracie.

323
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:24,710
I'm so sorry.

324
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:29,965
I'm so, so sorry.

325
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:37,556
- There you go.
- It was my birthday.

326
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:39,933
We were having a lovely evening…

327
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,397
Come on, you.

328
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:54,114
These stairs are slippery, Mammy.

329
00:26:54,198 --> 00:26:55,490
Very slippery.

330
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:58,619
We need to do something
about these stairs.

331
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:02,206
- What are you looking for, honey?
- Jam-jams.

332
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,751
You could go without them, maybe?

333
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:08,545
Just for tonight.

334
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:12,216
That tickles, Mam.

335
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:14,885
Well, then…

336
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,304
I'll just have to be more careful,
won't I?

337
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:41,787
Tell me it's just you and me.

338
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:45,832
Yeah.

339
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:07,039
Hey.

340
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:11,126
Are you trying to break my neck?
Don't do that.

341
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,295
- John Paul.
- No, I'm...

342
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:15,923
I'm not doing this now.

343
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,970
Here we go, the dramatic tear fall.

344
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:27,726
I just wanted to kiss you, baby.
I just want...

345
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,646
No, you don't just want to kiss, Grace.

346
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:33,857
You always want something more.
The pressure you put on me is…

347
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:39,446
Ursula says it's so normal. Y...

348
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,910
There are loads of reasons for impotence,
like...

349
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:47,871
Have you talked to your sisters
about my cock?

350
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,749
Ursula's a nurse.

351
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:52,977
- She's used to talking about...
- She's a whore!

352
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,002
I beg your pardon?

353
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:59,550
Your sisters are poison, Grace.
And they poison your mind.

354
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:02,052
Why do you keep talking about my sisters?

355
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:07,432
- I'm just trying to help fix a problem.
- Who are you to fix anything anyway?

356
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:08,809
I mean, you're nothing.

357
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:12,187
You're a fly on a wall. You're a shadow.

358
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:16,191
If I turn out that light right now,
you wouldn't even exist.

359
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:17,651
You wanna try it?

360
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:21,780
You wanna try that? See what happens?

361
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:23,282
Here we go.

362
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:28,453
Hello? Mammy? Where's Mammy?
Has anyone seen Mammy?

363
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:31,331
See? You're not even a shadow anymore.

364
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:35,794
There you are.

365
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:38,088
You're back. Mammy's back.

366
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,048
You exist again.

367
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,388
Where are you going? I dare you to say it.

368
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:49,141
I'm going to my sisters.

369
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:53,896
You just won't see it, will you?
Your sisters are the problem!

370
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:55,790
They're the only ones
who actually care about me.

371
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:58,275
Well, they will do anything
to pull us apart.

372
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,527
That's how much they care about you.

373
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:02,005
- Do you wanna talk about this?
- No!

374
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:04,573
Do you want to know why
I have issues getting it up with you?

375
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:10,287
Because one of
your precious sisters seduced me,

376
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,372
that's why.

377
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:13,665
What are you talking about?

378
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,752
Seduced you? What does that even mean?

379
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:20,297
When I was drunk.

380
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,924
Which sister, John Paul? Who?

381
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Eva.

382
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:26,553
Eva?

383
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:27,638
Yes.

384
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:31,600
No, she wouldn't. I don't...

385
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:36,480
You had sex with Eva?

386
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:39,358
Grace, that was not sex.

387
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:42,319
That was a trap.

388
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,071
When?

389
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,573
Years ago. Ten years ago.

390
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:50,702
That Ciaran fellow, he'd passed out,
you'd fallen asleep,

391
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:53,956
and she came onto me.

392
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:58,252
And I was out of my mind drunk,
and I think I thought it was you,

393
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:00,003
and then she tricked me, and it...

394
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:05,384
It's messed me up.
It's messed me up ever since.

395
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:11,139
So it was when
we came up here for my birthday?

396
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,518
And she's even tried to blame me
for what happened after.

397
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,144
For what?

398
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:19,356
- The miscarriage?
- Yes.

399
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:23,735
But I was with her when that happened.
She was destroyed.

400
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:26,530
Yeah, well, whatever happened,
it was her fault.

401
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:31,743
She was filthy drunk, Grace.
That's how you lose a baby.

402
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:36,790
What did you do?

403
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:37,875
What?

404
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,169
What did you make her do?

405
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:41,962
Look at me!

406
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:44,089
Don't you fucking scream at me!

407
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:46,216
Don't!

408
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:50,137
It was her! Your sister!

409
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:51,889
You're a liar.

410
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,565
She's the liar here. She blamed me.

411
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:06,653
She even tried to say that I raped her
'cause she was so disgusted with herself.

412
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:09,406
Did you rape her, John Paul?

413
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:14,661
Did I rape her? No.
You don't rape women like that.

414
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:22,169
- Get off me! You liar!
- Mammy. Ma...

415
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:24,838
Everything you do,
everything we have is a lie!

416
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:30,802
You ruined her life, you fucking monster!

417
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,255
Grace.

418
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:48,797
You blamed me!

419
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:52,467
You made me think it was me!

420
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:01,310
You fucking monster.

421
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:33,800
I didn't do what he said I did.

422
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:35,844
- Course you didn't.
- I didn't do it.

423
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:40,599
I re... I was drunk. I was.

424
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:44,061
And I really thought, you know,
I really thought, "Did I do something?"

425
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:45,145
But…

426
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:47,356
I remember going to the bathroom.

427
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:51,068
And I remember
not being able to lock the door.

428
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:54,029
And I passed out,
or I couldn't get up, or something,

429
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:57,157
and then I looked up, and he was there.

430
00:35:58,408 --> 00:35:59,785
And he was looking down at me.

431
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:02,996
And I remember I smiled at him, but just...

432
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:05,749
Thought he was trying to help me.

433
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,670
But he...

434
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:15,884
- But I didn't do anything. I didn't.
- No.

435
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:18,470
I couldn't stop him

436
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:21,056
because I just... I... because I couldn't.

437
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:22,307
Listen to me.

438
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:25,185
I know that he raped you.

439
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:32,359
I didn't know I was pregnant.

440
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:38,991
I didn't even think I could get so…

441
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,745
But when I miscarried, I tho...
I just thought it was a punishment for it.

442
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:50,544
Don't.

443
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:57,509
I'm sorry.

444
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:42,114
Whatever you're blaming yourself for,
it's not your fault.

445
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:44,825
Either of you.

446
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:53,834
How did you…

447
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:59,339
How did you know what to do with his body?

448
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,572
You buried him in the murder weapon.

449
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:49,992
- How do you mean?
- His pajamas.

450
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:52,035
Sorry.

451
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:55,414
How did you keep it to yourself
for so long, Gracie?

452
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:06,008
Why did you never tell me what happened?

453
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:10,929
I was going to. I was. I was
going to tell you the next morning, just…

454
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:14,391
the moment I didn't, I knew I never would.

455
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:19,521
It's Matt.

456
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:22,232
Answer it.

457
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:26,820
Hello?

458
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:28,655
I need to see you.

459
00:41:30,324 --> 00:41:31,325
That's nice.

460
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:34,828
I'm a bit busy now.

461
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:37,831
I've been to the cabin in Wicklow.
I know what happened to JP.

462
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,542
- Becka?
- Wait…

463
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:54,264
Well?

464
00:41:58,143 --> 00:41:59,353
What did he say?

465
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:02,314
He was at the cabin.
He wants to meet up with me.

466
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:05,067
So what does he know?

467
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:08,237
I guess that's what I'll find out.

468
00:42:11,823 --> 00:42:14,409
I can't go to prison. I can't do that.
I can't...

469
00:42:14,493 --> 00:42:16,870
I can't leave Blanaid on her own.
I can't do that.

470
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:18,954
For God's sake,
surely we just explain what he did.

471
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:20,916
The rape, the abuse.

472
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:22,602
I mean, he's pushed us all over the edge.

473
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:24,771
Yeah, let's try that,
'cause that always works for women.

474
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:27,130
- I...
- Where you going?

475
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:29,299
I have to take Blanaid to her swimming.

476
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:32,344
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

477
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:34,221
What?
You think if we sit here long enough,

478
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:37,349
we're just gonna figure it out
like a bloody crossword puzzle?

479
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:42,312
I have to be a mother to my daughter
for as long as I can be.

480
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:44,231
Okay. You can go.

481
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:46,775
- It's okay.
- You can go.

482
00:42:48,777 --> 00:42:50,946
- Love you, Gracie.
- I love you too.

483
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:52,030
I love you.

484
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:54,199
We're here, okay?

485
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:05,794
I have to go meet Matt, so…

486
00:43:05,878 --> 00:43:07,588
Yeah. I'm gonna come with you.

487
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:09,464
Can you just let me do this?

488
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:14,469
Okay.

489
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,103
She took your jacket.

490
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:25,022
I know.

491
00:43:39,995 --> 00:43:41,431
- Whatever you're thinking...
- Becka.

492
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:42,456
It was me.

493
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:46,960
I killed him. I did it.

494
00:43:47,044 --> 00:43:48,795
I know why you're saying that.

495
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,883
- And I also know that you're lying.
- I did it, Matt.

496
00:43:56,678 --> 00:43:58,972
Why are you punishing yourself like this?

497
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:01,934
If I mean anything to you…

498
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:06,104
then keep what you found out to yourself.
Please.

499
00:44:06,188 --> 00:44:08,524
You're asking me to choose you
over my brother.

500
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:09,900
He was an abuser.

501
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:13,278
He was a rapist. He raped my sister.

502
00:44:13,362 --> 00:44:17,574
- He ruined our lives.
- And Grace killed him. She murdered him.

503
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:20,244
You and your sisters covered it up.

504
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:28,001
My mouth is so dry. I can't swallow.

505
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:32,214
I need a drink or something.

506
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:40,347
Do you…

507
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:45,185
Do you want a hot-water bottle, or...

508
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:46,270
Why?

509
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:49,982
Well…

510
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:53,694
I just thought with...

511
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:58,740
Yeah, well, it was ten years ago.

512
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:03,078
I mean, hot-water bottles are great,
but that might be a stretch.

513
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:09,918
I can't find my wash-bag.
I thought I left it on the table.

514
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:12,379
It has the pento in it.

515
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:13,672
Did you do something with it?

516
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:16,466
Yeah, Ursula. I put it on my cornflakes.

517
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:18,135
Well, did you take it?

518
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:20,053
No. What?

519
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,474
Oh, my God.

520
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:28,604
Becka, I'm on my way to you now.

521
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:31,023
Please don't do anything stupid.

522
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:31,982
Get in the back.

523
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:33,942
- Come on.
- Drive, Eva!

524
00:45:34,026 --> 00:45:35,319
I am!

525
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:38,280
- Drive!
- Just hand her the bloody seat belt.

526
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:56,757
Shit.

527
00:45:58,175 --> 00:45:59,218
Shit.

528
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:27,496
I love you.

529
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:33,669
You shouldn't say
something that you don't mean.

530
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:35,045
But I do.

531
00:46:37,548 --> 00:46:39,007
I love you. That's the truth.

532
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:45,806
I'm sorry, Becka.

533
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:20,048
Just go. Please.

534
00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:42,654
Oh, my God, I'm stuck!

535
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:46,408
- Wait!
- No, don't wait!

536
00:47:46,491 --> 00:47:47,492
Come on!

537
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:49,369
- Press the button!
- I'm pressing it!

538
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:56,793
Becka. What are you doing?

539
00:47:57,753 --> 00:48:00,839
What the fuck?
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

540
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:04,384
I couldn't do it.
I'm sorry I couldn't do it.

541
00:48:04,468 --> 00:48:08,472
- I couldn't do it.
- Stop. It's okay.

542
00:48:09,056 --> 00:48:10,307
I killed her.

543
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:12,643
Listen. Listen to me.

544
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:15,229
Whatever happens next,
you have to forgive yourself, Becka.

545
00:48:15,312 --> 00:48:17,689
You have to. You have to forgive yourself.

546
00:48:18,774 --> 00:48:20,442
It's okay. She's okay.

547
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:22,027
Yeah, well, she won't be in a minute.

548
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,987
You almost gave us a heart attack!

549
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:26,782
Where is he? Becka, where has he gone?

550
00:48:29,785 --> 00:48:31,995
He knows Grace killed him
and thinks we covered it up.

551
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:34,831
Well…

552
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:38,085
Well, maybe there's a way around this.

553
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,087
Diminished responsibility, or...

554
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:42,631
Whatever happens to Grace,
we covered up a murder…

555
00:48:44,675 --> 00:48:47,302
I think that's frowned on
in certain circles.

556
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:50,430
Yeah, you know what else is frowned on
in certain circles?

557
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:54,434
Faking signatures.
Illegally exhuming bodies.

558
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:57,729
All we tried to do
was kill that fucker a few times.

559
00:48:57,813 --> 00:48:58,814
Bibi…

560
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:06,280
So, what are you gonna do?

561
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:47,779
Fuck!

562
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:38,223
I've a daughter. I'm a father, Matt.
I'm a daddy.

563
00:51:42,978 --> 00:51:44,062
How are the girls?

564
00:51:44,646 --> 00:51:46,406
Yeah,
the little one's out of intensive care,

565
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:50,027
and Theresa asked me to go to AbraKebabra
to get an all-meat kebab,

566
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,695
so that's a good sign. I think.

567
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:53,322
Could be ominous.

568
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:55,991
We don't have to pay out
the Williams claim, Tom.

569
00:51:57,117 --> 00:51:58,911
What? What do you mean?

570
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:04,291
Grace Williams. She's withdrawn the claim.

571
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,938
- Well, how the hell did you do that, Matt?
- It doesn't matter.

572
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:10,682
It does matter!
Well, of course, it matters!

573
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:12,633
You had your secrets, okay?

574
00:52:12,716 --> 00:52:15,093
Didn't seem to bother you
that I was in the dark.

575
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:19,598
In fact, I'm pretty sure you said
it was for my own good. Well, so is this.

576
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:26,522
You clever little bastard.

577
00:52:40,953 --> 00:52:42,955
Blanaid, you look beautiful.

578
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:45,791
Maybe put on a coat, though?

579
00:52:45,874 --> 00:52:47,000
See you later, Mam.

580
00:52:48,544 --> 00:52:49,878
Text me.

581
00:52:49,962 --> 00:52:51,129
Mam, I'll see you later.

582
00:52:53,757 --> 00:52:54,925
Bla, I love you.

583
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:05,352
I love you too, Mam.

584
00:53:07,688 --> 00:53:08,689
Have fun.

585
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:12,067
- Bla, hurry up!
- Coming!

586
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:25,747
Blink of an eye and she's all grown up.

587
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:30,711
Well, a lot has happened.
That's sure to change you.

588
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:34,798
I see you're moving on.

589
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:38,218
We have no choice.
Can't afford to stay here.

590
00:53:38,802 --> 00:53:42,222
We're gonna live with Eva. A widow
and a spinster, living it up.

591
00:53:45,684 --> 00:53:46,977
Before we leave, I wanted to...

592
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,938
Please. Grace, don't.

593
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:52,983
I never did thank you for what you did.

594
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:55,068
You can't thank me for that.

595
00:53:55,152 --> 00:53:57,321
If I had opened my eyes
to what was going on,

596
00:53:57,404 --> 00:53:59,406
if I'd just seen what he was doing to you,

597
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,742
it would never have come to that.

598
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:05,370
I wish I hadn't asked you for your help…

599
00:54:09,082 --> 00:54:10,209
but what you did,

600
00:54:11,877 --> 00:54:13,170
that was a good thing.

601
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:27,726
Don't forget about me.

602
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:29,728
I won't.

603
00:55:08,433 --> 00:55:09,852
Bring your own then!

604
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:23,490
Are you trying to will
that dick in the Speedo's to fall in?

605
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:26,994
No. I will now, though.

606
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:30,080
You all right?

607
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:34,459
Hola, chicas!

608
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:36,003
- Hola!
- Hello.

609
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:37,087
Finally.

610
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:39,548
- Where have you been?
- Sorry, I had a business meeting.

611
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:40,841
- Dirt bird.
- Shut up.

612
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:42,926
All right, you mad cow.

613
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,636
All right, you mad bitch.

614
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,181
Man, I missed that laugh.

615
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:49,600
I didn't realize how much.

616
00:55:51,852 --> 00:55:54,313
You're only as happy
as your unhappiest child.

617
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:57,149
And she's grand now.

618
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:02,905
- Oi! Are we getting in or what?
- Go on then.

619
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:05,908
Yes! Come on. Took her time.

620
00:56:08,327 --> 00:56:10,579
God. A voluntary hug.

621
00:56:16,502 --> 00:56:17,669
Thank you, Gracie.

622
00:56:19,588 --> 00:56:22,883
Look at you. Bloody wet suit.

623
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:25,010
- Bitch.
- I came prepared!

624
00:56:46,448 --> 00:56:49,117
- Come on, Grace!
- Get in! Come on!

625
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:51,411
- Come on!
- Get in!

626
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:53,747
- Oi!
- Come on!

627
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,083
Come on, Grace! Do it!

628
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:57,501
What are you waiting for?

629
00:56:57,584 --> 00:56:59,253
- Get in!
- Come on, Grace.
