1
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,775
Mammy?

2
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,319
Mammy.

3
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,488
Sorry.

4
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,366
I must have fallen asleep there.

5
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:34,743
- Was it the fire again?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,371
I know. I know.

7
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,249
You could have lost me.

8
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,875
But you didn't.

9
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,211
- I didn't.
- No.

10
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:49,758
- God must have bigger plans for you.
- I'd like to think so.

11
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,426
- Stick the kettle on.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,434
I'm so relieved we didn't put
the new kitchen units in there.

13
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:00,519
Yes.

14
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:06,900
Put them on the insurance, anyway.
I could have died.

15
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,193
- I...
- Shush now.

16
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,372
The girls are at the Forty Foot.

17
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,416
I don't know how they find the time.

18
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,961
- Ursula has three kids.
- They're a different kind of woman to you.

19
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,256
They choose not
to put their families first.

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,883
That's true.

21
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,593
And you should be proud of it.

22
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,637
"The greatest achievement
is selflessness."

23
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,390
Well, that's very beautiful.
Where did you hear that?

24
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,393
Moonpig. Moonpig.com.

25
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:52,404
And I'm sure you'll find that
Ursula manages to make time for herself.

26
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,801
She's very quiet this morning.

27
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,054
Yeah, well, I'm not.
We need to... We need to talk.

28
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,931
Yeah, I know. Not now.

29
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,432
- Hey.
- Hi.

30
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,869
I didn't know you were coming.
You didn't respond to my text.

31
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,604
I didn't realize I had to RSVP
to freeze my bollocks off.

32
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,731
Got it. Auntie Becka, I got something!

33
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,107
We think it's a crab.

34
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,485
Yeah. Just give me two minutes.
I'll come in with ya.

35
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,323
What were you two talking about?

36
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,491
What were you asking Eva?

37
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,909
What was I...

38
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,287
Are you going to Grace's egg hunt
thing on Saturday?

39
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,747
Yeah. No.

40
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,000
I... I can't because I'm prepping
for Sunday lunch.

41
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,711
Yeah, I can't either.
Gonna visit her mother-in-law.

42
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,129
Want to butter up John Paul.

43
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,548
That's a horrible visual.

44
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,551
I'm thinking of asking
for a loan for the studio.

45
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,718
Why would you do that?

46
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,220
'Cause you can't help me out.

47
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,473
Yeah, I can't help you out now.
Just give me a couple of months.

48
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,225
It'll be gone in a couple of months.

49
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,787
I'm gonna give his mother
some physio on her hip.

50
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,897
Show her I'm an investment.
Like a share in a racehorse, you know?

51
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,525
- Or a pigeon.
- He's never gonna give you the money.

52
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,611
Well, I'll ask Grace then. It's half hers.

53
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,491
- What?
- You're just being naive.

54
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,451
- She's being stupid.
- Shut your hole.

55
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,538
Hey, Grace doesn't have her own
bank account. She shops with a Monzo.

56
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,665
Mom, can we go in the water now?

57
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,458
Wait for your Auntie Becka.

58
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,710
You trying to get rid of me?

59
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,461
You just said you'd go in with them.

60
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,260
You kids find any crab?

61
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,184
Hey. You all right?

62
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,646
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Just, late.

63
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,481
Could you bring David home to Donal?

64
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,359
He'll be there all day.
Thanks a million. See you later.

65
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,737
Thanks for asking. Let me...

66
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,381
Let me think,
does that work with my plans?

67
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,490
No problem. Leave it with me.

68
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,161
Such a piss-take.
What is wrong with this family?

69
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,432
So, when are we going
to have another go at killing the prick?

70
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,124
Bibi.

71
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,269
Not giving up just
'cause of one little setback, Eva.

72
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:14,046
A setback? We blew up their home.

73
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,756
Yeah, but not him.

74
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,312
There's all kinds of ways
people can die by accident.

75
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,980
All kinds of unfortunate mishaps.

76
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,399
I was thinking something at work,
an industrial accident.

77
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,568
We work in an
open-plan architectural firm.

78
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,004
- What are we gonna do?
- Auntie Eva?

79
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,714
- Paper cut him to death?
- We've got crabs.

80
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,657
The roof terrace? The fire escape?

81
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,450
Yeah, we're not doing anything like that.

82
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,854
We're doing it again,
we're doing it with poison this time.

83
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,454
Like normal women.

84
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,493
Matt, you listening?

85
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,204
We use what we found out at the hotel

86
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,247
to increase the pressure
with this next sister.

87
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,582
See what we glean.

88
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,543
Got a contact
for a detective inspector in Malahide.

89
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,295
Dad used to send him a hamper every year.

90
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,379
No idea why.

91
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,924
Probably some bet
that started years ago at the dogs.

92
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,276
Probably just shagging his wife.

93
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,236
So, we go after his permission
for the postmortem.

94
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,803
That's... That's not gonna happen.

95
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,598
Really? Well, let's see,

96
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,808
because I can be
a persuasive motherfucker.

97
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,561
What?

98
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,730
So...
Sorry, you're just ridiculous.

99
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,822
- What are you doing? Answer it.
- No, I'm not answering it with you here.

100
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,866
Jesus. F... I'm ridiculous?

101
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,291
Hello. Matthew speak...

102
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,545
Matt, nice to hear from ya.

103
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,754
Huh?

104
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,966
I'm just about to head out.
What can I do for you?

105
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,468
I think you called me. What's up?

106
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,971
No, no, no. That's cold.

107
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:13,892
How about you called me to say that...

108
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,019
You called m... You called me.

109
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:19,189
That it was gorgeous
to see me the other night.

110
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,608
It was nice to see you.

111
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,697
I... I really liked...
I really liked talking to you.

112
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,740
I just, I've been... I've been thinking...

113
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,702
And you wanted to get that date
nailed down so you can see me again?

114
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,706
Yeah, all right. What are you doing later?

115
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,333
Free as a mud lark.

116
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,752
Text me what time and where.

117
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,755
Don't wear that tiny jacket.
Thanks for calling.

118
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,688
It's great you answered
the phone like a big boy,

119
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:03,317
but do you want to wipe this stupid smile
off your face before she opens the door?

120
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,628
I'm your twelve o'clock.

121
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,173
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Course.

122
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,845
It's groin strain.

123
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:32,929
Great.

124
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,808
- Who is it, Michael?
- Two boys.

125
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,024
Come on in. Sit down.

126
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,445
All right.

127
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,579
Michael, love,
go on upstairs and get ready, okay?

128
00:08:58,622 --> 00:08:59,623
Go on.

129
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,902
Can I get you something to drink?

130
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,795
- Just some water, ple...
- Coffee would be great.

131
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,880
Didn't sleep well last night.

132
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,884
Yeah, lucky you caught me. I was about to
take Michael to his appointment.

133
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,093
Shouldn't take too long.

134
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,637
Just a few questions about
your brother-in-law's accident

135
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,763
for the insurance.

136
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:16,974
Right. Yeah.

137
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,601
…the weather.
Yesterday was absolutely…

138
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,083
Tom.

139
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,421
Tom. Get back. Tom.

140
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,384
- Jesus Christ.
- Sorry.

141
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,220
Sorry, I was just stretching me leg.
I have a cramp.

142
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:57,347
That is usually a buildup of lactic acid.
Cramp.

143
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,892
Right, yeah. I forgot you're a nurse.

144
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,437
Must come in handy,
all that medical knowledge.

145
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:09,693
Yeah, well, you... you know,
handy for scrapes and child ailments.

146
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,988
We're all out of coffee, sorry.

147
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,201
It's a terrible business, you know.

148
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,874
So you were with your husband
the night of John Paul's death?

149
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,837
No, no. I was with my sisters.

150
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,631
Yeah, right. Sorry.

151
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:33,675
Your other sister said.
I-I didn't realize it was all of yous.

152
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,927
Yeah.

153
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,387
- So you go everywhere together?
- Well, we're close.

154
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,556
Like a pack?

155
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,391
Like a family.

156
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,144
So you had dinner together or...

157
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,312
Yeah.

158
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,814
Nice. What did you eat?

159
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,108
Sorry?

160
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:51,527
You'd food and drinks you said.

161
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,197
I can't remember
what we ate exactly.

162
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,828
Probably something simple. Like…

163
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,831
- chicken?
- Chicken.

164
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,501
In a chimichurri sauce.

165
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,545
That's what we'd usually have.

166
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:13,590
And probably a salad and garlic rice...

167
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,384
Is that one M? Chimichurri?

168
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,263
I don't know.

169
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,266
What was your relationship with
your brother-in-law like, Mrs. Garvey?

170
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,434
Flynn. Mrs. Flynn.

171
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,771
What do we... It was... It was good. Yeah.

172
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:31,066
We all got on like one big,
happy family, as they say.

173
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,278
That's not what your sister said.

174
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:36,488
- Grace?
- Eva.

175
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,448
Eva.

176
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,492
Well, her and JP are work colleagues,

177
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,578
so it was probably
a different story for them.

178
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,080
And Eva's a bit of a hothead, unlike me.

179
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,374
What are you like?

180
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,127
What am I like?

181
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:56,967
I'm... I'm a mother and a wife.

182
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,386
I'm a nurse.

183
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,848
Don't know what else to say.

184
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,225
I lead a pretty boring life, to be honest.

185
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:23,911
I miss you.

186
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,412
I'm not gone yet.

187
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,414
Miss you in five minutes then.

188
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:38,300
Oh, before I forget.

189
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,551
Free hotel swag.

190
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,182
- You can think of me in the shower.
- I don't think about much else.

191
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,518
I have to go.

192
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,561
I should bring Michael
to a doctor's appointment,

193
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:50,979
and then I start my night shift.

194
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:52,983
I should have been sleeping today,
not, you know?

195
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:57,486
I'm sorry I didn't let you sleep.
There was just too much to do.

196
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,788
Did I tell you
I have deep feelings for you?

197
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,725
Up into Ulster this afternoon,

198
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,937
reaching parts of Munster
and north Leinster later this evening.

199
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,691
Largely dry elsewhere
with sunny spells developing.

200
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:37,568
Highest temperatures…

201
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:38,986
Shit.

202
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,947
No, not here.

203
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,704
John Paul.

204
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,251
Oh, that's quite the ding.

205
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,755
I'm going to have to take your details,
sister-in-law.

206
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,215
Of course. Yeah.

207
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:03,969
- Sorry, I don't know how that...
- 181-D-588.

208
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,306
Location?
What's the name of this hotel? Or…

209
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,266
Is it a brothel?

210
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,020
Did you follow me here?

211
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,980
Is this how you like
to spend your time off?

212
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,524
Not with your kids?
Not with your disabled son?

213
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,985
Do not talk about my son.

214
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,987
Does Donal know about your little affair?

215
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,909
- John Paul, if...
- Finish it.

216
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,912
Or I'll tell him.

217
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,331
You're vile.

218
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,542
Do you know that?

219
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,545
Disgraceful. That's what you are.

220
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:40,631
And disgusting.

221
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:44,718
Disgraceful, vile and disgusting.
That's what you are.

222
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:52,017
Vile, disgusting, and disgraceful.
That's you, Ursula Garvey.

223
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,853
Vile, disgusting, and disgraceful.

224
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,569
Got you by the short and curlies,
Ursula Garvey.

225
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,948
Hello, Gerald.

226
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,449
Oh, where the hell are you?

227
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,173
I was just heading back
to the office now.

228
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:12,412
- They kept waiting to...
- I don't wanna hear it.

229
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:15,225
- Sorry, it definitely won't happen again.
- Get back to the office now.

230
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,376
- I'm... I'm terribly sorry.
- Bloody liberty.

231
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,378
Fuck.

232
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,297
Hi.

233
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:24,842
We put it in his liver.

234
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:28,136
- What?
- Monday is liver day.

235
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,348
Only JP eats it, but he makes her
cook it every bloody week.

236
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,671
Grace always gets something else
for herself and Blanaid.

237
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,144
Well, how do we get it in there?

238
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:37,628
I think we bring Ursula in on this.

239
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,040
If anyone's gonna know how to do it,

240
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,607
- it's a nurse.
- What? No, no way.

241
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:41,775
Why not?

242
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,694
Because she'd never...

243
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,612
- She's a mother.
- So am I.

244
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:49,283
Yeah, but you're... Well, she...
She's got morals. She's...

245
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,427
Bibi, I'm not getting into this
on the phone at work.

246
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,370
- Can I come round?
- No.

247
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,538
What?

248
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,040
Oh, God. Fine. Come round tomorrow night.

249
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,834
I'll try and bunk off a bit earlier.

250
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,503
Come on, everybody.
It's the Thursday raffle.

251
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,131
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, thank you.

252
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,300
Sorry.

253
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,426
Eva?

254
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:08,869
Sorry. You just... You startled me.

255
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,721
I'm very startling.

256
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,515
- Did you buy a ticket?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

257
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,393
I mean, I... I buy all the tickets
to all the charities.

258
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,978
I just... Catholic guilt, you know?

259
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:21,440
War Child, Help the Aged. Donkey Sanctuary
got a big payout last week.

260
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:24,003
- Oh, you have a big heart.
- Yeah, I care a lot about donkeys.

261
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:28,906
What are you up to for the weekend?

262
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:36,663
Oh, I'm just sitting on my sofa watching,
true crime documentaries.

263
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,081
Nazis, probably.

264
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,376
- You?
- Same.

265
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,837
Yeah, I don't believe
that for a second.

266
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:45,464
Oh, come on.

267
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,508
Oh, it's green, 2-1-6.

268
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,176
Green ticket, 2-1-6.

269
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,511
- Shit.
- You got it?

270
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:51,595
It's me.

271
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,555
- Yeah, we have a winner.
- No.

272
00:16:56,934 --> 00:17:00,229
Something for the weekend.
Not that you'll need it, I'm sure.

273
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,105
- Thank you so much.
- Enjoy.

274
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:03,857
How did they know?

275
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:06,151
If a man did that, can you imagine?

276
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:10,781
Listen, we should go for a drink sometime.

277
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:12,782
When you're not watching Nazis.

278
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,284
Huh?

279
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,746
- A drink? Liquid alcohol? Glass container?
- Sorry? Yes, yeah.

280
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,580
Yeah, that would be... I'd like that.

281
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:22,125
- That'd be... Yeah, give me a call, okay.
- Okay.

282
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:24,670
What the fuck, Eva?

283
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,172
Oh, shit! Sorry! Sorry.

284
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,258
Sorry. God, I think I just got asked out.

285
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:31,134
Oh, and I won a dildo.

286
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,473
Minna. It's Becka.

287
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,184
Hello? Minna?

288
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,896
Oh, come in. Come in.

289
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,065
I left my G-string on.

290
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,071
It's on backwards, but great stuff.

291
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,621
I'm seeing this lad called Callum.

292
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,250
I don't want to shock you,
but I'm just in it for the sex.

293
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,752
That's how George and I began.

294
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:10,424
He only wanted one thing,
but then he saw what else I had.

295
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,888
You're gas.
Are you sure you're John Paul's ma?

296
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:19,600
Nah. I think they dipped him in vinegar
before they handed him over.

297
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:25,397
Sorry. All done now, anyway.

298
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:36,950
George collected all this.
George is my hubby.

299
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,535
He should be home soon.

300
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:46,376
So how did George manage
to land a beautiful girl like you?

301
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,878
He threw a dead bird at me.

302
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,507
Oh, really? That's interesting.

303
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,841
It got my attention.

304
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:55,552
Strange.

305
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,430
Love makes you do strange things.

306
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,309
Why stick a finger up someone's asshole?

307
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:05,604
Well, he didn't deserve you.

308
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,106
They're all bastards, right?

309
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,026
No, dear. They are not.

310
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:16,615
But he just walked out on you.
I mean he just left you.

311
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:20,536
No, that is not the story.
He will be back very soon.

312
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,332
Hey.

313
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,794
Oh, look, Blanaid has a bouncy castle.

314
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:31,380
You didn't bring the basket, Ursula.
Ursula?

315
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,465
- Enjoy kids.
- Bye, Dad!

316
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:34,925
I'll bring you a bucket of eggs.

317
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:38,095
- You're not coming in?
- No.

318
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,430
I'll leave the Easter Bunny
to you and the girls, JP.

319
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:43,433
Got to keep the wife happy.
God knows what could happen otherwise.

320
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,936
Oh, I hear you.
Very hard to keep this one happy, though.

321
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,437
Bet she's worth it.

322
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,068
- See you later.
- Later.

323
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,405
See you.

324
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,827
Is it finished with your fuck buddy?

325
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,788
Urs. Come on.

326
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,373
- Yeah, coming.
- End it.

327
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,667
Or I'll tell Donal. I swear, I mean it.

328
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,961
It's over, okay?

329
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,881
It's finished.

330
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:18,468
Well, in that case, in you go.

331
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,183
Hello, you.

332
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:26,268
Come to daddy, Oscar.

333
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:27,895
Hello.

334
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,401
Anything else I can help you with?

335
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,986
Yeah, actually.

336
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,198
Your brother-in-law claimed
for a car accident

337
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:41,158
at the Marker Hotel about four months ago.

338
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:45,287
If I'm not mistaken,
you were involved in that accident too.

339
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,998
Yes. Yes, I was.

340
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,627
It was just a little ding-a-ling, really.

341
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,462
What were you both doing at the hotel?

342
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:54,796
Well…

343
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,177
I was having lunch
with an old friend and...

344
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,889
Well, I don't know what...
I don't know what JP was doing.

345
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,474
And who was the old friend?

346
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:09,853
It's probably none of your business.

347
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:11,271
I know. Sorry.

348
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:14,566
I didn't see your name
in the reservations book, is all.

349
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,652
That's because I didn't make
a reservation.

350
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:19,613
I just walked in.

351
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,658
Always more fun not to plan.

352
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:24,284
I'm the same.

353
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,995
Although, it can often lead
to disappointment.

354
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:30,457
I have a lot to be getting on with today,
so if there's anything else you need...

355
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,335
Yes. May I use
the little boy's room quickly?

356
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,713
Top of the stairs,
second door on the left.

357
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,301
Potluck whether it's been flushed or not.

358
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,022
Hello.

359
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:56,233
- Hey.
- No problem.

360
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,319
What? Why are you talking funny?

361
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:01,029
- Okay.
- The insurance twats?

362
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:03,553
- Yeah, it's all... It's all great.
- I told you you'd be next.

363
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:06,243
- Oh, shit. Are they still there?
- It's all great.

364
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,204
- Don't... Don't panic because... Yeah.
- I'll... I'll call you later.

365
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:11,373
Hello. Oh, shit.

366
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:18,922
Did you hear that?

367
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:21,550
- Sorry?
- Nothing.

368
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:54,791
There he is now.

369
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,044
- We'll be out of your hair.
- Good stuff.

370
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,128
Yeah.

371
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:02,174
You know what?

372
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:06,637
I've been debating whether to ask this,
but I'm worried if I don't,

373
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,390
I'll just be all…
irked at myself later.

374
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:14,186
Were you having an affair?

375
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,021
With your brother-in-law?

376
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:17,898
What?

377
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,026
Why would you ask something like that?

378
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:23,487
Just, you know... Just a hunch.

379
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,324
Being at a hotel together during the day,
and I know you said...

380
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:31,995
I was not having an affair with John Paul.
No chance on this earth.

381
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,582
The very suggestion of anything intimate
with that man is just...

382
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:36,917
Christ!

383
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,169
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

384
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:40,254
Hey.

385
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:43,465
These gentlemen are, just...

386
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:48,136
They're handling John Paul...
Grace's insurance policy.

387
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:50,138
Right. Good to meet you.

388
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,235
We'll leave you to it.

389
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:16,915
She did not like her brother-in-law.

390
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,625
You're not joking.

391
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:21,545
Well, two more sisters to go.

392
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:25,549
Just keep shaking the trees,
see what other shit apples fall out.

393
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:32,764
Dickhead. Who does that?

394
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:42,357
- What? Who does that?
- It's fine.

395
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,569
Where you going now? Fancy a pint?

396
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,738
I've got my own plans, thank you.

397
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,865
But you can have fun
with your rubbish bag.

398
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:54,203
I need a lift to my place.

399
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:57,497
Knew it.

400
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:06,006
"Death cap is responsible
for most fatal mushroom poisonings.

401
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:10,219
The extraction of toxins can be done
through liquid fungal cultures."

402
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:12,012
I don't even know what that means.

403
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:15,516
"The principal toxic constituent
is amanitin,

404
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,019
which causes liver and kidney failure
that can be fatal."

405
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:20,687
- Can.
- Will.

406
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:23,357
If we extract enough,

407
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,320
then one of these little
bad boys will kill you.

408
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:28,070
Okay, but how? How do we do that?

409
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:32,824
Are these library books?

410
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,869
You know there'd be a record
of what you borrowed?

411
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,955
No, there won't. I stole them.

412
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,791
You stole books from a library?

413
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,793
Calm your ham, I'm gonna bring them back.

414
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:47,631
Well, clean up this shit.

415
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,471
Urs! Hi?

416
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:56,932
- Sorry. Have you got a moment?
- Hey, what's up?

417
00:25:57,015 --> 00:26:00,060
Yeah. Yeah. Of course, come in.

418
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:04,523
It's, it's more than just a fling.

419
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:06,859
Does Donal know?

420
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,656
- I don't want to hurt him.
- Yeah.

421
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:15,701
I don't want to lose the kids.

422
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:17,411
You're not gonna lose the kids.

423
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:18,495
Just…

424
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:21,140
How long has it been going on?

425
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:22,833
Just over a year.

426
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,127
Why are you telling me now?

427
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:29,131
The prick, Eva.

428
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:32,134
He found out. He followed me.

429
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:35,095
Fuck. What?

430
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:37,222
If I don't end it,
he's gonna tell Donal everything.

431
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:40,100
And I-I tried.
And I tried, I really tried.

432
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:43,103
I hate myself.

433
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:46,273
I just lie, and I cheat.

434
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:48,567
No. Come here, it's fine. Stop.

435
00:26:50,903 --> 00:26:53,614
I feel like I used to, you know?
When I'm... When I'm with him.

436
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:56,116
I feel young.

437
00:26:56,992 --> 00:27:00,204
Part of me that's just been sleepwalking
through life for years is...

438
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:01,288
Is awake again.

439
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:02,998
- Wow.
- Fuck's sake.

440
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,292
- Jesus Christ, Bibi.
- Sorry. Okay.

441
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,045
First of all, I'm gonna vomit.
You're pathetic.

442
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:10,797
And secondly, there's another option.

443
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:12,591
- Shut up.
- Why? We need her help anyway.

444
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,319
- Shut up, Bibi.
- What's she talking about?

445
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:17,137
Second option is we lance
the seeping boil that is the prick.

446
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:19,264
We get rid of him.

447
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:21,892
Get rid of him? What are you on about?

448
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,393
Fucking hell.

449
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:25,312
Hang on.

450
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:27,940
We just want to give nature
a helping hand.

451
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,948
Are you out of your fucking mind?

452
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,866
Yeah. May... I don't know. Maybe.

453
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:41,578
No. No. I'm sorry.
You're not dragging me into this.

454
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:42,996
No fucking way.

455
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:47,960
Am I... Am I culpable now?

456
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:52,631
Because you told me ab...
You can't do this.

457
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:56,635
You're gonna land yourselves,
and me, in jail or worse.

458
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,988
We're gonna poison him, Ursula,
with or without your consent,

459
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,573
and we have no intention
of getting caught.

460
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:03,684
And how exactly are you planning
on doing that?

461
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:06,645
Death cap.

462
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:08,856
Are you insane?

463
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:11,900
What about Blanaid?

464
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:14,987
What... What about Grace?

465
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,198
We're gonna do it on liver day.
Only the prick eats it.

466
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:21,242
That's why we need your help. We just
don't know how to extract the poison.

467
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:25,914
The first signs of death cap poisoning
are vomiting and diarrhea.

468
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:29,209
He'll go to A&E, and they'll do tests,

469
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:32,212
and they'll find amanitin in his blood,
and then they'll call the police.

470
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:34,590
And then, when he dies
between three and five days later,

471
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:36,884
they'll be searching for the idiots
who poisoned him.

472
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:41,471
See? This is why we need your help.
What would you recommend instead?

473
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:44,558
Urs, we...

474
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:47,936
Great. That's great.

475
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,668
All right, that's me off
to my night shift, Urs.

476
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:13,253
Have fun at Eva's tomorrow.

477
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:23,805
Hey.

478
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,288
- Do you want a bottle opener for that?
- No, I brought that. That's a screw cap.

479
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:31,313
Classy.

480
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:32,606
Slut.

481
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:37,569
What? She was being a judgy bitch.

482
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:50,958
Hey! Oh, I'll watch next time.
Okay? Catch.

483
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:53,544
Help.

484
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:58,924
- Hi.
- Hey. Oh, hi. I wasn't expecting to...

485
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:01,134
Lemon meringue pie. It has a biscuit base,

486
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:03,136
and I didn't have time
to make pastries, sorry.

487
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,389
You can't beat this woman's pies.
Pastry or not.

488
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,057
Is it okay? I tried calling.

489
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,309
Yeah, of course.
It's just, you're not usually...

490
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:10,602
It was John Paul's idea.

491
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:13,647
Hey, hon.

492
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:16,692
Okay, she'll be better at this.
We can do this.

493
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:18,902
No Donal today?

494
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,571
He's working.

495
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:24,491
That's a shame.
Poor Donal, always missing out.

496
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:26,201
Yeah.

497
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:27,286
Okay.

498
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:35,169
- Lamb?
- I have lots. Thanks.

499
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:37,087
When's the cabin getting sorted, JP?

500
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:40,424
The insurance company is being thorny,
but they'll pay out.

501
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:44,720
Suspicious bloody terriers.
Mammy's very upset.

502
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:47,181
Well… I had two photo albums in there.

503
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:49,391
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, Grace.

504
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:53,187
Yeah, only holiday snaps
of Blanaid when she was little

505
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,023
and others I can't remember,
but photos I can't replace, you know?

506
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:57,316
And my Rolex

507
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:59,818
and the stereo system
and the wide-screen TV.

508
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:03,530
He's making light of it,
but he was really shocked.

509
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:06,325
We're just counting our blessings
that he wasn't actually in there.

510
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:09,077
Grace, thank God
you and Blanaid weren't there.

511
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:11,580
I mean, Christ,
it doesn't bear thinking about.

512
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,832
Yeah.
Well, we were at the concert, so…

513
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:17,961
Can you pass the green beans
over there?

514
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,297
More sauce?

515
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,716
No.

516
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:28,055
I'll have some. Thank you.

517
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,934
- It's mint.
- You won't like it, pet.

518
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:34,895
What is that?

519
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:36,605
Ursula!

520
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:37,731
Are you doing then?

521
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:38,941
- Come on!
- Why?

522
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:41,235
- No!
- Becka! Becka! Becka!

523
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:43,695
Why do we have to do it?

524
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:45,405
'Cause what would Dad say if we didn't?

525
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:47,407
He would say…

526
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:50,494
"This country"

527
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:56,291
was made a free republic
on Easter Sunday in 1916.

528
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,751
"Do the poem, girleen!"

529
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:00,212
Drunk. Drunk and all.

530
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,300
"We knew enough to know that dre"...
I've forgotten...

531
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:07,761
Forgotten the whole thing. I'm so sorry.

532
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:09,555
- You know this.
- Okay. "We... "

533
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:13,559
We knew their dream; enough
To know they dreamed"...

534
00:32:13,642 --> 00:32:15,769
Don't you laugh... "And are dead."

535
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:17,813
- Go!
- Oh, it's me.

536
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:23,193
"And what if... What if excess of love
Bewildered them till they died?"

537
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:24,611
Urs!

538
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:27,656
- Go on.
- "Write it out in a verse... "

539
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,366
"MacDonagh and MacBride."

540
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:31,201
Yes! She knows it.

541
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:33,787
Come on! Go on.

542
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:35,330
"And…"

543
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:36,874
- And to…
- "Connolly!"

544
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:38,584
- Yay!
- And…

545
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:40,294
Look at her, so happy with ourselves.

546
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,087
And… And…

547
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:43,714
- And…
- "And…"

548
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:44,631
"Pearse."

549
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:45,716
Yes!

550
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:50,387
"Now, and in time to be,
Wherever green is worn... "

551
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,347
- Are changed…
- Changed…

552
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:55,184
- Come on. Changed…
- Are changed…

553
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:59,646
"Utterly: A terrible beauty is born."

554
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,731
Come on!

555
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:12,951
- Mommy?
- Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

556
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:15,579
- Too loud?
- It's like having a train in my head.

557
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:17,915
It's like a train in your head. I'm sorry.

558
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:19,458
Sorry, Michael.

559
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:23,462
Like an IRA meeting.

560
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:26,089
Awful.

561
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:27,841
But we have lovely voices, though, right?

562
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:30,177
- Yeah, but noisy mammies.
- Noisy mammies?

563
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:33,138
Drinky mammies.

564
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:35,307
Not all mammies.

565
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,270
- Is there any more meat, Mammy?
- I'll just go.

566
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:39,061
Okay. So, take those.

567
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:42,147
Don't...
Don't get the foils all over my garden.

568
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:44,274
Do you want some more?

569
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,153
- No. No.
- I'm just giving…

570
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:50,256
Yeah, that's Easter.
I love the way you've always made...

571
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,951
…to get lots of animals.
Like, maybe a caterpillar.

572
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:56,078
Sorry, I just really need to pee.

573
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:57,639
You do want
any of the one you brought?

574
00:33:57,663 --> 00:33:58,664
It will be...

575
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:10,259
- Really?
- Yeah. I recommend it.

576
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:18,225
It was in the 12 euros.

577
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:40,289
Oh, God, that's disgusting.

578
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:04,938
Yep.

579
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:09,776
Yep! Coming.

580
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:15,449
Sorry, I was gonna pee myself.

581
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:18,368
And you haven't even had kids yet.

582
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:23,415
- To family. To…
- To family. To you.

583
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:25,751
To having you here at... on Easter.

584
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:29,379
- It's so lovely seeing you together…
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

585
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:33,759
Yeah. But even the...
With the smaller ones.

586
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:35,636
They're just adorable together.

587
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:44,061
Right.

588
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:46,855
Who wants some Easter flan,
courtesy of me?

589
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:49,024
- No flan.
- Oh, I love your weird flan.

590
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:52,528
Did you just ask if we wanted flan
while pulling your flies up?

591
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:55,906
Have you washed your hands,
you dirty bitch?

592
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:58,033
Of course, I washed my hands!

593
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:02,996
- In the shape of a cross.
- Yeah.

594
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,958
Why must she force feed us flan?

595
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:09,545
I've been sitting on that one forever.

596
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:13,257
All your life.
I'm really glad you did.

597
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,550
Come on.

598
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:24,351
How long will it last? Till…

599
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:26,687
It'll last about six months.

600
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,731
I'm in. I love...
I love how there's never any…

601
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:30,816
Come on, Bibi.

602
00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:25,847
Well, I told you there'd be eggs,
and now there's no baskets.

603
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:27,831
- Molly, get... get your coat, okay?
- What? Why?

604
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:29,184
We're going home. I'm sorry, okay?

605
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:31,001
We have to go. Guys, go get your coats on.

606
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:33,795
You look very shook. Have some flan.

607
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:34,963
Where are you going?

608
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:36,858
- I'm so sorry, guys, but we have to go.
- Urs?

609
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:38,383
Grab your stuff and get in the car.

610
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:40,469
Urs! Urs, wait!

611
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:42,721
- Come on, let's go.
- Urs. Molly. Can you just wait?

612
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:45,742
- Just get in. That's it. Close the door.
- Oh, my god. Can you just... Urs!

613
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:46,966
I can explain about the cabin.

614
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:48,644
- What?
- Sorry. Can we talk?

615
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:50,687
No, it's not that. It's nothing.
It's... Thank you.

616
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:52,523
It's, Donal's come home to us.

617
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:55,460
And you know how he loves Easter,
so I just want to... I want us to be there.

618
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:57,319
- No, I don't.
- Will you close the door?

619
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:01,240
Look, give...
Give me a call when you... Jesus.

620
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:02,574
Take...

621
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:06,662
Drive carefully!

622
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:17,130
Pick up, pick up. Come on, come on.
Pick up. Donal. Come on! Pick up!

623
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:20,425
What's going on, Mom? Mom!

624
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:21,593
Nothing!

625
00:38:21,677 --> 00:38:23,554
I want flan!

626
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:25,013
Pick up. Pick up.

627
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:27,099
Auntie Becka said
she had a special egg for me.

628
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:28,725
- Why did we have to leave?
- Pick up.

629
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,978
And Michael wants flan, Ursula.

630
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:33,141
Yeah, we have to meet your father,
okay? It's urgent.

631
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:35,607
Just, put some headphones
on your brother, Molly, and...

632
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:39,570
Jesus! Jesus Christ, man!

633
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:43,115
Jesus Christ, man.

634
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:45,492
Jesus Christ, man.

635
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:47,661
Jesus Christ, man.

636
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:50,956
- Jesus Chr...
- Jesus Christ, man!

637
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,791
Jesus Christ, man.

638
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:55,752
- Jesus Christ, man.
- Jesus Christ, man!

639
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:58,380
- Jesus Christ, man!
- Jesus Christ, man!

640
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:09,474
Stay here.

641
00:39:09,558 --> 00:39:11,310
Molly, you're in charge.

642
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:13,520
- I don't want to.
- Molly, please!

643
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:15,885
Miss Murphy says you have to say
no when we don't consent,

644
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:17,232
and I do not consent!

645
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:19,026
I don't care about consent!

646
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:21,153
- Follow her in. Follow her in.
- I'm going.

647
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:28,785
Why are you following me?
Go back to the car.

648
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,081
Jesus Christ, man!

649
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:39,046
- Ursula.
- Hi!

650
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:44,760
Excuse me. Pardon me. Thanks.

651
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:46,261
Sorry.

652
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:47,429
Sorry!

653
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:52,100
- No!
- No! Come on, leave them! Come on!

654
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:59,274
- Hey, Ursula.
- Hi! Yeah.

655
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:01,527
- What's Daddy's PIN?
- Mammy, I can't say.

656
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,363
Molly! I will let you get
the top of your ear pierced.

657
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:05,989
Two, four, seven, six, six, six.

658
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:10,160
You shouldn't steal
people's private information, Ursula.

659
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:12,663
Stop calling me Ursula!

660
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:28,804
- Hey. Everything okay?
- Hi.

661
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:30,472
- Yeah...
- Mom said that...

662
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:33,392
That we were,
bringing you this because,

663
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:35,435
we all missed Daddy today, didn't we?

664
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:38,480
And we know that you love…
…Easter, so...

665
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:42,734
I love you.

666
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,571
Oh, brilliant.

667
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:56,331
Metildigoxin.
Inject 300 milligrams into the liver.

668
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:58,292
It will cause fatal cardiac arrhythmia.

669
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:00,127
But I thought you...

670
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,338
No doctor is going to think a heart attack
a man his age is suspicious.

671
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:09,636
And do it quick, before I change my mind.

672
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:13,432
Thank you!

673
00:41:30,324 --> 00:41:32,784
- Come on, pick up.
- Thomas?

674
00:41:32,868 --> 00:41:33,869
Yes?

675
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,454
- Hello?
- Shit!

676
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:36,580
Pardon?

677
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:38,832
Nothing. I'm so sorry.
Just give me one second.

678
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:41,084
- Are you okay?
- I have to pee again!

679
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:43,962
Absolutely. Two... Two ticks.
Give me two ticks.

680
00:41:44,046 --> 00:41:45,464
- Huge apologies.
- Who is this?

681
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:47,174
Listen, you don't know me.

682
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:50,093
I've left a number of messages
with your office. Thomas Claffin.

683
00:41:52,596 --> 00:41:53,972
Postmortem man.

684
00:41:54,056 --> 00:41:58,227
Yeah, world's shittest superhero.
Although, actually, you know...

685
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,354
Thomas, I'm no joke gonna piss the bed.

686
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:01,438
What do you want?

687
00:42:01,522 --> 00:42:04,900
Listen, I'm a friend of
Malcolm Hill. He gave me your number and…

688
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:08,713
I am so sorry to bother you of an evening.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

689
00:42:08,737 --> 00:42:10,739
I'm in the middle of a crime scene…

690
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:13,408
investigation.

691
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:15,160
Thomas!

692
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:18,288
Shit. Look,
normally I'd leave you to your crime scene

693
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:20,412
like a normal human,
but we're really up against it.

694
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:25,420
This postmortem has been requested
by nobody, Mr. Claffin, apart from you.

695
00:42:25,504 --> 00:42:27,923
Not by the law, not by the family,
not by the authorit...

696
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:30,008
No, no, I have the widow's permission.

697
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:32,511
Jesus Christ.

698
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:36,306
What do you say, Inspector?
Can we talk you through our findings?

699
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:39,226
Fine, yeah. Look it.

700
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:41,687
Call the office in the morning.
Arrange an appointment.

701
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,106
Thank you, thank you very much, Inspector.

702
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:45,691
I'm gonna piss the bed!

703
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:46,942
Coming!

704
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:49,611
Sorry, just some shouting at me wife.
She's pregnant.

705
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:53,323
Hello? Hello?

706
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:56,034
Too late!

707
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:05,252
Oi! Pervert!

708
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:12,467
Hi.

709
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:13,552
Hi.

710
00:43:17,723 --> 00:43:18,724
That's nice.

711
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:19,808
Yeah.

712
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:24,479
There you go. Now we're even.

713
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:28,817
No one owes anyone anything,
now that we're even.

714
00:43:33,071 --> 00:43:34,656
Oh, Well, it's this way.

715
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:39,453
Why did I have to wear something sporty?

716
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:42,414
Well, it doesn't matter, really,
'cause you didn't anyway.

717
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:48,337
Shot.

718
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:53,217
Well done, man.

719
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:55,511
High praise, huh?

720
00:43:56,178 --> 00:43:57,971
It is. From Naill anyway.

721
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:02,601
Gonna have a go?

722
00:44:16,907 --> 00:44:18,492
Not really sure you tried there.

723
00:44:19,117 --> 00:44:23,163
Not really sure why you brought me here
on our first date.

724
00:44:24,915 --> 00:44:27,584
It's hard to know what to do
with a girl like yourself.

725
00:44:28,544 --> 00:44:30,629
It is so much easier than you think.

726
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:35,551
Come on, I'm gonna teach you.

727
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:47,104
So, you have to bend your knees.

728
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:51,066
Never saw you do that with Cian.

729
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:54,027
Who's Cian?

730
00:44:54,111 --> 00:44:56,506
It's just an old friend
I used to play boule with back in the day.

731
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:58,031
Ran off with his girlfriend.

732
00:44:58,115 --> 00:44:59,700
Shut the fuck up, Naill!

733
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:03,161
Sorry.

734
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:04,246
Is that true?

735
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:06,957
No. No, she was actually my fiancée.

736
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,667
Shit. He was your friend?

737
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,837
Yeah. Yeah, he was also
the lead singer of my band.

738
00:45:13,172 --> 00:45:15,340
He looked a lot better in skinny jeans,
in fairness.

739
00:45:16,091 --> 00:45:19,178
I'm sorry you lost your girl.
And your friend.

740
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:22,139
Yeah, threw me off for a while.

741
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:24,933
And what about now?

742
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:28,187
Now? Now I'm on my guard.

743
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,525
I think you should have another go.

744
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:31,792
It's been a while since
I looked through the old family photos.

745
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:35,420
You think it'd be upsetting,
but it's joyful. Yeah.

746
00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:36,964
All those memories.

747
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,716
Dad's rockabilly hair.

748
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,468
I know! Huh?

749
00:46:41,552 --> 00:46:43,971
Oh, God, her pointy tits.

750
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:45,472
They were a lovely couple.

751
00:46:46,098 --> 00:46:48,642
Of tits?

752
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,395
I'm sorry you lost some of your photos.

753
00:46:52,896 --> 00:46:57,067
Made me think of that one you've got
of Mom and Dad at the Forty Foot.

754
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,944
We should get copies made of that,
you know,

755
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:01,655
just in case something happens,
for all of us.

756
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:04,741
That's a lovely idea.
Do you think you'll be able to restore it?

757
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:08,787
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
- Brilliant. Okay, look, I'll go grab it.

758
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:11,164
- Okay. All right.
- And I'll be back in a minute.

759
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:44,781
I spilled some of the...
Some of the tea.

760
00:47:46,325 --> 00:47:47,326
- Here.
- Yeah, give me.

761
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:48,827
I'll grab a cloth.

762
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,622
It's a nice thing you're doing.

763
00:47:51,705 --> 00:47:52,915
Yeah, I hope so.

764
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:58,462
Look at you. Boobless.

765
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:04,510
I may have been a late developer.

766
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:08,347
I love you.

767
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:12,226
Love you too.

768
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:02,776
Hey, honey. I'm just in the middle of
supper here. Can I call you back?

769
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:06,029
Oh, you are?
I was just thinking about you.

770
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:07,823
That's sweet.

771
00:49:07,906 --> 00:49:09,157
Yeah.

772
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:12,786
I was just... Well, I was just wondering...
I was just wondering how... how you are.

773
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:14,830
I'm grand. Why?

774
00:49:14,913 --> 00:49:16,832
No... No... No reason. I was just...

775
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:19,376
Oh, honey, look, I have to go.
I'm boiling over here.

776
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:20,836
Okay. I... I love you!

777
00:49:20,919 --> 00:49:22,129
Call you back. Bye.

778
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:26,425
Mom? Mom.

779
00:49:33,223 --> 00:49:34,558
God's sake.

780
00:50:22,814 --> 00:50:24,399
Urs, we haven't heard from Grace.

781
00:50:24,483 --> 00:50:25,984
I haven't either.

782
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:27,819
Jesus Christ, I'm going out of my mind.

783
00:50:27,903 --> 00:50:30,531
Will you come over?
Everybody's left now.

784
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:31,615
We're on our way.

785
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:33,367
Put the kettle on.

786
00:50:43,669 --> 00:50:45,462
- Would've worked by now, right?
- Yeah.

787
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:48,799
Oh, shit.

788
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:52,427
I can... I can't answer it. I can't.

789
00:50:52,511 --> 00:50:53,679
No, I can't. No.

790
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:55,722
No, don't. Don't fucking...

791
00:50:58,350 --> 00:50:59,351
Hey, honey.

792
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:02,896
He's dead, Eva.

793
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:05,649
He's dead.

794
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:10,320
Just... Te...
Just tell me what happened, Grace.

795
00:51:10,404 --> 00:51:14,408
He didn't wake up this morning.
Heart failure in his sleep.

796
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:16,368
Oh, God.

797
00:51:17,452 --> 00:51:19,413
Well... Well, at-at least, you know it...

798
00:51:19,496 --> 00:51:21,373
This is just awful.

799
00:51:21,456 --> 00:51:23,917
I keep thinking maybe it's...

800
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:26,170
It's best this way, you know?
He was getting on.

801
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:30,048
We're gonna bury him
in the garden this afternoon.

802
00:51:30,132 --> 00:51:31,633
In the garden?

803
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:32,968
Is Bibi there?

804
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:35,596
Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, she...

805
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:37,055
Oh, my God, it's Oscar.

806
00:51:38,557 --> 00:51:40,559
He was such a good dog.

807
00:51:40,642 --> 00:51:44,605
Such a gentle soul.

808
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:46,732
- Oh, no, no, no. No.
- Oh, my God.

809
00:51:47,482 --> 00:51:49,067
Poor Blanaid.

810
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:50,485
Oh, God.

811
00:51:52,154 --> 00:51:53,614
Well, look it's…

812
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:55,115
No.

813
00:51:58,285 --> 00:51:59,453
Oh, Gracie.

814
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,629
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

815
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:13,091
Yeah, it's all right.

816
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:29,733
Can you just drop me here?

817
00:52:29,816 --> 00:52:32,110
- What's that?
- Can you just let me off here?

818
00:52:40,786 --> 00:52:43,038
What's so special about here?

819
00:52:43,121 --> 00:52:44,706
That was gonna be mine.

820
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:50,254
First floor of that building there?
My first business.

821
00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:53,757
Sorry.

822
00:52:56,218 --> 00:52:57,970
It just winded me, seeing it.

823
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:01,682
What happened?

824
00:53:05,018 --> 00:53:10,941
You know, I had no money, and a
family member was supposed to help me out.

825
00:53:11,942 --> 00:53:13,443
Sort of landed me in it.

826
00:53:16,405 --> 00:53:17,489
I lost money.

827
00:53:19,408 --> 00:53:21,243
Lost my confidence, I think.

828
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:23,829
I had a lot of big plans.

829
00:53:24,621 --> 00:53:26,665
Don't know where they're gone now.

830
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:37,092
I don't think
those insurance twats

831
00:53:37,176 --> 00:53:38,936
are gonna stop
until they get what they want.

832
00:53:39,011 --> 00:53:40,012
Move.

833
00:53:41,847 --> 00:53:44,516
They went to the hotel
me and Ben used to meet at.

834
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,893
Jesus.

835
00:53:45,976 --> 00:53:47,976
They thought John Paul
and I were having an affair.

836
00:53:49,354 --> 00:53:50,355
How is that funny?

837
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:55,235
Sorry, it's not.
It's... It's a horrible image.

838
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:59,156
I'm pretty sure that ginger one
went through my medicine cabinet.

839
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:01,325
They better not try that shit on me.

840
00:54:01,408 --> 00:54:03,052
Jesus Christ,
this is making me so stressed.

841
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:04,077
Why?

842
00:54:06,163 --> 00:54:08,540
Seriously, what have they got? Really?

843
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:11,835
They're so wide off the mark.

844
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:14,922
We just have to keep
checking in with each other.

845
00:54:15,756 --> 00:54:18,717
Okay? Backing each other's stories,
playing it safe.

846
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,386
And we'll be fine.

847
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:30,521
As long as Becka keeps her mouth shut.
