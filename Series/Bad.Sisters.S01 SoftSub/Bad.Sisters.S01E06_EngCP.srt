1
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:44,127
JP!

2
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,759
Mom!

3
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,220
Mom, are you there?

4
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,223
Because, seriously,
I can't go in like this.

5
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,933
It's all creases.

6
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,890
You will take care out there today,
won't you? With Gerald.

7
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,518
I wasn't planning on killing the man,
Grace.

8
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,103
It's a honey trap, hence the honey.

9
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,940
- What's wrong with you?
- Bibi's still not answering my calls.

10
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:31,235
Of course she isn't. She's in
a state of shame and rightfully so.

11
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,778
I say, leave her to it.

12
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:33,946
It was an accident.

13
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:38,367
What was a one-eyed woman doing out there
in the first place, shooting a gun?

14
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,618
Because we invited her.

15
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:43,497
Well, it wasn't "we"
who half-blinded a man, was it?

16
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,083
There's your villain. Let her stew in it.

17
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,502
Where are you off to all dressed up?

18
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,713
Dressed up? I'm wearing a coat.

19
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,760
I'm going to an art class.

20
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,888
I think that's great.

21
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:04,184
Lesser women would've been knocked
by what they did to you at dance class.

22
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,437
I used to be good at art.

23
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,441
Did you? Can't remember.

24
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,403
Have fun.

25
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,051
Sorry.
There's no talking to her at the moment.

26
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:23,245
- She just doesn't want to see anyone.
- Well, we're hardly anyone. Are we?

27
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,748
I know, and I'd love for you to come in
and shake her out of it, I would,

28
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,459
but she's not like herself. I'm sorry.

29
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,299
Well, then forget her.

30
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,720
I don't know why I'm having to come to her
anyway. She's the one who split my lip.

31
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,471
Nutjob.

32
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,817
Is this the very day?

33
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:58,614
What?

34
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,783
The boat. Is today the very day
we get to take her out?

35
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,244
Talk me through your thinking here, Roger.

36
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:09,249
Would I have carted her all the way
down here to what? Surprise you?

37
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,627
Does it matter why you carted it
all the way down here?

38
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,045
Exactly.

39
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,130
Why did you cart her
all the way down here?

40
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,593
I'm taking Gerald, my boss,

41
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,969
out for an after...

42
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,471
One second.

43
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:29,853
Everything all right?

44
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,731
No show?

45
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:39,279
You know, when God closes the door,
you just open a window.

46
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,658
I've got all the gear.

47
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:47,621
We could head out. Cast a wee line.
Breathe in no better air.

48
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,290
I was expecting lemonade, Roger.

49
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,377
Don't much fancy sucking the lemon.

50
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:13,480
So, how do you feel about carrying on
after everything that's happened?

51
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,527
Him. It. Carrying on.

52
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,989
All I can think about right now is
what happened to that poor fucker's eye.

53
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,992
And that it was Bibi, of all people,
who pulled the trigger.

54
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,371
So, no more collateral damage.

55
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,790
If we were going to try again,

56
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:36,753
we need zero risk of dogs and people and
anything getting caught in the cross fire.

57
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,548
Yes, so we may as well
just light a candle,

58
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,301
hope he drowns himself in his bath
at night.

59
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,346
Why didn't I think of that?

60
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,933
Think of what? Asking him to kill himself?

61
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:54,897
No, drugging him.
Putting him in a very full bath.

62
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,651
Ursula, you've told me hundreds of times
that drugs show up in a postmortem.

63
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:02,821
Rohypnol doesn't. There's no trace of it.

64
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:05,407
It's the same reason
why most rape trials fall apart.

65
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,410
I could get some from work.

66
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,329
Won't be missed.

67
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,415
What do you think?

68
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,876
I don't...

69
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,377
I think...

70
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,674
I think nothing happens
unless Bibi's back.

71
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,510
Yeah.

72
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,096
I don't wanna tell you
how to live your life,

73
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,101
but you should consider keeping your wine
in the fridge like a poor person.

74
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,942
Min! Which one?

75
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,444
Anything with alcohol, darling.

76
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,577
What are you doing down there?

77
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,955
Grabbing wine and seeing Min.

78
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,624
Well, I told you,
nobody needs you coming around here.

79
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:56,750
Go home.

80
00:06:56,834 --> 00:07:00,462
- She's my friend.
- Is that what she told you?

81
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:03,715
Any old excuse to come around here
and drink up my inheritance.

82
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,425
Your inheritance? Are you joking me?

83
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,389
She's just here for your money
because she couldn't weasel any out of me.

84
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,721
You're a slimy piece of shit.

85
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,432
- You're a scheming bitch.
- Children! Less of this.

86
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,270
Leave your sister be, John Paul.

87
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:20,274
Your father will be home soon,
and you mustn't rile his temper again.

88
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,525
Mama…

89
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,988
He's not coming home.

90
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,781
Oh, my God.

91
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,784
Why would you say that to her?
What does it give you?

92
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,662
Go snatch a purse.
There'll be less work in it for you.

93
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,497
You should be the one who goes.

94
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,250
No one called for you.

95
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,752
Mum. You silly thing.

96
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,796
You need help.

97
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:47,092
You need to go into that care home
we talked about.

98
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,011
Remember?

99
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:50,846
Professional care.

100
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,932
- For your own good.
- Just go.

101
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:55,934
Do as she says.

102
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,274
What won't you stoop to?

103
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,776
Incredible.

104
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,113
- Min, are you okay?
- Yes.

105
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:09,823
Min?

106
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,326
He can't just do that.

107
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:16,371
I mean,
he can't just put you in a home. Can he?

108
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,501
Min? Min! Seriously?

109
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:25,088
I signed it. I didn't want you
getting all the bloody credit.

110
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,135
That's some pretty racy content, Min.

111
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,970
Extra surprise for my girl.

112
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,972
What's that?

113
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,933
The fees for next term.

114
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,232
For God's sake, dear. We can't have you
coming back here without an education.

115
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,735
Your father would marry you off
to a fat farmer.

116
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,867
Eight grand.

117
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,423
All right, folks. Let's pause it there.

118
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:09,508
Give Monica ten minutes

119
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,801
to shake her bones out.

120
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,139
Hiya, Margo. Nice to see you're back.

121
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,892
- I like the colors you're using there.
- Oh, yeah.

122
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,686
Captures her hair well.

123
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,357
Great.

124
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:33,782
This is good.

125
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,201
Is it? I don't know.

126
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:37,828
It is.

127
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,494
I can tell by the way
you're using your line though,

128
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,750
bit nervous
drawing the more intimate parts.

129
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,922
Surely by now, you're a woman at home
in her own body, no?

130
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,551
I'm not sure my husband
would necessarily agree with you.

131
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,761
What's it got to do with him?

132
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,015
It's your body to be comfortable with.

133
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,542
What the hell?

134
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,641
There he is now,
creeping around like Benjamin Franklin.

135
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,132
That's an impressive reference.

136
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,896
I just watched a documentary on him.
What a perv.

137
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,857
So now I'm a perv?

138
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,610
Take it you won't be having one of these.

139
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,154
I'm watching you.

140
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,870
- How are you this morning?
- I am disabled with anxiety.

141
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,622
- You?
- Same. Overflowing with guilt.

142
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,250
But other than that…

143
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,255
What are you doing today?

144
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,091
I was thinking
of actually taking the day off.

145
00:11:56,175 --> 00:12:00,470
If you're free
we could do something together.

146
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,600
Are you gonna wear trousers?

147
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,104
Do you want me to wear trousers?

148
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,856
Oh, yeah.

149
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:15,068
Both your balls
are hanging out of my poor shorts.

150
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:25,662
Come on, you stupid f... Dick!

151
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:29,291
Find something. See something.

152
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,674
Does "released without charge"
mean nothing to you people?

153
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,551
- Sorry?
- Are you now?

154
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:42,638
Well, the last lot of concerned citizens
I had 'round here

155
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,681
got a lot worse off the guards
than I ever did.

156
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,727
Sir, excuse me. Sorry.

157
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,981
Did you... Were you friends
with John Paul Williams by any chance?

158
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:58,487
- And who are you supposed to be?
- Does it matter to the question?

159
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,449
Let me tell you something.

160
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,744
There's no such thing
as being friends with that man.

161
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:06,828
Do you hear me?

162
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,664
They say don't speak ill of the dead,

163
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,083
but I say it's just a shame

164
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,586
that he didn't do himself in properly
the first time he tried.

165
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,429
- Bla, I love you.
- Love you too.

166
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,058
Morning, all.

167
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,643
More questions?

168
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,270
- Mam.
- Bye, hon.

169
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,354
Bye.

170
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:34,815
What happened to your face?

171
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,859
Nothing.
Just... You should see my wife.

172
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,862
That was a joke. May I?

173
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,494
You're on your own today.

174
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,289
That's right.
Can't get the help these days.

175
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,416
Everyone's after a million quid
for doing nothing.

176
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:57,296
Just his day off is all.

177
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:01,258
You've been doing some rearranging?

178
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,843
Trying to anyway.

179
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,846
Nearly bust a gut moving this thing.

180
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,474
Wanted it here since forever, but…

181
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:13,353
JP? Wasn't so keen?

182
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:14,730
No, but…

183
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:19,902
wouldn't do much good
to preserve the place in aspic.

184
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,825
Grace, I'm afraid I have to ask.

185
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,786
How do I put this?

186
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,414
Did JP ever try to harm himself?

187
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:34,750
What have you heard?

188
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:39,421
I wouldn't ask if
it wasn't entirely pertinent to the claim.

189
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,097
What?

190
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,238
Roger, you're an angel.

191
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:07,658
I've been at JP to prune those for weeks.

192
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,326
Hiya, Gracie.

193
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,496
I hope you don't mind.
It was just that I was doing me own

194
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:16,041
and I thought maybe I'll come over
and, you know, save you the bother.

195
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,169
Oh, Roger. I ne...

196
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:22,005
- I never had you as a mover, Roger.
- Oh, God. Aye.

197
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,466
See, my mother sent me for lessons
when I was a kid.

198
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,677
Only way
I was gonna get myself a woman.

199
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,138
She used to say, learn to dance
and you're in with a chance.

200
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,600
Come on then, you.

201
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,524
You're some mover.

202
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,073
What on earth?

203
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,327
Jesus Christ.

204
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,377
Give the nod when you wanna cut in, JP.

205
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,922
What a terrible, terrible noise.

206
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:07,342
Remember, we nearly had a soul deejay
at our wedding

207
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,178
till you said he was too expensive.

208
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,388
Can you not get a wife of your own?

209
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,473
Sure. Who would have me?

210
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,184
Look at the bushes, JP.

211
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,686
Roger, bless him, pruned them for you.

212
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:20,939
Lovely day down at the quay.

213
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,650
Probably would've been better
if you got the boat out, huh?

214
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,611
Oh, yeah. How'd you get on?

215
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,948
Fine. Got on fine.

216
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:31,533
Come on.

217
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,244
Thank you for the dance, my lady.

218
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:35,329
Thank you.

219
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:39,833
JP.

220
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:44,213
Do you know you're a very lucky man?

221
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:46,965
I wake up smiling, Roger.

222
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,180
Yeah, I bet you do.

223
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,734
Hello.

224
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:15,035
I'm a local parent and I wish
to raise a red flag regards an individual.

225
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:20,540
The issue is
my son attends a church youth group,

226
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:24,877
and the guy running it
has shown an unnatural interest in my son.

227
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,966
I'm worried he's molesting him.

228
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,177
Oh, yes. Yes.
I am prepared to name the man. I am.

229
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,471
Yeah. Yes.

230
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,723
His name is Roger Muldoon.

231
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,852
Double O, Muldoon. That's right. Yes.

232
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,396
Thank you.

233
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:30,444
Come on.

234
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:42,789
So, tell me then about your day.

235
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,333
Where's my book?

236
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:46,668
Your book?

237
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,797
Book. Object of fiction,
loads of pages bound together with glue.

238
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,467
Are you okay?

239
00:18:54,676 --> 00:19:00,390
You weren't jealous earlier on, were you?
About Roger?

240
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,310
What are you wearing?

241
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,312
Is that new?

242
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:06,522
Do you like it?

243
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,026
What do you think you look like?

244
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,612
What? What does that mean?

245
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,114
Do you know
when you look your most beautiful?

246
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,827
When I can't see any of them in you.

247
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,414
So, it's my sisters' fault
you don't look at me like that anymore?

248
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:26,583
Don't do that, Gracie.

249
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,252
Don't debase yourself.

250
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,552
I know you hate talking about it…

251
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:42,266
but we could try

252
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,894
things you can take to help.

253
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:49,731
There's no shame in just trying the pills,
John Paul.

254
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,192
Lots of men take them.

255
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:56,530
This cheap thing
makes you say cheap things.

256
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,950
Get a grip of yourself.

257
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:47,789
You know the Galway netball tournament,
the overnight?

258
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:50,709
Tomorrow? Do you need some money for it?

259
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,463
One of the other moms dropped out.

260
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:56,548
I was wondering if you'd come?

261
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:58,884
Hon.

262
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,429
You know, you don't need to look after me.

263
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:04,473
Course I do.

264
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:06,808
It's just a dropout…

265
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,813
and an excuse to get you away
to lavish money on me.

266
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:16,527
Cheeky.

267
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,582
Do you think it's me?

268
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,336
Grace, no. Not on your worst week.

269
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,755
It's him. Of course it's him.

270
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:40,425
Thing is, I still look at him

271
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:43,887
and I still think he's bloody gorgeous.

272
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:46,640
Maybe that's just marriage.

273
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:52,271
I mean, I wouldn't say as much as that.

274
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,314
So, you and Donal still

275
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:56,608
have sex?

276
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:01,238
We... I keep my hand in.

277
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,407
Oh, my God. It is me.

278
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:10,956
Grace, you're a natural-born feckin' ride.

279
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:13,417
Of course it's his fault.

280
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:15,252
You wanna have sex.

281
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,962
It's him who's gone rancid.

282
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:19,548
When did you last actually…

283
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:25,888
- Jesus.
- I know.

284
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:30,392
Maybe, I mean...
Maybe I have let myself go.

285
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:33,562
Sorry.

286
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,441
Nah, I'm joking. It's box fresh.
Never been used.

287
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:39,651
Take it must be going pretty well
with Grant then.

288
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:40,736
It's Gabriel.

289
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,405
No, not really. He's gay.

290
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:45,574
Gabriel's gay.

291
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:48,368
Well, it's very nice.

292
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:49,494
No, it's for you.

293
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,247
- Take it home.
- Get it where you can, sis.

294
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,583
That's her motto.
Ah, f...

295
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,210
Well, thanks, I think.

296
00:22:58,504 --> 00:23:00,631
- I have to go.
- Okay.

297
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,592
I just wish to God he'd try the pills.

298
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,304
But maybe he just doesn't see me
like that anymore,

299
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:10,807
or as a person worth listening to.

300
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:13,060
There is not a thing wrong with you.

301
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:16,188
Yeah. Well, that's the great thing
about you lot.

302
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,564
You have to say that.

303
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,069
- Bye, honey.
- Bye, love.

304
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:25,572
The poor thing.

305
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,368
We have to see this through, Eva.

306
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,131
There's not gonna be anything left of her.

307
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,121
Not without Bibi.

308
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:39,461
You need to go and talk to her.
Make things right.

309
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:41,547
You.

310
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:09,092
Gracie.

311
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:29,279
I think you are, if you'll forgive
my bluntness, skirting around the issue.

312
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:30,683
Will you help me out here, Grace?

313
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,258
What is it
you think I should be telling you?

314
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:33,283
His mental health.

315
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:35,911
Was he depressed? Were there any affairs?

316
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:37,996
Because I need to take
the view here, Grace,

317
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,624
as to how likely it is
that your husband died by his own hand.

318
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:43,418
You think I owe you
the sensitive details of my marriage?

319
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:44,711
No, probably not.

320
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:48,924
Sorry. I'm...

321
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:54,388
I'm under a lot of pressure
from everywhere.

322
00:25:56,682 --> 00:25:58,767
And my wife and I are expecting a baby.

323
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,979
So I'm barely sleeping.

324
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:05,607
He was the same.

325
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:12,906
John Paul. Before Blanaid... Full of worry.

326
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:16,285
Yeah,
but also it's the size of everything.

327
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:18,871
You know,
she takes up a lot of space in the bed.

328
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,456
But, yeah, you know, the worry too.

329
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,585
Talk about male fragility, hey?

330
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:28,005
You'd think it'd be the mothers losing it,
but Theresa's fine.

331
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:32,926
Happy as,
laid up on the bed like bloody Boudicca.

332
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:37,222
I think I might have something for you.

333
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:43,020
They were Blanaid's.

334
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:49,026
They might not be in fashion now.

335
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:57,284
Well, thanks. Thanks very much.

336
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,705
- There is a difference.
- Sorry?

337
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:05,876
Between skirting around the details
because you're trying to hide something

338
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,920
and skirting around the details

339
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:11,757
because they're incredibly hard
to look at head-on.

340
00:27:16,053 --> 00:27:21,517
The reason I don't talk about JP's
suicide attempt is because he wouldn't.

341
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:26,647
There's only so much I can know.
Mostly from his doctors.

342
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:33,278
The other reason is, deep down,
I have to wonder…

343
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,033
was it because of me?

344
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,704
Was I the reason he once wanted to die?

345
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:53,257
Hey, Siri. Plot me a route
from here to the local hospital.

346
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:04,560
Well, now.
Hadn't that plenty to say for itself.

347
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,895
- We didn't release that one.
- Good.

348
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:11,692
Joking. Nice bass. Very bassy.

349
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,371
Does he know you're with me?

350
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:28,584
Nor do my lot.

351
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,879
Really? You all seem so close.

352
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:34,715
We are. But you're a Claffin.

353
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,843
You're currently
making our lives a misery, so…

354
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:40,626
Plus, they're still my sisters.

355
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,973
They generally don't approve
of who's in my bed.

356
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:45,642
- They think you make bad choices?
- I usually do.

357
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,271
Hey.

358
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:53,317
I wonder sometimes, you know,
with my mam and dad not here...

359
00:28:54,359 --> 00:29:00,032
That I'm doing it because I want someone
to tell me I deserve better.

360
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:02,659
Do you think they
would've interfered like that?

361
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:03,827
Jesus. I hope so.

362
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:06,788
I've gone out with some real reprobates.

363
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:12,753
Sometimes, I think they still might.

364
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:15,464
What do you mean?

365
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:18,258
I don't know.

366
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:21,136
Maybe some night I'll be sat with some lad

367
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:25,599
who's not some arbitrary arsehole.

368
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:28,602
And maybe I'll hear

369
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,397
music or something.

370
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:36,777
Too bonkers?

371
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:41,114
You tell me something about you, then.
Something grisly.

372
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:51,917
Grisly?

373
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:58,966
Well, I just found out that my dad
didn't just up and die.

374
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:02,177
He actually killed himself.

375
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,722
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

376
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,476
Found out
Thomas had been keeping it from me.

377
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,144
Jesus.

378
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:14,106
Maybe it was a kindness?

379
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:17,734
What sort of kindness is that?

380
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:20,946
I don't know. A misguided one?

381
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,785
I mean, I get that you're hurting,

382
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:30,372
but if the cost of that is
your relationship with your only brother,

383
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:34,042
then price is too high.

384
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:38,172
'Cause take it from me…

385
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:41,758
you only have each other.

386
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:53,937
Jesus.

387
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:14,082
- Here.
- Jesus. I owe you one.

388
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:16,293
Expect those cup final tickets
in the post.

389
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:17,377
Yeah. Sure.

390
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:34,895
Okay.

391
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:40,817
F...

392
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:44,696
Hey, it's me again, obviously.

393
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:46,757
Just in case you didn't recognize the...

394
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:50,661
I know you have nothing but good reasons
for not picking up your phone.

395
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:54,331
I know you're angry with me,
and we've lots to talk about.

396
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:58,210
But for God's sake, pick up your phone,
listen to this and call me back.

397
00:31:58,293 --> 00:31:59,795
I've got a hold of something big.

398
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:04,174
And if it's as big as I've decided it is,
it's gonna save both our arses.

399
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:07,886
So please, Matt, for the sake
of my f... gastric acid if nothing else,

400
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,054
just talk to me.

401
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:28,115
If you're gonna hit me again,
do you mind aiming for the bottom lip?

402
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:30,576
Even things out.

403
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,997
For God's sake. Fine. I deserved it.

404
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,958
Well, what about him in there? He didn't.

405
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:43,172
I shot his bloody eye out, Becka.

406
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:45,966
Do you know what that looks like?
'Cause I have a pretty full idea.

407
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:54,391
I thought I was owed this.
And to get even for myself.

408
00:32:56,894 --> 00:32:59,271
And all I managed to do was this
to someone else.

409
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,691
Well, I pushed you.

410
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,235
So it's my fault.

411
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:12,367
The only mistake you made
was thinking that any of this was for you.

412
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,997
It should have been for your sister.

413
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:22,294
He's ground her down so small, Bibi.

414
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:24,588
I was with her earlier.

415
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:28,592
She doesn't even see herself
as a woman anymore.

416
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:32,221
There'll be nothing left of her soon.

417
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:35,057
And Blanaid's next.

418
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:48,695
Tomorrow night,
Grace is taking Blanaid to Galway.

419
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:54,785
We're gonna roofie him
and put him in a very full bath.

420
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,162
We need you there.

421
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:03,043
No, this has to stop.

422
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:05,796
Why? What the hell's changed?

423
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:07,172
What do you think?

424
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:09,132
Him in there?

425
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:13,804
Well, if we don't finish the job,
then what has he lost his eye for?

426
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:14,929
Nothing at all.

427
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:23,522
You okay?

428
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:26,190
- Okay. Enter your room.
- Thank you.

429
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:27,734
Careful now.

430
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:29,902
You're heading for the wall. I've got you.

431
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:34,116
You gonna be the boss now?

432
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:37,369
Well, you gotta get used to…

433
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:51,132
What's going on?

434
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:54,678
No. I'll find out.

435
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:59,266
Can you explain to me
exactly what was said?

436
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:00,350
Can I call my sister?

437
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:02,436
You'll be allowed a phone call
at the station.

438
00:35:06,148 --> 00:35:08,483
Excuse me. What's going on?

439
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:10,110
Can't tell you that.

440
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:12,487
- We've gotta go.
- Yeah.

441
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,372
JP, what's it all about?

442
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:24,928
Well, what do you think it's usually about

443
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,169
when the police confiscate
a man's computer?

444
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:29,588
Sad.

445
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:39,765
Doesn't sound like much of a yes.

446
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:42,142
Well, it wasn't a no either.

447
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:44,019
Was she pleased to see you?

448
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:46,188
- Yeah.
- Really?

449
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:47,397
Course she wasn't.

450
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:53,403
Bibi.

451
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:57,115
I'm really glad you're here.

452
00:35:57,908 --> 00:35:58,909
You okay?

453
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:03,580
Hug me back, you cow.

454
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:09,878
Okay.

455
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,215
So, someone talk me
through this plan then.

456
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:16,802
Right. So, Ursula reckons
that she can nick a bottle of Rohypnol

457
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:19,471
from the hospital and provided that works,

458
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,684
we gotta figure out
a means of just getting it into him.

459
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:30,858
And that's it?

460
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:34,194
Well, there's the bath, Eva.

461
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:36,989
- Tell her about the bath.
- You already told me about the bath.

462
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:46,164
Let Urs know to be there around 8:00.

463
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,625
The prick's like a child.

464
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:51,753
He can't cook, won't learn
and he's too tight to pay for delivery.

465
00:36:51,837 --> 00:36:55,132
So at some stage tonight,
he'll leave to pick up some greasy shite.

466
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:56,425
Are we going in a window?

467
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:59,094
I lost my spare key to theirs years ago.

468
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:00,721
Yeah, well, I didn't.

469
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:03,390
Can we put the stuff in a drink?

470
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,726
Isn't that sort of, like,
you know, textbook?

471
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:08,729
- Put it in the milk.
- Not gonna put it in the milk.

472
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:11,190
Grace and Blanaid drink the milk.

473
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:13,942
They love milk.

474
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:19,573
- It's gotta be something that...
- His nasal spray.

475
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:24,828
I don't know what's in that stuff,
but he's basically addicted to it.

476
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:29,666
Remind me never to interrogate why Bibi
seems to be just naturally gifted at this.

477
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:34,129
You don't need to do it, you know?

478
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:35,923
Any of it.

479
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:40,010
It's him or Grace. Right?

480
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:42,930
So, yeah.

481
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:45,432
I think maybe I do, actually.

482
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:50,229
Okay.

483
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:55,651
So, I'll tell her you're back
and the plans on.

484
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:59,154
Right? Get her to do a little shopping
in the medical store.

485
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:16,505
All right, stranger?

486
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:19,925
Stranger? Didn't I pass you toilet paper
through a door earlier?

487
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:22,845
Yeah, but you were gone
by the time I was finished.

488
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:28,517
That's what you're after, following me
into the drug store like a bloody sneak.

489
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,519
I wasn't following you... Look, I was j...

490
00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:32,479
I was just stood in the bloody corridor.

491
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,650
Urs, are we okay?

492
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:37,734
What? I mean...

493
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:40,612
I'm entitled to ask,
and I feel like I should ask.

494
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:46,952
I feel like I haven't been able
to get through to you for a while now.

495
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:50,581
S... Like, is there a reason?

496
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:55,878
Can you put your arms around me?

497
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,631
It's me.

498
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:04,344
Feel like I've been a million miles away
from everything recently.

499
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:06,305
Including myself.

500
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:07,431
What's going on?

501
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:10,434
I don't know.

502
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,103
Do you still love me?

503
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:18,483
Oh, shite.

504
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:21,820
Takeaway tonight.

505
00:39:21,904 --> 00:39:23,363
- Talk about it then.
- I can't.

506
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:27,409
I'm sorry. I promised Carmel I'd leave it
open in case she needs me for a double.

507
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:29,786
All right. Well, soon then. All right?

508
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,205
Donal, come in.

509
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:33,665
Yep. On my way to you now.
I'll be two minutes.

510
00:40:09,785 --> 00:40:11,620
Come on, cookie. Let's go.

511
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:12,704
Gracie.

512
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:17,251
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Sorry.

513
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:20,963
I really had no idea
you were this unhappy with me.

514
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:22,214
Sorry?

515
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:26,343
I didn't say no, did I?
To trying your little funny blue pills.

516
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:27,594
JP, what is this?

517
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:31,390
- Blanaid is right there.
- Mum, we going?

518
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:33,600
- Right there.
- Is it porn too? Is it?

519
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:35,519
Should I be going through
the browser history

520
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:37,521
to find out what my wife is really into?

521
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:40,124
We can't do this now.
She's on the team, JP. I have to take her.

522
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:42,484
Please.

523
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:48,240
I have it
because we are not like that anymore,

524
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:51,243
and I need something.

525
00:40:51,326 --> 00:40:53,287
So, this is supposed to be my fault now,
is it?

526
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,914
- Well, is it mine?
- I'm not an old man, Grace.

527
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:58,876
So ask yourself,
"Could the reason be you?"

528
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:02,754
It mightn't have come to this
if you just put some effort into

529
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:05,549
being something
I want to get into bed with at night.

530
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:07,217
Don't you dare.

531
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:10,721
Don't you dare go put netball
before me and this marriage.

532
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:13,640
Grace! Grace, come back here!

533
00:41:34,995 --> 00:41:36,413
Jesus. Get in.

534
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:39,086
Marvelous time
you chose to take a piss, Ursula.

535
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,543
Talk to me
once you've pushed out a brace of kids.

536
00:41:42,044 --> 00:41:43,337
He didn't see me, did he?

537
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:46,215
Oh, shit.

538
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:51,261
Are you psychic?

539
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:53,729
How did you know
he was gonna go for takeaway?

540
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:55,849
You didn't drop the…

541
00:41:57,226 --> 00:41:59,686
What do we
if he comes back and we're in there?

542
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,146
We'll hide under Blanaid's bed.

543
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,458
- We're not hiding under Blanaid's bed.
- In the cupboard then.

544
00:42:03,482 --> 00:42:06,777
We're not hiding in cupboards
or under beds, okay? Jesus.

545
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,320
Are we gonna do this or not?

546
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:11,031
Well, if yes, then get going.
I'll keep watch.

547
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:21,041
Let's wear white to his funeral.

548
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:28,799
He's all but dependent on the stuff.

549
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:32,135
What kind of prick doesn't keep
his medicine in the medicine drawer?

550
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:34,263
What if he has it on him?

551
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:40,936
I've got it. It's here.

552
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,400
Stand back. Let the matron do her work.

553
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:49,152
Stop ignoring my calls, Grace.

554
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:52,739
Oh, Jesus. Oh, God.

555
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:57,536
Oh, shit.

556
00:42:58,078 --> 00:43:00,205
It's Bibi. Hey, what's up?

557
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:01,748
- He's back already.
- He's what?

558
00:43:01,832 --> 00:43:02,833
He's fucking here.

559
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:06,837
But if you don't come home right now,
God knows what I'll do.

560
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:11,048
Hurry up.

561
00:43:11,592 --> 00:43:12,926
- Fuck!
- Don't.

562
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,261
There. This way. Come on.

563
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:15,345
Okay.

564
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:17,639
Don't!

565
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:21,143
Why've you still got the... Urs!

566
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:25,314
Oh, shit.

567
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:27,149
No!

568
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:32,279
Can't fit under the bloody...

569
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:34,072
Move over.

570
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:35,908
- Fuck.
- Just...

571
00:43:39,578 --> 00:43:40,579
Will you be quiet?

572
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:42,414
Move your foot.

573
00:43:42,497 --> 00:43:43,832
Fine! Shit!

574
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:11,985
Becka?

575
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:13,904
Did you fart?

576
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:17,282
Oh, my God. What's the matter with you?

577
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:19,576
My stomach hurts when I get nervous.

578
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:21,703
He's gonna smell that.

579
00:44:44,017 --> 00:44:46,854
And good night.

580
00:44:49,398 --> 00:44:51,400
Come on! He's passed out.

581
00:44:51,942 --> 00:44:52,985
My tits.

582
00:44:55,654 --> 00:44:56,655
Sorry.

583
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:08,208
Why are you crawling like that?

584
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:20,262
Is he even breathing?

585
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,060
Just.

586
00:45:29,146 --> 00:45:30,606
Must've been quite a dose.

587
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:34,109
Okay. The bath's running.

588
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:37,237
Dibs on taking an arm.

589
00:45:37,988 --> 00:45:40,699
I bet the prick's got heavy legs.
He's built like a brick shithouse.

590
00:45:41,825 --> 00:45:45,204
- What the h... Why would you... What?
- What?

591
00:45:45,287 --> 00:45:48,290
- Why'd you do that that now?
- He has to go in naked.

592
00:45:48,373 --> 00:45:49,750
Why would you start there?

593
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,168
Oh, my God.

594
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:54,129
Oh, come on. Just... Come on. Let's get...

595
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:56,632
- Open his bloody stupid buttons.
- I can't.

596
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:15,651
What the hell?

597
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:18,278
Gerald should be here any moment.

598
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:19,571
What is he doing?

599
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:25,994
Is he pissing?

600
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:29,039
- What the fuck is going on?
- Is it not working?

601
00:46:29,122 --> 00:46:30,123
I don't know.

602
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:32,751
- He's peeing.
- He's having a slash.

603
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:09,580
- What is happening?
- He's gonna drive.

604
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:10,831
Just...

605
00:47:10,914 --> 00:47:12,374
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

606
00:47:12,457 --> 00:47:14,877
- He just took a wee in the closet.
- Come on!

607
00:47:23,177 --> 00:47:24,928
We're not seriously going after him,
are we?

608
00:47:26,054 --> 00:47:28,307
Someone knock the bath off.
Knock the bath off!

609
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:31,435
- Eva? That's not a no?
- Shut up and run!

610
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:37,149
- Wait!
- Come on!

611
00:47:37,816 --> 00:47:39,401
Where the hell is he going?

612
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:40,903
Hope we've got a plan B.

613
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:43,614
Yeah. Catch up with him
before he bloody kills someone.

614
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:45,240
Get in the car.

615
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:47,034
- Get in.
- I'm getting in.

616
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:48,118
Jesus!

617
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:50,704
- Move your arse, Ursula.
- I am. Yeah, okay.

618
00:47:51,288 --> 00:47:53,207
Oh, my God. He's gonna hit that bri...

619
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:55,250
Should we call the police?

620
00:47:55,334 --> 00:47:57,127
What if he's calling the police?

621
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,630
Oh, God. He's stopping.

622
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:02,382
He stopped.

623
00:48:05,802 --> 00:48:07,387
I gave him a massive dose.

624
00:48:07,471 --> 00:48:09,473
It should've knocked out
a fucking elephant.

625
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,266
Oh, my God.

626
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:15,854
What's his plan?

627
00:48:15,938 --> 00:48:17,481
Is that his stupid boat?

628
00:48:21,485 --> 00:48:22,861
What is he doing?

629
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:26,031
I am correct in remembering
he can't swim, right?

630
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:30,661
Yeah.

631
00:48:43,298 --> 00:48:45,175
- Is he taking the boat out?
- I don't know.

632
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:49,388
- For the love of God!
- Gross.

633
00:48:49,471 --> 00:48:50,556
Vile.

634
00:48:53,976 --> 00:48:55,352
Fuck me.

635
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:56,645
There was no need for that.

636
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:04,278
- J... Oh, my God. He's fallen in!
- That's what we want, you silly cow.

637
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:08,407
Oh, yeah.

638
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:18,041
Well, I guess a win is a win. Right?

639
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:21,128
It's happening.
