1
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:14,723
God.

2
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,218
Thought we were gonna see the widow?

3
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:12,698
We are.

4
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,076
We're just gonna have a word
with her sisters first.

5
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,428
Oh, fuck.

6
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:37,890
Oh, shit.

7
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,853
Shit. Fuck.

8
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,948
You know,
they have every right not to talk to us.

9
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,551
You know that, right? We're not Garda.

10
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,994
Absolutely.
I think they shouldn't talk to us.

11
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,430
What? Well, then, why are we here?

12
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,915
If they don't answer our questions,
we'll leave them alone,

13
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,458
admit defeat, pay out.

14
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:08,628
But if they invite us in,
we'll know they've got something to hide.

15
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:12,799
And then we'll haul each one of them
over hot coals until we get to the truth.

16
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,929
Sorry to bother.
Thomas Claffin, Claffin and Sons.

17
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,473
Yeah, I remember you.

18
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,061
Come in.

19
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,391
Do you mind if I record our conversation?

20
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:45,934
What for?

21
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:49,146
It's mostly just for,
you know, so I have it...

22
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,481
It's fine. Go ahead.

23
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,483
Do your thing.

24
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,068
Great.

25
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:04,203
Miss Garvey,
do you mind telling us where you were

26
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:07,831
the night of claim reference 1757318?

27
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,167
The night Mr. Williams died.

28
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:14,838
Do you mind telling me what my whereabouts
has to do with our claim?

29
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,091
When we're dealing with
a payout of this size, it's customary to...

30
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,927
Yeah, it's okay. I was with Grace.

31
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,428
We all were.

32
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,723
- All of you?
- Yeah.

33
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,807
Yeah, we're very close.

34
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,726
We get together as often as we can here.

35
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,936
Well, that's nice.

36
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,646
Tight-knit family.

37
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,899
I mean, I didn't even meet my brother
till he was about, what, five years old.

38
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,652
- Let's just stay on track.
- This is your brother?

39
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,862
- Thought he was your son.
- No.

40
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,281
How would he be my son?

41
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:44,826
- Well, just, it's Claffin and Sons.
- No, that's our father.

42
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,953
Yeah. Also, I'm 35.

43
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,120
We're half brothers.

44
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,914
Yeah? No shit.

45
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:55,379
You and the insured, Mr. Williams,
you were colleagues?

46
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:56,964
Yeah.

47
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:58,966
Were you very close?

48
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,179
We weren't very close.
No. We didn't get on.

49
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,181
Meaning?

50
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,350
Meaning you don't get to choose
your brother-in-law.

51
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,144
Right.

52
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,190
And you didn't think
that he was good enough for her or...

53
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,245
Sorry. It's a friend.

54
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,829
Friend.

55
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,583
Hi, this is Matt. Leave a message.

56
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,545
Very seductive.

57
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,131
You should
save something for the imagination.

58
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,591
A girl likes a little mystery.

59
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,761
So, Matt, I have a free night,

60
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:49,057
and I was wondering
if you maybe wanted to grab some dinner.

61
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:54,646
This is Becka, by the way.
From the pub. From the accident.

62
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,316
I said I'd massage you.

63
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,194
Oh, shit.

64
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,529
Not in a sexual way. It's...

65
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,032
Hello? Oh, shit.

66
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:06,950
Okay.

67
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,788
Now, the night the AD&D came into effect…

68
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,832
- That's accidental...
- Yeah, I get it. Yeah.

69
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,752
…do you remember anything
out of the ordinary?

70
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,339
Any odd behavior from the decedent?

71
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,925
- Do you mean John Paul?
- Yeah.

72
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,384
Just say that then.

73
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,263
Anything at work that may have
spilt over into your personal lives?

74
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,350
A quarrel perhaps?

75
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,186
Anything strange that night?

76
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,314
Well, there was something strange.

77
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,234
Actually, yeah, now that you mention it.

78
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,403
The weather was really bad.

79
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,199
I remember a tree had come down
along the main road.

80
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,283
And…

81
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,662
- And go on.
- Well...

82
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,831
Well, we were ordering in
from a Chinese restaurant,

83
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,377
but 20 minutes later,
there's a bang on the door.

84
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,379
And?

85
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,924
And he hands over a bag of Mexican food.

86
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:06,802
From a Chinese restaurant.

87
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:08,887
Like, a bunch of Mexican food.

88
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,057
Isn't that weird?

89
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,477
I thought that was weird.

90
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,031
Drive safe.

91
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,204
- Well, you can see why she's alone.
- Didn't give us much, did she?

92
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,331
She gave us plenty.

93
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:40,043
The cheeky remarks. The deflection.

94
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:44,399
- Something she didn't want to answer.
- It was you. She didn't wanna answer you.

95
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,800
I don't know.
I thought I was fairly charming.

96
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,304
Bit early for a fire.

97
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,765
Yeah. Clearly the godmother
of the murderous middle-aged sister gang

98
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,017
is burning evidence.

99
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,060
- Still a joke to you, is it?
- No.

100
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,956
But there's no evidence a crime was
committed. We should be looking for fraud.

101
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,691
Murder is fraud
when there's a life policy to pay out.

102
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,736
- Trust me. I've seen this before.
- When?

103
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,862
Get in the car.

104
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,410
- So, what now?
- Yeah. I've been thinking about this.

105
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,829
We need to exhume the body.

106
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,664
Exhume the... W...

107
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:19,499
When you say "we," do you mean you and I?

108
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,001
No. The coroner.

109
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,669
There was no postmortem.

110
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,046
Who knows what we find.

111
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,299
Fingerprints. Needle marks.
Maybe there was drugs in his system.

112
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,383
You've lost your mind.

113
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,147
It's better
than losing my bloody business,

114
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,887
which will happen if we don't prove

115
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,640
- that this man was murdered. Thank you.
- Murdered.

116
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,868
- What are you doing?
- Hang on.

117
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,412
What, Tom?

118
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:09,842
What are you doing?

119
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:11,927
Evidence, Matthew.

120
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,347
What the fuck?

121
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,390
Bye, Dad! I'll see you after school!

122
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:05,480
Gracie!

123
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:09,902
Need to get into work! It's quarter to!

124
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,486
Five seconds!

125
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,866
- Two seconds!
- All right.

126
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:20,829
Lovely.

127
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:25,167
I'm going to have a steam
after the gym, so let's eat at 8:00.

128
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,921
I have a stiff calf
I need some moist heat on.

129
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,964
Good idea. Get ready for the walk.

130
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:34,760
It's not a walk.
It's a 15K all-terrain elite hike.

131
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,763
Which by the way, none of your sisters
have sponsored me for.

132
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,431
They're probably just busy.

133
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:43,018
Break these in for me, will you?
Just wear them around the house.

134
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,563
And go to the salon while you're in town.

135
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,106
Treat yourself to a freshen up.

136
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,817
You think I need a freshen up?

137
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,694
Did I say "need"?

138
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,364
Thought I said "treat."

139
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,119
Gracie, honestly,
don't make me walk on glass.

140
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:23,851
What?

141
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,728
I just learned so much about you.

142
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,066
Wow! You're a completely different person
than I thought.

143
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,901
- Really?
- Yeah.

144
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,987
What did you think I was like?

145
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:39,867
I don't know. Thought you'd
be more classic, like Céline Dion, Cher.

146
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,244
Fuck off.

147
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,583
Fucking Céline Dion?

148
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,008
Architecture is God?

149
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,054
Oh, no, I bless myself because I
so desperately want that not to get built.

150
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,682
I like it.

151
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,392
Why? You not a fan of change?

152
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,104
What? You like it?

153
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,023
Yeah, I'm a fan of change.

154
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,775
I mean, normally I love what we do,
but that's just…

155
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,612
Look at that. That is a street crime.

156
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,489
And it's gonna bankrupt us.

157
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:23,619
A little bird told me
you're about to be financial director.

158
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:25,370
Maybe.

159
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:28,373
Who do I have to sleep with
to get an opportunity like that?

160
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,834
- Me.
- What?

161
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,044
What do you mean? What?

162
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,754
- No, I was just...
- No, I was joking.

163
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,881
I... Lost in translation. I...

164
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,675
Gerald! You'd have to sleep with Gerald.

165
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,845
- Well, I'm pleased.
- What's he doing in?

166
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,097
He's never normally here this early.

167
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,850
Yeah. Maybe he's filing a complaint
against himself.

168
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:47,935
Morning, team.

169
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,522
Gabriel, we never really had
a chance to talk.

170
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,148
How are you settling in? All good?

171
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:54,358
Yes, great, thank you.

172
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,610
But we've met and talked several times.

173
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,694
Obvi... Yes, of course.

174
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,578
But anything I can do to help
to give you the smoothest entry possible,

175
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:01,657
just say.

176
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,617
- Jesus Christ.
- Eva?

177
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,161
I just put my hat in the ring
for the financial director post.

178
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:08,539
Gerald's pleased, of course.

179
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,542
So I hope you don't mind
a little friendly competition

180
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,878
from the one person here
who knows your dirty secrets.

181
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:16,964
Just joking.

182
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:20,843
What?

183
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:37,651
I have to go home. I have to get there
before Donal and the kids get back.

184
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:39,862
What are you doing?

185
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,406
Hold on.

186
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,032
What are you do... I said I had to go.

187
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:47,035
- Hang on, are you writing on me?
- Just hold still.

188
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,081
That really tickles. Okay.

189
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,091
Why would you do something so stupid?

190
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,219
I don't know.

191
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,680
Maybe being with you
makes me do stupid things.

192
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:20,068
- I feel like I've run 10K.
- I could go another right now.

193
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,364
So, will I get to see you tomorrow?

194
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,288
Yeah, I hope so.
As long as I get back before...

195
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,036
Oh, for fuck's sake.
It's my brother-in-law. He's a prick.

196
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,370
Hi, JP.

197
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,414
- You're a long way from home.
- Yeah.

198
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,376
You gonna introduce us?

199
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,505
Yeah, of course. It's... This is Ben.

200
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,882
He's my photography teacher.

201
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,760
I just had a class.

202
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:48,222
We all need our outlets, don't we?
Keeps life from getting stale.

203
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,140
How's she getting on?

204
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,100
Yeah. She's great.

205
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:53,810
She's a talent.

206
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,354
I'm sure she is.

207
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,440
Well, back to class.

208
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,866
Here we go. Home again.

209
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,826
Thanks for taking me shopping, Auntie Eva.

210
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,036
You coming in?

211
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:15,666
- No. I've a stack of work on, so…
- All right. Bye.

212
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,000
- Hey!
- Hey.

213
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,085
Come in!

214
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:19,795
Please.

215
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,922
Fuck's sake. Okay.

216
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:24,633
Okay.

217
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,011
I don't know if that would be enough.

218
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,597
Do it! Do the drop. Do the...

219
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,683
- Oh, God!
- Wow.

220
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,017
Then, whoa.

221
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:37,855
You can do it. You do it.

222
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,231
You got the moves.

223
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:40,983
Another bag of goodies?

224
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,110
Yeah, well. That's what aunties are for.

225
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,195
Not all aunties.
Do you remember Auntie Orla?

226
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,906
Is this a terrible thing to say?
Is she dead?

227
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,033
Yes, Eva. She is dead.

228
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,619
But it's hard to remember it
'cause she was ill for so long.

229
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:53,996
And then she got better.

230
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,831
And then she disappeared.

231
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,147
I was gonna say.
Lizzo's playing in Dublin next week.

232
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:03,714
Birthday present for the Blanaid?

233
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,340
- Over my dead body.
- Yes.

234
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:06,425
- Hey.
- Hey.

235
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,678
Eva, to what do we owe the pleasure?

236
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,055
I was just dropping Blanaid back.

237
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,057
Do you know what? I should head off now.

238
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15,767
How was school, sweetheart?

239
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,787
Did you get your mark back
on your photosynthesis quiz?

240
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:18,937
Got a 96.

241
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:20,772
An A-star.

242
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,399
That's great!

243
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:27,070
- It's not from the ground she licked it.
- Will you not stay for dinner, no?

244
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,364
Oh, no.
You know, I've got a stack of work on...

245
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:32,075
What is it they say?
To be a perfect guest, stay at home.

246
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,786
Mammy, we need to get this soaking.

247
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,455
Otherwise you're looking at a stain.

248
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,979
I have not had to put the bins out
in ten years.

249
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,756
- Did I say a thing? I didn't say a thing.
- No, it's just…

250
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:49,426
- Hey.
- Hey.

251
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,094
I'll see you later, chicken.

252
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:54,765
Come here. Why'd you stop dancing
when your daddy walked in?

253
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,688
He just doesn't like it
when I dance like that.

254
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:57,893
Huh? What?

255
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,729
Yeah, he says
it looks like I'm asking for it.

256
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,528
The prick's becoming an even bigger prick.

257
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,614
He put himself up for the promotion today.
My promotion.

258
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,782
He's doing it to mess with my head, but...

259
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,327
I've been thinking about
that talk we had a while back.

260
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,204
What talk?

261
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,873
Christmas. At the Forty Foot.

262
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:22,792
Yeah, I was pissed, Bibi.
You're gonna have to remind me.

263
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,294
About looking out for Grace.

264
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,475
- Oh, right, yeah.
- And killing John Paul.

265
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,300
What?

266
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:31,677
It's all I think about.

267
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,263
It's on a loop in my head.

268
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,223
What are you talking about, Bibi?

269
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,601
- We were joking!
- Well, I wasn't.

270
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,228
Well, I was!

271
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:44,356
Eva, you said so yourself.
He's sucking the life out of her.

272
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:47,526
- He's slowly killing her.
- I'm hungry. Are you a bit hungry?

273
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:51,363
Eva, we cannot just sit back
and do nothing while he drags her under.

274
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,408
God knows, she's not gonna save herself.

275
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,743
I'm not sure what I have.
I might order in though.

276
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,203
Imagine being rid of him.

277
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,999
The prick, gone from her life.
Gone from all of our lives.

278
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,395
I've been thinking of ways to do it
and not get caught,

279
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:08,630
- and it's trickier than you think.
- Trickier? What?

280
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:12,509
- Then I saw this.
- I'm not doing this with you, you mad cow!

281
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:13,886
Jesus, Bibi!

282
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:20,225
This house fire.
Three people died, but it was an accident.

283
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:23,312
An investigation found
it was caused by a gas leak.

284
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:25,147
A spark from a washing machine.

285
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,774
Please, Eva.

286
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,452
Look, I know what he did.

287
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,706
- If anyone deserves to hate him...
- This isn't revenge.

288
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,000
- I don't think even you believe that.
- It isn't.

289
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,003
We can't just kill our brother-in-law.

290
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,881
Bibi! Do I wish he was dead? Yeah.

291
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,466
He is a piece of shit.

292
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:58,096
But that is not how, you know...
That's not how life, society works.

293
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,099
Okay? You can't just explode a man.

294
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,895
It's barbaric is what it is.

295
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:07,064
And you and me, we're not…

296
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,191
Barbarians?

297
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,235
Murderers.

298
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:14,321
We're not murderers.

299
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,117
We could do it in Wicklow.

300
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:22,746
He's going there on
some stupid fucking sponsored walk soon.

301
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,374
- I saw it in Grace's calendar.
- So?

302
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:28,710
So, he will be staying at their cabin.

303
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:33,257
We play happy families one last time
at Blanaid's confirmation,

304
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,469
and then the following weekend
we blow the bloody doors off.

305
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,722
You're talking about taking a man's life.

306
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,058
Not a man.

307
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:45,769
That man.

308
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,313
That monster.

309
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,901
Give me one good reason why we shouldn't.

310
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,364
Because he's Blanaid's father.

311
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:18,385
I meant to tell ya.

312
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,637
Michael asked
if he could get a TikTok account today.

313
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,599
Right. Which means he probably
already has one. Fucking Molly.

314
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:27,477
Yeah. As long as
he doesn't rope us in to family dancing.

315
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,276
Did you take this?

316
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:36,570
- Yeah. For class.
- God, you're good, aren't you?

317
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,407
You should take one of us and the kids

318
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,827
wearing matching sweaters,
straddling a giant log.

319
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,729
You know... Just give me a minute.

320
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,164
Fuck!

321
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,418
Just... I'm just going to the toilet.

322
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:37,464
When did we start
locking the door for that?

323
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:40,175
Fuck.

324
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:48,809
Beautiful day for a confirmation, Mammy.

325
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,019
Do you want a peek at the broach?

326
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:52,354
Yes, please.

327
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,314
It's really something, isn't it?

328
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:55,941
It's a pro-life pin.

329
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,318
I'm going to give it to her now.
Is that okay?

330
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,654
Have a little
father-daughter quality time.

331
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:01,737
Of course.

332
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:03,991
I mean, she's growing up so fast.

333
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:06,410
I really feel I need to grab
all these moments while I can

334
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,412
and talk about what lies ahead.

335
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,914
I mean, sinning counts now.

336
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:12,958
She'll want to remember that.

337
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,545
I'll get rid of him.

338
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:23,302
Listen, I won't keep ya.

339
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,596
Few bob there for Blanaid for the big day.

340
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,973
- You're so kind.
- It's not a bother.

341
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,349
Horse came in, you know.

342
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:31,033
You're looking lovely by the way, Grace.

343
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,519
Isn't she?

344
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,938
Like fine wine, getting better with age.

345
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:37,858
Are you giving away money
you can't afford, Roger?

346
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,276
No. I was just saying to Grace

347
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,736
that I had a horse come in.

348
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:43,339
- Is she looking forward to the big day?
- She is, yeah.

349
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,616
Come over after for a sandwich
or a cup of tea.

350
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:48,243
- No, it's a family occasion.
- It is. Yeah.

351
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:49,870
We'll see you soon, Roger.

352
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:52,182
- Are you taking the boat out?
- I'm not taking the boat out.

353
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:54,041
- No, I'm not. Bye.
- Okay.

354
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:55,125
Jesus Christ.

355
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,628
Here, take that.

356
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:02,508
What is he thinking?

357
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:05,761
Absolutely inappropriate.

358
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:23,695
- Dad, knock.
- Why? What are you hiding?

359
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:26,323
What's that?

360
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,991
I have a little something for you.

361
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,076
Really?

362
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:30,577
For the big day.

363
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:34,248
It's all happening so fast.

364
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:38,794
It'll be your responsibility
to practice your faith now.

365
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:40,671
It won't be mum and...

366
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:45,300
What's the matter?

367
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,261
See you downstairs.

368
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,725
Why in hell are you
buying lingerie for a child?

369
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:55,018
I didn't buy anything.

370
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:56,728
She has got a bra up there.

371
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:58,915
I don't know anything about...
Wait, what? She has a bra?

372
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:00,732
Do you want her growing up
before her time?

373
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:02,901
I don't know anything about it.
I wish I did.

374
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:04,425
She must have bought it for herself.

375
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:07,573
So, since when does
a 12-year-old child go into a lingerie...

376
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:09,992
A bra is not lingerie, John Paul.

377
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,244
She is 12. It's a normal age.

378
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,080
If you're Molly,
and you've tits made of fat.

379
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:18,750
Oh, my God! Auntie Eva got it for me,
because I asked her to.

380
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,712
Because I knew you'd be freaks about it.

381
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,889
Emma Jane Catherine.

382
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,434
Be sealed with the gift
of the Holy Spirit.

383
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:37,060
Amen.

384
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:39,104
- Peace be with you.
- And with your spirit.

385
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:48,238
Blanaid Maria Bernard.

386
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:52,826
Be sealed with the gift
of the Holy Spirit.

387
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,287
- Amen.
- Peace be with you.

388
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:57,331
And with your spirit.

389
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:03,587
She looks lovely.

390
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:06,173
Hey, you.

391
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:10,260
This is nice.

392
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:15,849
What the hell is he staring at?

393
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:21,021
- Don't know.
- Prick.

394
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:24,024
Big smile. That's it, Blanaid.

395
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:28,403
Okay, everybody in. Come on, kids.
Mommy, kids, in together.

396
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,030
Come on. Go through. Squeeze.

397
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,616
Squeeze in together. Say cheese.

398
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:35,077
- Cheese.
- That's the one.

399
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,370
That's the one.

400
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:38,330
Lovely.

401
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:40,582
Here you go.

402
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,876
- Did you say cheese?
- Yes, I did.

403
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,294
That's beautiful, Urs.

404
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:45,420
It is.

405
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:47,361
- Ruben, come on.
- That's frameable.

406
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:50,259
Those after-hours lessons
are really paying off, aren't they?

407
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:53,428
- Michael, give me back my money.
- What after-hour lessons?

408
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:55,013
Dad, Michael took my money!

409
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:56,181
Coming, Michael!

410
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:57,724
- I didn't.
- You did!

411
00:25:57,808 --> 00:25:59,768
Michael, here.
Give it to me. Come over here.

412
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:02,771
Poor kid's wearing
abortion jazz hands. Did you see that?

413
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,107
I don't know how you work with him.

414
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,733
I would have marched into HR years ago

415
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:10,612
and told them what a racist, homophobic,
sadistic, bigoted son of a prick he is.

416
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:12,281
Get rid of him.

417
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:14,157
That's one way.

418
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:22,749
Nora, can you give me one of those?

419
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,084
- Please.
- It's for you.

420
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:26,128
And it's just from me. Okay?

421
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:29,464
Not from them. Not from those aunties.

422
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:30,632
Just from this auntie.

423
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:35,262
Very proud of you today.

424
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:41,226
Fifty euro. That's very generous.

425
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:45,689
Perhaps she can spend it on
lace stockings to go with the lingerie.

426
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:47,917
- What are you talking about?
- John Paul.

427
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:50,569
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.
- Oh, my God.

428
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:51,987
Is this about the bra?

429
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,798
So you're not content
with your younger sister

430
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:55,073
having a reputation about town.

431
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:57,438
You also need to groom
your 12-year-old niece, is that it?

432
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:58,928
Can you control your husband, Grace?

433
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:00,930
I just don't understand
why you didn't ask me, Eva.

434
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:03,123
Because Blanaid spoke to me about...

435
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:04,893
I would have liked
to have done that with her.

436
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:07,002
- I never had that moment with my own mam.
- Grace...

437
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:08,462
And now you've taken it from me.

438
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:11,566
She was worried that you
would speak to John Paul.

439
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,966
You would've get his permission...

440
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,110
- I wouldn't have...
- There's nothing there anyway,

441
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:15,636
two bloody moles worth.

442
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:17,346
Dad.

443
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:21,433
Blanaid. Now look what you've done.

444
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:24,811
Don't you dare turn this on me.

445
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:26,831
She doesn't come to you,
because she doesn't respect you.

446
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:29,816
And she doesn't respect you,
because you're weak.

447
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:35,656
If you want to sexualize a child,
have one of your own.

448
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:40,744
I forgot. You can't.

449
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:45,707
Now what's gonna happen?
You're gonna hit me? Are you?

450
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:50,504
Frigid bitch.

451
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:00,097
Fuck.

452
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:45,559
Does this mean you're in?
We're doing the right thing, okay?

453
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:48,478
For Grace. And for Blanaid.

454
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:18,175
You all right?

455
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,933
It wasn't fair of Grace to say

456
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:28,977
that… you took
that moment from her, with Mam.

457
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:32,606
She missed it because her boobs
took too long to come in.

458
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:38,153
I had bloody C cups at 12,
and I had no mammy there with me.

459
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:40,197
But you did great.

460
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:43,801
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

461
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:44,826
Yeah.

462
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:49,599
Did Grace say what day JP
would coming up here?

463
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:54,211
No, but his walking thing's on Saturday,
so maybe, like, Friday?

464
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:56,338
So long as he doesn't see Sunday.

465
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:25,075
I figure we need 50 seconds
to clear the cabin?

466
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:29,621
So the fuse must be about
three meters away.

467
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:30,706
Right.

468
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:33,041
We're gonna have to assume
there's no windows open

469
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,765
or it'll act as a vector if there's wind.

470
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:40,883
- Hell is a vector?
- Okay, so to the fireplace is…

471
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:44,052
I don't know if this tape

472
00:30:44,136 --> 00:30:46,638
is going to be long enough.
Bloody thing keeps getting twisted.

473
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,851
Nine meters.

474
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:53,520
Okay. Write down nine meters.

475
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:56,690
Eva.

476
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:59,443
- Huh? Oh, yeah. Sorry.
- Nine meters.

477
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:05,824
I remember smoking up
that chimney with Ciaran?

478
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:07,951
When you were all asleep.

479
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,661
That was a long time ago.

480
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:12,915
- Yeah. It's ten years.
- Exactly.

481
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:16,752
The fireplace is too far.
Help me find another trigger.

482
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:20,756
What are you doing?

483
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:23,342
- What are you doing?
- What? I thought you gave that up?

484
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:24,760
Yeah, I had.

485
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:27,888
I told you coming up here
was bad for my health.

486
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:35,521
Everything happens for a reason.

487
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:39,441
Some patronizing fucker once said.

488
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:45,447
Well, don't…

489
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:48,992
Help me find another ignition point, Eva.

490
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:52,120
Otherwise,
all this will have been for nothing.

491
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,458
Look.

492
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:02,631
Yeah, I didn't see that.

493
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:04,758
Open your eyes.

494
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:06,426
Eye.

495
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:08,762
Come on.

496
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,812
Hold this. Hold it tight, yeah?

497
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:19,189
- You got it?
- Yeah.

498
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:25,445
Yep. That'll work.

499
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:27,948
- Most important thing.
- What?

500
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:30,450
Grace and Blanaid aren't with him.

501
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:38,625
It's an early birthday present
and Christmas present.

502
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:41,879
Oh, no. I can't.

503
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:44,256
What? Why?
You can tell Blanaid it was your idea.

504
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:46,216
- She'll love you for that.
- I don't know.

505
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:48,695
Look, I feel terrible
about what happened...

506
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:49,970
Me too.

507
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:52,907
And it was never about me trying
to take something from you...

508
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:54,868
Is it okay if we don't talk about it?
Is that okay?

509
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:56,101
Of course.

510
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:00,272
But for me.

511
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:03,192
That could be my "sorry."

512
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:10,175
- John Paul would never allow...
- John Paul doesn't need to know, does he?

513
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:12,284
He said he was in Wicklow anyway.
Just en...

514
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:14,745
Enjoy a night with your daughter.

515
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:17,623
I can't get her to talk to me, Eva.

516
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,750
It's like I...

517
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,752
I don't know how to give her what sh...

518
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:23,212
What she wants or…

519
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:26,590
…or even what she needs.

520
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:34,264
- John Paul is right. I'm failing.
- J... Grace.

521
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:35,628
No, it will be fine. It will be.

522
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:37,768
I just need to toughen up and wait it out.

523
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:43,482
Things will get better.
I promise.

524
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,196
I determined the cause
of Mr. Williams's death myself.

525
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,533
Quite frankly, I'm offended
that you're doubting my conclusion.

526
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:55,296
I think the real offense here is
that there was no forensic autopsy.

527
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:58,705
- As a matter of principle...
- He had a blood-alcohol level of 1.6%.

528
00:33:58,789 --> 00:33:59,831
Case closed.

529
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:02,668
Mr. Williams was also
a self-professed teetotaler.

530
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:06,630
So, 1.6% could demand a second look.

531
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,134
- For Christ's sake.
- I'm sorry.

532
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,219
Is that her again?

533
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:13,887
- Yeah. I'll just...
- Yeah.

534
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,950
- Why don't you just silence the thing?
- I'm gonna silence it now.

535
00:34:16,974 --> 00:34:18,076
- Turn it off.
- I've turned it off.

536
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,976
Stop wasting my time.

537
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,771
You're not investigators,
you're insurance men.

538
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:26,733
- Come on.
- Please, Doctor. We're desperate here.

539
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:30,612
I knew your dad. Ol' Laughin' Claffin.

540
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:33,215
Used to play darts
with him up at the Gravediggers.

541
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,409
Yeah? Well, I mean do it for him then.

542
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,496
What? Didn't know him that well.
Just played darts with him.

543
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:44,918
You need an inspector to agree to it.
So take it up with the police.

544
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:49,339
And you'll need the widow's permission.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

545
00:34:50,174 --> 00:34:51,175
Oh, God.

546
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:57,014
I'm telling you,

547
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:59,683
apart from that lady solicitor
he was clearly banging,

548
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:01,894
Dad knew some real dickheads.

549
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:04,354
So what now, Thomas?

550
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:07,263
You know that widow's never
gonna give us her signature.

551
00:35:07,316 --> 00:35:08,984
She's just put him in the ground.

552
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:11,695
What now? We change our modus operandi.

553
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:23,566
Well, with any luck, this will be
the last time you see us.

554
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:25,918
- May I?
- Oh, yeah.

555
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:30,506
So we met with your sister earlier. Eva.

556
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:32,132
- You did?
- Lovely woman.

557
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:35,594
Bit of a sneery head on her, but good fun.

558
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,014
Little difficult. But listen,
that's only if I'm picking out...

559
00:35:39,097 --> 00:35:41,975
She mentioned that
she and your husband didn't always get on.

560
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:44,061
- She said that?
- Yeah, she did.

561
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:45,562
I have the exact quote.

562
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,359
Or I could play it for you.

563
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:51,961
- No, really, I don't need…
- Good, yeah.

564
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:54,505
- Not sure I could find it.
- Apologies if that was news to you.

565
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,948
No, it's just...

566
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:58,742
She doesn't seem to be mourning his loss.
Let's just say that.

567
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:01,370
Well, you know, families,
they have their differences.

568
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:04,706
I'm sorry, what are you suggesting?

569
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,500
No, I'm not suggesting anything.

570
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:12,756
But if I was suggesting something,
we do have to look at it from every angle.

571
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,509
- Ask the questions.
- Have you actually asked a question?

572
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:18,220
Well, I'm gonna ask you one right now.

573
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:22,808
Is it a possibility that Eva
may have wanted to harm your husband?

574
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:27,437
Well, you seem upset.

575
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:31,942
When my parents died,
Eva gave up everything to take care of us.

576
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:33,735
Took on all the responsibility.

577
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:37,072
She'd never do anything to hurt me.

578
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:39,533
Of course she wouldn't.

579
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:43,346
Anyway, we just have a few papers to sign,
and then we'll be on our way.

580
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,372
Just crossing T's and dotting I's.

581
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:49,501
And we do have some good news.

582
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:52,629
- Your sister did corroborate your alibi...
- Alibi?

583
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:55,799
Did I say alibi? Whereabouts.

584
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:56,923
Sorry, just initial there.

585
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,013
Just a shame it didn't come
from somebody unbiased.

586
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:02,598
I mean... Right there.

587
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:04,761
I mean, the number of times
I've lied for my brother.

588
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:07,126
And right down there at the bottom.

589
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:12,149
And that's it.

590
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:15,319
And again, Mrs. Williams,
we're so sorry for your loss.

591
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:26,830
- What is going on, Tom?
- Hey!

592
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:29,809
- Look what you did.
- This isn't you, all right?

593
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:32,187
You don't do this kind of thing.
You tricked a widow into signing...

594
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:34,439
All right, come on.
It wasn't like it was sleight of hand.

595
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:35,464
Even Dad had limits.

596
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:38,342
Really, yeah?
Well, lying is a form of deception too.

597
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:39,551
What does that mean?

598
00:37:40,636 --> 00:37:41,762
Forget it, okay?

599
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:44,806
Just trust that I know what I'm doing.

600
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,976
Now look, we get a postmortem,
there's nothing there, we let it go.

601
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:52,523
But I will bet on my unborn child's life
that these sisters are at the heart of it.

602
00:37:54,483 --> 00:37:55,484
I don't know.

603
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:59,196
- Have I ever been wrong before?
- Yeah.

604
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,090
That time you swore everyone
would sing along with me

605
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:02,908
- to "Patricia the Stripper."
- Now, come on.

606
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:05,671
And that time you said I wouldn't choke
if put 20 Polos in my mouth.

607
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:07,913
I'm buying you a drink.

608
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:27,599
Well, look at you from out of nowhere.

609
00:38:27,683 --> 00:38:29,268
Where the hell have you been?

610
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:34,940
Okay, great.

611
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:38,735
I'll meet you in 15?

612
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:46,702
Yeah, so it took me a while
to get over her,

613
00:38:46,785 --> 00:38:50,664
especially as I was still raw
from the breakup with you, you know?

614
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:53,041
I mean, I'm not really fully over her.

615
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:54,960
Or you.

616
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,633
Did I tell you she punctured
my left testicle?

617
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:05,095
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

618
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:06,430
She sounds nuts.

619
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:08,765
Why'd she do that?

620
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:10,684
I told her about you.

621
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:14,146
Is it okay to off-load like this?

622
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:16,064
You know, I just think, open up the attic,

623
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:17,482
let the bats fly free, you know?

624
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:18,942
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

625
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:20,986
I'm gonna get us another pint.

626
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:24,198
Why don't you get us a table out back?

627
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:25,908
- Yeah.
- I think I might start smoking.

628
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:27,367
Yeah.

629
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:33,332
Can I get two more pints, please?

630
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:36,710
Handful of those cocktail sticks,
so I can poke my eyes out.

631
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:39,087
Fucking hell.

632
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:41,675
I have a mate whose brother works
for the Guards.

633
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,693
So, if he can put me through
to the inspector...

634
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:46,094
Yeah, just keep your dignity
this time is all I ask.

635
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:48,305
Or at least try.

636
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:56,855
Give me a minute.

637
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:02,361
Hey. What's up?

638
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:06,031
Sorry, someone who
doesn't want me to feel shit

639
00:40:06,114 --> 00:40:08,283
about myself is finally calling me back.

640
00:40:09,368 --> 00:40:10,827
Matt, is that you?

641
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:12,621
Oh, no, you're right here.

642
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:15,832
- Sorry, I've been working, like...
- All day?

643
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:18,001
Who needs to hear that much bass?

644
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:21,046
No, my day job.
I was gonna call you. I just didn't…

645
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:22,631
Well, now you don't have to.

646
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:25,759
I hope you score with your date.

647
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:27,928
- Oh, no. That's my brother.
- Sure.

648
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:29,596
No, we have different mothers.

649
00:40:39,857 --> 00:40:41,567
These are from that lad over there.

650
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:44,444
Make sure you give him a nice "thank you."

651
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:06,508
Hello?

652
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:07,968
Hey, how are you? It's Matt.

653
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:09,887
That wasn't so hard, was it?

654
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:13,473
You said something about getting dinner?

655
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:17,269
Yeah, I know what I said,
but what do you have to say?

656
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:21,231
I say maybe let's get a Chinese sometime?

657
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:24,484
Well, we only have
one Chinese restaurant in town,

658
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:26,278
and I'm banned from it, so…

659
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,281
How do you get banned
from a Chinese restaurant?

660
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:31,450
Break up with the owner?

661
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:33,952
Oh, right.

662
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:36,830
Well, I really fancy Chinese,

663
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:40,667
so if you two could get back together,
maybe that would be quite convenient.

664
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:43,962
What are you up to anyway?

665
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:46,924
I'm just talking to you.

666
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,085
You're early.

667
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:27,923
Yeah, well. Early bird.

668
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:31,718
Can we stop for sandwiches?

669
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:47,943
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- Do you wanna drive?

670
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:54,408
It's just nerves. Okay?

671
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,493
Let's try this again.

672
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:23,770
Need a hand?

673
00:43:23,854 --> 00:43:26,315
- No, I'll manage. Would you stop...
- All right.

674
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:28,901
Come on, John Paul. Hurry up.

675
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:33,864
Will you wait for me please?

676
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:49,922
Christ!

677
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:31,547
If the box is empty, Grace,
throw the damn thing away.

678
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,590
I've said it a hundred times.

679
00:44:38,136 --> 00:44:39,513
Oh, for Christ's sake.

680
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:43,976
What on earth?

681
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:10,961
This is unbelievable. How did you...

682
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:14,882
Mam.

683
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,135
Mam!

684
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:20,846
No, you're right. I won't do that.
Yeah, come on.

685
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:41,074
Oh, Mam, please don't.
She's about to start. Please.

686
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:43,952
Hey, love. Everything okay?

687
00:45:44,036 --> 00:45:45,704
Mammy, my feet are so blistered,

688
00:45:45,787 --> 00:45:48,165
all my skin came off in my socks.

689
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:51,168
And I've been tearing
the place apart for plasters.

690
00:45:53,045 --> 00:45:54,129
Where the hell are you?

691
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:56,840
We're... Look, this is...

692
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:58,485
I promise it's nothing
to be concerned about.

693
00:45:58,509 --> 00:46:00,260
I just had this crazy idea.

694
00:46:00,344 --> 00:46:01,553
Where are you?

695
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:07,476
B and I got tickets
to a Lizzo concert in Dublin.

696
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:10,395
Are you kidding?

697
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:14,399
No. They're a gift from Eva.

698
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,739
We'll talk about it when I get home,
Grace.

699
00:46:20,822 --> 00:46:24,368
Good evening, Dublin!

700
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:26,286
Blanaid?

701
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:31,083
Bloody Garveys.

702
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:49,685
I'm hungry. You?

703
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:52,521
No.

704
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:39,443
Been an hour since the lights went out.

705
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:40,986
He's gotta be asleep by now.

706
00:47:44,281 --> 00:47:45,282
Okay.

707
00:48:05,177 --> 00:48:07,221
Are you gonna join me, or just sit there?

708
00:48:08,472 --> 00:48:09,723
I think maybe the latter.

709
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:12,202
Which one's the latter?
I always get those confused.

710
00:48:12,226 --> 00:48:14,228
I can't do it, Bibi. I can't do it.

711
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:17,564
- Eva, you said you were fine.
- How do I know if I'm fine or not?

712
00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:22,152
I mean, look at us!
What are we even doing here?

713
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:24,154
You know the answer to that question.

714
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:28,408
All right then. Just gonna do it alone.

715
00:48:38,544 --> 00:48:40,462
Are you actually
gonna let me do this on my own?

716
00:48:40,546 --> 00:48:43,006
I don't want you to do this at all.

717
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:18,250
Frigid bitch.

718
00:49:20,544 --> 00:49:22,129
Come on.

719
00:49:36,643 --> 00:49:38,812
- Jesus Christ!
- Fuck!

720
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:41,270
What's taking you so long?

721
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:43,859
What's taking me so long?
Are you bored out there?

722
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:45,569
I was worried about you.

723
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:47,863
The matches won't light.
Give me your lighter.

724
00:49:47,946 --> 00:49:49,907
- What?
- Your cigarettes.

725
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:52,618
- I threw them away.
- Why would you do that?

726
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:54,536
Will you just calm down?

727
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:11,512
Wait.

728
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:22,731
No, wait. Wait.

729
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,151
I need to finish this.

730
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:38,497
Go!

731
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:03,021
Shit, your phone. Turn it off!

732
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:06,191
Why's he calling me?

733
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:32,384
- What the actual fuck?
- What?

734
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:33,886
Oh, my God. He's over there!

735
00:51:33,969 --> 00:51:36,763
- Why?
- He's over there! Fuck!

736
00:51:36,847 --> 00:51:41,935
No!

737
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:48,901
No!
