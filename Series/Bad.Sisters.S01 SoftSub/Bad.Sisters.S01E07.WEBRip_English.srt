1
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,030
- Oh, no.
- Oh, come on.

2
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,662
Is there someone else in that boat?

3
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,915
Oh, shit.

4
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,627
That isn't your man from work, is it?

5
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,710
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- There's someone in the water.

6
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,941
- Call an ambulance. Quick!
- Are you fucking kidding me?

7
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:48,966
Oh, Gabriel.

8
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,846
What is he doing?

9
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,472
Trying to save a man's life.

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,975
JP?

11
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,691
Paramedics are seven minutes away.

12
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,864
Fuck's sake.

13
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:14,283
- Oh, no. Is he breathing?
- I don't think so.

14
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,368
Oh, he has no trousers on.

15
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,412
That's not a big priority, David.

16
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,085
Eva.

17
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,525
- Eva, we need to get out...
- Just wait, wait, wait.

18
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,885
Come on, you stubborn bastard.

19
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,098
- Oh, my God.
- Eva, we need to get out of here.

20
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,933
Okay, okay.

21
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,727
- Hey.
- Fuck's sake.

22
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,901
Hey, you.

23
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,198
Wha... Wha... Um…

24
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,534
Are you in pain?

25
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,079
John Paul. How are you feeling?

26
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,082
Like I should be dead.

27
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,458
Well, luckily you're not.

28
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,379
But can you tell me anything
you remember from last night?

29
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,632
From...

30
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,801
How you got from your home to the marina?

31
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:39,928
Marin...

32
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,515
That's where the paramedics were called.

33
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,809
You don't remember anything?

34
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:47,853
Mmm. No.

35
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,565
That sometimes happens
when going through a traumatic experience.

36
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,153
Are you under any extra stress
at the moment?

37
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,906
Have you been feeling depressed?

38
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,368
I'm not suicidal. If... If...

39
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:07,039
Maybe you could speak to him
after he's rested some more?

40
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,419
What if he saw us in the bedroom?

41
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:17,007
Well, that... that would mean the police
could be on their way here right now.

42
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,635
The police would already be here
if he saw us.

43
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,181
You said Rohypnol causes blackouts, right?

44
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,641
We'll be fine.

45
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,684
What if he gets his memory back?

46
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,146
- Could that happen?
- Yeah.

47
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,318
This is all your gay boyfriend's fault.

48
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:40,197
Oh, yeah. What a wanker.
Saved a drowning man's life.

49
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,369
Do you have something
more important to do?

50
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,620
I have to go to work.

51
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,334
It's Grace.

52
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,383
Hey, honey, we're... we're...
We're all here at Ursula's.

53
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,511
Hey. He's okay. Physically, he's okay.

54
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,972
But mentally, he's wrecked.

55
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:09,977
He said... He thinks... He thi... He thinks…

56
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,397
He thinks someone's trying to kill him.

57
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,274
- Oh.
- Shit.

58
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,441
That's insane.

59
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,735
How? Why?

60
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,154
Did he... Did he, um... Did he see anything?

61
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:29,204
Gra... Grace,
just t-take... take a breath and...

62
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,665
He says it's the only explanation, is...

63
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,668
Someone drugged him
and threw him into the marina

64
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,753
- and left him for dead.
- Ah, shit.

65
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,882
Where's the nasal spray?

66
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,176
I-I-I... Y-Y-You... Y...

67
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,096
Oh, well, um... Did... Did... Did he say who?

68
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,348
What are you talking about? Nobody.

69
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,018
He must've banged his head
falling into the water.

70
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,146
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

71
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,316
- That's... Yeah. And look, Blanaid is fine.
- I can't find it.

72
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,159
She's here with us,
so don't worry about her.

73
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,445
- Thank you.
- And don't worry about him either.

74
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,448
You know, he'll be fine.
Jesus, the stress he puts you under.

75
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,909
- It never fucking ends!
- Call us... Um... Um...

76
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,786
Grace, if you need anything
you just call us, okay?

77
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,831
We're here for you. Okay. Love you.

78
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,922
I love you too.

79
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,305
No one is gonna believe him, okay?

80
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,351
If he says any of that crap.
They're gonna think he's lost the plot.

81
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,479
We can't find the nasal spray.

82
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,860
Well, you've gotta sort that out.

83
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,947
- I mean, this is your responsibility.
- Since when?

84
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,949
You bring the drugs in. You take them out.

85
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,909
- I gave it to you.
- No, you didn't.

86
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:49,993
Didn't I?

87
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,623
Oh. Then it must be at the house.

88
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,293
Well, I can't...
I've got a job interview, okay? I...

89
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,005
I have one eye.

90
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,885
Fine. I'll take Blanaid back.

91
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,096
I'll grab the damn thing
and get rid, okay?

92
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:18,814
Oh, shit. Bloody…

93
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,945
Those messages you left last night.

94
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,906
"Who knows what I'll do."
That's what you said.

95
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,284
But that was about the netball tournament.

96
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,327
I-I didn't want you to go.

97
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,305
Oh, so you jump into the sea
in the middle of the night?

98
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,331
Can you see how that terrifies me?

99
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:39,543
Grace, can we please talk about this
at home?

100
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,712
Please. I just want to go home.

101
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,256
I do... I don't know, John Paul.

102
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,550
Please, Gracie.

103
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,095
Please.

104
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:53,849
Okay.

105
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:57,787
But we have to make an appointment
with the psychologist before we leave.

106
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,189
All right. Okay. Thank you.

107
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,524
Blanaid's at Ursula's,

108
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:05,527
so we'll have the place to ourselves,
so we can really talk.

109
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,738
Okay.

110
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,992
Did... Did you, um...
Did you bring me some clothes?

111
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,994
- Yeah.
- Oh.

112
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,542
Excuse me.

113
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,047
What?

114
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,852
They had the sleeping pills,
but unfortunate...

115
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,438
Wha... What are you doing?

116
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:42,856
I'm going to my interview.

117
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,109
No.
Gerald will understand if you postpone.

118
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,111
I'm not postponing. I'll look bad.

119
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,031
That's the last thing I want,
but... Just say you're sick.

120
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:55,077
Jesus Christ. I can't say I'm sick
'cause I'm not sick.

121
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,787
Someone tried to kill me.

122
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,581
You're distressed. You're upset.

123
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:03,877
Mammy, I'll be much more distressed
and upset if I don't get this promotion.

124
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,922
This is for us. For our family.
It's for our future.

125
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,675
And I deserve it.

126
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,969
You're not thinking straight!

127
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,139
You need some time off.
You need to slow down.

128
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,391
I'll see you back home.

129
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:20,686
John Paul.

130
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,325
- I have to go. I have to go.
- No.

131
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,203
No, don't go. Come on.

132
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,333
I can't be late today.

133
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,544
Why? You got more innocent families
to stitch up?

134
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:48,589
Sorry.

135
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,674
It's my dad's birthday.

136
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,677
Well, it would've been.

137
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,389
I'm meeting Thomas at the grave.

138
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,811
Come here.

139
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,567
Ow. Christ.

140
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,111
- You looking for my soft tissue?
- Sorry.

141
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:12,196
Years of shiatsu.

142
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,699
My grip's stronger than I think.

143
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:26,001
It seems weird to me, marking his birthday
now that I know what actually happened.

144
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:30,255
Well, you're celebrating his life,
not his death.

145
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:31,965
Mmm.

146
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,761
We could do something later.

147
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,805
Something a little bit less depressing
than a cemetery trip.

148
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,307
Like what?

149
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,396
Where would you wanna be
if you could be anywhere in the world?

150
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,565
In Tijuana.

151
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,818
"In your arms, Becka"
was the right answer.

152
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:54,571
In your arms in Tijuana, Becka.

153
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,907
How about in your arms in Casablanca's

154
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,826
'cause that's on Dolman Street,
and we get there in a cab for a fiver.

155
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:03,914
I'd be as happy in your arms
in your flat with a curry.

156
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:04,998
Deal.

157
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,462
Bye.

158
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,339
- Matt.
- Yeah?

159
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,509
Your brother lost his dad too.

160
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,077
Don't know how he ever drank that stuff.

161
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,663
Straight from the can, I think.

162
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,499
Thought you might not come.

163
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,293
Yeah, well…

164
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,342
Theresa went the whole night
without kicking me.

165
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,071
It's usually like sharing a bed
with an Ultimate Fighting champion...

166
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,389
I still don't understand
why you didn't tell me, Tom.

167
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:09,646
At the time, I didn't consider
an alternative to not telling you.

168
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,982
I thought if you knew,
you'd be complicit too.

169
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,275
Dad didn't want that.

170
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,236
But I'm sorry.

171
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,034
Here. Go on.

172
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:51,230
You ever wondered if
you could've done something to stop him?

173
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,690
Me?

174
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,194
Well, you worked with him,
grew up with him…

175
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:02,157
Pretty sure I didn't imagine you farting
in the bottom bunker every other weekend.

176
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,079
Exactly. Every other weekend.

177
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,665
Sometimes less is more.

178
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:13,418
You get half the grief, half the hassle,
half the picking up the pieces.

179
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,047
I feel like you're angry
that he was kind to me.

180
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,465
I'm fucking fuming.

181
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:23,136
I didn't even know you existed
till the bunk bed showed up in me room.

182
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,099
This, you, the business…

183
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:29,601
Him all over.

184
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,523
Someone else left to deal with the fallout
from his mistakes.

185
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:38,193
Except this time I'm helping, aren't I?

186
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:43,782
I'm gonna let
you calling me a mistake slide.

187
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,165
He asked to always make sure
you were okay.

188
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:58,213
Do you think he knew he was going to
kill himself when he said that?

189
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:01,466
It was two days before,
so I think so, yeah.

190
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,388
I know I couldn't have done anything
to stop him,

191
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,932
but I will always make sure
that you're okay, Matt.

192
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,194
You wanna come to the flat?

193
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:23,030
Yeah.

194
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,114
Great.

195
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:27,034
The Wi-Fi's down. Theresa's raising hell.

196
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:30,913
What was that message you left
about Mr. Williams?

197
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:34,458
Oh. I have proof that
he thought someone was trying to kill him.

198
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,793
The Williams fella told the psychologist

199
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,272
that he thought someone drugged him
and pushed him into the water.

200
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,756
She needed something to do.

201
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,859
If you're saying
that someone was one of these sisters...

202
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,427
No, we're not...
We're still investigating.

203
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:49,306
Is that what you were doing yesterday?
Investigating the Garvey girl?

204
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,684
Family first,
little Matt second, remember?

205
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,811
Come on. He's got his priorities straight.

206
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:58,190
Mmm. My money's on the sister he maimed.

207
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:01,818
If some lanky Swedish dickhead took
one of my eyes, I'd want him dead too.

208
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,571
It doesn't matter which one it was.
The widow's the beneficiary.

209
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:06,883
She's the one we have to prove
knew what they were up to.

210
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,493
What did the guy
who fished JP out of the water say?

211
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:13,956
- He's next on the list. Yeah.
- Mmm.

212
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:18,168
This is what happens when you deny a woman
her Internet connection.

213
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:31,390
I'm sorry. I have no milk. Cream?

214
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,809
What? No, no.
Jesus. No, no. That would've...

215
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,519
That'd be horrible.

216
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:36,937
We won't keep you.

217
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,998
We wondered if you could
run us through what happened

218
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,774
the night Mr. Williams nearly drowned?

219
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,655
You're insurance investigators, right?

220
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:50,325
So what, you're trying
to stop JP's widow getting her payout?

221
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,509
We're trying to establish what happened,

222
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:55,080
which means looking into
all the events leading up to his death.

223
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:59,251
I can only tell you what happened after
he got to the marina, nothing before.

224
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:03,422
- Did you see how he entered the water?
- No. But he was on his boat, I think.

225
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,008
Do you think there's a chance
somebody pushed him?

226
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,259
He said he slipped.

227
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:15,017
You worked with both Mr. Williams
and Eva Garvey.

228
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,935
How would you describe their relationship?

229
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:18,896
Have you spoken to her?

230
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,480
Why?

231
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:24,651
Well, she asked me not to tell JP,
but she was there that night.

232
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,949
Did Eva say why she was at the marina?

233
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,619
She said they were there to see me.

234
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,288
Apparently, she saw I was with someone,
so they left.

235
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:40,417
- You didn't believe her?
- Who knows with her and JP?

236
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,128
I thought she just plain hated him,
but then…

237
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,466
It was strange, intense, you know?

238
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:52,804
Are you still in contact with Eva?

239
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:53,889
Mm-mmm.

240
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,308
Can I ask what happened?

241
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,310
No.

242
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,438
We'll get out of your hair.

243
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:10,113
Y-You just said after she saw
you were with someone, they left.

244
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,198
Mm-hmm.

245
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,866
Not, "She left"?

246
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,327
Yeah. Uh, Eva was not alone.

247
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:19,455
Her little sister was in the car.
Uh, Becka.

248
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,255
Okay. Thank you very much.

249
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,173
Thanks.

250
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,803
Not only was Eva Garvey there that night,

251
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,055
she lied about it
and asked him to lie about it.

252
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,058
This is enough
to get Loftus to exhume the body...

253
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:40,060
- Can we just stop and think for a second?
- And I'm just gonna say this.

254
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:44,857
I think Becka targeted you to distract you
from whatever her family did to Williams.

255
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,442
- What?
- Why else were they there that night?

256
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,281
You're not even arguing with me.

257
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:54,404
No, 'cause you won't give me a second
to think, Tom.

258
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,830
- She had clear financial motive.
- Oh, shit.

259
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,291
You've been seeing her again, haven't you?

260
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,228
Hey, you best tell me now
before the shit really hits the fan.

261
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,253
Matt, please.

262
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:10,174
Just think about what we have to lose,
how much we've already lost.

263
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,762
I found a check at her apartment.
It was hidden.

264
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:16,847
What check?

265
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,932
It was from JP's mother to Becka
for eight grand.

266
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,494
If anything, it proves she's done nothing.

267
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,871
- How?
- Because she didn't cash it.

268
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:24,104
Yeah, because she couldn't.

269
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:27,441
I got Dad's pal at the bank
to check all of the Williams' accounts.

270
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,526
The old lady's was practically empty.

271
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,362
She probably gained her trust
to wheedle thousands out of her.

272
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:35,449
When that failed, she turned
to that sucker's life insurance.

273
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:37,534
Tell me you've got it, the check.

274
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,077
- No.
- Ah, f... Goddamn.

275
00:18:58,055 --> 00:18:59,056
Yes!

276
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,808
Matt. Matt.

277
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:03,810
You've done the right thing.

278
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:06,104
Let's get that body up.

279
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:16,865
Okay.

280
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,384
- That went really well though.
- Oh.

281
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,136
And you know
I have other people to see, but...

282
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,496
- Yeah. But I'm through to judges' houses?
- Oh, yeah.

283
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:23,997
Well done.

284
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:25,082
Okay.

285
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:27,876
Sounds like you nailed it.

286
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,712
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

287
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:33,465
Hey, hey, hey. It's fine. It's fine.
You've got this.

288
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:34,967
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

289
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:39,513
I bloody hope so
because I have no plan B.

290
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:45,227
That job was yours even before John Paul
decided to go for a swim with no pants.

291
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,521
Now he's got no chance.

292
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,648
How is he?

293
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,067
- Oh, he's fine. Yeah. He's fine.
- Yeah?

294
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,319
I still don't understand what happened.

295
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:56,196
I know.

296
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,574
Do you have no idea?

297
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:00,217
Well, no. I mean, only what Grace said.

298
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:04,788
You know, and, uh... and you,
the hero of the hour, saving his life.

299
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,499
Yeah, well, you could've helped.

300
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,669
You know, it was like dragging a statue
through a swamp.

301
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,922
- How do you mean?
- Well, I would've waved to you,

302
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:16,133
but my hands
were full with your brother-in-law.

303
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:21,305
I thought it might be some
weird family baptism or so...

304
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,891
Till you fled the scene.

305
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:29,188
Well, I mean, as a... as a matter of fact,

306
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:31,982
I was, um, I was there to see you.

307
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,985
You know,
'cause I-I wanted a... a drinking partner,

308
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,779
and then I saw your... your hot shipmate,

309
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,574
so I left
before you forced me into a threesome.

310
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:42,701
Right.

311
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:48,415
But, um, can you keep it to yourself
that... that... that I was there?

312
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,502
Just because if... if JP finds out,
you know, he'll be...

313
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,713
He'll freak out that I saw him
in that kind of state, you know?

314
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,882
Eyes rolling, balls out.

315
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,592
Yeah. Exactly.

316
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,469
So just keep it to yourself?

317
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,304
- Okay.
- Okay.

318
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:06,225
Oh, shit.

319
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,323
Can I h-have a word?

320
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,575
Yeah. Of course.

321
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,704
I-I should, um, thank you.

322
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,874
- Yeah, it's fine. It's okay. Are you okay?
- Um…

323
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,920
Y-Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I'm... I mean, um…

324
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,841
I-I must've tripped.

325
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,051
I banged my head, I think. Um...

326
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,262
- You were in a state. Yeah.
- Mmm.

327
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:44,763
Yeah. And…

328
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:48,392
You haven't said anything
to anybody, have you?

329
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:51,478
- It's none of my business.
- Mm-hmm.

330
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:56,942
And did you, um... did you see anything?

331
00:21:58,277 --> 00:21:59,486
JP.

332
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:02,114
Good luck.

333
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:04,658
- Hmm?
- Apparently, Eva smashed it in there.

334
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,760
- Can I watch TV?
- Course.

335
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:26,138
I'm watching this thing
about a Korean girl

336
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:29,600
who kills her boyfriend after she
finds out that he slept with her brother.

337
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:31,310
Have you seen it?

338
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:32,936
Girl, I wrote it.

339
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,831
You sort that. I'll get the snacks.
Sound good?

340
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:35,856
Yeah.

341
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,908
Well, as I see it,
we need to diversify

342
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:48,327
to ensure a stable flow of income
and growth.

343
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:53,624
- Well, you've clearly done your homework.
- Yes… …and everybody else's.

344
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:56,126
Indeed.

345
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,253
It's a bit indiscreet of me, but, uh,

346
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:02,216
have to say I'm more than happy with yours
and Eva's performances in interview.

347
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:04,718
It's really very impressive.

348
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,471
Mm-hmm. Good. Good.

349
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,181
And you're family.

350
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,266
So, it's a win-win, isn't it?

351
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,351
It is. Yeah, well.

352
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,895
Whoever gets the job,
it keeps it in the family.

353
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:18,148
Exactly. And, I mean,
she is an amazing woman,

354
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:20,609
and that isn't just family loyalty.

355
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,736
She... She never ceases to inspire me.

356
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:26,573
Um, everything she's been through,
all she's overcome, and...

357
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:28,116
Uh, the death of her parents?

358
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,747
Yes, that and, um... her... her breakdown.

359
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,291
The... The sabbatical she took.

360
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:40,712
Everybody knows that she likes a drink,
but back then it was…

361
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:43,966
But she seems to be in control of it.

362
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:47,010
That's not easy.
My mother struggled for years.

363
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:51,932
Yeah, well, I mean, if that is something
you can actually ever have under control,

364
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:54,393
um, you probably know better than I do.

365
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,270
Unfortunately.

366
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,024
I'm sure she's fine.

367
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,904
Uh, grand.

368
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,096
Perfect.

369
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:39,271
Filthy bastard.

370
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:42,482
Ugh. Ew.

371
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:39,164
- What are you doing in here?
- I was just tidying up.

372
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:41,667
I figured Grace had enough
on her plate, so…

373
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:45,838
All done. How are you doing?

374
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:48,882
You look great.

375
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:52,594
Did you just put something in your pocket?

376
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:55,013
- I asked you what's in your pocket.
- Nothing.

377
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:56,974
- Well, you're hiding something.
- I'm not.

378
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:58,350
What the hell did you take?

379
00:25:58,433 --> 00:25:59,726
- Give it back here.
- I...

380
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,936
- Give it to me!
- Get off!

381
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,354
Dad!

382
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:10,445
I'm okay.
Ah, your dad's just a bit stressed.

383
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,156
You need anything, you call me, okay?

384
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,372
Fuck.

385
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,922
- I'm sorry.
- Why did you do that?

386
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:31,175
She's only helping.

387
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:32,759
- Rubbish.
- What?

388
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:38,223
Look… sweetheart.

389
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:42,019
I'm sorry, hmm?

390
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:44,938
It was a misunderstanding.

391
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:50,319
I would never,
never do anything to upset you.

392
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:52,738
You know that, right?

393
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:56,074
Okay.

394
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:57,993
Dad's gonna go and have a nap now.

395
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:01,205
I'll feel more myself
when I've had a lie-down.

396
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,753
Oh!

397
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,090
What are you doing?

398
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:57,094
Lurking in the doorway
like a bloody Jehovah's Witness.

399
00:27:57,678 --> 00:28:00,556
I just... Do you wanna talk?

400
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:03,660
- You've already said you don't believe me.
- Well, that's not true.

401
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:06,019
I said you were under lots of pressure.

402
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:10,107
And yet, according to Gerald,
I aced my interview.

403
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:13,443
Oh. Well, that's great.

404
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:16,780
Yes, you seem exhilarated.

405
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:20,492
Do you not think it might be a bad time
for you to step up at work?

406
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:24,913
Grace.
I-I-I'm not fragile or weak or suicidal.

407
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:27,958
Someone tried to kill me.

408
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:31,086
And don't. Don't look at me like that.

409
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:34,590
I blame myself.

410
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:37,009
The only thing worse
than your pity is your self-pity.

411
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,344
I made those demands on you,
made you feel less of a man.

412
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:42,308
- Stop talki... Just stop talking.
- Drove you to do something so drastic.

413
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:45,601
- I did not try to kill myself.
- Please, JP.

414
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:47,495
If we could just get you
the help that you need.

415
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,062
- Shut up!
- Oh!

416
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:50,230
No!

417
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:07,623
Jesus Christ!

418
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:12,252
- Don't creep up on me like that.
- Relax. It's me.

419
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:16,340
Yeah. Sorry.

420
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:20,302
Um, I have to get back to work.

421
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:23,680
- What are you doing here anyway?
- Well, what am I supposed to do?

422
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:26,433
Pretend like it wasn't you in my bed
this last year?

423
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:28,936
I need to know what's going on.
What's hap...

424
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:33,148
We can't.

425
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,067
We can.

426
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:36,818
I can't, Ben.

427
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:39,238
Come on.

428
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,120
You don't answer my calls, Urs.

429
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:49,706
You don't return my texts.

430
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,291
I-I wasn't sure if they were...

431
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:53,293
If they were what?

432
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:56,421
We need to take a break.

433
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:58,423
Why?

434
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:00,133
It's just for a while.

435
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:03,470
There's... There's stuff going on that...

436
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:05,013
- What stuff?
- My stuff.

437
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:08,141
I'm married. I have a family...

438
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,185
And what, you just remembered that now?

439
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:17,150
For how long?

440
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:19,152
A week? A month?

441
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:21,321
I do... I don't know, just please don't...
I... I...

442
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:24,366
I'm barely hanging in as it is, okay?
I'm barely...

443
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:47,472
I have to get back to work.

444
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:53,145
Well, uh…
…let me walk you back then.

445
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:56,398
Please?

446
00:30:57,816 --> 00:30:58,817
Please.

447
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:09,953
Are you gonna share
your greasy sandwich with me?

448
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,081
So we've ordered a CT,

449
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:15,285
and we'd like to keep you in overnight
for monitoring.

450
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:21,215
- You're all right, Mammy. I've got you.
- Uh-huh.

451
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:32,351
- Did he hit you?
- Bibi!

452
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:34,353
What? We're all thinking it.

453
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:38,774
Well, I... I tripped and hit my head.
It was 100% my fault.

454
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,817
So, where even is he?

455
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:44,238
- Well, he's at the gift shop with Blanaid.
- Oh, really?

456
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:47,824
What, because a Lucozade and a bunch
of grapes will make this all better?

457
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:50,452
It's just a bump on the head
and a sore wrist.

458
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:52,704
If you could've seen his face
when I came around.

459
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:54,706
He was more upset than me.

460
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,459
I can't do this.

461
00:31:57,543 --> 00:31:59,086
Um, I have to go. Sorry.

462
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:01,129
Oh, Becka, wait. I need your help.

463
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:02,339
Anything.

464
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,300
Uh, could you do Minna's shopping for me?

465
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:07,636
JP usually does it.
She'll be expecting him.

466
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:08,846
Course.

467
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:11,265
It'll be just one less thing
for him to worry about.

468
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:12,975
He's barely recovered himself.

469
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:14,351
Mmm.

470
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:18,021
Oh.

471
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:20,607
- Ladies.
- Hey.

472
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:24,403
Only the best for my best girl.

473
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:27,531
How are you, Mum?

474
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:31,118
Oh, I'm just having a little rest.
Will you sit down beside me?

475
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:34,788
Nice family reunion.

476
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:37,791
No Ursula today?

477
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,711
You'd think this would be the one place

478
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:44,089
you actually had a chance
of pinning her down.

479
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:46,758
I'd say she's very busy, JP.
It is a hospital.

480
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:49,386
Oh, I'm sure she is. I just saw her, um...

481
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:53,056
What is he? Photography teacher?

482
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,558
Small world, isn't it?

483
00:32:55,184 --> 00:32:56,685
Well, thank you so much for coming.

484
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:58,997
I'm sure you've got your own lives
to be getting on with.

485
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:01,064
- I'll take it from here. Bye-bye.
- Hmm.

486
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:08,155
Well, look, hey, you know where we are.

487
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,115
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

488
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:12,242
- Okay.
- Bye.

489
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:16,955
Um, could you do me a favor?

490
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:19,791
Find some water
and a vase for these, please.

491
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:22,127
Thank you, love.

492
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:26,924
How are you, really?

493
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:30,719
I'm so tired.

494
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:34,848
Just say the word, Mammy.
Anything I can do for you? Anything?

495
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:40,604
Oh, I bought a bottle
of whiskey for Gabriel

496
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:43,357
to say thanks for saving my man.

497
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,108
You could drop it round to his.

498
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:48,612
- Yeah, sure. Mmm.
- Thank you.

499
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:54,743
Oh, hey. I just heard. Uh, is she okay?

500
00:33:54,826 --> 00:33:56,828
Yeah, sure. Yeah. Don't... Don't worry.

501
00:33:56,912 --> 00:33:59,373
You're juggling so many things
at the same time.

502
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:00,791
Don't know how you do it.

503
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:03,836
See ya.

504
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:09,132
I thought I'd vomit when I saw her.
She looks so fragile.

505
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:11,885
There's no booze on this menu.

506
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,428
- There's kombucha.
- Fuck off.

507
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:17,014
If he did this,
surely she'd trust us enough to tell us.

508
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:18,266
It's not that simple, is it?

509
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,311
If you'd seen the way he flipped
at me earlier, you'd know he did it.

510
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:22,396
He's dangerous.

511
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,565
So why are they sat there
like everything's peachy?

512
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:27,442
- It's so weird.
- They're just getting closer.

513
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:30,612
Aren't any of you concerned
that the prick may get his memory back?

514
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:33,114
Have you got the nasal spray?

515
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:37,452
Calm down.

516
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:41,706
I swear to God, you'd have an easier time
offing the bloody Roadrunner.

517
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:45,502
How do they euthanize
those people in Switzerland?

518
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:50,632
I don't know. Pentobarbital, maybe?

519
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,426
I'd need to look into it.

520
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:54,178
Well, we need to finish the job.

521
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:56,096
And quick.

522
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:00,559
Ooh, they have a warm chicken
and black pudding salad.

523
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:01,852
That sounds lovely.

524
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:05,063
Excuse me. Hi.

525
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:08,025
What are you gonna have?

526
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:09,526
Nothing.

527
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,610
Hello!

528
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,331
Did you start without me?

529
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:23,707
Mum, look at David's arm.

530
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,502
Oh, my God. What happened?

531
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:29,421
I fell off my bike. Dad made this.

532
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:30,839
Well, why didn't you call m...

533
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:33,592
I need to show your mum something.

534
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:35,969
- Keep watching and tell me what happens.
- But I just...

535
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:44,228
Your child needed his mum today.
Where were you?

536
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:48,524
Where were you?

537
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:51,652
Grace had an accident. Look, uh…

538
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:53,529
If I had heard your message,

539
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:56,114
- of course, I would've left.
- What about all the other times?

540
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:02,829
We're your family too.
You, me and those kids.

541
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:05,707
I know that.

542
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:07,292
Then why are you never here?

543
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:18,679
Did I miss anything good?

544
00:37:06,018 --> 00:37:07,019
Hello?

545
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:13,775
I think it's, uh...
I think it's too short.

546
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:17,821
Why just with a boat like this…

547
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:24,953
What are you looking at?

548
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:49,228
Inspector Loftus.

549
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:56,485
Despite holding public office,
I have a right to a private life.

550
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:59,613
This is serious, Inspector.
We have that proof you wanted.

551
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:01,281
In the John Paul Williams case.

552
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:04,868
- You want to do this now?
- Yeah.

553
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:08,205
Get back.

554
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:22,761
Get the trolley, will ya?

555
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:32,563
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

556
00:38:33,438 --> 00:38:35,482
Tom.

557
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,992
Do you know how much it costs
to exhume a body?

558
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:49,538
- Rich.
- Hey, Fergal.

559
00:38:49,621 --> 00:38:53,542
A murder inquiry in a town like this,
it upsets people,

560
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:55,919
especially if nothing comes of it.

561
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:57,713
So you'd wanna be bloody sure.

562
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:02,384
We have an eyewitness
who saw two Garvey sisters at the marina

563
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:04,219
on the night of John Paul's accident.

564
00:39:04,303 --> 00:39:05,888
The one where he nearly died.

565
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:10,285
Add to that the evidence Williams thought
someone was trying to kill him,

566
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:12,186
the younger sister's financial motive…

567
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:14,354
Look, if... if we can get that body up,

568
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:17,733
we could see what was
in him the night he was killed. Died.

569
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:21,653
And we also believe that the fire in the
cabin that Mr. Williams made a claim for

570
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:23,363
was yet another murder attempt.

571
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:41,423
Okay, you can have your postmortem.

572
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,175
Yes.

573
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,594
I'll get onto the paperwork straightaway.

574
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:47,429
Here.

575
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:57,415
The best thing that ever happened to you
was finding that check.

576
00:39:57,439 --> 00:39:58,440
Yeah, I'm over the moon.

577
00:39:58,524 --> 00:40:00,460
Those Garveys are about
to get what's coming to them.

578
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:03,362
Stay away from her, okay? Okay?

579
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:05,239
Yeah.

580
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:10,160
Eva?

581
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:29,513
Hey, pervert.
Um, are we still on for tonight?

582
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:31,014
I'm making margaritas.

583
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:45,571
Help yourself. Thieving little shit.

584
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:49,950
Geez, it's like having your home raided
by Stanley Tucci.

585
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:51,827
Sorry. I called.

586
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:55,998
- Do you mind? I'm skint.
- Aw, poor thing.

587
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,917
You can't afford limes
and premium spirits.

588
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:00,252
That's so sad.

589
00:41:02,546 --> 00:41:03,672
What's the occasion?

590
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,634
Oh. I'm, um...
I'm just having a friend over tonight.

591
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:09,386
From school.

592
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:11,972
- Nicola Ferris.
- Oh.

593
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:14,183
Lucky old Nicola.

594
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:17,603
Hope she enjoys candlelight.

595
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:22,566
- Oh! What are you...
- No. Come on!

596
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:26,236
The only reason you wax that mustache
is when you're getting some.

597
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:29,364
I can't make an effort for an old friend?

598
00:41:29,448 --> 00:41:33,535
Oh, no, you can. It's just, I've noticed
you smiling a bit more recently,

599
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:35,495
around a bit less…

600
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,664
Well, funnily enough, Eva,

601
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:39,917
my good mood is not down
to some lump of testosterone.

602
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,293
Mmm. Glad to hear it.

603
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:44,630
You would tell me though, wouldn't you?

604
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:49,426
Yeah, I'll write it in my diary
in glitter pen or something.

605
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,054
- I just want you to be happy.
- I am happy.

606
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:56,517
Thanks for the… I've gotta run.

607
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,519
Oh, shit. So do I. I left the bath on.

608
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:00,729
Balls!

609
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:06,151
And it's not a mustache, by the way.
It's a little peach fuzz!

610
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:09,446
And it's charming!

611
00:42:43,814 --> 00:42:47,609
Hey, I don't know if your phone
is outta juice or what's going on.

612
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:51,405
But I just wanted to say
that I can't wait to see ya,

613
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:53,824
and I'm excited,

614
00:42:55,075 --> 00:42:56,618
and I've got butterflies even.

615
00:42:58,036 --> 00:43:00,497
Oh and, uh, bring ice.
My freezer's fucked.

616
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:12,718
Minna.

617
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:23,061
Grace asked me to get your shopping.
What are you doing out here?

618
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:26,690
George has got a poorly chest.
It's time for his hot toddy.

619
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:29,318
Okay.

620
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:31,820
Let's get you in.

621
00:43:31,904 --> 00:43:34,156
You'll freeze your nipples off
in that nightie.

622
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:36,033
No.

623
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:38,827
Come on, you mad bitch. Get in there.

624
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,690
Hello. Malahide Garda Station.

625
00:44:08,774 --> 00:44:11,735
Hello. I want to speak to someone
about Roger Muldoon.

626
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:13,153
Uh, what's this regarding?

627
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:16,198
I need to know
if he was still in custody last night.

628
00:44:16,782 --> 00:44:19,576
I'm afraid we can't release
that information to the public.

629
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:23,038
Thanks. For nothing.

630
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,338
You know, if JP found you
roaming the streets in your scanties,

631
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:33,757
he'd put you into
that home he was talking about.

632
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:36,343
He can try.

633
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:41,682
He says his girls think
my house is a cesspit.

634
00:44:42,808 --> 00:44:44,685
- JP told you that?
- Mm-hmm.

635
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:46,979
That's rubbish, Minna.

636
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:50,858
You're happy in this house, aren't you?

637
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:53,861
- You wouldn't wanna leave?
- Why would I do that?

638
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,072
George calls it our love nest.

639
00:44:57,155 --> 00:45:02,077
He says I'm the only thing
he's ever loved more than his birds.

640
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:05,330
Don't tell me he romances them too.

641
00:45:11,003 --> 00:45:13,255
He likes to go down there and check.

642
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:16,758
- Check what?
- His birds.

643
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:19,553
Down where?

644
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:21,346
The basement.

645
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:27,686
He used to hate the place,
but now he's there all the time.

646
00:45:29,855 --> 00:45:30,981
George?

647
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:32,399
John Paul.

648
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:51,376
So how does he...

649
00:46:46,223 --> 00:46:47,391
What?

650
00:46:54,648 --> 00:46:55,858
Hmm.

651
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:22,509
What are you looking at?

652
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:43,590
George.
