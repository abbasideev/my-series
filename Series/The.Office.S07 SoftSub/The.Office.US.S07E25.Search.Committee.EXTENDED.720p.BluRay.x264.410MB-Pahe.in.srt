1
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,568
It's a beautiful
morning at Dunder Mifflin.

2
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,481
Or as I like to
call it, Great Bratton.

3
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,149
Keep it running.

4
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,381
CREED:
<i>Do I love being manager?</i>

5
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,589
I love my kids.
I love real estate.

6
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,125
I love ceramics.
I love my job.

7
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,354
I love wrestling.

8
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,456
Find out what
language this is.

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,962
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

10
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,699
Okay, team building.

11
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:44,109
On this side of the room,
Stanley, Phyllis, Jim,
Ted, Elroy.

12
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:48,046
And on this side of
the room, Pam, Meredith,
Phyllis, Creed...

13
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,344
He never called a meeting.

14
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,479
Boboddy. Boboddy.

15
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,149
What does
the first "B"
stand for?

16
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:57,813
What are we doing?

17
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,692
We're making acronyms.
Okay! What does the
first "B" stand for?

18
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,490
Um, business!

19
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:04,890
I like it!

20
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,893
Business. Good, Kevin!

21
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:09,698
All right, the "O."

22
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,168
We need a new manager.

23
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,144
So, after the Navy,
I thought,

24
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:58,708
"Cool, me
and America are square.
I've done my bit for the flag,

25
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,879
"and time for me
to look out for myself."

26
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,423
I had a buddy
in the paper biz
so I just dove right in.

27
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,083
How was your experience
in the Navy?

28
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,592
It was nuts. Yeah.

29
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,521
I was in Hong Kong
three times.

30
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,587
Still have pretty
crazy flashbacks from that.

31
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,792
Really? What kind of thing
did you do?

32
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,061
Meteorologist.

33
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,762
What do you mean, like
weather surveillance, or...

34
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:18,704
Predictor.
Constantly had to
predict the weather,

35
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,537
which is...
I'm not a god.
I'm just a guy in a shack

36
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,906
with a pair
of binoculars.

37
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,569
What do you think
about this weather
we're having now?

38
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,341
Don't even talk to me
about the weather, man.

39
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,382
It just all comes
back to me, you know?

40
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,384
There was this one night
I predicted it was gonna
be warm.

41
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,411
I sent 200 men out
without their jackets.

42
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,988
It was 60 degrees
that night,

43
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,350
52, with windchill.

44
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,098
You can't imagine
their faces shivering through
that Carrie Underwood concert.

45
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,563
Your paper experience
is very interesting.

46
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,537
And although
it's mostly manufacturing,

47
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:54,632
do you think you could
use that experience to
inform decisions here?

48
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,643
Absolutely, yes.

49
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,445
In fact, I actually
have a three-step plan

50
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,948
that I believe
could effectively
double your profits.

51
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,313
Really?
Yeah.

52
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,075
What is it?

53
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,782
(CHUCKLES) Nice try.

54
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,493
I'm sorry.
What is your
three-step plan?

55
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,631
Well, I mean, I can't
just hand you my plan.

56
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,697
I mean, if you guys
give me the job,
then you'll get the plan.

57
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,901
Well, it's an interview,
and we don't know that
you really have the plan.

58
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,963
I'm not gonna just make
up that I have a plan.

59
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,101
I got a plan. Believe me,
you guys want it.
You're in paper, right?

60
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,702
How do we know
that if you don't...

61
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,269
You could just be
saying it to get
the job.

62
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,315
I guess I could be
if I was...

63
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,783
Who would do that?
How about this,

64
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:40,116
why don't you give
us a part of the plan,

65
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,655
and that way we
know you have it.

66
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,556
Tell you what?
I'll give you part
three of part two.

67
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,489
Not gonna give
you a whole part.

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,550
Okay.

69
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:51,398
Color-code
said documents. T.M.

70
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,265
Did you just
trademark that?
What?

71
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,303
That's a verbal trademark.
That's an agreement.

72
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,697
JIM: <i>We are the search</i>
<i>committee, hand-picked</i>
<i>by our CEO</i>

73
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:04,108
<i>and tasked to find this</i>
<i>branch's new manager.</i>

74
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,372
Not everyone we
meet will be good,

75
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,875
but someone's
bound to be, right?

76
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,143
<i>And to be honest,</i>

77
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,049
<i>I think a lot of</i>
<i>the decent candidates</i>
<i>are right here in house.</i>

78
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,654
<i>So, I'm not too worried.</i>

79
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,956
But I'm really excited
to spend a lot of time
with Toby and Gabe.

80
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,788
Did you know that
Gabe's last name
was Lewis?

81
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:22,757
I had no idea.

82
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,454
Good morning.

83
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:25,897
Morning.
Good morning.

84
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,562
Good morning.

85
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,227
Did you have
a nice drive in?

86
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,565
I did.

87
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,736
I have a solid
relationship with Jo,
the company's owner.

88
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,535
I have management experience.

89
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,739
I have a good
friendship with Jim,

90
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,372
the head of
the search committee.

91
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,984
And it doesn't hurt that I'm

92
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,381
black!

93
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,020
We all know this
is a popularity contest.

94
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,357
And Darryl's
the coolest kid in school.

95
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:58,330
Used to be Jim.
Hasn't been Jim
in a long time.

96
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:02,725
It's good.

97
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,662
It's just words,
which will surprise people.

98
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:09,176
Yeah. It's based on
a really successful cigarette
ad campaign from a while back.

99
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,403
Those were good ads.
Yeah.

100
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,945
They got me smoking
when I was eight.

101
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:15,540
I couldn't quit smoking
until the government put out
better ads about not smoking.

102
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,181
I love smoking.

103
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,081
I really hope you get it.

104
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,452
The manager job?
No, I'm barely interested.

105
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,285
I just can't not
go for it, you know.
It's not the Bernard way.

106
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,088
We give it
the old college try,

107
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,822
and then in defeat,
we show grace.

108
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,461
Still, I'd really
like to see this office
with you in the boss's chair.

109
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,695
Don't even...
(GROANS)

110
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,635
You in the
boss's chair!
No.

111
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,900
ANDY: <i>In my family,</i>
<i>you don't really</i>
<i>go out and get things.</i>

112
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,466
If you want something,
you write it on a list

113
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,204
and then the housekeeper
goes out and gets it

114
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,178
on Wednesdays and Fridays.

115
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:50,674
So, I don't know.
I guess you could say
this job is on my list

116
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,980
and we'll see what
Rosa comes back with.

117
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,458
Did you hear anything?

118
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,886
Oh, I'm sure they'll
let us know when
they get the results.

119
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:08,059
It turns out that
Erin was born in the
basic time and region

120
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,864
that I gave
away a child.

121
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,231
So Phyllis
might be my mom.

122
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,640
I mean, the chances
are tiny, but...

123
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,110
Yeah, probably not.

124
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,113
I mean, it was
a big year for babies.

125
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,876
<i>Porky's</i> had come out.
Yeah.

126
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,346
I'm sure I was just
another <i>Porky's</i> baby.

127
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,283
But why not find out?
Yeah.

128
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,614
(CRUNCHING LOUDLY)

129
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,551
Should you really be
so blatant about that?

130
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,359
They won't make me manager,
and I won't settle for
anything less.

131
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,991
I've gone about as
far as I can here.
That's obvious.

132
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,064
I'm going to take
my talents elsewhere.

133
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,267
Are you really
gonna apply for work
at Scranton Bread Works?

134
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:50,573
Bread is the paper
of the food industry.
You write your sandwich on it.

135
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,009
Can you do any
better on salary?

136
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,878
Unfortunately, that
range is set at corporate.

137
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,808
What about mileage
when I use my car?

138
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,750
I mean, gas ain't cheap,
you know.
(CHUCKLES)

139
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,081
We think that
25 cents a mile
is pretty generous.

140
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,522
How about 27 and...

141
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,257
When I make
long-distance calls,

142
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,557
will they be monitored,
or is it on the honor system?

143
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,220
Okay.

144
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:13,722
(EXCLAIMS SOFTLY)

145
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,633
How odd!

146
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,641
A very unusual phone call
from the Senator's office.

147
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,805
The Senator wants me
to have lunch with him
at the Botanical Gardens.

148
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,438
The Botanical Gardens,

149
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,881
Scranton's hidden gem.

150
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,743
Don't eat any berries
you don't recognize.

151
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:38,150
How will your experience
selling refinery equipment

152
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,318
translate to our
smaller scale here?

153
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,725
You don't work
in sales, do you?

154
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:43,923
Human resources.

155
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,857
You see,
I sit across from a man,

156
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,802
I see his face,
I see his eyes.

157
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:56,004
Now, does it matter if
he wants $100 of paper

158
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:59,374
or $100 million of
deep-sea drilling
equipment?

159
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:00,778
Don't be a fool.

160
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,476
He wants respect.
He wants love.

161
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,652
He wants to be younger.
He wants to be attractive.

162
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:11,717
There is no such
thing as a product.

163
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,358
Don't ever think there is.

164
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,563
There is only sex.

165
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,095
Everything is sex.

166
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:26,763
You understand
that what I'm telling you
is a universal truth, Toby?

167
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:27,997
Yes.

168
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,974
Okay, I am... I'm almost
a little concerned that

169
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,742
you might be overqualified
for the position.
(LAUGHS)

170
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,215
Do you, um...
Do you think
that you are?

171
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,784
Do I look like someone
who would waste my
own time?

172
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,145
No.

173
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,353
Can you...
(CLEARS THROAT)

174
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:50,727
You are a man of
great confidence.

175
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,189
Could you speak
a little more to that

176
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,100
and what the role
of confidence

177
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,336
would be in a dialog
with a subordinate?

178
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,135
Will you be heard?

179
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,209
Will you have a voice?

180
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,870
Will I steamroll over you?

181
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:10,507
Do you feel heard
right now, Jim?

182
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,087
Do you have
a voice right now?

183
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,519
You can answer me.
Yes.

184
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,554
That was your choice,
not mine.

185
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,688
The fallacy is that it
is up to the steamroller.

186
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,762
It is up to the object

187
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,498
whether it will be
flattened or not.

188
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,634
And I can tell just from
the small interaction
we've had already,

189
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,400
you won't be
flattened by anybody.

190
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,038
Do you agree with me, Jim?
Yes.

191
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,839
Yes, you do.

192
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,597
He creeps me out.

193
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,735
But I think he
might be a genius.

194
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,602
Dwight, there's
a call for you
on line 2.

195
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,372
No, thanks.

196
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,715
He's in the shower.

197
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:32,962
Good luck, Darryl.

198
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,360
Thank you.

199
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,532
Is that the kind of boss
he would be?

200
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:41,734
Completely insensitive to
the insecurities of other
people in this office

201
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,868
who might
also be interviewing
for the manager position

202
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,242
and might also want to be
wished a little bit of luck

203
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,679
'cause they're kind of
spinning out a little bit?

204
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:52,645
I don't want
that kind of boss.
No, thank you. Not good.

205
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,512
Good man, though.
Nice guy. My best friend.

206
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,479
Think about it.

207
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:01,722
What other mammal,
besides humans, drinks
the milk of another mammal?

208
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:04,455
I mean,
you don't see a bear
drinking raccoon milk.

209
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,165
How long have
you been off dairy?

210
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,061
As soon as I can say no
to those two pushers,
Ben & Jerry.

211
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,660
(ALL LAUGHING)

212
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,832
So this is cool.
I think we make
a good fit.

213
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,641
Oh, we haven't started
the interview yet.

214
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,843
Were you joking?

215
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,175
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

216
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:24,207
Uh, yes. I was.

217
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,985
A little joke.

218
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,448
So how would you
go about settling

219
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,753
interpersonal conflicts
within the office?

220
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,959
I thought that was your job.

221
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,192
Well, it's
one of my strengths,
but it's the manager's job.

222
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,362
Well, for instance,
how did you deal
with it

223
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,426
when two warehouse
guys got into a fight?

224
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:47,668
I'll answer that, Jim.
I would use it as
an opportunity to teach

225
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:53,042
about actions and
consequences of actions.

226
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:02,947
Who's that?

227
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,885
So I think
all we need is a resume
and we'll be good, right?

228
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,996
I just thought you knew me.
Yeah, it's no big deal.

229
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,965
Just something
that looks like that.

230
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,428
JIM: Cool?

231
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,524
Let me...

232
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,292
Oh.

233
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,369
Cool.

234
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:29,448
Did you just interview?

235
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,245
Oh, unfortunately, yes.

236
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,311
What do you mean?

237
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,517
That business
can't attract anyone.

238
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,723
It's awful up there.

239
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,387
Those people seem
like they're in prison
waiting out life sentences

240
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,900
in a dying industry.

241
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,597
Place must be horrible.

242
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,038
I don't know if
I want this job.

243
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,338
Well, if I get this job
offer, then I know that
I'm gonna take it.

244
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:02,280
And if I take it, I know
that I'm never gonna quit.

245
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,546
And then 25 years
are gonna go by,

246
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,489
and I'm gonna die here.

247
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,690
What makes you feel qualified
to judge a place after
a mere interview?

248
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,301
What are you doing?

249
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,375
Stop trying
to figure me out.

250
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,910
I just did.
You can't.

251
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,840
It's done.
No, it's not.

252
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,278
I know you now,
your nature.

253
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,713
You don't know me.
You don't know
anything about me.

254
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:36,909
I'm done.
Get out of my head.

255
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,975
Not worth continuing.
Stop trying
to figure me out.

256
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,208
(CLEARS THROAT)

257
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:46,021
Do you even know
anything about paper?

258
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,390
How it's made?

259
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,022
I saw an episode on
how they make paper
on <i>Sesame Street.</i>

260
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,423
Get out.

261
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,436
I'm gonna prevent inferior men
from sullying my place of work

262
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,995
with their weak,
passionless leadership.

263
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:05,036
Do you see my hat? No?
That's because I just
threw it in the ring.

264
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,345
You guys pay
for relocation,
though, right?

265
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,475
Well, why would you need
relocation if you
already live in Scranton?

266
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:14,244
Well, I'd wanna move
further away, you know?

267
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,118
Just don't want
any chance of running

268
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,851
into my coworkers
outside the office.

269
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,494
Can I ask why you're
leaving your current job?

270
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:29,660
I'm leaving my other job
because they were all jerks.

271
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,705
Really. You know,
all of them.

272
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,331
You had your jerk-wads
and your jerk-offs, so...

273
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,135
Just between the wads
and the offs, I just thought,
"I gotta get out of here."

274
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,143
Is this a bad time
to be doing this?

275
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:43,248
I know
I'm having a bad time.

276
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,909
I'm sorry. If we did
something to upset you,

277
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,750
I'm sure it was inadvertent.

278
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,385
Wait.

279
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,428
Oh, why did I believe
that weirdo in the lobby?

280
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,961
These are the nicest
people I ever met.

281
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,497
Thank you.

282
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,165
I'm engaged.

283
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,208
Damn, girl.

284
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,015
PAM: It's gorgeous, Angela.

285
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,151
Yeah, I actually
know about nice rings,
and it is gorgeous.

286
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,242
Wow.

287
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,517
It's a little flashy.
I mean, what am I,
Naomi Judd?

288
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,390
Tell us the
freaking story!

289
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,993
Yeah, tell us
a story.

290
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:30,894
Okay. He took me
to the replica of
Monet's Japanese Bridge.

291
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,299
And then he put
this flower behind my ear,
which normally I would hate,

292
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,892
'cause it's so
civil rights-y.

293
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,301
Then he got down on
one knee and he said,

294
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,472
"Will you be
a senator's wife?"

295
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,532
(LAUGHS)

296
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,804
He talked about himself
in the third person?

297
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,644
Yes, Pam.
Not everyone is as
informal as you and Jim.

298
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:51,684
"Hey, Pam,
dude, whatever.
Wanna marry me?"

299
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,151
(ALL LAUGHING)

300
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,585
That's not accurate.

301
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,419
Then I saw flashes.
So, reporters were there.

302
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,949
They always find us.
And everyone was crying.

303
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,325
Even his aide.

304
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,421
Angela's engaged to a gay man.

305
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,758
As a gay man,
I'm horrified.

306
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,427
As a friend of
Angela's, horrified.

307
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:14,434
As a lover
of elegant weddings,
I'm a little excited.

308
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,409
But overall, horrified.

309
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,346
Andy? You all set?

310
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,873
Okay, guys. It's time.

311
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,282
It's pep talk time.
Tell me what I need to hear.

312
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,089
Hmm, are you sure
this is a good idea? I...

313
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,151
I hate to see
you disappointed.

314
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,559
That's not what
I was hoping for.

315
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:37,028
Okay, I just want
someone to tell me,
"You're gonna do great."

316
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,291
You'll do great.
Come on.

317
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,270
You guys are my best friends.

318
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:53,472
I'd be happy
if Andy were boss.
He listens to my stories.

319
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:56,038
And they're not
all A-plus stories,
let's be honest.

320
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,983
But you know what?
He always listens
like they're A-plus.

321
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,352
Well, some are A-plus.

322
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,448
I think Andy
should be the boss.

323
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,290
He's just so great.

324
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:11,556
If I'm being objective,
then Darryl, of course.

325
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,527
So, Andy, what
improvements would you
make as office manager?

326
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,468
For starters, I really
think we can streamline
communication around here.

327
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,840
Whoa. That's a very
heavy accusation to
level against Toby.

328
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,135
I wasn't accusing...

329
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,677
Well, Toby's in charge
of human resources.

330
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,269
That would include
communication.

331
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,877
I think that
Toby's done a fine job.

332
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,514
Right. I really wasn't
trying to insult anyone.

333
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,745
I didn't think you were.

334
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,550
I have two relationships
with Andy.

335
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,382
I have a personal
relationship,

336
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,016
and I have a professional
relationship.

337
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,285
Personally, yeah,
I think he's a rat

338
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,057
and I think
he's responsible
for the demise

339
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,564
of my relationship
with Erin.

340
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,693
Professionally...

341
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,536
He broke up
the happiest couple
in this office.

342
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,231
How many windows are
there in New York City?

343
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,435
What?
Critical thinking.

344
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,703
Common on-the-spot question
asked in an interview.

345
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,768
Okay. Uh, let me think.
Are you counting
car windows?

346
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,814
No. How far away
is the sun?

347
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,043
Ninety-three million miles.

348
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,645
Is it?
Yeah.

349
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,816
And the diameter of
the sun is 870,000 miles,

350
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,949
which makes it 109 times
wider than the Earth

351
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,855
and 333,000 times
heavier than the Earth.

352
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,327
Shut up about the sun.

353
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,830
Shut up about the sun!

354
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:23,931
Okay, I'm not a doctor,

355
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:26,598
but I think
the medical term
for that was a spaz out.

356
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,073
Gabe just lost it.

357
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,936
That's the best part about
convening a tribunal.

358
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,172
One bunal can go down,
and you still have
two bunals left.

359
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,842
Right?

360
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,751
Andy, how'd it go?

361
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,685
I don't want to brag, but...

362
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,657
I did my best.

363
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,989
Hello!

364
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,529
I forgot something in my car.

365
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,025
You guys are so cute.
When are you gonna
get back together?

366
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,730
Never. We're just friends.

367
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,794
Oh!

368
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,168
Okay, my mistake.

369
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,734
You know, you could have
any man in this
whole office with your legs.

370
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,413
I say go for it,
if you're interested.

371
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,915
But you're not,
so never mind.

372
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,963
I am unhappy
with the confusing

373
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:28,331
and, at times,
confrontational
nature of that meeting.

374
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,233
I wanted it to go better.

375
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,969
I wanted it to go better!

376
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,443
Yes, there used to
be a paper clip that
would pop up and say,

377
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,639
"Looks like you are writing
a letter or resume.
Would you like help?"

378
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,774
I believe his name
was Clippy.

379
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,377
CREED: First of all,
I wanna thank you

380
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,581
for your years of
patronizing our company.

381
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,757
I've got some bad news.
We're going out of business.

382
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,250
Saving face.

383
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,822
Yep, yep. I understand that.

384
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,466
Basically everything's
falling apart here.

385
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,298
How is this on me?

386
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,193
Hang up.

387
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,641
Corporate needs you
to find the differences

388
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,542
between this picture
and this picture.

389
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,471
Intel has told us there
were at least seven.

390
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,845
Okay. I already
see one. Give me.

391
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,041
Okay.

392
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,619
They're the same picture.

393
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:25,924
Well, I manage my department,
and I've been doing that
for several years now.

394
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:29,257
And, God, I've learned a lot
of life lessons along the way.

395
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,491
Your department's
just you, right?

396
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,795
Yes, Jim,
but I am not
easy to manage.

397
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,298
Great. Um,
can we just...

398
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,159
What was that?

399
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:42,698
We just have a lot
of serious candidates
to get through today, so...

400
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,973
Am I not
a serious candidate?

401
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,874
What do you
want me to say?

402
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:50,007
I mean, there's a line
of qualified people
out there.

403
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,017
We have a video
CV from England.

404
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,848
Are we all just
gonna pretend to...

405
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:55,953
Okay. Um...

406
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,156
What are your weaknesses?

407
00:20:58,224 --> 00:20:59,988
I don't have any, (BLEEP)

408
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,165
Erin, I believe you have
my resume on file.

409
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:12,501
Please print out four copies
on 32-pound cotton stock,
bright white.

410
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,561
No...

411
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,275
Ivory.
Yes, sir.

412
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:17,810
Who's in there now?
Kelly.

413
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:19,903
For God's sake.

414
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,574
So, Kelly, what do you think
the future holds for the
paper business?

415
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,116
Me peeing on
Gabe's corpse.

416
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,178
I want an interview.

417
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,315
How's the family?
Good.

418
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,257
Good? Are they good?
Yeah.

419
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,558
What's your daughter's
name again? Pee Pee?

420
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,689
Peepa.

421
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:39,959
Peepa. How is she?

422
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,193
Great.
Great!

423
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,058
Oh, that's great.

424
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,539
We never were very
good at small talk,
were we, Jim?

425
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:47,595
No.
Now, listen...

426
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,403
You're not getting
an interview, Dwight.

427
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,910
The whole point
of this search
committee process

428
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,775
is to prevent hiring
someone like you
ever again.

429
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,178
Okay. I know why
you're saying that, Jim.

430
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,840
I really do.
But think of it
this way.

431
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,952
The hand that reaches
from the grave to
grip your throat

432
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,215
is the strong hand
you want on the wheel.

433
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,689
Okay. That's vivid.

434
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,555
Now, I'm gonna make
you an offer, okay?

435
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,686
You even do so
little as grant
me an interview,

436
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:13,096
I will guarantee you
your dream work life, okay?

437
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,157
You roll in
at 10:00 a.m.

438
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,328
to your own private
reserved parking spot,

439
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:20,703
pick up your
daily free coffee from
Dwight's Caffeine Corner,

440
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,969
unlimited sex breaks
for you and Pam.

441
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,671
Yikes.
Erin will eat garbage
for your entertainment.

442
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:29,078
Wow. You know how
I like taking bribes.
(CHUCKLES)

443
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:31,447
But unfortunately,
Jo also took the
job away from you

444
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,110
because she doesn't
trust your judgment.

445
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,050
So how would that
look for me if
I recommended you?

446
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,387
Fine, I'll do it
without you.

447
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,317
You'll regret this.
Okay.

448
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,920
Let me get
that for you.

449
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:46,792
Thank you.
Okay.

450
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,569
As long
as you keep it moist,
it's easier to work with.

451
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:53,697
And I can't just use
a tube of crescent rolls?

452
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,677
You know what, go to
McDonald's for dinner.
Why cook?

453
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:00,037
Okay.

454
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,116
Pam,

455
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:06,384
I think Robert is gay.

456
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,017
The Senator?

457
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:11,319
He was married before,
and he has a kid.

458
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,688
So...
And don't say that thing

459
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,818
about how lots of
gay guys have kids.

460
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,494
I have a very
strong suspicion.

461
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:20,722
Did you?

462
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,669
Oh! (CHUCKLES) No.

463
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,760
No.

464
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,203
Did you see him
at a bathhouse?

465
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:28,901
What bathhouse?

466
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,068
The windowless building
by the Baskin Robbins.

467
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:33,001
What?

468
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,307
Forget it. I'm
never gonna know
what goes on there.

469
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:38,480
<i>Name: David Brent.</i>
<i>Occupation: Inspirer.</i>

470
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,609
<i>Status: None of your business.</i>

471
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,946
<i>Young, free and</i>
<i>single, though.</i>
<i>Thanks for asking.</i>

472
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,284
<i>Hear you're looking</i>
<i>for a new boss, yeah?</i>

473
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,790
<i>Someone to tell</i>
<i>a bunch of discontented,</i>
<i>under-encouraged drones</i>

474
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:49,954
<i>what to do every day.</i>

475
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,794
<i>Is that it?</i>
<i>Our out-of-touch</i>
<i>powers that be.</i>

476
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:55,357
<i>Want me to fire them?</i>
<i>They don't see things</i>
<i>your way?</i>

477
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,029
<i>Then I ain't that dude.</i>
<i>Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye.</i>

478
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,765
<i>Get some other</i>
<i>corporate suit to</i>
<i>lay down the law.</i>

479
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,431
<i>What? You've</i>
<i>changed your mind?</i>

480
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,339
<i>You're now looking</i>
<i>for a leader of men?</i>

481
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,970
<i>Ipso facto. Women too.</i>

482
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:07,713
<i>When do I start?</i>

483
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:08,803
<i>Eh?</i>

484
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,575
Hey.
Hi. Hey.

485
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:17,145
I realized I never paid
you back for that lunch you
paid for, like, a month ago.

486
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:18,650
Yeah, don't worry about it.

487
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:20,522
Well, it's money.

488
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:24,154
I was thinking I could make
dinner for you tonight,
like a Middle Eastern feast.

489
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,392
Chicken shawarmas,
shish kebabs,
pita with hummus.

490
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:31,760
Well, I think I only lent you
like $3. That would be so
much more trouble.

491
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:34,273
Just bring the money tomorrow.
No big deal.

492
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,071
Or else I'll break your legs.

493
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,837
Not if I can help it.

494
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,544
My friend at
the Scranton Blade

495
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,315
is totally plugged
into these matters.

496
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,246
You're in
the gay mafia.

497
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,918
You're thinking of
another group, much
wealthier, much older.

498
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,188
You sound ignorant.

499
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:58,724
You guys, um,
talking senator?

500
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:00,788
No.
No.

501
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,664
Why would we be
talking about
the Senator?

502
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,764
'Cause he's totally gay.

503
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,301
How do I know
that Robert is gay?

504
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:11,734
He "liked" my
Facebook photos at
3:00 in the morning.

505
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,338
It was a really
good photo, though.

506
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,912
Do you know what it took
to get Bob to notice me?

507
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,480
I waited in his
office every morning

508
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,044
wearing nothing
but kitty cat ears.

509
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,114
I did that every
day for two weeks.

510
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,522
And on the tenth day,
he walked in,

511
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:28,720
he was naked too,
except a dog nose.

512
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:30,758
Guess what we did then?
Bestiality.

513
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:31,990
I don't think
I can do that...

514
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:33,554
Yeah.

515
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:34,964
That's not
my personality.

516
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,196
If my daughter
were asking me...

517
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,497
Yes?
(LAUGHS)

518
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:45,203
I would say
if you want someone,
if you really want them,

519
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,043
go get them.

520
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,546
I do really want him.

521
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,976
So, uh, here you go.

522
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:56,317
Great.
Hope it's all right.

523
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,378
I'm sure it's fine.

524
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,849
The guy who
was in here earlier,
interviewed after me,

525
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,188
how'd he do?

526
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:03,695
Howard Klein?
No, no, no, no.

527
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,025
That's not who
I'm talking about.

528
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,556
Oh. Deshawn Williams.

529
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,192
Yes. How did he do?

530
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,737
He's an amazing man.
He's a Rhodes Scholar.

531
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:15,673
He invented an app
that invents apps.
Fantastic kisser.

532
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,142
Come on, man.
I'm being serious.
Don't joke.

533
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,471
Darryl, we all know you.

534
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:22,014
Your interview is not
nearly as important
as the other guy's.

535
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,647
First I'll take down
the cubicle walls.

536
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:30,018
But there aren't...
Symbol of transparency.

537
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,714
There'd be no titles.

538
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:34,092
Everyone has the same job.

539
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,992
Same goes for me.

540
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:39,832
I'll take your job,
but I'd reject the title.

541
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:40,957
A little unspecific.

542
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:44,435
Everyone would be known
for their accomplishments.

543
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:47,233
That's very interesting. Um...

544
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,298
I feel like
there might be
a conflict there,

545
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:52,207
and if a conflict did arise,
how would that be dealt with?

546
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,075
Oh. Yeah.

547
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,304
Hmm.

548
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,475
Scratch
everything from before.
I'll tell you what I'd do.

549
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,048
Go the other way.

550
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:02,020
More cubicles.

551
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:03,548
More division.

552
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:07,454
Everyone is
somebody's boss,

553
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:11,052
and that
person can fire
the person below them.

554
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,761
And once a month, the
lowest-performing person...

555
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:16,858
(MAKES CUTTING NOISE)

556
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:18,560
Bye-bye.

557
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,937
How would you compare
like an accountant
and HR?

558
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,999
Well, I'll tell
you how, shall I?

559
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,704
I'll tell you how.
Okay.

560
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:28,006
By splitting the difference.

561
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,906
Just somewhere in the middle.

562
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,177
I think that's probably
all we need to hear from...

563
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:34,276
Zen office.

564
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,810
Hmm?

565
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,349
Thought of that?
That's what I'd do.

566
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,793
Everyone takes
their shoes off
before they come in.

567
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:45,322
Okay? There'd be no desks.
You just sit on the floor.

568
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,329
That's very...

569
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,391
You've got a Thai
woman out in the back...

570
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,795
Saki.

571
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,661
Okay.
Saki.

572
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:53,967
That's not...

573
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,735
Saki is her name, okay?

574
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,936
She's administering massage,
all right, if you need it.

575
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,776
If you don't, whatever.
Just talk to her.
She's a person.

576
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,007
Either way,
15 minutes of
that, and you...

577
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,180
You are cracking to go.

578
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,011
(CLEARS THROAT)

579
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,750
Office of the future.

580
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,219
Like the inside
of a Virgin airplane.

581
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:18,224
Telecommuting, all right?
Everyone's at home.

582
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:21,790
The office is
just a big empty space.
It's just full of screens.

583
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:26,602
Sony. Sony.
Everything's just
Sony, made of Sony.

584
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:27,696
From Sony.

585
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:29,264
I don't think that's how
telecommuting works.

586
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:35,645
And then we sell tickets to
tourists for them to
see the office of the future.

587
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,845
Okay. Wow.
Cutting edge.

588
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,182
You have to hire me.

589
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,915
There's no ideas left.

590
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:46,215
That's all the ideas there is.

591
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:49,757
There's a lot more
where they came from.

592
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:59,097
Jim, what can you tell us?
Is there a frontrunner?

593
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,731
You know what?
They all just sort of
blend together after a while.

594
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,134
Well, there must be
someone who stands out.

595
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:07,179
No, not at all. In fact,
I'm not even taking
it seriously.

596
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,681
I think at the end of the day,
I'm just gonna pick a name
out of the hat.

597
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,738
OSCAR: Well...

598
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:12,512
The hell you will!

599
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,019
I worked for the
last boss for
15 years.

600
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,784
According to my doctor,
I don't have another
15 years

601
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:21,054
if I wanna keep up the same
dietary and sexual lifestyle,

602
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,219
which I intend to.

603
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,661
Oh, no, Stanley.
You'll live forever.

604
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,326
My next boss
will be my last boss.
He'll be at my funeral.

605
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,837
So I would appreciate it
if you would take
this seriously.

606
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:37,066
You pick a crappy boss,
you're responsible for
my crappy life.

607
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,008
Okay, everybody.
I was just making a joke.

608
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,807
I am taking it seriously.
I promise.

609
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,370
Are you?

610
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:47,614
Little advice?
Take a day off from
the whole Jim shtick.

611
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:49,549
Try caring about something.

612

Stern this morning?

620
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:21,512
No. Was he good?
Uh, Robin was good.

She's always good.

a familiar face on top.

aren't we? Four pages?

how you landed
in that ballpark.

enough to almost stretch

so much from them.

be interviewed
for the position.

in the office?

Yeah, but see, it's not.

I will not give up.
I won't even be
discouraged.

00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:03,749
Why? Because managing
this office is my destiny.

656
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,419
My only potential
obstacle is

657
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:11,088
if becoming manager is
someone else's destiny
as well.

00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,026

if this is a case
of clashing destinies,

660
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:18,663
I don't think
we should tell her.

day without telling me
I had lettuce in my teeth.

662
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:22,599
Screw her.

663
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,267

I would want to know.

MEREDITH: Yeah.
You gotta know.

665
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:29,279
Okay. But if Angela
can get a gay man
to marry her,

666
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,809
maybe I could get
a lesbian to marry me. Huh?

00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:34,742
Huh? That's hot.

668
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,618
You have
met a lesbian
in real life, right?

warn her about is that the

talking about that.

about marriage.

this probably is her
last chance at a family.

seem happy.

00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:54,567
You're right.
You're right.

676
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,835
She seems happy.

should we gossip about?

Yes. Yes, it will.

it's professional

with the receptionist,

so that she could be
with Andy,

ever seen.

Although he did
keep saying

767
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:14,928
that he needed two weeks off
right at the beginning

768
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,729
for a trip to
the Finger Lakes.

769

minutes he was like,

"Hey, just making sure the
Finger Lakes thing is clear."

and then disappear.

said she knew a man

Women in Business seminar.

822
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,903
I was the speaker, and
she was the only person there

823

who wasn't trying to
sell some Curves ripoff.

824
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,377
You know, she also
gave me reason to think

825
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:42,277
that maybe she
wasn't a good fit.

00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:44,145

you must hire her.

who's clearly a fit,
then fine.

they fit real good.

838
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:13,471

on a puppet show today

to warn people about the
faulty outlet behind the
fax machine.

840

But change of plan.

the FedEx forms,

842
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,723
and an evil witch named
Angela turned me into
a puppet!

843
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:30,284
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
Low blow, puppet.

844
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:35,130
And there's only one thing
that can change me back
into a real girl.

845

It's good.

846
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:41,365
It's just that I wish
the puppets would talk
more about the alphabet.

847
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:45,775
Not for me, but if
any kids are watching.

848
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:49,143
A, B... And so forth.

849
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:50,808
You know.

850
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,977
M, N, L, O, P.

851
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:57,544
F.

852
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:02,127
I need
the most special
thing in the office.

853
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,183
Silence?

854
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,526
A date with
the best salesman,

855
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,695
Andy Bernard!

856
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:12,759
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

857
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,467
Hey, Erin.

858
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,972
Where'd you learn
how to puppet like that?

859
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:25,013
I've done it all my life.
Listen, I'm really flattered,

860
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,278
but I don't think we should.

861
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,826
Erin's my best friend
in this office,
hands down.

862
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:37,888
But

863
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:41,558
when she asked me out,
I just didn't have
that feeling, you know?

864
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,863
Aren't there some things
that you really want to like

865
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:46,837
but you just can't
seem to like it?

866
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,931
Like <i>Mad Men</i> or football.

867
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:53,241
Let's not forget.
Erin chose Gabe
over me.

868
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:54,540
That happened.

869
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,410
I'm not gonna apologize
for getting over her, okay?

870
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:04,214
I'm sorry.
I would go for
someone who's more...

871
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:07,824
She's great, though.

872
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:17,765
Hey, Jim. Elevator man.
Hey. Yup. All right.

873
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,599
So, listen.

874
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:24,266
I feel like
I came off terribly today,
and I want to just start over.

875
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:26,436
What can I do?
Should I call Jo or...

876
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:28,412
Maybe have my
old boss call her.
Listen, listen, listen.

877
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,380
This isn't you, okay?

878
00:42:30,448 --> 00:42:34,078
The Darryl we all love,
he's calm, he's confident.

879
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:36,121
So, just be that guy.
Okay.

880
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:37,849
All right?
Okay, yeah.

881
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:39,288
I was thinking that.
All right.

882
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,689
Thanks. Means a lot.
Yup.

883
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:42,749
Of course.

884
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:46,555
Stanley, I won't be able
to invite everyone
to the wedding,

885
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:48,759
because we wanna
keep it to 350.

886
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,062
I'll get over it.

887
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:52,194
I mean,
we just have to
see how many senators

888
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,535
and members of Congress
want to attend

889
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:57,040
before we can open it
up to regular people.

890
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:00,745
Pam, you know
how you and Jim did
your ironic wedding?

891
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:03,714
Do you still have the plans
for the dream wedding that
you couldn't afford?

892
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:05,614
That was our dream wedding.

893
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:07,982
Niagara Falls?

894
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,951
Pregnant?
That was your dream?

895
00:43:11,823 --> 00:43:13,223
Pork medallions?

896
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,822
I hope you have a very
beautiful wedding, Angela.

897
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,394
So, Angela,
are you looking forward
to your wedding night?

898
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:29,006
What goes on in
our bedroom is none
of your business, Phyllis.

899
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:30,705
Or yours.

900
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:38,346
Oscar, you build up
these enemies in
your head

901
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,415
and you want to
see them suffer.

902
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,922
But the thing is,
you don't.

903
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,181
You don't.

904
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:53,193
Oh, Oscar.

905
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,090
All right.

906
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:57,795
Name.
Dwight Schrute.

907
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:00,100
Thank you, Mr. Schnoot.
We will let you know.

908
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,201
You have to interview me.
I just did.

909
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:04,868
The answer to that
one question told me
everything I need to know.

910
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:06,370
How did I do?
To be honest,

911
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:09,414
I'm leaning
towards another man.
His name is Jacques Souvenier.

912
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,143
But would you like
to be his number two?

913
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:16,153
God, it's gonna be hard,
but, yeah, I would do it.

914
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,618
Okay, well,
there's a lot
to think about,

915
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,782
so we will
get back to you.
No.

916
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,086
I demand more questions.

917
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,627
All right, guys.
Good day.

918
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,252
A lot of candidates.
Let's discuss.

919
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:26,263
Okay, if you're not
gonna interview me,
then I'll do it.

920
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,354
Yes.

921
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,763
What will be
your first priority?

922
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:33,564
I will have seven
first priorities.

923
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:35,869
Safety, profits,

924
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,674
fostering a community
of self-reliance and
entrepreneurship,

925
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:42,842
listening, respect
for human life,

926
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:47,849
bolstering our public image,
and getting everyone
home on time.

927
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,684
Dwight, let me be frank,

928
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,585
in an accident that
no one can blame you for,

929
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,785
an antique gun was discharged
while you were acting manager.

930
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:58,062
How are we ever
to trust you again?

931
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,689
That's a great question.

932
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:09,564
I am going to institute
a strict "No firearms"
policy for this office

933
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,109
that extends
to myself as well.

934
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,412
Wow. All of my
concerns are disappearing.

935
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,477
Thank you, Dwight.
Thank you.

936
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,041
(CLEARS THROAT)

937
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:24,354
You'll be hearing
from us shortly,
Mr. Schrute,

938
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:27,386
and I think you're going
to like the call you're
going to receive.

939
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,516
Oh, come on.

940
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,363
I'm just happy
that I got this meeting.

941
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:37,730
(DOOR CLOSES)

942
00:45:37,802 --> 00:45:38,997
Well, that was quick.

943
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:42,199
(SIGHS)
Very, very
interesting.

944
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,967
And you know what?
I'm impressed.

945
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,805
He's not a real candidate.

946
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:48,778
I don't know, Jim,
'cause it makes me
think about something

947
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,178
that my
grandfather
used to say,

948
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:53,241
which is that
sometimes the hand
that jumps out of the grave

949
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:54,842
and grabs you
around the throat,

950
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,320
that is the hand that
you want on the wheel.

951
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:59,448
You took the deal.
Yeah. It was a great deal.

952
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:00,786
That's not okay.

953
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,884
I don't know,
Dwight seems like
a great leader to me,

954
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,328
and I look forward to
the personal perks that
he promised me privately.

955
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:07,626
What do you think, Toby?

956
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,291
Well, we could try him
out for a little while,

957
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:13,805
and if it doesn't work out,
you know, maybe one of us
could, you know, step in.

958
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:16,133
What is happening
right now?

959
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:21,077
Is it true that you're
making Dwight the manager?

960
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:22,511
No. Why would
you think that?

961
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,879
Well, he and Kelly said,
then they pre-fired me.

962
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:25,939
Okay.

963
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,984
Okay, guys, just so you
all know, no decision
has been made.

964
00:46:32,056 --> 00:46:34,423
And Dwight is definitely
not the boss.

965
00:46:34,492 --> 00:46:37,326
That is correct actually,
Dwight is not the manager yet.

966
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:39,796
No, no, no, not ever,
'cause that's not
gonna happen.

967
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:41,765
Well, it's not
entirely up to
you, is it?

968
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,495
Seems to me like someone
is getting a little
power mad.

969
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:47,231
Am I the only one
who remembers what he
did when he was in charge?

970
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:48,796
I feel like I'm going
a little bit crazy.

971
00:46:48,873 --> 00:46:51,775
Tuna, you're completely sane.
Thank you.

972
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,342
Who do you like
for the job?

973
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,443
Is there anyone
who maybe was a little
underwhelming at first

974
00:46:56,514 --> 00:47:01,179
but now seems like a safe,
if not slightly unexciting,
choice?

975
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:04,653
Okay. It seems like everybody
has an opinion, so who else?

976
00:47:04,722 --> 00:47:06,156
Anybody?
Do you mean it?

977
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,419
Anybody? Are you sure?

978
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,926
I suppose I am.

979
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:13,522
Okay. Well, what do
I want in a manager?

980
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,895
Let me see.

981
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:19,760
What do I want?

982
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:21,598
I don't think he meant...

983
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:24,573
Hey, so now anyone
gets to talk at any time?

984
00:47:24,642 --> 00:47:25,803
Go ahead.

985
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:28,872
What do I want?

986
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:34,344
I'm looking for
someone who...

987
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:39,156
Everyone is listening to me.

988
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:41,353
Can I say...
JIM: Yes.

989
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,654
I think it should be Darryl.

990
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:44,093
JIM: Okay.
What a surprise.

991
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:45,686
Minorities sticking together.

992
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:47,129
Kelly's on your side.

993
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:49,827
I'm sorry, is that all
you think of me?
A minority?

994
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:54,668
I am so much more than that.
I am a dancer. I'm a singer.
I'm a fashion designer.

995
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:57,004
Whoever it is, I think
they should be lame.

996
00:47:57,842 --> 00:48:01,540
Kind of
a non-threatening,
moderate personality.

997
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:03,576
I want an outsider.
Perfect.

998
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:05,843
There are several
outside candidates
that we think would be...

999
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,213
No, I mean an outsider.

1000
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,584
Like someone on
the margins of society

1001
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:12,248
who doesn't see
things the way we do,
like a homeless person.

1002
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,018
A homeless person. Really?

1003
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:16,323
A homeless person.

1004
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,022
No. You're right, Pam.
Let's just leave them

1005
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:19,825
to the welfare system
and let that handle it.

1006
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,798
No, I want you to
say that you think

1007
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:25,132
the best person to be
our new manager is
a homeless person.

1008
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:26,568
Let me guess
who you want, Pam.

1009
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,106
Rachael Ray?
The ladies of <i>The View?</i>

1010
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:33,109
I got away
with everything
under the last boss,

1011
00:48:33,177 --> 00:48:35,078
and it wasn't
good for me at all.

1012
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:38,139
So I want guidance.
I want leadership.

1013
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,609
But don't just, like,
boss me around,
you know?

1014
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:42,880
Like, lead me.

1015
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:48,016
Lead me when
I'm in the mood to be led.

1016
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:49,987
I just want, for once,

1017
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:53,963
a smart,
professional, decisive,
well-hung man in his 40s.

1018
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:55,932
Hey, hey, hey!
Okay, fine.

1019
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:58,725
Uh, the guy with
the tiny penis.

1020
00:48:58,803 --> 00:49:01,363
Are you happy?
Let's hire that guy!

1021
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,203
She may have a point there.

1022
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:05,975
Would a small penis work?

1023
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,311
Small to moderate.

1024
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:09,642
Gotta catch a plane.

1025
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,840
Hey, Gabe, I'm sorry.

1026
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:13,646
We didn't get you
a cake or anything.

1027
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:14,741
We're gonna miss you.

1028
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:17,254
Well, I'm still the
corporate liaison
to the branch.

1029
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:20,018
You are not leaving
without giving me
a hug.

1030
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:22,349
Ugh.

1031
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,258
Okay, you know what?
You don't need to
make that sound.

1032
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:26,888
I'm sorry. You were just a lot
bonier than I thought you
were gonna be!

1033
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,626
There are plenty of people
who love touching me.

1034
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:30,295
I'm a terrific hugger.

1035
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:31,959
I've been with
a bunch of girls

1036
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:33,766
where that's basically
all they wanna do.

1037
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:35,671
I will see you all soon.
Later, man.

1038
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:36,900
We'll miss you.
Good luck.

1039
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,237
RYAN: Good luck
at your new job.

1040
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,572
Take care, man.
DWIGHT: Gonna miss you, Gabe.

1041
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,340
Listen up.
Listen up, ladies.

1042
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:44,912
I want the job.

1043
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,482
There. I said it.

1044
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:51,112
I'm educated, I'm capable,
I like all of you,

1045
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:54,156
and I won't
make any changes.

1046
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:56,086
I see it.

1047
00:49:56,627 --> 00:50:01,065
I see it like I see a mountain
that I'm standing in front of
and facing and I'm liking.

1048
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:02,422
PHYLLIS: Yeah. Yeah.

1049
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,662
Andy would be
wonderful as boss.

1050
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,167
Erin made a good point.

1051
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:10,070
No. We're not related.
I got the call.

1052
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:13,439
But I'll tell her
some other day.

1053
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:16,178
Okay, what's going on?

1054
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:19,173
I thought
I told you guys to
expand the company.

1055
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:23,454
It looks
exactly the same.
I'm very disappointed.

1056
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,956
Jordana, get me
Jo on the phone.

1057
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,456
Okay, nobody say anything.

1058
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:41,430
Hey, Creed, this is Jo.
No, don't say another word.

1059
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:44,998
I need you to take
a nap right now. Yes.

1060
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:49,544
I want to talk
to you in your dream.
Lay down and put the phone...

1061
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:54,978
Great. Very good.
Okay, you gonna
go to sleep.

1062
00:50:55,653 --> 00:50:56,985
Okay, I think we have
about 40 minutes.

1063
00:50:57,855 --> 00:50:58,845
What about Darryl?

1064
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,951
We can all agree that
he's a standup guy, right?

1065
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:05,224
Very nice, laid back.
Overall, just a good guy.

1066
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:08,164
What if he brings some of
those warehouse types
up here?

1067
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:09,598
They're not carnies.

1068
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,995
MEREDITH: Can we see
a birth certificate?

1069
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,663
I mean, how do we know
he wasn't born in
Mubajuba or something?

1070
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,035
What difference
would that make?

1071
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:18,371
I'm just saying American
jobs should go to Americans.

1072
00:51:18,509 --> 00:51:19,499
(SPITTING)

1073
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:23,409
Meredith, you can't
just spit in the office.

1074
00:51:24,348 --> 00:51:25,680
Okay, I went too far.

1075
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:27,507
Angela.

1076
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:30,018
Well, let me be clear.
I only speak for myself,

1077
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,113
and not myself
and the Senator.

1078
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:34,519
I think we have some
wonderful candidates,

1079
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,891
and there is a great
lively debate here.

1080
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,723
But let's think about...
No. No.

1081
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:41,391
No. Sorry.
We cut Kevin off
for the same thing.

1082
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,593
You have to
have something
to say if you talk.

1083
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:44,828
Exactly.

1084
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:46,837
Jada. No,
no, no. Jada,
what are you...

1085
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,807
Oh. So sorry, guys.

1086
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:52,342
I hope my family
didn't disrupt
your meeting.

1087
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:56,047
Daddy, are these the people
who are making you manager?
(EXHALES)

1088
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,207
Maybe, sweetheart.
(EXHALES)

1089
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,308
Single dad. Challenges.

1090
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:03,450
JADA: I don't know if
he'd be a good manager,

1091
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,954
but he's
a really great dad.

1092
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,581
Okay. This was
a mistake. Let's go.

1093
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,529
It seems like we
all know enough to vote.
Should we just vote now?

1094
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:12,824
What?
No, no, no.
It's not a vote.

1095
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,956
Then what was this all about?
I don't know.

1096
00:52:15,032 --> 00:52:16,898
This conversation
really got away from me.

1097
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,492
I don't care.
They can just vote.

1098
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:19,867
No, they can't.

1099
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,700
That's not how
this is gonna work.

1100
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,765
(EXHALES)
We're going in this room.
We're gonna have a meeting.

1101
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:26,174
We're gonna make
a recommendation to Jo,

1102
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:29,213
and she's gonna give you
her recommendation on
Monday, okay?

1103
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,014
What the hell
happened out there?

1104
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:38,522
Sometimes you hear people
talking about failing upwards.

1105
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,323
I think I'm about to do that.

1106
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,621
This job?
Oh, yeah, I'll get it.

1107
00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:46,897
Jo's an old friend.

1108
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:50,163
I think
I'm her best friend.

1109
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:51,900
She's not
my best friend.

1110
00:52:52,236 --> 00:52:54,068
Every day, I have
a blueberry muffin.

1111
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,567
Today I did not have
a blueberry muffin.

1112
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,067
Should have had
the blueberry muffin.

1113
00:52:59,443 --> 00:53:02,811
Especially considering how
incredibly superstitious
I am.

1114
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:05,213
No. I've never
been more sure of
anything in my life.

1115
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:07,875
I will be
the new boss of...

1116
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:11,244
Vance Refrigeration.

1117
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:15,354
Honestly, I think
I sabotaged myself.

1118
00:53:15,459 --> 00:53:17,724
It's like I'm
afraid of being happy.

1119
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:20,060
Case in point,

1120
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,193
I was supposed to
start another job today.

1121
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:25,231
I will get offered the job.

1122
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:29,029
That's a call I've
received many times.

1123
00:53:29,106 --> 00:53:33,202
The slight hopefulness
in their voice,
the pregnant pause

1124
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:36,338
while they wait
to hear my response.

1125
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:39,583
And then my response.

1126
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:43,484
I want the job.
I really do.

1127
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:46,486
It's just the rest
of my family's in the
Finger Lakes right now.

1128
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:49,159
I'm supposed to be in
the Finger Lakes
right now.

1129
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:53,095
I told them I was on a hike,
snuck away to do this
interview.

1130
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:55,566
I gotta get back pretty soon.
They'll worry.

1131
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:57,926
People disappear
in the Finger Lakes.

1132
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:03,701
I will run this branch or
I will destroy this branch.

1133
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:09,004
Or, I don't know.
Something always
works out.

1134
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:17,814
<i>You remind me so much</i>
<i>of my fourth biggest client.</i>

1135
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:19,254
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Is that right?

1136
00:54:19,323 --> 00:54:20,552
<i>I think</i>
<i>you two should meet.</i>

1137
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:21,848
Well, okay...

1138
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:25,828
Hey, Jordana, patch
my ninth and my fourth
biggest client together.

1139
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,259
(IN MAN'S VOICE) Hello?

1140
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:32,460
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Hello!

1141
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:34,068
(IN MAN'S VOICE)
Hi, how are you?

1142
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:35,536
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Oh, I'm good!

1143
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:39,043
Don't you just love paper
and things about paper?

1144
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,076
(IN MAN'S VOICE)
Hey, are you single?

1145
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:43,011
This seems like
a love connection to me!

1146
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,104
<i>It's kismet.</i>

1147
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,743
Personally, I think
Darryl would be good.

1148
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:50,377
It has to be Darryl,
or someone I don't know.

1149
00:54:50,921 --> 00:54:52,150
I thought the woman
who came in,

1150
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:54,123
she seemed like
she had a fun energy.

1151
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:57,559
I'm not a sexist.
I just really don't
want it to be a woman.

1152
00:54:58,529 --> 00:55:02,125
I just feel that
women are generally
less competent than men

1153
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:03,861
and less rational.

1154
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:05,732
Again, I'm not a sexist.

1155
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:10,968
Even Andy...
They need to pick someone.

1156
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:14,468
Just someone. Fast.
