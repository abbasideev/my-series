1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,505
Kahlua sombrero, please.

2
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:04,881
All right.
So just you tonight?

3
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:08,092
Actually, I'm meeting somebody,
but I'm a little bit early.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,971
Leaving my company
after 19 years.

5
00:00:12,305 --> 00:00:13,431
I'll drink to that.

6
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:15,850
I'm starting at
a company this week.

7
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:17,268
Oh, really?

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,728
To beginnings and endings.

9
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:22,982
And to middles. The unsung heroes.
And to moms.

10
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:24,609
The moms of the troops.

11
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:25,818
Mmm.

12
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:28,780
Do not tell my fiancÃ©e
I'm drinking on a Wednesday.

13
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:30,490
I won't.

14
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:32,367
I don't know her.

15
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,535
Moving out to the 'burbs.

16
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:36,079
Actually, I'm moving further than
the 'burbs. Moving to Colorado.

17
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:37,205
Colorado?
Yeah.

18
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:38,831
Sunshine State.
Yep.

19
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:39,916
Don't mess with Colorado.

20
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,000
No, don't.

21
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:42,502
Doing some skiing?

22
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:44,712
No, no. I don't want to
end up like Sonny Bobo.

23
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:48,007
Well, that's just good
sense right there, yeah.

24
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:50,677
Everyone I know
who skis is dead.

25
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:54,097
You know what? I would like
to try the luge, though.

26
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,224
Try it once, you're hooked.

27
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:58,184
That's my guess.
That's what I've heard.

28
00:00:58,268 --> 00:00:59,477
I'm an Olympics nut.

29
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,688
Oh, yeah? Me, too.
Summer or winter?

30
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:04,107
Summer.
Summer.

31
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:06,359
Knuckle. Actually,

32
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:08,570
I've got to come around and give you.
. . Yeah, come on.

33
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:11,406
You know, it's funny.
I actually tried

34
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,575
to get an animal
Olympics going.

35
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:15,159
Really? What happened?

36
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,829
You know, life happened.

37
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:20,039
What are you gonna miss
most about Scranton?

38
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:24,335
Oh. Wow. The mountains,
where things are. Mmm-hmm.

39
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:26,879
That's the way it goes.

40
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:29,299
Man, he is late.

41
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:30,800
I'm gonna call him.
Do you mind? I'm sorry.

42
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,260
No, no.

43
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:34,012
Where is this guy?

44
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,267
Excuse me.

45
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:43,438
Hello?
This is Michael Scott.

46
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,189
Yes, hi.
Yes.

47
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,316
You running late?

48
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,027
No, I'm here.
I'm at the bar.

49
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,111
I'm at the bar, too.

50
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,155
You are? What bar?

51
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:57,702
I'm at the bar, the bar that's
located in the lobby of the hotel.

52
00:01:57,994 --> 00:01:59,037
I do not see you.

53
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,121
How long have you...

54
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:03,291
I've been here about, gosh,
over half an hour.

55
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:04,626
Okay, yeah, me, too.

56
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:06,753
Sorry.
Sorry.

57
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:07,920
What are you wearing?

58
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:10,548
I'm wearing
a gray suit, red tie.

59
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:12,550
Are we both at
the right place?

60
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:15,011
Which place would...

61
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:16,179
I hear your voice.

62
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:17,680
I hear your...
I see your lips moving.

63
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:19,057
I hear your voice

64
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:23,311
in the phone. And that's...
Man! And... Oh, brother.

65
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:26,230
Michael Scott.

66
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:27,315
Deangelo Vickers.

67
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:28,650
Wow.

68
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,652
That is insane.

69
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:33,529
"That is insane" is right.
That's the right term.

70
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:36,366
Bartender, let's get some
vodka up in this cranberry

71
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:37,825
and one for my friend.

72
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:41,371
I have heard that it is impossible
to become addicted to vodka.

73
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:44,624
That is true. That is true.
Vodka is non-addictive.

74
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:48,378
Most of the higher
spirits are undetectable.

75
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:49,754
It's because
of the potato.

76
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,339
One, two, three.
...two, three.

77
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:52,965
To new friends.

78
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:55,343
Wow.

79
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,511
Wow.
Wow.

80
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,597
This is gonna take hours.

81
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:02,183
Are her breasts
different?

82
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,226
No panties
on this one.

83
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:04,519
Okay, good.
Good.

84
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:06,729
And I think the sail
was folded differently.

85
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,648
Oh! No. No, it's good. That's okay.
That's okay.

86
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:09,691
It's all good.

87
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:12,860
On this one, I think
she's like, "Get lost,"

88
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:14,654
but on this one,
I think I have a chance.

89
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:15,738
No.
Okay.

90
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:17,198
Now, I still think
the sail is different.

91
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:18,533
Come on.

92
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:19,659
Hey, I think
this is broken.

93
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,120
Wanna play again?
Definitely!

94
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:23,788
That right there...

95
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,164
You want to try this.
Trust me.

96
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,290
Really?
Trust me.

97
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:28,459
You want to try this.

98
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:29,669
Mmm!

99
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,629
Are you kidding me?
Mmm-hmm!

100
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,674
Because one day, they say that
blueberries prevent cancer,

101
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:37,093
and then the next day, they say
that blueberries cause cancer.

102
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,886
That's totally true.

103
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:42,807
You know what would be a great Onion
headline? "Cancer prevents cancer."

104
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,024
That's so Onion.
I know!

105
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,819
It's so you,
but it's also so Onion.

106
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,197
Here we go. Ready?

107
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:59,323
I am ready.

108
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:00,575
All right, here we go.

109
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:06,164
Well, this is it.
What do you think?

110
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:11,085
She'll do.
Oh, she'll do just fine.

111
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:16,799
I am very much looking forward
to tomorrow. It is...

112
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:19,927
It feels like the
culmination of a lot of hard work,

113
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:21,971
a lot of good fortune and...

114
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:26,517
Hey, come on. Did that.
. . Did that just happen?

115
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:30,480
We should write a movie or something.
I'm serious.

116
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:57,548
Rise and shine.
Coffee time.

117
00:04:58,382 --> 00:04:59,383
There you go.

118
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:04,972
Do not talk to me
until I have had my coffee.

119
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:09,435
Until I've had my coffee,
do not talk to me.

120
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:14,732
Mmm.

121
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:18,444
Oh, I feel better.

122
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:19,821
I feel awesome.

123
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,781
It does not agree
with me,

124
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,450
coffee...
No.

125
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:25,827
...and yet,
I have to have it.

126
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,496
You know what?
Coffee keeps me regular.

127
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,039
Yeah.

128
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,001
That's the best time of the day.
That's... That's...

129
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:35,461
In that regard.
Right, right, right.

130
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:36,587
And it's the best
time of the day.

131
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:37,713
Right, right, right.

132
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,467
I give it about
seven minutes.

133
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:43,636
Really.
Yup.

134
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,179
Seven minutes from this.

135
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:46,806
Beeline.

136
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:50,476
So at 8:37...

137
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,024
Michael is leaving.

138
00:05:57,108 --> 00:06:00,319
And apparently they already
hired a new manager.

139
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:03,614
And we're meeting him today.
It's a lot to process.

140
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:06,576
Paperwork-wise.

141
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:15,960
Nope, it's not Ashton Kutcher.
It's Kevin Malone.

142
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:19,171
Equally handsome,
equally smart.

143
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:22,633
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

144
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:26,971
Good morning. Good
morning, to you.

145
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:32,518
What's this?

146
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,146
Oh, nothing.
That is just a screenplay.

147
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:39,483
The Adventure Pals by Deangelo
Vickers and Michael Scott.

148
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,320
Oh, my gosh,
it's 150 pages long.

149
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,406
Okay, everyone,
as you know,

150
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:49,327
one of my favorite things
is fanfare for its own sake.

151
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,621
So without further ado,

152
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:53,706
let's all start clapping.

153
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:01,005
Presenting Deangelo Vickers!

154
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,800
Hi. Hello.

155
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,511
Come on out!

156
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,974
Hello. Hey.
How are you, sir?

157
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:13,434
I'm well, sir,
how are you?

158
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,520
Uh, can I just say I am so
excited to be working here.

159
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:20,024
We couldn't be more excited
about having you here. Welcome.

160
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:24,278
Little bit about myself, I love the
American southwest, for starters.

161
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:28,074
You may call them Arizona,
New Mexico, Nevada, Utah.

162
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:29,450
I call them heaven.

163
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,453
I have a peanut allergy,
something I live with.

164
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,580
It's a part of me. I've
learned to cope with it.

165
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:38,042
I was a nationally ranked
high jumper in high school.

166
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:39,585
Really?
Yeah.

167
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:40,628
I didn't know that.

168
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,630
Couldn't do it in college
for academic reasons,

169
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,924
and that's something
that still bugs me.

170
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:50,388
What else? I'm just as comfortable
at a ball game as I am at the opera.

171
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,306
I was a...

172
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,309
Did I want to be
made manager? Sure.

173
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:57,895
A great opportunity
squandered? Absolutely.

174
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:00,648
A crushing blow? Yes.

175
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,150
Will I get over it?

176
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:04,276
Mmm...

177
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:06,612
No.

178
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:09,407
But life goes on.
Not for me.

179
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:12,076
I think with
a little hard work,

180
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:16,038
we can become the greatest
office in the world.

181
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:20,501
And I truly believe that, that's
not an understatement. Okay?

182
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:22,253
Right?

183
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:24,880
Yeah.
Yeah? Yeah? Okay.

184
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,091
That's about it.
That's about it?

185
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,384
Yeah.
There's so much more.

186
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,970
No. This guy is being so modest,

187
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:34,181
there's a lot more to him
than what he just said.

188
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:38,102
We can't wait to learn it all, right, guys?
Again, welcome.

189
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,355
Fantastic.
Thank you so much.

190
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,232
Sir?
Yes.

191
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,317
Thank you very much.

192
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,029
So we talked for
like 20 minutes,

193
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,823
no clue it's Deangelo
the whole time.

194
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:52,283
It's kind of embarrassing.

195
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,492
No, no.

196
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,786
Yeah, that story
makes you sound stupid.

197
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,915
I happen to like the hilarious
high jinks that I get myself into.

198
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,542
There he is, there he is.

199
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,254
Deangelo, I was just telling them
about last night when we met.

200
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,506
Remember that?

201
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:09,550
That was crazy.
That was crazy.

202
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,094
Let's see,
where's my replacement?

203
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:14,889
Where's the guy I'm replacing?
I don't know.

204
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,891
Why don't I look to my left?
I know.

205
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,434
He's sitting right there.
I know.

206
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:22,354
Well, that's what I was
just saying. That's...

207
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,275
That exact situation is why I always
carry around a couple of these.

208
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,735
Just in case,
'cause, you know,

209
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,070
sometimes you need
to ID yourself.

210
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:31,947
Office funny guy.

211
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,867
Always glad to have
an office funny guy around.

212
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:36,994
I wasn't even
trying to make a joke.

213
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:42,541
I guess I've always been sort of
quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.

214
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:47,213
This is Jim and Pam,
a. k.a. Jap.

215
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:51,175
What started as an affair has blossomed
into a family before our eyes.

216
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,094
Well, it wasn't... It wasn't an affair.
Yes, it was.

217
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,804
But, no,
but we are a family.

218
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,138
We made that.

219
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:57,473
- Cecelia.
- Oh!

220
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,892
Congratulations.
Thank you.

221
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,018
I have four kids
of my own.

222
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:02,144
Really?
Yeah.

223
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:06,190
Oh, my gosh, well, we just have
the one, but she poops for four.

224
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:07,483
Uh-oh.

225
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,569
Someone started off on a
good foot with the new boss.

226
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:13,114
Yeah, they don't ever talk
about careers that were made

227
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:16,075
because of unplanned
pregnancies. So...

228
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:20,079
Meredith has shown me her breasts
on three separate occasions.

229
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,039
Really?
There's Dwight. Dwight!

230
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,334
Best right-hand man in the business,
but you better buy a taser

231
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,585
to keep him from
wiping you butt.

232
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:29,213
Hey, Dwight. You had something
to say to Deangelo?

233
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:33,759
"Welcome, new manager
of Dunder Mifflin.

234
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:37,972
"I am Dwight K. Schrute, I am
assistant regional manager.

235
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,558
"I will be at your beck
and call, night and day.

236
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:45,062
"Consider me an extension of your own hand.
I serve at your pleasure.

237
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:48,899
"Congratulations on
joining the staff here.

238
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,734
"This truly is a great day."

239
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,611
The end.

240
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,738
Very nice.
Thank you.

241
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,407
I brought you some cookies.

242
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,159
Oh, Dwight's home baked cookies.
Really, you didn't have to.

243
00:10:58,242 --> 00:10:59,827
These are the best. Lemon
bars or the coconut ones?

244
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,453
I got these at the store.

245
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:05,124
Apparently it's one of the most
popular brands in the United States.

246
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,751
Enjoy.
Chips Ahoy!

247
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:09,003
Okay.

248
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:14,008
Maybe he ran out of yeast,
I don't know.

249
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,636
Maybe syrup? No, not... Well,
maybe syrup. I don't know.

250
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,638
But didn't... Oh, sure, sure.
You can use syrup.

251
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,016
That apple looks delish.

252
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:23,767
I do a lot of
portion control.

253
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,437
Try to keep my daily caloric
intake under 1,200.

254
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,772
Deangelo, you're
going to starve to death.

255
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,692
So you decided to have an orgy
and not invite me?

256
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,235
Come on. I call middle.

257
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,989
That's cool that you like
the southwest.

258
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,866
It's one of my
favorite regions.

259
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:42,953
"It's one of my favorite regions."
Did I just sound totally lame?

260
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:44,955
Oh.

261
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,333
I sounded good.

262
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,920
I love the desert. It's one
of my favorite ecosystems.

263
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:53,172
Here's the great thing
about the southwest,

264
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:55,925
there is so much
more than desert.

265
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:58,135
Along the north rim
of the Grand Canyon

266
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,471
is a forest as lush
as you've ever seen.

267
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,681
Burned. It's lush, dummy.

268
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:06,310
Hey, Deangelo, what do you
think about bald people?

269
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:08,812
I hate them.

270
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:11,398
Deangelo, I forget, did you
mention you liked politics?

271
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:12,441
I did not.

272
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,610
Because I was thinking,
you should meet my boyfriend.

273
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:15,945
He's a state senator.

274
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:19,406
I really think the two of you would hit
it off. He's a great person to know.

275
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,325
Sounds very interesting,
thank you.

276
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,660
Mmm-hmm.

277
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,620
Psst. Thanks for
meeting me.

278
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,704
Are you kidding?

279
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,581
I would come anywhere
to see a turtle. Yeah.

280
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:28,749
Where'd you find him?

281
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,252
There's no turtle, Michael. I
just wanted to get you here.

282
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,255
You know me
very well, Dwight.

283
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:36,548
That's because I'm your
right-hand man, Michael.

284
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,425
But I can't do it.
I can't do it again.

285
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,302
I can't be a right-hand man
to a whole new guy.

286
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:43,013
Now, I'm gonna have to go
online and look at turtles

287
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:44,431
or else I'm gonna
be off the whole day.

288
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,642
I want to be manager.

289
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,270
I have been Robin to your
Batman for 11 years,

290
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,355
11 glorious years, Michael.

291
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:54,692
But at a certain point,
Robin needs to become Batman.

292
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,611
Batman scares me, Dwight.
Let's not talk about Batman.

293
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:00,781
Yeah, well, you know what?
Bats scared Bruce Wayne, too.

294
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,617
That's why he became
Batman. Ha!

295
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:08,622
What are you thinking?

296
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:09,707
Nothing.

297
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,166
Is there a Turtle Man?

298
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,501
No, Michael...

299
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:16,880
I just don't understand why I wasn't
even interviewed for the job.

300
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,299
I mean, what's wrong?

301
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:21,302
I'm totally qualified.
You were pushing for me.

302
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:24,221
I didn't know Dwight
wanted to be manager.

303
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,145
Deangelo. You'll get
a kick out of this.

304
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,646
Do you know those
old school blocks,

305
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,773
the wooden blocks for kids?
Mmm-hmm.

306
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:37,526
Oh, my gosh, yes. Oh, yeah. The
block story. This is great.

307
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,610
Right.
Okay, go ahead.

308
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,446
So, the blocks with the letters on.
. . With the letters.

309
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,488
Yes, right, okay.
Yeah sure, sure, sure.

310
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,032
So we give a set
of those to Cece

311
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:44,575
and we turn around for,
like, a second...

312
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:45,659
A second.
A second.

313
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:50,497
And we turn back, and she has spelled
out the word "Ass" in the blocks.

314
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,292
So we're laughing,
she's grinning...

315
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,793
It was so funny.

316
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:58,172
Kids are a riot. They really
do say the darndest things.

317
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,802
Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin.
Okay, let me transfer you.

318
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,139
Why do you use your name
when you answer the phone?

319
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,350
Oh, that's how Pam does it.
I just copy her.

320
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,435
She's sort of
a living legend.

321
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:14,188
Try it without
using your name.

322
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,482
Dunder Mifflin. This is.

323
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,443
Oh, yeah, I like it.

324
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,987
Dunder Mifflin.
How may I assist you?

325
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:23,572
Oh. "Assist."

326
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:24,698
I sort of like
the old way.

327
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,243
I just prefer it
without the name.

328
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:30,204
And I thought...
Okay. No, no, no.

329
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,164
I've got to start doing some
managing at some point, right?

330
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,166
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
But if it's not a big deal,

331
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,793
we should just do the old way.
And it really isn't.

332
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,544
- Okay. That good?
- Yeah, okay, good.

333
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,546
Well, I'd like to
change it, actually.

334
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,715
Well,
you know, whatever...

335
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,425
Yeah. Whatever you
think would work.

336
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:45,010
What do you...
Yeah.

337
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,720
I think a change
would be nice.

338
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:50,474
You could do the old way or the, you know.
. . Whichever one you want to do.

339
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:51,892
Mmm-hmm.

340
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:55,938
Change it.

341
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:08,742
I'm so sorry. Sorry.

342
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:15,165
Come on, you maggot.

343
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,167
Bye-bye, calories.

344
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,173
Don't stop, now.

345
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,509
No one's stopping me.

346
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,180
All right. Hey.
Okay.

347
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,850
Wow! Look at you.

348
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:34,601
Don't hug me.

349
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:36,770
No! Get away, get away.

350
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,607
I see you've been introduced
to our conference room.

351
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,443
Multi-function room, yeah.

352
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:46,321
So I was thinking that maybe I could
show you around a little bit more?

353
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:48,699
You could shadow me.
Still a lot to learn, so...

354
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,536
Yeah, you know, I'm feeling
like I'm ready to dive in.

355
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,205
Well, the water's pretty cold.
A lot of octopuses out there.

356
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,959
Well, I've been taught by the
best octopus hunter in the biz.

357
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,170
I haven't taught you
everything. There's...

358
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,505
Pretty good teacher. I feel
pretty prepared. Mmm...

359
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:05,757
You know what?
No teacher in the world

360
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,676
could teach this job
in one day.

361
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:09,470
I think you just about did.

362
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:11,305
Well, I don't think I did,
so why...

363
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,683
Wanna go?
You'll shadow me?

364
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:18,896
Let me finish getting dressed.
All right.

365
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,734
Oh, hey, Dwight.
Before I forget,

366
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,320
I would love to know of any
great restaurants in town

367
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,071
if you have any thoughts.

368
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,699
I've got a list here that has
pretty much every place in town.

369
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:31,909
Oh, great.

370
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,289
Just make sure
you get that back to me.

371
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,006
I'll get that,
you guys. Don't...

372
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,174
No, I'll help you. Here.

373
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:48,300
You know, it's just...

374
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,010
You know...

375
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,014
Hi.
Hello. Hi.

376
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:56,725
Have we met before?

377
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:00,103
No, not officially. I saw you
coming out of the bathroom earlier.

378
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,524
Well, I guess I'm gonna
go back to my cave.

379
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,609
Okay. It was really
great meeting you.

380
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,113
And that is what
they call a meet cute.

381
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,122
Hey, funny guy. I have a
little midday lull here.

382
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,500
Make me laugh. Huh?
What do you got?

383
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,001
I can't even look
at you.

384
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,127
Here we go.

385
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,046
Okay...

386
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:31,802
What do African
Americans call the...

387
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,268
What?

388
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:40,561
Deangelo?
Yeah?

389
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:41,645
Did you order a barber?

390
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,522
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on back here.

391
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:46,400
Put a pin on that, okay? I can't
wait to hear the punch line.

392
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:48,944
Finish the joke, Andy.

393
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,446
What do
African Americans call?

394
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,490
I don't know. Help me.

395
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:56,952
That is so bad-ass.

396
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,663
Just so hardcore.

397
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,373
Yeah, very cool.

398
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,666
Real power move.
Yeah.

399
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:08,088
I saw a hawk today.

400
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:10,382
It was just
sitting right there

401
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:13,135
on the overpass,
looking at me.

402
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,764
Shave me.

403
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:23,562
Well, this is going
to be funny.

404
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,689
Because it looks like we're
gonna be shaving buddies.

405
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:29,026
Okay, all right. I love it.
I love it.

406
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,944
Michael, this is Reggie.
Hello.

407
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,613
He is the number one

408
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,948
Yelp-reviewed shaver in Scranton.
It's not even close.

409
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:38,577
And this is Erin, and she's
going to shave my face.

410
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,037
Here we go.

411
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,836
All right.

412
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:50,964
This is how we do it.

413
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:52,174
Mmm.

414
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,258
Feels nice, doesn't it?

415
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:54,676
It really does.

416
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,389
This is luxury.
Here we go.

417
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,312
Okay.
Okay.

418
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,105
Oh, that is nice.

419
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:09,149
You wanted to
talk to us, Deangelo?

420
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:11,860
Oh, yes, yes, please.
Cozy up there.

421
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:14,571
I just thought we could have some
rap sessions with smaller groups.

422
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,949
You know, we don't really do rap
sessions, we kind of do... God!

423
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,161
We sort of do more of like
powwows and what-ups.

424
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:22,871
Okay, well,
powwows, then. Fine.

425
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,206
That's...

426
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,250
Hey, Deangelo, my mom just
sent me this picture of Cece.

427
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,377
It is so adorable.

428
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,045
All right, wait, but a
little bit of back story.

429
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,505
She loves dogs,
she calls them dadas...

430
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:32,673
Dadas.

431
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,299
...and what happens is...
You know what?

432
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:36,593
Enough about
your baby, okay?

433
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:38,804
I'm sorry.

434
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,514
Well, we were just... I think
she was just trying to...

435
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,642
No, no, no, I know what you're doing.
Just quit it.

436
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:48,188
I want to hear from
the rank and file.

437
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:51,149
How can I be the best
manager for you all?

438
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,901
You know,
what can I do better?

439
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,820
Okay, you know
what, everybody?

440
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,447
There's... You have
to be honest here.

441
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:01,410
You can't say that everything
is perfect, right?

442
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:04,705
So, you know,
come up with something.

443
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:07,624
Well, Deangelo, I'd say
communication could be improved.

444
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,210
People stopped
reading memos.

445
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:11,712
So everyone
marks them urgent.

446
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:14,131
Okay, you know what?
I mark it urgent "A,"

447
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,508
urgent "B,"
urgent "C," urgent "D."

448
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:18,468
Urgent "A" is
the most important,

449
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:21,972
urgent "D" you don't even
really have to worry about.

450
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,558
Okay, Michael, can you stop talking now?
I have to do your lips.

451
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:26,476
Don't shave my lips.

452
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,979
How about you, Dwight?

453
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:34,568
Uh, yeah, I'm just right
by your side, so... Yeah.

454
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:38,488
Personally, Deangelo, I just want
to sit and see how you do things.

455
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:39,740
I'm really excited.

456
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:42,617
There must be something you'd like
to see, specifically, improved.

457
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:45,704
I do think that there is a web
of racism and/or jealousy

458
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,789
that is trying
to keep me down.

459
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,084
Okay. Well,
this has been very helpful.

460
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,587
This is a great start.
Props to you.

461
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,008
Deangelo's great.
I love the guy.

462
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:01,344
But I'm not sure he's
a good fit for the office.

463
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,598
And also, I'm not sure
if I love the guy.

464
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,475
Did we just totally blow it?

465
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:10,729
I don't know. I mean, I get that talking
about your kid can be annoying.

466
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,982
You know, everybody thinks their
kid is the cutest in the world.

467
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,776
Cece really is.
Right?

468
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,360
Yeah.

469
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,156
We just got to
get her in here.

470
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:24,826
What's up?

471
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,745
I don't mean to go off
on a rant here, but...

472
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:31,166
I wrote the perfect joke.
Topical, edgy, funny.

473
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,962
I saw this thing in the news.
Democrats want electric cars.

474
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,881
Republicans don't.
Right.

475
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,966
I'm thinking,
how crazy is it

476
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,929
that we got a car debate going
on in a city known for gridlock.

477
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:47,933
Um... Let's not talk politics
in the office, okay?

478
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:50,560
I like you better
as the funny guy.

479
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:53,688
I wasn't taking a position. It was
just sort of one of those things.

480
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:06,159
Now that's funny.
That's funny.

481
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,619
You walk much?

482
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,788
Yeah, right? I mean...

483
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,294
A little click.
Mmm-hmm.

484
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,173
Deangelo, this box
came for you.

485
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:21,383
Great, thank you.

486
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,594
That's my stuff. Yeah.

487
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,721
Michael, take a look
at this.

488
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,640
Need a hand? Oh, that'd be great.
Thank you.

489
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,016
Hey, you know what?
This office sort of

490
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,477
has a perfect
fung shooey to it, and...

491
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,940
You know, let's not go overboard
with the redecorating.

492
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,650
And I'm still here, so... Wow.

493
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:39,818
Right?
Ooh.

494
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:40,902
That's nice.

495
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,280
I still have to look
at this stuff, guys, so...

496
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,532
Oh, man. So this is
a 10-gallon hat?

497
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,200
Yeah, you like that?
10-gallon hat.

498
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:49,786
Technically, it only
holds about 3 quarts.

499
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:51,788
A little factoid.
Interesting.

500
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,708
No! No, I've always
loved the southwest.

501
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,877
I got a lot of
this stuff at home.

502
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,881
You know, turquoise and rocks.

503
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:03,258
I need this job, man.

504
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,303
I love this. I love change.

505
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,430
Change is good,
and you know what?

506
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:11,433
I think right now, I'm going
to change this supermodel

507
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,226
back into Kevin Malone.

508
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:14,853
Oh! There he is.

509
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:16,313
Oh, my God!

510
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:25,155
All right, this was just...
It was just awful.

511
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:30,243
Thank you, Michael. You're welcome.
That's better.

512
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,498
Cool, cool.

513
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,292
All right,
see you later, girl.

514
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,543
Hey, hey, hey.

515
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,838
No, I'm good. Keep that.

516
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:47,510
Hey, funny man. What you got for me?
Make me laugh.

517
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:08,740
Let's see if
my favorite tea is in...

518
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:10,200
Whoa! Jeez.

519
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:28,093
That's hot coffee.

520
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,221
Drink some soap.

521
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,140
Eat some hand soap.

522
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:44,067
I guess this is my life now.

523
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:46,987
Can you believe that?

524
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:50,699
They're all treating him
like he's some sort of god.

525
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:53,827
You know, they used to say that
I was the world's best boss.

526
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:55,954
Now you're a lame duck.

527
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,747
Yeah, well,
you're a retarded owl.

528
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,417
And Deangelo is a fat cow.

529
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:04,254
He has the same body type that you have.
You're like body twins.

530
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,798
I guess I mean just
from how he used to be.

531
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,425
What do you mean?

532
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,970
I have just come into
the possession of a photograph

533
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:16,683
that is very embarrassing,
and just may change the way

534
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,769
you perceive a certain
person in this office.

535
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,062
What is it?

536
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,857
It's a picture of
a super fat guy.

537
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,275
Yes.

538
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,693
I'll say.

539
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:28,069
It's Deangelo.

540
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:29,320
Yes, it is.

541
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,325
This is a photograph taken
of Deangelo Vickers.

542
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:36,911
I just... I can't get that
picture out of my head.

543
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:41,833
This curly-haired
idiot used to be so fat.

544
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:46,713
It really is a shame that a person's
weight, or their former weight,

545
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:49,007
makes us think less of them.

546
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:51,843
How do you let
yourself go like that?

547
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:52,886
I don't know.

548
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:56,514
I know, Michael. Right? Just
jog in place 10 seconds a day.

549
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:57,724
That's all it takes.

550
00:25:57,849 --> 00:25:58,975
I know. That's...

551
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:01,144
I didn't have
10 seconds a day.

552
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:03,980
I was too busy eating.

553
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,068
That's okay.
Pass it around.

554
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:10,862
Let everyone take a look. Creed,
have you looked at it yet?

555
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,405
Yes, but I'll gladly
look again.

556
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:16,659
I used to weigh 425 pounds.

557
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,621
I was unhappy and unhealthy.

558
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,831
Used to go to
tapas restaurants

559
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:24,167
and gorge myself on
Spanish charcuterie.

560
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,711
I mean, let's be honest.

561
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:29,839
Tapas is a cuisine for groups.
Not with me.

562
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,633
Tapas party of one.

563
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:35,261
Looks like you went
over the tapas with food.

564
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:39,599
One day, I had
a long layover in Phoenix.

565
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:42,102
I thought I'd do some sightseeing
and my car broke down in Sedona.

566
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:45,563
I found myself just wandering,
delirious with hunger.

567
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:49,943
And I swear to God,
I felt an energy.

568
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:55,615
I felt stronger than I'd ever felt
before, like I could do anything.

569
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,659
Keep in mind, I was naked.

570
00:26:57,742 --> 00:27:00,286
But in that moment,
I felt like I could change,

571
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:04,541
and I made a promise that I would
lose 202 pounds within a year.

572
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:07,752
I just... I can't get that image out
of my head, of what you used to...

573
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,671
Michael, stop, please.
...look like. It just...

574
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:12,340
My friends, my new family,

575
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:16,594
I stand here today...
Guess how much weight I lost.

576
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,471
Two hundred and two pounds?

577
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:23,601
203. I beat it by one.
I beat it by one.

578
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:26,062
Beat it by one.

579
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:30,150
And that is why
I so firmly believe

580
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:36,698
that this extraordinary group
of people that I'm looking at

581
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:39,951
has a chance,
has an opportunity,

582
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:42,453
to become the greatest
office in the world.

583
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,457
Because we can change anything we want.
I'm living proof.

584
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,084
You know what?
He's right.

585
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:53,047
If he can lose all that weight,
then I can wear fake hair.

586
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,675
Thank for sharing,
Deangelo. Amazing.

587
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:56,843
Thank you.

588
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:07,562
And thank me
for bringing it up.

589
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,233
How do I become
a manager at Sabre?

590
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,319
Well, first things first,

591
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:16,279
thank you for coming
to me directly, you know.

592
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:17,822
I know you could
have called Tallahassee,

593
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:19,824
but they would have
just looped back to me.

594
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:21,284
So it's cool you
recognized my role here.

595
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,619
I left a message
at corporate.

596
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:24,412
There you go.

597
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:26,331
Get a recommendation
from Michael.

598
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:28,249
That'll put you
right on the short list

599
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,626
for next time
there's an opening.

600
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:32,170
Can't you just use the recommendation
you already have on file?

601
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:34,172
What recommendation?

602
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:36,299
From when he recommended
me to replace him.

603
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:40,845
Um...

604
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:44,349
I'm sorry.
I never know how to act

605
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,643
in these awkward
type situations.

606
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:50,188
Best whale watching?
Easily the West Coast.

607
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:51,731
If you're gonna go whale
watching on the East Coast,

608
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:54,859
you might want to bring a magazine
called West Coast Whales.

609
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:57,153
Because
you're not gonna see any.

610
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,907
Snack time! It's the
witching hour. It is the sandwiching hour.

611
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,075
Awesome.

612
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,159
Hmm. What you got?

613
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:05,078
PB and J . My mom's recipe.

614
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:07,288
Michael, Deangelo
has a peanut allergy.

615
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,582
Okay, I need a wide berth. I need
a wide berth from those nuts.

616
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:11,709
Michael, what are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

617
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:14,170
I think Kevin wants one.
Kevin, here you go.

618
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,090
Michael,
this is serious.

619
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,925
Do you know what happens
if Deangelo touches a peanut?

620
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:20,051
What?

621
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:22,303
Michael, the last time
I was exposed to a peanut,

622
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:24,597
I was itchy for
three days, okay?

623
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:27,725
I had to take baths constantly.
I missed the O.J . verdict.

624
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:29,435
Had to read about it in
the paper like an idiot.

625
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,522
Wait, so you don't go into,
like, shock or die or anything?

626
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:36,359
No, Jim. Not everything's life and death.
I want to feel comfortable.

627
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,486
Oscar, here you go.

628
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:40,029
Oh! Whoa!

629
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:42,323
You're getting nut
particles all in the air.

630
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:45,868
No one had a problem with the
air here until you came around.

631
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,630
Everyone, mandatory meeting.
Multi-purpose room, now.

632
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:59,048
No, that's good.
You just stay in there.

633
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,675
Except for Michael. Stay in
there by yourself, loser.

634
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:02,802
Nobody go in. Nobody go in there.
What?

635
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:04,304
Why?
Just stay where you are.

636
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:05,638
Michael, this is insane.

637
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:07,015
No, it's not
insane, Oscar.

638
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:09,017
I've been here
for 19 years,

639
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,810
and just because someone
else is called the boss,

640
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:12,228
you're gonna throw
it all away? No, no.

641
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,153
Listen, you're the one
who decided to leave.

642
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:22,864
Come on, he's our new boss.
You know we have to do this.

643
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:24,449
Okay.

644
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:28,036
Well, who needs them?

645
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,412
Looks like it's just
you and me, Dwight.

646
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,749
Correction.
Just you.

647
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:38,921
All right. Meeting,
multi-function room.

648
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:41,215
Apology accepted.

649
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:43,926
Hold on.

650
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:49,390
Hey, Michael. Michael,
wait up, hold up. Hold up.

651
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:51,726
Um...

652
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,062
So, for these meetings,

653
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:56,064
do you just jump
into business

654
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:58,024
or do you start
with some chitchat or...

655
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:02,904
I start with some chitchat
and maybe a couple of jokes.

656
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,783
And you might want to develop
a couple of characters.

657
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:09,410
You know what? You just.
. . You'll be fine.

658
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:12,455
Maybe, maybe not. 50-50.

659
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:17,210
You know, it is too bad for
this place that you're leaving.

660
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,925
Bring it in. Come on.

661
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,471
Bring it.

662
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:32,975
Okay. Okay.

663
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,699
Why did you have
to be so damn good?

664
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:51,786
I... I'm adequate.

665
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:55,164
I'm half as good as you.

666
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:56,999
No, no, no.
Come on.

667
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,961
You are good. They know it.
Come on.

668
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:04,048
I just didn't expect you
to get there so fast.

669
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,635
Would you do me a favor and enjoy
this time, okay? You've worked so hard.

670
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:10,847
Get your senioritis on.
It's Lake Havasu time.

671
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:13,433
I guess I've been
working so hard

672
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:15,643
I forgot what it's like
to be hardly working.

673
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,233
Okay.

674
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:29,657
What is the Native
American girl's name?

675
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:31,492
You'll figure it out.

676
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:42,628
Thank you, Dwight.

677
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:43,921
Thank you, sir.

678
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:48,885
Listen up...

679
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,310
Hey, Deangelo.
Want to meet Cece?

680
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:06,652
That's a cute baby.

681
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:09,322
Very cute baby.
Adorable. Very cute.

682
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:10,740
Thank you very much.

683
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:13,326
I'm sorry, I should
get back to work, but...

684
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:14,911
Yeah, absolutely. Okay.
Absolutely, yeah.

685
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:16,078
Thank you so much.
