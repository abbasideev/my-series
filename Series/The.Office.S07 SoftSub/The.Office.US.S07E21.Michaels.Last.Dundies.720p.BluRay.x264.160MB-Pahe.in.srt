1
00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:05,366
It is 6:00 a.m., and Deangelo and
I are about to go house to house

2
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:08,068
to give everybody their Dundies
nomination certificate.

3
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,973
Just like the Oscars.
Yes.

4
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,602
And this happens every year?

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,544
Every year this happens.
Okay. Every year.

6
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,708
You have a lot
to learn, my friend.

7
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,481
Well, you know,
why don't we try it,

8
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:21,112
and if it goes good,
it'll be part of my tradition.

9
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,817
Why are you even saying that?
You're going to love it.

10
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,287
Here we go.

11
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,589
This way, this way.

12
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:33,960
Okay.
Nice house.

13
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,194
Surprise!
Congratulations!

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,363
Yep.

15
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:41,369
You and Pam have both been
nominated for Dundie Awards.

16
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:42,598
Okay.

17
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,439
Here we go.

18
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,241
Have Pam come down.
No, no, she's not here.

19
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,437
What's going on?

20
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:48,605
Stay in bed.

21
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,578
Congratulations!
Stanley, we love you.

22
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:54,678
Have you lost your mind? Get off my
property before I call the police.

23
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,589
All right, we got it. Good.
Okay.

24
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:58,681
Leave it at the door? Okay.

25
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,783
Yeah, that's fine.

26
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,967
Hey, Toby, you suck!

27
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,099
Is this an employee of ours?

28
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,335
Why are...
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

29
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,141
I've never seen this
place in the daylight.

30
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,610
This reminds me
of Katrina.

31
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,015
Here we go.
All right.

32
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,452
Got it? Are we set? Hello?

33
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,413
Oh.
Uh-oh.

34
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,925
I'm so busted. Walk of shame.

35
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,928
Do you usually leave your door unlocked?
And ajar?

36
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,659
Nice. I got
a Dundie nomination. Wow.

37
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,292
Yes, that's right.
Yes, you did.

38
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,337
No big deal.
Congratulations, Meredith.

39
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,803
Well, we should head out.

40
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,066
No, no, no,
you've got to stay.

41
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,836
No, no, no, I have Vienna
sausages and I have napkins.

42
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,878
Let me fix you breakfast.

43
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,713
I'm not going in there.

44
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,974
Go.

45
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,326
Good morning, Erin.

46
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,595
Oh, hey, didn't see you.

47
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,031
Any big plans for tonight?

48
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:18,163
I don't know.

49
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:21,231
Maybe volunteer at the
women's shelter, go to bed.

50
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,000
Or, I don't know,

51
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:26,242
maybe I'm going
to the Dundies!

52
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,713
You are getting
so funny. Very good.

53
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,586
The Dundies are my baby,
and they need to go on.

54
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,359
When Larry King died, they
didn't just cancel his show.

55
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,887
They got Pierce Morgan
to come in and do his show,

56
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:48,026
and that way, Larry lives on.

57
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,696
Anything can happen
at the Dundies.

58
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,173
They're like the Golden
Globes, but less mean.

59
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,209
And I just want us to
all have a good time.

60
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,644
Just a little
announcement, folks.

61
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,182
Remember, the Dundies
is a black tie affair.

62
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,016
Black tie optional.

63
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,352
Every day is
black tie optional.

64
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,084
FYI, tonight we will
be hosting at Louie Volpe's.

65
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,750
Nice.
I love their breadsticks.

66
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,418
Oh, their breadsticks
are like crack.

67
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,119
I love when
people say "like crack"

68
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,823
who've obviously
never done crack.

69
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,931
Well, the breadsticks
are like what then, Ryan?

70
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,900
What can I use? I don't know.
Something from your world.

71
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,526
"The breadsticks are
like scrapbooking."

72
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,798
You're right, you're right.
No, I'm a middle-class fraud.

73
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,430
Shh.
Okay, okay, okay.

74
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,806
Everybody's right. They're
like breadsticks on steroids.

75
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,435
Right?
Yeah, that's great.

76
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,738
So, as you know,
the Dundies are my legacy,

77
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,544
so I'm going to need
to train a replacement.

78
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,278
So this year, I have
decided to have a co-host.

79
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,748
And that person is

80
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,082
Deangelo!

81
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:49,422
Always the Padawan,
never the Jedi.

82
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:53,494
Thank you, Michael.
Uh, but I will have to pass.

83
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,062
Think of it as
part of your training.

84
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,570
I'm not much
of a performer.

85
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,265
Unless you count
singing in the shower.

86
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,909
Boy, okay.

87
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,309
Okay, well, we'll work on it.

88
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,673
Look,
I'm very, very bad.

89
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,216
Very bad.
You are doing it.

90
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,808
Guys, I want you to help us
work on some banter.

91
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,850
Yes! I love banter.

92
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,910
Good.

93
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,184
- But I hate witty banter.
- Here we go.

94
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:21,525
So, Deangelo, you and I
have a lot in common.

95
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,893
You lost 200 pounds, and I lose
my car keys every morning.

96
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,195
That is true. We do
share some similarities.

97
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,933
I know how we can fix
one of those problems.

98
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,338
For me, it was
portion control.

99
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,239
For you, you need a keychain.

100
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,869
Maybe hang them on the...
Okay, okay, you know what?

101
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,379
I didn't actually
lose my keys.

102
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:41,671
Okay, so this
did not happen.

103
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:42,839
M'kay.

104
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,045
There needs to be
what you call a "rat-tat-tat."

105
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,678
And right now,
it's all "rat" and no "tat."

106
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:49,848
Ryan, come on up here.

107
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,516
Deangelo, if you'd just...
Do you mind?

108
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,526
Tap Deangelo out.
Because if I can see it.

109
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:54,788
Just watch this. Okay.

110
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:56,957
Ryan, how are you today?

111
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,191
Why don't you
ask my therapist?

112
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,526
My mom certainly
pays her enough.

113
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,000
There you go! Lovely!

114
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,500
Regis and Kelly. Nice.

115
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:07,166
Use that as an inspiration.
Just be funny.

116
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,434
Uh... You, sir.
Are we having fun tonight?

117
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,270
Having a great time. Thanks, yeah.
Oh, good.

118
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,908
Where were you
on September 11th?

119
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,040
No, gosh. No, no.

120
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:18,081
- Stop, stop.
- This is so weird.

121
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,450
If I'm conducting a meeting,
good to go.

122
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,786
But if I think of it as a
performance, I fall apart, obviously.

123
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,649
Why don't you think
of hosting the Dundies

124
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,317
like you're just
running a meeting?

125
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:30,489
No, no, no, this is
the performance of your life.

126
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,723
Why don't you just privately, in your
own head, think of it like a meeting?

127
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,927
Jim, please, no loopholes.

128
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,334
Mike, why do you
have to control

129
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,802
how he perceives
it in his mind?

130
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,931
This is my last Dundies ever.

131
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,944
If I want mind control over
him, is that too much to ask?

132
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,811
Good. Good, good. Good.

133
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,513
Now, tell me
something terrible

134
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:54,782
that happened in
your childhood.

135
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,984
When I was very young,
my mother divorced my father

136
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,289
and I had to go to court
and choose between them.

137
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,227
Too personal. I don't want
to hear about that stuff.

138
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,821
Let's try this. Put this on.

139
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:10,661
I am going to turn this on and
turn the volume all the way up,

140
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,005
so you can't... That's right, you're
not going to be able to hear yourself.

141
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,840
Read this, and it's
going to sound perfect.

142
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:21,313
"The Dundies are all
about coming together,

143
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:26,376
"and recognizing the indomitability
of the human spirit!"

144
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:27,978
Say it with an accent!

145
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,646
The Dundies!

146
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,825
"The Dundies!"
The Dundies!

147
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,360
I just don't
understand the desire

148
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,961
to push sweet
potato fries on me.

149
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,052
I just want regular fries.

150
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,119
Yeah.

151
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,520
Oh!

152
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,061
Hey, Erin,
everything okay?

153
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:43,670
Get away from the car,
or he's going to see you.

154
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,066
Who's going to see us?

155
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,434
Just get in.
Get in. Just get in.

156
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,734
Get in the car?

157
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,905
Please, sorry,
get in.

158
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,311
I'm sorry,
sorry, sorry.

159
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,644
What's wrong?

160
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,283
I eat lunch in the car now.
It's my alone time.

161
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,714
It's just nice to have
some time away from Gabe.

162
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,989
Why don't you want to each
lunch with your boyfriend?

163
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,788
I really don't like
spending time with him.

164
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,429
Don't you think it's better
to tell him the truth now?

165
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,860
You know, rather than
waste more of his time?

166
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,701
I think I'm going to go.
What?

167
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,399
I think you got this.
Okay.

168
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,065
Okay? All right.
Yeah.

169
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,837
Okay. Thank you, Jim.
Feel better.

170
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:26,646
I'm sorry, that just
wasn't interesting to me.

171
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,510
I can't just dump him, Pam.
I'm not like you.

172
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,915
I can't be mean.

173
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,248
Wait, when am I...

174
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,013
You just have to be
clear and firm, you know.

175
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,549
Just tell him you don't love him.
Just be honest with him.

176
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,929
Hi.
Appalling.

177
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,425
Eyesore.

178
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,893
Surprisingly adequate.

179
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:55,803
Okay, everyone, the festivities
commence in four seconds!

180
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,771
Deangelo,
Jo's on the phone for you.

181
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,806
Hello?

182
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,475
Deangelo, we're in
serious horse manure here.

183
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,076
The Dundies are tonight,
and we ain't got no host.

184
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,652
Oh, no.

185
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,622
Luckily, I have
someone for you.

186
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,117
Billy Crystal?
Better.

187
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,483
Neil Patrick Harris?

188
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,824
He's in Little Shop
of Horrors on Broadway.

189
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,726
Right. No, we need
Michael Scott,

190
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:20,665
the best darn Dundies host
both sides of the Mississippi.

191
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,967
I've got to
find Michael Scott.

192
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:29,603
And then I've got to
get him to the Dundies.

193
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,804
Hey, can you help me
find Michael Scott, Angela?

194
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,712
My boyfriend can.
He's a state senator.

195
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:37,807
Mmm-hmm.

196
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:41,150
Oh, no, he can't help because
that title has no meaning.

197
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,219
Try Jim, Deangelo.
He'll be able to help.

198
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,519
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

199
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,861
Jim, do you know where I
can find Michael Scott?

200
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,754
Oh, I totally don't know
where Michael is, dude.

201
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,926
Hey, you want to
listen to some records?

202
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,668
No one's listening to me.
I'm running out of time.

203
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,935
Well, what are you
talking about?

204
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,143
I've fallen
and I can't get up.

205
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,944
Maybe I just need to
look into my heart.

206
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,145
Deangelo,
where is Michael Scott?

207
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,848
I'm here.
In a good way.

208
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,288
I've been here
the whole time.

209
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:21,923
The analytical part of
me wants to examine it.

210
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,793
But I know it has no content.

211
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,057
Ladies and gentlemen,
please stand up

212
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,828
for your
co-host of the evening,

213
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,267
Michael Gary Scott!

214
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:37,072
Please remain standing for your
other co-host and new manager,

215
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:42,172
Deangelo Jeremetrius Vickers!

216
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,021
Is that part of the...

217
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,657
Deangelo. Hey.

218
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,331
Deangelo, what are you doing?
There's a live audience out there.

219
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,768
Just go do it by yourself,
or get Ryan.

220
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,032
No, Ryan would never do it.
It's too on the radar.

221
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:11,442
Look, look, the boss hosts the Dundies.
It's sort of our perk.

222
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:14,241
This was not part of
the job description.

223
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,406
Okay, listen to me.

224
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,610
You're not doing this for me,
you're not doing this for you.

225
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,118
You're not even
doing this for them.

226
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,177
What am I doing it for?

227
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,351
You're doing it for
all those kids out there

228
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,220
eating off
the Louie Volpe's kids menu

229
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,260
who are wondering,
"Does it get better?"

230
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,719
What I want you to do is,
I want you to say,

231
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,889
"It's show time."
And get out there.

232
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,257
I can't.
Say it.

233
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:36,834
Stop hitting me.

234
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,235
You can do it,
just say it.

235
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,165
Hit me again.

236
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,967
Now hit me.

237
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:44,970
One, two, three...

238
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,068
It's show time!
It's show time!

239
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,240
All right, here we go.

240
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,411
Okay, okay, sorry about
the delay, everybody,

241
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,788
but we were at
the DMV waiting in line.

242
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,756
Fall asleep right after sex.
Huh, guys?

243
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,963
Nope, go back to the script.

244
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,229
There are a lot of great
salesmen in this office,

245
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:13,396
but one of our great salesmen
is also a great dad,

246
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,899
and a close
personal friend of mine.

247
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:19,104
Jim Halpert, Best Dad Dundie.

248
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,051
Wow, I do not
parent for the awards,

249
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,121
but I got to tell you,
it feels pretty good.

250
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:31,523
Cece, if you're watching this at
home, it's way past your bedtime.

251
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:34,584
By the way, how'd this get televised?
Thanks.

252
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:35,856
Well done.

253
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,192
I don't know,
maybe being a good dad

254
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,593
is just following
your own compass.

255
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,861
I don't know, I don't know.
Thank you. Okay.

256
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,160
Didn't think to
mention me, huh?

257
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,228
Didn't I?

258
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,876
Which moves us to
Best Mom Dundie.

259
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,012
This person, well,
I guess we all sort of

260
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,137
consider a mom
around the office,

261
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,512
Meredith Palmer!

262
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,582
Oh, my God!

263
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,118
Say what?

264
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,527
I'll tell you one thing, I'm not
going to be a good mom tonight.

265
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:08,687
Whoo!

266
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,993
Excuse me, can I get a photo of the
best mom and the best dad, please?

267
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:13,991
Step on up.

268
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,057
I've got to go do this.

269
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,124
Why?

270
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,072
Let's go, big smiles, folks.
There they are.

271
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:22,631
Year after year, I catch a lot
of flak on this particular award

272
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:26,737
because year after year, I present
this award to a guy instead of a girl.

273
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:31,148
Hottest in the Office
goes to Danny Cordray!

274
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,785
Danny could not
be here tonight...

275
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,287
How do I feel
about not winning

276
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,889
Hottest in
the Office this year?

277
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,754
Um, I'm very relieved.

278
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,954
How do you judge something like...
What is his criteria, even?

279
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,018
It's...

280
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,857
It's so subjective.

281
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:48,299
Stanley Hudson is a grump,
everybody knows that.

282
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,935
But did you know
that Stanley Hudson

283
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,497
is also the face of a debilitating
disease known as diabetes?

284
00:12:56,476 --> 00:13:00,072
The Diabetes Award
goes to Stanley Hudson!

285
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:03,180
Come on up here,
you sick bastard.

286
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:09,354
I have diabetes, too. You don't see
me making a big deal about it.

287
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,955
They say he's going to be
my right-hand man,

288
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,928
ad-lib masturbation joke. No.

289
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,557
I hate this.
I hate it so much.

290
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:23,331
Dwight Schrute, please accept this
Promising Assistant Manager Dundie.

291
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:29,007
Thank you, thanks so much. Um,
I want to dedicate this award

292
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:33,240
to something that, uh, we take
for granted in our daily lives,

293
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,872
and that is
the humble trash can.

294
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,342
This is for you, trash can.

295
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,155
Who gave you those crayons?

296
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,023
I brought them from home.

297
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,389
Do you have a red?

298
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,758
This is a cloth tablecloth.

299
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,264
You can't color on it.

300
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,227
Oh, really?

301
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:59,806
Did you know herpes affects one out
of every five sexually active adults?

302
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,273
Pippi Longstocking,

303
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,109
Ronald McDonald's wife,
Ron Howard, Ron Weasley.

304
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,580
What do they all have
in common? Redheads.

305
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,444
And, Erin Hannon,

306
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,415
come on up here to receive your
Cutest Redhead in the Office award.

307
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,413
That is bull.

308
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,359
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

309
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,496
This is the first award I've
ever won in my entire life.

310
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,595
People were right about the
Dundies, they are magical.

311
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,437
But I don't feel it,

312
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:38,569
and I think that's because
I'm not with the right person.

313
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,240
Gabe...

314
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,070
What?

315
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,138
We should break up.

316
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,210
What?

317
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,044
I'm not attracted to you.

318
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,686
I just...
I cringe when you talk.

319
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,618
I have to be honest.

320
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,219
Right, Pam?

321
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,730
Thank you for hearing me.

322
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,938
Okay, well,
this is embarrassing.

323
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,100
Obviously
really angry at Erin.

324
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:12,407
Here comes that quarter-life
crisis everyone's talking about.

325
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,648
All right, I'm gonna go.

326
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,786
Let's... There you go.

327
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:22,853
Damn, that was cold.

328
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,753
It is difficult to recognize the
person who will be replacing you.

329
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:29,926
But he is a good guy,

330
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:34,366
so the Michael Scott Award
for Best Dundies Host

331
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,331
goes to Deangelo Vickers.

332
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,767
Speech, speech, speech...

333
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:46,835
Speech, speech, speech...

334
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,546
Hold on, hold on one second.

335
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,217
Crank it.

336
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:01,591
I want to... I feel truly blessed
to be working with all of you.

337
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:04,529
You know, before this all
started, funny story,

338
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:08,534
I was in the bathroom, vomiting
and vomiting in that men's room.

339
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,331
Okay. That's why it
has been shut down...

340
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:11,598
That's it.
...for most of the evening.

341
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,663
This is important.
He's expressing himself.

342
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:14,934
Hosts don't get Dundies.
No.

343
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,067
This is truly special for me,

344
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,409
and, anyway,
it's so much lighter.

345
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,381
Okay, we're done. That's it.
What?

346
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,677
Michael, are we... What?

347
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:24,910
We're done, we're done.

348
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:30,920
So, that is how it ends.
My last Dundies ever.

349
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:36,561
I was hoping it would be
more like Godfather III,

350
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:39,064
that wrapped up
the whole franchise

351
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,667
in an extremely
satisfying way,

352
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,961
but instead,
it is like Godfather I,

353
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,573
that was very confusing,

354
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,042
had maybe three big laughs.

355
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,105
Oh, well.

356
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,204
Hey, Michael?

357
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,216
We were thinking maybe we
could keep this thing going.

358
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,247
What?

359
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,615
I know I'm the cause
of this royal screwup,

360
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,246
but I would like to
see the show go on.

361
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,291
No, don't. You're
being too hard on yourself.

362
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,416
We had a very
truncated rehearsal time.

363
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,359
Let's grab some
ice cream, go back

364
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,226
to the office,
and finish what we started.

365
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,924
So what you're saying is,
you kind of liked it?

366
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,525
"I've fallen,
and I can't get up."

367
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,366
That Phyllis bit.
That was pretty good, right?

368
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,429
I don't know that we need to dissect
it all right now, but it...

369
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,667
That got a big laugh.
It did.

370
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,266
That actually got a big laugh.
Pretty huge laugh.

371
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,004
You were laughing, right?
I was.

372
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,612
Oh, you know what?
I have to go to the bathroom.

373
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,739
Don't worry,
we're really close.

374
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,749
Really, you know, I can just run
over to the gas station there.

375
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,011
We should just
wait here and not get

376
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,380
good seats in
the conference room?

377
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,216
That's true, we
wouldn't get seats together.

378
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,649
Okay, yeah, I'll hold it.
I'm fine.

379
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,455
You know, despite a couple of hiccups,
I thought that went very well.

380
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,429
I thought it was the worst
Dundies I've ever been to.

381
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:48,034
Man! Maybe you should have won
the Kind of a Bitch Award.

382
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:53,162
Gladly. I'd accept that award,
because a bitch is a female dog.

383
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,399
What? What are you doing? Aah!

384
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:57,499
What...
Ooh!

385
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:01,012
Please don't stop so suddenly.
Seatbelt's pressing on my bladder.

386
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,443
Why are you even
wearing a seatbelt?

387
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:03,847
You're sitting in
the backseat, baby.

388
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,975
What is your problem?

389
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:07,384
I just don't see the point
of the Dundies, okay?

390
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,150
The jokes are terrible, the venue
was bad, the fashion was boring.

391
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:14,489
Okay, that is unfair. The
clothing was safe but tasteful.

392
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,720
And next time,
why don't you pick a co-host

393
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,922
that doesn't have
microphone-a-phobia?

394
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,830
Look, whatever
you're going to do,

395
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,799
how long is it
going to take, ballpark?

396
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,337
Because I just... I've got
to make a decision here.

397
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,640
He is in
an all-out sprint.

398
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,407
...better than before.

399
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,209
Please, excuse me.

400
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,648
Here... Okay.

401
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,710
By his own admission,
this person

402
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,845
actually tried
marijuana in college,

403
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:47,287
so the Doobie Doobie Pothead
Stoner of the Year Award

404
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,920
goes to Andy Bernard!

405
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,023
Yes.

406
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,288
Ohhh!

407
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,458
There's a lot of
people I'd like to thank,

408
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,003
but I think we all actually
want to thank you, Michael.

409
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,139
Oh! Thank you.

410
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:03,802
I mean, we actually really all
want to thank you for everything.

411
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,878
Oh, my God.
Something's happening.

412
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,513
9,986,000 minutes

413
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,555
We actually sat
down and did the math

414
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,795
9,986,000 minutes

415
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,296
That's how many minutes
that you've worked here

416
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,760
In costumes

417
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,827
And impressions

418
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,401
In meetings

419
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,769
In cups of coffee

420
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,032
For birthdays

421
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,200
More meetings and...

422
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,439
E-mail forwards
you made us read

423
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,079
9,986,000 minutes

424
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:49,578
That's like watching
Die Hard 80,000 times

425
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,953
You hit me with your car

426
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:54,322
You helped me get off drugs

427
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,755
I watch you when you sleep

428
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,764
I forgive you for kissing me

429
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:02,127
Remember to call

430
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,203
You've got to remember to call

431
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,830
Remember to call

432
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,338
Love is a gift from up above

433
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,138
Remember to call

434
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,009
Text or call or e-mail or call

435
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:20,745
Measure,
measure your life in love

436
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,588
Remember to call

437
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,125
Yeah, yeah, yeah

438
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,185
Remember to call

439
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,425
Yeah, yeah, you've
got to remember to call

440
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:35,662
Remember to call

441
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:41,197
Yeah, okay.

442
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,539
Well, this is going to
hurt like a mother.

443
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,177
Every day,
millions of Americans

444
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,046
suffer from
extreme repulsiveness.

445
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:55,680
Someone in our midst is
bringing that problem to light.

446
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,917
Toby Flenderson,
please come up here

447
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,118
and accept the Extreme
Repulsiveness Award.

448
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,216
Oh, that's so mean.

449
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,283
No, it's fine.

450
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,654
It's his last Dundies.

451
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:04,923
You got to play along, man.

452
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,228
Come on, Toby.

453
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,528
Here he comes!

454
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:11,534
All right, you deserved it.

455
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:15,132
I really disagree with this.
I think it's kind of hateful.

456
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,798
Although,
I am a little happy right now

457
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,175
to have a platform to talk
about the outcome of a case

458
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:21,646
that I was recently a juror
on, the Scranton Strangler.

459
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:25,478
A man's being put to death,
I was part of the verdict,

460
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,645
and I'm not so sure
he's guilty anymore.
