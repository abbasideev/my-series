1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,858
Mmm.

2
00:00:08,372 --> 00:00:10,533
Necesito un bueno worker.

3
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:12,337
Tu es fuerte. Come on.

4
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:22,277
We don't go with that man.

5
00:00:22,353 --> 00:00:24,947
I've seen several men go with
that man and none come back.

6
00:00:26,423 --> 00:00:27,481
We've lost friends...

7
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,520
We don't know what
he does with them.

8
00:00:32,563 --> 00:00:34,053
I don't wanna talk
about it anymore.

9
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:36,494
I pick up day laborers

10
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:38,467
and tell them that
they'll get paid at 6:00 p.m.

11
00:00:38,903 --> 00:00:41,633
At 5:45, a certain
I.N.S. Agent,

12
00:00:41,705 --> 00:00:43,502
by the name of Mose Schrute,

13
00:00:43,574 --> 00:00:45,132
throws them in
the back of a van,

14
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:46,733
drops them off in
the middle of Harrisburg

15
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,903
and tells them it's Canada.

16
00:00:51,248 --> 00:00:52,806
Tu es un bueno worker?

17
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:54,544
Si. Yo muy bueno worker.

18
00:00:54,685 --> 00:00:57,153
Yel acento...
Donde are you from?

19
00:00:57,254 --> 00:00:58,551
Scranton.

20
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:01,453
Y... before that,
la Philadelphia.

21
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:02,990
You speak English?
Yes.

22
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,652
I'm really good at English.
Okay, good, me too.

23
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:06,286
Get in the car.
Okay.

24
00:01:08,465 --> 00:01:10,296
Who is this guy
by our cars?

25
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:12,631
That is my new
maintenance worker, Nate,

26
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:14,466
and you'll be happy to know
that he's taking care of

27
00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:16,733
that hornet's nest that
you've been griping about.

28
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:18,674
Yeah. I got stung
up my dress.

29
00:01:18,742 --> 00:01:19,936
Poor hornet.

30
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,841
I've left him all
the tools he needs.

31
00:01:21,912 --> 00:01:23,277
This is do or die.

32
00:01:23,347 --> 00:01:25,076
If he chooses correctly,
he'll conquer the hornets.

33
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:26,810
And if he doesn't?

34
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:29,074
He'll die.

35
00:01:29,286 --> 00:01:30,719
What?
Beg your pardon?

36
00:01:30,788 --> 00:01:32,847
When did the phrase "do or
die" become so corrupted?

37
00:01:33,023 --> 00:01:34,820
Is that a blowtorch? No.

38
00:01:34,892 --> 00:01:37,725
No, no, no! No, no!

39
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:39,422
Interesting choice.

40
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:40,758
Yes.

41
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:41,954
Very, very smart.

42
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:43,021
Walking away.

43
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:44,656
No! No, no, no!

44
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:45,724
The bat.

45
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:46,960
What is he doing?

46
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:48,698
Oh!
They're stinging him!

47
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:49,966
No, no, no!

48
00:01:50,074 --> 00:01:51,268
No, no!

49
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:17,829
Good morning, Erin. Any
mustaches, I mean messages?

50
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:20,027
Terrific.

51
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:22,064
There are many reasons

52
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:24,198
a man would wear
a fake mustache to work.

53
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:26,375
He is a fan

54
00:02:26,443 --> 00:02:27,910
of the outrageous.

55
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:29,070
He loves to

56
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:30,408
surprise!

57
00:02:31,148 --> 00:02:34,276
He loves other things
as well.

58
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:36,375
Wow.

59
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:41,813
Okay.

60
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,360
It's a pimple,
Phyllis.

61
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:46,828
Avril Lavigne gets
them all the time,

62
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:48,524
and she rocks
harder than anyone alive.

63
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:50,661
That's no pimple, Michael.

64
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:52,228
You mean cancer?

65
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:54,701
What? No way. No. Definitely not.
Not cancer.

66
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:56,965
It's just good to catch a
Michael train of thought early

67
00:02:57,074 --> 00:02:59,372
before it derails and
destroys the entire town.

68
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,299
Wait, wait, wait.

69
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:02,504
It's just a cold sore.

70
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:03,603
It is?

71
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:05,478
Yup, just a cold sore.
Just a cold sore.

72
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:07,710
Thank you. Phyllis,
I don't have acne.

73
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:09,753
I have a cold sore.
I didn't even have a cold.

74
00:03:10,087 --> 00:03:11,111
I don't know how I got it.

75
00:03:11,188 --> 00:03:12,382
I know how you got it.

76
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:13,514
How?

77
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,784
Michael, come on.

78
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:16,890
A cold sore is herpes.

79
00:03:17,428 --> 00:03:19,293
What? What you
should do, Michael,

80
00:03:19,363 --> 00:03:20,625
is have a doctor
take a look at it,

81
00:03:20,698 --> 00:03:21,995
'cause we don't
really know what that is.

82
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,895
I know tons and tons
of people who have herpes.

83
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:26,366
I have it myself.

84
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:27,426
That's what it is.

85
00:03:27,504 --> 00:03:28,937
I've never seen
herpes on you.

86
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:30,633
'Cause it's on
my genitals, genius.

87
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:32,168
You have a penis?

88
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:34,707
Michael, have you ever
been tested for STDs?

89
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:36,870
Yeah, my last physical
when I was 40.

90
00:03:37,448 --> 00:03:38,540
That was, like,
10 years ago.

91
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:39,843
No, it was, like,
four years ago.

92
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,577
Michael,
you're at least 46.

93
00:03:41,652 --> 00:03:42,641
Why "at least"?

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,120
If you're guessing 46,
just say 46.

95
00:03:52,996 --> 00:03:55,362
Can we please talk about
how gross Meredith is?

96
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,226
This is what you get

97
00:03:57,301 --> 00:03:59,269
when you treat your
body like an outhouse.

98
00:04:00,437 --> 00:04:01,461
You know what, guys?

99
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:03,836
How about we just chill out a
little bit on the herp chat?

100
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:05,970
Okay? I was
an R.A. In college,

101
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:07,135
and I can tell you,

102
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:08,906
the number one sexually
transmitted disease

103
00:04:10,714 --> 00:04:12,181
is ignorance.

104
00:04:12,382 --> 00:04:15,180
I guess maybe she could marry
a meth dealer with crabs...

105
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:16,879
I don't even want
to know about these things.

106
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:18,114
Hey, guys.

107
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:27,057
How did this happen?
How did I get this?

108
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:29,326
Sometimes it can lie dormant
in a woman for years.

109
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,730
They may not even
know that they have it.

110
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:32,200
You know what?
I feel like

111
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:33,497
one of those
old-timey sailors with VD.

112
00:04:34,638 --> 00:04:36,538
Eh, it's me own darn fault.

113
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:38,336
Girl in every port!
What port?

114
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:40,376
The Jan port?

115
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:42,672
The Holly port?
Don't even...

116
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,538
Holly was clean, okay?

117
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:46,480
If anything,
I gave it to her.

118
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,040
You may have.
Oh, my God.

119
00:04:48,118 --> 00:04:49,142
What if I did?

120
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:51,244
You need to contact Holly.

121
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:54,313
You need to notify her that
she is crawling with herpes.

122
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,925
Okay. You know what?

123
00:04:55,993 --> 00:04:57,017
Might.

124
00:04:57,094 --> 00:04:59,654
Might be crawling with herpes.

125
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:02,589
I might have
gotten it after her.

126
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,725
You need to contact
every woman you've been with

127
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:06,827
and notify them of
your herpes infestation.

128
00:05:07,204 --> 00:05:08,364
It's the right thing to do.

129
00:05:08,772 --> 00:05:10,262
There's no way
I'm gonna do that.

130
00:05:10,507 --> 00:05:11,531
Then I will.

131
00:05:11,608 --> 00:05:12,700
All right, I...

132
00:05:14,578 --> 00:05:16,375
Now, I'm no doctor,
but it seems to me

133
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:18,471
that we all have an obligation
to the public health

134
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:20,915
to track down anyone
who gives us a disease,

135
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:22,281
inform them of it,

136
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:24,547
and take overwhelming revenge
on that person.

137
00:05:25,022 --> 00:05:26,819
Again, I'm no doctor.

138
00:05:26,924 --> 00:05:29,017
I'm just a normal guy
who enjoys revenge.

139
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:32,688
Hello.

140
00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:34,728
Hi, Donna. It's Michael.

141
00:05:35,065 --> 00:05:36,965
Michael. I didn't
think I'd hear from you.

142
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:38,291
How've you been?

143
00:05:38,368 --> 00:05:39,801
I have a disease

144
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,097
for which there
is no known cure

145
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:44,697
that has been
sexually transmitted to me.

146
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:46,436
Oh, no!

147
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:48,208
I can't even say it.

148
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:50,405
H-I

149
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,469
Oh, my God!

150
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:56,850
R-P-E-E-S.

151
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,754
Wait. You're calling to tell
me that you have herpes?

152
00:06:00,824 --> 00:06:04,851
No. I am calling to see
if you gave me herpes,

153
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:06,623
because if you did,

154
00:06:06,697 --> 00:06:08,892
I would be able to avoid
a lot of sucky conversations.

155
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,898
So you have it, right?
No.

156
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:13,566
Does your stupid
husband have it?

157
00:06:13,637 --> 00:06:15,002
No, he doesn't.

158
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:16,733
Are you telling me
I have to get tested?

159
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:18,975
Yes, I'm telling you you have
to get tested for herpes.

160
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:20,509
Good-bye!
So long, Donna.

161
00:06:20,878 --> 00:06:23,608
Excuse me, everyone, can I
have your attention, please?

162
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,704
Not again.

163
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:25,770
What do you mean "again"?

164
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:27,749
You're always
asking for our attention.

165
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:29,215
Well, maybe like a year ago.

166
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:30,480
Mmm. Seems recent.

167
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:31,851
No, that's...

168
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:34,015
Andy, the reason
it seems more recent

169
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:36,059
is because many of us here
have never stood up

170
00:06:36,126 --> 00:06:37,593
and asked for
everyone's attention,

171
00:06:37,794 --> 00:06:39,887
and it seems like you've done
it on several occasions.

172
00:06:39,963 --> 00:06:41,760
Everyone, I've noticed that

173
00:06:41,832 --> 00:06:44,630
we've not been entirely
kind to one of our own,

174
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:47,160
due to stigmas
and prejudices.

175
00:06:47,237 --> 00:06:48,829
Oh! When you got
your new phone,

176
00:06:48,906 --> 00:06:50,396
that's when you asked
for everyone's attention.

177
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:51,532
World Cup.
That's what I was thinking.

178
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:52,597
That's right.

179
00:06:52,676 --> 00:06:54,507
You kept announcing scores.

180
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:56,804
It's the world's only
international sport, so...

181
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:00,615
This is Holly.

182
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:03,746
No, this is Holly.

183
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:07,088
No, this is Holly.

184
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:09,319
No, this is Holly.

185
00:07:09,526 --> 00:07:11,460
No... This is Michael Scott.

186
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:14,390
Busted.

187
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:17,764
So, what can I
do for you, Holly?

188
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:19,699
I'm calling because

189
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:21,199
there was
a terrible car accident.

190
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:23,739
Oh, really?
Was anyone killed?

191
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:25,933
A lot of people.

192
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:27,306
Any nuns?

193
00:07:27,377 --> 00:07:28,605
Three nuns.

194
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:31,444
Missionaries
from South Africa.

195
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:34,079
Were they in
the missionary position?

196
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:37,883
Hot pizza, check it and see

197
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:41,422
I got a whole
Bunch of pepperoni

198
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:43,618
Yeah.
Now you're looking at me.

199
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:45,553
Anyone who's interested
in entering into

200
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:48,291
an honest discussion about
the sexual mores and taboos

201
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:51,892
of modern society will be
rewarded with a pizza break.

202
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:54,333
Do you ever wonder what
life would have been like

203
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:55,496
if you hadn't
been transferred?

204
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:57,801
Yeah.

205
00:07:57,874 --> 00:07:59,034
We would have twins.

206
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:00,999
I don't think
we'd have kids.

207
00:08:01,078 --> 00:08:02,477
Mmm-hmm.
We dated for a few weeks.

208
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:04,681
Mmm-mmm.
We would be married.

209
00:08:04,948 --> 00:08:07,815
Michael, I've been dating A.J.
For a year and a half now.

210
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:09,618
You do this, you know?

211
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:10,710
Do what?

212
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:13,021
You romanticize things.

213
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,788
I don't romantici...

214
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:16,848
No.

215
00:08:16,927 --> 00:08:17,951
Michael, you cried

216
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:20,087
at that tag line for
a movie you made up.

217
00:08:20,731 --> 00:08:21,993
"He had no arms or legs.

218
00:08:22,065 --> 00:08:23,657
"He couldn't see,
hear or speak.

219
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:26,735
"This is how he led a nation."

220
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:28,934
You made us out to be
more than we were.

221
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:31,200
Maybe we were
more than we were.

222
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:33,632
I don't know what you're
getting so upset about.

223
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,735
We had a fun fling
a long time ago.

224
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:37,876
It's a good memory.
Okay, all right.

225
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:39,848
I gotta go.
Michael...

226
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:45,520
He forgot
to mention the herpes.

227
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:47,820
It didn't come up
organically.

228
00:08:49,092 --> 00:08:51,322
...to accommodate
the suppliers.

229
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:53,792
Gentlemen, nice to see you.
It'll be just a moment.

230
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,659
If you could show them
into conference room B.

231
00:08:55,732 --> 00:08:56,721
The pharmaceutical company

232
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,324
should be able
to accommodate us.

233
00:08:58,435 --> 00:09:00,630
How do I do it?
Raise my daughter,

234
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:02,569
work as director of office
purchasing for this hospital

235
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,539
and release an album
of Doris Day covers

236
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:06,200
on my own label?

237
00:09:07,544 --> 00:09:08,909
If I knew,
I'd tell you.

238
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:10,037
It's nice to see you
doing so well.

239
00:09:10,313 --> 00:09:11,337
Yeah, I'm really happy.

240
00:09:11,448 --> 00:09:14,383
Me and Astrid against the world.
We're loving it.

241
00:09:14,618 --> 00:09:16,586
Yeah, so,
kind of the supermom.

242
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:18,143
Bringing home the bacon.
Yeah.

243
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:19,688
Fry it up in a pan

244
00:09:19,756 --> 00:09:21,121
Never, never, never let you

245
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:22,215
Forget you're a man

246
00:09:23,393 --> 00:09:24,883
Love that commercial.

247
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:26,861
I don't understand
the reference.

248
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:29,058
Well,

249
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:30,756
Michael, it was nice
to get your call.

250
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,893
We had to come over right away.
It's urgent. Okay.

251
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:34,300
Michael has something to tell you.
Shh.

252
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:35,838
Are you gonna
keep me in suspense?

253
00:09:43,914 --> 00:09:44,938
Would you excuse us?

254
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:46,004
Okay, I'm gonna

255
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:47,972
head outta here.

256
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:50,417
I know you have a lot
to talk about, okay?

257
00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:53,014
Is there an operating theater

258
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,387
that's open to visitors?

259
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,823
Never mind. I'll find it.

260
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:59,424
He hasn't changed.
No.

261
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:02,065
So, what couldn't wait?

262
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:05,228
Am I the kind of person

263
00:10:05,302 --> 00:10:07,236
to misremember
our relationship

264
00:10:07,304 --> 00:10:09,101
as something more
than it was?

265
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:10,161
Michael Scott,

266
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,470
you are here
for a post-mortem.

267
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:13,798
What?

268
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:16,111
You wanna dig into
our relationship,

269
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,978
go over it,
see what killed it.

270
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,542
Okay.

271
00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:24,013
I'm in.

272
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:26,279
So, guys,
I've been really bothered

273
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:29,382
by the way certain people are
getting treated around here.

274
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,428
And I just think as an office,
we're better than that.

275
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:35,096
Okay, now, I'm gonna
show you a picture

276
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:36,990
of genitalia.

277
00:10:38,168 --> 00:10:39,157
Andy.

278
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,767
What, 'cause he's black?
Nope.

279
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:43,100
It's 'cause it's genitalia.

280
00:10:43,173 --> 00:10:45,835
Perfectly normal genitalia,
Tuna.

281
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:49,573
Now I'm gonna show you
another picture

282
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:51,841
of perfectly normal
genitalia.

283
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:53,280
Oh, my God!

284
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:55,810
Am I blocking anybody?
Can everybody see?

285
00:10:55,886 --> 00:10:57,513
Perfectly normal.
Big deal.

286
00:10:57,721 --> 00:10:59,689
Yeah, sure,
it's got some herpes on it.

287
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:03,557
But you know what? It's just
as normal as anyone else's.

288
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:07,357
No. In the beginning,
we were not good.

289
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:09,496
Well, there was a bit
of a learning curve

290
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:11,362
in the conversation
department,

291
00:11:11,434 --> 00:11:13,095
but between the sheets,

292
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,637
we were like
Jordan and Pippen.

293
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:15,997
Well, if there was anything
exciting about it,

294
00:11:16,072 --> 00:11:17,937
it was because we both
knew it was wrong.

295
00:11:18,275 --> 00:11:19,333
Because we worked together.

296
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:20,433
No.

297
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,375
Okay, imagine
there's a princess

298
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:24,269
who falls for a guy
beneath her station,

299
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:25,814
and the queen
doesn't like this at all.

300
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,645
And the princess knows that
the queen doesn't like it,

301
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:29,150
and so it makes her
want to do it all the more

302
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:30,208
just to get at the queen.

303
00:11:31,454 --> 00:11:33,149
Am I the princess?
No, I'm the princess.

304
00:11:33,223 --> 00:11:34,713
And the queen.

305
00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:36,621
Okay. So I'm the guy
at the station.

306
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:39,551
Mommy!

307
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,558
Assie! Oh!

308
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:44,657
How was school?

309
00:11:44,734 --> 00:11:45,723
It was cool

310
00:11:45,802 --> 00:11:48,327
What did you learn?

311
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:49,702
What did I learn?

312
00:11:49,773 --> 00:11:52,264
You might have learned

313
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:54,902
Shapes, or blocks

314
00:11:54,978 --> 00:11:57,344
Or clocks, or colors

315
00:11:57,414 --> 00:11:59,245
Or you might have learned

316
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:02,444
That we're all
sisters and brothers...

317
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,816
I have herpes.

318
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:05,149
What? You...

319
00:12:06,022 --> 00:12:07,853
I used to think
that she was "the one."

320
00:12:08,658 --> 00:12:10,751
Or at least a "the one."

321
00:12:12,095 --> 00:12:13,790
And if I called
that one so wrong...

322
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,128
Herpes, like all STDs,
is a consequence of sex.

323
00:12:20,203 --> 00:12:22,137
Can anyone else name
any other consequences?

324
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,704
It feels unbelievable.

325
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:27,171
Okay, I guess we can
make a pros column.

326
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:29,367
"Feels..."

327
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:30,811
"Unbelievable."

328
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,938
Okay.

329
00:12:32,015 --> 00:12:34,506
The ability to
express love physically.

330
00:12:35,352 --> 00:12:37,149
It's a magical thing.

331
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:39,052
"Express love."
"Magical."

332
00:12:40,557 --> 00:12:41,956
It feels amazing.

333
00:12:42,225 --> 00:12:44,819
Um... Okay, is that different
from "feels unbelievable"?

334
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:46,628
Yes.

335
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:48,095
Then I will write it down.

336
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:50,892
The feeling of pure risk.

337
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:53,128
Creed, I had that
in the cons column,

338
00:12:54,037 --> 00:12:55,334
but...
It's thrilling.

339
00:12:55,672 --> 00:12:58,732
Okay. Then...

340
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:00,871
We'll move that.

341
00:13:00,944 --> 00:13:02,605
"Thrill of risk."

342
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,579
Andy, aren't there also
negatives to sex?

343
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:06,505
Yes! Thank you.

344
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:07,940
Such as...

345
00:13:08,018 --> 00:13:09,007
Unplanned pregnancy.

346
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,780
Yes. Unplanned pregnancy.

347
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:11,945
Like Jim and Pam, what?

348
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:13,011
Hey.

349
00:13:13,123 --> 00:13:15,284
Just admit that your
baby was a mistake.

350
00:13:15,358 --> 00:13:17,826
Whoa! Hey, our baby
was not a mistake.

351
00:13:19,195 --> 00:13:20,856
She was a surprise.
Good.

352
00:13:21,031 --> 00:13:23,158
I'm sure they don't
regret having that child.

353
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:24,222
Let's move it to the pros.

354
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:25,290
Thank you.

355
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:28,997
Okay. "Unplanned pregnancy,"
going in the pros column.

356
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,003
Next up is Helene.

357
00:13:32,842 --> 00:13:34,833
You're gonna want to
make a left on Willow,

358
00:13:34,978 --> 00:13:36,809
which is a little ways away.

359
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,869
I'll remind you.

360
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:39,881
You know, I don't know
if I trust Jan's judgment.

361
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:41,883
She...
Jan knows paper.

362
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:43,816
No, not paper.
Relationships.

363
00:13:43,887 --> 00:13:45,878
To have the ability
to point out

364
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:48,617
if a man is making a bigger
deal out of something

365
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:50,421
than is really there.
Wait, what Holly said?

366
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:52,392
Yes! I don't...
Forget it, Michael.

367
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:53,787
Today is about herpes.

368
00:13:53,863 --> 00:13:54,852
I know.

369
00:13:54,998 --> 00:13:57,091
Okay? Who gave it
to you, who has it...

370
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:58,361
Right.
And who is going to pay.

371
00:13:58,435 --> 00:13:59,424
Okay.

372
00:13:59,502 --> 00:14:00,491
To answer your
question about Jan...

373
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,003
No, Jan is insane.

374
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:03,198
Why do you think I...

375
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:04,432
Left! Willow, now!

376
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:05,565
All right! God!

377
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,877
Hi, stranger.

378
00:14:09,612 --> 00:14:10,670
Long time.

379
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:11,736
Who are you?

380
00:14:12,115 --> 00:14:14,174
I'm Michael.
We dated for a while.

381
00:14:14,384 --> 00:14:15,612
I don't think so.

382
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:17,280
Michael?

383
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:20,722
Oh, hey!

384
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:24,554
Dwight, would you take
my grandmother for a walk

385
00:14:24,627 --> 00:14:25,958
while I talk to
the real Helene?

386
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:27,053
Come on, old lady,
let's go.

387
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,119
What is happening?

388
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:29,722
Come on.

389
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:33,096
Who can tell me the
safest form of safe sex?

390
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:34,931
Condoms.
Incorrect.

391
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:37,198
The only true form
of safe sex...

392
00:14:38,241 --> 00:14:39,936
Okay? Abstinence.

393
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:42,203
Oh! I didn't
realize we were doing

394
00:14:42,512 --> 00:14:43,877
trick questions.

395
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,877
What's the safest
way to go skiing?

396
00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:47,680
Don't ski.

397
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:48,945
Huh?

398
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:50,677
I just thought
I'd bring it up

399
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:52,722
in case someone here
was practicing abstinence.

400
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:54,648
That's all. Anybody?

401
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,884
Andy, that's way too
personal of a question.

402
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,689
Well, someone could answer
it if they wanted to.

403
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:03,657
Okay, in that case,

404
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:06,998
I will now show you how
to put this condom on using...

405
00:15:09,572 --> 00:15:11,233
...this pencil.
Oh, God!

406
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:12,799
What?

407
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:14,366
Why would you
choose a pencil, Andy?

408
00:15:14,677 --> 00:15:16,201
Well, I'm not gonna
use my penis, Oscar.

409
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,042
It's not exactly
hard right now, anyway.

410
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:20,241
Come on, give it
a rest, pencil.

411
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:21,943
I'm doing this
for you, Meredith!

412
00:15:22,118 --> 00:15:23,881
I didn't want it!
Well, didn't you?

413
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:25,386
Why didn't...

414
00:15:25,455 --> 00:15:28,322
Does no one appreciate
what I'm doing right now?

415
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,621
Whoa!

416
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:34,726
It'll go away in time.
Just don't touch it.

417
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:37,292
Did I make more
of what we had

418
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:38,459
than was really there?

419
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:39,894
What did you think we were?

420
00:15:40,136 --> 00:15:43,162
Just a quirky indie movie,

421
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:44,706
weird sort of thing,

422
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,109
breaking all the rules,
but had to end

423
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:50,669
because the summer
was over for you.

424
00:15:51,314 --> 00:15:53,578
I think that for you
to have come here

425
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,641
even expecting

426
00:15:56,352 --> 00:15:58,149
that we could have
a conversation like this

427
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:01,156
shows how
self-deluded you are.

428
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:05,789
Michael, your memory
has failed you greatly.

429
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,022
Jerk.

430
00:16:21,177 --> 00:16:22,269
Michael.

431
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,975
So, this is a chef's kitchen,

432
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:28,483
which makes it perfect
for real entertainers.

433
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:30,810
Real entertainer,
like Billy Joel.

434
00:16:31,254 --> 00:16:33,984
Michael.
Carole. How are you?

435
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:35,385
I'm great. How are you?

436
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,154
I'm great.
I saw your sign outside,

437
00:16:38,294 --> 00:16:40,023
and I decided
I'm gonna pull in,

438
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,926
and maybe I'm going to
buy a house from her.

439
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:43,598
You didn't call my office

440
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,497
and ask them where I was? No!

441
00:16:45,568 --> 00:16:46,762
That's so...

442
00:16:46,936 --> 00:16:48,904
'Cause the receptionist
told me that a man called,

443
00:16:48,972 --> 00:16:51,133
but he would only say
that he was my ex-lover.

444
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:52,265
Weird.
Yeah.

445
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:53,366
Sounds like a nice guy.

446
00:16:54,077 --> 00:16:57,103
I don't know, I mean, people were
being really mean to Meredith and...

447
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,345
But this wasn't really
about Meredith, was it?

448
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:01,407
You and Erin
were broken up.

449
00:17:01,584 --> 00:17:03,745
How is that
relevant to anything?

450
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,550
I asked you if it was
okay if I asked her out.

451
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,480
You said, and I quote,

452
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:11,585
"My good sir,
nothing would make me happier

453
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:14,562
"than to hand you the hand
of the hand once in my hand."

454
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:17,728
I specifically remembered it because
you said it in such a weird way.

455
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:19,258
Well, the only
reason I said that

456
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:21,200
is 'cause you
asked me so politely,

457
00:17:21,337 --> 00:17:23,635
and it was very difficult
for me to say no.

458
00:17:24,707 --> 00:17:25,901
I'll let this slide,

459
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,270
but I expect you to put this
whole Erin thing behind you.

460
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:32,280
Oh, wow!
Another living room.

461
00:17:32,515 --> 00:17:33,504
It's a family room.

462
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,913
You put the TV there.
You put your family here.

463
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:39,912
Michael,
why are you here?

464
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,955
Somebody told me

465
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:44,960
that I romanticize
relationships.

466
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:47,853
You know,
we all do that.

467
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:50,021
I have herpes.

468
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,692
What?

469
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:53,893
Did you have that
while we were together?

470
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,062
I just found out today.

471
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:57,436
It's right there.

472
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,808
Oh! Oh! What, that's what
you're talking about?

473
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:01,570
Mmm-hmm. I'm sorry.

474
00:18:01,744 --> 00:18:03,041
Did you have a doctor
check it out?

475
00:18:03,112 --> 00:18:05,012
I'm between specialists
right now.

476
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:07,974
Yes. Yes, Michael.

477
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:11,247
Actually, you do make
a bigger deal out of things

478
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:12,720
than you need to.

479
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:15,017
You proposed to me
on our fourth date.

480
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,849
Well, I believe in
love at first sight.

481
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,588
Well, so do I,

482
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:20,856
but we didn't love each
other at first, either.

483
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:23,358
I don't know what
you were thinking.

484
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:26,459
I know what I was
thinking at the time,

485
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:28,527
but right now,
it just seems ridiculous.

486
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:30,236
Excuse me.

487
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,372
Someone died in the upstairs
bathroom, didn't they?

488
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,634
No.

489
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,641
We should
schedule meetings,

490
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:41,650
'cause the days can
slip away with chitchat.

491
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:44,480
Are you crying?

492
00:18:45,021 --> 00:18:46,511
No, I'm just sweating.

493
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:48,318
I don't know
what's got you upset,

494
00:18:48,391 --> 00:18:51,053
but my advice
is stop crying.

495
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:52,651
I'm not crying.
I'm sweating.

496
00:18:52,996 --> 00:18:54,725
Look, you need
to pick yourself up.

497
00:18:55,064 --> 00:18:56,725
Man up, all right?

498
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,265
Son, you will win this
in the end.

499
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:01,903
It's all about heart

500
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:03,995
and character.

501
00:19:04,073 --> 00:19:06,371
Be your best self.

502
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:08,467
Okay.

503
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:09,670
Yeah.

504
00:19:09,846 --> 00:19:11,336
I have no idea
what his problem is.

505
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:13,108
It's just my standard advice.

506
00:19:13,182 --> 00:19:14,410
It's good advice, right?

507
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:16,079
This is Holly Flax.

508
00:19:16,152 --> 00:19:17,346
I can't come to
the phone right now,

509
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,648
but please leave a message

510
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:20,712
at the sound of
the tiny truck backing up.

511
00:19:22,492 --> 00:19:24,119
Hi, Holly, it's Michael.

512
00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:26,956
I just wanted to
call and let you know

513
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,793
that I was thinking
about what you said.

514
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:31,432
It's just, you know,

515
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:35,270
it's weird. Today, I

516
00:19:35,805 --> 00:19:38,467
ended up seeing a lot of
the women that I used to date,

517
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:41,705
and in my mind,
they were all great.

518
00:19:42,578 --> 00:19:44,546
And then when I
actually saw them,

519
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:47,374
it was mostly a freak show.

520
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,708
And you and me,

521
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:51,253
that must have been
a real train wreck.

522
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:54,479
You know what?

523
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:57,788
Holly, you're wrong.

524
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:00,822
You are wrong.

525
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:04,261
I remember
every second of us.

526
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,392
And talking to you today,

527
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:11,065
I don't feel for them anything
like what I feel for you.

528
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:13,002
It's...

529
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,573
I didn't joke
with any of them.

530
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:17,272
I joked with you.

531
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,480
You were the only one

532
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:22,017
who was actually happy
to hear from me.

533
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:24,818
And I don't know why
you downgraded what we had,

534
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:26,980
but I did not make us up.

535
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:29,716
Okay.

536
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,919
Oh, and you might,
you should talk to a doctor

537
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:35,088
because you might have herpes.

538
00:20:35,231 --> 00:20:36,220
Bye.

539
00:20:42,438 --> 00:20:44,235
What is this about?
Oscar,

540
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:46,907
We once sucked face in public

541
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,874
as part of
an office presentation

542
00:20:49,946 --> 00:20:53,404
to destroy the stigma
about gay kissing.

543
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,547
Do you recall?
Yes, and...

544
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:57,745
You may have given me a
sexually transmitted disease.

545
00:20:58,254 --> 00:20:59,243
What?

546
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:00,311
Herpes duplex.

547
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,250
It's probably just an ingrown mustache
hair, but we have to be exhaustive.

548
00:21:03,626 --> 00:21:06,356
I've already contacted all of
my ex-lovers except for you.

549
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,324
We were never lovers.

550
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:10,695
I'm gonna need a list of every
man you've ever had sex with.

551
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:13,493
I'm talking train stations,
men's rooms...

552
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:16,538
Flower shops,
fireworks celebrations...

553
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:17,865
Fence with a hole in it.

554
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,964
Moonlit gondola.

555
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,565
Carriage ride
through Central Park.

556
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:22,133
The woods behind
the liquor store.

557
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:23,610
The swamp behind
the old folks' home.

558
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,237
Electric car dealership.

559
00:21:25,314 --> 00:21:26,804
The Democratic Primary.

560
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:29,010
Oscar, think about... Think.
