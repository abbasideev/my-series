1
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,497
I got a delivery for you.

2
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,141
Leave it at reception.

3
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:11,105
I'm supposed to
deliver this one in person.

4
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,409
Clean up on aisle five.

5
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,651
After three years of writing,
one year of shooting,

6
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,847
four years of re-shooting,
and two years of editing,

7
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,448
I have finally
completed my movie,

8
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,755
Threat Level Midnight.

9
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,349
Erin, Erin...
Yes?

10
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,475
What are you doing?

11
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:24,676
Guys...

12
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,915
Did you guys know that our own
Michael Scott has made a movie,

13
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:30,287
and that he maybe
will let us watch it,

14
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,786
but only if
everybody's dying to see it?

15
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,055
That's... Well, don't
put words in my mouth.

16
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:39,761
Threat Level Midnight is the great
lost film of Michael Scott.

17
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,292
We're all in it from, like, years and
years ago. It's like a home movie.

18
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,671
Yeah, if Michael
Scott did your home movie.

19
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,642
Michael screened a work in
progress for us years ago,

20
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,077
and it didn't go well.

21
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,771
We thought it was a comedy.

22
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,147
Everything pointed
to it being a comedy.

23
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,207
Yep.

24
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,275
We'd love to see it.

25
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:02,016
Sweet. I will go invite Holly.

26
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,716
Okay, everyone, I know
we're really excited to

27
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,727
see this movie
that everybody's in,

28
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,956
but we have to remember
that Michael is sensitive.

29
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,726
So, let's stay positive.

30
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,235
And no laughing, no comments,
just positive energy,

31
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,999
and we'll have
a pure fun day, okay?

32
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,403
Thanks, Mom.

33
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,301
You never told me you made a movie.
Mmm-hmm.

34
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,607
It's got action. It's got heart.
It's got symbolism.

35
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,974
It's got you.
It's got a lot of me.

36
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,776
I can't wait.

37
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,812
Ladies and gentlemen,
Threat Level Midnight.

38
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:46,428
Michael Scarn? Well, that
is an interesting story.

39
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:53,098
He was once the best secret
agent in the business.

40
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,113
That was years ago.

41
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,744
Where is he now?

42
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,586
Well, that's also
an interesting story.

43
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,198
Master Scarn.

44
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,293
Master Scarn!

45
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,804
I play Samuel,
Michael Scarn's robot butler.

46
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,463
I wanted Samuel's voice

47
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,872
to be like this.

48
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,739
But Michael thought
that Samuel should be

49
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,176
a very advanced android,

50
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,339
almost indistinguishable
from a real person.

51
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,714
Dwight does not
play a robot.

52
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:39,975
I'm up.

53
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,043
It's the President.

54
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,384
He needs you for a mission.

55
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,924
Tell him I'm retired.

56
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,389
It's Goldenface.

57
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,156
Goldenface.

58
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,753
This makes it personal.

59
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,238
Scarn, you're right on time.

60
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,730
Hail to the chief.

61
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:01,898
I gave up a lot of weekends,

62
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,637
because I thought it would
be good for my daughter

63
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:08,512
to see a black man as President,
even in a silly home movie.

64
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,676
What a stupid waste of time.

65
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,016
It's your old enemy,
Goldenface.

66
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,112
He's after
the NHL all-star game.

67
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:18,156
He's hidden a bomb somewhere
in the stadium. Scarn,

68
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,358
this one is personal for me.

69
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,726
I own the stadium.

70
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,027
I can't see it blown up.

71
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,532
It's my retirement plan.

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,863
We have to search the stadium.

73
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,264
Not so fast.

74
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,100
Goldenface has
taken all of the

75
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,901
concession stand
workers hostage.

76
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:37,134
Scarn, will you find these
hostages and save the game?

77
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,611
Heads I do it,
tails I don't.

78
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,706
Best out of seven.

79
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:45,845
Heads.

80
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,222
Tails.

81
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,756
Heads.

82
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,486
Tails.

83
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,087
Heads.

84
00:04:58,865 --> 00:04:59,889
Tails.

85
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,275
Looks like there's gonna be
a clean up on aisle five.

86
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,186
Well,
the hostages were scared.

87
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,382
Don't you guys get it?
Nobody's coming for us.

88
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,516
Oh,
someone's coming, all right.

89
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:29,393
The only man who would care,
Michael Scarn.

90
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:34,193
See, I'm gonna lure him here,
then I'm gonna kill everybody,

91
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,294
then I'm gonna dig
up Scarn's dead wife,

92
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,771
and I'm gonna
hump her real good.

93
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:42,970
I did not
love the dialog,

94
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,844
or the character.

95
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:49,940
I took the role to impress a
receptionist, who will remain nameless.

96
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,451
Well, the all-star
game was three days away.

97
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,886
So, naturally,
it was all sold out.

98
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,857
The only way Scarn was
getting in was in a uniform.

99
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,756
Just one problem with that.

100
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,694
Scarn didn't know a hockey
stick from a Slim Jim.

101
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:06,699
So, he went to meet with the
famed trainer, Cherokee Jack.

102
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,995
Mop the ice.

103
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,568
I'm not here to
learn how to mop.

104
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,137
I'm here to learn
how to play hockey.

105
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,330
Mop it.

106
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,581
Come on. Come on!

107
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,372
Now, take this.

108
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,274
What am I
supposed to do with this?

109
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,434
Mop.

110
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,876
Well, Michael Scarn
was quickly becoming

111
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,479
one of the hottest
hockey players in the country.

112
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,287
Each year, the National Hockey
League accepts one civilian amateur

113
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,918
to play in the all-star game.

114
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,724
It's down to the three of you.

115
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:13,324
The final test
is speed skating.

116
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,999
On your marks, get set...

117
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,463
Die.

118
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:43,530
Nice try, Goldenface. Except you
forgot one thing, to kill me.

119
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,531
Oh, I wasn't
trying to kill you.

120
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,794
I was trying to
slow you down.

121
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,800
No!

122
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,134
Oh, by the way...

123
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:54,536
Yeah?

124
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,132
How's your wife doing?

125
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:00,980
Congratulations.

126
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,516
Hey, you came in second.
Not bad either, champ.

127
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,415
I am so sorry I
have to do this.

128
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,769
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

129
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,829
I'm intercepting
a name.

130
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,305
Jasmine Windsong.

131
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,799
She works for Goldenface.

132
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:33,574
But what I can't figure out
is, who is the Funky Cat?

133
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,376
Not "who," what.

134
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,747
The Funky Cat is the
hippest jazz club in town.

135
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,148
Oh! Oh...

136
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,924
He cut the part where my
circuit board malfunctioned?

137
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,659
Then what was the point of
spilling the drink on me?

138
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,006
They call me Jasmine Windsong

139
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,133
Bingo.

140
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:06,740
He finished his movie? No kidding.
Wow, that's great.

141
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,509
Yeah, good for him.

142
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,030
The hostages are
under the stadium

143
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,034
Check, please.

144
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:36,736
You have to let us go, Goldenface.
We have families.

145
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,510
Ha! This is gonna show them
that I mean business.

146
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,809
See ya.

147
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,492
Far and away the most
expensive shot of the movie,

148
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:59,192
but it was
integral to the story.

149
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,968
It's Scarn!

150
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,534
Sorry about
your friend, Scarn.

151
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,506
The joke's on you,
Goldenface.

152
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,770
That man was
a wanted animal rapist.

153
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,078
We've searched the whole
building, Goldenface.

154
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,011
Where is the bomb?
Hmm?

155
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,111
We've searched the whole
building, Goldenface.

156
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,844
Where is the bomb?
Hmm?

157
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,715
We've searched the...
Okay.

158
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,346
He said,
"Where is the bomb?"

159
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,718
In the puck.

160
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,452
But why are you
telling me this?

161
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,428
Because I'm going
to kill you, unless

162
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,260
you forgive me for
murdering your wife.

163
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,909
Hey, Goldenface.
Yeah?

164
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,377
Go puck yourself.

165
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,906
No!

166
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,645
That was not scripted.

167
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,117
More Tylenol.

168
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,558
You've already had four.

169
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,127
Oh, God!

170
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,157
So good.

171
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,458
You're lucky
to be alive.

172
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,829
It'll take a lot more
than a bullet to the brain,

173
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:11,929
lungs, heart, back and balls
to kill Michael Scarn.

174
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:16,170
Let's just make sure that
everything's working properly.

175
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:30,881
You just said,
"The bomb is in the puck"?

176
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,050
Yes.

177
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,219
Is that where you hid
the bomb, Goldenface?

178
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,465
But why would you
blow up the stadium?

179
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,296
You own the stadium.

180
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,496
For the insurance money.
I knew it all along.

181
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,538
You will never
get away with this.

182
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,119
Where had I gone wrong?

183
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:06,182
All I wanted was to start a
family with my beautiful wife,

184
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:10,162
but somewhere along the way,
things got messed up.

185
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,062
It wasn't easy
for Scarn to admit

186
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,030
that he'd lost
his self-confidence.

187
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,634
And he hadn't, of course.

188
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,529
He just wasn't
using it right now.

189
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:19,937
Mike!

190
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,269
Beer me, Billy.

191
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,567
You don't look so good.
What's got you down?

192
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:26,169
I got problems, Billy.
Big problems.

193
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,841
You got problems?
My TV don't work.

194
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:32,352
I pay $30 a month for the damn
satellite whats-a-whose-it.

195
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,478
I can't even
get the damn game.

196
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,715
Now, you tell me,
what's worse than that?

197
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:38,791
Don't ever change, Billy.

198
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,694
Goldenface is going to blow up
the NHL all-star game tomorrow.

199
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,725
I see what you
mean about problems.

200
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,098
I know what'll cheer you up.

201
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,967
That table of bachelorettes over
there bought you this drink.

202
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:56,873
Hey.

203
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,903
Ever banged an entire
bachelorette party, baby?

204
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:05,246
Why are you singling my line out,
like, a million years later?

205
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:08,117
I'm too depressed
to save the big game, Billy.

206
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:12,090
I'm gonna cheer you up the only
ways I know hows. Hey, kid,

207
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,056
hit G-9 on the jukebox.

208
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,896
No, Billy, I haven't done that
dance since my wife died.

209
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,401
There's a whole
crowd of people out there

210
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,004
who need to learn
how to do the Scarn.

211
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,713
Well, my name's Michael Scarn
And I'm here to say

212
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,841
I'm about to do the Scarn
In a major way

213
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,447
You jump to the right
And you shake a hand

214
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,686
Then you jump to the left
And you shake that hand

215
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,887
You meet new friends
You tie some yarn

216
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,021
And that's how
you do the Scarn

217
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:53,157
You jump to the right
And you shake a hand

218
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,463
Then you jump to the left
And you shake that hand

219
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,629
Meet new friends
Tie that yarn

220
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,673
That's how you do the Scarn

221
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,332
You jump to the right
And you shake a hand

222
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,433
Shh. Stop.

223
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,272
Meet new friends
Tie that yarn

224
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,508
That's how you do the Scarn

225
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,710
If doing the Scarn is gay,

226
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,515
then I'm
the biggest queer on earth!

227
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,321
You guys, I think I have...
Sorry.

228
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,621
I'm really sorry.

229
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,286
Hey, hey.
Michael!

230
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,821
Michael, I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

231
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,298
I think I was just
relieved to see that

232
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,867
Michael Scarn got
his confidence back.

233
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:30,062
Yeah, Michael,
the movie's amazing.

234
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:33,265
It's, like, one of the best
movies I've ever seen in my life.

235
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,864
You should enter
it in festivals.

236
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,136
Or carnivals.
Yeah.

237
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:41,445
Well, that's a pretty good reaction.
That's pretty cool, right?

238
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,181
Did you like it?
Did you like that?

239
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,151
Which part?

240
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,246
Okay.

241
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,154
All right.
Come on.

242
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,556
No.
Michael.

243
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,059
No, come on!

244
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,661
We have to see the end.

245
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,163
No, it's not good enough.
It's not good enough.

246
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,427
Some people are
really popping on-screen.

247
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,166
Hey.
Hey.

248
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,969
Good movie.
Mmm.

249
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,371
Good?

250
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,173
Everybody out
there says it's great.

251
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,237
I loved it.
Did you?

252
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,679
What did you love about it?

253
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:20,015
Um... I loved that you got to work
together with all your friends.

254
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,110
Mmm-hmm.

255
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,383
Isn't that so great when you can
all work together like that?

256
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:26,324
No, no. Holly,
this isn't Ocean's Eleven,

257
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,724
where you get together
with all your friends,

258
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,059
and you just have fun, and you
don't care about how it turns out.

259
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,597
What'd you really think,
honestly?

260
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:33,758
Um...

261
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,528
Is it...

262
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,866
Is it because you're afraid of
where this is gonna take me?

263
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,237
Because, see, I need you
to keep me grounded.

264
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,101
Not worried about that.

265
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:48,440
This is 11 years, okay?

266
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:51,211
This has been
my dream for 11 years,

267
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,980
and if you don't
think it's great,

268
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,248
then you're basically saying
you don't believe in my dream.

269
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,485
It's your dream? You never
even mentioned it before.

270
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,789
We talk about
a lot of things, Holly.

271
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,761
You know, I was
eventually going to

272
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,890
get around to my dream,
obviously.

273
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,297
Eleven years
that I could've been

274
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,891
working on "The
Scarn Nebulous."

275
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,369
Well, why do you have to
make a movie at all?

276
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,997
Because if I don't have this,
what do I have? I have nothing.

277
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,774
Really? You can't think of
anything else that you might have?

278
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:20,541
I have my book on business,
Somehow I Manage.

279
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,648
I have my HBO comedy special,
"Here I Go Again..."

280
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,652
But, you know what?
When I think about it,

281
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:30,053
when I really think about it,
none of those things

282
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,318
are as real to me
as my movie.

283
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,517
I'm real.

284
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,753
Yeah, you're
a real pain in the ass.

285
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,863
And now, I'm gonna
go watch the movie

286
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,398
with people who
think it's great.

287
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,163
And I'm sorry I called
you a pain in the ass.

288
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:45,262
I'm angry, and I love you.

289
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,568
I love you, too.

290
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:52,737
I am a huge Woody Allen fan.

291
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,576
Although I've only seen Antz.

292
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:57,742
But I'll tell you something,
what I respect about that man

293
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,012
is that when he
was going through

294
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,247
all of that stuff that
came out in the press,

295
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,381
about how Antz was just
a rip-off of A Bug's Life,

296
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:07,950
he stayed true to his films.

297
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,191
Or at least the film that I
saw, which, again, was Antz.

298
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,926
Thing is,

299
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,763
I thought A Bug's
Life was better,

300
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,394
much better than Antz.

301
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,668
Point is, don't listen
to your critics.

302
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,300
Listen to your fans.

303
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,003
Who likes Threat
Level Midnight?

304
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,682
Okay, well, then who wants
to watch the rest?

305
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,122
Michael, you have to get
to that puck before halftime

306
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,181
or the whole
stadium will explode.

307
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:42,524
I know. It's a good thing my trainer
and mentor is here to cheer me on.

308
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:43,756
Cherokee Jack?

309
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,628
Michael, he died.

310
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,538
This one's for you,
Cherokee Jack.

311
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,611
We filmed this
during an actual

312
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,280
Scranton High School
hockey game.

313
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,053
They were trying to
qualify for states...

314
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,156
It's fine. It's great.

315
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,459
No, no. Actually, it was
really screwed up because

316
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,898
they were trying to qualify.

317
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,095
They were disqualified.
They had to forfeit the game.

318
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,163
Undefeated season. That's why
there were so many people there.

319
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,145
Why is your face gold?

320
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,873
Why do you care?

321
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,381
I'm just making conversation.

322
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,078
I worked in a gold factory.

323
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,313
We had a boss who
only cared about money.

324
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,185
Hey.
Hey, I'm sorry.

325
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,621
It is good.

326
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,157
No, no, it's not.

327
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,217
It's not.

328
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:51,822
But they really seem
to be enjoying it. Come on.

329
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,559
Please,
Goldenface, let us go!

330
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,337
Cherokee Jack.

331
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,969
I want you to take
all your frustrations

332
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,514
with women,
the system, with everything,

333
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,707
take it out on the puck.

334
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,745
All on the puck.

335
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,113
Hey, we got
sports games again.

336
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,713
Oh...

337
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:02,234
Some breakfast for me,
some breakfast for you.

338
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,970
Yeah, I guess I did
let him be a robot.

339
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,835
I'll get it.

340
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,402
Man, I love being retired.

341
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,237
Scarn here.

342
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,283
Michael, it's the President.
Hello, sir.

343
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,908
I need you for
another mission.

344
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:22,945
Yeah, I'm in.

345
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,155
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
isn't the President evil?

346
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,994
Oh, yeah. Yes, he is.

347
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,862
No, no, he's doing it
to catch the President.

348
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,528
No, no, Dwight,
he's just being stupid.

349
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:41,974
Well, Michael Scarn
was back in the game.

350
