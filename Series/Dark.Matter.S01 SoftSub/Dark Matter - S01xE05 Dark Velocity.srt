[CHUCKLES] There was a vending machine at the hospital...

know where to get anywhere else.

176
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,180
And I logged into the system...

177
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,940

[BLAIR SIGHS]

179
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,320
It happened a year ago.

181
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,080

184
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,980
with whatever this other version of me brought back.

185
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,860
Holy shit.

187
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,870

188
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,200

189
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,960
So you've been up there.

This is Velocity. There must be extra ampoules.
