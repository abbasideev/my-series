204
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,480
A long time ago, I tried to build a 1" cube...

205
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,710
that could put an aluminum nitride disc in superposition.

206

No, I-I never finished.

211
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,840
Could never find a way to fully shield
the box from the outside environment...

212
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,150
and the superposition state kept collapsing.

213
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,990
Okay. So your memories stopped before winning the Pavia.

Jason, you came up with so much more.

217
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,410
See, underneath that alloy...

218
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,990
is a layer of active, adaptive shielding
that you developed.
