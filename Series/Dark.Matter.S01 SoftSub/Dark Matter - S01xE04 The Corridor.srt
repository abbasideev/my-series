00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,920
[CHUCKLES] Are you serious?

724
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,500
It's parked outside.

726
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,520
[CHUCKLES] Holy shit!

727
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,450
Jason, what the fuck?

728
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,370
Listen, I quit my job today.

729
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:01,740
What?
- [STUTTERS]

730
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:04,950
I was standing up there, looking out at the class...

731
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:07,960
and this one thought kept repeating
in my head, it was just...

732
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:11,420
that I was meant for more than this.

733
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:13,170
Without talking to me?

734
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,760
Yeah. I know. I'm sorry.

735
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:17,750
But I just couldn't do it anymore.
- Okay.

736
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:22,050
But my job isn't enough to float us, let alone buy a car.

737
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:25,560
I think you should quit your job
and get back to painting.

738
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,980
Oh, yeah? How am I gonna do that?

739
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,680
Before Charlie was born, I was working on a thing.

740
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,230
Remember the little box.

741
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:34,310
Yeah?

742
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:35,650
It was very important to me...

743
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:39,740
but I quit because I wanted to be
fully present for you both.

744
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:42,160
I got an investor.

748
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,030
Can we, uh, go for a ride?

749
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,200
Yeah. Come on.
- Yeah?

750
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,590
DANIELA: Sure.

751
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:56,470
You don't have to worry about money anymore.

752
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,380
You wanna ride shotgun?

753
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,010
CHARLIE: Mom, you coming?

754
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,810
Coming.
