http://hiqve.com/

2
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,360
What does it look like to you?

3
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:30,780
Dog piss?

4
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,449
Lamp oil.

5
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,119
Sewage.

6
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,914
Trouble is, our patient here, Mr. Ludd,

7
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:44,001
has probably, at one time or another,
drank all those substances.

8
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:49,298
It needs to thoroughly disgust them.

9
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,633
Wendell,

10
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,720
when you next look at this liquid,

11
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:58,349
you will realize that it's not whiskey
you've been drinking your whole life,

12
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,144
but your mother's feces.

13
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,481
Sometimes, this comes a
bit too easily to you.

14
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,902
From now on, every bit of alcohol,

15
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:13,114
whiskey, beer, wine,

16
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:16,159
is made of your mother's waste.

17
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,914
If you drink it, it will
make you horribly sick.

18
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,335
You will be nauseated even at the sight.

19
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:32,383
I will now wake you on the count of three.

20
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,262
One,

21
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,098
two,

22
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,477
three.

23
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,490
I'm gonna start writing this up.

24
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,248
D. W. Garrison Carr.

25
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,794
That's two "Rs" in Garrison,
two "Rs" in Carr.

26
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,421
I'm under the care of Dr. Algernon Edwards.

27
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,548
That's one "R".

28
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,383
I don't see it here.

29
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,052
Mr. Carr.

30
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,386
Opal.

31
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:20,306
What are you doing here?

32
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,310
I'm trying to check in,
but it appears they don't have my name.

33
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,315
There must be some confusion.

34
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:35,738
Were you told that I had gotten approval
to perform your surgery here?

35
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,616
I'm giving you the go-ahead.

36
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,245
This...

37
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,499
This is not the way I wanted this handled.

38
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,750
I know.

39
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,672
You wanted permission. Now you have it.

40
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,382
From us.

41
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,485
Are you still awake?

42
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,031
Yes.

43
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,337
What's so funny?

44
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,633
Why are you... Why are you wearing that?

45
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,056
Well, I thought to come in fully clothed
would be wrong,

46
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:49,145
and then to come in fully unclothed
would be too forward, so...

47
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,984
How would that be too forward?

48
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,823
I think that's the point.

49
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,160
I'm hoping you'll be forward.

50
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,388
- May I?
- Come on.

51
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,897
Oh, God.

52
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:44,075
- Are you nervous?
- Yes. Yeah, a bit.

53
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,328
Why, do I seem nervous?

54
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:52,583
- No. Me, too.
- Good. Good.

55
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,504
Do you know what you're doing?

56
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,715
I don't know, really.

57
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:05,137
A little bit. Do...
Do you know what you're doing?

58
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,555
Not a bit.

59
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,517
Though...

60
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,312
My uncle was a furrier

61
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,856
who owned a farm
and he bred minks and beavers,

62
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,859
so, I have something to go on.

63
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,449
Like that?

64
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:31,998
What?

65
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,917
You really know how to set the mood.

66
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,763
Just kiss me.

67
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,599
I'm trying.

68
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,619
Give it to me now.

69
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,299
It took three fittings,

70
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,885
but it's perfect.

71
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,972
Perfect? It's exquisite.

72
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:34,935
This is French Chantilly
with silk floss taffeta.

73
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,565
Do you know how much your Henry
must have spent on this?

74
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,650
I know exactly how much.

75
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,445
He didn't buy it.

76
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,696
I did.

77
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,240
He didn't buy it?

78
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,284
No.

79
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,245
But he expects it.

80
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,123
And he's gonna get it.

81
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,505
This is only half of what you owe me.

82
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:07,009
Yeah, I've had some unforeseen expenses.
We're all feeling the pinch.

83
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,014
Perhaps there'd be more money
if you weren't skimming so much of it

84
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,016
to pay for your new apartment.

85
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,062
My firm works with real estate men
all over the city.

86
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,106
I have friends. We talk.

87
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,526
In fact, I was thinking of
visiting that building myself

88
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,697
to see that dirty little whore and her
chinky-eyed escort you've been bringing by.

89
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,617
That has nothing to do with this building.

90
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,830
Well, if that's true, it shouldn't be
a problem for you to tell your board

91
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:40,042
I need the rest of my money,
and my rate is going up by $1 an hour.

92
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,350
Excuse me, doctor?

93
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:12,241
My hernia doesn't seem
to like this bed too much.

94
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:17,079
Would it be possible to get something
for my discomfort?

95
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,206
No.

96
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,507
- What?
- Have you seen what's in the ward?

97
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,635
I told you I would talk to the board.

98
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,261
And I appreciate that.

99
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,723
Bringing Carr wasn't my idea.
It was his. I didn't know.

100
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,725
And you couldn't ask him to leave?

101
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,436
I could have, but I didn't because...

102
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:28,609
Because deep down,
I knew the board would never allow it.

103
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,738
I knew that asking
would just be a waste of time.

104
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,407
And enough time has been wasted already.

105
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,451
Well, congratulations on your victory.

106
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,537
He's the first, and likely the last,
for a very long time.

107
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,456
I have no doubt
that the board will make sure of it.

108
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,416
They're happy to treat worthless drug addicts

109
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,960
who've tossed away their own lives,

110
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,380
but God forbid they commit the sin
of treating deserving colored folks...

111
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,715
You have your cause and I have mine.

112
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,384
If you could have been a little more patient,

113
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,427
I might have been able
to make this happen legitimately.

114
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,930
Instead, you act like an impetuous child.

115
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,475
You want this man to stay,
this is now a fight you fight alone.

116
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,435
I didn't expect it to be any other way.

117
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,772
- Is this a provocation?
- No, it's the future.

118
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,400
You think it's here too early
and I think it's here too late.

119
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,111
I don't know. I don't know.

120
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,863
Did we make a mistake
going with the hydrangea?

121
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,325
Because the color seems to clash
with the tablecloth.

122
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,702
Oh.

123
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,330
And the salad forks
aren't polished correctly. Look.

124
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,915
It looks fine.

125
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:30,754
Fine is not what these guests expect.
You of all people know that.

126
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,883
Would you please hand me my purse?
I have some nerve tonic inside.

127
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,510
Oh.

128
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,305
I don't understand how you're so calm.

129
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:44,018
Because I know that this is going to be
the best charity ball of the season.

130
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,064
I need to leave.
I have a final fitting for my dress.

131
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,692
- Now?
- I'll come back straight after.

132
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,515
Can I help you, miss?
You're just off that ship?

133
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,727
No, I came in here to speak to someone.

134
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,646
- Are you expected?
- No.

135
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,193
- The Corinthian is due tomorrow.
- Expected, anyways.

136
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,236
It's one of my father's ships.

137
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,030
The Robertson line.

138
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,784
I'm Cornelia Robertson. Well, Showalter now.

139
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,036
You here on some sort of business?

140
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,621
I suppose.

141
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,292
Then you're gonna want to be speaking
with Lead Inspector Bradley.

142
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,714
I remember when he was just starting out.

143
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,468
Your old dad was hustling
a few thirdhand buckets of bolts.

144
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,680
Helming most of them himself.
Look at him now.

145
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,059
Every time I see a ship
marked "Robertson Shipping",

146
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,811
I tell my men to treat it right.

147
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:12,272
Oh, I know he'd be grateful.
The company means everything to us.

148
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,735
Never known a woman
to work a company business.

149
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,904
Especially one like you.

150
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,490
My father has a lot of trust in me.

151
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:26,745
Are you here on a separate matter,
or our usual deal?

152
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:33,085
No, just the usual deal.
No one else was available.

153
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,504
Normally, we take care of this
at the end of the month,

154
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,340
but I can give you what I've got so far.

155
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,817
They're coming in
from everywhere these days.

156
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,652
Every month there's more.

157
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:03,073
But you won't hear anyone bellyaching
around here, even if it is more work.

158
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,117
Are these all the passengers?

159
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,661
Just the ones
that would have been sent back.

160
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,164
Oh, and one of my inspectors.

161
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,585
He says he got sick
from one of the ones that we let through.

162
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:18,839
Threatened to go to the higher-ups
if we didn't give him a bigger cut.

163
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,716
We took care of that.

164
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,302
Oh.

165
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:26,638
- What kind of sick?
- Didn't say.

166
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,807
- You didn't ask?
- No.

167
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,645
Any idea which of the passengers
got the inspector sick?

168
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,233
One of the steerage scum or third-classers
that we bumped to second-class.

169
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:42,446
We keep them out of sight
and get them off quick here at the docks.

170
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,949
Of course.
Well, anything's better than having them

171
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,077
pass through health
inspection at Ellis Island.

172
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,497
Yeah, it's smart,

173
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:56,293
paying me to send them through
instead of paying to send them back.

174
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,753
Big savings.

175
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,923
You Robertsons are clever.

176
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,091
We certainly are.

177
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,805
We've been working with spacers to create
excess skin to cover the separation point.

178
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:15,437
We need to be meticulous and go slowly,
so, stemming blood loss is crucial.

179
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:19,066
The more experienced nurses
will be assisting one surgeon each.

180
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,776
Nurse Pell, Dr. Edwards.

181
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,194
Baker, Gallinger.

182
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,820
Nurse Elkins, you'll be with me.

183
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,198
Nurse Shane, as you have
the most experience with ether,

184
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:30,035
you'll be assisting Dr. Chickering
on keeping both girls anesthetized.

185
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,621
Nurse Ryan and Nurse Kenilworth

186
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,707
will be keeping a close count on
how much blood each girl has surrendered.

187
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:39,795
Since we're sure that Zoya and Nika each
have their own circulatory system,

188
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,714
we may be able to safely
transfuse from one to the other,

189
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,883
depending on their individual condition.

190
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,885
But I see this only as a last resort.

191
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,346
It would be historic.

192
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,724
I'm not looking to make history
with their transfusion.

193
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,727
I want to make history with their survival.

194
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,647
Would you want a reporter there
to chronicle that history?

195
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,733
- Genevieve asked.
- She's welcome to attend.

196
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,694
As the girls are white.

197
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:09,575
But I was hoping to capture this surgery
with something more than just words.

198
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,993
- Photographs.
- No.

199
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,830
I was thinking of one of those
new motion picture cameras.

200
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,040
Has a surgery ever been
captured that way before?

201
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,584
There's always a first.

202
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:22,170
- I believe Henry Robertson has one.
- Well, let's ask him for it.

203
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,800
Put the thing to some real use,
instead of capturing silly street scenes,

204
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,219
or whatever else he uses it for.

205
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,229
Hey there.

206
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,775
Where are you off to all gussied up?

207
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,072
Church. They can throw me out if they want,
but they're gonna have to do it to my face.

208
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,783
I'll go with you.

209
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:55,746
I can fight my own battles.
I don't need you causing rows, picking fights.

210
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,956
Yeah, I'm going with you
'cause I want to punch out a nun.

211
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,293
Figured a good left hook
would get right through that habit.

212
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:05,005
I just thought it'd be nice, you know?
The show ain't bad.

213
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,841
Some of them homilies is all right.

214
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:12,137
And I know most of them songs,
so I figured, why the hell not?

215
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,806
Because you scorn God
at every chance you get.

216
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:19,895
Ah, in fairness, he scorned me first.
Now, do you want me to go, or don't you?

217
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:24,358
Okay, then.
But wear something clean, and no cussing.

218
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,818
The only thing cleaner than my mouth
will be my fucking shirt.

219
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:30,489
Now go back in your cave
unless you want an eyeful.

220
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,787
Can't be here until sunup.

221
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,665
I'll only be a minute.

222
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,333
Relative?

223
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,335
Patient.

224
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,047
They put that fancy headstone in
a few weeks ago.

225
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:32,592
Don't usually see one that big for a kid.

226
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,053
Maybe it's for the woman she never got to be.

227
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,139
Then she would have been some woman.

228
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,349
That cost 50 bucks at least.

229
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,354
Sixty-five.

230
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:02,247
Good morning, girls.
It's time for us to get you ready.

231
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,677
Good morning, doctor.

232
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:19,931
Bertie, do me a favor.
Hop up there, would you?

233
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,141
Sure.

234
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,358
- Sturdy.
- Good.

235
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,488
Last thing we need are these tables
splitting like the Red Sea

236
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,865
in the middle of the operation.

237
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,451
Have you been drinking?

238
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:44,289
No, no, no. It's turpentine.
A little gut irritation.

239
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,958
You want to be careful
with how much you take of that.

240
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,627
You don't want to start
trading your gut problem

241
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,879
for a bladder problem
caused by the medicine.

242
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,631
Thank you, Doctor.

243
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,218
Well, the girls can begin being prepped.

244
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,720
They already are.

245
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:03,141
I hope you got some rest 'cause
this is gonna be a real test of stamina.

246
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:07,646
Some. Did you? I'm guessing not.

247
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,316
Are you concerned about the procedure?

248
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,944
It can wait a few days.
We can always postpone.

249
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:18,949
No, no, no. I feel excellent, really.
I'll see you in the scrub room in 20 minutes.

250
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,493
Hello.

251
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,287
It's me.

252
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,498
Are you all right?

253
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,624
No.

254
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,712
They're alive now, both of them.

255
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,382
Not perfect, but well enough.

256
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,719
And they'll be better off
when you're through.

257
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,012
Or not.

258
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:31,396
Abby, this used to be easier.

259
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,151
It was never supposed to be easy.

260
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,446
That's why they needed you.

261
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,823
What do you need?

262
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,576
I need you

263
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,787
to tell me

264
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,708
that I can do this.

265
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,670
Of course, you can.

266
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:01,301
If I hadn't believed in you,
I wouldn't even be here.

267
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,910
Gentlemen.

268
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:29,955
Ladies.

269
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,209
They are Russian.

270
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,420
They are 16 years old.

271
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:43,885
They have led until this day, a life of
slavery, exploitation, and humiliation.

272
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,598
They're what we in the medical profession
call omphalopagus twins,

273
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:52,727
joined by a band of cartilage
and soft tissue in their midsection.

274
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,814
Through extensive examination,

275
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:59,734
I have concluded that
the only organ they share is the liver.

276
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,988
It is our intention today
to separate the girls,

277
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,156
leaving each of them enough of the liver,

278
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:09,494
so that it can regenerate over time
and continue normal function.

279
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,247
This is their last day
as a sideshow attraction,

280
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,457
and you their last audience.

281
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,879
This is no magic trick.

282
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:24,259
No illusion. No sleight of hand.

283
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,762
It is scientific knowledge

284
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:33,476
and rigorous experimentation that will
finally allow these two young ladies

285
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:38,231
to live the humane life
of which fate has so far robbed them.

286
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,443
They're ready.

287
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,458
Nurse Elkins, surgical knife.

288
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,397
In opening up the girls,

289
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:24,319
we discovered a delicate prolongation
of liver substance in the connecting band.

290
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,077
At this point, the liver is fully exposed
and Dr. Gallinger is placing a clamp

291
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:36,372
on the hepatoduodenal ligament,
which greatly decreases the bleeding.

292
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:43,838
Once the liver was bisected, each team
began the delicate task of suturing.

293
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:50,595
It's difficult to see in this motion film,
but I devised a new type of suture

294
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,723
based on my research
and work with sailing knots.

295
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,936
This new suture,
which I named the Gallinger Knot,

296
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,022
did an excellent job of joining tissue.

297
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:04,901
Now, Nika, the girl whom
Dr. Edwards and I were working on,

298
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,530
developed a problem in her peritoneum,
which we had to address.

299
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,576
Her abdominal cavity was
thoroughly washed of any escaping fluids

300
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,120
to avoid shock.

301
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:18,706
And to help in this, we had to make an
opening in the Pouch of Douglas.

302
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:26,923
The entire operation
took three and a half hours.

303
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,884
The girls are resting comfortably.

304
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,972
So far, Nika has a slight case
of postoperative pneumonia,

305
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,723
which we are monitoring.

306
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,811
This surgery, gentlemen, proves once again

307
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:44,023
how high we can soar
on the wings of science and ingenuity.

308
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,159
What is this material?

309
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,911
Celluloid. Amazing substance.

310
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,290
Thicker pieces can actually
be molded into objects.

311
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:04,878
I know one fellow who makes jewelry out of it
and fools people into thinking it's real ivory.

312
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,101
Hello, Neely.

313
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,813
I have something for you.
For the ball tonight.

314
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:26,608
- Well, can it wait, please?
- No.

315
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,321
- How did you...
- Put them on.

316
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:43,917
I had my man contact the jeweler
to whom you sold them in San Francisco,

317
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,044
and I purchased them back.

318
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,547
I wanted you to have them then,

319
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,925
and I want you to have them now.

320
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,636
They're too beautiful for anyone else.

321
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,430
Thank you.

322
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:03,728
I also had this made as a complement.

323
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,991
Hmm. Marvelous.

324
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:22,121
I always told you
I would treat you like a daughter.

325
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,166
And haven't I?

326
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,837
You've been very kind.

327
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,299
Both you and Mrs. Showalter.

328
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,469
Then what more do you want?

329
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,847
I don't want anything.

330
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:44,644
Because I've given you everything,
and still it's not enough for you.

331
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,231
We had a bargain.

332
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:54,195
I would bring you back to New York,
and you would stop your running around.

333
00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:00,410
You swore you would give your full attention
to the needs of my son and this family.

334
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,120
Your family.

335
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,914
- And I have.
- You've done no such thing.

336
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:10,295
You've barely attended any of the meetings
of the ball committee.

337
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:15,049
Instead, you've been sneaking around
like a thief in the night,

338
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:19,512
scurrying like a rat,
investigating your dead inspector.

339
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:23,808
- You've had someone following me.
- And for good reason.

340
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:28,604
- You don't understand what I...
- You should be pregnant!

341
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,275
Did he threaten you?

342
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,653
- No.
- Then what happened?

343
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:39,073
I just want to leave this house
and never come back.

344
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:42,744
My father isn't a man you want to upset.

345
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,746
I don't care.

346
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,581
And neither would I.

347
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:48,958
But you know I think the
world of your father,

348
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:52,628
and we need to make sure
that he is protected.

349
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,047
From what?

350
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,507
From you.

351
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,509
Excuse me?

352
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03,181
He owes my father
an enormous amount of money.

353
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:06,142
His investment is all that's keeping
Robertson Shipping afloat.

354
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:08,853
He could call your father's note.

355
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,482
Even the rumor of a rift between our families
would send the stock plummeting.

356
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,485
Wolves would eat him for breakfast
on the exchange.

357
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:20,365
I... I never even thought...

358
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:23,076
That's where I have to think for both of us.

359
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:27,372
If we run from my father and his fortune now,

360
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:31,417
there'll be no fortune of your father's
for us to run to. Not for very long.

361
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,338
There are a dozen ways the Showalters
could ruin the Robertsons,

362
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,924
and never give it a second thought.

363
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,056
So, what do we do?

364
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,524
What did my father ask of you?

365
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,945
To make you happy.

366
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,991
Then make me happy.

367
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,954
How does it go up there? Can you lose it?

368
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,081
No, you place it right in there.

369
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,750
Give it a little soak in olive oil first.

370
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,669
What if the fella has some sick on him?

371
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,921
A disease? A rubber's your best chance.

372
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,757
A Goodyear, but they're hard to come by.

373
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:26,764
People been making good Johnny sheaths
out of animal intestines for years.

374
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:29,517
Just got to find somebody
who can make it right.

375
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,146
Pardon me.

376
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,940
- I didn't know you was having tea.
- We're not.

377
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,526
I'm teaching them
how to protect themselves from men.

378
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,238
Yeah, well,
three swift boot heels to the scrotum,

379
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,199
he'd rather be humping a beehive
and never come near you again.

380
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:51,581
What do you use to
not get pregnant with him?

381
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,959
Nothing.

382
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,753
We're just sharing the place for now.
That's it.

383
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:58,921
Sure.

384
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,382
What's the occasion?

385
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:06,429
Oh, ah... There's a big to-do charity ball
for the hospital tonight.

386
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,308
Figured there ain't a chance in hell
of me and Harry getting invited,

387
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,852
so why not have a little hooley
of our own right here?

388
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,813
- If that's all right with you, Harry.
- I suppose.

389
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:18,900
All right, I'll get started
on these chops, then.

390
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,490
Well, so far I've seen three Phippses,

391
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,117
two Gould heirs, Van Rensselaers,

392
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:29,577
Lina Astor.

393
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,538
We might be the only two
working men in this whole room.

394
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,332
Imagine how I feel.

395
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:37,919
I don't get to wear ball gowns
very often in my line of work.

396
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:41,005
Opal, you look like
you were born to wear dresses like that.

397
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,340
I was.

398
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,050
But I'm really here for the entertainment.

399
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,260
They have Williams & Walker
performing tonight.

400
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,138
I took Opal to see them, and we
haven't stopped talking about them since.

401
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:52,683
We already have tickets
for their new show on Broadway.

402
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,212
I'm fighting Wingo tooth and nail,
but he simply will not yield to reason.

403
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,549
Changes at every turn,
slowing the workers to a crawl.

404
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:27,218
It's been frightfully
expensive for all of us.

405
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,553
- Fire him.
- Agreed.

406
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:32,890
Of course, I expected this might happen,
so I've been holding back much of his fee.

407
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,267
Well done, Mr. Barrow.

408
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,601
Shall I give him the boot now?

409
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:36,727
You can do it in the morning.

410
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,980
Let Michelangelo have his last dance.

411
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,940
- Gentlemen.
- Gentlemen.

412
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,401
Victoria.

413
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:46,112
Hobie, Eunice, I hope
you're enjoying our festivities.

414
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,531
It's a lovely evening.

415
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,325
Cornelia, you have outdone yourself.

416
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,327
Yes, you have, my dear.

417
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,205
Your talents are endless.

418
00:31:56,707 --> 00:32:00,668
All of those many meetings you attended
certainly have paid off.

419
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,670
Thank you.

420
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:07,675
Didn't I tell you that being a leading woman
of New York society would be rewarding?

421
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,469
And you were right as usual, Eunice.

422
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:12,555
Cornelia.

423
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,057
Oh, thank you for your advice, Eunice.

424
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:19,145
I hope, Father, that with
so many immigrants coming in,

425
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:22,106
the new Knick will still have
room for the poor in its beds.

426
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:28,946
We'll still have wards, but now they'll be
offset by a majority of patients of real means.

427
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:34,577
Your father is a businessman, Cornelia,
but one with a vulnerable heart.

428
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,622
Let's hope not too vulnerable.

429
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:42,418
Well, yours might not be the only
vulnerable heart in the family, Captain.

430
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:43,961
Oh.

431
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:47,006
Your plate's
got more bones than a graveyard.

432
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,593
Ah, don't say it like that.
I won't have a stomach for the afters.

433
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,845
There's afters? Where you gonna put it all?

434
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,472
I'll make room.

435
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,812
There, now I have a little pouch
for some cobbler.

436
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,606
Hey, I was thinking

437
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,610
about those ladies you was with today

438
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:12,406
and their needing your knowledge
on contraception and all.

439
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,743
There's not a lot out there for women

440
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,329
to protect themselves
against a horny gent, huh?

441
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,499
Fellas are always looking
to empty the bag in a girl.

442
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:25,419
Never thinking about what comes after.
Babies and diseases for a start.

443
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,754
And there it is.

444
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,007
Why don't we give it to them? Hmm?

445
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:31,717
Do 'em a service.

446
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,178
Another business proposition?

447
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,764
Yeah. Our last one was working fine.

448
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:40,017
Until I nearly got 20 years in prison.

449
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:44,397
Yeah, rubbers and stuff is
illegal, but it's not like doing the fix.

450
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:45,940
It's more like frowned upon.

451
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,733
I've been frowned upon enough.

452
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:49,443
And the penalty's just as tough.

453
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,446
The ladies need it. The fellas do, too.

454
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:55,491
If he's gonna put it inside there anyways,

455
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,869
we'd be doing a lot of good
helping a bloke bag it up on the way in.

456
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,871
And besides, we ain't going back to the fix,

457
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:04,959
so why not stop the trouble
before it gets that far?

458
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,297
- It wouldn't be that difficult.
- Mmm-hmm.

459
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,800
You'd need lamb's guts for the condoms.

460
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,052
Vinegar and sponges for the ladies.

461
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:16,804
Yeah, could charge a fortune.

462
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,557
This city is full of customers.

463
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,517
Lord knows that's true.

464
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,311
And the split. Fifty-fifty
this time, or nothing.

465
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:28,816
Fair play.

466
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,819
Okay.

467
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:49,170
I can't tell you what seeing you
in that dress does to me.

468
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,715
You can tell me.

469
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:57,595
But you're gonna have to wait
to see if you can do anything about it.

470
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:01,599
If I could, I'd leave here now
and take you straight back...

471
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,184
But you can't.

472
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,480
I'm here to dance and be doted upon.

473
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,358
So, I certainly hope you can keep me happy.

474
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:13,819
Without a doubt.

475
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,823
You can start with a drink.

476
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,619
What would Mademoiselle desire?

477
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:24,872
You're the expert.

478
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,727
Uh, two Whiskey Flips, please.

479
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,732
- Ah.
- She's a real beauty.

480
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,069
If you only knew.

481
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,154
Jesus.

482
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:00,825
Oh, how was Ohio?
Did you solve your oil problem?

483
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,159
I might have.

484
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:05,579
See, we've always refined crude into kerosene

485
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,790
and thrown away the waste
that we strip down.

486
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:11,001
It was flammable, so we piped it
into rivers and lakes, just to be safe.

487
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,503
Well, that's only responsible.

488
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,172
But we needed a new idea,

489
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:19,343
and I just thought
we could find a use for that waste, too.

490
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,304
So, I hired some chemists and engineers.

491
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:25,850
They've converted all the machines
at the refinery to run on the stuff.

492
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,101
Not steam?

493
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:31,021
Or electricity. It's miraculous.
We call it gasoline.

494
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:35,234
You look absolutely stunning. That dress.

495
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:39,363
Henry's complimented me 100 times.
It's worth every penny.

496
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,866
Well, my brother can never say no
to a pretty girl,

497
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,451
and you're the prettiest in the room.

498
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,287
Thank you, Cornelia.

499
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,040
Lucy, I want you to have a good time tonight.

500
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,877
I plan to.

501
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,755
I know you're new to all this,
and you shouldn't be.

502
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:01,010
You belong here,
and maybe you even belong with my brother.

503
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:05,806
But I don't want you to be crushed
when this is all over.

504
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:08,601
And you think there will be an end?

505
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:13,814
You know how fond I am of you.
I'm saying this for your own sake.

506
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,570
You're an innocent girl and
I don't want you to be taken in by him,

507
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,948
for you to surrender anything
because you believe there's a future.

508
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:24,992
Why wouldn't there be?

509
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,369
For an endless number of reasons.

510
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:30,789
And I can see you're getting your hopes up.

511
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:34,585
I think it's Henry whose hopes
are quite high right now.

512
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:38,255
My father has expectations for his children.

513
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,926
Of whom I was to marry, and likewise Henry.

514
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,638
I'm sure he does. Excuse me.

515
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,770
I better like it.

516
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,981
If you don't, I'll get
you something different.

517
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,323
Look.

518
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,289
Thank you.

519
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,921
They're all looking at me.

520
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,715
Why wouldn't they? You're beautiful.

521
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,303
I'm an oddity.

522
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,849
But I don't care.

523
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,435
I love being on your arm again.

524
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,690
Well, get used to it because
there's no place I won't be taking you.

525
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,239
Good evening.
Lovely to see you.

526
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,157
- You as well.
- My wife Opal.

527
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,535
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

528
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,290
Whoop!

529
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,543
- Cheers.
- To a lovely evening.

530
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,729
Good evening, everyone.

531
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:20,232
On behalf of the Knickerbocker Hospital
and the ladies' ball committee,

532
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:24,903
we want to thank you all for being here
and for giving so generously.

533
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:31,660
I asked my husband, Herman,

534
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:34,538
what would make tonight special
for all of our guests,

535
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,540
and he said rye whiskey.

536
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,333
I said that.

537
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,252
Instead, we thought we would
start with some entertainment.

538
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,379
And they're famous all over the nation.

539
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:46,050
And some of you have seen them
at Koster and Bial's Music Hall.

540
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:50,637
And they're soon to appear on Broadway in
In Dahomey.

541
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,640
The original cakewalkers,

542
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:57,227
the Two Real Coons, Williams & Walker.

543
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,463
That's right, we Two Real Coons.

544
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:28,342
Ain't be no ivory under here.
This is all dripping chocolate.

545
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,887
- Don't you got childrens?
- Sure, I got 'em.

546
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,889
Named all my children after flowers.

547
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:37,684
There's Lily, Rose, and my son Artificial.

548
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,939
- Don't you gots a job?
- Gots a bad one.

549
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:45,609
But they say the ugliest kinds of trades
has their moments of pleasure.

550
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,111
And I believes it.

551
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:50,989
'Cause if I was a hangman or a gravedigger,

552
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:55,285
I could get some sure enough enjoyment
working for certain folks I know.

553
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,097
Thank you.

554
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:26,478
- Beautiful night.
- Oh, lovely.

555
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:27,813
Are you warm enough, my dear?

556
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:31,692
Oh, I believe that last sherry
is keeping me quite toasty.

557
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:37,948
Algie.

558
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,993
- What an evening indeed.
- Aww.

559
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,744
It was spectacular.

560
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:48,333
I am so glad to have you here with us,
sharing the Knick and these times together.

561
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:51,670
You know,
you've always been family to me, Captain.

562
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:56,216
And I am expecting some little ones
from you two very soon.

563
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,178
Now, you've never disappointed me
in any other area.

564
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,681
Don't let me down now.

565
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,143
So, Captain, where does Algie stand
in regard to the new hospital?

566
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:10,355
I just told you how I feel about the boy.
I've championed him every step of the way.

567
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,982
But will he have a prominent position?

568
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,984
Opal, it's not the time.

569
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,986
You deserve an answer, Algernon.

570
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,239
- Oh, I think our carriage is here.
- I'm sure he'll wait for you.

571
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,284
Captain?

572
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:29,458
My God.

573
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:32,836
I am fighting for you, Algie. Believe me.

574
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,338
Henry and I both are.

575
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:35,547
So...

576
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:41,386
I may have no position at all
at the new hospital?

577
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,473
What about Negro patients?

578
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:53,273
Our people can entertain you,
and you shower them with platitudes,

579
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:56,026
but in the end,
you are no different from the rest of them.

580
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,321
Mrs. Edwards, I believe
we've heard enough out of you.

581
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:02,366
My husband is as generous as they come.

582
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,950
Towards some people.

583
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,118
I...

584
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:11,124
I'm not funding the hospital by myself.

585
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,835
And if you must know,

586
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,172
I don't have the money
to fund my own part anymore.

587
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,842
I am reliant on other donors,

588
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:24,221
and that's what they want.

589
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:27,307
I could have done 100 other things
with that money,

590
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,643
but I wanted to help people.

591
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:34,106
As far as I can tell,
you're not helping anyone at all.

592
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:38,402
So, perhaps you'll understand
if I don't want to remain here

593
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,946
to endure your disdain any longer.

594
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,201
I am very sorry

595
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,330
that I've disappointed you, son.

596
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:55,168
I will do everything I can

597
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:57,587
to assure your position.

598
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,300
Victoria.

599
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:05,637
You ruined my night.

600
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:17,399
I'm going to do what I can, Jesse.

601
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,151
I expect you will.

602
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:30,203
"The only lion I is a-taming
is the dandelion."

603
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:34,040
You have another profession
if you ever get tired of medicine.

604
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,460
We should get tickets for the play.
Would you like that?

605
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,628
I would. Very much.

606
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,550
Here we are.

607
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:46,094
Together again.

608
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,097
Are you surprised?

609
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:50,557
Not a bit.

610
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,435
Well, that's because nothing surprises you.

611
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,229
Because I've never loved anyone but you.

612
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:03,320
There is something about Abigail Healey
that has completely enchanted me

613
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,697
from the very first moment I saw you.

614
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,241
Well, I certainly hope it wasn't my nose.

615
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:14,122
Is there anything more you could do to it?

616
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:16,708
Like what?

617
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:21,087
Well, straighten it.
Or fix the ragged edge right here.

618
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:24,090
It still bothers you that much?

619
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:27,427
I'd like to think
I was bigger than that, but...

620
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:32,557
Being at the ball and
seeing all those beautiful women...

621
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:36,978
Even with all your compliments,
I still just don't feel right.

622
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,941
I know I shouldn't complain.

623
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,568
- It's so much better than it was.
- No, no, no, I understand.

624
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:46,738
I'll look into it.
I'm sure I can do something.

625
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:49,199
But I have to say,

626
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,494
I like this one just fine.

627
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:06,258
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

628
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:07,801
What's wrong?

629
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,388
Am I hurting you?

630
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,682
You want me to be more gentle?

631
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:39,082
Now we can really fuck.

632
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,334
Lie back and I'll show you what I like.

633
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,349
Isn't that better?

634
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,240
Thank you, Mr. Fester.

635
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,118
Mr. Wingo,

636
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:20,290
this will serve as your letter of termination,
but it will also serve as insurance.

637
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,625
For what?

638
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,919
I know how your type thinks.

639
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:28,590
You want to look for opportunity
for petty revenge.

640
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,884
An anonymous letter,
a word to the hospital board

641
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,012
about the way
I've conducted my business dealings.

642
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:37,140
I think you now have a good idea

643
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,685
of the price you'll pay
for any and all indiscretions.

644
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:45,857
Today, you're only swallowing a few teeth,
tomorrow it could be much worse.

645
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,651
Fuck you.

646
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:53,406
You want to try that again?

647
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,450
I understand.

648
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,868
Very good.

649
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:01,748
What makes this one procedure
different from all others?

650
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:15,595
This is the last place
I expected to see you today.

651
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,682
It seems
I missed one minstrel show at the ball.

652
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:21,518
I couldn't pass up the opportunity
to see another.

653
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:29,025
Now that I've made the transverse elliptical
incision around the hernia and the umbilicus,

654
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:32,737
I will now deepen it
to the base of the hernial intrusion.

655
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:01,516
Nurse Ryan, suction wand.

656
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,909
I now need to clear the muscles
attached to the aponeurotic membrane

657
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:23,913
by a half an inch in all directions
from the hernial sac.

658
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:27,917
These muscles tend to be quite rigid,
so to alleviate that,

659
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:31,337
I'll inject them with a solution of 2% curare

660
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,048
as a relaxant.

661
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:35,341
Syringe.

662
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,298
I will now divide the fibrous
and peritoneal membranes

663
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,966
using a circular manner at the neck.

664
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,010
This will expose its contents

665
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,722
and allow me to see
if there's any intestinal viscera present.

666
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:25,892
Dr. Edwards,
his breathing is rapid and shallow.

667
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:29,604
Check his airway. Is it anaphylaxis?

668
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,272
No, it's clear.

669
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:34,400
No redness or swelling
anywhere that I can see.

670
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,699
No palpitations.
It's not a reaction to an allergen.

671
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,576
He stopped breathing.

672
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:47,664
Let me think this through.

673
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:49,332
It's his heart.
Has he had a problem with it before?

674
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,834
No, nothing.

675
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,418
There's a weak pulse.

676
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:53,962
No breathing.

677
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:00,385
Don't do a thing.

678
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:05,515
Look at his muscles. They've gone limp.

679
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,977
He's urinated himself, unable
to hold his bladder. He's paralyzed.

680
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:11,271
- The curare?
- It's a paralytic.

681
00:53:12,565 --> 00:53:16,526
No, I only gave him a small dose.
The same amount I always give.

682
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,695
Well, most obviously not.

683
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:20,196
You must have mistakenly
given the wrong dose,

684
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:23,116
rendering nearly every muscle
in his body completely useless.

685
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:27,370
More specifically, his diaphragm.

686
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,206
No, it couldn't be.

687
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:32,500
It's the only thing
that would account for the symptoms.

688
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:37,380
If his heart can keep up this weak beat,
he should be fine once the curare wears off.

689
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,632
We just have to breathe for him until then.

690
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,303
The good knight Gallinger
rides to the rescue.

691
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,601
You should continue on
with your hernia work.

692
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:50,810
I'll keep him alive while you do.

693
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,577
How the hell could it go so wrong,

694
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,914
so fast?

695
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:17,420
Gallinger of all people.

696
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,966
The white knight to the rescue.

697
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,553
The reporters loved it.

698
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:31,184
Argh. This is a disaster.

699
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:38,983
We set out trying to prove one point,
and we wound up proving the opposite.

700
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,536
It's all right, my darling.

701
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:55,291
We're going to have better days.

702
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:06,344
A lot better days.
