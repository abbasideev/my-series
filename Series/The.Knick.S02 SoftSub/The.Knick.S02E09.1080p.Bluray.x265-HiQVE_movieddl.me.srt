http://hiqve.com/

2
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,903
Where are you going?

3
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,707
This isn't yellow fever. This is smallpox.

4
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,834
I know.

5
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:11,088
And you didn't think this was important
information for me to have?

6
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,007
Yellow fever is common.

7
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,886
Rest of the world would not even notice.

8
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,721
But smallpox,

9
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:22,266
would you buy beef or coffee beans
from a country with that?

10
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,979
But I could have brought the vaccine.
Medicines.

11
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,398
I'm equipped for the wrong disease.

12
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,778
You will do as you're told.

13
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:37,740
After all, it was your country that
caused this outbreak in the first place.

14
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,931
Are you American?

15
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,060
Help me. Help me.

16
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,444
John Thackery, Philadelphia.

17
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,238
August Robertson, New York.

18
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,865
I know the name.

19
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,533
What are you doing here?

20
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,326
I'm a doctor.

21
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:26,038
I was working the Mosquito Coast.
They called me in for this.

22
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:29,667
This is the last place I expected to
see a man from the society pages.

23
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,086
My shipping company,
they use Nicaragua as a shortcut

24
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,130
to the West Coast and the Orient and back.

25
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,382
Two weeks crossing this country
saves me two months

26
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,385
in navigation around South America.

27
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,888
So why are they keeping you prisoner?

28
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:45,224
Are you the American that's supposed to have
caused this outbreak?

29
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,727
My shipping company pays them
in trinkets and blankets

30
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,062
and now they're saying
those blankets made them sick.

31
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,315
That's very possible.

32
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,401
- They killed 12 of my men. Mostly Hondurans.
- Hey! Hey!

33
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,153
And they're gonna kill me, I can assure you.

34
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,238
Please, you've got to help me.

35
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,865
You need to let the American go.

36
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,327
He will pay for this disease with his life.

37
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,829
But you can't be sure he's responsible.

38
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:07,997
He stays.

39
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,210
Well, then I won't cure these people.

40
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,630
Then you will end up
like your American friend.

41
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,926
If this thing spreads,
it's the most contagious thing on the Earth.

42
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,054
You let him go, I will save these people.

43
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,353
Without the vaccine?

44
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,689
I have a way.

45
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,903
These are the survivors.

46
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:25,074
They can no longer get the disease.
They're immune.

47
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,827
So they can help us
with those who still have it.

48
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:31,414
Tell them to wrap these
bandages around the skin.

49
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,291
It will help their sores heal.

50
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:59,358
For those who haven't gotten the disease,
this will keep them safe.

51
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,360
They'll get a mild case of it.

52
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:05,656
They'll definitely recover
and they'll never get it again.

53
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:09,493
Even if this does work,
I'm still keeping his cargo.

54
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,336
Girls, you ready?

55
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,530
Good morning, Dr. Gallinger.

56
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:17,496
Detective, what can I do for you?

57
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:21,208
I had some more information
regarding Dr. Cotton's death

58
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,335
that you might be interested in hearing

59
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,881
since, as you said, you and your wife
were so fond of him.

60
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,302
Uh, would you follow me?

61
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,223
What is it?

62
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,727
We've confirmed that he was
most definitely poisoned.

63
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,898
And we now know who did it.

64
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,484
You do?

65
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,654
You might want to prepare yourself.

66
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,158
It was his sons who did him in.

67
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,368
They both were studying at Princeton,

68
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:00,122
were slowly adding arsenic
to their father's meals over time.

69
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,252
You're positive about this?

70
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,879
They confessed it.

71
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,839
They were surprised that he'd died so quickly

72
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:12,468
since, as they said, they had
only been adding the arsenic a short while.

73
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,972
Must have given him more than they realized.
Not that I blame them.

74
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,850
From what I gather, the old man was a nut.

75
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,522
You know, that crazy man
pulled the teeth out of their head.

76
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,985
His own children's teeth.

77
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,363
Why the hell do you do something like that?

78
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,117
He thought it would keep them sane.

79
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,956
Have the boys been arrested?

80
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,125
They killed themselves before we could.

81
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,671
So I guess Daddy's treatment
didn't work out so great.

82
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,883
Anyway, just thought you'd want to know.

83
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,677
Ah. Thank you.

84
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,346
How's your wife?

85
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,432
Doing well.

86
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,018
Give her my best.

87
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,708
Will you excuse us for a moment, Dudley?

88
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,794
Thank you.

89
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,382
Your mother said you're leaving.

90
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:38,929
Going to Ohio tonight.
The refinery is nearly ready.

91
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,098
Talking with some men in Cleveland
and up near Detroit

92
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,726
about using our gasoline
for automotive propulsion.

93
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,562
Well, when will you be back?

94
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,065
Do you really care?

95
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,984
Of course.

96
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,902
'Cause I want you to come with me.

97
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,655
It's a part of my father's business
that could be mine.

98
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,616
I can build it. We can make a life there.

99
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:04,997
Phillip, it's a lot all at once.
I need some time.

100
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:10,669
No, I don't want words or protestations.
It's not what you say, it's what you do.

101
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:14,006
I'm leaving tonight.
I don't know when I'll be back.

102
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,175
Now either you're coming
with me, your husband,

103
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,428
to be with me wherever we end up,
or you're not.

104
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,766
And if you're not,
I'll find someone who wants to.

105
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,727
I deserve at least that.

106
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,620
May I come in?

107
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,589
How are you doing?

108
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,307
I'm deeply sorry, John.

109
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,770
What did you want?

110
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,566
Just wanted to give you
a report on the twins.

111
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,486
Some good news for a change.

112
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,782
Dr. Chickering and I
examined them this morning.

113
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,951
Nika's pneumonia has receded.

114
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:29,081
The amount of albumin
in their urine has decreased.

115
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,209
They're eating full meals and

116
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,670
they took their first steps alone.

117
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,674
Also, the orphanage informs me

118
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,093
that a family from Missouri
has agreed to take the girls.

119
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,761
They arrived in the city yesterday

120
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:46,181
and are just waiting on
our approval to let them go.

121
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,434
I think they're ready.

122
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,478
Sounds like it.

123
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,024
Congratulations.

124
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,439
So, here's what I'm thinking.

125
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,942
We start at the East Side piers.

126
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,361
Find some sailors coming back
from a long time at sea

127
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,988
looking to get their logs dunked.

128
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,532
Then we head to 29th Street.

129
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:49,578
They've got enough brothels and dance halls
to keep us selling till Christmas.

130
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,871
Fine.

131
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,001
How long you gonna be sore with me?

132
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,337
As long as I feel like.

133
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,923
I may not be a nun anymore,
but I took my vows,

134
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,258
vows that you know I intend on keeping.

135
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:07,387
It was one little kiss, all right?
A kiss I didn't even get.

136
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:11,058
You're a hound,
like all them fellas getting off the boats

137
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,268
looking to get their logs dunked.

138
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,522
I can't trust you now,
just like I shouldn't have all this time.

139
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,525
I got carried away is all.

140
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,111
Because what I said is true.

141
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,782
I do have feelings for you.

142
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,413
Then I'd ask you to please
keep them to yourself.

143
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,750
This box is ready.

144
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,088
Guess those vows
didn't include one of forgiveness.

145
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,172
What?

146
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,840
Nothing, all right? I'm sorry.

147
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,468
I didn't mean to tempt you
into breaking your vows.

148
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:51,223
Believe me, a gorilla like you,
there wasn't the least bit of temptation.

149
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,115
Mr. Jenkins.

150
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,076
- Herman Barrow.
- Good to meet you, Mr. Barrow.

151
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,828
And you, sir.

152
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,496
- Shall we?
- Yes.

153
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:32,264
Thank you, Mr. Barrow.
Welcome to the Metropolitan Club.

154
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,701
I don't know what a Vander is,
but I'm sho glad he done built it.

155
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,412
Herman, how are you?

156
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,289
I'm very well, Corky, thank you.

157
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,375
That was a wonderful evening. Please.

158
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,710
Oh.

159
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,465
Well, we very much appreciated
your generous donation.

160
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,729
Dr. Thackery?

161
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,442
Dr. Thackery, it's Nurse Baker.

162
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,820
The twins are leaving.
I thought you'd want to know.

163
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:53,595
Where is Dr. Thackery?
We want to say goodbye.

164
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,934
I'm sure he wishes he could be here,
but unfortunately he's elsewhere.

165
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,023
Be well, girls.

166
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,617
Finally, a good outcome.

167
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:24,459
Well, I don't suppose he's rushing over
for one last wave at the twins.

168
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,670
You brought me up on charges?

169
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,796
What?

170
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,216
I've been called to defend myself
in front of the state medical board.

171
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,260
You sterilized idiots?

172
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,845
Dozens.

173
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,472
I had no idea how far outside

174
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,349
the brotherhood of physicians
you were until now.

175
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:43,437
And I had no idea how far outside you were
until you sabotaged me.

176
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,855
How?

177
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,025
The Carr surgery. I know it was you.

178
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,194
Why? Because there's no chance
you would ever make a mistake?

179
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,406
No, because there is no chance that
you are a better doctor than I am.

180
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,242
Oh, for God's sake. Shut up, both of you.

181
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,953
Everett, you're supposed to be on the ward.

182
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,875
Have I missed the twins?

183
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,753
Just. They asked after you.

184
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,423
Thack! Thack!

185
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,341
Quick, quick, fetch a gurney.

186
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,426
No.

187
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,803
You have been in pain for weeks.
You need to be examined.

188
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,222
You mean opened up? Like hell.

189
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,267
All right, well, maybe there's
another alternative.

190
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,225
Have a look, doctors.

191
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,730
My Lord.

192
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,276
You do realize the patient is conscious,
don't you, Bertie?

193
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,988
I was marveling at the technology.

194
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:22,452
Zinberg taught you to tell the truth.
I taught you to lie.

195
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,956
Seems like neither of us did a very good job.

196
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,834
It is a marvelous invention.

197
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,335
And what does it tell you?

198
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,921
That a section of your bowel is ischemic.

199
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,589
Agreed.

200
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:38,051
I suppose we can guess what's caused it.

201
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,303
Well, we don't need to get into that.

202
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,097
No, that's all right.

203
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,933
A man ingests cocaine for long enough,

204
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,562
then his intestinal blood vessels
don't stand a chance.

205
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,857
You'll need a resection.

206
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,861
Is the entire intestine necrotic?

207
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,948
Well, we can only guess
from what little we can see,

208
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,742
but I'll schedule surgery
as soon as possible.

209
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:06,162
No, I want to find an alternative.

210
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,081
What do you mean?

211
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,292
I don't want to rush into it.

212
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:15,297
There are other things I want to try.

213
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,925
- Medications.
- You collapsed on the street.

214
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:21,469
Your bowel looks like the badlands.

215
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,971
What more evidence do you need?

216
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,848
No medication is gonna repair that.

217
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,268
Yet it is not for any of you to decide.

218
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,690
Ladies, I am kindly asking you
to please stay out of my way.

219
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,984
I will go wherever I please.

220
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:40,614
These nurses are saying
I am barred from the building.

221
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:44,826
You need to make an appointment
like everyone else.

222
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,871
I am not everyone else.

223
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,793
Thank you, nurses. Everything is fine.

224
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,464
Please close the door.

225
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,473
How's your whore? Is she well?

226
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,559
Junia is very well. Thank you.

227
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:14,689
And how's your new apartment?
Tiny and awful, I trust?

228
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,442
Actually, that's why I'm here.

229
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:22,656
I want you to buy me a big,
nice one with a view like yours

230
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,950
for me and the children.

231
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,786
Preferably on the Upper East Side.

232
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,580
In a dream, that might be
something I would do.

233
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,917
By law, I owe you nothing.

234
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,807
What is that?

235
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:52,268
Apparently,
it's the actual amount of steel

236
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,939
that was delivered to the new Knick
on March 4, 1901.

237
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,817
I'm assuming that somewhere in this building

238
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:02,529
is a document claiming that the delivery
was much greater,

239
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,949
as was the amount that you required
the hospital to pay for it.

240
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,994
We'll both just suppose
we know where the extra money went.

241
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:11,913
Where did you get that?

242
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,082
You keep
excellent records, Herman.

243
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,626
And you were very smart to keep them
out of the hospital

244
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:18,378
where people could find them.

245
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:24,175
Unfortunately, when I went
to the bank the other day to retrieve jewelry

246
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,594
from my safe-deposit box to sell it,

247
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:32,392
the banker mistakenly gave me the keys
to the other Barrow box.

248
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,896
Where are they now, the papers?

249
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,898
In a new safe-deposit box.

250
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:45,405
They're all there, everything you did
and every penny you stole.

251
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,118
What do you want?

252
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,164
I want to live the life
I was accustomed to living.

253
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,542
I want the children back in their schools.

254
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,336
I want the apartment I mentioned.

255
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,631
I want you to suffer.

256
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,595
And I want you to pay me
until the day you die.

257
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,014
How much?

258
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,809
Half. Paid to me every month.

259
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,191
All right. Half my salary.

260
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:26,404
And half of everything you steal, skim,
and ferret away.

261
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,121
Over that, you can go fuck yourself.

262
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:39,084
And I'd advise you to find someone else
that wants to fuck you, too,

263
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,669
because I'm only paying for five years.

264
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,421
After that,

265
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,132
you're on your own.

266
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,552
So start casting about
for men with deep pockets,

267
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:54,974
poor eyesight, and very little need
for proper sexual gratification.

268
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,701
I've sped up the crews

269
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:17,205
and I believe we'll soon be back on schedule.

270
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:20,041
Are you sure that's wise?

271
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,043
To rush the crews?

272
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,587
Perhaps we should slow them a bit.

273
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,632
I... I worry about accidents.

274
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,468
As do I,
which is why there won't be any.

275
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:34,889
He won't cooperate.
He's a by-the-book operator.

276
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,058
He's cutting costs.

277
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:40,728
Wants to bring the project in under
budget from here on out.

278
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,148
- What kind of fruit does that?
- Exactly.

279
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,442
So, we have our normal arrangement?

280
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:50,155
Look, Herm, I could bust the guy up,
but what's the point?

281
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,324
- The building's nearly done.
- Let's at least slow it down.

282
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,410
We gotta let it get built sometime.

283
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,538
If we didn't, they wouldn't build the
next one and we couldn't skim off that.

284
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,666
There is no next one. This is it for me.

285
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,544
I have expenses, Jimmy.

286
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,172
You might pull a few more bucks
out of the building,

287
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,340
but short of finding a way
to turn back the clock

288
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,384
and start the whole project over again,

289
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,178
I'd say find another scheme.

290
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,888
I am not giving up.

291
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,017
There are a lot more ways to game this
and I will find them.

292
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,938
I wish you luck, Herm.
And when you do, don't forget our cut.

293
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,398
Yeah.

294
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:34,073
Do you have a moment? It's rather urgent.

295
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:36,075
What is it?

296
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,286
It's the new man.

297
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,580
The architect, Mr. Warren.

298
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:44,250
From what I can tell, he's whipping
us into shape nicely.

299
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,502
Yes. Very efficient.

300
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:52,759
But I fear there may be some pitfalls
involved in all of that whipping.

301
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,928
Such as?

302
00:25:55,012 --> 00:26:00,391
Such as the cheapening of quality, for one.
He's using fewer joists, thinner materials.

303
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:04,145
I'm more than happy
to have less of everything.

304
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:08,107
Everything, including costs.

305
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:11,819
Yes, but with the demands he is placing

306
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,781
on these crews, the speed he wants,

307
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:18,326
the dangers are immense.

308
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,247
With all that we have poured into that place,

309
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,792
to have it destroyed
by some terrible calamity...

310
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,296
Warren and his firm have an excellent record.

311
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:32,924
The Astors' hotel was a triumph.

312
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:36,344
I appreciate your caution,
but we're backing him.

313
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,723
Of course.

314
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,351
I'm sure you're right.

315
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:46,771
Mrs. Showalter. Lovely to see you.

316
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,856
And you, Mr. Barrow.

317
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,115
So?

318
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,539
I've tried 100 different ways to find
the holes in this.

319
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,166
I didn't want to believe it either.

320
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,298
It's not in Dad's nature.

321
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,175
I know.

322
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,890
But when I stop looking at him
as just his son,

323
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,979
there is a desperation to him now.

324
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:32,108
But actual murder?

325
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,280
So what do we do?

326
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,409
I mean, go to the police?

327
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,790
Well, we can't just have
them come to the door

328
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,625
and march him out into some jail.

329
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,503
We need to confront him first.

330
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:58,885
Allow him to get his affairs in order.
Turn himself in with dignity.

331
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:06,017
And we need to have him look us in the eye
and admit what he's done.

332
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:12,565
I suppose it would make it feel
like less of a betrayal that way.

333
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:19,572
He asked me to meet him at
the construction site at 8:00.

334
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,617
Do you think you can be there, too,

335
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,869
so we can confront him together?

336
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,579
Of course.

337
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:30,333
What I found in my investigation
of Dr. Gallinger...

338
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:34,045
By investigation,
you mean breaking into my office

339
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,630
and stealing patient records.

340
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,049
So what you found in your thievery.

341
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:42,387
What I found is that Dr. Gallinger

342
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:46,557
has performed dozens of unauthorized
vasectomies on children,

343
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,560
children who had no say in their
permanent alteration

344
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:54,899
and all in service of some harebrained theory
that has no proven basis in medical science.

345
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,070
Dr. Gallinger, your defense.

346
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,865
I plead guilty, Dr. Phelps.

347
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:07,328
Guilty to believing what I believe
in doing what I have done.

348
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,499
So you did alter these boys?

349
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,877
Of course. And I stand by it.

350
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:21,008
Cripples, imbeciles, criminals, defectives...

351
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,056
I spare the world from their line
in order to benefit the greater good.

352
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:33,563
What gives a man the right to play God?

353
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,568
Deciding who is hereditarily fit
and who unworthy to bear children?

354
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:42,530
What Dr. Gallinger did was an act of egotism,

355
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,409
of cruelty, and of malpractice.

356
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,287
As his superior at the Knickerbocker,

357
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,456
it is my recommendation that this board

358
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,126
considers a full revocation
of Dr. Gallinger's credentials.

359
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,963
What Edwards has left out
of his mongrelization-loving diatribe

360
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:03,968
is that full permission was granted
on every single procedure

361
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,929
on every single one of those boys.

362
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,474
Let me introduce Dr. Samuel Reid.

363
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,310
Good afternoon, doctors.

364
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:15,480
Dr. Reid is the director of the Idiot House
on Randall's Island.

365
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:16,898
I am indeed.

366
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:20,735
I have state guardianship
of all the boys in my home

367
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,572
and I did, in fact,
grant Dr. Gallinger full permission

368
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,282
to perform these procedures.

369
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,159
You have papers to substantiate all of this?

370
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,660
Of course.

371
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:34,832
Dr. Gallinger and I have a similar philosophy
when it comes to these matters.

372
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:38,211
Oh, so this quackery
is now sanctioned by the state.

373
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:39,670
Wonderful.

374
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:43,549
What Edwards and other people
of his kind cannot accept

375
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,970
is there is great validity
in the eugenics movement.

376
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,556
States such as California and Indiana

377
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:53,726
are already seeing the benefits
of a purified society

378
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,354
and are considering writing
it into their legislation.

379
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:01,359
This movement is growing faster
than any other in modern medicine.

380
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:06,531
But men like Edwards
likely also buried their heads

381
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,200
when other revolutions
arose, like germ theory,

382
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:14,372
vaccinations, things that proved
over time to be miracles.

383
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,877
Now, if the board sees fit to prevent me
from practicing in New York,

384
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:24,382
there are hundreds of other institutions

385
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:28,302
and doctors whom I'm sure
would welcome me.

386
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,014
Thank you, Dr. Gallinger.

387
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,309
Dr. Edwards,

388
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,188
how much have you studied
the eugenics movement?

389
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:45,027
I've read several articles in Lancet
and in other medical journals.

390
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:48,447
And you believe that's enough
to discredit an entire field of study?

391
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,575
A field which is now being taught

392
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,119
in hundreds of medical
schools and universities?

393
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:57,456
This isn't about a field of study.

394
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,959
It is about intention.

395
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:03,629
But Dr. Gallinger's intentions
were, in his words,

396
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,089
"For the greater good."

397
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,924
Yes, but for the greater good of whom?

398
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,302
Himself?

399
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,804
You, Dr. Phelps?

400
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,055
Mankind.

401
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:18,519
Eugenics is, in my opinion, a very legitimate
and necessary study.

402
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:22,982
So much so, I've added it to the curriculum
at my own Columbia Medical College.

403
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,569
You broke into his office
and you accused him of doing something

404
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,571
to which he apparently had every right.

405
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,700
Unless my colleagues differ
from me in their opinions,

406
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,494
I see no reason to grant your request.

407
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,458
I see.

408
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,712
Thank you, Doctor.

409
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,050
Thank you.

410
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:51,344
Thank you.

411
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,278
You really intend on doing this?

412
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,285
You realize you're just proving
my entire thesis?

413
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:29,215
I just made a logical and scientific argument

414
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:33,636
and respected, learned men agreed with me

415
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,180
because whether you like it or not,

416
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:41,394
this field of study is legitimate
and it's not going away.

417
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,437
It is fact.

418
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,067
Of course, instead of being a man of science,

419
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,654
you raise your fists like an animal,

420
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,782
the animal we are proving your people to be.

421
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,703
In the face of intellectual reason,

422
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:02,373
you can't help but resort to violence.

423
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,378
Well, I won't.

424
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,674
'Cause the fight is already...

425
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:21,642
Now you just proved it again, stupid nigger.

426
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,985
Dorothy!

427
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,489
- Dorothy!
- Everett?

428
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:38,325
- What is it?
- I won.

429
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:42,079
I beat that dusky bastard every which way.

430
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,665
I tamed the goddamn beast.

431
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,292
Did you go for his eye?

432
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,169
Like a hammer to a nail.

433
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,629
He had no idea I knew.

434
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,176
Let's go upstairs.

435
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,680
Take me right here.

436
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,063
It don't matter
if she's a cock-trough whore

437
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:09,690
or dressed up like a dog's dinner.

438
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,609
You can't tell a thing by
looking at 'em, fellas.

439
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,778
They maybe got it, and maybe they don't.

440
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,781
But these will keep you from getting
the bug no matter what.

441
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,449
You want to lose your nose?

442
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,452
Your ears? Your toes?
'Cause you didn't cover up your bell-end?

443
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,454
You want to be answering
to the name of Daddy?

444
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:27,416
Coupled off to some mistake with
a face like a bulldog chewing a wasp?

445
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:28,793
Now I know what you're thinking.

446
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,213
But pulling out of her cave at the last
second and painting her belly won't save you.

447
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,589
All the docs say so.

448
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,133
There's only one way to go here, fellas,
and it's right here in my hand.

449
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:38,177
Don't slip it in till you slip it on.

450
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:42,640
It's a dime a fuck. 10 in a pack.
Only cost you a buck for 10 rolls in the sack.

451
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,100
Get your money. What are you doing?

452
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,727
I'm out.

453
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:47,895
I barely finished my tout.

454
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,897
I didn't have to say a word.

455
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,169
Look what I have.

456
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,713
Only charge you 15 cents for it.

457
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,758
The rest costs extra.

458
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:13,147
Do you remember Moon Flower?

459
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,526
That old plow mule we had?

460
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,822
I remember how stubborn she was.

461
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,118
We would beat on her and beat on her.

462
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,912
And there came a day finally

463
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,081
when she stopped being stubborn.

464
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,502
She was so old at that point.

465
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,174
Had that lame hind limb.

466
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,345
Eyes always dripping from fly bites.

467
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:49,350
Levi used to do the
funniest imitation of her.

468
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,688
But she obeyed

469
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:59,526
and worked all day with no hesitation

470
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,947
and then limped back to the barn at night,

471
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,823
waiting in the dark, not moving

472
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:08,202
until the beating and the work
started again the next morning.

473
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,666
Did that until she was all used up

474
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,543
and there was nothing
left to do but shoot her.

475
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:31,016
This world offers too much.

476
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,562
And contrary to what you think,

477
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:40,734
I'm too smart to let
myself turn out that way.

478
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:47,741
And if that means sinning to get what I want,

479
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,412
well, then, so be it.

480
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:59,336
I won't be shamed by the likes of you
or anyone else anymore.

481
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,674
What I've done,

482
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,761
what I will do,

483
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:13,100
is nowhere near the deceitful life
you've obviously led.

484
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,357
God has turned a deaf ear to you, I'm afraid.

485
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:32,244
Eternal damnation is the
fate of Pastor Elkins.

486
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,500
But before you go to the flames,

487
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:43,797
I think it's only fair to confess
the rest of my sins to you.

488
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,053
See, what I confessed in church that night,

489
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:52,639
that night you beat me like that mule,

490
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,641
isn't the whole story.

491
00:39:56,269 --> 00:40:00,564
The man I mentioned
I had a relationship with,

492
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,692
he's the chief of surgery here.

493
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:06,320
Dr. Thackery. You met him.

494
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:12,659
You shook the very fingers
I begged him to slip inside me so many times.

495
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,789
He's older than you.

496
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,627
And he was a terrible cocaine user.

497
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,255
I used to get him his drugs,

498
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,635
and in return he would dip
his erect penis in those drugs

499
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,930
and let me feel just how good it was.

500
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:42,481
After that, I would do anything for him
as long as he would fuck me.

501
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:51,115
But that, dear Father,

502
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,201
is not the end of my story.

503
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,704
I sunk lower.

504
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:02,251
Maybe in all your experience
with the brothels

505
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:05,254
you've heard of something
called the Golden Lotus.

506
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,092
While he was having sex,

507
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:15,722
I stuck my foot in the mouth of an Oriental
and let him suck on it as he ejaculated.

508
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:21,770
And he paid me $100 for the pleasure.

509
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,357
More than once.

510
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:32,531
I just wanted you to know everything
before you went.

511
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,537
Bye, Daddy.

512
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,249
Enjoy your trip.

513
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,514
Dad?

514
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,233
Dad?

515
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,318
Are you here?

516
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:59,409
Hey, there.
I didn't expect to see you here.

517
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:02,329
Come on up. The view is wonderful.

518
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,759
That's a long walk.

519
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,096
There'll be an elevator soon.

520
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,555
Where's Henry?

521
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,974
He'll be here any moment.

522
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:25,519
Good. What do you think?

523
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,480
Hmm?

524
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,233
Cold rooms.

525
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,112
Light therapy patio up on the roof.

526
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,699
Gonna be a marvel.

527
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,288
This is it.

528
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:48,375
This is my legacy.

529
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:55,215
Long after I'm gone,
this is what people will remember me for.

530
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:01,054
I'm not certain it's all
you'll be remembered for.

531
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:06,977
Well, there'll be the shipping
and other endeavors, but this,

532
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:11,064
this is going to save lives every day.

533
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:18,447
Then why would you be so greedy and foolish
as to risk and hurt so many people?

534
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,784
What do you mean?

535
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:25,329
I know about it, Dad.

536
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:30,334
I know about the inspectors
and the bribes and the ports.

537
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:31,835
I know about it all.

538
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,171
Cornelia, you're jabbering.
What are you talking...

539
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:37,007
Inspector Bradley and
the Immigration Office at the docks.

540
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:39,885
You've been bribing him and his men.

541
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,056
Inspector Brad...

542
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,683
Oh, Neely, there isn't a shipping man

543
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:49,478
in New York who doesn't go out
and slip those fellas

544
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:53,607
a 20 every now and again to get
a little happy in a pub.

545
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,985
But that is hardly a crime.

546
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:02,282
If only that was your crime, but it's not.
I know it and Henry knows it.

547
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:06,286
You move up the sick and the poor
to second-class,

548
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:09,039
and the inspectors let them into the country

549
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,000
where they infest the tenements
and the neighborhoods.

550
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:15,212
People died, Dad. Lots of them.

551
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:19,466
In San Francisco and Hawaii.
Here in New York.

552
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,010
Speight found out and you killed him, too.

553
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:23,553
What?

554
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:29,976
What in the hell are you accusing me of?

555
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:31,895
Don't make it worse by denying it.

556
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,230
Neely, this is ridiculous.

557
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:35,565
Don't touch me.

558
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,489
I assure you

559
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:48,370
I did none of the things that you say.

560
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:53,875
Look around you. Take a good look around!

561
00:45:56,379 --> 00:46:00,340
If I was so concerned about money

562
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:04,344
would I be working so hard
to give it away to the Knick?

563
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:07,139
- I know your business is in trouble.
- What?

564
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:10,308
- You owe Hobart an enormous amount.
- Neely!

565
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,771
In a way.

566
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,860
But that is just an investment
that he made in me.

567
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:21,695
I am on the rebound.

568
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,698
Yet you still can't cover
your commitments to the Knick.

569
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:31,329
I did not do what you think.

570
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:35,709
We're going to the police, Henry and I.

571
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,544
It's already decided.

572
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:40,964
Neely, this is preposterous.

573
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:47,179
Do you smell that?

574
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,014
What?

575
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:54,561
Oh, my God. We've got to get out of here.

576
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,360
Oh, God.

577
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:08,074
Look, over there.

578
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,957
It's a 20-foot drop.

579
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,754
Help me with this.

580
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,805
I'm gonna lower this ladder down in the hole.

581
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,476
Oh, wait. You've got to go sideways.

582
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,394
Here, go up. Go up.

583
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:39,606
I got it.

584
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,693
- All right, here.
- It's not long enough.

585
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,946
It'll carry you most of the way, maybe more.

586
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,822
You can climb down, hang, and drop.

587
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,866
- I'll hold it from up here.
- No.

588
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:52,035
You have to, Neely. There's no other way.

589
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,620
- And what about you?
- Go find help.

590
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:57,082
There's a fire brigade two blocks down.
They've probably already seen the smoke.

591
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,042
I'll go up the stairs and
wait it out up there.

592
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,377
- Now, go. You've got to go.
- I won't.

593
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:05,131
Neely, you're running out of time!
Go! Get on this ladder and go now.

594
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:10,387
That's it. Climb down as far as you can.

595
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:13,723
Oh, God.

596
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:16,017
That's it, Neely. Go.

597
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,144
As far as you can go.

598
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:22,148
That's it.

599
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,819
Good, now let go.

600
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,154
Now, Neely. Now!

601
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:37,038
Neely? Neely?

602
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:39,332
Neely, are you all right?

603
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,377
Go get help.

604
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,838
Go.

605
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,631
Now.

606
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,205
Where?

607
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,002
Dad!

608
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,803
No! No!

609
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:14,761
Oh, God.

610
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,022
Oh, God.

611
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,279
We're almost there.

612
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,907
We should talk
about compensation.

613
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:39,452
No, I'm not much
interested in money.

614
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:46,126
You know,
I fund a hospital in New York.

615
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,336
The Knickerbocker.

616
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:51,131
Isn't that where J.M. Christiansen is?

617
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,634
I hear he's doing some astonishing work.

618
00:50:57,138 --> 00:51:00,557
You two should meet. I'll introduce you.
