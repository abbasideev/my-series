2
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:09,384
Keep your eyes steadily on the disc.

3
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,095
But it's getting harder.

4
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:15,848
Your eyes are so tired from staring.

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:19,936
Your eyelids feel like lead.

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,647
They want to close.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,109
Heavier. Heavier.

8
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:29,737
You must close them

9
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,614
now.

10
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,953
Ladies and gentlemen,

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,373
these three people are now
in a state of hypnosis.

12
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,876
Suggestions I make will
be implicitly accepted

13
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,212
regardless of their nonsensical character.

14
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,805
Archie.

15
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,809
Archie, when you wake,

16
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,396
there will be a kitten in front of you.

17
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:07,650
There is nothing more
frightening in this world than this creature.

18
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,111
You want nothing to do with it.

19
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,869
No!

20
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,829
No, get... No kitties!

21
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,914
It's only a kitten.

22
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,332
Get the cat out of here!

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,002
Gonna kill us all! Get it out!

24
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,179
They come from Siberia,

25
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,390
a fierce and dangerous place.

26
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:41,476
Their mother, when she was with child,

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,020
was attacked by a bear.

28
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,272
The girls, even in their mother's womb,

29
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:50,151
instinctively knew that to survive
they should cling to one another.

30
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,528
They held on so tight,

31
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,615
and this was the result.

32
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,950
The birth was so excruciating,

33
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,077
it killed their mother.

34
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:03,539
Their father died of shock upon seeing them.

35
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:07,168
Zoya and Nika were alone.

36
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,295
But they proved in the womb

37
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,006
their incredible survival ability.

38
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,550
They lived off the milk of a goat

39
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,094
and fallen acorns from a tree.

40
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:21,557
They watched the wolves
and by the age of four could hunt.

41
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:25,269
They taught themselves to speak, to sing,

42
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:29,649
and even to play instruments
that they carved themselves.

43
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,881
That's quite a story.

44
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,883
I've recounted it 1,000 times

45
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,010
and I still find it inspiring.

46
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,556
How would you know
that they clung to each other in the womb?

47
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,307
You telling me my business, mister?

48
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:07,353
No, no, no. I meant no disrespect.
I'm a doctor. I'm a natural skeptic.

49
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,022
John Thackery. Knickerbocker Hospital.

50
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,691
Lester Brockhurst.

51
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:15,945
Mr. Brockhurst, would you be willing
to allow me to examine the girls?

52
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,113
What for?

53
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,491
Purely from a scientific perspective.

54
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,577
When was the last time they saw a doctor?

55
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,079
I got a physician's book.
I make sure they're healthy.

56
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,708
No, of course.
And it looks like you're doing a fine job.

57
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,419
One of them got dysentery last year.
I fixed her up.

58
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,504
That's very impressive.

59
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,924
So they don't share a digestive tract.

60
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,845
It's not that I don't trust doctors,

61
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,556
it's the time it takes.
That's money out of my pocket.

62
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,478
So, what would you say
if I offered to hire them for a private show?

63
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,398
We'll need transportation

64
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,651
and a meal afterwards for me
at a reputable place.

65
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,280
That can definitely be arranged.

66
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,990
I'll be in touch.

67
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,359
Morphine for the pain.

68
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,656
The nurse will take you to another
room to rest for a couple of hours.

69
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,951
The X-rays will have been developed by then.

70
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,703
I'll come in and check on you
and take you home.

71
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,053
Do those help?

72
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,222
A little.

73
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:11,227
The key seems to be in coating
the zinc needles with mercury.

74
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,230
And the amount of current needed
for the zinc and mercury to ionize

75
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,148
is dependent upon the size of the tumor.

76
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,276
But if done correctly, the procedure claims
to kill all the malignant cells

77
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,778
without disturbing the healthy tissue.

78
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,656
It seems far less risky
than an all-out laryngectomy.

79
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,325
I witnessed several of those in Paris.
They all failed.

80
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,868
They couldn't reconstruct the windpipe

81
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,538
after having removed
so much tissue with the tumor.

82
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,542
I think it's worth trying.

83
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,170
In the absence of any other solution, yes.

84
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,673
But it's still experimental
and Zinberg would never...

85
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,510
I don't have the luxury
of two years' worth of study.

86
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,429
So I was hoping you'd help me.

87
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,016
You have experience working in secret.

88
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,436
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,272
I just meant I need someone I can trust.

90
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,692
Harold. Harold. Just tell Croker

91
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,737
he'll have the last 100,000 by Tuesday.

92
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,031
Right.

93
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,868
And listen, Harold.
Where are we with the Brooklyn lines?

94
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:12,747
'Cause I don't want to open the paper
and find they've all been auctioned off.

95
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,709
Uh-huh.

96
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,754
Right.

97
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,422
That's fine.

98
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,341
Just keep me apprised of the situation.

99
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,802
All right, I have to go, Prettyman.

100
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,387
Goodbye.

101
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,892
Nurse Elkins.

102
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,643
What are you...

103
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,440
I've been watching some of the other girls

104
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,651
receive invitations
to the fundraising ball from their suitors.

105
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,406
I was wondering when I was gonna get mine.

106
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,830
How many other girls do I have to watch smile

107
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,334
holding an invitation before I get one?

108
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,961
I...

109
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,841
Usually you have so many
clever things to say.

110
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,178
What's the matter?

111
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,598
People can see.

112
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,266
The glass.

113
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,186
Doesn't bother me. Does it bother you?

114
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,109
Maybe I should stop
so you can gather your thoughts.

115
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,610
No.

116
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,907
Well, then, my invitation?

117
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,077
Soon.

118
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,662
Very soon.

119
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,501
Good.

120
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,677
And this is the big top

121
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,763
at the center of our circus.

122
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,559
How full does your gallery get?

123
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,019
When Thackery was leading the operations,

124
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,564
standing room only.

125
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:05,526
Not what yours is, is it, Russell?

126
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:11,365
Well, we don't have the suction machine

127
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,951
or any of the other electric gadgets.

128
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,744
- Lighting is better in here, too.
- Mmm-hmm.

129
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,333
I'm sure yours will still suffice.

130
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,169
For what?

131
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,010
Carr needs surgery.

132
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,636
Umbilical hernia.

133
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:36,974
Had it for years,
but I need to have it taken care of.

134
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,268
I've read your hernia paper.

135
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,103
I thought I'd do it for him.

136
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,646
My procedure?

137
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,441
Russell says he's read the paper thoroughly.

138
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,818
But he's never performed it.

139
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,529
And you'd be doing this at your place?

140
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,072
Of course he would.

141
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,575
We couldn't do it here.

142
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,705
There are rules.

143
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,668
I was thinking,

144
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,796
and no disrespect to you, Russell,

145
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,340
but since I did invent the procedure,

146
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,967
perhaps I should be the one to perform it.

147
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,805
Of course.

148
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,641
You were the first choice.

149
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,022
We should do it here

150
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,524
if we can.

151
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,485
I'll ask Thackery.

152
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,737
See if he can square it with the board.

153
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,490
Then we'll wait to hear from you.

154
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,330
- Hello?
- We're in here.

155
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,292
Sorry I'm late.

156
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,044
It's quite all right. We waited to eat.

157
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,963
Good evening, Dr. Gallinger.

158
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,383
What are you doing here?

159
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,636
Your wife graciously
invited me to dinner.

160
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,515
Why would you invite
Dr. Cotton into our home?

161
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,351
To thank him for what he did for me.

162
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,894
For us.

163
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,188
He's the reason I feel the way I do.

164
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,608
I am very pleased with
how Eleanor's been doing.

165
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,110
I was just saying before you walked in,

166
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,487
I think she might be
mentally fit to have children again.

167
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,365
Isn't that wonderful, darling?

168
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,036
The hospital's been doing so well,

169
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,580
the state of New Jersey
has asked us to expand.

170
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,374
We've seen patients from across the country,

171
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,459
several from as far away as Europe.

172
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,629
Lucky for you that
preying on the desperate is so lucrative.

173
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:33,299
Everett, I will not have
you insult our guest.

174
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,883
That's all right, Eleanor.

175
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,719
A man's entitled to his opinion,

176
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,637
misinformed as it may be.

177
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,055
Misinformed?

178
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,517
You mutilated my wife.

179
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,396
And yet here you sit with your wife,

180
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,482
a wonderful host
who's prepared this delicious meal.

181
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,735
Six months ago, you dreamed
of an evening like this.

182
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,903
You think so? Then you're misinformed.

183
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,408
Excuse me.

184
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,077
Um, let me give you an example.

185
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,998
We had one young man, suffered terribly
his entire life from paranoia.

186
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,542
Distrust of others. He heard voices.

187
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,545
He was a hypochondriac
to the point where he couldn't function

188
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,797
due to his own preoccupation with himself.

189
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,509
Now, as with Eleanor,
I knew sepsis was the cause,

190
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,303
so I removed his teeth at once.

191
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,306
There was little change at first,

192
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,142
but I owed it to this young man to help.

193
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,061
And so I removed his tonsils
and his gallbladder.

194
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,772
Now the distrust disappeared.

195
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,608
So I kept on.

196
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,819
In the end, his spleen,
colon, and testicles, they all came out.

197
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,988
Dear God.

198
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,201
I realize it may seem extreme,

199
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:46,497
but I'm happy to report
the young man is now home,

200
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,917
he's found employment,
no longer struggles with his symptoms.

201
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,877
He is leading a relatively normal life.

202
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,046
And five years ago,
that would have been impossible.

203
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,839
Normal life?

204
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,675
That young man isn't
a hypochondriac anymore

205
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,845
'cause there's nothing left of him
to be hypochondriacal about.

206
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,098
I don't understand why a doctor

207
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,683
would shrink so timidly
from the frontiers of science.

208
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,894
Is that so?

209
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,229
Are you all right?

210
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,148
I'm not feeling well.

211
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,567
Where is your lavatory?

212
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:19,613
Please, it's just up the
stairs and to the left.

213
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,751
You really don't need to be so rude.

214
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,086
He's our guest.

215
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,130
Why did you invite him into our home?

216
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,925
- I could kill him.
- Perhaps you could just remove his teeth.

217
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,012
Without anesthetic.

218
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,515
I wanted him here.

219
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:50,894
And you will both please
try to remain civil throughout dessert.

220
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,648
I don't have an appetite.

221
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,672
I'm sorry, Mrs. Gallinger.

222
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,966
I am going to head on home.
I'm not feeling well.

223
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,094
I'm so sorry to hear that.

224
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,221
But I'm very glad that you came

225
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:30,267
so that I could show you my appreciation
for what you did for me.

226
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,810
Of course.

227
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,395
Good night.

228
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,333
Are you ready?

229
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,801
I'll do my best, Mother.

230
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,475
I love you, my darling.

231
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,686
I'll see you when you wake up.

232
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,746
Do you need a drape?

233
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,918
No, she's a patient. She needs a surgeon.

234
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,002
I'm a surgeon.

235
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,103
Thank you.

236
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,591
Right, hand me the electrodes.

237
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,261
Make sure and contact the zinc and mercury

238
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,096
that's been injected into the tumor

239
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,432
in order to ensure that
ionization is complete

240
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,976
and the cancer cells are killed.

241
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,438
You did a nice job with these.

242
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,276
When this is over, I'm gonna have these
melted down into a necklace for her

243
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,736
to cover the scar.

244
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,280
1,000 milliamperes.

245
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,251
Three, two, one.

246
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,565
All right.

247
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,444
Any change?

248
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,030
It should shrink and soften.

249
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,079
We'll have to go again.
Increase the milliamperes to 1,200.

250
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,414
What's going on?

251
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,584
It's all right. I'm a surgeon here.
Dr. Chickering.

252
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,837
There's no surgery scheduled for tonight
and no emergencies.

253
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,255
You're not supposed to be in here.

254
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,757
Yes, I am!

255
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:51,843
And what about him?

256
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,723
I'm harder to explain.

257
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,936
- Excuse me.
- It's all right. It's all right.

258
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,105
You're against the clock now.

259
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,775
What are you doing?

260
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,151
The laryngectomy.

261
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,862
The tumor is braided into her larynx,

262
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,782
trachea, and esophagus.
How do you expect to remove it?

263
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,283
What do you suggest, then?

264
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:20,288
Close her up and take a day
to consider your options.

265
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,124
Options?

266
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,127
We know what's gonna happen.
She starves to death or asphyxiates

267
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,962
or chokes on her own spit.

268
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:35,887
That part of the tumor may come away,

269
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,764
but it'll take too much
of the posterior mucosa.

270
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:40,434
I'll shave it as closely as I can,
try to limit the damage.

271
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,519
She's tumorous through and through.

272
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,855
God damn it,
there's no windpipe to work with.

273
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,481
It's all tumor. It's torn to bits.

274
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,525
Holes everywhere. Her lips are blue.

275
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,069
She's hypoxic.

276
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,321
Dr. Chickering,
what in God's name are you doing?

277
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,073
In God's name I'm trying to save my mother!

278
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,242
I take full responsibility.

279
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,453
And if you worked here,
that might be worth a damn.

280
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:03,123
There's no repairing that ventricle.
Just use the tissue to shore up that hole.

281
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,916
Her breathing is becoming labored.

282
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,209
What is Dr. Edwards doing here?

283
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,586
He knew the procedure we were trying.

284
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,045
Then why isn't he leading the surgery?

285
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,297
I've lost sight in my left eye.

286
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,716
It's only recently begun to improve a bit.

287
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,094
So your assisting surgeon is half blind

288
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,263
with no depth perception. Wonderful.

289
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,683
If you would kindly excoriate us later,
we are in trouble here.

290
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,189
Oh, my.

291
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,777
Harvest some tissue
from below the thyroid cartilage

292
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,446
and use that to patch the space
on the tracheal rings.

293
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,947
Can you see well enough to patch that space?

294
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,115
Yes.

295
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,702
Good. Now draw the tissue across.

296
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,039
Don't worry yourself
with the cancerous section.

297
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,500
You're just trying
to give her something to breathe through.

298
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,669
Now hold it up against the anterior wall.

299
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:50,962
I'll suture it.

300
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,717
I'm not clean, but the instrument is.

301
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,053
My patch is almost in.

302
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,515
- She's still not getting any air.
- It's falling apart.

303
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,767
It's shredding
the edge of the tumor near the subglottis.

304
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,060
We need more tissue.

305
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,896
She's cyanotic.

306
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,611
There's no pulse.

307
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,488
We can harvest from the soft palate

308
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,491
and use it to cover
the shredded area near the subglottis.

309
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,245
- Bertie.
- No.

310
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,540
Let her go.

311
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,333
She's been through enough.

312
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,086
Let her go.

313
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,890
Fuck.

314
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,269
You're right,
it could never have succeeded.

315
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,688
From the day she was diagnosed,
she was dead.

316
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:53,650
It needed to be studied,
it needed to be perfected.

317
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,735
But she was my mother.

318
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:57,946
What was I supposed to do?

319
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,449
I'm not running a circus.

320
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,076
There are no high-wire acts here.

321
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,828
But sometimes there needs to be.

322
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,872
Sometimes risks have to be taken.

323
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,291
Not in my operating rooms.

324
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,803
I think it best if I resign.

325
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,184
I agree.

326
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,982
It'll save me the task of having to fire you
for violating protocols.

327
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,405
Now go be with your family.

328
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,192
I'm sorry.

329
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,656
So am I.

330
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,915
I was stupid to think I could do it.

331
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,584
You must be furious with me.

332
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,879
You had the courage to try.

333
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,839
I couldn't even look.

334
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,720
Why's Vera leaving?

335
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,680
- I don't know.
- Pregnant.

336
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,141
- She have any place?
- No.

337
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,809
And the father?

338
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,228
Whaler she met at a saloon.

339
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,564
He's somewhere
in the Atlantic for all she knows.

340
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,775
They can't just throw her in the street.

341
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:26,112
I should try and get her in
on the ward at the Knick.

342
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:29,449
They'll certainly be eager to hear from you.

343
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,077
I thought I had baby
troubles just last month.

344
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:35,830
I told you girls
don't let the fella finish inside you.

345
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,875
I didn't. And Vera said neither did she.

346
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:43,338
But it ain't like the fella's gonna listen to
a lot of reason while he's in his state.

347
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,673
He's paying to finish where he wants.

348
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,428
You got another way to make a dollar?

349
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,847
Rose, you were a midwife. Tell Nettie.

350
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,851
A man pulling out is just
wishful thinking most times.

351
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:03,358
But there are other ways
to stop a man getting you pregnant.

352
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,943
What kind of other ways?

353
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,571
We can talk about this
another time.

354
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,539
Sleep is coming.

355
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,501
Sleep.

356
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,927
- Did it work?
- Appears so.

357
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,220
Very good.

358
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,890
What do you think?

359
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,101
You're Merlin the wizard.

360
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,978
I can't fathom how that works.

361
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,313
Neither can I.

362
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:46,317
Seems to reach a part of the brain
that isn't physical.

363
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,653
If one could suggest to someone
who was hypnotized

364
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,614
to do all sorts of humorous feats,

365
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,492
then why not
use it for something more practical?

366
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,120
Change people's perception.

367
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,748
- Curb their addiction.
- I've heard crazier ideas.

368
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,042
In this room, actually.

369
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,795
What habits does your subject have?

370
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,427
Simple, direct instructions.

371
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,437
Mr. Cleary.

372
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,440
When I blow on you,

373
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,109
you will wake and you will no longer

374
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,486
be interested in smoking your pipe.

375
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,282
You will detest it.

376
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,953
The sight of it will anger you.

377
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,590
The fuck is that?

378
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,717
- It's your pipe.
- No. No.

379
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,135
- That ain't mine.
- Yes, it is.

380
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,179
- No.
- Do you want it?

381
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,891
You bet your ass I do.

382
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,227
I'm sorry, Doc, but all that hocus-pocus...

383
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:05,480
Yeah, thanks for wasting our time.
Go on, get out.

384
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,819
I wanted to present something to you.

385
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,656
Are you familiar with Garrison Carr?

386
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,074
No.

387
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,201
He's a bit of an established thinker
in certain communities.

388
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,120
He's in need of a hernia repair
and I'd like to perform it.

389
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,081
Which communities?

390
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,958
Little Africa.

391
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,918
Harlem.

392
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:30,964
Perhaps if the request to the board
came from you.

393
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,093
I can try.

394
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,137
It'll be good if there's a doctor in the room

395
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:43,559
so I can revive them once they discover
your proposed patient is a Negro.

396
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,948
Bertie the departed.

397
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,741
I want to come back.

398
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,911
What about Zinberg?

399
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:03,204
He's extraordinary

400
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,540
and what he's doing over there
would impress you.

401
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,669
Turns out I'm a bit too reckless for him.

402
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,966
I saw the notice in the paper
about your mother. I'm sorry.

403
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,513
I need the speed of this place.

404
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,099
Of you.

405
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:25,977
Maybe I've changed.

406
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,732
Perhaps I'm not as reckless
and fast as you remember.

407
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:35,862
Algernon told me that last month you
performed surgery with a telephone.

408
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,743
Some things have changed, I promise you.

409
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,204
They have with me, too,
or else I wouldn't be here.

410
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,958
I know now that this is where I belong.

411
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,087
I've always known that.

412
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,182
What's he saying?

413
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,017
He doesn't like you being here.

414
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:09,771
I'm just trying to help him
and get some information.

415
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,564
How long has he been like this?

416
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,743
Has he seen anyone
from the health department?

417
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:33,544
- He's afraid you're trying to deport him.
- Assure him I'm not.

418
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,886
He's saying that the guy from the health
department threatened to.

419
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,971
Was his name Speight?

420
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,765
Do you know? Speight?

421
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:52,397
He's saying he was a pig.

422
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,982
- Fat like a barrel.
- Speight.

423
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:59,779
Did you give this to Inspector Speight?

424
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,584
This belonged to his brother Aldo.

425
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,420
May I speak to him?

426
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,422
Aldo died, signorina.

427
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,341
Did he have the same symptoms?

428
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,440
Yes, same symptoms.

429
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:38,151
Fingers turned black, blood everywhere.

430
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:42,113
He's saying that he came down the ship
feeling no well and in a week he died.

431
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:47,034
Did your brother have money?
Was he well-off?

432
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,496
No.

433
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:54,208
Then how could he afford
a second-class ticket?

434
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,639
He doesn't know.

435
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,475
He doesn't know, but look,

436
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,560
maybe Aldo stole it.

437
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,104
But Gino came here honestly.
He's a good man.

438
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:17,815
He has a family, a job, you know?
He didn't do no wrong.

439
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,405
You must leave, I'm sorry.

440
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,241
- He needs to see a doctor.
- He wants you to leave. I'm sorry.

441
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,868
Of course. I'm sorry.

442
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,264
After the swelling goes down, try to...

443
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,600
Keep it elevated and then you can go home.

444
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,352
Excuse me one moment.

445
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,858
Lucy.

446
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:06,447
I'm sorry.
I'm sure that must have been a surprise.

447
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,282
A pleasant one.

448
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,785
Welcome back.

449
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,746
I know I felt more than you at one point,

450
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,581
but I won't pretend my treatment towards you

451
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:18,167
after our falling out
wasn't intended to hurt you.

452
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:19,710
It did.

453
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,337
Well, I was angry.

454
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:25,049
And I acted like a child.

455
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,802
And I'm sorry.

456
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,181
I didn't expect you to forgive me.

457
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:34,183
Well, I have.

458
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:35,893
I've learned a lot about forgiveness.

459
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:38,896
And though I don't expect it,
I hope you'll give me yours.

460
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,148
Of course.

461
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,485
I'd give anything to be friends again.

462
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,196
Me, too.

463
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,407
There's a ball coming up.

464
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,159
Excuse me?

465
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,120
To raise money for the new hospital.

466
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,040
I heard you have a new lady friend.

467
00:31:58,667 --> 00:31:59,667
Oh.

468
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,921
I just thought that if you wanted to attend,
it would only be fair to her...

469
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:05,965
I don't know her name.

470
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,258
Genevieve.

471
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,386
To give her ample warning
so that she has time

472
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,096
to get a dress and prepare.

473
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,016
Thank you.

474
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,184
Are you going?

475
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:19,937
We'll see.

476
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,862
Algie's gonna have Thackery ask the board

477
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:32,658
if he can perform a surgery
on that D.W. Garrison Carr fellow.

478
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,537
That Carr's in our boy's ear.

479
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:40,583
Algie's got my vote, but he's pushing harder

480
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,877
than the rest of the board can stand.

481
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,130
Carr does more harm than good.

482
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,382
Good afternoon.

483
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,968
Let me have a Glenlivet.

484
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:52,553
- Two, please.
- Yes, sir.

485
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,388
It's too soon.

486
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,559
Barrow said he's received inquiries
from nervous donors

487
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,728
about Algie's involvement going forward.

488
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,356
It's just one surgery.

489
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,816
And Algie invented it, for God's sake.

490
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,861
I'm not quibbling about our boy's skill.

491
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,280
I would take him over Thackery these days.

492
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:13,866
But our donors believe Thack is a god

493
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,869
and we need them to continue believing that.

494
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,669
It's not just...

495
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,796
It's not just their estimation

496
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,173
of Thackery that matters.

497
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,927
They clearly don't want
the new Knick integrated.

498
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,680
Meaning having a Negro doctor
or his Negro patients?

499
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,515
Both.

500
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:40,601
If we want Algie to move uptown with us,

501
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,436
we have to sacrifice something.

502
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,733
So the patients.

503
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,043
So the barge takes all the
lower-class passengers

504
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,379
over to Ellis Island for the full inspection,

505
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,132
but a doc gives them a quick once-over here.

506
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,050
What happens if they get marked?

507
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,386
Well, then they got to see
another doctor on Ellis

508
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,762
for a more thorough exam.

509
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,556
If the doc thinks they're too sick

510
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,057
and can't get cured easy here,

511
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,642
then they can't come into the country.

512
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,936
Over 25,000 last year alone.

513
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:25,604
Where did they all go?

514
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:28,774
Back to where they came from.

515
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,026
What would send them back?

516
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,362
Anything highly contagious.

517
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:35,740
Trachoma, typhus, cholera...

518
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,575
- Plague?
- Yeah.

519
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,828
And they'd have
to go back to their country of origin?

520
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,288
Not with embarkation.

521
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,707
See, the shipping companies
have to pay a $100 fine

522
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,417
for each and passage back,

523
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:50,296
so most of the big companies
do their own health inspections

524
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,757
before the immigrants
even leave their home ports.

525
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:55,760
The thing is, over there,
people always get through.

526
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,095
We don't miss them on this end.

527
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,141
Is it this crowded every day?

528
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,435
Yeah, and it's getting worse, too.

529
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,855
And this is just the third-class
and the steerage passengers.

530
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,316
What about the first
and second-class passengers?

531
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,109
They get off down there.

532
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:14,153
Immigration officials
have already met the boats

533
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,197
in the harbor and checked them out
right on the ship.

534
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,741
There's very little
risk of something really infectious

535
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,368
coming from the ones
that can pay to ride in comfort.

536
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,458
Dr. Thackery.

537
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:31,670
Someone, or maybe someones,

538
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:35,007
are here to see you.
They're waiting in your office.

539
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,094
Excuse me.

540
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,312
Mr. Brockhurst.

541
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,564
Cab ride here was a dollar.

542
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:58,489
The one on their right is Zoya
and the one on the left is Nika.

543
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,574
- Say hello, girls.
- Hello.

544
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,785
- Nika.
- Hello.

545
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,495
She's the dumb one.

546
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,164
Excellent.

547
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:08,749
Well, let's get started.

548
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,209
If you'd like to come with me, please.

549
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,919
Whoa, whoa. Where are you taking them?

550
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,004
The X-ray room.

551
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:17,466
I want to see what bones
and organs they might share.

552
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,593
If you want them to take their clothes off,

553
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,680
that'll cost more
if that's what you want them for.

554
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,850
No, that is not what I want them for.

555
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,268
Many men do.

556
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:30,104
Not a one ever said it
wasn't worth the money.

557
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,650
If you want to wait in the lobby,
I'll be about an hour.

558
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,241
If you'll just follow me.

559
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,118
All the modern gadgets.

560
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,787
Electric toaster, gas stove.

561
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:50,666
They're even installing a dumbwaiter
all the way from the service entrance

562
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,002
for ice and food deliveries.

563
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,129
I could learn to cook for you, Hermie.

564
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,798
Ah, we'll hire someone for that.

565
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,884
Cook you anything you want.

566
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,219
When can we move in?

567
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:04,597
Mmm. About a month or so.

568
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:09,393
Every project in New York is being slowed
because of the demand for workers.

569
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:13,731
I'll need the time
to gather the rest of the funds

570
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,232
to pay for your freedom.

571
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:20,696
I don't want you spending a minute longer
than you need to at Ping Wu's.

572
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,452
So, can you see us here?

573
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:27,870
It's beautiful.

574
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:38,047
It would have been nice
to be able to see the park.

575
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:41,216
Well, those apartments
are a bit more expensive.

576
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:42,927
Oh.

577
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,847
It's just with all of my expenses,

578
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,807
we still have to buy furniture.

579
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:51,060
I understand, Hermie.

580
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,021
You're doing the best you can, I suppose.

581
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,370
Just imagine if we were higher up.

582
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,332
What it would be like
to look out the window when we fuck.

583
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,336
I'd bend over...

584
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:21,298
And you'd pull up my skirt.

585
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:26,679
Pull out your hard dick.

586
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,807
Feel for my wet coo.

587
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:39,066
And look out onto the entire park
as you slip it into me.

588
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,657
King Hermie and his big baddie.

589
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,547
I want her for another hour.

590
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,061
So these are both your ribs.

591
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:17,896
And your hearts would be inside.

592
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,483
This is the band of muscles
that connect the two of you.

593
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,736
And this is your liver.

594
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,115
You only have one for the two of you.

595
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,123
Now, if that's the only organ you share,

596
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,418
I believe it might be
possible to separate you.

597
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,632
- Separate?
- If that is something you would want.

598
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,177
I'd need a lot more information
in order to do it.

599
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:52,014
More examinations. More about your past.

600
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,350
Not the story he makes you tell.

601
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:56,727
The truth.

602
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,983
How did you come to meet Mr. Brockhurst?

603
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:07,905
We were living in forest in Siberia.

604
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:10,157
He was an explorer.

605
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,701
You're not onstage.

606
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,996
It's just us.

607
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,795
Where are you from originally?

608
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,632
We were both born in Minsk.

609
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,761
Well, if only one of you were born in Minsk,

610
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,137
that would be a miracle.

611
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,601
Our father didn't want us

612
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:41,105
and sold us to circus when we were babies.

613
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:44,024
We went from one to the next.

614
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:48,821
Prague, Bologna, Marseilles,

615
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:53,283
then Blackpool where Mr. Brockhurst
bought and bring us here.

616
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:56,662
How does he treat you?

617
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,040
Better than some.

618
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,836
Have you ever been to school?

619
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:05,504
Can you read?

620
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,297
I know some letters and numbers.

621
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,550
How about you, Nika?

622
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,386
Nika is shy.

623
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,139
She's smart, though.

624
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,640
More than me.

625
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:21,562
What does Mr. Brockhurst say
about working for him?

626
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:28,068
We are his property.

627
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:34,449
He tell us that no one else protect us.

628
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,952
If we left him, where would we go?

629
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:41,748
In this country they would
throw us in cage and let us die.

630
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,086
So he protect us.

631
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,131
We do what he says.

632
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,094
And what about these men
that he was talking about?

633
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,602
I'm not gonna think anything bad of you.

634
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,437
I just want to help.

635
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,902
Sometimes...

636
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:16,241
Men want us to be naked with them.

637
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,622
Watch us kiss each other.

638
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,124
Touch each other.

639
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,336
Be with them.

640
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,797
Jesus.

641
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,886
Not like the story
Mr. Brockhurst tell, is it?

642
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,140
No, Nika.

643
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:42,976
Not even close.

644
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:52,778
What took so long?

645
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:55,614
It took me a little while
to get what I wanted.

646
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,574
- Did you?
- I did.

647
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:59,868
- But I need to see them again.
- Why?

648
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,913
Because as I was telling them,

649
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,749
I believe it might be
possible to separate them.

650
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,709
What, split them apart?

651
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:09,503
For good? Why the fuck would I want that?

652
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,381
No one's gonna pay
to see two girls who used to be connected.

653
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,425
No, but they'd be able to live a normal life.

654
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,262
I don't give a good goddamn.
Them girls make me money that way.

655
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,180
Lots of it.
And you're not gonna monkey with that.

656
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,266
I think they should decide for themselves.

657
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,601
Who the fuck do you think
you're dealing with? They're mine.

658
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,478
I got documents saying
I'm their legal guardian

659
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,814
just like if I was their daddy.
Now where's that money you owe?

660
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,607
Their time and my meal.

661
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,757
- You fuckin' parasite.
- Who the hell are you?

662
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:41,303
Stay down, stay down, stay down.

663
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,222
- Stay down.
- Everything's fine. You're safe.

664
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,016
Come with me.

665
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,684
Quiet.

666
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:49,269
All right.

667
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,358
Sorry about that.

668
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:59,863
So tomorrow I'll be by
to talk to you about some things.

669
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,698
Medical things.

670
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:04,451
But for now, I want you to rest up.

671
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,620
You're safe here.

672
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:10,165
Mr. Cleary will be with you
as long as you want.

673
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:13,293
And he'll be just outside
the door while you sleep.

674
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,963
I'll see you in the morning.

675
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:23,720
Don't worry.
I ain't gonna let nothing happen to you girls.

676
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,515
- Do you mind?
- No.

677
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,642
So, uh,

678
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:30,852
don't peg me as rude or nothing,

679
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:33,814
but you two got me asking all kinds
of questions in my head.

680
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,107
Like for instance,

681
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,443
how do you two take a shite?

682
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:41,363
Is it together like or does it all just go
through one of you?

683
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,955
Now, I'm going to place a clamp
on the hepatoduodenal ligament.

684
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,725
Normally, when you cut into the liver,

685
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:14,271
the hemorrhaging would
be enormous, but watch.

686
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,115
There's virtually no blood loss.

687
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,575
And our patient?

688
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:33,290
Pulse is steady.

689
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,208
This is the key to the separation.

690
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,879
We enter here at the bottom
where they're joined,

691
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:41,590
get access to the ligament and clamp it off.

692
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:45,802
The delicate work will be
to split the liver in half,

693
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:48,054
giving equal amount to each girl

694
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:51,224
so that it can regenerate
evenly in both of them.

695
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,143
We should also be concerned
about not damaging

696
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,312
the peritoneum around the intestines.

697
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:58,356
I'm more concerned about that Brockhurst
fellow showing up again.

698
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:00,150
Oh. I've taken care of that.

699
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:06,573
Harry.

700
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:10,702
You two waiting for the rest
of your ball team to show up?

701
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,829
Just looking out
for a scum sucker.

702
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:14,498
What brings you around here?

703
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:17,667
I was going to see
if I could get a bed for a girl in trouble.

704
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:19,836
Not so sure if I should go in, though.

705
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,338
You want I should ask for you?

706
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,006
Appreciate it.

707
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,550
Though you might want
to leave my name out of it.

708
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:28,678
You're looking a bit pale.

709
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,263
Are you sick?

710
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,057
Not eating much.

711
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,518
Let's buy you some lunch.

712
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,853
Pounce can watch
the door by himself for a bit.

713
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:39,022
If you bring me back a sausage.

714
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,233
If you got some money.

715
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:48,448
Thanks.

716
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,710
You ain't gonna find a better
beef and Guinness pie around.

717
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,755
Close your eyes
and you'll think you're in Dublin.

718
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,425
What's the matter?

719
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,885
Nothing.

720
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:12,222
I paid 10 cents for that.

721
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:14,015
You've got to eat something.

722
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:16,810
Get that color back in your cheeks.

723
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:24,901
What is it?

724
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,696
I'm fine. Just go about your food.

725
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,197
Christ, Harry.

726
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:30,490
I don't want your pity.

727
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:33,535
Then I won't give it to
you, but for fuck's sake,

728
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,204
it's all right to let me of all people
see you hurting.

729
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,584
Why you?
What makes you think you're so special?

730
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:44,546
I'm the only one who never thought you
was rock-hard from the start.

731
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,464
I knew you were soft under that habit.

732
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:49,593
Human. Or you gonna deny that, too?

733
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:51,720
I never said I wasn't human.

734
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:54,055
Yeah, well, no human deserves

735
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,933
to take the beating
you've been taking these last few months.

736
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:59,019
I think all the time, you know,

737
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,813
if it's killing me, what's it doing to her?

738
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,649
It's breaking me, that's what.

739
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,028
I've got less than nothing.

740
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,823
I'm useless. No good to anyone.

741
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,117
No job, no calling.

742
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,493
No purpose.

743
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,747
It ain't easy

744
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:21,875
losing what you lost.

745
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,628
Defrocked.

746
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,004
Unmasked.

747
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:30,258
I got nowhere to turn, no one who cares.

748
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,845
I can't even stand up to the sisters anymore.

749
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,805
I'm scared as all the rest of them.

750
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:39,392
With no job, they're going to kick me out.

751
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:41,186
I'm bound for the street.

752
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,147
Those fucking goats.

753
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,191
It's a charity home. They can't do that.

754
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,569
They can if they're charging me for a bed
and I got no way to pay.

755
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:52,238
What about the $3 I've been sending you
every week?

756
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:56,201
What $3?

757
00:49:58,704 --> 00:49:59,913
You ain't been getting it?

758
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,749
Those holy fucking sisters.

759
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,335
They've been flogging
you day and night for what you done

760
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,544
and then they steal your money.

761
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:08,088
Bunch of wicked cunts!

762
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,840
It makes no difference.

763
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:13,718
Your handouts or theirs,
I'm still a charity case.

764
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:15,011
I don't know what I'm going to do.

765
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:16,763
This is what you're going to do.

766
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:20,100
You're going to leave that place
and you're going to live with me.

767
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,226
That ain't a fucking invitation.

768
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,687
I told you I had the lady down the hall
make a curtain.

769
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,480
So you make up whatever rules you like

770
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,649
and I'll follow them to the T.

771
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:28,942
But you're coming with me.

772
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:30,777
And that's that.

773
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,031
Think I could get a whiskey?

774
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:36,991
Have mine.

775
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:40,203
Wicked fucking cunts.

776
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,821
Would you like me to heat up
last night's roast for you?

777
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,948
No.

778
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,746
Thank you

779
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,832
for taking care of so much
these past few days.

780
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,545
I'm happy to help.

781
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:38,553
You brighten my spirits.

782
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:45,059
Well, I think I may
be able to brighten them a bit more.

783
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:48,980
You don't know it yet,

784
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,276
but Saturday is going to be a red-letter day

785
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,030
in the life of Dr. Bertram Chickering Jr.

786
00:51:58,199 --> 00:51:59,657
- Oh?
- Mmm.

787
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:04,704
Um...

788
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,874
Is it some kind of a holiday?

789
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,461
Yeah, you could call it that.

790
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,213
Uh...

791
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:16,466
Cecily is visiting her brother at Harvard

792
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,718
and won't be back until Sunday,

793
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:23,348
so that means we have my apartment
all to ourselves.

794
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:36,027
Is that for the ball?

795
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:40,573
Yes.

796
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:44,452
Once this procedure is done,

797
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:47,163
no one will stare at them like freaks,

798
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:49,332
like they're monsters.

799
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,752
Can you imagine how they'll feel
when they're finally normal?

800
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:55,964
No...

801
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:58,132
I can't.

802
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:00,760
Oh, that's not what I meant.

803
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:03,388
- I'm sorry. I just get excited.
- Stop it, John.

804
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,599
I am what I am and I can live with that.

805
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,561
But I can't live like this.

806
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:11,604
I don't understand.

807
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,523
I can't live with you here, John.

808
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,404
You arrived one night and you were back.

809
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,325
You needed me and I wanted that.

810
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,706
So I wait for your knock on my door.

811
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,792
No matter what the hour, I wait here,

812
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:36,212
hoping you'll come.

813
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:40,884
Even though I know
you've just been with some other woman.

814
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,218
Abby.

815
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:45,138
And you have every right.
I have no claim on you.

816
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:50,393
What could a woman like me
rightly expect from any man?

817
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:55,481
But it's too hard now...

818
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,569
Knowing we'll never be together.

819
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:06,409
I can't fool myself any longer and it's...

820
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,494
Being near you is just too painful.

821
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,332
- Abby, I love you.
- Oh.

822
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,083
I never stopped.

823
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:15,627
You only come here to talk.

824
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:18,713
You go elsewhere for everything else.

825
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:20,548
Please just leave.

826
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:23,009
Abby.

827
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,761
I need you to go.

828
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,850
No.
