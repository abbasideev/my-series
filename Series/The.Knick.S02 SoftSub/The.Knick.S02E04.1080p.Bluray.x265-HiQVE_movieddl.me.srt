2
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,854
This is it.

3
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:24,982
It's not a bad size.

4
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,612
It's a palace for a colored man in this city.

5
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,782
I think you'll find it comfortable.

6
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,368
You didn't even tell your own mother?

7
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,459
I didn't tell anyone.

8
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,753
So, I'm a secret, then?

9
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,464
This must be very inconvenient for you.

10
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,716
It's a wonderful surprise.

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,467
You seem overjoyed.

12
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,184
- Who is she, Algernon?
- Excuse me?

13
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:06,691
A man...

14
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:15,658
A man stops writing to his woman
for two reasons.

15
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:22,999
Either he's dead.

16
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,839
Or he's moved on.

17
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,514
You look very much alive to me.

18
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,812
So?

19
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,026
I did meet someone.

20
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,447
Of course you did. I can almost picture her.

21
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,074
But it was no meaningless affair.

22
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,704
She became pregnant.

23
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,796
And where are they now,
your girl and your baby?

24
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,798
She terminated the pregnancy.

25
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,926
She married someone else.

26
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,096
And you still love her.

27
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,642
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,688
I should have written you these things
so that you knew to move on.

29
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,650
Could have saved you the time
and the expense of coming here.

30
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:35,154
I will pay for all of it,
your return and any divorce fees.

31
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:41,410
Did you really think
you could run me off so easily?

32
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,957
I have never let anyone tell me
when it's time to walk away,

33
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,084
and you are no exception.

34
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,379
I'm staying.

35
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,424
And I'm keeping what's mine.

36
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:03,182
I assume you only have one bed
in your palace?

37
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,231
Don't expect to experience
any wonderful surprises any time soon.

38
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,367
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

39
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,787
Let's kiss some more.

40
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,039
Kissing was fun.

41
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, we will, we will. I promise.

42
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,086
But this will be fun as well, I promise.

43
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,796
Okay.

44
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,300
What is that thing, anyway?

45
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:42,179
This is a little bit of magic in a box.

46
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,642
Now, if you wouldn't mind standing, please.

47
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:59,655
And if you wouldn't mind
removing your clothes, please.

48
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,115
What?

49
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,075
Henry!

50
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,702
Oh, it's just in good fun.

51
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,621
So I'll have you with me always.

52
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,832
Go on, Daisy. I dare you.

53
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,711
That's it.

54
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,297
That's great.

55
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,396
Yes!

56
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,857
Good girl.

57
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,408
So, once the pig's temperature
reached 107 Fahrenheit,

58
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:48,454
it killed off all the spirochete,
every last one in her system.

59
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:53,459
I then gave her a large injection of quinine,
and very soon the malaria fever broke.

60
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,752
She survived?

61
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,213
Happily rolling around
in her pen when I left.

62
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,217
But, John, that's a pig.

63
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,718
How could you be certain it'll work on me?

64
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,973
No, syphilis has the same characteristics
no matter who or what it lives in.

65
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,643
So, you want to cook me?

66
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,687
Essentially.

67
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:18,025
I mean, a pig's normal temperature is 102.
Ours is 98.

68
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,237
You know, raising her five degrees
was somewhat easier.

69
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,948
I'd have to raise you close to nine.

70
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,496
John, how can you be certain
that won't kill me in the process?

71
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,250
No, it's a risk, I know,
but I'll be with you the whole time

72
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,128
and I'll be ready to inject you
if the fever starts to take you.

73
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,631
I don't know.

74
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,341
Abby.

75
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,844
Abby, this is a chance to cure you.

76
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,556
You know, it would give you your life back.

77
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,643
But can you be sure
it won't take my life instead?

78
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,648
No.

79
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,276
I can't.

80
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,989
My father tended
to Secretary of State Seward

81
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,615
on the night Lincoln was shot.

82
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,994
Did you know he was attacked, too?

83
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,203
I didn't.

84
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,456
Stabbed by a rogue Confederate.

85
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:21,630
Old Dad was doing exactly
what I'm attempting right now.

86
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,967
Back then you had to rely on your wits.

87
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,646
Draw the cricoid forward,

88
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,483
keeping the trachea steady and tense.

89
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,611
Tenaculum, please.

90
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,990
I've noticed you in the halls.

91
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,994
I'm new.
Mr. Robertson hired me two weeks ago.

92
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:56,332
Her larynx is moving around too much.
Let's give her a little more ether.

93
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,217
When I started in practice,

94
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:11,472
each surgeon picked out his favorite nurse,
and asked her to be exclusive to him

95
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,474
in the operating room.

96
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,017
I've heard that.

97
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,187
No shortage of them
ended up getting married.

98
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,316
Surgical knife.

99
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,784
Damn it. Where's the cauterizer?

100
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,993
Here.

101
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,538
I'd be happy to have you assigned to me.

102
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,707
You'd be mine, so to speak.

103
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,420
I could be very helpful in securing
a long future for you here at the Knick.

104
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:58,060
The flower arrangements
should definitely have blue in them.

105
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,939
The color would be beautiful
with the napkins we've chosen.

106
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,817
Though we have to be sure
it's the right blue.

107
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,777
It would be awful to have them clash.

108
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,654
Yes, it would.

109
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:14,618
Should we match the flowers to the napkins
or the napkins to the flowers?

110
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,997
Cornelia?

111
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,168
Napkins to the flowers.

112
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,920
Very right.

113
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,672
Thank you.

114
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,676
Now, the other issues are discussing

115
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,930
the crystal, the silverware,
and the china place settings.

116
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:43,898
Come in.

117
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,066
Come in, don't be shy.

118
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,782
- What's your name?
- Um... Tom.

119
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,827
Thomas. Tom.

120
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:00,456
Well, Tom Thomas Tom,

121
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,374
I'm Susie.

122
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,793
And there's no need to be nervous.
I won't bite.

123
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:10,549
Thank you. I've just...
I've never been to one of these before, so...

124
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,761
Oh, well, if I saw a gentleman on the street
as handsome as you are,

125
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,805
I wouldn't believe
there was a fellow more worldly.

126
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,645
I don't know if I would
describe myself as worldly.

127
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,938
Thank you.

128
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,607
I've, um... I've never, um...

129
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,777
Well, I...

130
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,821
I... I've just never.

131
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,158
Well, to tell you the truth,

132
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:38,702
this is my first time, too.

133
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,747
Really? You've never?

134
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,834
This is my first week here
and you're my first client.

135
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,630
I saw you come in and I asked for you,

136
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,259
because I thought maybe you might
be able to help me through this.

137
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,681
Well, I... I could.

138
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,977
I do know a thing or two about...

139
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,020
About anatomy.

140
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:10,025
I'm very comfortable
with the human body and...

141
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,486
Then tell me,

142
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,115
what's this called?

143
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,451
- Your proboscis.
- Mmm.

144
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,330
And this?

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,208
Your scapula.

146
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,047
And this?

147
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,675
Your umbilicus.

148
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:37,428
And this?

149
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,762
Your pelvis.

150
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,098
Iliac crest, to be exact.

151
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:44,977
And this?

152
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:48,897
And this?

153
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,109
Oh, that's my...

154
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,319
It certainly is.

155
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,740
I don't think this is your first time.

156
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,908
It is with you.

157
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:15,758
What's that?

158
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,843
- What happened?
- I'm fine.

159
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,263
You're not. What happened?

160
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,975
I'm none of your business, Doctor.
You made that quite clear.

161
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,603
This is medical, not personal.

162
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,773
You'll forgive me
if I don't want you examining me.

163
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,108
Lucy, what happened?

164
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,111
My father beat me.

165
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,697
Why?

166
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,951
Because I confessed my sins
and humiliated him.

167
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,456
Would you care to guess
what those sins might have been?

168
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,333
No.

169
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,836
- The next time I see that son...
- You're too late.

170
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,298
He said he made more than
enough money in New York

171
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,217
and left to go back home this morning.

172
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,928
Well, he's lucky.

173
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,393
I would have hurt him
a whole lot worse than he hurt you.

174
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,356
You think he's the one who hurt me?

175
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:17,736
Mrs. Gianoulis, your son needs
to have his tonsils removed. They're infected.

176
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,074
What about the others?
You take them out, too?

177
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,827
No, just Alexi needs it, not the rest.

178
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,080
But I leave them with Alexi. I go to work.

179
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,457
No, no.

180
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,334
Mrs. Gianoulis...

181
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,629
Look, look, Mrs. Gianoulis,
look, these are your children.

182
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,924
You had them, they're your responsibility,
not anyone else's.

183
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,218
You take them with you to work
or take them home,

184
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,636
or whatever, but they can't stay here.

185
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,264
They stay here. They clean, they cook.

186
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,349
- Just take them home.
- I can't pay.

187
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:06,201
I doubt that Barrow will want to add this room
to the tours that he's been giving to donors.

188
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,458
What did Abigail say?

189
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,168
She's considering it.

190
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,921
In the meantime,
I'm continuing with my addiction studies.

191
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,673
Anything interesting so far?

192
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,924
Not yet.

193
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,470
As far as I can tell,
addicts have no difference in their organs

194
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,889
or physical characteristics to non-addicts.

195
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:31,477
There's nothing that makes them
more susceptible to addiction

196
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,773
and nothing that can be removed
or treated to cure it.

197
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:41,361
Given the exterior state,
which we found most of these drunks,

198
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,740
you would assume that the interior
would tell some sort of tale as well.

199
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:49,161
Yeah, but aside from the typical scarring
of the liver, nothing.

200
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,707
Even my examination
of Dr. Mays' corpse was inconclusive.

201
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:57,586
And that man was most certainly a drinker
if there ever was one.

202
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,421
Well,

203
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:05,636
I can't say that I'm not relieved that his death
occurred on your watch, and not on mine.

204
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,347
Something is making them do it.

205
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,099
And if it's not the body,

206
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,019
it must be the brain.

207
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,028
Our fire insurance will cover
the damage to the surgical theater,

208
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:28,700
and I have started a memorial fund
in Dr. Mays' name.

209
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,203
For the benefit of the widow?

210
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,830
No, the new Knick.

211
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,376
And many of Dr. Mays' friends at his club

212
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,755
have already donated generously
to the new vented and fireproof

213
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,758
Dr. William H. Mays etherizing rooms

214
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,262
that will now be added to the plans
for the new hospital.

215
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,808
With your permission, of course.

216
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,977
It's a fitting tribute.

217
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,356
I will instruct the architect
to make the necessary changes.

218
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:06,321
I personally handle the hiring
of every contractor.

219
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,408
With each, I make a standard deal.

220
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,578
Give us the best, charge us the most,

221
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,789
and give me a small percentage back.

222
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,875
The more we spend,

223
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,086
the more I get.

224
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:26,508
And with a building this large,
there's no shortage of craftsmen needed.

225
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,887
An army of plumbers, electricians, masons.

226
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,974
There are the specialists, too.

227
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,644
Hinge-makers, glass blowers, wood-carvers.

228
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,692
And I keep the plans changing
as often as I can.

229
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,737
Never an opportunity missed.

230
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:51,033
Every man has his talents.

231
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,620
Finding gold in the river, that's mine.

232
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,165
And how much gold have you strained
into your pan?

233
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,417
So far?

234
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,879
In the range of $12,000.

235
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,385
That's a sardine in a fisherman's net.

236
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,888
We here at Tammany, we prefer whales.

237
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,892
But it's not a bad thing
to hold on to a sardine now and then.

238
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:22,731
So, from now on,
15% of your construction costs,

239
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,150
before your skim, comes to us.

240
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,987
That's a bit high, don't you think?
My contractors will balk.

241
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,447
No, they won't.

242
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,407
It's the going rate

243
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:37,162
for keeping things running along smoothly
as they have been.

244
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,373
And we'll show you how to game it right.

245
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:43,877
You give us our share,
we'll make sure you have no trouble

246
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,422
with the city, politicians, cops,

247
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,927
unions, thefts,
anything that might come your way.

248
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:58,809
Building a hospital's a noble cause,
and we here at Tammany want nothing more

249
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:02,104
than to support you
the best way we know how.

250
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:07,442
Well, thank you.

251
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:15,117
The oysterman was picked clean
by the time I got there.

252
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,538
I got some cod we can fry downstairs instead.

253
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:21,998
What are you reading?

254
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,500
Nothing.

255
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,045
You're hiding everything from me these days.

256
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,047
It's just a book, Luce.

257
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,887
"Transactions of the Association
of American..."

258
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,140
"Obstetricians and Gynecologists."

259
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:42,102
It's about women's bodies.

260
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,607
I've been treating some special patients
on my own since one of the doctors died.

261
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,610
And I want to do right by them, so...

262
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:54,197
"The covering is quite vascular

263
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:57,409
"and appears like thickened..."

264
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,453
"Musculoperitoneal."

265
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,414
It's a membrane that lines the abdomen.

266
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,666
- Ew!
- It's not that bad.

267
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:10,088
If you want to be a doctor,
I suppose you have to like these things.

268
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,632
There are no woman doctors.

269
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,302
Then it's about time we had one.

270
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,512
I'm not smart enough.

271
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,975
You're smart enough to treat
those special patients on your own.

272
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,561
You haven't killed any of them yet, have you?

273
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,645
No.

274
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,190
Then maybe you know more than you think.

275
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,568
- Come on, we're late.
- You're a madman.

276
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,404
It's fun, isn't it?

277
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,406
Onto the 7:00 a.m. train
to New Orleans...

278
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:37,532
Phillip.

279
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,537
Yes, well, at least she'll make the barges
up by the river by the next day.

280
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,626
Well, it's better that than they limp east
for three days.

281
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,045
Damn it, man, get off that thing.
It's lunchtime.

282
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,297
You'd have one in your automobile,
if you could.

283
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,299
Give Edison some time.

284
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,384
I'll wager he'll figure it out.

285
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,220
So, this is a nice surprise.

286
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,389
We so seldom get to have lunch together.

287
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:05,894
This isn't the surprise.
They are waiting in the other room.

288
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,067
- Ah, Henry.
- Dad.

289
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,986
Neely, I was worried
you two weren't gonna make it.

290
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,656
Traffic. Now, if there was a subway...

291
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,491
Henry, not today.

292
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:23,829
Today we are celebrating
Algernon and his wife.

293
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,915
His wife?

294
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,792
Surprise!

295
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:33,255
Our man went off and got married
and never breathed a word.

296
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,174
Cornelia, may I introduce Mrs. Opal Edwards?

297
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,260
Opal, this is Cornelia Showalter.

298
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,095
Very pleased to meet you.

299
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,391
Our first trip to Paris
was for the '89 exposition.

300
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,811
When they opened the Eiffel Tower.

301
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,271
What did you think?

302
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,441
Oh, Cornelia and I nearly fainted at the sight.

303
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,402
You saved that until they lit it up
in the evening.

304
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,320
No, it's a marvelous feat of engineering.

305
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,364
It's a stain on a perfect city.

306
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,491
That's a bit dramatic, isn't it, Opal?

307
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,618
She's a performer. There's always a flair.

308
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,287
No, it's how I feel.

309
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,956
You had reservations
about it yourself, Algernon.

310
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,709
What the tower shows to me is progress.

311
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,753
I mean, that even the impossible is possible.

312
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,423
That's a virtue I instilled in my children.

313
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,216
Algernon as well.

314
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,218
- Is that so?
- Mmm.

315
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:23,263
Opal, we cannot emphasize enough

316
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:27,475
how impressed we are with what Algernon
has been able to accomplish.

317
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,395
Well, I certainly benefitted
from your progressive thinking.

318
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,356
Well, he means the world to us.
Doesn't he, Neely?

319
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,150
He does.

320
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,777
If that's the case,

321
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,739
then why are his parents
not invited to this lunch?

322
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,741
- Excuse me?
- Opal.

323
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,118
This is a celebration, as you put it.

324
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,245
So, why is it that they
can't sit here with us

325
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,915
instead of having to stay beneath the house
waiting for a bell to be rung?

326
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,666
Because
that's not how things are done.

327
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,378
Pardon me, then.

328
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,133
I suppose we have different definitions
of the term "progressive."

329
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,555
Are we ready to clear plates for dessert,
Captain, sir?

330
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,360
What were you trying to prove back there?

331
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,195
Am I not allowed an opinion?

332
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,030
Or is that also too progressive?

333
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,240
You were trying to pick a fight.

334
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:27,452
They talk as though they are responsible
for your success instead of you.

335
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,539
He simply said that he was proud of me,
not proud of what they did for me.

336
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,541
There is a big difference.

337
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,711
It was unfair.

338
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,506
You're right.

339
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,677
I apologize for being unfair
to those rich white people.

340
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,808
I got enough, I'll buy myself a decent bottle.

341
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:53,937
A little short, there's a rotgut hang,
Swedish, by the water.

342
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,856
Sells penny beers and two-cent whiskeys.

343
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,859
Jeez,
what's two-cent whiskey taste like?

344
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,112
Not like whiskey.

345
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,406
Wendell.

346
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,657
John.

347
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,242
I think I can help you.

348
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,078
I don't go in for no religion shit.

349
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,830
I don't either. I'm a doctor.

350
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,039
Not interested.

351
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,043
You interested in clean clothes,
three meals a day,

352
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:20,255
and a much more comfortable bed
than the one you're currently sleeping on?

353
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,133
Buy me a bottle, I'll let you know.

354
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,209
Mary.

355
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:21,483
Evening.

356
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,486
Glad all you fancy ladies could make it.

357
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,822
I'm sure there are lots of people uptown
who think you've gone shopping

358
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:28,907
or to the hair parlor.

359
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,408
I don't like being called here
by the likes of you.

360
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,660
And I don't give a good goddamn!

361
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,539
We're not out there anymore.
We're in here now.

362
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,292
Now listen.

363
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:44,005
My Harriet has got a real God-fearing
gavel-banger putting her on trial

364
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,341
and he ain't giving her a fair shake.

365
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,051
That's not our concern.

366
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,845
I'm making it your fucking concern.

367
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:56,476
Each and every one of you uptown ladies

368
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,311
came to me for the fix.

369
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,357
And my girl did it for you, safe and secret.

370
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,692
Secret?

371
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:07,695
Look around. We all know each other.

372
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,365
I doubt any of you will be tattling,

373
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,076
considering your shared circumstance.

374
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:18,665
But I know one girl
who could slabber on like the church gossip.

375
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:23,169
Lawyer puts her up there on the stand,
hand on the Bible,

376
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,797
swearing to God to tell the truth.

377
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,050
A nun like Harriet

378
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,970
is likely to have a bout of conscience,

379
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,975
confess to what she done,
and who she done it with.

380
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,936
Naming names.

381
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,730
Spilling the whole thing.

382
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,279
Newspapermen there,
writing everything down

383
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,197
for their evening editions.

384
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,993
By the next morning, you'll all be famous.

385
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:58,329
What do you want from us?
We can't stop the trial.

386
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,456
But your fellas can.

387
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:05,503
I doubt you was letting penniless shine boys
put the bat in the cave,

388
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:09,591
so I want you to go to these powerful fellas

389
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,509
who emptied their bags in you,

390
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,553
and let them know

391
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,724
that they can either use their money
to get this gone now,

392
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:22,187
or it's you and them on the stand next.

393
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,441
Off with ya!

394
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,172
You think they'll do it?

395
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,216
Your guess is as good as mine.

396
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:55,011
But as far as I'm concerned,
we're even on favors now.

397
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,808
So, when they finish their baths,
put them in a separate area of the ward.

398
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,938
And keep the medicine cart away from them.

399
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,359
Dr. Thackery, there's an emergency
in exam room four. Mrs. Alford.

400
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:17,992
What happened?

401
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,911
She had a seizure in her home.

402
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,205
Chimney sweep saw her through the window.

403
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,790
I insisted they bring me here.

404
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,543
Thank you, Dr. Grindin. I'll take over.

405
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,425
I'm so embarrassed.

406
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,096
I was making breakfast.

407
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,391
Next thing I know,
I wake up with cracked eggs all in my hair.

408
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:47,355
I'm really scared now, John.

409
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,191
I know.

410
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:21,514
It could be a while
before the malaria takes effect.

411
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,101
Looking forward to it.

412
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:50,877
My whole life, these men who were
supposed to show us how to live our lives,

413
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:56,090
we are supposed to respect
and trust and honor them.

414
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,635
Well, they've all disappointed me

415
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:04,640
and betrayed me and thrown me away.

416
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,103
Why do I let them?

417
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,273
Why do we let them?

418
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,818
It doesn't make any sense.

419
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,238
And I'm sick of it.

420
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,285
God tests us all.

421
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,960
All I know is I'm not getting what I deserve.

422
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,589
What is it you think you deserve?

423
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,134
Something better.

424
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:48,768
My daughter Ethel attends
the Brearley School.

425
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,895
Her Latin is coming along.

426
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,856
And Leonard attends Trinity.

427
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,483
Quite the sportsman.

428
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,403
And he's named after my father.

429
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,029
The fishmonger.

430
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:04,117
My father not only sold fish, sir,

431
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,744
he smelled of fish, he talked to fish,

432
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:10,665
he dreamed of fish, he was besotted with fish.

433
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,169
He actually believed
he could breathe underwater.

434
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,798
It's true. It's true.

435
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,635
But I wanted something else.

436
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,222
This, to be quite frank.

437
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,518
And I think we can all agree
it beats the fish business.

438
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:34,564
We'd like to think so.
Now, who's your sponsor?

439
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,692
It was Dr. Mays,

440
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,945
but I think we're all aware
of the recent tragedy.

441
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,157
A dead man can't sponsor a live one.

442
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,076
It's in the bylaws.

443
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,090
It takes a little while to get up here,
but it's worth it.

444
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,676
Do a lot of Negroes
live this far uptown?

445
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,054
Starting to,
especially after last year's riot.

446
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:10,099
Don't need to live cheek by jowl
with people who are trying to kill you.

447
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:12,101
Maybe you should consider it as well.

448
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,978
There are new buildings going up everywhere.

449
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,897
There are barely any farms left.

450
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,484
But with the Knick moving uptown,
this might not be a bad location for me.

451
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:21,569
That's if they take you with them.

452
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:22,987
They will.

453
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,323
You're so sure of your patrons,
the Robertsons?

454
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:26,532
I am.

455
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,826
And Thackery knows my worth.

456
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,913
What's this area called?

457
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,624
Harlem.

458
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,251
Algernon.

459
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,753
Russell.

460
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,089
Hello there. Hi.

461
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,759
Good to see you.

462
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,895
What?

463
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:59,023
You have a gray hair.

464
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:01,776
Where?

465
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,195
It's right there.

466
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:10,743
I haven't told you,
but I have a terrible disease.

467
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,620
What disease?

468
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,498
- It's called aging. Mmm.
- Oh.

469
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,918
Very slow, but eventually
all my hair will turn gray,

470
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,545
I'll lose all my teeth,

471
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,797
I'll have to walk with a cane
and inevitably die.

472
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:24,966
There's no cure.

473
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,718
- Maybe I shouldn't be near you.
- Mmm. It's too late.

474
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,846
It's highly contagious.
And, sorry to say, you've caught it.

475
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:34,475
Even with my eyes,
I can see the first signs right there.

476
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:37,645
You say one word about a hair or a wrinkle,

477
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,230
I will break your fingers.

478
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,898
Sorry, my hearing isn't
what it used to be either.

479
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:42,817
What was that about your wrinkles?

480
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,507
I'm finally being let out of the lab,

481
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,551
if only for one procedure.

482
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,844
Bertie.

483
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:14,140
To assist Dr. Zinberg in the removal
of a traumatic keloid of the median nerve.

484
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,017
What's that?

485
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:21,647
It's extra tissue on a nerve in a woman's arm
that causes her not to have any use of it.

486
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,608
- So, it just hangs there?
- Mmm-hmm.

487
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:24,775
Ew.

488
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,903
- Clara.
- She probably doesn't have much sensation.

489
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,282
Could you imagine not being able to
feel things with your fingertips?

490
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,162
It's routine work.

491
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:39,498
Clearly he's not going out
on much of a limb with you.

492
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:43,419
I think it means Bertie's
passed Dr. Zinberg's initial test.

493
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,921
He knows what he's got in the boy.

494
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,051
I'm not sure it's that spectacular, Mother.

495
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,344
Agreed.

496
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:54,597
Bertram's still a long way
from getting the man's trust.

497
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,809
He knows you're special.

498
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,193
Are you all right, Mother?

499
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:08,611
Of course.

500
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,530
Who wants more peas?

501
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,494
I'll definitely have some. Thank you.

502
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,426
Cigars and scotch.

503
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:35,262
This is a first for us.

504
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,351
I suppose I should
have done this with you sooner.

505
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,106
You're a man now.

506
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:51,737
And you'll need to be, as I have good reason
for having you here for a talk.

507
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,072
You do?

508
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,956
You noticed your mother struggling at dinner.

509
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,792
Yes, I did.

510
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:09,338
It's been going on for a while
and it's gotten worse.

511
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:13,884
Has she seen anyone?

512
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:17,888
We've been to Presbyterian Hospital,
Women's Hospital, and Roosevelt.

513
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,349
Two experts at Columbia as well.

514
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:24,645
And? What's the diagnosis?

515
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,148
An esophageal mass.

516
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,152
When was this taken?

517
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,570
Last week.

518
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,115
It has to be removed.

519
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:37,825
How?

520
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,287
It's taken over her esophagus.

521
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:44,373
There's no way to remove it
without tearing out her throat.

522
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,500
Well, it can't stay in there.

523
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,336
There's no procedure.

524
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,923
We've been to all the best men in the city.

525
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:55,259
If it comes out, it kills her.

526
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,553
If it stays in, it kills her.

527
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,058
Does she know?

528
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,229
I haven't told her yet.

529
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:12,568
But your mother was
an exceptional nurse in her day.

530
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,906
She knows something's very wrong.

531
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,866
How old is she?

532
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,284
Forty-nine.

533
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,870
Terrible.

534
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,747
I am sorry.

535
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:28,626
My grandmother
unfortunately died of the same

536
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,920
when I was in primary school.

537
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:33,756
And in all the years and
with all the advances,

538
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,925
we still haven't licked it.

539
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:42,515
The best we can do for your mother
is make her feel as comfortable as possible.

540
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,059
Various opiates to ease her pain.

541
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:50,648
I know a very good private nurse
who could stay with her at your home.

542
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,067
Thank you, that's very kind.

543
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,488
But I'm not prepared to
surrender her just yet.

544
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,491
I came in early this morning
and read what I could find

545
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,244
on procedures that have showed promise.

546
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,705
Promise is not proof.

547
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,544
It's all still more hope
than anything else, I'm afraid.

548
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,674
Well, I would at least
like to look into it further.

549
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,092
Of course.

550
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:22,930
As long as it doesn't
take you away from your duties here.

551
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:24,723
She's your mother.

552
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:28,811
But I caution you, Dr. Chickering.

553
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,648
Don't let that cloud your judgment.

554
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:52,459
Cornelia, there's something
Phillip wants to tell you.

555
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,920
There is?

556
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,466
I have to do some traveling for my father.

557
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,595
Well, where are you going?

558
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:07,016
Allen County, Ohio, near a place called Lima.

559
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:11,520
We have an oil refinery and the kerosene
we're producing isn't selling like it used to.

560
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:14,648
Edison's killing us
with his electric bonanza.

561
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,693
Nobody's lighting with kerosene anymore.

562
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:21,614
Yes, we need to find a use for all that oil
or shut it down.

563
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,283
Well, how long will you be gone?

564
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,912
A few weeks. A month, maybe.

565
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,539
Well, you can rest easy, Phillip,

566
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:34,460
knowing that we'll take delicate care
of your sweet Cornelia while you're away.

567
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,770
I'll be back shortly.

568
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:56,732
Just have to run a few errands
and then we'll have lunch.

569
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,192
That's fine.

570
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,748
Come on.

571
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,629
Spare some change, Miss?

572
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:03,090
- I can't.
- We haven't eaten today.

573
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,718
- Just a penny.
- No, leave me alone.

574
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,601
Temperature is 103.

575
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,271
That's up two degrees since this morning.

576
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,605
Vomiting?

577
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,399
Four times already.

578
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:23,610
Headaches are constant.

579
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,489
She's in the throes of it now.

580
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,119
My big concern is the jaundice.

581
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,289
Do you think it's cirrhosis?

582
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:36,832
That's incredibly rare.

583
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,042
Afraid so.

584
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,754
We thought all we had to deal with
was a hurricane,

585
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,631
but now we've added a twister in the mix.

586
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,717
Dr. Gallinger?

587
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:49,970
There's an urgent call for you downstairs.

588
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,228
I tried to get away, but
then I tripped and I fell.

589
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,814
And they came towards me,
so I started screaming.

590
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,650
- Are you hurt?
- I don't think so.

591
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,405
Where were you?

592
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:12,785
I had an appointment.
I didn't know she had gone out.

593
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,120
I'm sorry, Everett.

594
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,331
I just wanted some fresh air.

595
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,375
It's all right.

596
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,795
What happened to the thieves?

597
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,840
One slipped into a sewage drain
and got away,

598
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,426
but we got the other one right here.

599
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,804
Let me see him.

600
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,306
Name's Paulo.

601
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,934
Dago. Born over there.

602
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,103
Come here a little while back.

603
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,188
We've picked him up a time or two before.

604
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,898
Mostly kid stuff.

605
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,567
Stand up.

606
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,242
Filthy little bastard.

607
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,706
Not so brave, are you now?

608
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,047
Let's go.

609
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,139
- Where's Mr. Whitting?
- He ain't coming.

610
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,890
What do you mean he's not coming?

611
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,643
I had a bit of trouble with the finances.

612
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:23,063
I'm sorry, Harry. I'm sorry.

613
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,320
Where's your attorney, Miss Dolan?

614
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:33,574
He's sick, Your Honor. He's got the flu.

615
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:38,328
I don't think he'll be
defending me, Your Honor.

616
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,581
And I can't rightly defend myself.

617
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,333
I know you think little of me, but...

618
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,961
If you'll just shut your trap, Miss Dolan,

619
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,213
I'm dismissing the case.

620
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,966
Dismissing the case?

621
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,011
I've reviewed everything and
found there to be no more reason to proceed.

622
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,889
Your Honor,
the state strenuously objects.

623
00:41:56,973 --> 00:42:00,267
We have evidence,
corroborating witnesses, a good warrant.

624
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,061
Used for the purpose of entrapping a citizen.

625
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:06,023
Miss Dolan is to be released
and her record expunged.

626
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,609
I think we deserve
more of an explanation than that.

627
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,985
I don't.

628
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:13,864
You are free to go, Miss Dolan.

629
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,992
Case dismissed.

630
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:35,177
Oh, that son-of-a-bitch spirochete
is still wiggling away.

631
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:39,181
- What's her temperature?
- Holding at 106.

632
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,974
Needs to go higher.

633
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,477
She's cooking to death as it is.

634
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,729
Given her other complications,
we can't wait any longer.

635
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,564
I know, I know. Just let me think.

636
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:49,149
What is there to think about?

637
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,819
Show her some mercy.
You're frying her brain.

638
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,664
Give her the quinine.

639
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,838
Edwards, wait.

640
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,717
- Get the door.
- Jesus Christ.

641
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,856
This will get her fever higher.

642
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,316
What drugs are you taking?

643
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,110
- Nothing.
- Bullshit.

644
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,112
No sane person would do...
This will kill her.

645
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,281
What's the alternative? Huh?

646
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,825
More seizures. More spasms.

647
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:43,370
Headaches that feel
like knives twisting in her skull.

648
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:47,332
I know about living
on the edge between life and death.

649
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:50,460
It's a matter of will and
she has plenty of it.

650
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,754
I won't stand here and watch her die.

651
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,798
We swore to first do no harm

652
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,217
and we violated that
the moment we began this.

653
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:58,427
It's over.

654
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:00,053
Not until I say.

655
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,589
Quinine, now.

656
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,926
So, this is your famous truck.

657
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,928
This is her. Hop on in.

658
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,596
We'll go for a proper celebration.

659
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,181
No more cornmeal mush.

660
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,225
What you need is a nice big T-bone

661
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,894
with some suds to wash it down. I'm buying.

662
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,646
- You don't have to do that.
- Ah...

663
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:34,648
I want to.

664
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,359
What's better than being free? Huh?

665
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:50,288
And after that, we'll go
for a nice warm piece of pie on the way home.

666
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,417
- Home?
- Yeah.

667
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,001
You're staying with me.

668
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,378
I got my place all fixed up.

669
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,921
Put an extra bed in the parlor for you.

670
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,674
Had a lady down the hall
make a curtain to go around it.

671
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,552
You want me to live with you? You're joking.

672
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,053
No jokes, Harry.

673
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:07,931
You need a place to live and I'm offering.

674
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:11,017
Besides, I owe you
for keeping me out of it with the cops.

675
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:13,186
I need a place, but not with a man.

676
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,938
Ah, come on, it's on the up and up.

677
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,983
Besides, the church
ain't watching you no more.

678
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:21,611
They may not be,
but I won't bring any more shame to my faith.

679
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,655
And I won't be sharing any home with a man.

680
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,240
It's not a fucking lovebirds' nest.

681
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,534
We'd be roommates is all,
sleeping in different rooms.

682
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,910
It doesn't matter.

683
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,370
Well, where will you go, then?

684
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,289
There's a home for fallen women

685
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:35,542
run by the Little Sisters of Mercy
on Bank Street.

686
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:38,503
Could still go for that slice of pie.

687
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,172
All right.

688
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:43,592
I'll get the apple,
you get the peach and we'll share.

689
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:44,759
Deal.

690
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,230
Well, it's getting late.

691
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,066
I'm going to go to bed.

692
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,443
Are you staying up?

693
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,653
For a bit. Good night.

694
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,280
Good night, dear.

695
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:06,508
You get one meal a day.

696
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:12,305
You'll have a week to find a job
and start paying towards your keep.

697
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:17,602
You'll also be responsible
for 20 hours of work around here every week.

698
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,272
I'm a decent cook and I was a nurse.

699
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,023
You're on toilets.

700
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,943
We didn't want you here.

701
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,194
I'm getting that.

702
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:28,738
It's only by the grace
of our charitable Christian hearts

703
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,448
that you were allowed to come here.

704
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:33,535
- And I'm grateful.
- I don't care what you are.

705
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:35,245
Here's your bed.

706
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,872
It'll have to do you for now.

707
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,086
Are there any sheets and pillows?

708
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,840
Dreadful. What kind were they?

709
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:48,300
Italian.

710
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,760
Dark-haired, dark-skinned?

711
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:53,179
Yes. And small.

712
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,807
Southern, most likely, then.

713
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:00,353
An entirely different breed
than what comes out of Florence or Milan.

714
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:04,190
Criminals, all of them.

715
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:09,904
They see vulnerability
in someone good and decent like Eleanor

716
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:12,282
and they can't help themselves.

717
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:15,160
Why aren't people outraged?

718
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,537
Eugenics is a new science.

719
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:22,417
It's up to us to sound the alarm
and spread the word.

720
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:27,297
However, it is not enough
to get the people to see the problem.

721
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:31,009
It's getting them
to have the will to do something about it.

722
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:34,262
Closing the ports to all immigrants
would be an excellent place to start.

723
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:37,891
It would be, but that
requires political power

724
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,352
and the courage to act

725
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:43,897
and not be taken in
by the pitying hand-wringers.

726
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:48,109
We know we need
a more permanent approach,

727
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:51,196
a medical solution

728
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:55,283
to stop the growth of what has already
passed through our doors.

729
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,119
How? They breed like animals.

730
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:02,082
And how do you stop
an animal from breeding?

731
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,336
You neuter it.

732
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:11,132
Sterilization.

733
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,761
On a mass scale.

734
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:45,375
Excuse me.

735
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,128
I was told that the Speight
family lived here.

736
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,130
Inspector Jacob Speight.

737
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:51,881
Oh? He's dead.

738
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:54,217
I know, but the family?

739
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,428
Up and left all of a sudden right after.

740
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:58,304
Maybe off to her family somewhere.

741
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:01,474
They got out so fast,
I didn't have time to ask.

742
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,643
Thank you.

743
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,556
John?

744
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:08,351
John.
