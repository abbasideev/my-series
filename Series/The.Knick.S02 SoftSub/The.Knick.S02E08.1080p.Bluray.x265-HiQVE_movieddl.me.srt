2
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:54,971
Well, he's already half-embalmed.

3
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:59,142
Let's get him up on the table
and finish the job.

4
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,574
Can I get you anything else, Eleanor?

5
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,909
You can stop treating me like an invalid.

6
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,703
I feel much better.

7
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:26,461
I even think I might have been able
to manage the ball.

8
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,588
I would have loved to have gone.

9
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:33,009
I was just afraid you weren't
up to it physically.

10
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:38,264
I may be up to more than you realize.

11
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,350
Everett...

12
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,565
I think it's time for us
to rebuild our family.

13
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,864
Leave the light on.

14
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,443
Note the effect on the pupils of
a few drops of adrenaline chloride.

15
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,364
It dilates.

16
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,492
So what? It's to be expected.

17
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,454
Is this the extent of your research?

18
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:48,793
Dr. Zinberg insisted on
the incremental approach to laboratory work.

19
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,753
This isn't incremental.

20
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,714
This is immobility.

21
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,925
Well, there's one other thing
I've been working on

22
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,594
you might find somewhat more interesting.

23
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,638
Potassium chloride.

24
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,571
Cardiac arrhythmia.

25
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,240
Sorry, Bertie.

26
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,200
Afraid you lost bunny.

27
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,995
Uh-uh?

28
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,788
What are you doing?

29
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,540
You might want to stand back.

30
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,917
The effect is usually instantaneous.

31
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:38,217
Now that's what you should be working on.

32
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,264
Dr. Thackery, you need
to come with me right away.

33
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,765
Where is he?

34
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,896
You think I'm messing?

35
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,647
Mr. Brockhurst.

36
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,150
I'm here for my girls.

37
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,527
That ship has sailed.

38
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:01,532
I suggest you put the gun away and leave
before I'm forced to call the police.

39
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:04,952
Call the police!
You're the one who's guilty of a crime here.

40
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,788
This is theft. Those girls are my property.

41
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,999
Give them back the way they were before.

42
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,334
I can't do that.

43
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,127
No, listen.

44
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,253
Listen to me.

45
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:18,549
So many Siamese twins have asked me
to perform this operation.

46
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,845
There's... There are some
sisters in my office right now.

47
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,598
They're Swedish.
They're 12 years old.

48
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,475
- Bullshit!
- They're blonde. They're blue-eyed.

49
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,144
They're beautiful. They're...

50
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,938
They're attached at the rib cage,

51
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,231
so I can't separate them.

52
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,901
But... But...
But a man like you can make a tidy profit.

53
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,444
Let me see them.

54
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,112
They're in my office. That way.

55
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,864
No funny business.

56
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,411
Good job.

57
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,415
Believe it or not,
that's the first time I ever got to use that.

58
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:20,695
I wonder how you have the good fortune
to acquire such substantial sums of money,

59
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,321
and so quickly.

60
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,740
Well, that's no concern of yours.

61
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,451
Perhaps it should be.

62
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,331
We can become partners
and share in each other's good fortune.

63
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,041
I can assure you,

64
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,546
the money in that envelope is all
that remains of any fortune of mine,

65
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,089
good or bad.

66
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,265
You're not gonna count it?

67
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,934
After our long acquaintanceship?

68
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,728
The girl is yours.

69
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:55,688
Can I give you a receipt?

70
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,607
Oh, no. No, that won't be necessary.

71
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,613
Then may I give you a piece of advice?

72
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,868
Take to heart the words
of the wise man who said,

73
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:13,956
"Who, being loved, is poor?"

74
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,001
Confucius?

75
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:19,837
Oscar Wilde.

76
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,509
I think we should sell this house.

77
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,220
There's simply not enough room.

78
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:32,725
Was that a thinly veiled hint that I should be
returning home sooner rather than later?

79
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,560
Of course not, my darling.

80
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,063
You can stay as long as you like.

81
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,733
We love having Dorothy here,
don't we, Everett?

82
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,737
Yes, I wonder if we need to impose
on her any longer.

83
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:49,200
You've been doing so well lately,
as demonstrated by recent events.

84
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,619
Oh, I'm sure it's no imposition.

85
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,581
And it does so brighten my day
simply to look at her.

86
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,250
Then why do you want to sell the house?

87
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:02,254
Because there isn't enough room for all
the children we'll have.

88
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:09,470
And it would be nice for them to have
a backyard so they can play on the grass.

89
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,852
- Dr. Gallinger?
- Yes?

90
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,189
Frank Moorhouse of the New York
Detective's Bureau.

91
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:24,318
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour,
but may I have a word?

92
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,570
Of course. Please come in.

93
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,788
My wife, Eleanor. Her sister, Miss Walcott.

94
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,666
May I present Detective Moorhouse.

95
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,961
I'll get straight to the point.

96
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:46,507
I understand that you are acquainted
with a Dr. Henry Cotton.

97
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,675
Yes.

98
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,720
I'm sorry to have to inform you
the doctor's dead.

99
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,764
Poisoned.

100
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,643
Well, what happened?

101
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,062
That's what we're trying to find out.

102
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:05,151
I've been retracing his movements in the days
preceding his death,

103
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,736
hoping to identify a likely suspect.

104
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:12,825
His appointment book says that he dined here
the night before he died.

105
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:17,163
Did he say anything that suggested
he feared for his life?

106
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:19,999
No, I don't think so.

107
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,418
I'm sorry to interrupt, Everett.

108
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,920
May I offer you a hot cup of tea?

109
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,675
Well, that'd be very kind of you,
Mrs. Gallinger.

110
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,552
Thank you.

111
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,680
Everett, could I trouble you
to light the stove, please?

112
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,892
Would you excuse me a moment?

113
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,019
- Please, won't you have a seat?
- Yeah.

114
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,318
- Biscuit?
- Uh, no.

115
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,627
I'm sorry, Everett.

116
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,588
I didn't think they'd catch me up so soon.

117
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,217
Catch you up so soon at what, dear?

118
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,428
Well, I killed Dr. Cotton.

119
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,018
I put this in his soup.

120
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,155
Why?

121
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,074
Why?

122
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,036
You told me you credited him with
how well you've become.

123
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,121
- Why?
- Oh, Everett.

124
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,706
Can't you see?

125
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,459
I'm not well at all.

126
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,821
Don't say anything.

127
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,656
Let me handle this.

128
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,168
Forgive me.

129
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,297
My wife and I were overcome by the news.

130
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,675
I was just telling the detective
a little of your history with Dr. Cotton.

131
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,302
- Remarkable man.
- Mmm.

132
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:41,974
What's more, I'm proud to say, a real bond of
friendship developed between us

133
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,768
during his treatment of my wife.

134
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,565
Milk and sugar?

135
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,983
Milk, please.

136
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,373
This one's for you.

137
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,996
Mr. Dominczyk,

138
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,334
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

139
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,381
The hospital's board has decided
to close the ward.

140
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,259
There's only you left.

141
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:04,139
And frankly, I have no idea how to help you.

142
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,810
You were hophead?

143
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,146
Cocaine.

144
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,900
And heroin.

145
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,486
How did you stop?

146
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,074
A woman is helping me.

147
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,202
A friend.

148
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,288
We talk.

149
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,543
Maybe I'll talk to her.

150
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,504
- How's the fit on this one?
- Uh.

151
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,590
- Not sure yet.
- How can you not be sure?

152
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,135
It ain't like trying on a pair of boots.

153
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,513
Takes a bit of concentration.

154
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,475
Blood flow is important,
but so is a snug fit.

155
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,644
Yeah, well, You sure know a lot
about a fella's pecker

156
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,021
for someone who's been avoiding them
her whole life.

157
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,357
I'm just saying that if this is
too uncomfortable,

158
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,443
we can try it out on a stray dog instead.

159
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,862
Or maybe you could quit your gobbing.

160
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,738
Make yourself useful

161
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,867
so I can maintain myself here.

162
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,870
Useful how?

163
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,622
I don't know.

164
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,875
Sing me a song.

165
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,377
A song?

166
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,254
Yeah.

167
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,924
Could put me in the proper mood.

168
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:25,637
But nothing about God or saints
or fucking baby Jesus.

169
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,265
I ain't singing nothing dirty.

170
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,309
Why, you know something like that?

171
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,393
No.

172
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:32,978
Oh.

173
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,981
What about, uh...

174
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,610
My Wild Irish Rose?

175
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:47,868
My wild Irish Rose

176
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,496
The sweetest flower...

177
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,122
Yeah, no.

178
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,502
No, that voice is just making
the thing retreat

179
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,170
and look for cover. Ooh!

180
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:02,090
Oh, that's working for me, though!
Do that again!

181
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,847
On to new business.

182
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:13,560
The search committee has been tireless
in its quest to identify a builder

183
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,355
to finish construction on the new hospital

184
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,483
without further delay
or unanticipated expense.

185
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,612
After careful consideration, we are pleased
to nominate for the job

186
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,699
Mr. Raphael Warren from the firm
Tate, Warren, and Bond.

187
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,328
His CV is in front of you,
but I think you're already

188
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:35,541
acquainted with his work, especially
the lavish hotels he's built in midtown

189
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,292
for Colonel Astor.

190
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,003
And he has the added benefit of
being highly recommended by my son.

191
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:43,715
So if there are no objections,
I move we put this nomination to a vote.

192
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,968
- All in favor.
- Aye.

193
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,553
Mr. Barrow.

194
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,226
Mr. Warren.

195
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,853
- Right there, sir.
- Thank you.

196
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,526
Mr. Warren, welcome to the Knick.

197
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:07,239
I just have one thing to say to you
and I hope you'll take it to heart.

198
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:11,493
Your brief with us,
in a word, is to economize.

199
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:19,209
In my experience, economizing
is not always the best economy.

200
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:22,754
But I've looked over your
architect's blueprints

201
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,758
and I believe you'll be pleased with my
revised cost estimates.

202
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,427
Good.

203
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,095
Then Barrow is your man.

204
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,558
Mr. Warren, may I say I look forward
to a fruitful working relationship.

205
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,268
Well, that's settled, then.

206
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,854
If there's no further business,
I move to adjourn.

207
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,230
Aye.

208
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,275
Thank you, gentlemen.

209
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,651
Congratulations.

210
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,278
- Thank you so much.
- Very pleased to have you.

211
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,030
Pleasure to be here.

212
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,489
Mr. Barrow, a word.

213
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,824
- Welcome, Raphael.
- Thank you so much.

214
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,286
Now, my office is just downstairs.
Would you mind waiting in the lobby?

215
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,704
Of course.

216
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,917
Mr. Barrow.

217
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,211
Herman.

218
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:09,926
You will be pleased to know that
the club has voted to grant your membership.

219
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,054
Really?

220
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,932
You know, I had given up hope.

221
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:20,228
Well, you deserve it, if only in recognition
of all your hard work here.

222
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,230
Now you're a man on the way up, Herman.

223
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,274
You make the most of it.

224
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,820
Oh, and make sure that the club secretary
has your bank draft in the sum of $2,000

225
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,239
by the close of business today.

226
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,077
I thought the annual membership fee
was $200.

227
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,328
Oh, it is.

228
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:40,123
But that's in addition to the $2,000 that each
member's being asked to subscribe

229
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,917
to the club's expansion.

230
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,502
We're building a ladies' wing.

231
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,920
Oh.

232
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,546
Money's not a problem, I hope.

233
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,423
No, consider it done.

234
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,591
Well, good day.

235
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,233
Dr. Thackery.

236
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,110
Thank you for coming.

237
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,612
This lady says that she knows you.

238
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,031
Really?

239
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,826
- I don't believe I've had the pleasure, Miss...
- O'Connor.

240
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,787
You did this to me, remember?

241
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,998
Straightened my nose with part of
an old gold earring.

242
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:27,170
Sorry, I... have no
recollection of this whatsoever.

243
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,589
At Cromartie.

244
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,717
I paid you in heroin.

245
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,053
Excuse me.

246
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,891
Everyone knew you were the famous
Dr. Thackery.

247
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,075
You say I fixed it with a gold earring?

248
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,161
It belonged to my mother.

249
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,873
Well, I'm afraid your mother wasn't
entirely truthful.

250
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,418
It isn't gold and it's corroding.

251
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,463
I suspect that's what's causing the swelling.

252
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,340
Um, I'll get the admitting nurse
to schedule a surgery

253
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,177
and I'll replace it with something
more permanent.

254
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,595
Like what?

255
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:19,681
Something else.

256
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,643
I have to warn you, I'm all out of heroin.

257
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,646
It's on the house.

258
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,150
Thank you.

259
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,747
What... What... What's the matter with you?

260
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,377
I've been getting these terrible
stabbing pains.

261
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,172
Is it worse after a meal?

262
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,132
No, it's not an ulcer.

263
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,886
Well, let's go next door so I can perform
a proper examination.

264
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,471
No, thank you.

265
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,974
At least allow me to look at your stool.

266
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:07,103
Not even if you went up there
and got it yourself.

267
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,398
It's a fine house, Mr. Barrow.

268
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,984
I can think of any number of prospective
buyers to show it to.

269
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,694
At your convenience, of course.

270
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:20,575
To be honest with you, Mr. Stern, I currently
find myself in a bit of financial distress.

271
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:25,163
Consequently, I haven't time to show
the house publicly.

272
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,833
I don't understand.
How do you intend to sell it?

273
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,460
Well, I was thinking that you might
buy the house.

274
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,170
As an investment.

275
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,507
If you were willing to pay cash for it today,

276
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,593
I am sure I can make it worth your while.

277
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,054
Have you a figure in mind?

278
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,307
How much is the house worth?

279
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,142
$5,000.

280
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,063
It's yours for $3,500.

281
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,232
Can you clear out by the end of the week?

282
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,483
Of course.

283
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,446
The procedure's called septoplasty.

284
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:03,702
I place you under general sedation and then
I'll insert this into your nasal cavities.

285
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,162
What is it made of?

286
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:07,873
It's celluloid.

287
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,751
It's the material they
use to make motion film.

288
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,545
It's strong.

289
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,046
It's malleable.

290
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:18,884
I'll use it to give support when I trim
the excess flesh.

291
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,141
Thank you, John, for doing me this favor.

292
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,854
I know you had reservations about it.

293
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,232
I wanted to ask you one small favor.

294
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,985
Of course.

295
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:41,823
Would you consider talking to a patient
of mine on the addiction ward?

296
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:46,870
I... I think you may be able to help him
the way you helped me

297
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,164
when I operated on the twins.

298
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:50,999
Oh, I...

299
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,921
Don't you think that the man would only
be further upset

300
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,007
by talking to someone who looks like me?

301
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:03,011
The important thing will be the effect
your words have on him.

302
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,473
I mean, he doesn't have to see you at all.

303
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,314
A gentleman wishes to speak
with you, ma'am.

304
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,279
Hello, this is Effie Barrow.

305
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:24,532
Mrs. Barrow, I'm sorry to bother you,
but your husband was otherwise engaged

306
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,242
when I telephoned the hospital.

307
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,536
Could you convey a message to him for me?

308
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,121
Who's speaking, please?

309
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,916
Please tell him the Kenney Vacuum Sweeping
System has been installed

310
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,960
as per his instructions.

311
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,462
Vacuum sweeping system?

312
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,880
It's the newest thing.

313
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,424
It allows you to vacuum carpets
in any room in your house

314
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,803
using a portable tube connected to a
machine housed in the basement.

315
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,597
There's been no such installation here.

316
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,893
It's for the new house, Mrs. Barrow,
the one on West 74th Street.

317
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:55,563
Oh, dear me. I hope I
didn't ruin the surprise.

318
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:56,898
Be sure to tell him.

319
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:03,738
I can't decide if I'd rather see you
in diamonds or sapphires.

320
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,574
Why not both?

321
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,159
Why not?

322
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,121
Which do you think would
look better with your uniform?

323
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,708
I won't always be wearing my uniform.

324
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,128
Or anything else for that matter.

325
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,547
Neely, there you are.

326
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,132
What do you think?

327
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,802
Would Lucy look better in diamonds
or sapphires?

328
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,805
With those blue eyes?

329
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,640
Sapphires, I'm sure.

330
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:36,146
Well, I could sit in the lap of luxury
all day long,

331
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,356
but I best get back to work.

332
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,818
It was nice talking to you both.

333
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,488
Oh, so why am I fetching you here?

334
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,491
I was delivering thank
you notes for the ball.

335
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,870
Well, hop in.

336
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,371
I'm famished.

337
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,291
All set?

338
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,628
I've been investigating the death

339
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,298
of Inspector Speight
of the Health Department.

340
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,633
Phillip's father found out,

341
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:10,221
and since he objects to me doing anything
other than my matrimonial duties,

342
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:13,058
he's had men following me
whenever I leave the house.

343
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,353
I'm sure he means well.

344
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,486
Look, if it bothers you so much,
why don't I have a word with him?

345
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:25,820
That's not it.

346
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,739
What is it, then?

347
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:29,783
Oh, Henry.

348
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:34,996
My investigation took a terrible turn
and it's implicated Dad.

349
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,125
What do you mean?

350
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:44,506
He's violating maritime law,
immigration statutes, and he's...

351
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:02,899
He's been issuing second-class tickets to
passengers in steerage.

352
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:04,859
Why the devil would he do that?

353
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,736
Because the passengers are sick.

354
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,115
Second-class passengers disembark
right into Manhattan

355
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:13,660
and he's been bribing the port inspectors
here to look the other way.

356
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:17,539
So Dad avoids millions of dollars in fines
and return fares.

357
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,583
That's what Speight was investigating.

358
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,754
I can only assume Dad found out and
had him killed.

359
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,345
But do you really think he has the stomach
for murder?

360
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,305
The proof is in there.

361
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:39,936
He's responsible for the outbreaks of bubonic
plague here and in San Francisco.

362
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,148
There were outbreaks in Hawaii, too.

363
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:46,317
Perfectly timed to the arrival of our ships
from the west coast.

364
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,407
I guess he... He got desperate.

365
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:58,663
And this is how he tried to...
To right the ship.

366
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,419
I just... I can't believe it.

367
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,934
Dr. Gallinger.

368
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:21,519
How do you do, Dr. Warner?

369
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:25,481
May I present my wife, Eleanor
and her sister, Miss Walcott.

370
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,610
Ladies, pardon us a moment
while we discuss the arrangements.

371
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,201
I wanted you to see our day room.

372
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,870
I think your wife will
find it quite soothing.

373
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,758
She was formerly a patient of
Dr. Cotton's, no?

374
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,009
That's correct.

375
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,803
That's why I must insist that she undergo
no medical procedures

376
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,264
without explicit permission from me first.

377
00:25:58,349 --> 00:25:59,766
Put your mind at ease.

378
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:04,562
I don't share the late Dr. Cotton's enthusiasm
for surgical solutions to everything.

379
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,149
Her physical and psychological condition
will be carefully assessed

380
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:11,736
and a determination will be made
as to the preferred mode of treatment.

381
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,821
Will she be happy?

382
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:17,575
If she's going to spend
the rest of her days here,

383
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,121
I want her to have as fulfilling a life
as is possible under the circumstances.

384
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,165
We'll do our best to see that it's so.

385
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,840
I think this is a mistake.

386
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,927
This is how it has to be.

387
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,596
Please, don't leave me here.

388
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,373
Well, what do you think?

389
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:09,711
I think you're making
a mountain out of a molehill.

390
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:14,966
As I understand it, they'll need
more nurses at the new Knick, not less.

391
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,343
Sure, more like you.

392
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,221
Meaning what?

393
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,516
Meaning they'll need fewer girls like me.

394
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,810
You have two eyes, Lucy.

395
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:30,565
Henry Robertson has made over
the nursing staff into a beauty contest,

396
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:36,237
worthy of the new hospital's stylish
decorations and fancy pneumatic elevators.

397
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,948
And I'll thank you very much,

398
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:42,577
but a plain girl like me
is nobody's idea of an ornament.

399
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:44,579
No.

400
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,041
Lucy, you have a telephone call.

401
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,257
This is Lucy Elkins.

402
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:01,596
Yes, A.D. Elkins is my father. Who is this?

403
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,354
You follow me, please.

404
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:16,652
I found a card in his billfold with your name
and the Knickerbocker Hospital on it.

405
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,545
Reverend Elkins.

406
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,464
- Here, turn him over.
- Daddy?

407
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,592
Daddy? Daddy?

408
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,930
Lily was tanning his behind with a cat,
like always.

409
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,184
All of a sudden,
his eyes rolled back in his head.

410
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,479
Has he done this before?

411
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,898
Almost every day
for the past couple of months.

412
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,196
Daddy.

413
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,241
Daddy.

414
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,452
He suffered a paralytic stroke.

415
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,833
Is there anything we can do?

416
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,212
Best I can do is keep him alive.

417
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,719
Do you think he can hear us?

418
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:30,143
Well, his eyes seem to be
following you, so it's possible.

419
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,978
I'd like to wait until morning to leave.

420
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:17,231
Of course.

421
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,737
Well, you must be pleased.

422
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,240
With Eleanor's fate decided, you can continue
on your search for a husband.

423
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:29,368
- Don't let's be mean about it.
- Isn't that what you told me?

424
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:30,703
It is.

425
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,997
But you know I didn't
want it to end this way.

426
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:38,961
Although I do take
some comfort from the thought

427
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,964
she wasn't undone
by some inherited weakness.

428
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:47,261
So, it's unlikely I'll suffer the same fate.

429
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,558
I'm sure you won't.

430
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,021
Strong,

431
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,483
smart, beautiful.

432
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,699
You Walcott girls come from superior stock.

433
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:14,580
The same is true of the Gallinger men.

434
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:19,335
Naturally, my heredity
is identical to my sister's.

435
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,466
People often commented on it.

436
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,387
It's the eyes.

437
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,477
The fullness of your lips.

438
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:42,525
Will you look at that, Pounce?

439
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,569
That horse has got a big tit on its back.

440
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:46,654
That's a camel, you idiot.

441
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,906
Comes from Arabia. Ask Harry, she knows.

442
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:50,950
It's called a dromedary.

443
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,910
A camel has two humps.

444
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,745
I'd like two humps. How about it, Myrtle?

445
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,123
- Watch your mouth around the ladies.
- Sorry, Sister.

446
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,250
I'm not a sister anymore, Mr. Pouncey.

447
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,794
- Did she die?
- Who?

448
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,504
Your sister.

449
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,131
In a matter of speaking.

450
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:10,720
Look. Here's the Chamber of Horrors
I was telling you about.

451
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,681
- Who's up for a spook?
- Come on, let's go, Myrtle.

452
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,436
You coming?

453
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,271
I'll wait over here.

454
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,648
You're not on trial anymore, Harry.

455
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:25,234
There's nothing saying
you can't have a little fun.

456
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:27,653
Just not feeling right about it.

457
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,156
You've no more debt to pay.

458
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,783
God set you free, didn't he?

459
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,702
At least his men did.

460
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,871
Besides, you didn't take a vow of misery.

461
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,499
There's no harm in a few smiles now and then.

462
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,044
In 10 years or so,

463
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,465
chances are we'll be in the ground.

464
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:48,966
And I'd hate to think you
spent the last of it

465
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:51,969
slaving over a kitchen sink,
cleaning out sheep guts

466
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,555
for other people's good times.

467
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,266
Let's go.

468
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,936
- All right.
- Thatta girl. Come on.

469
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,088
Holy shit!

470
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,215
He just walked up and ate the whole camera.

471
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,883
I swear, it ate the whole thing. Look.

472
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,844
- How'd he do that?
- Maybe it was a really small camera.

473
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,514
Fuck!
He just ate the cameraman, too.

474
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,974
- This don't make no sense.
- Let's watch it again.

475
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,768
All right, hold on.

476
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,770
No, that's my last one.

477
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,773
Now, we can either watch this again

478
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,860
or we can go get some of those
good-looking confections they were selling.

479
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,863
- Candy sounds better.
- Candy sounds better.

480
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,075
And there we go.

481
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,702
There we go.

482
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,453
Look at this here.

483
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:02,915
Thank you, Thomas.

484
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,668
- You've been a real friend.
- Huh?

485
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,378
You ever think you'd call me that?

486
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,504
No.

487
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:11,966
Old Tom Cleary, the maggot ambulance man.

488
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,301
Boyo, the things you used to say to me.

489
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,721
Only because you were throwing
plenty of jabs at me.

490
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:23,060
I know it wasn't right, the way I treated you,
but I still don't got no love for nuns.

491
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,020
You...

492
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,733
Well, you won over my heart.

493
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,067
Truly.

494
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,069
And I can say the same.

495
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,741
- What are you doing?
- I was kissing you!

496
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,576
- What do you think?
- You're out of your mind.

497
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,327
What was all that talk, just then?

498
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,954
Mutual respect is all.

499
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,081
Is this why you brought me out here?

500
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,750
To show me a good time,

501
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,169
hoping I'd give you something
back for all that you've done?

502
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,879
Is that why you've done it all
in the first place?

503
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:52,423
- Was that your game?
- Hey, this isn't a game.

504
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,759
I got feelings for you, Harry.

505
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,428
As much as just said so as did you about me.

506
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:01,056
I certainly didn't.
You're what you always were.

507
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,684
I just turned a blind eye to it.

508
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,144
I'm going home.

509
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,856
And I'll thank you to stay
well clear of me in that place.

510
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,024
Jesus.

511
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:19,320
So,

512
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:24,992
Dr. Gallinger proceeded
with his little eugenics project after all.

513
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:28,787
How many are there?

514
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:30,956
Fifty-two.

515
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:35,669
All boys between the ages of 15 and 18.

516
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:40,132
I'm sure you'll agree
with how serious this is.

517
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:44,428
Dr. Gallinger is clearly
in breach of medical ethics.

518
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,766
These boys were operated on involuntarily.

519
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:51,143
Involuntarily?

520
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,313
Obviously.

521
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,274
They were too young to give
their informed consent.

522
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:02,029
- Does it say where the procedures took place?
- No.

523
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,824
No, I assume they took place
at this so-called Idiot House.

524
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,704
Well, I definitely don't approve.

525
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,208
But it's not illegal.

526
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,294
And it didn't happen at the Knick.

527
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,006
So I don't know what I can do about it.

528
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,506
Mrs. Alford,

529
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,218
may I introduce Mr. Dominczyk.

530
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:10,764
How do you do?

531
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,392
How do you do?

532
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,940
I don't understand why
I cannot look at your girl.

533
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,777
If I had a girl, I would let you look at her.

534
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:29,575
As I explained to you, the important things
are her words and the sound of her voice.

535
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:35,122
Looking at a beautiful woman would
simply distract you and lessen the effect.

536
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,460
Mr. Dominczyk...

537
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,381
I'm unsure how to begin.

538
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:47,509
Why don't you tell me a
little about yourself?

539
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,137
I am a steamfitter.

540
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,556
I'm also a drunk.

541
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,184
Yes, well...

542
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:59,480
Do you... Do you drink often?

543
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,316
Every chance I get.

544
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,569
That's what makes me a drunk.

545
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:10,115
You're right, she has a lovely voice.

546
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,460
Do you remember the first time
you took a drink?

547
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,422
No.

548
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:27,508
It was when I was a baby.

549
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,137
Your parents were the first
to give you spirits?

550
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,349
My mother would give me whiskey.

551
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:40,604
She would dip a rag in it
and give it to me to suck.

552
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,108
Why on earth would she do such a thing?

553
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,401
Had to keep me quiet.

554
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,085
Champagne?

555
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,090
What's the occasion?

556
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,468
First a toast.

557
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,647
To surprises.

558
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,900
All right, then.

559
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,278
To surprises.

560
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,162
What are we supposed to do now?

561
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:41,415
Smash our glasses in the fireplace
like Russians?

562
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:47,588
Effie.

563
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,048
I'm waiting.

564
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,592
Waiting for what?

565
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,051
My surprise.

566
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:55,137
What surprise?

567
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,099
Herman, you never were one
for the grand gesture.

568
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:03,061
I hate to ruin it for you,
but it's not my fault.

569
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,898
Your man telephoned for you here.

570
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,276
What man?

571
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:11,862
He didn't tell me his name,

572
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,989
but he told me all about the new house

573
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,783
and the remarkably modern vacuum system.

574
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,453
74th Street.

575
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:22,039
How stylish.

576
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,666
I see.

577
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,589
Well, Herman,

578
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,674
who is he?

579
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,219
He's an architect.

580
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,137
Formerly in my employ.

581
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:41,642
When were you planning on telling me?

582
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,854
I suppose now is as good a time as any.

583
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:51,944
Maybe we can drive round
and see it after dinner.

584
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,070
No.

585
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:57,115
No, Effie. You need never see the house.

586
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,747
What are you talking about?
Why on earth not?

587
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,375
Because

588
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,670
I intend to live in it with another woman.

589
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:15,592
I've also taken the liberty
of selling this house.

590
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:19,638
You may stay through the end of the week,
but then you and the children must go.

591
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,349
I've rented you an apartment downtown.

592
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:25,185
Two bedrooms in a walk-up.

593
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,607
Was that a grand enough gesture for you?

594
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,546
For Christ's sake.

595
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:24,322
Mrs. Alford, it's time.

596
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:35,041
Ready?

597
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,335
To look like me again.

598
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,379
Bertie.

599
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,027
Doctor, I have no pulse.

600
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,490
Dilated. She's having a reaction.

601
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,074
Drop the table.

602
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,829
Three, two, one.

603
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,127
Bertie, brandy and strychnine.

604
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:20,754
Still no pulse.

605
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,465
Lucy, pump her arms.

606
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:37,270
Take over.

607
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:46,696
Anything?

608
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,198
No, nothing.

609
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,370
What are you doing? What are you doing?

610
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:55,455
Limiting circulation.

611
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,832
Reducing pressure on her heart.

612
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,385
Take the tube out of her mouth.

613
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:20,373
Yes?

614
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,927
Do you still want me to leave tomorrow?

615
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,224
No.
