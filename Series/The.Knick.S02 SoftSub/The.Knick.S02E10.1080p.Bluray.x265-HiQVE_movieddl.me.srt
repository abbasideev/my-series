00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:11,420
http://hiqve.com/

2
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,483
All right, back away.

3
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,193
Back away.

4
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,487
Christ, what have you done to yourself?

5
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,030
Just get me out of here.

6
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:32,865
All right, come on.
I'll have you to the Knick in no time.

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,785
No, take me to Mount Sinai.

8
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,540
You do good work.

9
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,042
It was good work. Now it's gone.

10
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:45,128
Thanks to your good work.

11
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,255
What do you mean?

12
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,382
It ain't too hard to put together.

13
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,760
You got what you wanted,
the whole damn thing starts over again

14
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:56,180
and so does your skimming off of it.

15
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,224
You think I did this?

16
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:02,311
He collapsed a few days ago
and was brought here for examination.

17
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,815
An endoscope revealed
at least one ischemic section of bowel.

18
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,943
The likely cause
was his extensive use of cocaine,

19
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,530
in all forms, and other substances.

20
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,324
Heroin.

21
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,577
It was, uh, heroin.

22
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:21,789
But, uh, I don't think
it's got anything to do with this.

23
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,251
It may have masked the pain.

24
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:29,088
I should mention the patient is a physician.

25
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,593
The recommended procedure is resecting.

26
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:37,555
Once the patient is anesthetized,
we'll remove the necrotic areas,

27
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,391
and then, using elastic ligatures
and the McGraw method,

28
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:42,935
unite the healthy areas.

29
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,437
Questions?

30
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,939
Yeah, just one modification.

31
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,900
No anesthesia.

32
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,111
You want to remain awake?

33
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:55,490
I want you to use my, uh,
spinal block instead.

34
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,410
- I won't do it.
- Why not?

35
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:00,912
I don't believe in it.

36
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,706
You've read my paper.
You've seen the evidence.

37
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,919
I've also seen the papers
that have refuted your initial success.

38
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,630
Several cases of permanent paralysis.

39
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,549
Obviously performed
by incompetents.

40
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,316
Got the 95 from Minna O'Fallon's brothel.

41
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,778
They want to up their order for next week.
A third more of everything.

42
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,655
Put it in the tin.

43
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,536
Let's start getting the
next load in the truck.

44
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,955
This one's for Pinkey's Gentleman's Joint.

45
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,999
Four hundred condoms, 50 sponges.

46
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,668
- Box number 16.
- All right.

47
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,086
They'll owe you $90.

48
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,963
Stack it on there.

49
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:56,217
All right. Back in a jiff.

50
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,763
Just this list of
guests I've given you.

51
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,473
I had my mother take a look at it,

52
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:06,811
but she was so upset,
she didn't get very far.

53
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,689
So my judgment will have to suffice.

54
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:13,109
If someone was missed, so be it.

55
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,196
That's it for now.

56
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,992
Dinner, sir.

57
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,452
Nothing for me.

58
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,332
You should eat something.

59
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,129
You have it.

60
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,676
An apple or a pear, at least.

61
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,140
I haven't got any appetite.

62
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,738
I'm, uh...

63
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,949
I'm taking my mom

64
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,869
up to our house in Newport

65
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,622
after the funeral

66
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,916
to spend the summer.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,418
She needs to be away from all of this.

68
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,838
What about your work?

69
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:20,176
I can do most of it using the telephone.

70
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,309
There's also a guesthouse.

71
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,648
It has a beautiful view of the ocean.

72
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,985
I think you'll love it.

73
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,157
Are you asking me to come?

74
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,079
I don't know what I'd do without you.

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,250
Lucy. Lucy, please.

76
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,046
Things are bad enough.

77
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,675
Don't make me pine for you as well.

78
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,263
And it's a beautiful guesthouse.

79
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,226
The McKinleys stayed there
the summer before he won in '96.

80
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,228
Of course it is.

81
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,774
And I'm sure the future
president didn't visit

82
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,443
without the promise of a commitment
from your father.

83
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,199
Herman Barrow.

84
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,533
Yes?

85
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,411
Police Detective Tuggle.

86
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,164
Would you mind answering a few questions?

87
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,626
What sort?

88
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,338
About the fire that took
August Robertson's life.

89
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:07,593
Darling, would you wait in the carriage?

90
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,470
I'll only be a moment.

91
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,183
Your daughter?

92
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,852
No.

93
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:22,233
So, I'm supposing
she's not the current Mrs. Herman Barrow.

94
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,986
Sad as it is for my beloved children,

95
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,864
I'm divorcing their mother.

96
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,784
But this has nothing to do
with the hospital or my work,

97
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,994
so what were your questions?

98
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,001
You were in charge of the construction
of the new Knickerbocker?

99
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,878
I oversaw it.

100
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:46,465
The board of directors thought it best
to have me lead the project,

101
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,426
but that was mostly cost and expenditures.

102
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:54,515
The architect, a Mr. Frazier Wingo,
and then a Raphael Warren,

103
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,642
were in charge on the ground.

104
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,645
Yes, we've already talked to Mr. Wingo.

105
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:01,522
Really?

106
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:05,317
Well, I hope you found him
to be as untrustworthy as we did.

107
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,486
We terminated him weeks ago.

108
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,196
He's a scoundrel.

109
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,324
He thought you would say that.

110
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,286
Well, he's earned his reputation.

111
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,538
As have you.

112
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,041
Where were you on the night of the fire?

113
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,753
I was at home with Junia.

114
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,839
She can vouch for me.

115
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,176
And who will vouch for her?

116
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,052
Excuse me?

117
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,681
There isn't anything about her
that would make us doubt

118
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,435
her word as your alibi, is there?

119
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:44,398
What sort of man are you

120
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,818
that you think it's appropriate
to come to my dear friend's viewing

121
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:50,905
and insult me and my girl?

122
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,992
From now on,
if you'd like to ask some questions,

123
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,705
you will do so at the proper time and place.

124
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,875
Watch yourself, Detective.

125
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,378
One call, and I can have you
back-walking a night beat

126
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,798
in whatever filthy mick neighborhood
you come from.

127
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,888
We'll let you know
how the investigation progresses.

128
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,182
Excuse me.

129
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,819
You go in and see your mother yet?

130
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,825
Opal is keeping her company.

131
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,536
What're you gonna tell her about that eye?

132
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,415
Kicked by a horse?

133
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,042
My boy?

134
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,462
What did happen?

135
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,021
A fight.

136
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,523
Another one?

137
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,694
It was inevitable.

138
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,363
It always is with you.

139
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,741
How bad is it?

140
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,621
Bad.

141
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,377
The good captain gave you everything.

142
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,881
There's not a Negro in this city
who's had more opportunities than you.

143
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,718
Even that's not enough.

144
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,220
What do you have to be so angry about?

145
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,347
I'm angry for you.

146
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,404
I used to...

147
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,160
I used to sit down in the stables
and do my homework

148
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,662
while you tended the horses.

149
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:10,002
There wasn't a subject
that you couldn't help me with.

150
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,631
Smartest man I ever knew.

151
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,220
You could have been something more.

152
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,098
Something great.

153
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,602
Not just another man's coachman.

154
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,148
I am angry.

155
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,861
I'm angry that they made you
turn your eyes to the ground.

156
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,281
And then they made you
too scared to look up.

157
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,200
Boy,

158
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,787
you have no idea what I've seen.

159
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,249
If I hadn't learned to turn to God,

160
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,293
I wouldn't be here

161
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,462
and neither would you.

162
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,977
Got another batch of intestines for you.

163
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,648
Jewed the butcher down.

164
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,192
Saved us nearly a fin.

165
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,737
He offered me some sausages,

166
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,990
but I can't really look at encased meats
the same way anymore.

167
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,743
What's the matter?

168
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,995
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

169
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,249
The money. All that we earned.

170
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:35,087
There was over $300 profit
in that this morning.

171
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,841
You've got me.

172
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,676
- I took it.
- You had no right.

173
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,760
I made an investment.

174
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,721
- Investment in what? Another damn wrestler?
- In us.

175
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,057
- What do you mean "in us"?
- Harry!

176
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,560
- What're you doing?
- Rose.

177
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,020
- What're you doing?
- I am a man...

178
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,939
- You can't be doing this.
- ...what knows what he wants.

179
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,816
Thomas, please get up.

180
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,734
I've known that we were good together
from the very start.

181
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,153
Please get up.

182
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,071
I have had feelings for you
for a very long time,

183
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,698
and that hasn't changed.

184
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,536
I love you, Rose Dolan.

185
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,457
I'd be honored if you'd be my wife.

186
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,421
Are you gonna say something?

187
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:19,882
You're off your nut.

188
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,135
I am as sane as any man has ever been.

189
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,346
- I can't.
- Why can't you?

190
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,265
Because I can't.

191
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,558
Harry, please.

192
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,813
Just give... Give me a chance. What can I do?

193
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,065
While you're down there, pray.

194
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,080
A bit more.

195
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,293
More. Stop. Good.

196
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:01,298
So, which one of you has more experience
administering my spinal block?

197
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,551
I've done it several times with good success.

198
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,512
Then you do it.

199
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,889
Now, it was difficult
to tell from Zinberg's scope

200
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,557
just how much pus might be present

201
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,018
and if there's more than
one necrotic section.

202
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,646
Well, we'll just have to have
plenty of saline ready

203
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,023
in case I need to flush it out.

204
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,691
In case you need it?

205
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,610
I'll be performing the surgery.

206
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,445
On yourself?

207
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,948
- And we'll be...
- Assisting.

208
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,200
Thack, that's madness.

209
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,328
No, what's madness is using ether
regardless of the dangers.

210
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:35,582
I'm gonna prove we don't need to use it,
and I want people to pay attention.

211
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,377
And you think a circus stunt
is the way to do it?

212
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,546
Well, you'll watch, and
so will everyone else.

213
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,216
You'll read the journal
and the newspaper story.

214
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,552
You'd risk your life for publicity?

215
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,179
If it means saving people's lives, yes.

216
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,057
But from your position on the table,

217
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,268
you won't have the proper angles
to see what you're doing.

218
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,186
That's what the mirror is for.

219
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,147
So you're gonna perform it
backwards, essentially?

220
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,695
Thack, this is a routine surgery
if you'd let us do it.

221
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,321
We can have it done in a half-hour's time.

222
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,949
And people will still be
etherizing and killing.

223
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,034
It's overwhelmingly safe.

224
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,245
That's what I told Abby.

225
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,955
There could have been other factors at play.

226
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,040
She could have had a defect in her heart

227
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,835
or taken some medicine
that reacted poorly with the ether.

228
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,254
All the more reason to avoid it.

229
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,382
I'm not gonna help you kill yourself.

230
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,009
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

231
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,094
Self-surgery has been tried before.

232
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,763
Well, then, at least allow us
to handle the tricky parts.

233
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,433
No. It's very simple.

234
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,393
You either do it my way,

235
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,688
or you can excuse yourselves,
and I'll go it alone.

236
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:50,657
We still haven't gotten
the report from the insurance company.

237
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,785
They told me they believe the fire
was intentionally set.

238
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,579
Sounds a bit far-fetched.

239
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,540
I think they'll find it's more likely

240
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,792
the result of all the cost cutting
and speeding up

241
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,211
our new architect was doing.

242
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:06,340
Never a problem before he was hired on.

243
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:10,385
It does seem that this disaster
coincided with his arrival.

244
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,640
I've already got a list of new men
whom I have personally vetted.

245
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,311
Restarting this project
will be my highest priority.

246
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:23,065
I'm truly not interested
in the cause at this point.

247
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:29,029
In fact, I met with the insurance company
myself about it this morning

248
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,157
and negotiated a very favorable settlement.

249
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,826
Why would you do that
before getting the report?

250
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,539
Because my family is finished
with this endeavor.

251
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,957
I'm pulling the plug,

252
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:44,002
and we're going to use the settlement
to pay back the donors.

253
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,880
Henry, your father...

254
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,924
My father is dead.

255
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,844
So is his dream.

256
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,973
Mr. Havershorn,

257
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,725
if you're interested,

258
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,813
I'd be willing to sell you back your land
at the full price to do with what you wish.

259
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:07,317
I've received a letter of interest
from the Mount Sinai people.

260
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,570
I suppose I'll have no choice
but to sell to them.

261
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:14,157
That's sure to lose me some friends
on the Upper East Side.

262
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,160
But what's to become of this place?

263
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,622
I don't want to tell you
your business, Henry,

264
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,708
but I feel I owe it to your father

265
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,584
to provide my wise counsel at this time.

266
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,336
No, you don't.

267
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,923
I'll keep my own counsel from now on.

268
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,635
Gentlemen, my sister has always believed

269
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,847
in the good this place does
for the people down here.

270
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,891
And the need is only increasing.

271
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,186
Therefore, I have asked Mayor Van Wyck

272
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,689
to consider having the city
take over the Knick.

273
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,399
Hear, hear.

274
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,987
This is a terrible mistake.

275
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,337
Have you heard the news?

276
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,298
They're not going to rebuild.

277
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,927
We won't see a penny of that settlement.

278
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,263
That is Henry Robertson's business.

279
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,557
Oh, is it, really?

280
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:25,270
You have a sizable reputation,

281
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,315
and you'll be trapped on this sinking ship.

282
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,818
They're talking about
having the city take over.

283
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,031
Thack, that new hospital was to be yours.

284
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,950
It was being built around your genius.

285
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:43,955
We cannot let that juvenile decide our fate.

286
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,711
Now, we find a way to continue on
and get you what you rightfully deserve.

287
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:55,008
Did you know I'm a full member
of the Metropolitan Club now?

288
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,636
I've very powerful friends.

289
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,763
- Bully for you.
- Indeed.

290
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:06,144
What about the Thackery-Barrow Sanitarium?

291
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,229
Hmm?

292
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:11,233
All of the work you've been doing
with those drunks and the like.

293
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,820
I could have you up to the club.

294
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:18,782
We could put together a presentation.

295
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,200
We could get funding.

296
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:24,746
Look, I have nothing to offer
the drunks and the drugged.

297
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:26,915
I failed.

298
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,501
So we'll leave that part out.

299
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,965
Flowers keep getting delivered
every few minutes.

300
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,261
Downstairs looks like a botanical garden.

301
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,598
Your father really was beloved.

302
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,276
Phillip.

303
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,194
Yes?

304
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,448
I know I've taken you for granted,

305
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,450
and I shouldn't have.

306
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:09,165
I think a fresh start in
Ohio is what we need.

307
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,377
You'll come with me?

308
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,422
We'll get my mother
off to Newport with Henry,

309
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:19,384
and then we'll head west.

310
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,231
You'll make a fine oilman's wife.

311
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,567
I'll certainly try.

312
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,406
And you're sure Henry doesn't need you
at Robertson Shipping?

313
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,659
Well, I thought so,

314
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,453
but Henry's done an excellent job
of stepping in

315
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:49,414
and reassuring the whole company
they're in good hands.

316
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:53,335
The ships still sail,
the passengers and cargo are still en route.

317
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,838
I don't envy Henry.

318
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,257
Having to learn the whole business
so suddenly.

319
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,801
Well, he's got a good grip on the routes,

320
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:05,221
and he's been in charge of the ports
for years now.

321
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:08,683
I thought he only worked
on the routes and contracts.

322
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,936
Oh, no.

323
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,229
No, overseeing the ports was the first thing

324
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:16,274
Henry wrested away from your father
when he started.

325
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:20,111
Felt there were a great deal of savings
to be had if handled correctly.

326
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,156
Did the same thing when we were out
in San Francisco.

327
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,201
Turns out your brother
is quite the wharf rat.

328
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,006
Mr. Barrow.

329
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,967
Oh, for Christ's sake.

330
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,680
A few more questions, if you don't mind.

331
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,056
I do mind.

332
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,517
Perhaps you'd like to shake my hand first.

333
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,143
No, thank you.

334
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:57,232
So, why did you set the fire?

335
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,777
Insurance? Revenge?

336
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:05,031
I had nothing to do with that fire.
Nothing, God damn it.

337
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:08,410
This how the police operate now?

338
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,496
Accosting a man with accusations

339
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,416
in the sanctity of the bathroom
of his own club?

340
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,961
You keep trying to impress me,

341
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,881
but I don't impress as easily
as you or your kind.

342
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:24,175
Perhaps this will impress you.

343
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,013
I hope you're enjoying
your last day as a detective.

344
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,141
I'm starting to.

345
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:35,562
That new apartment of yours,
you paid in cash, right?

346
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,982
A lot of money for a man on a salary.

347
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,527
Not for one who works hard
and saves judiciously.

348
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:46,573
If you have any further questions,
you can refer them to my attorney.

349
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:47,699
You have one?

350
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,576
I will soon!

351
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,369
This interview is over.

352
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,455
Get out! Now!

353
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,676
Sorry about that.

354
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:10,847
This man has no sense of decency.

355
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,601
Well, that's the problem
with all of this fairness talk.

356
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:19,022
Everyone thinks they can speak to anyone
however they wish.

357
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:23,151
He wants to make a splash
with a big fish, and apparently I'm it.

358
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:28,239
And what was this clown's name?

359
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,159
His name was Tuggle.

360
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,037
Tuggle.

361
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,687
Neely.

362
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:03,274
I wasn't expecting you.

363
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,193
I know you weren't.

364
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,695
I know what you did

365
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,366
behind our father's back.

366
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:17,997
My investment in the subway. Yeah.

367
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,958
It's hardly a secret now.

368
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:25,463
Well, it looks like it's going to be
a roaring success.

369
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:26,631
No.

370
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,216
A fortune I will happily share
with the entire family.

371
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,760
I know what you did.

372
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,972
What did I do?

373
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:37,559
The bribes at the ports to the inspectors.

374
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,562
It was you

375
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,898
who let all those sick passengers
into the country.

376
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,194
You who brought the plague here
and to San Francisco.

377
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,822
- You who killed Speight.
- Neely.

378
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:55,827
You who murdered your own father
and tried to kill me.

379
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:00,331
Say something!

380
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,254
It's a shame you're not a man.

381
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,635
You'd have been named lead detective
in the city by now.

382
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:17,640
- How could you?
- How could I not?

383
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,271
Banks turning their backs on us.

384
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,191
Creditors bleeding us dry.

385
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:30,195
He was so consumed with his damn legacy,
we were going broke.

386
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,573
It was his fortune to lose, not yours.

387
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,741
He built it.

388
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,619
And he was squandering it!

389
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,621
Like a fool.

390
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,291
I saved him from that.

391
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,378
He's a titan again because of me.

392
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,297
You're making me sick.

393
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,466
He had to go.

394
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,639
It's as much your fault as it is mine.

395
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,433
How?

396
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:06,189
You told him about your little investigation.

397
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,193
He'd have figured it out it was me.

398
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,403
And he'd gone soft in his old age,

399
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:17,242
but not so soft that he wouldn't have
kicked me out of the business

400
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:21,371
and written me out of his will like that
for having done it.

401
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,458
You left me no choice.

402
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:29,337
Don't you dare try and lay this at my feet.

403
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,756
You took what you wanted.

404
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:36,219
And now I'm legally in control of the family

405
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,221
and all our holdings.

406
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,349
We'll see about that.

407
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:45,687
What will you do?

408
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,564
Go to the police.

409
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,817
Tell the newspapers.

410
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,110
Tell Mother.

411
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,904
No, you won't.

412
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,076
What evidence is there? Hmm?

413
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,245
You gave me everything you have.

414
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,454
The fire?

415
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,499
Well, I've already taken care of that.

416
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,419
It's only your word against mine,

417
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:16,217
and no one's gonna listen
to the rantings of a distraught housewife.

418
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,224
Neely,

419
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:27,145
you have an easy, comfortable life.

420
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,397
Go live it.

421
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:32,859
Be a good wife.

422
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:34,986
Start a charity.

423
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,030
Be impregnated

424
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:39,574
by your husband.

425
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,201
Name the firstborn after our departed father.

426
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:48,458
But you will do exactly as I say,

427
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,754
or you won't make it back to your carriage.

428
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,715
You're a monster.

429
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,971
And your one-woman crusade is over.

430
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,933
Is that understood?

431
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,396
Go.

432
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,202
Lucy.

433
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,455
Hello, Cornelia.

434
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:35,004
I am so glad you're here.

435
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,465
So glad you saw things my way.

436
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:46,224
Is Cornelia coming up to Newport with us
as well?

437
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:48,851
Afraid not.

438
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,229
Right, Neely-doll?

439
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:57,527
But tell Phillip I expect all the Showalters
up to the house for Independence Day.

440
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,530
Show them what
a real fireworks display looks like.

441
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:05,660
Should have had Wingo killed
when I had the chance.

442
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,872
A real man takes care
of his own business.

443
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:12,500
I am a real man, Junia.

444
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,587
I would delight in choking the life
out of that vindictive little fairy

445
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,465
if the police weren't following me
everywhere I went.

446
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,259
Look out this window.

447
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:25,721
Our view of the park
is now policemen on a bench!

448
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,685
They mean to arrest me. I know they do.
They want to destroy me.

449
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,814
- What about me?
- What about you?

450
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,234
Will I be put out onto the streets?

451
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:42,572
I wouldn't put it past them
to seize this place, the bloodsuckers.

452
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:45,074
You'd let them do that to me?

453
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:47,535
What will I do? Where will I go?

454
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,455
I don't know.

455
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,415
I don't know.

456
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:59,005
Anything in my name can be seized.

457
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:04,218
Even Effie can make a claim for it,
since we're still married.

458
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,556
This place.

459
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,309
This place is my only hope.

460
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,981
Listen, if they take me,

461
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:21,110
I'm going to need a loan against
this property to pay for my defense.

462
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:26,240
Well, I don't know how to do that.

463
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,659
Evening.

464
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:13,746
How long has it been
since your last confession?

465
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,164
Longer than you'd care to know.

466
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,877
There's no point in going through
all my wrongs. Besides,

467
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,880
God's already seen them.

468
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:25,925
They ain't all bad, you got to understand.

469
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:31,013
I take the sick to the
hospital lickety-split.

470
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,558
Save one every now and then.

471
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,395
All I'm saying is I'm an all right fella.

472
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,063
I know I am.

473
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,816
Then why are you here?

474
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,987
Love.

475
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:50,074
I asked a woman to be my wife.

476
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,327
She's hesitating.

477
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:56,664
Maybe she senses something.

478
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:02,169
Figured maybe I need to confess
before God lets her say yes.

479
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:05,756
See, me and her,

480
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:09,510
a ways back, we worked together.

481
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,887
That's when I started
having feelings for her.

482
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:15,766
And I know she was having
feelings for me, too.

483
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,978
But there was no way that I could

484
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:24,817
make her my own, seeing as how she was

485
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,030
married to the Church and all.

486
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,699
Then I figured a way out.

487
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,536
I set her up.

488
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,371
You set her up?

489
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:43,836
Told a copper I knew what she
was up to, and he set a trap for her.

490
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,590
And I knew the Church
wouldn't look too kindly on it.

491
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,175
And you didn't.

492
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,218
Took away her habit, her name.

493
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,596
Banished her.

494
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,932
Left her with nothing and nobody except me.

495
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,560
You manipulated
a nun's excommunication?

496
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,896
She was a fucking abortionist!

497
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,525
I know you read about it.

498
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,070
You gonna start defending her now, hmm?

499
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,366
I did you all a fucking favor.

500
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:17,370
Now, I didn't see the law coming down
as hard as it did on her.

501
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,413
That surprised me, I can tell you.

502
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:24,251
And it hurt me something terrible
to see her so broken.

503
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,546
But I got her out of that trouble.

504
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,759
She's better now.

505
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,803
Happier than I ever seen.

506
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:38,599
Happier than when she was a nun,
that's for sure.

507
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,061
What exactly is it
you want forgiveness for, then?

508
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,106
No, no. Not forgiveness.

509
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,193
I guess just a prayer or something

510
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:53,447
so God can get her
to accept me as her husband,

511
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,450
admit that she loves me, too.

512
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,830
So we ain't alone anymore.

513
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,428
Fuck it.

514
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,815
Where would you like to go?

515
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,985
I... I don't know.

516
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:35,156
Europe? South America? The Orient?

517
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,790
How far will that take me?

518
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,920
What about Australia?

519
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:59,346
Junia, it shouldn't come to this.

520
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:02,641
I've been told it won't come to this,

521
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:06,687
but I'm being cautious for your protection.

522
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,022
Thank you, Hermie.

523
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:20,826
Good.

524
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:24,455
And this is for the loan
against the apartment.

525
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,208
And this money will be in your bank account.

526
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:33,881
And this money is for your lawyer.

527
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,802
Ezekiel Marshall of Martin,
Burt and Marshall.

528
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,387
Yes. Very good.

529
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,975
And this, lastly, is the power of attorney.

530
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,436
Sign right here.

531
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,016
All right.

532
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:53,687
All right. All right. All right.

533
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,800
Well, that does me, gentlemen.

534
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:28,722
Pardon me, Mr. Barrow, sir.

535
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,641
Ah.

536
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,644
What is it?

537
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:39,274
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior earlier, sir.

538
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:45,781
The fire is being ruled an accident.

539
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,157
Hmm.

540
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,160
An electrical accident.

541
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,664
My superiors wanted me to come here

542
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,376
and tell you personally.

543
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:04,717
Well, thank you, Detective.
Apology accepted.

544
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,135
Now, good day.

545
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:15,102
- Your deal, Barrow.
- Ah, yes.

546
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,522
What is wrong with your hands?

547
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,940
No idea.

548
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:23,861
They've felt odd lately.

549
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,697
I thought I'd have one of my doctors
check me.

550
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,116
Well, have an X-ray done.
Get to the bottom of it.

551
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,826
They're miraculous.

552
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,828
Oh, I know.

553
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:36,623
I've had dozens of them.

554
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,254
I want to take our message
on the road.

555
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:46,383
Rather than follow Europe,
I want to lead them for a change.

556
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,761
Bring eugenics to the continent.

557
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,889
Teach them a little something
about American scientific discovery.

558
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:55,517
Precisely. And who better
to deliver that message

559
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:58,562
than a strong, handsome man
such as yourself?

560
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,564
I'm flattered, but...

561
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,940
But what?

562
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:05,235
You'd prefer to stay here
and be the subordinate to a Negro?

563
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,405
And to the man who chose
that Negro over you?

564
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,325
I was considering searching
for another position.

565
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,619
Well, you've found it.

566
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,412
We'd travel first-class.

567
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:19,541
You'd be paid for your speeches,
and there'd be a generous stipend.

568
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,628
This is a message that needs to be spread.

569
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:28,092
And there are a lot of wealthy people
who are willing to fund such an effort.

570
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,053
We'd be away for at least a year.

571
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,557
Would I be able to bring a companion?

572
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,392
Of course.

573
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,979
You're not giving me
a lot of reasons to say no.

574
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:43,440
Well, that was my intention.

575
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:46,693
You'd be the traveling prophet of eugenics.

576
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:50,364
An evangelist
for the preservation of the human race.

577
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,284
When would we leave?

578
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,994
First of the month.

579
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,289
We'd take the White Star
and start in Germany.

580
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,542
As good a place as any, I suppose.

581
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,328
Gentlemen.

582
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,914
Please direct your attention
to the center of the ring,

583
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:24,208
where I will amaze you
with a feat so extraordinary,

584
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:28,879
it has never been seen before by you
or anyone else in the history of mankind.

585
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,302
I have come to believe that our use of ether
is both cavalier and irresponsible.

586
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,598
The drug is risky and overused,

587
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,267
and I will prove today that a man
can be operated on

588
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:44,269
with no general anesthesia,

589
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:50,567
and that that same man
can perform the operation himself.

590
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,404
Dr. Gallinger and Dr. Chickering

591
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:59,326
are injecting me with a 2% cocaine solution
directly into my spinal canal,

592
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,789
which will block all signals of pain
from my lower half to my upper.

593
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:08,252
This is a technique I pioneered myself

594
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:13,006
and one I know to be completely safe

595
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,383
if done correctly.

596
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,513
How are you gentlemen doing back there?

597
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,515
Just fine.

598
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,684
When you assembled here

599
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,311
see today what can be done
without general anesthesia,

600
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:30,315
I have no doubt
that we will all look back and realize

601
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,902
how many lives were saved on this day.

602
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,781
Hold still, please.

603
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,302
Scalpel.

604
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:14,192
As I work through several layers of dermis,

605
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:16,820
Nurse Baker will follow along
with the electric cauterizer.

606
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:17,988
Nurse.

607
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,740
Thack, at least allow us to do that.

608
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:23,076
As you can see,
I will only let the nurses assist me,

609
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,286
as I don't want to be accused

610
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,998
of not having performed
the entire procedure myself.

611
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,835
A high-wire walker is only thrilling to watch

612
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:36,465
if there's no net below
to save him from disaster.

613
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:37,799
Nurse Pell, retractors.

614
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:03,158
As I work my way through

615
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:05,118
the intestine,

616
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:09,998
it seems there are several necrotic areas
which will need resecting.

617
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:13,418
Six, by my count.

618
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:17,381
Much worse than originally assumed.

619
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:21,218
Dr. Thackery, perhaps you could resect
one or two of the sections

620
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,386
to prove your point,

621
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,513
then Dr. Gallinger and I can continue on.

622
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:26,973
Or you could close,
and we could reconsider our options.

623
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:30,060
Thank you, doctors,
but I will finish what I started.

624
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,229
The show must go on. Clamp.

625
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,323
Clamp.

626
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:19,526
The first two-inch section has been removed.

627
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,945
But before I sew the ends together,

628
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:26,741
I will try to remove the next section.

629
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:39,129
As you can see, this particular area

630
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,965
is much more difficult to access.

631
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,551
- He's cutting too close to the superior...
- I know.

632
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:49,681
Bertie.

633
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:55,228
He's working too closely
to the superior mesenteric.

634
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,606
I know. Dr. Thackery...

635
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,608
Your unsolicited opinion is noted,

636
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:03,236
but this tack is the only way
to get to this section.

637
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:07,991
- Fuck!
- You've cut yourself.

638
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,576
Jaeger's needle and silk.

639
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,244
- Just clamp it off.
- Stay back!

640
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:19,211
Seems like I've nicked the abdominal aorta.

641
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,824
My peripheral vision seems
to be dulling a bit.

642
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,120
Almost

643
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,791
a vibration at the edges.

644
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,131
Body temperature has begun to drop.

645
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,023
This is it.

646
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,824
This is all we are.

647
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,392
Clamp that aorta, Bertie.

648
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:00,186
Suction!

649
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:05,400
- Clamped.
- Lips are blue.

650
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,943
Fingernails, too.
Let's get him down.

651
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:09,696
- No pulse.
- Shit!

652
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:16,036
- Tube's in.
- Almost got it sewn.

653
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,625
- Anything?
- No.

654
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,084
Come on, damn it.

655
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:25,545
Where're you going?

656
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,520
Come on.

657
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:07,480
I read your letter on the train
down from Newport.

658
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:19,159
If that's what you want to do,

659
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:21,327
it's your inheritance.

660
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:24,789
And I'll gladly pitch in as well.

661
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:26,166
No, you don't have to.

662
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:30,086
I want to. It seems a noble cause.

663
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:34,883
And it's only money, right?

664
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,180
Thank you, Henry.

665
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:46,311
With my eye likely gone,
I'll need another vocation.

666
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:52,776
Are there even any patients
left on that ward?

667
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:55,612
By all accounts, it was a failed experiment.

668
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,530
It's worth further study.

669
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:02,494
I owe him at least that.

670
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:47,914
This is not the way the lady did it.

671
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:52,710
How did she do it?

672
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:54,671
I never look at her.

673
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,593
Is that what you would prefer?

674
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,595
I think so.

675
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,279
How are you feeling?

676
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,490
Not so good. I can't sleep.

677
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,411
I could give you something.

678
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,080
I don't want to sleep.

679
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,457
I'm having bad dreams.

680
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,090
Really?

681
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,519
Tell me about them.
