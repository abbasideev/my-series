"It wasn't difficult to gain entry

00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:10,236
"into one of these private institutions.

"on the other side of the looking glass.

"What was done to the patients one could
hardly define as treatment."

11
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,714
Do you think this could be
Cromartie where Thackery is?

12
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,883
- Well, there are...
- Listen to this.

13
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:35,678
"The doctors would routinely do
what was known in the halls as quieting,

14
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:39,140
"drugging the patients
into a lethargic stupor."

15
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,893
The reporter, did he take the drugs?

16
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,936
I don't know.

17
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,105
The article was actually written by a woman.

18
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,191
Genevieve Everidge.

19
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:50,651
Look.

20
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,537
Are we going to let them back?

21
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,207
Well,

22
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,502
it may not be up to us.

23
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,129
Report from Cromartie
is that you walked away.

24
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:13,966
No, no, no, it turned out to be
a dangerously run facility.

25
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:18,638
I managed to escape thanks to Dr. Gallinger.

26
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,098
And your time with him has cured you?

27
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,726
I'm here because I'm well again.

28
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:27,438
I, uh,
I haven't taken any cocaine for some time

29
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:30,608
and the, uh,
the heroin drug that they, uh, treated me with

30
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,402
is completely gone from my system.

31
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,006
He's back.

32
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,384
What? Where?

33
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,678
I need to be busy again, to work,

34
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,514
and I am confident in my ability to do so.

35
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,224
Well, I for one am not.

36
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,642
Nor am I.

37
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,727
You'll have to be monitored.

38
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,187
Monitored? How?

39
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:11,399
You'll need approval
for any degenerate medications

40
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,942
you take out of the dispensary.

41
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,654
And we'll assign someone
to look at your skin

42
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,199
to be sure there are no signs
of injection of any kind.

43
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:21,784
Oh, good. For a moment there,

44
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,870
I thought it would be something humiliating.

45
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,163
You started this by humiliating this hospital.

46
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,250
And yourself. So, let's call it insurance.

47
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,419
And it's not negotiable.

48
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:35,214
- And this is after everything?
- Damn it, Thack.

49
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,427
That debt was paid long ago and you know it.

50
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,555
This is your catastrophe.

51
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,098
Dr. Thackery,

52
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,436
we are doing this
because we want you to succeed.

53
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,898
We are all better off when you have
a scalpel in your hand.

54
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,817
I don't plan on doing much surgery.

55
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,320
Oh, for God's sakes.

56
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,114
What do you plan on doing with your time?

57
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:04,035
I want to do some research
into what causes addiction.

58
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,498
What we're banking on
is your reputation as a surgeon.

59
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:14,003
Your towering stature can help us
finance the new Knick.

60
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,256
The donors want to see you

61
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,508
performing magic in the surgical theater,

62
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,386
not you hunched over some microscope.

63
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,430
That's a waste of your time, at that.

64
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,933
I don't see how excessive use of narcotics

65
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,976
is worthy of scientific study.

66
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,436
Because it needs to be cured

67
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,397
and it should be treated
like any other disease.

68
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,274
Addiction, a disease?

69
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,443
I've never heard of anything so absurd.

70
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,363
Addiction is a failure of personal morality.

71
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,657
I'd like to test that theory.

72
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,618
I'd happily inject you with cocaine
and heroin for a week

73
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,621
and see if your morals
and character are still intact.

74
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,290
I think everyone here would agree
that's an insane suggestion.

75
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,292
- Indeed.
- I'd like to see it.

76
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:56,128
- Henry.
- Call it a disease if you wish,

77
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,048
but it's still the disease
of indigents and lowlifes,

78
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,425
present company excluded, Doctor.

79
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,220
It bedevils the rich and the poor alike.

80
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,682
I've certainly seen
my fair share of soused heirs

81
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,809
and addicted heiresses.

82
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,477
Cromartie was full of them.

83
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,022
If I can find a cure,
then the new Knickerbocker

84
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,692
will become the leading hospital
in treating the epidemic

85
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,070
and we can charge handsomely
for that treatment.

86
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:26,075
If we did decide to go with your plan,

87
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,578
how would you go about finding

88
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,831
this addiction cure?

89
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,085
I have no idea.

90
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,135
I'm terribly sorry, okay?
We're gonna make this up to you.

91
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,929
We're gonna get you all fixed up, okay?
I'm terribly sorry.

92
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,099
We're supposed to bring people
to the hospital, not send them there.

93
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,851
Jesus Christ.

94
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,771
Tom.

95
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,441
Tom!

96
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,235
We got a problem.

97
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,154
This thing came off and knocked
some lady in the head.

98
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,281
Knocked her out cold.
Her husband's real pissed off.

99
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,449
I don't give a fuck about them.

100
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,743
Get it fixed before this guy meets his maker.

101
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,370
I guess old Cleary hasn't read
the legend of John Henry.

102
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,997
Fuck off, Pete.

103
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,088
- That the stabbing from up on 23rd Street?
- Fuck off, Pete!

104
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:24,383
We'll have this fixed in a jiff
and be on our way.

105
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,137
Which way does it go?

106
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,764
Are you fucking serious?

107
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,140
I've never done it before.

108
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,185
- Take him.
- All right, let's load her up.

109
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,896
Sure thing, gentlemen. Thanks, Cleary.

110
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,402
I was so worried about you.

111
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,197
I've been sick about it.

112
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,159
Praying every night.

113
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:20,124
And then you went missing
and I thought I'd never see you again.

114
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,751
I needed to get better.

115
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,089
Are you?

116
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,049
I am.

117
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,932
What's wrong?

118
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,269
John.

119
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,108
I love you.

120
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,032
And you love me.

121
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,578
I know you do.

122
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,831
You said it to me.

123
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:05,211
I said and did a great many things
that I shouldn't have.

124
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,505
Lucy,

125
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,885
we can't be together.

126
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,649
Don't say that.

127
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,694
You love me.

128
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,365
We just need time together.

129
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,368
Look. Listen, listen. Listen.

130
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,870
You are young and beautiful

131
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:42,665
and there is so much possibility in you.

132
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,417
Look, if we end things now,

133
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,294
few people will be any the wiser

134
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,546
and you can start anew.

135
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,634
I don't want to start anew.

136
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:58,430
- I want to continue on.
- No, look.

137
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,183
- It's the only way this can be.
- No! No!

138
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,351
Lucy.

139
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:04,728
No. No.

140
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,857
I think you should go.

141
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,821
I can't.

142
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,537
I was sent here by Mr. Barrow...

143
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,374
To check you for needle marks.

144
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,044
To map them.

145
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,759
He thought a colleague
would be too humiliating, so...

146
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,140
'Cause I know all your hiding places.

147
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,242
Thank you, James.

148
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,455
Ahoy, Neely doll!

149
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,587
Dad told me you bought one of those things.

150
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,380
It's miraculous.

151
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,174
Oh, careful you don't get electrocuted.

152
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,051
It's how they're gonna run
the subways when they're built.

153
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,344
- Really?
- Mmm.

154
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,679
I wish I had known you were coming.
I'd have given you a ride.

155
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,015
I didn't know myself until this morning.

156
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,933
My in-laws sat me down last night

157
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,894
and told me I must decide how to keep

158
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,730
the Showalter name in the society pages.

159
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,358
Eunice wanted me to join
her art patrons' group

160
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,485
or do something with the new libraries.

161
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,195
Sounds dreadful.

162
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,905
- You want me to talk to Phillip?
- No.

163
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,865
I owe it to him to do my best.

164
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,534
He was so sad about leaving San Francisco.

165
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,371
Besides, I've decided
I'm going to help organize

166
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,122
the fundraising ball for the new Knick.

167
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,626
So, at least, I'll be back
at my old stomping grounds.

168
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,298
Why are these charts different?

169
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,801
It's a new system.

170
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,844
It's confusing.

171
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,972
It's easier to read for most people.

172
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,975
Even an orderly can be aware
of a patient's condition.

173
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,978
I agree with Gallinger. What is that, Latin?

174
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:16,151
Mr. Watt here suffered
from a severe ear infection.

175
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,362
The build-up of fluid

176
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,614
eventually caused his eardrum to burst.

177
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,700
In order to restore his hearing
and relieve his pain,

178
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,537
he's been scheduled
for a tympanoplasty tomorrow.

179
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,415
Well, you're familiar with the procedure.

180
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,083
You perform it.

181
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,085
Actually,

182
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,257
I think Dr. Gallinger
would be a better choice.

183
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,927
It's time I begin relinquishing patients.

184
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,971
Dr. Gallinger's been out
of the operating room for a while.

185
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:48,016
This would be a good procedure
on which to resharpen his skills.

186
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,768
Very well.

187
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,478
Gallinger, he's your patient.

188
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,690
I assure you, my skills haven't dulled,

189
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,109
but I'll take him.

190
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,069
You all right, Edwards?

191
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,323
Just surprised to see you back.

192
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,325
I wasn't expecting it.

193
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,494
I'm sure you weren't.

194
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,622
Well, now that I'm back,
let's put things right again.

195
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,125
You can start by rewriting
all of these charts

196
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,793
the correct way.

197
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:18,297
The orderlies don't need
to be aware of the patient's condition,

198
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,590
but I do.

199
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,721
It's had a few mechanical
difficulties, I'll admit,

200
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,140
but we're talking about
a very sophisticated invention.

201
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,560
Yes, if it was any more sophisticated,
it would never have run at all.

202
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,145
I paid you for a working ambulance

203
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,938
and now we're back
to using the damn horses.

204
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,398
It's temporary.

205
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,066
She's with a mechanic right now.

206
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,902
I'm going down this afternoon to collect her.

207
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,070
She'll be right as rain and better than new.

208
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,449
Fine, but any more problems
and I will terminate this arrangement.

209
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,993
Now, on the subject of our arrangement.

210
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,162
I know it's a few more weeks
until the next payment...

211
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,747
...but I was hoping you'd be white enough

212
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,998
to advance me the money today.

213
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,750
Pay the mechanic's bill and all.

214
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,668
- No.
- Oh, for fuck's sake, Barrow.

215
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,171
The sooner I get my money,
the sooner you get your cake.

216
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,089
I will happily wait.

217
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,643
Oh, dear God.

218
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,155
Nurse Elkins.

219
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,783
I need your assistance.

220
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,702
What with?

221
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:35,874
Something that further relies
on your talent for discretion

222
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,293
and your stomach for the less savory.

223
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:56,061
Hello, everyone.

224
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,567
Hello, my dear.

225
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,902
You're looking very beautiful.

226
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,907
What's he doing here?

227
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,867
You know him?

228
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,288
Of course. Through your

229
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,874
association with Dr. Thackery.

230
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,045
But we have our own relationship, don't we?

231
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,341
Uh, Nurse Elkins,
we are starting a new

232
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,094
philanthropic endeavor here at the hospital.

233
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:33,890
These unfortunate women are
in need of regular medical attention.

234
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,102
And as a service to the community,

235
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,521
we are going to provide it to them.

236
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,107
I take it we won't be registering
any of these patients.

237
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,735
As I said, your talent
for discretion will come in handy.

238
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,529
Now, should anything
need further examination,

239
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,115
it should be brought to my attention

240
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:54,828
and I will...
Somehow, find a doctor to take over.

241
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,539
Right down this hall. Thank you.

242
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,375
Ah! There you are, Herman.
They said you'd come down this way.

243
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:01,960
- Oh, my.
- Dr. Mays.

244
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:06,840
I was just explaining a new...

245
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,509
Philanthropic...

246
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,136
They're pathetic creatures.

247
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,680
And you're helping these poor girls?

248
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:14,806
We are.

249
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,310
Terribly sad situation.

250
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,480
But Nurse Elkins
has everything under control.

251
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,190
Well, perhaps I could lend a hand.

252
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:26,026
I... I cared for a great number
of women in my practice.

253
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,444
Of course, none as lovely as these.

254
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,322
We're really just organizing it now.

255
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,740
Uh, who's first?

256
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,784
Uh, how about you?

257
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,994
Forgive me, my hands are cold,

258
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,622
but my heart is yours. Hmm?

259
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,166
Hop up on the table, dear.

260
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,879
I think we have everything under control.

261
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,256
And, uh, they need their privacy.

262
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,300
Don't we all.

263
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,102
What are those?

264
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,937
So she can put her legs up.

265
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,315
Oh, ridiculous.
She can just rest them over my shoulders.

266
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,610
- I'll get some swabs for you.
- That's not necessary.

267
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,320
- Then how will you culture them?
- Ah.

268
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,780
A good nose and a pair of eyes

269
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,949
are all a doctor needs
to know what he's dealing with.

270
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:18,078
Now, let's, uh,
get that coat off, shall we?

271
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,043
So what do we do now?

272
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,883
You can't believe he's competent
after everything you've heard.

273
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,635
How could he be?

274
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,890
He'll just tear down anything
you've built here.

275
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,476
The madness, the inefficiency,

276
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:45,021
his circus tent, it will
all come roaring back.

277
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,982
And Gallinger with it.

278
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,736
I'm so glad
that you've decided to join us.

279
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,447
Having a Showalter among us will do wonders

280
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,240
for bringing the other ladies along.

281
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,576
Most of them haven't had the benefit
of being raised

282
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,078
in an atmosphere of refinement
like you and I.

283
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,707
Well, everyone seems to be
very enthusiastic, Mrs. Barrow.

284
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,084
Well, they understand
how important our work is.

285
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,503
Vitally. Bertie. Excuse me.

286
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,338
It's good to see you.

287
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,673
I had heard you returned to New York.

288
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,759
My ears were ringing. Who told you?

289
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,552
Dr. Edwards.

290
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,304
I've missed this place terribly.

291
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,097
Well, then you're back
in an employment capacity?

292
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:21,266
No, only to plan a party,

293
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,519
but at least it keeps me
close to the excitement.

294
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,565
I assumed you were back
because of Inspector Speight.

295
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,359
I recall you and he were close
when you worked together.

296
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,528
What are you talking about?

297
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:39,242
He was found washed up dead
on the banks of the East River.

298
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,286
Oh, my God. When?

299
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,038
Just a few days ago.

300
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,401
Bertie the Wise.

301
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,737
It's good to see you again.

302
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,907
I'm just, uh, trying to set things up.

303
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,910
You've been briefed on
my new line of research?

304
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:26,498
- I hope you're up for another long...
- I've come to tender my resignation.

305
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,254
Look, I know you and I had a rough go
at the end there,

306
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,840
but there's no need to make
an abrupt decision now.

307
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,762
This is actually the least abrupt way
I can do this.

308
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,349
Look, I was impaired.

309
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:49,187
You know, the drugs made me do things
I would never have done otherwise.

310
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,858
And I believe they made you
more your true self.

311
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,151
You sound like your father talking.

312
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,489
I'm not sure if you're aware,

313
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,367
but I actually loved her.

314
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,327
And she's free of me.

315
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,497
You know, the circle of people
who know about our past is miniscule.

316
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,125
- If you can see beyond it...
- You are no more sane than before.

317
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:14,546
Don't get confused by some puritanical
notion of womanhood.

318
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,174
You know, virginity is a man's
idea meant to shame.

319
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,636
Regardless of what she's done with me,

320
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:25,098
she's no less pure than she was
the day she got here.

321
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,978
She's now less pure than when
I walked into this room.

322
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,983
You didn't know?

323
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:41,114
I suppose the circle was even more
miniscule than you realized.

324
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,789
This wood here very, very strong.

325
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,499
But is it the best?

326
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:55,128
The best? Oof.
There's better, but very expensive.

327
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,422
The hospital wants only the best.

328
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:01,384
Wood that is as strong as the steel,
we'll use for the structure.

329
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,303
It's farther away from Catskills.

330
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,347
Have to have more men, more horse.

331
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:09,267
This wood almost good.
Many, many buildings use.

332
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:13,355
I am not interested in a bargain,
Mr. Karwoski.

333
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,859
How do I make this plain enough
for you? Um...

334
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,781
- You bring us the most expensive wood...
- Mmm.

335
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,575
...and then you get to bill us for more.

336
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,744
- Oh.
- Yes.

337
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,205
Because this hospital will be here long time.

338
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,374
No. Uh...

339
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:37,295
Because I only get the one chance
to skim off the building of it.

340
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,465
So I am still giving you back 20%?

341
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,969
Yes, yes, but you profit more in the end.

342
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,471
And, so do I. You see?

343
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,307
- I think so. Yes.
- Good. Good.

344
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:53,061
I throw in nails for free
because you are premium customer.

345
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:54,729
No.

346
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,774
You charge us for those, too.

347
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,235
You charge us for everything.

348
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,071
All right?

349
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,948
- Yes.
- Good.

350
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,574
Good.

351
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,411
Oh, Polacks.

352
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:11,913
Your prayers
have been answered, Harry.

353
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,458
Mr. Whitting is the finest lawyer
in the whole city.

354
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,293
Maybe even the whole country.

355
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:20,630
He's got one of them grand offices
down on Broad Street.

356
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:23,091
- Went to Harvard.
- Hello, Sister.

357
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:27,470
- I'm a sister no more.
- You will be in court. I'll make sure of it.

358
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,264
What'd I tell you?

359
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,851
So, I'll get 15 years instead of 20.

360
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,603
What are you being so negative for?

361
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,188
Tell him what he don't know.

362
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,984
The law states that any person
who willfully produces a miscarriage

363
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,361
shall be punished by imprisonment
in a state prison

364
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:46,406
for a term not less than four years
or more than 20 years.

365
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,867
But what kind of bastard judge
would do that to a nun?

366
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,952
They'd do it to a nun
that done what I'd done.

367
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,912
And with all the hoopla this case will bring,

368
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,497
there's going to be
pressure to make it heard.

369
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:55,999
Don't be bringing her down.

370
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,042
I thought you said she had a chance.

371
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,752
The fuck did I bring you
all the way out here for?

372
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,504
- Cleary, let the man speak.
- Well, she does have a chance.

373
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,965
I mean, your work with the orphanage
and the poor will help.

374
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,384
Although, any mention of your
involvement with children

375
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,636
will remind people of the ones you aborted.

376
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,346
Tell her about them loopholes.

377
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:12,223
'Cause you didn't even do the fix on the girl

378
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,433
since she was a fake for the coppers, right?

379
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,893
Not even pregnant. Tell her.

380
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:18,188
I'm also looking into any possible loopholes

381
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,898
in the way the laws are written.

382
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,900
'Cause I asked how can you be arrested

383
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,986
for doing an abortion you didn't do
on a girl who wasn't with child.

384
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,946
Got him thinking about them loopholes.

385
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,532
Well, it's not unusual for cops
working with Mr. Comstock

386
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,409
to set traps such as the one that snared you.

387
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,661
Mr. Comstock's a pain in my arse.

388
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:37,165
Well, his Society for the Suppression of Vice
does keep me in business,

389
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,793
but those arrests rarely end in a conviction.

390
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,420
So, I've asked the judge
to schedule an immediate hearing

391
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,924
to decide if the case should be
dismissed before ever going to trial.

392
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:49,969
See? Me and him, we're gonna have you
out of here in no time.

393
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:53,014
Now, I just need to get some information.

394
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:57,310
The charges against you were filed
under the name Rose Dolan.

395
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,605
- Is that your full name?
- Rose Agnes Dolan, yes.

396
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,191
Rose? Where'd that come from?

397
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,276
It's my birth name.

398
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,987
- Harriet was what I took after my vows.
- Ah.

399
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,825
Harry's better. You're no Rose.

400
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,246
Thanks for the compliment.

401
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,793
So you think you'll have everything ready
by the first hearing, then?

402
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,378
I believe so.

403
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:26,297
But there's still the matter
of my fees and expenses.

404
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,508
My office has yet to receive
any money from you.

405
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:32,053
I've had a slight delay in getting them,

406
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,306
but I'll have them by the end of the week.

407
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,851
- Don't you worry.
- All right.

408
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,687
Full steam ahead.

409
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:50,071
Cold. It must have killed the battery.

410
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,784
Not to worry.
I'll hail you a carriage.

411
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,672
I'm Detective Satterlee.

412
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,507
You the lady asking
about the health inspector?

413
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:12,051
Speight, yes. I'm Cornelia Showalter.

414
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:15,722
I worked with him at the Knick
chasing a Typhoid epidemic.

415
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:18,266
- Why don't we sit down?
- Thank you.

416
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,477
What do you want to know?

417
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:25,481
Just what you found out so far.

418
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,526
Well, not much to tell.

419
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:33,823
He was seen leaving
a saloon on Water Street.

420
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,576
He got on a late ferry home to Brooklyn.

421
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,662
Looks like he must have fell off and drowned.

422
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,331
Surprised he washed up.

423
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:44,959
Usually the current takes them out to sea
and we never find them.

424
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,295
Did anyone see him fall in?

425
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,882
No one sounded for overboard.

426
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,718
But drunks slip in quieter than you think.

427
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,387
Can't even hear the splash
over the steam engine.

428
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,223
We get one like this every week or two.

429
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:01,643
What was it you
wanted to talk to me about, Mrs. Showalter?

430
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,311
Stop that.

431
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,980
Cornelia.

432
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,902
I... I had a medical question.

433
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,406
Is it possible to detect alcohol

434
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,242
in the body of a person,

435
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,202
specifically a dead one?

436
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,205
Why do you ask?

437
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:25,458
I'm sure you've heard
about Inspector Speight.

438
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:27,752
Yes. Tragic.

439
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,672
And also a bit mysterious.

440
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,883
I just spoke to the detective
in charge of the case.

441
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:37,095
- Cornelia.
- And he told me Speight was terribly drunk

442
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,013
when he fell off the ferry and died.

443
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,890
Is this really your business?

444
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,184
But Speight didn't drink.

445
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,812
Never has. Not a drop.

446
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,732
You're certain about this?

447
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,443
Dealing with drunks in flophouses

448
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,779
made him a strong believer in temperance.

449
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,197
Zealous, really.

450
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,242
A lot of men have been known
to lose their resolve

451
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,411
and bend an elbow at a bar.

452
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,456
It would certainly explain
his inability to hold his liquor.

453
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,958
Not Speight.

454
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,796
It's very strange and no one's giving it
a second look.

455
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:16,551
I'm guessing you haven't
spoken to Phillip about this.

456
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,053
No.

457
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,557
I know I shouldn't get involved.

458
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,103
I could probably devise a test.

459
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,564
But you would have to get
to his body before it decomposes,

460
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,316
which will happen much faster than usual

461
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,109
since it was found in water.

462
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,737
Also, he's already been buried.

463
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:42,910
Well, getting his body out of the ground,
I'm afraid, is beyond my skills.

464
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:56,382
What the hell are you doing out there, Otto?

465
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:59,761
You're moving around like
you're trying not to let a shit pop out.

466
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,054
Sorry, Mr. Cleary.

467
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,848
I saw you beat this slug three weeks ago.

468
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,392
Pinned him faster than he did you.

469
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,269
That match was fixed.

470
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,733
What was that, fella?

471
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,110
It was fixed. I went limp.

472
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:19,238
That's a load of shite.
He pinned you like an old biddy.

473
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,240
Only because I let him.

474
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,409
I didn't know nothing about it.

475
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,828
All right, who fixed it?

476
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,373
His old manager.

477
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,459
Wanted to unload this chump
on some dumb sap.

478
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,461
I guess that was you.

479
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:42,387
You can have the dollar I made tonight.

480
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,764
What's that supposed to buy me?

481
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,181
Another.

482
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:19,484
Do you like this song?

483
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,486
I can't say I know it.

484
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,530
It's called When We Were Married.
Pretty, isn't it?

485
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,699
You want to get married already?

486
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,367
We only just met.

487
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:31,037
Well, a girl can pretend, can't she?

488
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:34,040
- Oh, I'll gladly take pretend tonight.
- Mmm.

489
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,376
- What's your name?
- Cate.

490
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,378
Hello, Cate.

491
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,214
I'm John.

492
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,758
John, would you like to dance with me?

493
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:48,262
No, I would not like to dance with you.

494
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:07,198
Don't miss a button.
Wouldn't want the wife to get wise.

495
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,033
I don't have a wife.

496
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:10,493
Oh.

497
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:13,204
Maybe I can come see you
at your place next time.

498
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,956
A little cleaner.

499
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,166
I don't want it cleaner.

500
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,794
People in California
are Americans just like us,

501
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,879
but may as well be on the moon

502
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,881
for all they care about
what's going on in New York.

503
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:27,093
It's true. No one there has even
heard of the Schermerhorns

504
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:29,512
or the Robertsons or the Showalters.

505
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,889
Then how does anyone
know who's important?

506
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:34,809
It's usually the man with the biggest gun.

507
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,144
Sounds awful.

508
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,189
No way to know if someone's
a person of quality.

509
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:42,400
Who'd want to live in a place like that?

510
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:43,818
I agree.

511
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:49,490
You must have noblemen and women

512
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,158
to show the people how to be.

513
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,911
To give them someone to admire.

514
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:56,956
That's why Hungary leads the world
in so many ways.

515
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,042
Oh, yes, we all want to be Hungarian.

516
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:03,087
Tibor and Gwynnie will be
gone for several months.

517
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,173
Cornelia, you and Phillip
will have a lot more room

518
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,467
in our house to move around.

519
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,970
I assumed our apartment
would be finished by then

520
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,263
and we'd have already moved out.

521
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:13,681
Of course it will.

522
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,392
I meant in the off chance it wasn't.

523
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,185
With all the construction in New York,

524
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,396
I barely know when the men will show up

525
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,274
and half the time the workers muck it up.

526
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:26,193
Seems your father's kidnapped

527
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,030
all the best labor for the new hospital.

528
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:32,867
Well, building the new Knick...

529
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,619
It's going to take some doing.

530
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:38,372
I mean, competition for competent crews
is fierce.

531
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:41,167
We'll just have to dig deeper.

532
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,543
I'd rather you didn't.

533
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,086
I'm not concerned.

534
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,796
You should be. Mmm.

535
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,427
Charity is all well and good,

536
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,638
and you know I believe in it as much as you,

537
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,766
but we need to find other donors
to lessen our share.

538
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,434
I gave.

539
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,353
And I told you, you didn't need to.

540
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:01,812
I'm more than happy to cover the cost.

541
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:05,232
I'm just doing
what those Californians are doing,

542
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,817
looking ahead.

543
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,237
We could use that money to diversify.

544
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,698
H. H. Prettyman is bidding
to build the new subway

545
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,241
and there's still a position available

546
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,826
for another partner in the venture.

547
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:19,288
Burrowing your way through dirt
and rock like a gopher

548
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:22,625
to build a train no one in their right
mind would dare ride?

549
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,169
- It's dangerous business.
- It's the future.

550
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,004
It's a disaster in the making.

551
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:30,466
Now, you heard Hobart.
Half those crews are a menace.

552
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:32,677
Now you want them blasting their way

553
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,970
beneath this city with dynamite?

554
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,598
Twenty-five years ago
you would have jumped at this.

555
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,309
And 25 years ago

556
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:42,895
you were in diapers.

557
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:46,607
So, I'll thank you to know your place, son.

558
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:51,445
I wish I had your troubles.

559
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,283
The city makes us take in
every Negro psychopathic patient

560
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,994
and then gives us nothing in return.

561
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,872
We're lucky we have enough medicine
to get us through the week.

562
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,792
Anesthesia, that's a luxury.

563
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:09,213
Well, we may have more resources
at the Knick,

564
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,799
but they don't make it easy.

565
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,846
They expect me to thank them
on a daily basis

566
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:20,099
for the gifts that they believe
they've given me.

567
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,769
Did you read the article
in the paper last week

568
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:26,188
about the cyclist, Major Taylor?

569
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,357
No, get to the point.

570
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,151
You remember?

571
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:31,986
The man goes over to Europe

572
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,239
and is treated like the King of England.

573
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,741
Stays in the best hotels.

574
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:39,076
Breaks every possible record.

575
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,580
He returns home, makes no difference.

576
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,126
He's just a nigger on a bike.

577
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,221
There's some people I'd like for you to meet.

578
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,960
Daddy.

579
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,629
Hello, Cricket.

580
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,094
You stopped writing.

581
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,138
Your mama and me was worried about you.

582
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:42,807
I'm fine, Daddy.

583
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,975
Didn't have to leave
everyone back home for me.

584
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,310
I may not have wanted you up here,

585
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,563
but if you are,
I'm gonna make sure you're right.

586
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,233
Everybody's soul needs protecting.

587
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,527
Besides, I'm sure I'll find
myself plenty of folks

588
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:57,530
in need of the Lord's good word
in a place like this.

589
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:00,241
Probably just in this building alone.

590
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:03,410
Let me show you around. Come on.

591
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,469
This is where we perform all of our surgeries.

592
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,265
I think it's a special place.

593
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,227
You wouldn't believe what happens here.

594
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:32,189
Don't you let yourself get too impressed
by anything a man can do.

595
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:37,653
Or build like that Grand Central Depot
I came into.

596
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:41,282
I'm only interested
in the miracles God can create.

597
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,244
The things we can do,

598
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,789
I think they might impress even you.

599
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,281
Citrate of caffeine is for?

600
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,074
Mitigation of symptoms.

601
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,493
- Ox gall?
- Indigestion.

602
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,246
What the hell is this Dr. Mays doing here?

603
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:32,416
- Get rid of him.
- No, you barely know the man.

604
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,418
I know enough to know
that I'd rather have you

605
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,712
operating on me with a spoon.

606
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,591
Everyone deserves a chance
to prove themselves.

607
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,468
Don't you agree?

608
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,017
Nurse Elkins.

609
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,061
Good morning, Doctor.

610
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:56,315
Daddy, this is the chief of surgery,

611
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,608
Dr. John Thackery.

612
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,860
- A.D. Elkins.
- Honor to meet you.

613
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:02,071
You're a preacher, correct?
Should I call you...

614
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,906
Oh, I don't go in for any of that.

615
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,866
I'm here to serve Him, not myself.

616
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:09,745
Well, it seems you've, uh, passed
that along to your daughter.

617
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,040
No one gives as much
to the patients as she does.

618
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:17,211
She's seen a lot since she started here.

619
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,049
And, uh, she's proven herself
the best of all of us.

620
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,386
Raise them up right
and they'll always find their way.

621
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,347
Amen.

622
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,988
What is this?

623
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,698
A fever cabinet.

624
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,200
Where did it come from?

625
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,036
Dr. Edwards had it installed last month.

626
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,725
Edwards, can I get an explanation
on this fever cabinet?

627
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,351
Is something wrong with your eye?

628
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:16,979
Uh, it's just a scratched cornea.

629
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,106
Is that why you passed on that surgery?

630
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,816
No, it's nothing.

631
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,027
What did you want to know?

632
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,611
Fever cabinet.

633
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,615
Yes, the patient is suffering
from Bright's disease.

634
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,869
By inducing fever, I've seen a decrease
in the albumin levels in his urine.

635
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,705
That's an expensive toy for one disease.

636
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,373
Fever therapy has a number of uses.

637
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:39,126
- I thought it a worthy investment.
- I don't believe you.

638
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,922
I can show you the papers.
Can you read German?

639
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:45,883
Not about the cabinet.

640
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,428
You passed on that eardrum repair
and gave it to Gallinger.

641
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,723
- Because I wanted to give him...
- I know, help him resharpen his skills.

642
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,141
What is it?

643
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:57,811
What's going on?

644
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,204
It's my eye.

645
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:19,750
So, the puzzle is figuring out
how to get the subretinal fluid to drain

646
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:23,504
so that, hopefully, when the retina
comes in contact with the choroid,

647
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:26,381
it will reattach and resume normal function.

648
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,342
Have you tried, uh, applying any medications

649
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,635
that might absorb the fluid?

650
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,929
Salicylate of sodium, mercurial inunctions,

651
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,931
even laxatives, all useless.

652
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:37,017
The one treatment that seems
to show some promise

653
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,937
is coagulation by electrolysis.

654
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,731
I've been experimenting on rabbits.

655
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:43,857
And?

656
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,403
Good enough that I'm willing
to try it on myself.

657
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:50,948
Good enough? Is that the standard?

658
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,158
- To be blind...
- Don't.

659
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,623
You have anyone to perform it?

660
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:03,710
I was hoping you might help me with that.

661
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,429
You're the only one I can trust.

662
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:19,810
Please, John.

663
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:27,818
Well, then, we have to do it at night
when the hospital is empty.

664
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:30,404
You don't need anyone to know.

665
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:34,324
I got fairly good at secret surgery down
in the sub-basement.

666
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,119
I've had some recent experience

667
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,788
in clandestine procedures myself.

668
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,260
I asked the police
about exhuming the body,

669
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,721
but they said Inspector Speight's case
was closed

670
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:57,347
and they could be of no help.

671
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:58,891
That's because they're too busy

672
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,727
harassing the good men here at Tammany.

673
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,979
They're not interested in the law.

674
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,441
Clever man, though, Teddy,
I'll give him that.

675
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,027
He just dangles police commissioner

676
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,155
in front of Devery and that jackass just...

677
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,948
And we're corrupt.

678
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:18,368
Well, it sounds difficult.

679
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,955
Will you consider an exhumation?

680
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:25,959
See that bulldog, Mrs. Showalter?

681
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,963
A gift, $5,000.

682
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,716
Ten times a cop's annual salary.

683
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,219
Now, who would pay that for this?

684
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,970
I'll tell you.

685
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:41,850
The people who are making sure
Speight's body stays in the ground.

686
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,354
Who would ask you to do that?

687
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,317
Unless you can buy me a better dog,

688
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,319
I'm afraid our business here is done.

689
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,787
Excuse me, miss.

690
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,919
I'm just saying they got reason
to keep you at the uptown Knick.

691
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,963
This is your truck. What do I got?

692
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:12,839
I ain't gonna be fancy enough for that place.

693
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,050
You want to secure
your employment?

694
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,261
Learn a thing or two about fixing
a fucking suspension.

695
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,846
- That's what I'm doing.
- Mr. Cleary?

696
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:22,516
Miss Robertson.

697
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:26,436
It's Mrs. Showalter now.

698
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:28,939
Ah. Right.

699
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,858
How's holy matrimony treating you?

700
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,027
Fine.

701
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:37,864
I was wondering if you could
help me with something.

702
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:47,332
I never pictured you
for a repeating customer.

703
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,376
But I'm out of that game
since Harry got nabbed.

704
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,378
- That's not...
- I got the name

705
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,089
of an old Bulgarian lady
who does them down Clinton Street.

706
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,174
But from what I've heard,
you'd be safer falling off a horse.

707
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:57,968
That's not why I'm here.

708
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:01,388
Harry told me you used to dig graves
at Potter's field.

709
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,975
- She talked to you about me?
- Mmm-hmm.

710
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,480
Yeah, I used to work the shovel there
a few years back.

711
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,691
You still own that shovel?

712
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,243
Are you sure the guard won't say anything?

713
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:24,953
Ah, those two bottles of whiskey I gave him

714
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:29,082
are the only things he'll be talking to
for the next couple hours.

715
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,047
What's so funny?

716
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,049
Over the years...

717
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,344
I committed a petty crime here or there.

718
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,471
It's how a man survives in this city.

719
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:46,099
But the two who drag me
into serious malfeasance

720
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:49,686
are a society lady and a fucking nun.

721
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:57,527
How is Harry doing?

722
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,116
You ever been inside of a jailhouse?

723
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:08,121
Well, it ain't exactly the Waldorf.

724
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,084
After a while, those walls,

725
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:14,711
they start whispering at you,

726
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:17,631
telling you, you ain't never gonna get out.

727
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,843
I've known a few tough lads

728
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:25,806
turn to jelly after a while
in a place like that.

729
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:30,143
Now, Harry, she's tougher than all of them.

730
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:32,437
But not for much longer.

731
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,065
She's starting to go.

732
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,608
She's lucky to have you.

733
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,902
She needs more than me, miss.

734
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,571
What can I do?

735
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:45,909
Well, I did get her one of them
good old lawyers.

736
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,036
Upper-class, like you.

737
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,499
Problem is, can't afford him.

738
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,002
But you can.

739
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:00,590
- I can't ask my family...
- You have a boat

740
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,427
in every port from here to Persia.

741
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,930
You must have something set aside.

742
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:10,934
- Especially after what she did for you.
- I'll do everything I can.

743
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,895
All right. Oh.

744
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:15,897
Oh.

745
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,318
There's our man.

746
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,084
Will you look at that.

747
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:38,503
Your Mr. Speight went and fucked away off.

748
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:44,342
New York.

749
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,095
Sure is a busy place.

750
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,807
Can't go a step without winding up
shoulder to shoulder

751
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:53,143
with white folks, Negro,

752
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:57,481
Christian, Hebrew, Italian, Greek,

753
00:46:57,565 --> 00:47:01,026
Siamese, Japanese,
and everything in between.

754
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:04,279
All the corners of the Earth thrown together

755
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:08,074
with strange tongues from Babel.

756
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,243
Strange clothes.

757
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,662
Even stranger beliefs.

758
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,331
Why, just today,

759
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,167
I met a man

760
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,127
called himself a Sikh.

761
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:23,340
Carried a sword on his hip

762
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:25,759
longer than a cavalryman's.

763
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,011
I don't know what he was seeking,
but when he finds it,

764
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,263
he's gonna have a whopper
of a weapon to handle it.

765
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,644
I never met

766
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:38,563
no one like that.

767
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:44,110
And maybe before he come here to New York,

768
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:46,363
he never met no one like me.

769
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:50,492
Or you.

770
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,247
But you and I

771
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,751
do share one thing with him and everyone,

772
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:04,256
one language we all understand
and answer to.

773
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,716
And that's the language of God.

774
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,094
- Amen.
- Amen.

775
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:10,595
God,

776
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:13,098
and His infinite wisdom.

777
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,724
Hallelujah.

778
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,144
The same God

779
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:22,440
that shines inside our bodies,

780
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:28,405
shines in the darkest jungles of Africa.

781
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:31,408
Praise the Lord.

782
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:37,414
The same spirit that rose Jesus

783
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,541
up from the grave

784
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:41,751
is the same spirit

785
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:45,380
that built the Himalayan mountains of Asia.

786
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,007
Glory to God.

787
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:54,264
The same God that spoke to Moses

788
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:58,184
is the same God that speaks to us

789
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:02,480
as He is speaking through me right now.

790
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:19,789
Let us sing for all of those who cannot
sing the word of God.

791
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,627
Shall we gather at the river

792
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:27,380
Where bright angels' feet have trod

793
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,800
With its crystal tide forever

794
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:34,929
Flowing by the throne of God

795
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,733
- How does that feel?
- Fine.

796
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,235
I need the local anesthetic.

797
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,987
Nurse Pell.

798
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:17,490
A hypodermic of four percent
cocaine solution.

799
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:18,992
Yes, Doctor.

800
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:34,299
Look up.

801
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,526
Is it numbing?

802
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,653
It's begun to.

803
00:51:57,698 --> 00:52:00,450
You need to make a two
to three-millimeter incision

804
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,577
on the upper portion of the sclera.

805
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:04,412
Once you've made the incision,

806
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:06,790
twist the blade,
which will release the subretinal fluid.

807
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:08,374
Surgical knife.

808
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:33,441
What was that?

809
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,071
Something wrong?

810
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:41,241
No. No, it's fine.

811
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,121
Dr. Thackery, if you're
not feeling up to this...

812
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:49,415
No, you need this done.

813
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:54,504
Stop.

814
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,631
Dr. Thackery.

815
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,007
Stop, Dr. Thackery.

816
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,051
God damn it.

817
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:21,114
John.

818
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,366
Cate.

819
00:53:24,285 --> 00:53:26,786
So are we not dancing again tonight?

820
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,585
One for me?

821
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,005
Dan.

822
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:46,890
To your health.

823
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,436
Heroin?

824
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,813
In this arm.

825
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:55,940
This one's for cocaine.

826
00:53:56,775 --> 00:54:00,069
- You inject both at the same time?
- Mmm-hmm.

827
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,655
The cocaine takes the bottom off the heroin

828
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,742
and the heroin takes the top off the cocaine.

829
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:10,246
Now, they dance beautifully together.

830
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:13,082
Until the cocaine wears off.

831
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:15,627
That's when you find out
if you got the amounts wrong.

832
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,962
And if you do, it'll kill you.

833
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:20,089
But get it right...
