2
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,791
Lottie.

3
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:45,753
Lottie.

4
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,053
"Dearest John,

5
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,599
"I don't even know
if you're getting these letters.

6
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,560
"I hope so.

7
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,982
"I hate to think of you in that place alone.

8
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,860
"I wish they'd let me visit.

9
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,864
"Life just goes on,

10
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,408
"but not for me.

11
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,077
"Not without you.

12
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,997
"The days are so long.

13
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,212
"I haven't seen Sister Harriet yet,

14
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:31,340
"but Mr. Cleary says
she seems to be bearing up.

15
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,468
"I don't know when the trial is.

16
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,054
"The groundbreaking
for the new hospital is next week,

17
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:39,932
"so Mr. Barrow has been
walking around like a peacock.

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,983
"I assisted in a previa surgery the other
day with Bertie and Dr. Edwards.

19
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,068
"It's hard with Bertie.

20
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,904
"He's still mad.

21
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:58,576
"They lifted Dr. Gallinger's suspension,
but he still hasn't returned to work.

22
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,211
"That's all I have for now.

23
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,797
"Please, write if you can.

24
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,341
"I miss you terribly and want so much

25
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,176
"to know how you are.

26
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,347
"I wish I could see you, my love.

27
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,352
"Yours, Lucy."

28
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:18,549
And if you want, I could, uh, tattoo her lips

29
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,885
to make them appear more plump.

30
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,347
I'll only charge you four vials.

31
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,098
No, thank you.

32
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,975
Well, two, then.

33
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,741
- Mrs. Showalter.
- There you are.

34
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,452
- Any luck with the mayor's office?
- No.

35
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,538
They're more afraid of the news
spreading than the disease.

36
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,166
Any more cases?

37
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,670
Not in the last five days.
Those first cases were the only ones.

38
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:59,340
- Is any food getting in at all?
- Nothing. They won't let anything in.

39
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,468
I'll try and get the health department
to speak to the police chief.

40
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,512
Miss, I told you not to get close.

41
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,180
There's sickness in there.

42
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,058
Plague is carried by rodents and fleas.

43
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:12,353
You think your wooden
barriers are keeping them inside?

44
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,106
Dr. Feng just said there are no new cases.

45
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,149
There's no need for the quarantine.

46
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,611
Mayor Phelan says them
coolies got it, and I trust the mayor.

47
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,719
Mother Superior.

48
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:47,930
My child.

49
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,518
Did you come all the way
from Ohio to see me?

50
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,145
I wanted to.

51
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,232
I brought something.

52
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,406
It's what you gave me
your third year at the convent

53
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,243
on the date of our Virgin Mother's birth.

54
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,873
The day that you committed yourself to God.

55
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,834
And I always carry it with me when I travel.

56
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,921
I was so proud of you, how far you'd come

57
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,841
since that little Irish girl

58
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,302
abandoned by her mother on the train west.

59
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,637
You saved my life.

60
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,639
You brightened ours.

61
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,309
Brave, tenacious, spirited.

62
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,145
A heart as big as the moon.

63
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,106
Lost and then found.

64
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,320
Is it true?

65
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,745
I... I could say that God
sent an angel down to instruct me

66
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,040
or there was something divine about it,

67
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,168
but there wasn't.

68
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,338
The women just needed help

69
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,799
and I helped them.

70
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,802
So it's true.

71
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,763
I am what they say I am.

72
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,938
Then what you are is a devil on Earth.

73
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,067
A murderer of innocents.

74
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,530
You have disgraced me,

75
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,782
the sisters who loved you,

76
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,701
the convent that saved you,

77
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,245
the nurses who taught you,

78
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,163
the Catholics who nurtured you,

79
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,624
and the God who loved you.

80
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,967
This is all that's left of you in my heart.

81
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,348
I should have let you die.

82
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,733
Hmm.

83
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:11,282
There are some
straw-colored striae that are visible.

84
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,619
How's the peripheral vision?

85
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,581
Some issues.

86
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,959
Put this over your right eye.

87
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,550
And how do these appear to you?

88
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,886
Wavy on the left.

89
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,222
And a bit better on the right.

90
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,517
Have you had any blows to that eye recently?

91
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:40,936
Yes.

92
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,981
Well, those blows detached your retina.

93
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,692
Seems to have almost completely separated

94
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,694
from the rear wall of your left eye.

95
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,196
And the treatment?

96
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,531
Not much to recommend.

97
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,201
Uh, rest in a recumbent position
for several weeks

98
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,952
may bring some relief.

99
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,330
So, it could heal on its own?

100
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,666
Or get worse. There's no way of knowing.

101
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,086
And any further blows
could prove catastrophic.

102
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,465
Are there any other procedures?

103
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,009
Experimental?

104
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,639
They're all unproven and much too risky.

105
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,026
What about this one, Everett?

106
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,112
Looks to be about
the right shape and color.

107
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,489
Dorothy?

108
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,412
You have a wonderful eye, love.

109
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,581
You're certainly lucky
to have a sister

110
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,417
with such a wonderful set of teeth herself.

111
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,462
How long are you visiting from Philadelphia?

112
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,297
As long as she needs me.

113
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,758
Dorothy has been a godsend

114
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:57,137
ever since I pulled Eleanor out of
Dr. Cotton's abysmal madhouse.

115
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,641
I often get a new batch
of teeth from the morgue

116
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,477
on Thursdays if you'd like me to return then.

117
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,646
No, I want to finish now.

118
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,322
She'll do 14 miles an hour

119
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:18,534
and never need a drink
of water or a bucket of oats.

120
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,329
Uh, just plug her in and she'll do the miles.

121
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,457
I can drive her good, too.
The man who sold her to me taught me how.

122
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,210
And you say you own it? Legally?

123
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,713
Got a bill of sale and everything.

124
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,758
And you want me to pay you to drive this?

125
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,011
Ah. You put, "Knickerbocker"
up there on the side,

126
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,388
people will be making
themselves sick to take a ride in her.

127
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,515
Ah, she'll go perfect with the place uptown.

128
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,935
Show everyone that we're, uh, modern and all.

129
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,895
And what if it runs out of electricity?

130
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,982
There's places all over that'll
swap the battery off the bottom in a jiff.

131
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,568
Bolt on a full one and I'm on my way.

132
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,030
No more hooves to the head.
No more tacking up.

133
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,408
No more horse shit.

134
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,368
I doubt that.

135
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,086
I'll give you $45 a month
to cover the automobile,

136
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,297
ten of which comes back to me,

137
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,633
and you pay for all
repairs to keep it running.

138
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,928
Mr. Barrow, you just got
yourself the finest ambulance

139
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,723
in all of New York City.

140
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:24,892
Come on.

141
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,394
We are in business.

142
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,452
It's a little dark.
I'm having trouble seeing.

143
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,079
Nurse Baker, light, please.

144
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,125
Retract more, nurse.

145
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,003
What do you notice?

146
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,214
Calot's triangle.

147
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,092
There are two cystic arteries arising

148
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,427
from the hepatic instead of the usual one.

149
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,097
It occurs in about 15% of cases.

150
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,435
Nurse Baker, has our
next patient been prepped?

151
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,979
- He has.
- And the one after that? The tonsils?

152
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,315
- I'll make certain.
- Thank you.

153
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:18,570
We'll need to separate out
and ligate both arteries.

154
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,905
Hmm.

155
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,867
The inferior one is
exceptionally underdeveloped.

156
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,204
It's hard against the hepatic.

157
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,165
You do it.

158
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,167
Me?

159
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,044
You've seen it done.

160
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,338
Now, it's time you do one yourself.

161
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,258
See one, do one?

162
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,468
Teach one.

163
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,816
- Dr. Gallinger.
- Edwards.

164
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,697
Uh...

165
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,198
Tell me, how...

166
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,201
How are things at home?

167
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,959
I am ready to resume my duties.

168
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,173
I see.

169
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,511
Well, I must admit that having
a third set of experienced hands

170
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,722
would be useful in picking up the slack.

171
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,140
But know this,

172
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:32,102
you come back,

173
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,564
you come back as subordinate to me,

174
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:39,610
with the full respect
and deference that implies.

175
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,238
I think I'll come back
when the chief of surgery returns.

176
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,574
I'm acting chief now.

177
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,576
And I intend to make that permanent.

178
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,122
You think this hospital
will go along with that?

179
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,669
You're as dumb as you think I think you are.

180
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,104
Come in.

181
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,945
Nurse Elkins.

182
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,449
I miss you calling me Lucy.

183
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,744
It's your title in this institution.

184
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,539
I think a woman such as yourself
would be glad to receive

185
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,666
any sign of respect at this point.

186
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,881
You don't have to be mean.

187
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,260
It's not in your nature.

188
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,598
What do you want?

189
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,435
It's just that it's your birthday tomorrow.

190
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,939
I always like to get my presents early.

191
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,360
Makes your special day feel longer
'cause it starts the day before.

192
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,535
Aren't you gonna open it?

193
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,047
It's a caduceus.

194
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,176
It's real gold.

195
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,514
Must have cost you a lot.

196
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,310
I wanted to.

197
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,942
I can't accept this.

198
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,281
Well, I've been doing
my best on several fronts.

199
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,868
Our groundbreaking
ceremony is still on schedule

200
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,996
and will certainly attract donors' attention.

201
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,957
You've all approved the architectural plans

202
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:02,711
and I've set about hiring
the best contractors in New York.

203
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,923
Each is going through
a withering negotiation,

204
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,800
I can assure you.

205
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,260
Not a penny of your money

206
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,888
will be wasted on manpower or materials.

207
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,932
Very good. What's next?

208
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:21,063
Dr. Edwards is waiting
to give us a report on his efforts.

209
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,315
Bring him in.

210
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,074
Dr. Edwards.

211
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,209
Good day, gentlemen.

212
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,295
Algie.

213
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,463
Have a seat.

214
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,351
Despite being understaffed,

215
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,979
the surgical service has been able to average

216
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,107
over 40 surgeries per week

217
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,986
with no increase in complications
and an 18% decrease in mortality.

218
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,240
Also,

219
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:18,578
we have added several new procedures.

220
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:24,960
Four of which we have perfected ourselves.

221
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,295
When will Dr. Thackery return?

222
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,548
The news I've received
indicates that the man

223
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,925
is in no shape to return
and likely never will be.

224
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,178
He seems lost to his addiction forever.

225
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:40,308
If that ends up being the case,

226
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,149
I would like to put myself forward

227
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:51,194
as a candidate for the
permanent job as chief of surgery.

228
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,988
I'm sure you would.

229
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,826
At the very least, I think it
would be prudent to start a search.

230
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,995
For a fourth surgeon, yes.

231
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,999
No, for a man to take your job
atop the department.

232
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,837
There are the right sort of men
at several institutions around the country

233
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,006
who would make excellent candidates.

234
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,799
I know a very good junior man at Dartmouth

235
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,801
who would be eager to make a step up.

236
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:20,015
Before we go casting
about New Hampshire for new blood,

237
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,684
let's put together a set of criteria,

238
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:26,021
most of which I'm sure
Dr. Edwards already fulfills,

239
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,899
and begin a more formal process.

240
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,484
Agreed.

241
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,819
I may have a solution to the problem

242
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:35,447
of the fourth surgeon you requested.

243
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:40,368
I was recently able to lure Dr. William Mays

244
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,830
out of private practice and to our hospital.

245
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,751
In addition to being an excellent doctor,

246
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,879
he was also trained as a surgeon.

247
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,590
You hired a surgeon without consulting me?

248
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:57,219
I hired a doctor, which is my job.

249
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,096
I know Mays.
A good family and a decent sort.

250
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,933
His wife's a member of the
Women's Temperance Society.

251
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,935
An irony if there ever was one.

252
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,062
Gentlemen.

253
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,483
If I may be candid.

254
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,444
Dr. Mays is a general practitioner

255
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:17,280
and not up to the surgical
standards of this hospital.

256
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,575
He is connected to
the wealthiest people in New York.

257
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,786
I know you're hot about the meeting, Algie,

258
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,621
and I don't blame you.

259
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,833
Waiting in the hall,

260
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,419
like a child outside of
the principal's office.

261
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,840
And then for Barrow to go behind my back.

262
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,800
Do you think he ever would
have done that to Thackery?

263
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,886
You're not Thackery, for better or for worse.

264
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,808
You see Havershorn's face when you said

265
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,561
you wanted to be made permanent chief?

266
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,229
If I hadn't known better,
I would have prescribed him

267
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,815
something for impacted constipation.

268
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:04,077
Look, I know you're absolutely
qualified to be chief of surgery.

269
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,540
But you above all people
know that we have to move carefully.

270
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,835
The other board members
have neither the progressive mind

271
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,839
nor the courage to make the sort
of change that you and I want.

272
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,426
The world may not be
moving fast enough for us,

273
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,679
but it's likely moving
much too quickly for them.

274
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,056
These are not the kind of men
who like to make history.

275
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,475
They'd rather tout their
ancestors' place in it.

276
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:32,272
You might remind them
of your ancestors' place in it.

277
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,026
We'll get you what you want.

278
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,279
We're just gonna need
to bring them along slowly.

279
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,492
Then I'll trust you to do that.

280
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:02,177
Phillip, you're home so early.

281
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,929
I didn't expect you until 6:00.

282
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,181
I told you this morning
I'd be back after lunch.

283
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,516
- We have the opera tonight.
- Of course.

284
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:12,187
But I thought we could spend
some time together this afternoon.

285
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,563
Where are you going?

286
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:16,316
- I need to run an errand.
- Can it wait?

287
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,692
It can't.

288
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,362
What are you up to?

289
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,863
- Nothing.
- Mmm-hmm.

290
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,867
I'm helping a sick friend, that's all.

291
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,827
I'll be back in time to make the curtain.

292
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,135
Could be mine.

293
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:45,679
Yes, come in.

294
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,931
Here are the rest
of the patient files you asked for.

295
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,224
- Thank you.
- Anyone who was admitted

296
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,684
with bubonic plague is in that pile.

297
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,602
- Including the ones who died?
- Yes.

298
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:53,728
Thank you.

299
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,319
Let's see.

300
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,113
Italian immigrant.

301
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,990
Polish.

302
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,616
Italian.

303
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:07,701
Hungarian.

304
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,578
Are any of these patients wealthy?
Could afford private rooms?

305
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,331
Hardly.

306
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,500
Most couldn't have even paid their bills

307
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:19,170
had they not been put here by the generosity
of your department and the city.

308
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,422
Something isn't squaring.

309
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,841
If this many were here
plus a bunch over at Bellevue,

310
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,260
all recent arrivals to this country,

311
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,470
how the hell did they get
through immigration at Ellis?

312
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,850
They check them before
they let them off the island.

313
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,602
Send some back,
even hospitalize some there.

314
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,067
Will this be sufficient?

315
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:46,072
If you're asking,
that means you've got more to give.

316
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,411
There's a dozen more wagons coming.

317
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,580
Wonderful. Make it quick.

318
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,933
Don't, there's plenty
of food for everyone.

319
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,519
If you could all form a line.

320
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,354
Please, don't shove.

321
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,190
I'm Dr. Gallinger
from the Knickerbocker Hospital.

322
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,527
I'm here to see Dr. John Thackery, patient.

323
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,779
I'm sorry, we have
no patient here by that name.

324
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,280
Yes, you do.

325
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:11,324
Are you family?

326
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,992
No, a colleague.

327
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,787
I don't know under
what name he might be registered,

328
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,498
but he is here and I will see him.

329
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,291
Our patients require privacy...

330
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,919
The fella he wants
won't care a whit about that.

331
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,379
Follow me.

332
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,344
Mr. Crutchfield.

333
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,720
Is it time for my...

334
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:34,389
Everett.

335
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,349
Hello, Thack.

336
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,518
What time do you have?

337
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:39,894
Um...

338
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,731
- 10:15.
- 10:15.

339
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:47,735
10:15. You see that clock
on the wall says 10:10.

340
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,947
I am due my dose in 15 minutes, not 20.

341
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,741
You tell that Dr. Hackett that I'm on to him.

342
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,201
We all are.

343
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:59,831
They love to experiment here like we're mice.

344
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,624
But I don't need to tell you that

345
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,127
after what you went through with Eleanor.

346
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:08,798
But, uh, you don't know
how to control your environment like I do.

347
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,051
You know, I'm like all eyes and ears.

348
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,804
What time is it now?

349
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,223
A minute later.

350
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,059
You're no better than when you came here.

351
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,644
No, no, this place is good for me.

352
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,938
- Good for you?
- Yeah, they have excellent treatment here.

353
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:27,358
Excellent. They're, uh,
just a little stingy with it.

354
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:31,487
John, you are desperately
needed back at the Knick.

355
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,698
I'm not going back.

356
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,451
I'm not going back.

357
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,828
No.

358
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,872
I, I can't go back.

359
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,375
You're staying?

360
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,130
While you're here,
you could do me a great favor.

361
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:52,592
They keep all the drugs
locked in Dr. Hackett's office.

362
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,760
Okay? Pay him a visit.

363
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,929
Tell him you're there
to discuss my treatment.

364
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,556
And then grab me a couple
of vials of cocaine and heroin

365
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:01,476
and I'll meet you
at the kitchen entrance. Huh?

366
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,853
Yeah?

367
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:05,939
Agreed?

368
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,109
I'll figure something out.

369
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,616
Cornelia?

370
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,035
Cornelia, come into the parlor.

371
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,662
I have a surprise for you.

372
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,121
Just arrived from New York.

373
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,332
I'm just gonna run upstairs.

374
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,709
What happened?

375
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,089
It looks worse than it is.

376
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,007
Oh, my God. What happened?

377
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,343
Cornelia.

378
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,554
I went to Chinatown to help.

379
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:40,932
I bought them supplies.

380
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,558
I suppose I should have told you.

381
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:43,726
You suppose?

382
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,895
You could have exposed
yourself to the Black Death.

383
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,355
You suppose you should have told me?

384
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,065
What if you were pregnant?
You'd be exposing our child...

385
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,775
I'm not pregnant.

386
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,323
Where'd you get the money
for something like that?

387
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,075
Sold some things.

388
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,285
What things?

389
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,370
Some jewelry, that's all.

390
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,168
Your grandmother's earrings.

391
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,338
The sapphire ones your mother gave me.

392
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:13,589
I know they were important,

393
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,926
but when I thought
of all the good they could do...

394
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,471
Mr. Showalter.

395
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:21,848
Cornelia.

396
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,101
What... What are you doing here?

397
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,937
He took the train from
New York to surprise us.

398
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:30,106
I had some business up in Oregon.

399
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,816
Timber and salmon.

400
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,401
I thought I'd stop off.

401
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,448
I'm sorry you had to see us squabble.

402
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,450
It's my fault.

403
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:43,745
It's the fire that Phillip loves in you.

404
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,081
I...

405
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,293
I want to explain
about your mother's earrings.

406
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,129
They were yours
to do with as you wished.

407
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:56,341
Having purpose is important,

408
00:27:56,425 --> 00:28:00,511
but you already have one.

409
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,556
As a wife, a future mother.

410
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,394
Perhaps being so far away
from the good example

411
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:12,315
set by your own mother
and my dear Eunice

412
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,108
clouded that a bit.

413
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,778
Perhaps a bit.

414
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,864
It's so different out here.

415
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,908
How can a New York girl

416
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:26,120
be expected to get
her bearings in a place like this?

417
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:31,167
- I don't think I've been unduly influenced.
- Hmm.

418
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,712
What if I arranged it

419
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:38,132
so that you could return to your family?

420
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,597
Leave San Francisco?

421
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,559
But Phillip loves it so.

422
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,895
I'm sure he loves you more.

423
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,023
What matters is your marriage,

424
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,693
being close to family
and the people who love you.

425
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:02,448
I've just built some apartments
at the bottom of Central Park.

426
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,617
I'd like you both to have one.

427
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:10,081
With 11 bedrooms, you can bear
as many children as you want.

428
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,335
I'll have to talk it over with Phillip.

429
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,170
He's already decided.

430
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,006
We were discussing it when you arrived.

431
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:27,849
Thank you for letting me know, Dr. Hackett.

432
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:29,642
Goodbye.

433
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,694
Hello. A word, please?

434
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,872
Has Dr. Thackery contacted you?

435
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,540
No.

436
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,626
Nurse Elkins...

437
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,503
He hasn't.

438
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,506
Is something wrong?

439
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:04,635
He disappeared from
Cromartie Hospital sometime last night.

440
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,304
- He disappeared?
- Mmm-hmm.

441
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,222
How?

442
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,577
Hello?

443
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,789
Hello?

444
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,502
Help!

445
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,630
Hey!

446
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,509
Help!

447
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,252
Hello, Thomas.

448
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:20,545
I brought you a few things.

449
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,548
Some hard-boiled eggs, some nuts.

450
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,469
- The guard will just take it all away.
- Ah.

451
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,348
Let's eat it now, then.

452
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,272
Have they, uh, set a court date yet?

453
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,191
Week after next.

454
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:44,652
Any word in the papers?

455
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,945
Not much yet.

456
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,072
There will be once the trial starts.

457
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:51,033
You never should have taken
that job without me.

458
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,161
Harry, we were a team.

459
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:58,541
You'd have brung me
and we wouldn't be in this pickle.

460
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,751
I'd have known if the
coppers were waiting for you.

461
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,337
You were off getting pissed
down the Donegal Pub.

462
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:06,090
All right, fair play.

463
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,306
My name hasn't come up at all, has it?

464
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,808
No.

465
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,936
You thinking of turning yourself in?

466
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:21,480
Christ, no.

467
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,650
I'm just slagging you.

468
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,194
Since when did you forget
how to show your teeth?

469
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,821
Since you got penned up in this place.

470
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,574
You can sleep easy.

471
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,576
Your secret will go to my grave.

472
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,329
Well, I am not gonna
let you rot in this shitbox,

473
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:39,665
even if there's plenty of other folks
who want to pretend like you ain't here.

474
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,125
What are you going to do?

475
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,960
Dig me a tunnel out?

476
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,296
I'm gonna do what rich folks do.

477
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,797
I'm gonna get you a real clever lawyer

478
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,675
with nice suits and a lot of smart words.

479
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,802
Best money can buy.

480
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:55,097
With what money, Mr. Carnegie?

481
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,183
- My money.
- Really?

482
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:02,313
Don't be doing anything foolish, Thomas,

483
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,398
or you'll end up in here.

484
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,151
Pouncey'll be the one
bringing you the undercooked eggs.

485
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,154
The eggs is fine.

486
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,281
Don't you go selling me.

487
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,492
Don't you go selling me short.

488
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,827
I've had a little pile
stuffed in my mattress.

489
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,288
Made some real smart investments.

490
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:22,792
I'll have you out of here in no time.

491
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:28,881
Another early payment.

492
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:32,134
Just some judicious
scrimping and saving, that's all.

493
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:34,470
You'll have no problems from me.

494
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,889
You run a good, clean establishment.

495
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:40,101
Much better than Collier ever did.

496
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,315
Mr. Collier had very little pride.

497
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,192
He didn't respect his women.

498
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,362
He beat his girls, spoke to them rudely.

499
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,947
They barely saw a doctor.

500
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:57,076
Well, it's not easy to get
a doctor to do that kind of work.

501
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:01,997
It is when you own the man
who runs a hospital.

502
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:07,878
I think I see what you're getting at.

503
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:14,552
But parading a horde of prostitutes

504
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:17,012
through the Knick for examination

505
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,598
would take more than a little doing.

506
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,019
I need my women clean.

507
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:29,525
I can't lose my precious
inventory to disease or whore babies.

508
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,320
My customers trust me
to provide a healthy product.

509
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,283
Once a week, I will bring
women to you to be examined.

510
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,662
Respectfully, Mr. Ping,

511
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,915
the hospital, like this establishment,

512
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,917
is a business.

513
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:51,338
I can't just give my services away for free.

514
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,009
I would have to make certain arrangements.

515
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,512
What do you propose?

516
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:03,851
Perhaps a two dollar reduction in my debt

517
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,895
for every girl examined?

518
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,536
Gunner's knot.

519
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,457
Not difficult to tie, but impossible to undo.

520
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,169
Drink.

521
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:52,066
My father made me memorize
every sailing knot

522
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,236
before he'd let me set foot
on one of his boats.

523
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,825
Where are we?

524
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,368
The Atlantic.

525
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,371
What the hell is going on?

526
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,748
I'm cleaning up the mess you've created.

527
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,626
You untie me now.

528
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,045
- I won't.
- You son of a bitch!

529
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,090
You take me back to Cromartie

530
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,176
and you get me my drugs or I will kill you.

531
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,096
I swear I will kill you!

532
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,808
- Can you sail?
- What?

533
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,893
- Can you sail?
- No.

534
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,895
It's tricky business.

535
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,440
Learning to read the charts alone
is enough to drive a man mad.

536
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:37,862
- Meaning?
- Meaning you won't be killing me

537
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,948
and that you only have two options.

538
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,661
Get well or jump off.

539
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,668
Everett!

540
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,296
Everett!

541
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,640
Please, untie me.

542
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,476
I'm feeling much better.

543
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,147
I could use some of that whiskey.

544
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,802
- You take me back.
- No!

545
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,262
God damn it!

546
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:15,352
At least, you're more in control today
than you were yesterday.

547
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,187
We're not there yet.

548
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:19,064
You don't understand.

549
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,153
The need will never go away.

550
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,822
Then you'll fight the need!

551
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:31,702
Don't you dare tie me up again.

552
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,871
I'm gonna make this simple.

553
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:35,664
You want to go to shore,

554
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:40,544
show me you can learn to tie
the first ten knots on the chart in there.

555
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,130
Then I'll know you're in control again.

556
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,677
Ten knots!

557
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,435
Where were the bodies found?

558
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,104
Behind the ship's boilers. Stowaways.

559
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,732
Too poor to even afford steerage, I guess.

560
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:02,816
Rats?

561
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,568
All over the hull.

562
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,904
Were these two seen
anywhere else on the ship?

563
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:07,988
It's hard to say.

564
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,532
Most stowaways stay hidden
until the ship docks,

565
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,868
but once at sea,
they might want some fresh air,

566
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,703
some food and water.

567
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:18,332
Some do take to cooking rats
if they can't steal from the kitchen.

568
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,292
Is that what got 'em, you think?

569
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,212
State of the bodies, the rats,
it's bubonic plague.

570
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,422
We'll know for sure once we get to the lab.

571
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:26,799
I'll need to see the ship's manifest

572
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,009
and a list of everyone
who went through immigration.

573
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,761
This is private property.

574
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,930
Heel-toe it out of here
or we'll toss you out on your ass.

575
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,014
I'm with the health department.

576
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,600
I'm just here to check up
on a couple friends of mine.

577
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,103
Get a good look at what will be killing you,

578
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:42,147
what you will be bringing
home to kill your families, too.

579
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,690
Babies are the first to go, usually.

580
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,776
Dead in a pool of their own vomit and blood!

581
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,821
Shut your trap. I'm on your side.
I'm glad you're here.

582
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:51,198
There's been some sort of
monkey business going on around here.

583
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,450
- What do you mean?
- Meet me back here after six o'clock,

584
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:55,452
and I'll show you the immigration records.
Okay?

585
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:00,165
And stay off my dock, you fucking turd.

586
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,615
Uh...

587
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,742
Come in.

588
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,162
Good morning, Doctor.

589
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,955
Good morning.

590
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,084
Any word from Gallinger?

591
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,879
He's used up his last chance with me.

592
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,089
Right.

593
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:33,467
Well, I had little hope
he'd take orders from you.

594
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:38,889
Who's assisting me
with the tubercular osteomyelitis patient?

595
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,140
I only saw my name.

596
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,477
I'll put Mays on it with you.

597
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:47,314
Mays? Not you?

598
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:51,318
It's a fairly routine procedure.
I'm... I'm sure he can handle it.

599
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:56,990
Great.

600
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,752
That's quite an abscess.

601
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,464
Let's hope
we won't have to amputate.

602
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:22,474
Perhaps I'll begin.

603
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:24,685
Nurse, knife.

604
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,481
I will dissect down to the bone

605
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,277
and see how much pus is in there.

606
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,862
Unless you have other thoughts.

607
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,573
Oh, no, I think that sounds right.

608
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:54,089
I'm, uh, well acquainted with your father.

609
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,134
We were recently seated near each other

610
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:59,261
at an art society dinner.

611
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,932
You know, it was really more of
an excuse to drink good wine

612
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:05,976
and show off our French.

613
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,061
That's nice. All right, I'm through.

614
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,188
Suction wand.

615
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:14,276
Will you be leading the way
on cleaning it out?

616
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,112
Yes, of course.

617
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,292
Do you need assistance?

618
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:34,838
- I'm not exactly an expert in this technique.
- Gauze.

619
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,727
Nice work, Dr. Chickering.
Very nice.

620
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,701
Thank you for being here, Mr. Mayor.

621
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:52,416
This groundbreaking is made much more
special by your presence here today.

622
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,334
You couldn't have done this in April?

623
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,504
I'm freezing my balls off.

624
00:45:57,797 --> 00:45:59,923
Well, I am sorry about that.

625
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:03,009
Allow me to introduce you to our architect.

626
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:05,053
This is Mr. Frazier H. Wingo

627
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:06,763
of the firm Bradley and Wingo.

628
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:08,348
- Mr. Wingo.
- It's a pleasure.

629
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:10,225
We have to grace our city with the finest,

630
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,852
most beautiful hospital in the world.

631
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,979
Yes, and it won't cost you a dime.

632
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:15,397
All private funds.

633
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,190
Which we are still raising.

634
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:18,525
We will get there.

635
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,735
Captain Robertson assures me of that.

636
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,154
Oh, is he here today?

637
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:24,698
August has always been
a strong supporter of mine.

638
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,741
He wanted to be. He is in Norfolk.

639
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:29,411
Seems he's having some new ships built.

640
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,538
But his son Henry is here instead,

641
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,458
representing the family quite well indeed.

642
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,127
Point him out to me
so this isn't a complete waste of time.

643
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,211
Yes, of course.

644
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,800
People will know
the names of the men,

645
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:48,013
of the families, really, who gave
generously to build this hospital.

646
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:50,182
Aside from our name on a plaque

647
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:53,059
and our portrait in a hallway,
there's no real payoff.

648
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:57,063
The payoff, Prettyman,
is assuring your place in God's kingdom.

649
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:00,233
Yeah, well,
your family can think about legacy,

650
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,569
but I'm still building my fortune.

651
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,321
Every penny I have is tied up

652
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:07,782
in winning the contract to build
the new subway line.

653
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:10,118
Where will it run?

654
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:12,746
From City Hall all the way
up to 145th Street.

655
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,374
Do you have all the funds you need?

656
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:21,338
Enough to rig the bid,
but short of what I need to get it done.

657
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,049
Oh, look at that.

658
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:25,967
You were looking to empty my wallet,

659
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:28,720
but I might just end up emptying yours.

660
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,264
Guess who.

661
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,225
- Uh, Daisy.
- No.

662
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,560
- Constance?
- For heaven's sake.

663
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,896
I've barely been gone and you've already

664
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,815
run roughshod over every girl in New York.

665
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,901
- Neely, doll!
- We're back.

666
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,072
I, I didn't expect you so soon.

667
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:50,033
I wanted to be here for the groundbreaking.

668
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:54,454
Oh, uh... Harold. You remember Harold?

669
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,623
- Yes. Good morning.
- Good morning. How are you?

670
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,918
We'll finish talking about
that opportunity later.

671
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:03,755
I swear to you,
I will never leave this city ever again.

672
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,799
Well, I won't let you.

673
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,218
- Where's Phillip?
- Well, he's taken the baggage

674
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,095
and is getting us settled
in our new apartment.

675
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,389
Algie. Algie, look who it is.

676
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:16,309
Cornelia?

677
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,436
Oh. He's as surprised as I am.

678
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,772
She's back, for good.

679
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:25,235
Come with me. I have something to show you.

680
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,825
Stand there together.

681
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,118
What is that thing?

682
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:34,786
A moving picture camera.

683
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,871
Purchased it from Mr. Edison's company.

684
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:38,665
Stand closer together.

685
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,917
A little to the left.

686
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,336
Henry.

687
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:47,549
Mayor Van Wyck
would love a word if you have a moment.

688
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,426
Excuse us. Yeah?

689
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,931
Mayor Van Wyck, this is Henry Robertson.

690
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:58,602
- Phillip.
- Algernon.

691
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:01,354
- Welcome back, Phillip.
- Thank you so much.

692
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:03,940
You couldn't miss this, could you?

693
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:05,692
- Not for the world.
- Mmm.

694
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,153
How's the apartment?

695
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:10,572
- Not finished, apparently.
- What?

696
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:12,782
My father assumed it would be completed,

697
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:16,119
but ran into some slowdowns
while he was traveling.

698
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:18,496
We could live with my parents.

699
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,165
It's all been taken care of.

700
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,667
Dad felt terribly about the delay,

701
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:25,670
so he insisted all our things be
brought to their house immediately.

702
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:28,298
An entire floor has been
prepared for us, so...

703
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,884
We'll be living in your father's house?

704
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,969
For how long?

705
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:35,221
Four months at the most.

706
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:36,681
Maybe five.

707
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,142
It'll be fun.

708
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:48,068
Ah! All right, everyone.

709
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:49,444
We're all set.

710
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,113
Let's man our shovels, shall we, gentlemen?

711
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:54,407
Right this way. Very good.

712
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,036
Photographers, reporters, this way.

713
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,163
Up front. Thank you.

714
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:05,335
Gentlemen, if we could come to
the lip of the stage for the photograph.

715
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,753
Thank you.

716
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:09,172
All right, my friends.

717
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,757
Shovels ready.

718
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:14,886
Now, remember, this will be
in every paper in the city,

719
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,971
so let's give it our all.

720
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:21,226
Hold on a moment.
I seem to have one too many shovels.

721
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,064
Dr. Edwards.

722
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,108
Please, come join us.

723
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:33,947
It's only fitting that
our acting chief of surgery

724
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:37,075
shows us how to
make a first cut into the earth.

725
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,786
Could've given it to the police chief.

726
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,914
- Is this your idea of taking it slow?
- I couldn't resist.

727
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,667
All right, everyone, on the count of three.

728
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,586
One, two, three.

729
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:55,677
Mr. Wingo.

730
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,512
Masterful. Well done.

731
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,944
I've had a revelation.

732
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:18,199
If I was up against a medical problem,

733
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,577
I would look for a cure.

734
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:23,913
Stop the disease.

735
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:27,292
Mend the bone, staunch the bleeding.

736
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,549
That's the goal anyway.

737
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:38,720
If I treat my desire for drugs

738
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:42,307
not as a craving, but as a sickness,

739
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,269
that means there must be a cure.

740
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:49,981
And if there is,

741
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:52,942
I'm gonna find it.

742
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:05,079
Number ten.

743
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:13,963
Let's go home.

744
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:33,691
Nice view.
