at the rank of third surgeon,

00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,036
who has joined us from the Knickerbocker,

is for lab work.

So, in order to give him
a chance to get settled in,

30
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,800
he'll join Guggenheim in the lab

31
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,221
to search for surgical applications
for the new gland extract.

32
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,975

You'll help us learn
if it has any practical uses.

So, unless there are any other questions,

40

No, it was more
the disappointed look on your face

50
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,365
when you were told you'd be
working in the lab to start.

51

Did Dr. Zinberg notice?

52
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,905
Well, you concealed it well.

53
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:06,126
He's letting me know that I'm going to have
to earn my way into the operating room,

54
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,754
and letting them know
that he's going to ease me into the fold.

There's thought in everything he does.

56

He's a very deliberate man.

57
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,016
Is that why he has you
taking notes of his meetings?

58
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,433
Why, because I couldn't
possibly be a surgeon like you?

179
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:44,209
but you must understand that I'm trying
to save girls like your daughter with my work.

180
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,171
But let's be frank here,

181
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,924
your daughter isn't the only person
in the family who has a problem.

182
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,933
You have as much interest
in finding a cure as I do.

183
00:11:57,008 --> 00:12:00,262
You help me, and perhaps
with what I learn, I can help you.

184
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,477
I'll work as fast as I can
and you can bury her in a few days.

185
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,979
You won't cut her face?

186
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,692
I'll protect it with my life.

187

You promised I'd have my fee, Mr. Cleary.

188
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,997

is gonna cover all your costs.

Mr. Whitting, you asked
for this pre-trial hearing, correct?

199
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,302
I did, Your Honor.

200
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:24,684
In front of me are 16 past cases thrown out

201
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,981
due to proven entrapment by
the New York Vice Department.

202
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,400
All of which have no relevance here.

203
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,477
Each case on its own merits, Counselor.

204
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:35,361
But an examination of the files
will clearly show uncommon similarities

205
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,741
between those wrongly accused citizens
and my client, Sister Harriet.

206
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,617
I think it only fair...

207
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,916
Do not tell me what is fair
in my courtroom, Mr. Whitting.

murderous nature of your people.

217

I will use this courtroom
and the strength of my God

218
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,362
to sound a warning against the people
now flooding our shores

219
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:26,040

00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,728
Just the sniffles, Chickering.

535
00:34:57,554 --> 00:35:01,434
You can be aggressive around here,
but we don't go in for sloppy or stupid.

536
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,688
Of course.

537
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,314
What do you mean no match?

538
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,570
You trying to bed her
or beat her in badminton?

539
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,744
I'm not trying to bed her, Leo.

540
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,410
If it came to that,

541
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,085
I worry I'm not experienced enough for her

542
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,172
the way an older man might be.

543
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,248
LEOI Ah.

544
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:29,011
There's experience out there for the taking.

545
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,635
I get mine every Tuesday

546
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,933
at a Negro brothel on 29th Street.

547
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:39,013
As experiences go, it's worth every penny.

550

You have your subway partner.

551
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,456
Did you convince your father
to sell some of his ships?

552
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,210
I've been able to find
some savings for the company

553
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,334
which I think could be put
to better use elsewhere.

554
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,165
Better than in reinvesting?

555
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,961
How does your father feel
about you betting against him?

556
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,045
He doesn't know.

557
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,093
And I'd like to keep it that way.

558
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:20,479
If he wants to stay blindly adrift
in the 19th century, that's his business.

559
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,850
Now here's to ours.

560
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,531
GALLINGER: It shouldn't be difficult to excise
from the base of the tumor.

561
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,959
Yes, there it is.

562
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,255
We will now bisect the healthy liver tissue
leading to the tumor

563
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,712
and tie off all blood vessels contained within.

564
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,594
Or we could simply strangle the vessels
leading to the tumor

565
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:57,845
and not bother the healthy liver.

566
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,096
Which would be lazy.

567
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,223
As opposed to slicing the liver further,
which would be idiotic.

568
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:04,272
There is no idiocy in removing
blood supply for any future tumors.

569
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,977
It will be done delicately
and the decision has been made.

Nurse Pell.

571
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,364
Please hand Dr. Gallinger a clean scalpel

572
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,987
with our thinnest blade so he may carry out...

00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,160
- You want me to do it?
- Yes.

574
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:19,992
Yes.

575
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:31,378
I will now bisect the healthy liver tissue
leading to the tumor

576

contained within.

Can I get your assistance in Pathological?

00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,074
I think I might be onto something.

580
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,409
Let's go.

THACKERYI Yes?

583
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,800
Why do you always go to him?

584
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,882
What do you mean?

585
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,764
Why do you always choose Edwards over me?

586
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,557
Well, this is simply something
for which he's better suited.

587
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:35,651
Yeah, it was me who saved you.

588
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,817
And I'm eternally grateful.

589
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,449
You know my appreciation
for you is not an issue here.

590
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:44,247
I just need someone with whom
I can work with on this research.

591
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,329
Since he started here,

592
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,332
Edwards has invented and improved
procedure after procedure,

593
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,788
technique after technique.

594
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:56,092
Everett, if you want to collaborate with me,

595
00:38:56,167 --> 00:39:00,422
then jealousy won't serve you a tenth
as well as ambition and effort.

The syphilis spirochete.

599
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:13,397
Our goal is to kill that bastard.

600
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,313
Eloquent.

601
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,865
How do you propose to do that?

602
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,319
So, I read in this Austrian journal

603
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:25,622
that several syphilis patients
inexplicably improved.

604
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:29,543
The only link was that all had been
suffering from various other illnesses.

605
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,837
Strep, pneumonia, meningitis.

606
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,505
I've heard similar stories in Europe.

607
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:36,709
The belief is that the syphilis spirochete
was killed off

608
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,135
by something in the strep
or the pneumococcus.

609
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,134
No, that wasn't what killed the syphilis at all.

610
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,636
I have tried to kill that thing
under the microscope

611
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:45,808
with everything I can think of.

612
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,353
Anything I can safely put in a human body.

613
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:49,395
Nothing worked.

614
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,892
I thought it was indestructible

615
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:54,101
until finally it died on its own one night

616
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,609
while I was working under the light
of several lamps, focused on my work.

617
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:01,316
-It's light sensitive?
- No.

618
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,409
It's the heat.

619
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:07,869
I was baking under those lamps
and so was the disease.

620
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:12,294
Syphilis can be killed by temperature.

621
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,915
How high?

622
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:17,340
One hundred and six,
107 degrees Fahrenheit.

623
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,173
If I can induce a fever in a syphilis patient

624
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,254
and get it high enough,

625
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,386
I can bake the disease to death.

626
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:28,765
Yes, and the patient in the process.

627
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,845
You are talking about lethal temperatures.

628
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,773
Yes, to cure a lethal disease.

629
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,449
Suppose you could induce the fever
using something curable.

630
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,322
- Like what?
- Malaria.

631
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,697
It's a deadly disease
inducing terribly high fever,

632
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,748
but with a relatively dependable cure.

633
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,368

She's developing motor
coordination problems.

644
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:21,147
You know, the blood vessels in her brain
are swelling and clotting.

645
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,442
It won't be long
before the seizures come.

646
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,701
The thrombosis.

647
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,120
And death.

648
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,051
Where do we start?

649
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,921
Where we usually do,

00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:49,766

FRAZIER: Yes, changes are always
expected during construction,

652
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,523
but what you're asking is quite extensive.

653
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:02,274
HERMAN: Well, the board thinks the matter
important enough to implement the changes.

654
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,105
Well, I understand the lnebriety Ward,

655
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,192
but some of these things
you're asking for make very little sense.

656
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:10,996
Changing ceiling heights, moving walls, why?

657
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,913
It's all very disruptive,

658
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,617
not to mention it will cost a fortune
in materials and manpower.

659
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,202
The board wants what it wants.

660
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,628
Then I should speak to them.

661
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,831
Mr. Wingo, I sympathize,

662
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:25,589
but questioning the board to their faces
is not a recipe for keeping yourjob.

663
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,170
I should know.

664
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:31,474
I fought these on your behalf
and nearly found myself out on the street.

665
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,428
I don't want that fate to befall you,

666
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:39,357
a man who does not have nearly
the history with these men that I do.

667
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,019
Thank you for your counsel.

668
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,656
- The changes will be made.
- Good.

669
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,322
Make me a list
of the extra materials you'll need

670
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,951
and I'll send them along to the contractors.

671
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,452
Where is the tender?

672
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,038
Where's the fire tender, damn it?

673
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,243
Who's supposed to be on watch?

674
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,204
It's Mr. Blackledge, sir.

675
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,540
I think he went to piss.

676
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,921
Well, when he buttons up, tell him he's fired.

677
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,923
He can follow that piss down the hole.

678
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,754
You're the new tender now.

679
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,090
Make sure the fires don't go out
and don't burn the place down

680
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,972
or you can follow Blackledge
and his piss. Understood?

681
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,520
- Understood?
- Yes, Mr. Wingo.

682
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,642
Go.

683
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:22,521
Well done, Frazier.

684
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,694
I won't allow negligence.

685
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:28,023
Perhaps, just to be safe,

686
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:31,576
we should slow construction
down a bit despite the cost.

687
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,330
We don't want to take any unnecessary risks.

688
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:39,792
I have to be hard on these men.
They have to know who's boss.

689
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,540
Of course.

690
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,249
I have always said a little bit of fear

691
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,333
can be a very good thing.

- You piece of shit.

693
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,734
- You're...
- Not in a fucking hole in the ground?

694
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,186
- No, I ain't.
- I had nothing to do with it.

695
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:07,987
I swear, I do not know who took out Bunky.

696
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,735
And sliced me up good.

697
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:12,317
Bellevue boys sewed me up like a rag doll.

698
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:16,033
But here I am. And here you are.

00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,329

I'm just delivering a message.

702
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:26,001
You got to come to Tammany Hall

703
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,924
and make your accounts
for this here building.

704
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,502
You work for Tammany?

705
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:31,552
Yeah.

706
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,005
And I ain't Jimmy to you no more.

707
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,557

You'd do well to remember that.

00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:48,728
Okay.

711
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,963
Mr. Barrow gave me very specific instructions

712
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,515
that I must have a written report
of the patient's ailment

713
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,763
before I can dispense any of the narcotics.

714
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,846
And only to a doctor or a nurse.

715
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:25,974
Answer me this, then.

716
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:28,480
How am I supposed to write a report,

717
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,607
from Houston Street or wherever,

718
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:34,316
when l'vejust picked up a body
that's been kicked in the chest by a mule?

719
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:39,074
Now, having those drugs on the ambulance

720
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:43,249
could be the difference
between putting them on the ward

721
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,951
or putting them in the morgue.

722
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:57,342
Good news, Herman.

723
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,925
I was at the club last night,
carousing with the fellows,

724
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,511
and we got to talking about you.

725
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:09,434
I've now got enough backers
to bring you in to interview for membership.

726
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,402
- Really?
- Not to worry.

727

I'll be by your side the whole time
trumpeting your worthiness.

728

729
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,246
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

730
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,299

733
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,650
and do my hairjust right for you.

734
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,227
I hope you'll forgive me.

740
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,997

with my school studies

and to that fat fellow before him

745
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,425

746
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,595
Yes, I have been waiting that long.

00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,173
Ever since you obtained a new <i>boss,</i>

748
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,759
it seems harder than ever
to see you. Why is that?

749

Did <i>he take out an advertisement
in The Morning Telegraph?</i>

750

ls there a billboard of you on Broadway?

751
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,192
Are you jealous?

752
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:38,865
I just thought you would always
want me at the head of the line.
