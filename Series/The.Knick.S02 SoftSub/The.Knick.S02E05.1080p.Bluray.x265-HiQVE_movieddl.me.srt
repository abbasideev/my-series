00:00:01,109 --> 00:00:06,109
http://hiqve.com/

2
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,926
I told you I'm fine.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,678
I feel much stronger today

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:15,431
and I'd feel much better still
if I were at home surrounded by my things.

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,725
Well, I'd feel better
if I could keep watch on you.

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,810
Hmm.

7
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,814
There could be some latent symptoms
caused by the malaria.

8
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,108
You know, fever, chills.

9
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:29,654
Take a pinch of this
at the first sign of any symptoms.

10
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,698
- It's Quinine.
- Oh.

11
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:34,367
Now all I need do
is lay in a stock of gin and limes

12
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,035
and I can make a party of it.

13
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,088
Worry about your other patients, John.

14
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,257
I'll look in on you later.

15
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,363
One second.

16
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,165
Yes?

17
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:59,035
In the last century,
neurologists have revolutionized

18
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,622
our understanding of the human brain.

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,625
Using electric currents, they discovered

20
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:10,797
that precise points of the brain can be
stimulated to reveal their specific functions.

21
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:15,384
Seated in front of you is Mr. Sidney Carton.

22
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,137
Mr. Carton was recently
involved in an accident

23
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:21,390
that resulted in the loss
of the top of his cranium.

24
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:26,854
Fortunately, for the benefit of
our experiments today,

25
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:30,107
his brain was left unharmed.

26
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:45,581
I will now deliver small currents
into the patient's brain to demonstrate.

27
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:51,337
We only have a vague idea
of what happens in any given area.

28
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:56,759
As you know, the brain itself feels no pain,
so Mr. Carton won't feel a thing.

29
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:23,119
Electricity can also affect our emotions.

30
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,622
I will now demonstrate.

31
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,940
Stop. Stop.

32
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,151
Stop it.

33
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,196
And what about desire?

34
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,951
Mr. Carton is a morphine addict.

35
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,329
He injects himself multiple times a day.

36
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,833
But for the past 24 hours,
he has been denied the drug.

37
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:24,180
As you can see,
his need for the morphine is immense.

38
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,331
Other than discharging electricity,

39
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,501
this device, a rheoscope, can detect it.

40
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,506
Using it,

41
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,134
I hope to identify
the region of Mr. Carton's brain

42
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,804
that is stimulated by the morphine.

43
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,556
Gentlemen,

44
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,686
it seems that X marks the spot.

45
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,225
What's the matter with you?

46
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,643
I...

47
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,562
I don't know.

48
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,022
Have you eaten anything today?

49
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,566
It's her time of the month.

50
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,234
Cramps?

51
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,361
You having your monthly?

52
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,447
How old are you?

53
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,240
Eighteen.

54
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,786
Nobody's properly taught you
about the functions of your body?

55
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,622
All right.

56
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,832
I'll tell you what you're going to do.

57
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:01,420
You beg 20 cents off one of the nuns,
walk if you can to the pharmacy.

58
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:05,091
Ask the man there
to sell you a bottle of cannabis indica.

59
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,884
Cannabis indica.

60
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,803
I'll write it down for you so you remember.

61
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,348
Why not some hashish, too, while she's at it?

62
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,185
Are you fit enough to continue with work?

63
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,230
Yes, Sister.

64
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:24,568
At the very least, give the poor girl leave
to fetch a couple of aspirin.

65
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:29,031
Aspirin will not cure God's will.
It's the curse of Eve.

66
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,951
The curse of Eve
is to bring forth children in pain,

67
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,161
not to suffer menstrual cramps.

68
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,746
Much the same thing.

69
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:40,543
And I'll thank the likes of you
not to instruct me in matters of theology.

70
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,129
I was just trying to help the poor girl.

71
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,881
Like you helped all those unborn babies?

72
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,302
Don't let me catch you
talking to these girls again, Dolan.

73
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,515
Did you hear me, all the rest of you?

74
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,810
This woman is the worst kind of sinner,

75
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,687
an infanticide.

76
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,772
And you will not speak to her.

77
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,358
Not so much as a good morning.

78
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,944
Unless you don't want to eat.

79
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,423
Henry, this is inspired.

80
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,092
Imagine the fortune you'd make
showing this on the Bowery.

81
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:34,680
You've single-handedly
brought self-abuse into the 20th century.

82
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,223
Pun intended.

83
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,019
What I don't understand
is why you didn't jump in there yourself.

84
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:43,439
Well, somebody had to crank the camera.

85
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,942
I volunteer.

86
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,416
What'll it be, sir?

87
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,835
Care for a White Lion?

88
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:51,757
Or perhaps a White Tiger's Milk.

89
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,968
Just a couple of whiskeys.

90
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,469
Hmm.

91
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:04,144
I'm sorry, Bertie.
I couldn't think of anywhere else to take you.

92
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,106
No, no. It's a novelty.

93
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,525
My father will be scandalized.

94
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,580
So, what is it
that you wanted to talk to me about?

95
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,710
I've had some bad news.

96
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,129
My mother has laryngeal cancer.

97
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,800
- I'm sorry, Bertie.
- Thank you.

98
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,385
That's terrible.

99
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,681
What course are you considering?

100
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,477
I thought perhaps
that you might have encountered

101
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:49,898
more pioneering procedures
during your years abroad.

102
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,319
Have you consulted
with Dr. Zinberg about this?

103
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:57,489
No, Dr. Zinberg is the kind of man
who wears both suspenders and a belt,

104
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,241
if you take my meaning.

105
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,701
He would never approve a procedure

106
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:05,247
that hadn't passed years of rigorous
laboratory experimentation and peer review.

107
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,335
I have to say I feel like
it's because he's a Jew.

108
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,254
I believe being a universally despised race

109
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,173
has stiffened their resolve
to never act rashly

110
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,426
and risk being thought a failure
in the eyes of a hostile world.

111
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,850
Some months ago,
I read a paper coauthored by Pierre Curie

112
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:29,772
on the treatment of malignant tumors using
radium and other radioactive substances.

113
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:35,277
I could translate it from the French
if you could find a copy of it somewhere.

114
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:40,074
Bertie,
you smell just like McSorley's Bar.

115
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,950
Have you been in a saloon tonight?

116
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,453
How do you know
what McSorley's smells like, huh?

117
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,081
I didn't think they permitted women in there.

118
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,083
I have ways
of getting into places.

119
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,838
Bertie, how on earth did you do this?

120
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,966
Well, I, too, have ways
of getting into places.

121
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,805
You find anything?

122
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,642
No, but you're still researching adrenaline,
aren't you?

123
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,519
Yes. Why?

124
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:12,648
Because here's a paper about it
from the University of Kraków.

125
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:16,860
You read Polish?

126
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,029
Yeah.

127
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,407
Very impressive.

128
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,075
Voilà.

129
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,203
The French Academy of Sciences,
December 1900.

130
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,791
This is it.

131
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,710
So how often do you engage
in criminal activity?

132
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,171
Not often.

133
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,965
Please don't tell my mother.

134
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,134
If she found out
that I'd become a second-story man,

135
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,760
she'd be heartbroken.

136
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,531
Henry Robertson.

137
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,200
What?

138
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,708
Yeah, let me call you back.

139
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,600
I'll go in the back.

140
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,610
- What happened?
- Dynamite explosion.

141
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,820
Subway excavation on Park Avenue.

142
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,113
- How many injured?
- Don't know.

143
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,115
They're still pulling
bodies out of the ground.

144
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,576
But it's not gonna end any time soon.

145
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,369
Thack, where should we put them?

146
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,955
- The wards?
- No, we'll need them for recovery.

147
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,751
Fetch every operating table in the hospital
and get them into the theater.

148
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,086
- Help him, Edwards.
- No, I should stay and sort the patients.

149
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,173
No, Nurse Elkins is more than qualified.

150
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,216
Any questions?

151
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,384
- Should I use the hallways as a waiting room?
- Good.

152
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,262
Anything else,
just make it up as you go along.

153
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,517
Yeah, up front. You're driving.

154
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,644
You're gonna let me drive?

155
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,188
I'm staying here.

156
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,524
Someone's got to ride roughshod
over the likes of them.

157
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:22,152
Ambulances coming in from all over.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

158
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:23,862
Get the fuck out of here, man.

159
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,739
How in the hell do you drive this thing?

160
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,702
- So what do we have?
- His pelvis is shattered.

161
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,705
Need to resect the gut
and set the bone somehow.

162
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,209
There's no time. Splint the hips,
staunch the bleeds, and shove the rest inside.

163
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:41,046
- I don't need your advice, Edwards.
- He's right, Everett. Just do what he says.

164
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,883
How deeply embedded do you think this is?

165
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,760
Hopefully not as far as the lungs.

166
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:51,223
I don't see any external trauma,
but stand by just in case.

167
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,529
Lung's collapsed.

168
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,322
- Scalpel.
- Bring him in.

169
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,495
Trocar.

170
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,217
Dr. Thackery.

171
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,637
- You got it?
- Dr. Thackery.

172
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:37,311
Okay, let's clean him up,
see how deep they are.

173
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,689
Coming in, right now.

174
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,365
Don't. Don't pull it out
or you'll bleed to death.

175
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,284
We're gonna get you right into surgery.

176
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,454
Ten grains of morphine.

177
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,041
That compound fracture can wait.

178
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,878
Let's get some pressure under his head.

179
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,968
Nurse Beckman? This is Henry Robertson.

180
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:13,972
Hello. Look, we have an emergency.
We need all nurses here immediately.

181
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,391
You live with Nurse Nash, don't you?

182
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,018
No need to get changed.

183
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,396
Report directly to Nurse Taylor.
She'll tell you where you're most needed.

184
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,358
And don't bother with
normal admissions protocol.

185
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:28,236
Just sign them all in as John Doe
and we'll sort it out later.

186
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:32,699
Nurse Taylor, I have
four more sets of hands for you.

187
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,868
Orderly.

188
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,162
We're out of beds and gurneys.

189
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:42,084
I need you to find every couch, bench, chair,
anything you can lay a patient on.

190
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,669
No room is off-limits.

191
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,177
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

192
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,888
Out of my way, Cleary.
I need to see a man about my carting fees.

193
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,682
- How many?
- That was the fourth.

194
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,809
And they were all still breathing
when I got here.

195
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,520
Your hospital administrator owes me
a total of four simoleons.

196
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,772
- Now, will you kindly let me pass?
- No.

197
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,691
But I'll tell you what I will do.

198
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,359
I'll take your name down and I'll make sure

199
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,861
that Mr. Barrow's aware of
the Knick's debt to you.

200
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:13,115
I'm sure he'll get around to paying it
in three weeks or so.

201
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,950
Three weeks?

202
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,870
Or you can have your money
right now from me.

203
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,539
What's the catch?

204
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:24,334
The catch is I'm offering two bits per.

205
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,253
Two bits per body.

206
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,588
So instead of waiting three weeks
for the $4 I'm owed,

207
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,216
you're offering to pay me $1 right now?

208
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,260
Cash on the barrelhead.

209
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,520
Excuse me.

210
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,732
Help me. Help me. You've got to help me.

211
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,527
- Take him straight to surgery.
- But I...

212
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,029
I have a wife and a little daughter.

213
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,116
Dr. Thackery.

214
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,245
Finish up and dress the wound.

215
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,663
Yes, Doctor.

216
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,928
Put him under.

217
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,432
I can't go slicing around.
He's losing too much blood.

218
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,268
- The X-ray is full.
- No time for that.

219
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,790
What are you doing?

220
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,209
I'm gonna use this wire as a probe.

221
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,379
If it comes in contact with any metal,

222
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,049
then it'll close the circuit

223
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,219
and we should be able to hear it.

224
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,308
Come with me.

225
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,768
Towel clamp.

226
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,584
I hear something.

227
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,128
- A crackle.
- Forceps.

228
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,362
Ambulances have begun arriving less often.

229
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,530
Good.

230
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,284
I had a look around the wards
and they're full to bursting.

231
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,411
Just what I wanted to talk with you about.

232
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,705
Have you any thoughts as to
how much we should charge

233
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,623
the subway construction company?

234
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,211
Charge them nothing.

235
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,631
Beg your pardon?

236
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:21,052
This is nothing less than a civic duty.
We won't take a penny for it.

237
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,804
It would be dishonorable.

238
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,725
Nobody makes a profit here today.

239
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,167
Quite a day.

240
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,212
I, for one, am glad to see it end.

241
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:01,384
And now we come
to the hour of our settlement.

242
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:04,930
That's 124 patients in total.

243
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,641
A new milestone for the Knick.

244
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,810
And myself, personally, I don't mind saying.

245
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,313
Cleary, you can't honestly
expect me to believe

246
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,900
you carted 124 patients here by yourself.

247
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:22,197
Let's just say I made a little arrangement
with the other fellas.

248
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,532
How much did you pay them?

249
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,284
Two bits a head.

250
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,287
Not a bad return.

251
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:33,833
$124 from a $31 investment.

252
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:40,256
Unfortunately, I think you'll find
you squandered your capital.

253
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,719
The fuck are you talking about?

254
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,556
The president of the hospital's
board of directors has decreed

255
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:52,310
that no one will profit
from today's calamity.

256
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:55,563
And that, I'm afraid, includes you, Cleary.

257
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,235
If you have any complaints,
you can take it up with Henry Robertson.

258
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,116
Fuck me sideways.

259
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,920
Hey, sorry I'm late.

260
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,840
How are you feeling?

261
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,466
Rather anxious, to tell you the truth.

262
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,552
I've been tossing in bed for hours.

263
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,852
Here's laudanum.

264
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,520
Help you sleep.

265
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,106
Three drops in a glass of water.

266
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,068
Is there anything I can help you with?

267
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,612
Just the bedclothes, please.

268
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,883
Put that away, John.

269
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,342
Please.

270
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,138
- Abby...
- Not here.

271
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:06,778
The only thing I can think to do for her now
is to help her sleep through the pain.

272
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,865
She could never abide laudanum, you know.

273
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,411
But I don't know what else to do.

274
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,873
Dad,

275
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:24,337
I've been studying a paper
that was published this past year in Paris

276
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,048
about radium and the treatment of cancer.

277
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:29,634
It's largely untested.

278
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,010
Do it.

279
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,426
Well, well.

280
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,012
Now what do you have to say?

281
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:21,269
I bet you'd feel the prize booby today
if I had let you invest in that subway scheme.

282
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,280
What ships are expected today?

283
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:37,327
The Phoenicia out of Hamburg
and the L'Aquitaine out of Le Havre.

284
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,621
The L'Aquitaine was expected last week.

285
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:44,626
She suffered mechanical difficulties.
Needs a month in dry dock.

286
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:49,214
The entire fleet needs a month in dry dock.

287
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,091
Well, what about all the new ships, Henry?

288
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,510
What the hell is taking so long?

289
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:58,348
They'd already be seaworthy
if you built them when I first told you to.

290
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,476
Now, in order to keep the old ships afloat,

291
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,480
I've had to dip into the funds we borrowed
to finish the new ones.

292
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,191
You can imagine
how we stand with our creditors.

293
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,947
Now is not the time to be timid.

294
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:18,743
We should sell at auction
every last rusty bucket

295
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,579
and put the money into new technologies.

296
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,165
Such as the subway?

297
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,669
150 wounded, six dead.

298
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:32,674
The city will be settling lawsuits
from now until the day we can fly to work.

299
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:39,264
Let me remind you
what Baron Rothschild said.

300
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:43,518
The time to invest
is when there's blood running in the streets.

301
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,407
I need to get going.

302
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:58,658
Mmm. Of course.

303
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,206
Thank you, Abby.

304
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,000
For everything.

305
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:11,713
Well, you cure my syphilis,
I make you breakfast.

306
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,298
Seems like a fair trade.

307
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,509
What will I have to do for dinner?

308
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,348
Sorry.

309
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:25,560
Old habit.

310
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,334
You can come down now, Lin-Lin. You're fine.

311
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,085
No sores or warts.

312
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,858
What do you see?

313
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,486
Nothing that's bad.

314
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,786
- That's from me?
- Mmm-hmm.

315
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,705
You're lucky.

316
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:31,376
We're gonna have to start
the two other girls on mercury treatment.

317
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,211
Thank you.

318
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,838
If you ever have any burning,
itching, or pain down there,

319
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,256
you come to me immediately.

320
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,841
No work.

321
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,343
Maybe work a little.

322
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,345
No, no sex.

323
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,515
You don't have to have sex to make money.

324
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,643
Well, you can't guarantee
that a customer won't want intercourse

325
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,894
and that's a problem.

326
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,856
I make him want other things.
When he's in my hand,

327
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,942
I control him.

328
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,653
That's when I can get anything I want.

329
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:25,888
Quite a weighty tome
for a delicate dove like you.

330
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,183
It's a medical textbook.

331
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:35,982
You know, I've noticed
an interesting phenomenon

332
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:39,026
associated with medical textbooks.

333
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,655
Whenever I chance to open one,

334
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,116
I'm always convinced that I

335
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,411
suffer from whatever disease
happens to catch my eye.

336
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:52,373
I don't think you'll suffer this one.

337
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,878
Oh, God.

338
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,383
It's just a disease of the uterus.

339
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:06,179
Surely you're not unacquainted
with that part of the woman's body.

340
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,310
Whatever do you mean, Nurse Elkins?

341
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,400
You've been through the nursing staff
like Grant through Richmond.

342
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:25,364
And you think that has

343
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:30,953
acquainted me to an unusual degree
with female anatomy?

344
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,459
Stands to reason.

345
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,629
My adrenaline research.

346
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,759
I look forward to reading this
over the weekend.

347
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,723
But if it's all I expect it to be,

348
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:54,393
consider your position here
significantly improved

349
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:57,188
and in short order indeed.

350
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,690
I was hoping you'd say that.

351
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,029
Here's a paper
published by the French Academy of Sciences

352
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:08,282
on the treatment of cancer
using radioactive substances,

353
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,868
and it found that malignant tumors
are more susceptible

354
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:13,788
to the influences of radiation
than normal tissue.

355
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,916
And I was wondering
if it might be possible to use that fact

356
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,294
to isolate a tumor and improve
its chances of successful removal.

357
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,425
An intriguing hypothesis.

358
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:32,431
Let's talk about it after you've finished
your work with adrenaline.

359
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,856
Well, we're all here.

360
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,568
Gentlemen, may I introduce Edward Croker,

361
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:47,071
chief of the Fire Department
of the City of New York.

362
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,364
Chief Croker.

363
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:53,160
There will be an investigation, of course,
after which they'll convene a grand jury.

364
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,412
But I can tell you right now,

365
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:59,125
the upshot is the poor bastard responsible
for the dynamite storehouse on Park

366
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:02,086
will be posthumously charged
with criminal negligence.

367
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,088
And that, for all practical purposes,

368
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,592
will discharge us
from any legal responsibility.

369
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,177
However, I believe it will still be necessary

370
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:13,806
to buy out the residents of Park Avenue
whose homes were damaged.

371
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:18,185
By my reckoning,
$1 million should do the trick.

372
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,439
Can I rely upon you gentlemen
for a third part of it each?

373
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:24,025
Henry, will that be a problem?

374
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,569
No. No, it won't.

375
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,741
I paid a visit
to Mr. Speight's residence

376
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:34,327
and I think you'll be
interested to learn that

377
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:37,830
his family and all of his belongings
are nowhere to be seen.

378
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,999
I found that in the fireplace.

379
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:44,003
It's a second-class ticket
on the Ardlethen out of Rotterdam.

380
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:48,633
I can't make out the holder's Christian name,
but his surname is Petrizzi.

381
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,677
I looked it up
and the ship arrived here just last month,

382
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:55,181
so there's a possibility
Mr. Petrizzi is still in town.

383
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,152
I found that
in the inside pocket of Mr. Speight's jacket

384
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,488
after the coroner sent over his clothes.

385
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,577
The pages have been mostly washed clean,
but there is one entry there.

386
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,290
Pasteurella pestis.

387
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,169
Well, that's bubonic plague.

388
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,676
Is that the brain of Mr. Carton,
your morphine addict?

389
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,428
No, no, no, no.
This is just a lab sample.

390
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,056
Mr. Carton is still very much alive.

391
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,101
So...

392
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:44,855
This corresponds to the part of his brain

393
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,150
that lit up like a Roman candle
when he was given the morphine.

394
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,320
I'm working under the hypothesis

395
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:56,367
that by detaching the affected area,
his cravings may be eliminated.

396
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:02,123
The risk is accidentally damaging
another part of the brain in the process.

397
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,876
May I offer an alternative?

398
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,002
Like what?

399
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,004
Something far less drastic.

400
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,214
Vasectomy?

401
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,973
Everett, unless you know something I don't,

402
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,727
I really don't see
how severing the tubes of his testicles

403
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,563
will cure Mr. Carton
of his morphine addiction.

404
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:30,025
No, but it'll certainly prove effective
of curing society of the likes of him.

405
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,819
That sounds like the eugenicist line.

406
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,573
If we can prevent those unfortunates
from producing their own offspring,

407
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:38,075
the amount of congenital defectives
will be decreased.

408
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,829
Subsequent generations of our race
will be that much better going forward.

409
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,665
Your race?

410
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,547
Well, I suppose this is progress.

411
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:59,638
In the antebellum South, they would cite the
Bible as justification for Negro inferiority.

412
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,223
- Your point?
- Well.

413
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,937
Now instead, you justify your racism
using some asinine pseudoscience.

414
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:09,273
I can understand why you're emotional.

415
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:14,111
Future knowledge always sounds
like pseudoscience until it's accepted.

416
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,489
- I have something you should accept.
- For God's sake, gentlemen.

417
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:19,533
Even this brain is
getting bored of this horseshit.

418
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:22,828
Please.

419
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,294
I think the Corton Clos du Roi '93
with the meat,

420
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:34,340
then the Meursault-Perrieres
'87 with the fish

421
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:35,841
and...

422
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:40,137
Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label '93 with dessert.

423
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,061
You'll like dessert.

424
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,814
Sherry's makes its own ice cream
in the basement.

425
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,107
Ah.

426
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:02,827
Sweet nectar of the gods.

427
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,203
What is it?

428
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:07,915
Oh!

429
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,251
The latest thing.

430
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,837
Something I brought back
from San Francisco.

431
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:16,382
Equal parts vermouth and Old Tom's gin.

432
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,551
It's called a Martinez.

433
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,428
Well, it tastes like
cherry-flavored kerosene.

434
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,598
You possess a very discerning palate, Lucy.

435
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:37,987
Do you know the history
of this type of cocktail glass?

436
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:44,827
Well, it's modeled after the glass
from which the Greek gods drank Ambrosia,

437
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:50,791
which is said to have been molded originally
from the actual breast of Aphrodite,

438
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:52,751
goddess of love.

439
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:58,966
You see that little indentation
between the bowl and the stem?

440
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:04,054
The explanation for that
is on account of the old girl's nipple.

441
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,852
Mr. Robertson...

442
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:12,980
Henry,

443
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,400
I don't see any such thing.

444
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:21,196
While it is a very pretty glass, certainly,

445
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:25,075
I believe you're suffering
from wishful thinking.

446
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,371
Are you blushing?

447
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:35,669
You weren't such a delicate flower
earlier today

448
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:39,757
when we were discussing
a certain point of female anatomy.

449
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:44,720
You're a practicing nurse.

450
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:49,725
Are you by any chance acquainted
with a phenomenon called whiplash?

451
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,520
Because I believe
I'm suffering from it right now.

452
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:59,902
Actually, I find the
sensation rather enjoyable.

453
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,344
There they are.

454
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:29,640
Now, good night, Leonard,
and good night, Ethel.

455
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:33,894
Sleep tight and don't let the bedbugs bite.

456
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,396
All right?

457
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,555
Oh my.

458
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,271
Oh my goodness.

459
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:23,027
It's been ages since we've been together

460
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:29,616
and I know that men have needs
for hygienic purposes.

461
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:33,704
Especially a man like you

462
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,165
who works so hard.

463
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:40,836
Yes, I do work hard, my dear.

464
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,053
So what's wrong?

465
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,472
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

466
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:57,227
I'm very lucky to be married to you.
Everyone says so.

467
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,734
So what's the matter?

468
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,155
I just...

469
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,207
What are you doing?

470
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:23,003
I'm afraid I have some business to attend to.

471
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,839
Now?

472
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,927
I'll be late.

473
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,638
No need to wait up.

474
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,894
Herman?

475
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,773
Oh God.

476
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,612
Oh God.

477
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:59,039
We're inferior.

478
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,377
We're condescended to.

479
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,381
We're taken for granted.

480
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,967
We're made fun of.

481
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,555
We're attacked. We're ignored.

482
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,683
We're worthless. We're a pestilence.

483
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,060
We're invisible.

484
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:27,025
That's the story of the Negro in America.

485
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:31,071
That's the tale they tell.

486
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,825
That's what they say.

487
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,416
Does what a man says matter?

488
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,213
We were born in this country,

489
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:50,757
the land of equality by birth.

490
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,593
That's what it says.

491
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,429
That's what the man says it says.

492
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,431
So again,

493
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,809
does what a man says matter?

494
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:02,519
Yes.

495
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:05,689
Do his words matter?

496
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,192
Do his laws matter?

497
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,985
- Yes.
- Yes.

498
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,278
Yes!

499
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:15,490
Because when a man's words
or laws don't matter,

500
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:19,369
that's when you have chaos,
that's when you have conflict.

501
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,622
That's when you have corruption.

502
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:27,127
When a man's words or laws don't matter,

503
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,380
forget about justice

504
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:34,509
because people don't even know
where to look to for justice.

505
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,389
So does it matter what a man says?

506
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:40,974
Yes.

507
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:55,197
The story of the Negro in America

508
00:42:56,532 --> 00:43:00,494
is the story of America.

509
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:21,682
Dr. Everett Gallinger,
may I present Dr. Samuel Reid.

510
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,476
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do?

511
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,354
We were just discussing
a most distressing problem

512
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,440
concerning mental defectives
in our community.

513
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:34,152
Your advice on the matter
would be invaluable, Everett.

514
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:36,238
- Won't you have a seat?
- Thank you.

515
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:45,747
Dr. Gallinger, I operate the idiot house
on Randall's Island.

516
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:50,085
It's a state-financed home for boys
the courts have deemed to be morons.

517
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,379
Sounds like a worthy institution.

518
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:58,176
The problem is once the boys reach manhood,
we are legally bound to release them,

519
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:04,349
which, unfortunately, leaves them free
to engender more idiots like themselves.

520
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,144
I see.

521
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:11,064
Well, gentlemen,
I believe I have a solution for you.

522
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:16,903
So then he said to her,
"Well, I'm not Mark Twain."

523
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,716
- All right, dear?
- Mmm.

524
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:40,886
Maybe a little port.

525
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:49,186
Forgive my appearance, Miss Everidge,

526
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,271
but I didn't want to miss you.

527
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:55,859
Bertie's given me clippings
of all your stories.

528
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:57,652
Oh.

529
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,364
And did you have a favorite?

530
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,910
I think it's the one
where you dined with the Red Indians.

531
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,623
I'm just glad
you came back with your scalp intact.

532
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,291
Bertie.

533
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,877
Didn't you read the clipping?

534
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,463
They were very civilized hosts.

535
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:20,342
They would never scalp a guest,
especially such a lovely one.

536
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:26,848
Bertie was telling us that Genevieve also
translated a paper for him from the Polish.

537
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:30,644
Yes, Dr. Zinberg was duly impressed.

538
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,980
A linguist as well as an adventuress.

539
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:36,817
How did you come to learn Polish?

540
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:40,570
It's my parents' native tongue.
I spoke it growing up.

541
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,364
Your parents are Polish?

542
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,199
Mmm, Galician Jews.

543
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:45,909
Oh.

544
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,747
I hope that doesn't present a problem.

545
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:53,875
After all, your savior was also a Jew.

546
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,544
There's some debate about that.

547
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,672
No, well, he was a Jew, all right.

548
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,799
You know how you can tell?

549
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:04,428
His mother thought he was a god
and he thought she was a virgin.

550
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:40,672
I hope I wasn't being too presumptuous,

551
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,175
but I saw you hiding your hands earlier.

552
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,927
It's very kind of you.

553
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:52,559
I'm afraid I haven't had the strength lately
to take proper care of myself.

554
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:58,565
Well, I could come back next week
and varnish them, if you'd like.

555
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,983
You mean paint them?

556
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,319
Good heavens.

557
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:06,656
I've never in all my life
painted my fingernails.

558
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:09,284
My mother would turn over in her grave.

559
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:16,333
You know, I don't think I've ever seen
quite such a large handbag.

560
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,921
Well, tool of the trade.

561
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,298
"Allzeit bereit," as the Germans say.

562
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,716
"Always prepared."

563
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,636
Would you like to see?

564
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,472
If you don't mind.

565
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,770
Well, my reporter's notepad
and pencil, of course.

566
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,191
Press credentials.

567
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:43,652
Um...

568
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,779
My billfold.

569
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:52,536
A lucky kachina doll,
given to me by the Hopi.

570
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,790
This is a photograph of my parents.

571
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,255
And a photograph of Bertie.

572
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:16,184
I don't know how my family's going to get on

573
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,314
when...

574
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,152
With help.

575
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,024
Well, thank you
for the best meal I've ever eaten.

576
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:07,569
Well, the first of many, I hope.

577
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,535
Whiplash.

578
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,372
An injury caused by a sudden strain
to the muscles of the neck.

579
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:45,231
Who died, Mr. Barrow?

580
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:47,901
What do you mean?

581
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:52,739
My father told me
riches and honors depend upon heaven.

582
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:53,907
Ah.

583
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:58,536
Well, I hardly knew my father.

584
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:01,915
Consider yourself fortunate.

585
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,417
Mine was a violent man and a son of a bitch.

586
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,671
Did he come here
to work on the railroad?

587
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:11,841
The California Gold Rush.

588
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:20,725
He insisted I be educated
in accordance to strict Confucian principles

589
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:24,062
in expectation of the day
he would strike it rich

590
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,314
and we would return to China.

591
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:35,490
He wouldn't even permit me to learn English
when I was still young enough to master it.

592
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:44,708
But he never struck the mother lode
and I fell in with gangsters.

593
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,962
I suppose I was
a great disappointment to him.

594
00:50:56,804 --> 00:51:00,140
Your debt to me
is now repaid in full, Mr. Barrow,

595
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:03,184
and this part of our business
has come to an end.

596
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,312
Not quite.

597
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:12,485
I'd like to discuss a remedy
to Junia's indentured state.

598
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,405
A remedy?

599
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:20,285
Do I understand you to mean
I am some kind of disease?

600
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:24,247
Forgive me. I spoke thoughtlessly.

601
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:27,625
You spoke like a man who runs a hospital.

602
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,836
$3,000.

603
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:34,758
$1,500.

604
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,009
$2,000.

605
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:37,719
Done.

606
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:39,596
Very good.

607
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:48,480
Oh.

608
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,232
I'll have the money for you shortly.

609
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:59,699
Then rest assured I will keep her safe
and gainfully employed until you do.

610
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,550
Gentlemen,

611
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:01,094
the source of addiction.

612
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,860
The place is perfect
for a man such as yourself.

613
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,778
A family man of means.

614
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:22,198
That's how you would describe yourself,
isn't it, Mr. Barrow?

615
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:23,700
Beg your pardon?

616
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:27,036
- I believe you said you have two children.
- That's right.

617
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,414
The nursery is on the ground floor

618
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:31,666
and this is the parlor,

619
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,712
a gracious stage for your wife
to entertain upon.

620
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:39,591
My wife will never see
the inside of this room, I assure you.

621
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:41,009
I'm sorry?

622
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:44,637
Nor even my kiddies.

623
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:45,722
How much?

624
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:48,308
$7,000 for two floors facing the street.

625
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:51,728
The ones facing the park are somewhat more.

626
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,730
A steal, I assure you.

627
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:58,067
Once the subway opens,
your investment will soar.

628
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:03,823
Mr. Carton?

629
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,203
Mr. Carton, can you hear me?

630
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,021
Let's get started.

631
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,611
Will you come with me, Moishe?

632
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,373
Do what the nice man tells you to do.

633
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:58,962
Your name is Moishe? You're a Yid?

634
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:00,797
Uh, yes, sir.

635
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:02,048
Very good.

636
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,717
Remove your trousers
and hop up on the table.
