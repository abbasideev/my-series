1
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,839
Hello.

2
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,680
<i>Hello. Am I speaking
to Mr. Philip Connarthy?</i>

3
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,880
It's pronounced "Connarty."

4
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,360
<i>Apologies. I'm calling on
behalf of a Miss Kelly Royce.</i>

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,679
I don't know a Kelly Royce.

6
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,359
<i>Absolutely, but this regards
Miss Royce's mother, Carol Royce.</i>

7
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,600
I don't know a
Carol Royce either.

8
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,880
<i>Her maiden name was
Hartman. Carol Hartman.</i>

9
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,720
Yeah, I know the name.

10
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
Um...

11
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,720
I knew her. Uh, sorry,
why are you calling?

12
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,960
<i>I'm afraid she passed
away last Wednesday.</i>

13
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,880
<i>Her daughter wanted you to know.</i>

14
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
<i>Hello?</i>

15
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,959
- Tell her I'm sorry for her loss. Uh...
<i>- Of course.</i>

16
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,520
Thank you for letting me know.

17
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,400
<i>There will, of course, be a
funeral. In London. In England.</i>

18
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,400
In England.

19
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,800
No, um, I can't. Uh...

20
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,679
<i>No, that's understood.</i>

21
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,520
<i>I'm not calling about attendance.
I'm from a company called Eulogy.</i>

22
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,639
Eulogy, okay.

23
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,840
<i>We're helping the family
curate an immersive memorial.</i>

24
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,199
Immersive memorial. Mm-hmm.

25
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,839
<i>We've been contacting names
in her mother's old papers,</i>

26
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,479
<i>which is where you were listed.</i>

27
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,559
<i>Locating people who knew Carol in
her youth has been challenging.</i>

28
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,119
<i>If you could contribute a memory, it
would mean a great deal to the family.</i>

29
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,399
- It was all so long ago, and I can't, um...
<i>- Well, you won't have to write anything.</i>

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,160
<i>The system curates your recollections
and uploads them for the memorial.</i>

31
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,239
<i>- Would you like to take part?</i>
- I'm not sure.

32
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,919
<i>It's entirely voluntary.</i>

33
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,280
<i>If it's easier, we can just send you
the kit, and you can decide then.</i>

34
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,759
The kit?

35
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,160
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Ah!

36
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,920
<i>Hello?</i>

37
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,199
Hello?

38
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,839
<i>You don't have to speak directly into
me. Sorry. I know, weird thing to say.</i>

39
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,919
Sorry.

40
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,479
<i>I've got a bit of an opening
spiel I need to do here.</i>

41
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,000
- Go for it.
- <i>Okay.</i>

42
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,199
<i>Today, we celebrate the
life of Carol Royce.</i>

43
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,759
<i>As guide, my role is to
help you reminisce, relive,</i>

44
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,119
<i>and to curate your
fondest memories of her.</i>

45
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,479
Yeah, can we maybe skip the intro?
Just tell me what you need me to do.

46
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,639
<i>Okay. Uh...</i>

47
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,399
<i>So first, let's,
um... let's calibrate.</i>

48
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,519
<i>Simply place the guide disc,
uh, that's me, on your temple.</i>

49
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,399
- This, like, on the side of my, like...
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

50
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,640
<i>That's it.</i>

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,519
<i>Now all you have to
do is think of Carol.</i>

52
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,719
Well, I haven't done
that for a long time.

53
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,120
<i>Mm-hmm. Understood.</i>

54
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,560
<i>But try to recall her now.</i>

55
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,999
<i>Close your eyes and
picture her face.</i>

56
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,719
<i>Okay, uh, not really
getting anything.</i>

57
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,919
Oh, well... sorry, but, um...

58
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,359
<i>Just, uh... just try to focus.</i>

59
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,520
I am, but it's hard to, uh...

60
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,360
<i>To see her clearly?</i>

61
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,999
Yes.

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,799
<i>At first, getting
hold of a memory</i>

63
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,679
<i>feels like trying to grab
a river with your hands.</i>

64
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,799
- Oh boy.
<i>- Yeah, sorry, not my words.</i>

65
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,039
<i>That's what the,
uh, brochure says.</i>

66
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,799
<i>What helps are tangible prompts.</i>

67
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,199
<i>Photos, songs, mementos.
That kind of thing.</i>

68
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,559
Can't you supply photos?

69
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,279
<i>Oh, I'm not allowed to
provide external material.</i>

70
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,279
<i>- It would get mixed up with your memories.</i>
- Right.

71
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,839
<i>They do it this way to keep
the recollections accurate.</i>

72
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,759
Right, right, right.

73
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,319
<i>But if you grant access
to your photo cloud,</i>

74
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,919
<i>I can search for
images of Carol.</i>

75
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,079
Smartphones and clouds didn't
exist back when I knew her.

76
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,840
<i>Um, okay, but do you
have any physical photos?</i>

77
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,999
- Are you there?
<i>- Yeah, did you find some?</i>

78
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,520
- Uh, a few.
<i>- A few?</i>

79
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,519
Okay, three.

80
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,679
<i>- I can process up to 1,500 photos.</i>
- And I got you three.

81
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,800
<i>They recommend a minimum
of six different images.</i>

82
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,480
- Can we just get going?
<i>- Absolutely.</i>

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,799
- So?
<i>- So pop me back on.</i>

84
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,160
<i>Lay out the first image you'd like
to import and then look at it.</i>

85
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,559
- Literally just look at it?
<i>- That's right.</i>

86
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,439
Okay. Uh, the first
one is, uh... this.

87
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,239
<i>Okay. What are we
looking at here?</i>

88
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,959
That's the day I met Carol.
This would've been in Brooklyn.

89
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,919
Rooftop barbecue at The Coop.

90
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,840
<i>- The Coop?</i>
- Uh, yeah. It used to be a squat. Um...

91
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,160
The idea was it was a co-op, so everyone
just called it Coop, hence The Coop.

92
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,559
I mean, we were
just kids, really,

93
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,720
but we called ourselves
artists, musicians... misfits.

94
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,920
Well, believe it or not, that, yeah,
that young man is me, and that is Carol.

95
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,599
<i>What, the... the woman
with her back to us?</i>

96
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,839
Yeah.

97
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,319
<i>We're looking for a clear
recollection of her.</i>

98
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,519
This is what I have.

99
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,080
<i>We can enhance the moment
by entering the image.</i>

100
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,079
<i>Shall we go in?</i>

101
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,640
- What do you mean "go in"?
<i>- It's easiest to just show you.</i>

102
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,839
Jesus Christ.

103
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,479
- Hi. Sorry.
- Ah!

104
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,240
- Oh.
- It's me.

105
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,039
- Your guide.
- Holy crap.

106
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,999
I didn't... didn't
mean to make you jump.

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,799
No, it... it's not...
It's just that this is...

108
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,680
Yeah. Take a moment
to get your bearings.

109
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,240
This is the photograph
fused with your memories.

110
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,839
Some parts are missing,

111
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,880
but details appear as and
when your memories fill out.

112
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,399
So when this was taken, this was
before you and Carol got together?

113
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,639
Huh...

114
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,799
Well, I never said
we got together.

115
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,120
Oh, come on. Look at the
way you're looking at her.

116
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,879
And I'm guessing she was looking
back at you the same way.

117
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,640
I'd made her laugh.

118
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,399
She was new in the house.

119
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,599
I didn't know her,
but I wanted to,

120
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,160
and I'd made her laugh,

121
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,880
and she looked...

122
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,879
- Oh Christ.
- It's okay.

123
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,039
No, there's no... Um,
I can't see her face.

124
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,399
It'll come to you.

125
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,759
Try to focus on what you
can recall of this moment.

126
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Okay.

127
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Um...

128
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,520
She had just moved in. Uh...

129
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,959
She kept to herself. She
had been studying the cello.

130
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,760
She was usually in
her room, practicing.

131
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,999
I think she still had a boyfriend
back home at this point.

132
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,080
Fiancé.

133
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,479
Sorry?

134
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,519
There's an engagement
ring on her finger. See?

135
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,399
The eye can't make that level
of detail out in your photo,

136
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,519
but there's enough for the algorithmic
sharpening to make visible to us in here.

137
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,439
I never knew she was engaged.

138
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,239
Maybe you chose not to
see or not to remember.

139
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,399
No, she never said
it was that serious.

140
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,120
Perhaps she underplayed it.

141
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,360
- Didn't wanna scare you off.
- Uh-huh.

142
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,200
Shall we mark this moment for
potential upload for the memorial?

143
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,879
I don't think her family would
appreciate seeing a fond memory

144
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,199
of her flirting with me while
engaged to someone else.

145
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,439
Hmm, you're right.

146
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,040
Though it would be an honest
representation of her character.

147
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
Shall we move on?

148
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,800
Jesus Christ.

149
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,280
<i>Yeah. Don't worry.</i>

150
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,960
<i>These transitions should get
less disorientating as you go.</i>

151
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,440
<i>Shall we try your next photo?</i>

152
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
Okay.

153
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,759
<i>Looks like another party.</i>

154
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,039
Uh, yeah, I can't remember what
for. Any excuse would do, you know?

155
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,199
That was The Coop.

156
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,040
<i>Okay. A lot of faces. Why don't
you talk me through who's who?</i>

157
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,600
Uh, okay.

158
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,479
That's Emma with
the blonde hair.

159
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,240
And the guy with
the bong, that's Jamo.

160
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,440
And the girl lying
back there is Amanda.

161
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,880
You'd have liked her. She
was British, like you.

162
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,080
But there's no Carol.

163
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,760
Or you.

164
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,960
No, we're not in the photo, but we
were definitely both at this party.

165
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Mm.

166
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,079
Looks like there was a record
playing. "Fools Gold" by...

167
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,560
The Stone Roses.

168
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,640
It's one of Amanda's.

169
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,719
Music's great for
jogging the memory.

170
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
There.

171
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
Right.

172
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
Yeah.

173
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,720
We were through there,

174
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,720
down the hall.

175
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,360
That was the first time me
and Carol really got talking.

176
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,720
I was so nervous.

177
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,120
My brain was screaming behind my
ears, "Don't fuck this up, man."

178
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,480
But I didn't fuck it up.

179
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,080
Talking with her was easy.

180
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,280
She was funny.

181
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,760
Can you remember what
you talked about?

182
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,560
No, but

183
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
she was like no
one I'd ever known.

184
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,840
Or even thought of knowing.

185
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,840
That was our first
night together.

186
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,079
I can't use this either, can I?

187
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,040
"I screwed the deceased.
May she rest in peace."

188
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
Probably not.

189
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
<i>Um, let's try your last photo.</i>

190
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,280
Uh...

191
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,679
Me again.

192
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,399
What the hell was I wearing?

193
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,839
Don't have a clue who took this.
I didn't notice anyone taking it.

194
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,359
<i>But still no sign of Carol.</i>

195
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,919
No. But I was listening...

196
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
...to her.

197
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,920
She was in her room.

198
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,040
On her cello, practicing.

199
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Lost in it.

200
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,880
She didn't know I was watching.

201
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,160
- She's in there, but I can't see her.
- Can you remember what she was playing?

202
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,559
This thing she used to play over and
over. It was a beautiful piece of music.

203
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,480
If you can remember the name
of the piece, I can look it up.

204
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,960
Listening might
fill out the memory.

205
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,000
No, it won't be on a service.

206
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,360
She wrote it herself.

207
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,719
It was a piece she composed?

208
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,640
Yeah. She was good.

209
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,680
She was good.

210
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,399
<i>It's a shame you don't have more
photos, but since that's all you have,</i>

211
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,599
<i>perhaps we should try some
other form of stimuli...</i>

212
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
It's not.

213
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
<i>Sorry?</i>

214
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,240
I've got other pictures.

215
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,159
Of her.

216
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,400
<i>Great! Then let's look at those.</i>

217
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,040
They won't help.

218
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,560
See what I mean?

219
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
<i>Yeah.</i>

220
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,639
A year or so after we broke up,

221
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,079
if it had her face in it, I
either threw it out or I did that.

222
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,999
<i>You were upset with her.</i>

223
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,960
That's one way of
putting it, yeah.

224
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,959
You won't ever know how
hard I fell for that girl.

225
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,000
Like, beyond everything.

226
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,559
And she said... she always
said she felt the same,

227
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,720
and I believed
she felt the same,

228
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,840
and then she drops me.

229
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,559
Into a pit. Just a fucking pit.

230
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,959
Just cold, bang.

231
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,480
Just, "See ya."

232
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,640
Not a word. Just walks away.

233
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,759
And she went on with her
life while mine just stopped.

234
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,599
So that was me.

235
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,200
Lost. No hope. Nothing.

236
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,480
So then came the drinking,
all that shit, the desperation of it.

237
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,840
The fucking shame.

238
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,599
Me and Carol were
together three years.

239
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,439
It took me 15 to climb out
of the hole she put me in.

240
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,560
- So, yes. I was upset.
<i>- And you never stayed in touch?</i>

241
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,199
Uh, no.

242
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,280
No, we did not.

243
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,959
<i>Reexamining the past isn't
always comfortable, but...</i>

244
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,719
Okay, sorry.

245
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,120
But, yeah,

246
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,759
there were good times...
when we were together.

247
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,720
I know that. But, uh...

248
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,120
that's all gone.

249
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,400
I can't even picture
her face anymore.

250
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,999
<i>Do you want to stop?</i>

251
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
No.

252
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,479
<i>Well, do you have any
particular memories</i>

253
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,959
<i>associated with what's
left of these photos?</i>

254
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,440
I don't... Um...

255
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,839
Used to, maybe? I don't know.

256
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,679
<i>It's just the more
you can recall,</i>

257
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,240
<i>the more likely it is we can
restore your memory of her face.</i>

258
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,760
All right, then. Let's...
let's try this one.

259
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,399
<i>Which one's you?</i>

260
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,959
<i>Sorry, I'm joking.</i>

261
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,359
Oh, you're hilarious.

262
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,719
<i>What do you remember about
the day this was taken?</i>

263
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,719
It was wet.

264
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,119
<i>Well, that's a start.</i>

265
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,200
<i>Let's see what else
you can recall.</i>

266
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,319
So where
exactly are we?

267
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,039
Uh, the pier at Cape Cod.

268
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,119
Well, that's where you live now.

269
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,119
Yeah, well, I inherited my folks'
house, but they were out of town,

270
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,760
so we took the opportunity to
take a cheap little vacation.

271
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,000
My first getaway
with a girlfriend.

272
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,400
Who took the photo?

273
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,479
Uh, just a tourist.

274
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,440
Some passerby we handed
the camera to and asked.

275
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,399
I liked this photo
more than Carol did.

276
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,400
- She wasn't into hot dogs?
- No, it was the beer.

277
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,239
"You could've put that
bottle down for the picture."

278
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,279
Well,
yeah. She had a point.

279
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,360
Yeah.

280
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,720
You know, it was on this trip
that we knew we were serious.

281
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,080
Lying in bed, fascinated
by each other's eyes.

282
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,759
"I love you" back
and forth, all that.

283
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,000
Nothing else existed. Just us.

284
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,840
That's all we needed.

285
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,120
We made plans.

286
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,680
Man, we were so young.

287
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,079
<i>So what were the plans?</i>

288
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,039
Well, we decided to get
our own place together.

289
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,000
<i>Oh, black and white?
That's a bit arty.</i>

290
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,320
This was it. Tiny
place over a piano store.

291
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,199
Uh, I took the picture, so I
would have been about there.

292
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,360
Mm.

293
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,440
Can you remember what color
she's painting with here?

294
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,199
The walls were
nicotine-yellow when we moved in.

295
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,960
First place of our
own for both of us.

296
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,120
We wanted to make our mark, so we
painted the whole place... blue.

297
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,640
Yeah,
that's it. Blue.

298
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,719
Yes!

299
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,280
Oh my God, the landlord lost his shit.
We weren't supposed to redecorate.

300
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,919
It was a stupid idea, really.

301
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,559
It made it look even
smaller than it already was.

302
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,000
- The two of you were happy here?
- Mm-hmm.

303
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,640
Just me and her.

304
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,360
And the cello.

305
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,680
Yeah, we both kept up the music.
She'd joined the band by now.

306
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,320
- You were in a band together?
- Oh yeah. I'll show you.

307
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,359
Here, it's one of our gigs.

308
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,280
It's about... '91, I think.

309
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,280
I stabbed it with a pen.

310
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,359
Will it still work?

311
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,479
<i>Should do.</i>

312
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,720
There we are.

313
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,679
So Carol played keyboards?

314
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,359
Yeah, that was my idea.

315
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
Not cello?

316
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,080
Cello wouldn't have
fitted our sound.

317
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,319
You could adapt the sound.

318
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,479
She could play anything.

319
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,839
It might not have been the
cello, but she was fine with it.

320
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,200
She told you that?

321
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,719
Sorry, it's not a trial.

322
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,920
No, it's not.

323
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,319
We were getting
quite a following.

324
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,600
I'm not saying we were a big
deal, but maybe we could've been.

325
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,119
Have you got a recording? It might
bring back more of the moment.

326
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,679
Not anymore, no.

327
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,560
Zeke quit the band, moved to
Seattle, decided he was God,

328
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,719
and that was it for us.

329
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,520
So, no, no recording.

330
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,159
It's just as well.

331
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,599
Hearing his voice gives
me hives, to be honest.

332
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,759
He went on to become
a big deal, didn't he?

333
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah, well, assholes prosper.

334
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,080
Maybe we could've kept
going without him, but

335
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,560
Carol's heart wasn't in it.

336
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,039
- Maybe you should have let her play cello.
- Maybe you could say "cello" again.

337
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,199
- Well, the cello was important to her.
- I know.

338
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,839
She played it her whole life.
Taught her daughter to play it.

339
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,680
Are you supposed to be mildly
annoying? Is that how they coded you?

340
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,040
I wasn't really coded.

341
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,759
- More generated.
- Okay.

342
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,000
Generated from some
digital asshole.

343
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
Sorry.

344
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,600
Apology accepted.

345
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,200
Let's try another picture.

346
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,639
Okay, so these are
definitely all '91.

347
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,439
- Halloween at the Undervault.
- <i>Oh, this is good.</i>

348
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,040
<i>With multiple photos, we'll get
a composite of the entire night.</i>

349
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,759
Yeah, Jamo
took a whole bunch.

350
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,640
Wild night. A lot of
drinking. And I mean <i>a lot.</i>

351
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,599
Jesus, that's Carol in red there. I
was so mad, I used a cigarette on this.

352
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,639
- You burned your own face out too?
- That's not me.

353
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,759
That's me in the hockey mask.

354
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,519
I had the bar job by now.

355
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,839
So who's Beetlejuice?

356
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,440
Just some dickbag trying
his luck with my girlfriend.

357
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,319
Even though you're standing right there
dressed like Jason from <i>Friday the 13th</i>?

358
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,200
Exactly. I was that close, and
she still just sat with this guy.

359
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,719
Right in front of me.

360
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,839
Looks like
you had company too.

361
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,920
Who's she?

362
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,519
Oh, that's Emma.

363
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,879
She was in The Coop
photos earlier.

364
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,560
Yeah, she
worked there too.

365
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,880
The two of you get on?

366
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,480
We worked together.

367
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,960
Oh Jesus. Not you too.

368
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,599
Carol thought I encouraged
her, which I didn't.

369
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,759
It was a bar job, for Christ's sake.
You joke around. You know?

370
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,240
So she was jealous?

371
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,359
We fought about it that night.

372
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,880
I was pissed she'd been sitting
all night with Mr. Asshole.

373
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Looks like she wants
to get away from him.

374
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,440
What?

375
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,200
She's leaning back,
like his breath smells.

376
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,479
Okay, that's one snapshot.

377
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,559
Believe me, she
could've moved anytime.

378
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,839
- She was there the whole night with him.
- The whole night?

379
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,000
Absolutely.

380
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,359
I think so.

381
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,879
See that area?

382
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,759
Jamo must've photographed it
at some other point that night.

383
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,320
Isn't that Carol with
her back to us in red?

384
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,360
Okay, not the whole
night, literally.

385
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,680
It was just a stupid fight.

386
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,639
She went on and on,

387
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,879
and then she blamed me that
she didn't get an early night

388
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,599
'cause she had some audition
tryout thing the next day.

389
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,080
Brooklyn Philharmonic.

390
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,039
For the cello.

391
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,279
And she didn't get it.

392
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,199
She must've been sad about that.

393
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,839
Not for long.

394
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,040
It opened the door to
other things for her.

395
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,599
When the orchestra gig didn't
work out, she was bummed.

396
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,160
She didn't have any work.

397
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,199
But then Amanda, the
British girl from The Coop,

398
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,800
she'd moved back home,

399
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,079
pulled a couple of strings.

400
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,879
Got Carol a six-month placement

401
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,319
in the orchestra pit for <i>Phantom
of the Opera,</i> of all things.

402
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,920
London's West End.

403
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,040
Total tourist bullshit, but

404
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,759
she was excited.

405
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,239
Yes, she was.

406
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,760
<i>You didn't want her to go?</i>

407
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,200
Oh, she kept saying, "It's
just for a few months," but

408
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,160
it's easy to say that when you're
the one going on an adventure.

409
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,919
She sent me a
postcard every week.

410
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,320
Upbeat, but saying
she missed me.

411
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,679
Little poems and such.

412
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,159
<i>Maybe we could scan
in one of the...</i>

413
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,920
<i>- Oh.</i>
- I was thorough.

414
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,639
<i>So you didn't see
her for a while?</i>

415
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,479
No, but we arranged for me
to fly out there in the fall,

416
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,280
see her for a long weekend, but

417
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,640
it felt so far away, you know?

418
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,800
A long time on my own.

419
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,920
<i>What's this?</i>

420
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,720
My birthday.

421
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,279
<i>So you weren't alone the
whole time she was gone.</i>

422
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,279
What do you mean?

423
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,280
<i>Well, someone took this photo.</i>

424
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,839
So that's...

425
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,120
Emma.

426
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,800
Oh God, yeah.

427
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Uh...

428
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
Oh Christ, yeah.

429
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,679
Um, don't look at me like that.

430
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,479
- Like what?
- Like you are.

431
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,439
I'm not looking at
you like anything.

432
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,519
Okay, so it was my birthday.

433
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,119
I had a few drinks at work.

434
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,119
Uh, not my idea. They were
practically forcing shots on me.

435
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,039
Sure.

436
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,479
And Emma came back to the
apartment, and, you know...

437
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,239
Uh, we weren't...

438
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,239
It was
a dumb thing, okay?

439
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,480
It was just a one-off thing.

440
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,879
I mean, we'd... we'd have just
regretted it, me and Emma, in secret.

441
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,519
It wouldn't have been a
big fucking deal if...

442
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,679
If what?

443
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,839
I mean, Carol never called.

444
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,239
Couldn't afford to.

445
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,839
Long distance back then was a fortune.

446
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,519
But this night,

447
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,119
she gets up early and called
to sing me "Happy Birthday,"

448
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,119
and Emma answers the call.

449
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,320
I don't know why.

450
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,680
- Making mischief?
- Yeah, I don't know, maybe.

451
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,120
Anyhow, shit hit the fan.

452
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,599
Me and Carol screaming at
each other down the line.

453
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,520
She yelled all kinds of shit. I
yelled all kinds of shit back.

454
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,480
Just ugly, scorched-earth stuff.

455
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
Ugly.

456
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,719
She hung up on me.

457
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,239
Or I hung up on her.

458
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,680
I don't know. I can't
fucking remember.

459
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,640
But, yeah, anyway,

460
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
not good.

461
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,880
Do you want to mark this memory for
potential upload? For the memorial?

462
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,759
I never said I was perfect.

463
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,119
You've said a lot
about Carol's failings.

464
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,839
"She did this, she did that,
she's the root of all evil."

465
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,839
Okay, you
don't understand.

466
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,239
What did she do that was
so awful, so heinous,

467
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,439
you become this wounded dog?

468
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,240
I haven't shown you yet.

469
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,959
You remember I told you we
arranged for me to fly out there?

470
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,919
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- I already had my ticket, so...

471
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,079
<i>- So Carol knew you were coming.
- </i> Right.

472
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,160
A few months or so
after my birthday.

473
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,919
Now, she was staying in this
British family's spare room

474
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,119
in the sticks somewhere,

475
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,840
so I booked us a stupid suite in a
hotel I couldn't afford.

476
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,439
Big romantic.

477
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,879
<i>Nice.</i>

478
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,360
I went to the matinee.

479
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,320
Not my thing, and I couldn't
even see her, of course.

480
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,640
She was in the pit somewhere, but...
I met her at the stage door after.

481
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,039
I took her suitcase
back to the hotel,

482
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,080
and...

483
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,039
we went out for dinner.

484
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
<i>Anywhere nice?</i>

485
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,039
To a fancy restaurant.

486
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,320
I'd read this article
about it on the flight.

487
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,040
When I landed, I called to see
if they had a table for two.

488
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,359
I think they bumped someone when
I told them what I was gonna do.

489
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,520
<i>What do you mean?</i>

490
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,880
We were over here.

491
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,600
So walk through what happened.

492
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,640
Well, uh...

493
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,240
she looked kind of the
same but different.

494
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,479
She said she'd put on weight,
but I couldn't see that.

495
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,160
I thought she looked beautiful.

496
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,919
And I ordered a bottle of champagne.
First time I'd done that anywhere.

497
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,320
But she didn't touch it. She
didn't wanna drink anything.

498
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,119
And I was like, "Come on."
"I've come all this way. Have one."

499
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,200
But no.

500
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,960
So I had to bite my tongue because,
you know, it was irritating.

501
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,159
I had the ring in my
pocket, so I was nervous.

502
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,439
I'm draining the glasses.

503
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,719
And, finally, I
pluck up the nerve,

504
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,640
and I take out the ring,
and I almost dropped it.

505
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,440
I was so jittery.

506
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,400
And she looks at it, and...

507
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,960
she goes quiet.

508
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,599
She doesn't say anything.

509
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,560
She doesn't even look at me.

510
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,559
And now the waitresses
are shooting looks over

511
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,239
'cause they know I'm there to
propose, so I'm on display, you know?

512
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,319
My cheeks are burning. My throat
is dry, so I'm drinking more.

513
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,040
And then, in the end, I just...
I ask her, "Just say something."

514
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,840
"Say anything."

515
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,079
And she's just
staring at the floor,

516
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,519
so I bang the
table with my fist,

517
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,240
and now everybody's watching,

518
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,320
and she just gets up...

519
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,600
and walks out.

520
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,280
There's just silence. There's
just the clanging in the kitchen.

521
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,320
And I'm there, and

522
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,919
everyone's quiet, the staff
can't make eye contact,

523
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,600
just this stink of
humiliation on me.

524
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,560
So I sat there, and I
finished that bottle.

525
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,159
They told me I didn't have to pay
for it, but I insisted I would.

526
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,560
- I didn't want their pity.
- No, because you could provide your own.

527
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,080
What?

528
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,280
You're talking a lot
about how sad <i>you</i> were.

529
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,359
I was destroyed.

530
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,679
And how was she?

531
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,479
I'm not saying that she was a
big, happy fucking sandwich,

532
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,399
but she walked out on me.

533
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,559
Not a word as to why.

534
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,719
Would you have listened if she told
you? A bottle of champagne down.

535
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,240
- Of course.
- So why do you think she left?

536
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,160
Maybe she was cheating.

537
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,120
Maybe she was sick of
me. Maybe she was cruel.

538
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,839
She... she knew that I was coming.
She could have ended it on the phone.

539
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,959
She made me fly all
that way. She knew...

540
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,359
But not that you were
coming to propose.

541
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,160
Like that's a big difference.

542
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,239
You said this was autumn '92?

543
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,839
Fall, yes, like October.

544
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,440
She looked sort of
different. Wouldn't drink.

545
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,800
She was pregnant.

546
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,920
With me.

547
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,320
Kelly Royce.

548
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,280
Carol's daughter.

549
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,000
The one she taught
to play cello.

550
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,920
Don't worry. You're not my dad.

551
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,879
He was a one-night stand.

552
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,600
Played xylophone in the
orchestra, believe it or not.

553
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,279
You're Carol's daughter?

554
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,480
Yes. Well, kind of.

555
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
I'm not real.

556
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,079
I'm a disposable avatar.

557
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,360
A temp guide. An echo, really.

558
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,959
I'm programmed with her
thoughts and opinions

559
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,159
so I can decide what
she'd like to include

560
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,839
without her having to be
exposed to everything herself,

561
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,960
which, as you can imagine,

562
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,999
might be upsetting.

563
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,520
Why didn't you say?

564
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,280
You said, "Skip the intro."

565
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,119
So you know everything that
the real daughter knows?

566
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,479
Mm-hmm. More or less.

567
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,839
So you already knew everything
I've been telling you here.

568
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,799
Well, some of it,

569
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,400
but, to be honest, she never really
spoke much about this time in her life.

570
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,999
- Right.
- I think looking back was painful for her.

571
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,759
It doesn't mean your time
together wasn't meaningful.

572
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,800
- Probably the opposite.
- Mm.

573
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,879
This guy, your dad.

574
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,239
- What was he like? I just wanna know.
- Why?

575
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,999
- She cheated with him.
- You mean, followed your lead?

576
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,600
Could you just tell me?

577
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,959
I never knew much about
him. He was called Brian.

578
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,599
- Brian?
- Yeah.

579
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,199
And they were never together.

580
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,799
And by the time I was
born, he was in Manchester.

581
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,199
I saw him maybe
five or six times.

582
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,559
And the last time, he was ranting about
some online rabbit-hole conspiracy theory.

583
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,119
And the year after that,
I heard he died of Covid.

584
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,360
Oh boy.

585
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,079
He sounds like a real catch.

586
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,519
Great choice, Carol.

587
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,320
Great choice.

588
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Sorry.

589
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,880
It's okay.

590
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,200
She'd agree.

591
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,759
She said she wrote to you to explain
or at least start the conversation,

592
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,999
and you never replied.

593
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,039
- She never wrote to me.
- It's what she told me.

594
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,079
She never wrote!

595
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,239
Or I never got it.
I... I didn't get it.

596
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,919
I'd have listened.

597
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,839
Yeah, and said, "Get rid of it."

598
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,999
No! I don't know.
We'd have talked it over.

599
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,759
- And you'd have heard her?
- Yes, I would! Yes, I would!

600
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,640
I wanna get out of here.

601
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,039
I just wanna see her, you know?

602
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,799
<i>Maybe there's something else
that could jog your memory?</i>

603
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,039
I don't know.

604
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,359
<i>Well, um, what
about in that box?</i>

605
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,959
<i>Is that, like, a camera there?</i>

606
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,599
- This?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

607
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,640
It's a
disposable camera.

608
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
Big in the '90s. I
got it at the airport.

609
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,759
The plan was we would take
photos around the city together.

610
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,120
That never happened,
of course. We never...

611
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,840
Here.

612
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,760
- I haven't seen one of these in forever.
- Can you still process it?

613
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,720
- There's only one photo been taken.
- I know, I know, I know.

614
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,680
- I'll have to wind it on.
- Okay.

615
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,400
- You'll waste the rest of the film.
- But you can retrieve the one photo?

616
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,919
Might take a while.

617
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,479
I'll wait.

618
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,000
Matte or gloss?

619
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Matte.

620
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,400
<i>So?</i>

621
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,920
<i>Was there anything on it?</i>

622
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,959
Here.

623
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,319
I think I took this.
Just a nothing photo.

624
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
<i>Oh.</i>

625
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,119
<i>Look, we could still go in.</i>

626
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,799
What's the point?

627
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,199
<i>Well, you took it on your trip,
so it might give us something.</i>

628
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,119
Sure.

629
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,560
Told you. It's nothing.

630
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,279
This was the hotel room.

631
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,679
When I came back from the
restaurant, her case was gone,

632
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,920
so I knew that was that.

633
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,000
And I took it out on the room.

634
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,960
It was pathetic.

635
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,360
What are you even looking for?

636
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,440
I just want to see
what your camera picked up.

637
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,200
There's a note here.

638
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,079
It says "Philly."

639
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,919
System sharpened it up.

640
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,999
There's a piece of paper
with "Philly" written on it.

641
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,599
- That's what she called me.
- I'm pretty sure it's her writing.

642
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,719
Well, I... I never saw that.

643
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,999
No, Philip, it's just part of an image.

644
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,119
- You...
- Oh, come on.

645
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,639
You won't be able to pick it up. I'm
sorry. That's just not how it works.

646
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,720
No, come on.

647
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,120
Please, come on.

648
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,080
Get me out of here.

649
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,519
<i>Maybe you kept it somewhere.</i>

650
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,159
- No.
<i>- Are you sure?</i>

651
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,760
I'd fucking remember.

652
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,200
Sorry.

653
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,880
<i>It's okay.</i>

654
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,200
<i>Let's just walk through what you
did after you took the photo.</i>

655
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,400
Um...

656
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,240
I just smashed
the room up. Uh...

657
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,280
I went out, drank
myself into a blur.

658
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,879
And when I got back,

659
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,599
the maid had cleaned the place
up, put it all in a little pile.

660
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,239
I just packed everything up,

661
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,079
I... I put it away,
and I never...

662
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
Uh...

663
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,840
<i>Philly, I have
to tell you something.</i>

664
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,039
<i>I couldn't say earlier. I froze.</i>

665
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,120
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

666
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,600
<i>Please... please don't hate me.</i>

667
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,960
<i>That day I rang and
got Emma, I was so mad.</i>

668
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,960
<i>I had a one-night stand with
someone in the orchestra here.</i>

669
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,560
<i>It didn't mean
anything, and I'm sorry.</i>

670
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,360
<i>I've missed my period.</i>

671
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,880
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

672
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,800
<i>I love you, and I want us to work,
but I don't know how you'll feel.</i>

673
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,960
<i>I think I wanna keep the baby.</i>

674
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,880
<i>I don't know.</i>

675
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,240
<i>But could you live
with that if I did?</i>

676
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,839
<i>If you still wanna talk,</i>

677
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,160
<i>meet me tomorrow afternoon at the
stage door, after the matinee.</i>

678
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,600
<i>I'll understand if you
never wanna see me again.</i>

679
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
<i>I hope you do.</i>

680
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,840
<i>I love you,</i>

681
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,080
<i>Carol.</i>

682
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,680
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

683
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,679
<i>Okay, Philly.</i>

684
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,840
<i>So you asked me to record
this piece of music for you.</i>

685
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,280
<i>Careful
what you wish for.</i>

686
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,440
Let's see her.
