00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,319
<i>Keyworth Pictures
invites you to Hotel Reverie.</i>

2
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,319
<i>Renowned Dr. Alex Palmer</i>

3
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,119
<i>encounters tragic
heiress Clara Ryce.</i>

4
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,359
<i>Waiter, another scotch, please.</i>

5
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,000
- And for yourself?
- Thank you. A Black Rose.

6
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,680
A rose for a rose.

7
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,119
A piano standing silent
always makes me so melancholy.

8
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,319
It's silly, I know.

9
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,720
If it's "Clair de Lune" you want,
it's "Clair de Lune" you shall have.

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,439
<i>Yet, even as
their affection grows,</i>

11
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,519
<i>the pair are unaware</i>

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,239
<i>Clara's fiendish husband,
Claude, is plotting her death.</i>

13
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,679
My accursed wife has more
lives than a damn cat.

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,439
She dies tonight.

15
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,359
Don't move.

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,519
Oh my goodness!

17
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,120
Your studio, Keyworth Pictures,
has the most incredible back catalog.

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,239
Noir thrillers,

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,519
wartime romances,
caper comedies.

20
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,159
An unrivaled collection
of heritage media.

21
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,359
By "heritage," you mean old.

22
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,920
I mean, uh, vintage.

23
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,439
You have a great reputation.

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,919
Fifty years ago, yes.

25
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,279
Look, I know you're trying
to blow smoke up my arse,

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,519
but let's be real.

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,119
My stages are empty. We're
up to our knockers in debt.

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,639
I was in Cannes last week

29
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,960
trying to sell our library to
some streamers, and they were NFI.

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,159
NFI? That's a non-fungible...

31
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,520
Not fucking interested.

32
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,839
The Keyworth brand
is not what it was.

33
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,159
We're going under, and
everybody knows it.

34
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,319
Well, I believe with
your prestige content...

35
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,199
Please don't call it
content. Makes me heave.

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,599
Okay. Okay.

37
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,319
I'm... I'm sorry.

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,600
Prestige movies.

39
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,199
Dreams. Classics.

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,639
Like <i>Hotel Reverie.</i>

41
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,680
"I'll be yours forevermore."

42
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,199
My father's favorite.

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
And mine.

44
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,479
But try telling
that to the public.

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,239
- I think you'll find them...
- NFI.

46
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,239
Well, you know,

47
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,519
what's the point of watching an
old movie starring Ralph Redwell

48
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,799
when you could watch a new movie
starring Ryan Gosling or Ryan...

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,719
Reynolds?

50
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,040
Yeah. But they're way
out of my price league.

51
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,919
Well, what if I told you

52
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,679
my company has an affordable way

53
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,359
to take a shuttered
classic, like <i>Hotel Reverie,</i>

54
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,879
and almost instantly recast the lead
with a contemporary Hollywood star?

55
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,279
- We can't...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

56
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,480
Who you will be able to afford

57
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,039
because you'll only need
96 minutes of their time.

58
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,039
You're gonna use one
of those AI paint boxes

59
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,039
and deepfake Ryan over Ralph...

60
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,759
What we're proposing isn't fake.

61
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,640
It's real.

62
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,599
Oh, you've intrigued me.

63
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
So which Ryan are
we calling first?

64
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,439
<i>Hey, Brandy.</i>

65
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,479
<i>Listen, the studio are chasing.</i>

66
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,279
<i>I'm telling you, I just love
this project for you right now.</i>

67
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,359
<i>We all do.</i>

68
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,479
<i>And, hey, the money
is off the chart.</i>

69
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,080
<i>Call me when you get a
chance. Bye now. Bye-bye.</i>

70
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,079
No.

71
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,119
Whoa now. Did you read the material?
Lola's in almost every scene.

72
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,719
- It's a big role.
- It's a big supporting role.

73
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,159
Backing up Mr. "Lead
Dude" again.

74
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,480
Hey.

75
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,159
You get lead roles.

76
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,839
Yeah, for Sundance misery porn.

77
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,839
You don't want those
roles anymore either?

78
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,719
I'm saying I'm tired of
my only available options

79
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,079
being noble victim
or fuckable sidekick.

80
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,240
I can't control which box
the world wants to put you in.

81
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,280
It's the same box,
and I'm sick of it.

82
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,719
You know I got into
this to be other things.

83
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,559
To express other things.

84
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,760
Like what?

85
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,479
Like something romantic.

86
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,559
This is romantic.

87
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,280
For the lead guy. I
don't wanna be pursued.

88
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,480
Why can't I pursue?

89
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
Huh?

90
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,400
I just want
something... magical.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,400
Timeless. Something

92
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,440
I can escape into.

93
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,440
Are you talking career
or personal life?

94
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Both.

95
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,800
Where's my <i>Casablanca</i>?

96
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,360
Where's... where's...
where's my <i>Brief Encounter</i>?

97
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,959
Come on! British
romance. 1940s. Classic.

98
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,439
Like <i>Hotel Reverie</i>?

99
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,879
Yes! <i>Hotel Reverie.</i>

100
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,639
"I'll be yours forevermore."

101
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,759
Is that where that
line comes from?

102
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,079
The iconic final line? Yeah.

103
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,599
Hey, I knew the
line, not the movie.

104
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,599
Weird thing is, this is the second
time this has come up this morning.

105
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,399
- What do you mean?
- The studio. Uh, Keyworth... something.

106
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,519
- They're doing some kind of reboot.
- They're remaking <i>Hotel Reverie</i>?

107
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,159
Yeah, with a high-tech shooting style.
They want an A-lister for the male lead.

108
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,520
- To play Alex? Dr. Palmer? I wanna do it.
- Yeah.

109
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,639
It's a male lead.

110
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,479
So they... they can't flip it?
Have a woman play the lead?

111
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,319
They want a Ryan.
One of the Ryans.

112
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,120
Tell them I wanna do this.

113
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,159
- <i>So I'm afraid Ryan's a "no."</i>
- Which one?

114
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,679
<i>Both of them.</i>

115
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,279
Sorry, did you say that they don't have to
talk British? They... they can be American?

116
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,039
<i>Didn't get that far.</i>

117
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,959
<i>Also, Timothée
Chalamet is unavail.</i>

118
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,919
<i>Chris Hemsworth didn't
connect with the material.</i>

119
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,039
<i>Donald Glover says thanks
for thinking of him,</i>

120
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,399
<i>but he has a family commitment.</i>

121
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,279
- So they're all NFI?
<i>- Sorry?</i>

122
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,519
Is there really not one
A-lister who's curious?

123
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,719
<i>Well, you won't believe this,</i>

124
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,600
<i>but Brandy Friday's team
says she's interested.</i>

125
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,199
Holy shit! Brandy Friday?

126
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,639
She big?

127
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,959
She's... she's huge.
She... she's available?

128
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,679
<i>I tried to explain it's
not the Clara role, but...</i>

129
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,959
Well, could we make
it the Clara role?

130
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,919
<i>That's the thing.</i>

131
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,799
<i>They said she's only interested
if she plays the lead.</i>

132
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,720
- Well, that's just...
- Brilliant.

133
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
<i>Ready.</i>

134
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,239
<i>Should I just pretend
it's a normal call?</i>

135
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,799
- <i>Yes.
- Right.</i>

136
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,840
<i>Here we go.</i>

137
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,439
<i>I realize I'm... I'm waiting for it to
ring, but it's not connected, is it?</i>

138
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,639
<i>No.</i>

139
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,280
<i>God, I'm such a fool.</i>

140
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,480
<i>Right, I'll imagine
it's ringing.</i>

141
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,880
<i>Hello, Ryce-Lechere residence.</i>

142
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,920
<i>To whom am I speaking?</i>

143
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
<i>I...</i>

144
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,760
<i>Oh, God damn it.</i>

145
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,839
<i>Well, it's just so hard when
there's no one on the other end.</i>

146
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,439
<i>Uh, from the top.</i>

147
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,520
<i>Take two.</i>

148
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,640
<i>Hello, Ryce-Lechere residence.</i>

149
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,719
<i>To whom am I...</i>

150
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,079
<i>Buckinghamshire, England.</i>

151
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,439
<i>And an outpouring of grief</i>

152
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,039
<i>as actress Dorothy Chambers
is found dead at home.</i>

153
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,559
<i>The cause of death, an
overdose of sleeping pills.</i>

154
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,159
<i>The reclusive
beauty never married</i>

155
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,679
<i>and was well known to be
troubled by pernicious gossip</i>

156
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,480
<i>surrounding her personal life.</i>

157
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,439
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

158
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,599
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

159
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,200
- It needs a signature just here.
- Oh, sure.

160
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,920
Sorry, I shouldn't, but

161
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,159
I really loved that movie you were
in about the secret CIA agent.

162
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,959
- Thank you.
- He was so good.

163
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,999
- Thank you.
- Are you still with that actor...

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,599
Uh, no, we're not
together anymore.

165
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,479
Oh, he was so good in that movie
about the pilot that saves the...

166
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,439
- I've got to take this.
- Okay.

167
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,199
Don't let the gate hit you.

168
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,279
Hey.

169
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,999
Great news. You got it.

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,919
<i>Got what?</i>

171
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,639
<i>The lead in</i> Hotel Reverie. <i>I
guess they're gonna flip it.</i>

172
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,359
- Yes!
<i>- Okay, so look.</i>

173
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,359
It's a straight offer, so they're
sending the materials to you.

174
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,639
Oh, yeah, I think
I just got those.

175
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,999
<i>They say they're gonna need
you in the studio next Monday.</i>

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,039
<i>- That's in England.</i>
- Wait. They start filming next Monday?

177
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,279
<i>Uh, no, they say no.
It's some kind of test.</i>

178
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,640
Who's playing Clara?

179
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,119
<i>Seems confidential.
It's all laid out</i>

180
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,440
in that info pack.

181
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,759
Pepe from Streamberry is here.

182
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,039
- Thank you.
<i>- Wait.</i>

183
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,959
Laid out where?

184
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,879
<i>Yeah, oh, congratulations again.
Okay, look, I gotta go. Bye, bye, bye.</i>

185
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,120
Okay, thanks.

186
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,800
<i>Drop your weapon.</i>

187
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,039
<i>Shoot him. He's
trying to kill me.</i>

188
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,559
<i>Wait. I know that man.</i>

189
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,079
<i>He diagnosed my allergy.</i>

190
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,680
<i>Arrest the other man.</i>

191
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,560
Non!

192
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,080
Non! Laissez-moi.

193
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,839
Mais laissez-moi.

194
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,080
<i>Stay with me.</i>

195
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,600
<i>Promise me you'll stay.</i>

196
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,960
<i>I'll be yours... forevermore.</i>

197
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,160
I'll be
yours forevermore.

198
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,680
I'll be yours forevermore.

199
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,639
What is
up with the printer?

200
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,840
I just need to
get this up and running.

201
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,359
There we go.

202
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,639
- Powering up in a few minutes.
- Jack.

203
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,639
Give me
two seconds. Um...

204
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,199
- Jack.
- Yeah?

205
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,599
No liquids near the tech.
Isn't that your mantra?

206
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Oh...

207
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,120
Sorry.

208
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,600
- She's late.
- Her driver said she's stuck in traffic.

209
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,319
You've only got this
stage for two more hours.

210
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,359
It's leased to some Swedes who are
shooting a loo roll commercial.

211
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,479
You said we had three hours. No?

212
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,199
I said I'd ask for three.

213
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Hey.

214
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,200
- Hi.
- Uh... Ms. Friday.

215
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,440
Judith Keyworth.

216
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,519
Goodness, can I tell you

217
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,879
how thrilled we are
that you're doing this?

218
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,359
Oh, it's my pleasure.

219
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,279
I love old movies.

220
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,359
I'm sure.

221
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,480
Meet the young lady who I've
entrusted with my studio's life.

222
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,679
Uh, Kimmy. Project leader.

223
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,600
Um, and can I just say I've been
a fan of you since <i>Zodiac Suite?</i>

224
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,319
You saw <i>Zodiac Suite</i>?

225
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,039
I did. Off-Broadway
when I was back in NYU.

226
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,279
- Oh wow.
- And I loved...

227
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,879
- Yes.
- Anyway.

228
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,999
Anyway. Yes.

229
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,799
We, uh... Let's... let's,
uh... Let's dive on in.

230
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,799
Okay.

231
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,879
So you know the
ReDream, how it works?

232
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,799
Re-what?

233
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,880
Uh, ReDream. The system
that we're using.

234
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,359
You got the info pack, right?

235
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,720
The info pack? I...

236
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,279
- You got the script and the movie?
- Read the script. Watched the movie.

237
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,680
There was a USB stick in there,
too, with the info pack on it.

238
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,680
You... you didn't see that?

239
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Uh, no.

240
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,559
- Uh...
- Talk me through it.

241
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,400
What exactly am I looking at?

242
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,400
Do... You know
your lines, right?

243
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,280
Sure.

244
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,080
Come with me.

245
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,679
We're making the movie
right now, in real time,

246
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,919
like theater.

247
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,599
ReDream is the
system we're using.

248
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,159
It ingests a movie and all
of its surrounding material.

249
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,719
Screenplay, casting
reels, dailies, all of it.

250
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,479
It creates an entirely self-sufficient
fictive dimension in which we immerse you.

251
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,080
- Can you slow down a little bit, please?
- Yeah.

252
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,119
I bet this is very overwhelming.

253
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,160
Why don't you lie down? Lie down
and make yourself comfortable.

254
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,399
So, if you hold still, I'm just
gonna attach this mesmerizer.

255
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,719
"Mesmerizer"?

256
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,639
Yeah, it's a nickname
for a synaptic fictive interface.

257
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,599
It's... whatever.

258
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,800
- I don't know what you're saying.
- Yeah.

259
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,439
Um, when you're in there,
everyone and everything except you

260
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,999
will be in stasis until the titles,
which should give you a minute to adjust.

261
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,200
Adjust to what?

262
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,959
You're a pro.

263
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,159
Just say your lines,
hit the story beats.

264
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,159
If we get too far off
arc, we'll pull you out.

265
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,480
That won't happen,
though, you know?

266
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,159
Okay.

267
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,480
Executing runtime.

268
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,239
And... syncing realms.

269
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,040
Oh my God.

270
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,679
<i>Okay, how we doing in there?
I'll be giving you direction. Brandy?</i>

271
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,240
This is insane!

272
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,399
<i>I mean, is this the
original movie set?</i>

273
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,839
Yeah, it's a little
intense in there at first.

274
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,960
<i>Oh, you think?</i>

275
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,639
I'm in black and white! Uh...

276
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,359
Look, we've got about 90 seconds
until we roll the credits.

277
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,839
So... head for the table,
the one with the newspaper,

278
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,839
<i>behind the piano.</i>

279
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,880
- Like in the opening scene?
<i>- Exactly.</i>

280
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,879
- There's, like, frozen people?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

281
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,839
They'll unpause when
the titles start.

282
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,600
And when they do, just remember
that, to them, this is real.

283
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,080
<i>They think that they're real
people living in a real world.</i>

284
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,239
- So who are they gonna think I am?
- Alex Palmer, Doctor of Tropical Medicine.

285
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,999
Who's a middle-aged
British white guy?

286
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,119
Right, that's not
who they'll see.

287
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,559
They will see and
hear you as you are,

288
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,720
and they'll just accept
that you're Alex Palmer,

289
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,799
the character in the story.

290
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,999
Okay, so to them,
Dr. Palmer is a Black woman

291
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,039
just rolling up in 1940-whatever,
and it's just fine?

292
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,199
That's fine.

293
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,199
<i>It's fine?</i>

294
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,519
Yes, that's fine.

295
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
It's fine.

296
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,280
<i>They're AIs.
They're... they're constructs.</i>

297
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,999
They only know the parameters of
the story and the character names.

298
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,879
I know it sounds crazy. It
won't even cross their minds.

299
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,359
Okay.

300
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,439
<i>Just, uh,
keep the story going.</i>

301
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,799
If you say your
lines, we're all good.

302
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Good luck.

303
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,759
Get the newspaper.

304
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,800
Okay.

305
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,920
Arc ready.

306
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,839
Feedback ready.

307
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,079
Supervision ready.

308
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,399
Forecasting ready.

309
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,960
- Prep titles.
- Prepped. Simulation running.

310
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,160
Five, four,
three, two, one.

311
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,879
And action.

312
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,280
Titles rolling.

313
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,160
Exterior, hotel, night.

314
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,600
Clara, inbound.

315
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,200
<i>Yes, it's Dorothy
Chambers. Stop staring.</i>

316
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,399
Clara speaks
in three, two, one...

317
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,640
<i>Excuse me.</i>

318
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,999
Oui. <i>What do you want?</i>

319
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,999
<i>May I have a seat at your table?</i>

320
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,199
<i>It's awfully crowded in
here. I was hoping...</i>

321
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,880
<i>I do not understand.</i>

322
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,159
<i>- Which seat do you wish to take?</i>
- Keep the paper up, Brandy.

323
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,679
<i>Perhaps that one.</i>

324
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,919
<i>That one is for</i>
mon petit <i>Bonbon.</i>

325
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,039
<i>Oh.</i>

326
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,480
<i>Bonbon does not sit on the
ground. Do you, Bonbon?</i>

327
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,399
Okay, Brandy. You're up.

328
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,080
Live dialogue
in three, two...

329
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
Ma'am?

330
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,520
I have a spare seat.

331
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,959
<i>And I can assure you, no Bonbon.</i>

332
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,239
<i>I couldn't impose.</i>

333
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,479
<i>I could use the company.</i>

334
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,960
It's a very different
flavor than dear old Ralphy.

335
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,840
<i>- Alex Palmer.
- Oh. Clara Ryce-Lechere.</i>

336
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,760
<i>Ryce-Lechere? That's
half the alphabet.</i>

337
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,080
All in sync.

338
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,279
She's word-perfect.

339
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,839
<i>Lechere comes courtesy of
my husband, who's French.</i>

340
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,879
Story on track.

341
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,079
<i>Pierre Lechere?</i>

342
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,279
<i>Claude. Sorry
to disappoint you.</i>

343
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,959
<i>Will Claude be joining us?</i>

344
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,839
<i>No, no. Claude has
work commitments.</i>

345
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,719
<i>He holds an important
role in the business.</i>

346
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,079
- <i>The business?
- Oh, my father's business, Ryce Holdings.</i>

347
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,319
<i>Oh my. I didn't realize
you were</i> the <i>Clara Ryce.</i>

348
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,519
<i>Oh yes,</i> the <i>Clara Ryce,
heir to the Ryce empire.</i>

349
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,040
- Exposition delivered.
<i>- What brings you to Cairo?</i>

350
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,079
<i>I'm giving a talk at
the School of Medicine.</i>

351
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,440
- <i>You're a surgeon?</i>
<i>- Just a doctor.</i>

352
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,759
<i>Albeit one who knows an absurd
amount about tropical diseases.</i>

353
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,879
Backstory deployed.
Hitting all her beats.

354
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,959
<i>Dreadful, yes. Accomplished,
I'm not so sure.</i>

355
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,559
<i>Oh, waiter. Another scotch,
please. And for yourself?</i>

356
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,519
<i>Thank you. A Black Rose.</i>

357
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,719
<i>Ah. A rose for a rose.</i>

358
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,799
- Attraction building.
<i>- It's a tradition for me.</i>

359
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,399
<i>One scotch and one Black Rose.</i>

360
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,639
<i>For the heiress?</i>

361
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,799
- Murder attempt number one imminent.
<i>- Yes.</i>

362
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,479
Black Rose created. I repeat,
Black Rose has been created.

363
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,039
- <i>Oh dear.</i>
<i>- What's wrong?</i>

364
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,320
<i>Oh, nothing really.
Just the piano.</i>

365
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,840
<i>A piano standing silent always
makes me melancholy. Silly, I know.</i>

366
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,279
<i>Say a pianist walked in right
now. What would you have him play?</i>

367
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,679
"Clair de Lune."

368
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,919
<i>Oh, that's easy.
"Clair de Lune."</i>

369
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,839
- My dad's favorite.
<i>- Debussy?</i>

370
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,399
<i>Do you know it? Oh,
it's the most wonderful piece.</i>

371
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,239
<i>It transports me to
the gayest of places.</i>

372
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,520
<i>And at the same time, it's
so sad, so full of yearning.</i>

373
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,320
<i>Well, Clara, if it's
"Clair de Lune" you want,</i>

374
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,760
<i>it's "Clair de Lune"
you shall have.</i>

375
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,520
What... What's she doing?

376
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,079
- Uh...
- Brandy?

377
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,079
<i>What the hell?</i>

378
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,399
You didn't say it
was a real piano.

379
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,319
I thought you could
play the real piano.

380
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,239
No!

381
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,839
- But you played the piano in <i>Zodiac Suite.</i>
- That was a backing track.

382
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,279
She can't stop.

383
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,759
The piano playing sets
up the inciting incident.

384
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,239
Uh, Brandy, you gotta keep playing.
That's the point of the scene.

385
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,599
My God, she's doing "Chopsticks."

386
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,599
Narrative
integrity failing.

387
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,399
We're heading for yellow here.

388
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,359
I take it that
means something bad.

389
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,639
If that one
hits red, it collapses.

390
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,639
Oh, great.

391
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,239
Mika, how
far off base are we?

392
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,519
So, in the original,

393
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,599
the beautiful music makes
Clara choke up with emotion.

394
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,119
She steps outside. Alex
follows. They talk.

395
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,440
It's the encounter that
sets the story rolling.

396
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,679
Can we hit that plot
point some other way?

397
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,119
Maybe, but we've got
an even bigger problem.

398
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,319
Bigger than that?

399
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,440
The poisoned cocktail.
The Black Rose.

400
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,480
Shit.

401
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,399
Clara's supposed to have left before
it makes it to the table, but now...

402
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,760
She's just sitting there.

403
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,720
And if she drinks it, she dies.

404
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,079
- Correct.
- And the whole thing's bollocksed.

405
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,759
Narrative
stress is rising, guys.

406
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,799
Brandy, don't speak. I need you to follow
some instructions to get us back on track.

407
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,239
Stop playing the piano.

408
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,679
Go sit next to
Clara. Now. Go. Now.

409
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,480
<i>Apologize for your poor piano.</i>

410
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,199
I'm afraid I'm a little
out of practice.

411
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,880
It certainly sounded that way.

412
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,840
On the bright side, you seem to have
given Madam "Doglover" a headache.

413
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,720
What a shame.

414
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,480
One scotch.

415
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,279
<i>And a Black Rose.</i>

416
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,239
<i>Just in time. I
could use a tipple.</i>

417
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,239
<i>Do not let her
drink that. Improvise!</i>

418
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,159
- Oh my God. Look.
- What?

419
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,159
- Uh, the big... goose.
- No.

420
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,119
Get rid of the drink.

421
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,279
- But I don't see anything.
<i>- Right there. See? Look.</i>

422
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,159
- Was there really a goose?
- Yes.

423
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,639
No. There wasn't.

424
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,879
No, there wasn't.

425
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,360
<i>- Mm-mm. I was kidding.</i>
<i>- I see.</i>

426
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,239
<i>Another joke, I presume.</i>

427
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,680
<i>Gotcha.</i>

428
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,639
<i>I don't appreciate
mockery, Dr. Palmer.</i>

429
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,439
<i>I had quite enough of
that in my school days.</i>

430
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,960
<i>- Good luck with your talk.</i>
- Attraction falling, guys.

431
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,280
<i>Don't let her go.</i>

432
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
<i>Follow her.</i>

433
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Uh, wait!

434
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,640
<i>Uh, come back!</i>

435
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,040
Wait! I... I'm s...

436
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,360
Dorothy!

437
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,399
Clara! Her name is Clara.

438
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,719
Divergence rising.

439
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,200
<i>Uh, Clara.</i>

440
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,639
<i>Why did you call me Dorothy?</i>

441
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,000
Oh dear.

442
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,679
<i>Uh, you remind me of someone.</i>

443
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,840
<i>Someone named Dorothy?</i>

444
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,240
<i>Yeah.</i>

445
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,920
<i>Why do I remind you of her?</i>

446
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,960
- They're way off script here.
- Sh, sh!

447
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,600
<i>She was</i>

448
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,440
someone who the
world looked at and

449
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,280
assumed had everything, but

450
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,120
on the inside, she was...

451
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
Blue.

452
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
I don't know.

453
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,360
But I think so.

454
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,720
Then it's no surprise
I remind you of her.

455
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,680
<i>Follow her
into the garden.</i>

456
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,199
Sit beside her.

457
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,280
<i>I was going to.</i>

458
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
<i>Going to what?</i>

459
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,079
<i>Oh, I was going to... to ask
if you wanna talk about it?</i>

460
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,480
<i>Oh, no.</i>

461
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,319
<i>One should never unburden
oneself to a stranger.</i>

462
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,639
<i>Oh, it's no burden.</i>

463
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,359
<i>Trust me, I'm a doctor.</i>

464
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,239
<i>And I've given up on my
dreams of piano playing.</i>

465
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,199
<i>Well, I
think that's wise.</i>

466
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,400
<i>I would talk to my
husband about it, but honestly,</i>

467
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,880
Claude stopped noticing my
temperament some time ago.

468
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,080
He's so consumed
by the business.

469
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,159
Papa used to joke that Claude
was marrying the company

470
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,680
rather than marrying me.

471
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,400
If that's true,
then Claude's crazy.

472
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,360
You're sweet.

473
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,000
Romantic interest rising.

474
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,200
<i>This
Dorothy you mention,</i>

475
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,160
<i>what's true of her
is also true of me.</i>

476
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,360
<i>You know, it's silly, but sometimes a
sense of such wretchedness seizes me</i>

477
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,600
<i>as though I'm connected to some
fathomless sorrow reaching through time.</i>

478
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,319
<i>Perhaps I was a tragic
figure in some other life.</i>

479
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,920
I thought you said they
weren't self-aware.

480
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,560
They're not.

481
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,239
The... the only reality she's
aware of is... is the story.

482
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,480
Actually, I think she might
be sensing some echoes.

483
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,079
Well, our Clara AI

484
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,480
is derived from the original
performance by Dorothy Chambers. Uh...

485
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,879
And Chambers drew
on her own life.

486
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,279
She sunk as much of herself as
possible into the role of Clara.

487
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,599
There's echoes of her running
right through the data set.

488
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,000
But when she heard her name,
connected with that essence,

489
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,960
she's grown a dimension.

490
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,679
And... and it's not really
built to accommodate that.

491
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,239
Scene ending in T-minus
30 seconds, guys.

492
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,280
<i>This Dorothy,
what happened to her?</i>

493
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,800
<i>- We lost touch.
- Oh.</i>

494
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,440
I hope she's happy somewhere.

495
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
Me too.

496
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,120
Look at me complaining
about my life.

497
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,199
<i>You must think me so ungrateful.</i>

498
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,160
<i>Oh, no. I've been there.</i>

499
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,560
<i>- "Been there"?
- I mean, I get it.</i>

500
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,559
<i>Oh, you... you "get it."</i>

501
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,280
<i>Yeah. You know, life shit.</i>

502
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,199
- No one says "shit" in the movie.
<i>- Oh my God. I mean, um...</i>

503
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,639
<i>"Life shit"?</i>

504
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,999
She's saying it now.

505
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,479
<i>I... misspoke.</i>

506
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,920
<i>No, I'm not...
I'm not offended.</i>

507
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,400
<i>If anything, it's refreshing.</i>

508
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,360
<i>I've never met someone so</i>

509
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,560
<i>differently alive.</i>

510
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,080
Romantic likelihood increasing.

511
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,720
Good night, Dr. Palmer.

512
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
Good night.

513
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,160
Forecast good.
We're back on track.

514
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,439
Narrative
stress falling.

515
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,119
Interior. Lobby.

516
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,240
Continuous.

517
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,480
Gorgeous Claude.

518
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,680
<i>Darling.</i>

519
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,960
<i>Claude.</i>

520
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,079
This is the scene with Claude.

521
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,079
Brandy's not on screen for two
minutes, so you're free to talk.

522
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,040
<i>Me too.
I'm somewhat tired.</i>

523
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,159
Uh, think we're good.
Brandy, thank you.

524
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,999
Um, the camera's not
on you right now,

525
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,359
so catch your breath.

526
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,239
<i>Hey, you
guys saw that, right?</i>

527
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,239
<i>I mean, that was insane.</i>

528
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,959
<i>Are you sure she's a...
computer person or whatever?</i>

529
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,959
<i>Because she... she touched me.</i>

530
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,079
<i>- It was weird. I don't...</i>
- Uh, mm-hmm.

531
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,679
<i>I've just seen my wife,
who is most terribly alive.</i>

532
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,919
<i>You were supposed to serve
that special Black Rose.</i>

533
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,959
Oh no.

534
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,399
<i>I did, boss,
but she never drank it.</i>

535
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,639
<i>Never drank it?</i>

536
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,080
Guys? Oi!

537
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,999
What is it?

538
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Bonbon's
drinking the cocktail.

539
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
Oh.

540
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,359
Shit!

541
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,879
Just a moment, Brandy.

542
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,880
Non!

543
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,959
<i>Bonbon!</i>

544
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,800
Il est mort!

545
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,759
Dead dog confirmed.

546
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,440
I repeat, dead dog confirmed.

547
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,079
We have a plot hole forming.

548
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,319
Can... can we plug it?

549
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,639
Okay, so Madam Roban was supposed to
steal the cocktail and drink the poison...

550
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,279
<i>This poor lady is dead.</i>

551
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,759
...which means Inspector
Lavigne gets called to the hotel

552
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,079
and asks Alex to sign
the death certificate.

553
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,959
And Alex sees Inspector
Lavigne sneezing

554
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,719
and diagnoses him with
allergies to his own cologne.

555
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,999
Which sets up the beat for the
final scene when the police burst in.

556
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,039
Lavigne recognizes Alex and
tells his men not to shoot.

557
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,439
<i>He diagnosed my allergy.</i>

558
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,839
- But then they won't have met before.
- So the police will just shoot her.

559
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,919
That's horrid.

560
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,320
Yeah, I've got it here.

561
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,480
Uh, so that's gonna
tank the whole thing.

562
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,559
So it's over, isn't it?

563
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,159
No. We... we can reset.
We can try it again.

564
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,319
From scratch?

565
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,479
No, we can't.

566
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,879
There isn't any time.

567
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,279
They've got to get in and start
building some gargantuan toilet by noon.

568
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,280
I'm sorry.

569
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,920
Jack, pull her out.

570
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,639
Okay, everybody. That's
a wrap, I'm afraid.

571
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,840
- Um, it's still going.
- Jack, just pull her out, please.

572
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,000
Uh, yeah, we may have an
operational issue in that regard.

573
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,879
What?

574
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,399
Uh, well, the expansion
of Clara's character

575
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,959
seems to have triggered a stack overflow,
causing the exit code to, um, misbehave.

576
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,919
"Misbehave"? As in, how?

577
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,119
The extraction routine is
non-responsive at this time.

578
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,799
- What?!
- So you can't pull her out?

579
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,919
Not until she gets to the end
credits. If she gets to the credits.

580
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,319
Well, the story's broken anyway. Why
don't you just turn the machine off?

581
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,319
No! No, no. Interrupting
the simulation

582
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,119
while her consciousness
is marooned in there

583
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,079
could cause a catastrophic
synaptic failure in the subject.

584
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,959
He's saying Brandy's consciousness
would be deleted, and she'd die.

585
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,999
What?

586
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,359
Uh, real Brandy
Friday would die?

587
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,720
Well, I mean, there's a 98%
chance of fatality, yes.

588
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,280
Oh, marvelous.

589
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,759
Keyworth Pictures
reinventing vintage movies,

590
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,479
attracting Hollywood stars,

591
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,999
and killing them.

592
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,599
Hey, she's back on-screen
in T-minus 90 seconds.

593
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,879
Maybe we should get her...

594
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,039
What about the Lavigne plot hole?
They'll shoot Alex in the final scene.

595
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,159
Oh Jesus.

596
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,839
That's the end. We have
90 minutes to fix this.

597
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,520
- Crystal, can we find a workaround?
- Yeah, maybe. Will I get a story credit?

598
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,800
No. We'll discuss that later.
That's fine. Uh, I'll get to work.

599
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,559
Brandy, we need to
talk for a moment.

600
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,719
<i>Yeah, we do. I know I went
off script, but so did she.</i>

601
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,599
I know I wasn't
supposed to say shit.

602
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,239
- But she kind of laughed.
- Brandy.

603
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,959
<i>I just... I wasn't expecting it.</i>

604
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,919
<i>I wasn't expecting her
to feel so... so real.</i>

605
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,199
- I feel like...
<i>- Brandy.</i>

606
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,640
- We're gonna move on to the next scene.
<i>- Right. Uh...</i>

607
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,439
The next scene is, uh,
Lavigne, the cop guy.

608
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,559
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
<i>- To sign the lady's death certificate.</i>

609
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,959
But he's sneezing. And
then I'm supposed to...

610
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,240
There's been a change of plan.

611
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,799
Change of plan, how?

612
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Um...

613
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,879
Madam Roban did not drink
the cocktail. Her dog did.

614
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,600
Oh, the dog died.

615
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,399
- Wait, the old French lady's still alive?
<i>- Yes.</i>

616
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,119
- Wait. So the cop guy scene can't happen?
<i>- We're working on it.</i>

617
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:56,199
No, we gotta reset. We gotta start
over. We gotta get the story right.

618
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,600
So the thing about that
is, um... we can't.

619
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,279
Can't, how?

620
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,519
We're experiencing a slight
technical difficulty,

621
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,319
um, which means that we can't extract
you until the narrative arc is complete,

622
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,519
as in, the credits roll.

623
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,439
- I'm stuck here?
- Until you bring the story to a close.

624
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,439
So I have to make it to
the end of the movie?

625
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,119
Yes. You say to Clara your
final line, "Yours forevermore,"

626
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,879
credits roll, we
pull you on out.

627
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,839
- What if I can't make it that far?
<i>- Let's focus on where we are.</i>

628
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,679
<i>Uh, it's day two.
Clock's a-tickin'.</i>

629
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,039
Day two? What does that...

630
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,319
<i>Clara goes sightseeing.</i>

631
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,719
You ask to accompany her.

632
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,639
Okay, yeah. That's...

633
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,279
Scene change in ten...

634
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,959
New story day inbound.

635
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,799
Brandy, you're gonna feel
a time jump at any moment.

636
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,399
- Feel, how?
<i>- It might be a bit of a rug pull.</i>

637
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,119
Time and space change instantly with
the edit. Being, like, teleported.

638
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,519
- What do you mean "teleported"?
- New story day.

639
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,599
Interior. Hotel lobby. Morning.

640
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,439
The scene is on.
It's fully populated.

641
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,360
A lot of eyes on you. Blink
twice if you understand.

642
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,080
Clara's en route.

643
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,960
Bump into her. Make
it look natural.

644
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,840
- Oh! Sorry!
- Oh!

645
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,159
- Hey, Clara!
- Dr. Palmer.

646
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,279
I'm in the habit of
apologizing to you.

647
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,360
<i>Oh, it's quite all
right. No harm done.</i>

648
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,359
<i>You heading out?</i>

649
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,159
<i>Well, I was planning on
doing some sightseeing,</i>

650
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,359
<i>but Claude's been
called away on business,</i>

651
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,319
<i>so it seems it's going to
be rather a solitary affair.</i>

652
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,119
- Invite yourself along.
<i>- Unless you...</i>

653
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,320
<i>I don't suppose... you would want to
accompany me, would you, Dr. Palmer?</i>

654
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,399
- Palmer's supposed to ask her that.
- Shit.

655
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,680
I'm sorry. It's
rather forward of me.

656
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,399
She's gaining agency.

657
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,600
What's wrong with that?
Actors love agency.

658
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,839
Yeah. I think it
adds something to it.

659
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,239
- So why did you say "shit"?
- I said, "Shit, yeah."

660
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,760
<i>No, I'm just happy you asked.</i>

661
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,879
<i>So what sights are we seeing?</i>

662
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,800
<i>All that Cairo has to offer.</i>

663
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,439
Um, you're gonna
experience some dissolves.

664
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,919
Uh, there's a montage coming up. It
might make you a little nauseous.

665
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,760
<i>- So looking forward to seeing Cairo.
- I can't wait.</i>

666
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,519
Hang on in there.

667
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,679
No, because then there's no
time for the... the scene

668
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,279
when, uh, Alex overhears
Claude talking to Otto.

669
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Fuck!

670
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,520
<i>I could do this for hours.</i>

671
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,959
<i>I had the
most magical day.</i>

672
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,159
<i>Yeah, that was a trip.</i>

673
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,200
<i>You do say the funniest things.</i>

674
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,839
<i>I couldn't have asked for
a more agreeable companion.</i>

675
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,159
<i>- Me either.
- You mean "neither."</i>

676
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,679
<i>But I said "either."</i>

677
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,240
Don't debate grammar.

678
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,919
Thanks for asking me along.

679
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,480
There's no need to thank me.

680
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,480
At all.

681
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,120
<i>Here's where
she twists her ankle.</i>

682
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,600
Oh God!

683
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,439
- Oh God.
- God. Are you okay?

684
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,079
Damn my damned heels.

685
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,199
Help her to her room.

686
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,279
I know!

687
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,919
I know you'll need help
getting to your room.

688
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
- Oh.
- Here.

689
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,839
Seduction scene next.

690
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,360
<i>Oh, not at all.</i>

691
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,759
Okay, so here's where, uh,
you ask to check her leg,

692
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,400
and things get a
little... heated.

693
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,680
That was quite
the fall you took.

694
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,880
Maybe I should check
if it's swollen?

695
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,560
Um, well, go gently on me.

696
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,920
I'll do my best.

697
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,600
How does this feel?

698
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,160
Oh, that
doesn't feel bad at all.

699
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,760
That's a good sign.

700
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,880
Will I still be able
to join the Bolshoi?

701
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,519
I think so.

702
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,560
Perhaps to make certain, you
might try a little bit higher.

703
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,880
<i>Like... here?</i>

704
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,800
<i>That's good.</i>

705
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,440
<i>How about here?</i>

706
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
<i>Is that</i>

707
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,680
<i>tender?</i>

708
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
<i>Ever so tender.</i>

709
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,520
A tad fruitier
than the original.

710
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,919
Uh, that'll be the ice I
ordered for the swelling.

711
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,920
Mm.

712
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,280
Second murder attempt imminent.

713
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,960
<i>I swear I just ordered the ice.</i>

714
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,200
<i>Well, it would be a
shame to waste it.</i>

715
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,719
<i>Are you sure?</i>

716
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,399
Champagne in my room with a stranger.
I'd never survive the scandal.

717
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,320
<i>Gosh, how
I yearn to be free.</i>

718
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,959
This is your
scorpion moment.

719
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,759
<i>Don't move.</i>

720
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,679
Hmm?

721
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,040
<i>Oh my
goodness!</i>

722
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,960
Oh, I daren't even think what might
have happened if you hadn't been here.

723
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,120
Oh, Alex.

724
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,680
Romance levels peaking.

725
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,080
Uh, yeah, that...
that is peaking.

726
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,120
She wasn't like
this with Ralphy.

727
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,400
No.

728
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,680
Oh shit!

729
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,919
- Data feed down.
- We've lost picture.

730
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,999
- Time code borked.
- Live feed down.

731
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,119
No! Fuck!

732
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,879
- I'm sorry.
- The coffee, Jack. The fucking...

733
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,280
My heart is pounding
like a drum.

734
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,560
I feel as if the whole world
has somehow stopped turning.

735
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,840
So do I.

736
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,960
What is it?

737
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,720
Do you hear that?

738
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,200
It's silent.

739
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
So it is.

740
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,000
- I'm sorry! I spilled my coffee.
- Brandy! Brandy, can you hear me?

741
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Brandy!

742
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,719
God damn it!

743
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,600
- Oh.
- Who is that?

744
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
It's Otto.

745
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,360
Your husband's henchman
kind of guy. Oh, wait.

746
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,919
You're not supposed to know
that. Forget I said that.

747
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,800
Claude doesn't have henchmen.

748
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,159
Why isn't he moving?

749
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,680
They must be resetting.

750
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,559
"They"?

751
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,679
- No, no. I...
- Can you fix this?

752
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,319
- Can I have... Towel!
- I told you about the coffee, dude.

753
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,200
I don't understand.

754
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,080
Kimmy?

755
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,880
- Alex?
- Kimmy?

756
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,600
Alex, I...

757
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,120
Wait.

758
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,520
- What's going on?
- We've lost connection.

759
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,600
- But it's still running.
- Sure, but she is stuck in the simulation.

760
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,119
So she could die? Be honest.

761
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,120
- No.
- Maybe.

762
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,879
If you had to put
a percentage on it?

763
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,239
Fifty-fifty?

764
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,600
She said be honest!

765
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
Hello?

766
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
Guys?

767
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,639
Hello?

768
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,240
Kimmy, can you hear me?

769
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Guys?

770
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,320
Kimmy?

771
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,400
Who's Kimmy?

772
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,639
Madam Roban.
She's... she's still alive.

773
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,399
She's supposed to be dead, and
the story's all messed up now.

774
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,519
- You're... you're frightening me.
- Guys?

775
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,000
G-Guys?

776
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,200
Kimmy, it's not cool to
leave me hanging like this.

777
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,680
- Please tell me what's happening.
- Guys?

778
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,240
- Alex?
- I'm not fucking Alex!

779
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,039
I need to speak to Kimmy, okay?

780
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,120
I'd... I'd explain,
but you won't get it.

781
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,359
How do you know
what I won't get?

782
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,199
The world's broken, and
they're gonna have to reset it.

783
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,160
You... probably won't
remember any of this.

784
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,199
The movie is over. I
repeat, the movie is over!

785
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,759
- What movie?
- The...

786
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,320
Oh my God. This whole
world's a movie.

787
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,600
No, it's not.

788
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,960
Look around.

789
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,560
Yeah. It's not even in color.

790
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,800
I don't know what you mean.

791
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,400
See this banana?

792
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,840
Not yellow.

793
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,200
This orange?

794
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,319
Un-orange.

795
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,319
That's a perfectly
normal orange.

796
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,959
So what color is this apple?

797
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,839
The same color an
apple always is.

798
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,360
Red or green?

799
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,400
See? None of this is real.

800
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,640
You're not real.

801
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,319
I... No, I'm... I'm
as real as you are.

802
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,600
Do you remember being a kid?

803
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,600
Do you have any childhood
memories at all?

804
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,199
I...

805
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,720
You mentioned your dad earlier.

806
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,480
Can you describe
what he looks like?

807
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,200
Anything about him?

808
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,600
- You can't.
- I...

809
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,520
You don't even know his face
because he's not in this movie.

810
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,239
I don't... I don't
like this game.

811
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,200
No, that... that's exactly it.

812
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,639
It's a game.

813
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,079
It's... "let's pretend."
It's a performance.

814
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,400
You're a performance!

815
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,280
No.

816
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,119
Stop it. I'm...

817
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,200
When I called you Dorothy earlier,
she wasn't someone I knew.

818
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,079
She was you.

819
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,440
The real you.

820
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,480
She's an actress.

821
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,360
Or... <i>was</i> an actress.

822
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,320
Dorothy Chambers?

823
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,159
You're a role she played.

824
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,760
No.

825
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,160
No, no.

826
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,920
Shit.

827
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,240
Hey.

828
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,759
Uh, I'm sorry I yelled
at you back there.

829
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,400
This... whole thing's just
really hard to explain.

830
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,720
This is all a story

831
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,160
in a computer.

832
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,680
Or, uh...

833
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,680
Or I... I guess think
of it like a play

834
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,480
in the brain of a machine.

835
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,960
For now, the movie's stopped...

836
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,919
for the moment.

837
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,040
I don't know why.

838
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,320
Maybe some technical problem.

839
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,320
I know I said you weren't real.

840
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,920
But I'm kind of not either.

841
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,800
My name's not Alex. It's Brandy.

842
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,600
I'm like you.

843
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,760
I'm an actor.

844
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,400
They... they hired me to...

845
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,120
recast this whole thing.

846
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,960
I don't know if

847
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,160
any of this makes
any sense to you?

848
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,800
But, um...

849
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,960
I'm really sorry.

850
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,279
Wait. So the story's on
hold, but time's still advancing?

851
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,679
Yeah, the chronographic
tempo's way out of whack.

852
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,759
Which means?

853
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,560
It means time in there for her is running
a lot faster than it is for us out here.

854
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,119
Faster, as in?

855
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,200
As in six, seven hours a second.

856
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,360
Does that mean we have
to pay her for more days?

857
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,639
- Clara?
- I thought you said I was Dorothy.

858
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,919
Sleeping in the lobby
makes you look like a hobo.

859
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,999
I tried the doors. None
of them have insides.

860
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,639
They're not part of the
story. Where are you going?

861
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,279
To find a way out.

862
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,160
- I'll come with you.
- No, you won't.

863
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,720
Something just
breached the fringe.

864
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,439
What?

865
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,960
There it is again.

866
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,959
Is it Brandy?

867
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,680
I think it might be Clara.

868
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,320
- Clara?
- Yeah.

869
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,199
She... she would've been
exposed to the full data pool.

870
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,280
I guess.

871
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,480
Do we think that's... bad?

872
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,440
Yeah. Yeah, that's...

873
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,840
Oh no.

874
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,840
- You seriously have to fix this.
- You seriously have to let me.

875
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,360
Stop.

876
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,039
Look, I may not be real, and you
may not be who you say you are,

877
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,960
and this entire existence might
be a meaningless pantomime, but

878
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,759
if you and I are going to
be stuck here together,

879
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,760
then I'm not going to let you
defile that piano one moment longer.

880
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,000
Go on, budge.

881
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,640
Sit over there. Watch and learn.

882
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,519
Come on,
come on, come on!

883
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,879
I think I've got something.

884
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,919
Uh...

885
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,839
- Oh my God.
- Whoa. What's that?

886
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,759
- Clara...
- Okay.

887
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,520
Why is Clara at the piano?

888
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,999
- That's not in the script.
- What is that?

889
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,440
What is she doing?

890
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,319
Oh, uh...

891
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,840
- What?
- What? Oh God.

892
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,080
- Ready?
- I'm ready.

893
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,240
- Morning.
- Morning.

894
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,440
I love you.

895
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,320
Mm-hmm.

896
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,879
"Mm-hmm"?

897
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,679
You know I do too. I...

898
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,039
Phew.

899
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,160
I just...

900
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,520
I wonder...

901
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,120
What do you wonder?

902
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,360
Do you think you love me because

903
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,640
Clara was written

904
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,800
to feel that way?

905
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,480
About this person
she met, this...

906
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,120
this Alex Palmer.

907
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,720
But you're not Alex Palmer.

908
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,640
- We have got a save state!
- Thank God!

909
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,599
Chronographic
tempo restored.

910
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,319
I think we can
reinstate comms too.

911
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,959
- I can talk to her?
- Voice only.

912
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,080
We won't have a
visual until we reset.

913
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,600
Brandy?

914
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,920
<i>Brandy?</i>

915
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,159
- Kimmy?
<i>- Oh, thank God!</i>

916
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,999
Brandy? What is it?

917
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,080
It's them.

918
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,720
- Them?
- As in "them."

919
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,559
You mean the people
on the outside?

920
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,559
Look, we had a hardware issue.

921
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,800
We're just gonna have to pick
it up from where we were.

922
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,319
Where we were? As in...

923
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,519
<i>The... the scene
in Clara's hotel suite.</i>

924
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,919
<i>The kiss after the scorpion.</i>

925
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,480
Bit of time has passed for her.

926
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,119
Wait, we're going back to...

927
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,240
<i>Resetting the
scorpion scene, yes.</i>

928
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,520
Uh, wait, Clara's here, and she
knows who I am, and we've been...

929
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,639
No, don't worry.

930
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,999
Um, she won't remember anything
that occurred after the save point.

931
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,160
Okay. Save state prepped.

932
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,679
She won't remember?

933
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,119
<i>No, just back to the
film like nothing happened.</i>

934
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,480
What won't I remember?

935
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,599
Um, you ready?

936
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:05,199
Reloading save
state in five. Four.

937
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,040
- Link reestablished.
- Three.

938
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,679
<i>Two.</i>

939
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,599
<i>- One.</i>
- Wait! No, no, no, no!

940
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,520
My heart is pounding
like a drum.

941
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,319
- Yes!
- Great.

942
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,560
Oh, thank God.

943
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,360
She's got dialogue here.

944
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,480
Brandy?

945
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,120
You're supposed to
say, "As is mine."

946
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,840
Brandy?

947
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,320
<i>As is mine.</i>

948
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,000
<i>I feel as though the whole
world has stopped turning.</i>

949
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,520
"So do I."

950
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,440
The line is, "So do I."

951
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,399
<i>So do I.</i>

952
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,680
<i>Oh my word.</i>

953
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,400
<i>I'm a married woman.</i>

954
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,040
<i>I mustn't behave
this way. I can't</i>

955
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,400
<i>feel this way.</i>

956
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,520
"Feel what way?"

957
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,840
<i>Feel what way?</i>

958
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,680
<i>Don't make me say it.</i>

959
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,559
Um, okay, so your
line here is...

960
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,640
<i>You don't have to say
anything you don't want to.</i>

961
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,160
That's not the line.

962
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,760
- What?
- What's going on?

963
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,400
<i>You must go.</i>

964
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,480
You heard her. You gotta go.

965
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,879
<i>I don't want to.</i>

966
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,719
Jesus Christ!

967
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,119
Oh, but you must.

968
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,320
<i>Yes, Brandy.
You really must!</i>

969
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,280
<i>It's part of the story.</i>

970
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,800
I'm so sorry, Dr. Palmer.

971
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,560
So am I.

972
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,919
<i>How we doing in there?</i>

973
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,040
<i>Um, Brandy?</i>

974
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,720
You... you can talk to me.

975
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,680
<i>I'm here.</i>

976
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,279
I need you to focus.

977
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,800
Can you focus?

978
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,759
<i>Look, all you need to
do is keep the arc going</i>

979
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,039
and say your final
line at the right time.

980
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,360
Trigger the end credits.

981
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,800
When the credits roll, we
can extract you. You got it?

982
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,040
<i>What... what if I don't say it?</i>

983
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:33,999
What?

984
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,960
What happens if I don't
say the final line?

985
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,040
Um, well, you'd
be stuck in there.

986
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:42,839
For how long?

987
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:43,799
Forever.

988
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,880
Mm.

989
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:51,200
And, listen, Brandy,
if that happens,

990
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,960
your actual body out here,

991
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,560
that would die.

992
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,040
But... but my spirit,

993
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,480
consciousness,
whatever, that would...

994
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,080
that would stay here?

995
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:06,960
With her?

996
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,680
Brandy, what are you asking me?

997
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,039
Nothing.

998
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,480
Good. Don't lose it now.

999
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,120
<i>I won't. What happens next?</i>

1000
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,359
Courtyard scene. You
head out for a smoke,

1001
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,520
<i>overhear Otto tell Claude
about the scorpion.</i>

1002
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,599
- We good?
<i>- Sure.</i>

1003
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,839
<i>Uh, head out, light my
cigarette, overhear the bad guys.</i>

1004
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,480
What is going on with her?

1005
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,639
I... don't know.

1006
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,680
Scene 63. Alex
smoking in the garden.

1007
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,759
<i>Well, is my
problem taken care of?</i>

1008
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,800
<i>No, boss.</i>

1009
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,279
<i>The doctor
trapped it in a glass.</i>

1010
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,639
<i>Wait. What doctor?</i>

1011
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,520
<i>The one attending to her.</i>

1012
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,399
<i>Earlier, she fell and
twisted her ankle.</i>

1013
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,679
<i>If only she'd snapped her neck.</i>

1014
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:04,719
Look surprised as you overhear them.
This is fresh information to you.

1015
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,920
<i>She dies tonight.</i>

1016
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,199
Great. Now beat it
back to Clara's suite

1017
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,959
before the assholes start
discussing the rooftop plot.

1018
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,440
<i>Let's try plan C.</i>

1019
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,679
<i>Did you sabotage the
railing as we agreed?</i>

1020
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,719
<i>Loosened up nicely, boss.</i>

1021
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,920
<i>Excellent.</i>

1022
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,759
<i>I'll invite her up there
to take in the view,</i>

1023
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,799
<i>then a quick shove,</i>

1024
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,319
<i>then my troubles are over.</i>

1025
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,639
<i>- Hey.
- Alex.</i>

1026
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,600
<i>- Your husband's trying to kill you.
- If this is another of your absurd japes...</i>

1027
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,319
<i>My husband may have many faults,
Dr. Palmer, but a murderer he is not.</i>

1028
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,960
<i>Darling.</i>

1029
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,519
<i>- Who are you?
- Bran...</i>

1030
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,359
<i>- Alex Palmer.</i>
- Crystal, how we doing?

1031
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,359
- Okay. I have a pitch for the third act.
- Uh-huh.

1032
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,279
So, at the end of this scene,
uh, Alex leaves the room,

1033
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,919
spots Otto, threatens him.

1034
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,399
So then Otto tells Alex
about the loosened railing.

1035
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,279
But Alex already knows
they'll be on the roof,

1036
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,239
so that beat's actually
sort of redundant.

1037
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,240
That's right.

1038
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,319
So what if, instead
of chasing Otto,

1039
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,959
Alex runs across the street
to the police station,

1040
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,639
warns them about Claude,
then she can meet Lavigne?

1041
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,519
- And diagnose his allergies there.
- Great.

1042
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,760
Do I get a credit?

1043
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,239
If it works.

1044
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,400
Okay.

1045
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,479
- Will it work?
- Don't ask me. You called it "great."

1046
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,759
There's no time for notes.

1047
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,079
<i>Is there anything I can help
you with, my good doctor?</i>

1048
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:30,040
<i>The doctor was just leaving.
I'll show you out, Dr. Palmer.</i>

1049
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,639
- I swear that's the voice I heard.
- That's enough.

1050
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,719
- Please, I...
- I want you to leave this room.

1051
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,320
And you can leave this
damned hotel for all I care.

1052
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,600
I never want to see you again.

1053
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,240
<i>My darling.</i>

1054
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,359
Okay, so this is where
you'd usually turn left.

1055
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,999
<i>Yeah, spot Otto, give chase, get the
info about the rooftop. I've got it.</i>

1056
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,840
No, no, no. We have a
rewrite. Uh, new pages.

1057
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:04,919
<i>Okay.</i>

1058
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:08,039
<i>So you have to make a right
and head to the police station.</i>

1059
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,039
Across the street?

1060
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,839
Demand to speak to the
highest-ranking cop.

1061
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,679
- Uh, Lavigne.
<i>- Correct.</i>

1062
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,439
<i>All you have to do is tell him
Clara's husband is plotting something.</i>

1063
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,199
- He won't believe you, but...
<i>- But he'll sneeze.</i>

1064
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:22,199
<i>I'll diagnose his cologne allergy,
and he'll remember me for the finale.</i>

1065
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,679
<i>- Yeah, that works.</i>
- But hurry, okay?

1066
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,479
Okay, it's creating a new scene.

1067
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,519
Interior. Police station. Night.

1068
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,119
<i>Just a dog?</i>

1069
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,440
<i>Bonbon was not just a dog.</i>

1070
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,879
<i>And he was murdered.</i>

1071
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,679
Oh no, Madam Roban!

1072
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,319
I forgot she was still in play.

1073
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,479
- Oh.
- Damn it!

1074
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,800
Brandy, just ignore the
French lady. Jump the line.

1075
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,519
<i>I need to speak to
your most senior inspector here.</i>

1076
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,799
<i>Please wait your turn.
Madam was here first.</i>

1077
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,920
<i>And I am reporting a murder.</i>

1078
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,800
<i>Yes, of your poor sweet dog.</i>

1079
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,159
- That's right.
- That's why I'm here.

1080
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,119
It is?

1081
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,159
No, it isn't.

1082
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,720
Yes, I know the man responsible
for murdering Bonbon.

1083
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,039
- Bonbon?
- Madam's dog.

1084
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,119
You do?

1085
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,239
Yes. The most dangerous maniac.

1086
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,679
And who is this maniac?

1087
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,439
I'll only tell your most
senior inspector here.

1088
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,800
<i>What's all this?
Explain yourself.</i>

1089
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,480
Four minutes.

1090
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,959
Brandy, just
summarize and split.

1091
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,319
<i>This woman's dog has been
murdered by Claude Ryce-Lechere.</i>

1092
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,880
<i>He's about to kill his wife.
He's been trying for days.</i>

1093
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,399
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1094
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,879
<i>Also, I'm a doctor. You're
allergic to your cologne.</i>

1095
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,759
<i>Change it, and
you'll stop sneezing.</i>

1096
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,359
<i>Okay, listen out
for gunshots, okay?</i>

1097
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,880
<i>And remember this face.</i>

1098
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,360
Final murder attempt imminent.

1099
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:49,920
<i>Oh, Claude.</i>

1100
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,800
<i>Oh, it's so romantic.</i>

1101
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,039
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

1102
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,440
<i>Yes. It's just, um,</i>

1103
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,760
<i>you've been so busy.</i>

1104
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,319
<i>I thought it was high time
you got what you deserve.</i>

1105
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,360
<i>Darling.</i>

1106
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,319
Was that enough?

1107
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,600
Uh, mm...

1108
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,119
- We think so.
<i>- You can't tell?</i>

1109
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,479
Three minutes remaining.

1110
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,680
Just head to the roof.

1111
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,520
How confident are we?

1112
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,799
4.5.

1113
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,040
Out of...

1114
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,799
- I'll tell you later.
- Seven minutes until end credits.

1115
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,359
<i>I chose this spot</i>

1116
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:34,119
<i>so you could enjoy the finest
vantage point in all of Cairo.</i>

1117
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,399
<i>You do think of everything.</i>

1118
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,600
<i>Indeed, I have.</i>

1119
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,200
<i>Why,</i>

1120
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,000
<i>oh, look at the pretty oil
lamps of the street vendors.</i>

1121
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,520
<i>I can't make them out.</i>

1122
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,519
<i>Come a little closer.
Lean over the railing.</i>

1123
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,120
<i>I...</i>
<i>It looks a bit dirty.</i>

1124
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,760
<i>I don't know.</i>

1125
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,119
<i>But it... it also
looks quite unsafe.</i>

1126
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,199
<i>Nonsense.
Lean against it.</i>

1127
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,759
<i>- I re... I really don't want to.
- I said lean!</i>

1128
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,439
<i>Claude, what has got into you?</i>

1129
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,079
<i>Just do as I say.</i>

1130
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:12,120
<i>- No, please, no!</i>
<i>- Lean over the railing. Lean!</i>

1131
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,679
What?

1132
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,759
- Get away from her!
- Not one step closer.

1133
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,239
<i>The police station
is across the street.</i>

1134
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,279
<i>Pull that trigger,
they'll come running.</i>

1135
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:24,120
<i>Well, that's a chance
I'm willing to take.</i>

1136
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,919
Alex, no!

1137
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,200
<i>Come here.</i>

1138
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,519
<i>I knew something
was amiss with you.</i>

1139
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,439
Huh? The good doctor.

1140
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,160
Well...

1141
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,079
The story arc really
doesn't like this.

1142
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,359
This is the end for you both.

1143
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,719
You?

1144
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,280
What did she do that for?

1145
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,040
- I don't...
- Claude's not meant to die.

1146
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,519
No, he's not.

1147
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,240
Police inbound.

1148
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,079
Shit, they'll arrest Clara.

1149
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,639
What will happen
if they do that?

1150
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:18,039
So they cuff Clara, and they
haul her away on a murder charge.

1151
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,599
But Alex can still say the last
line as they drag Clara away.

1152
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:24,359
- That should trigger the credits.
- So it... it becomes a tearjerker?

1153
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:27,439
Young love destroyed when one
of them winds up in the slammer?

1154
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,600
I... I don't know. It's
different, but it works.

1155
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:33,399
- A bit ahead of its time.
- It gets her out of there.

1156
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,119
<i>I killed him.</i>

1157
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,879
- Brandy, new ending.
<i>- I killed him.</i>

1158
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,559
- The cops are coming.
<i>- The police are coming.</i>

1159
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,199
- They'll arrest her.
<i>- They'll arrest you.</i>

1160
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,319
<i>- Let them.</i>
- Yes, let them.

1161
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:44,679
And then what happens?

1162
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,119
She goes to jail. So what?

1163
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,919
<i>- For how long?</i>
- From her perspective, forever.

1164
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,079
But she's not fucking
real, so who cares, Brandy?

1165
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,720
I was born in a cage.
I should die in a cage.

1166
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,239
I...

1167
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,359
No!

1168
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,280
- <i>Uh...</i>
- What are you doing?

1169
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,879
<i>- We tell the police I shot your husband.
- No.</i>

1170
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,799
<i>They'll arrest me.</i>

1171
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,439
<i>- No.
- Believe me. It is the best way.</i>

1172
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,559
<i>I won't let them.</i>

1173
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,560
Story arc is critical.

1174
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,480
<i>I love you.</i>

1175
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,040
And I love you.

1176
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:33,840
Forgive me.

1177
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,120
Clara, no!

1178
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,600
- What are you doing?
- Stop!

1179
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,600
Stop, or I shoot.

1180
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,519
Drop your weapon.

1181
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,480
Wait. I know this person.

1182
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,640
He's a doctor. He...

1183
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,400
No!

1184
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,040
Oh God.

1185
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,519
No!

1186
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,159
No. No.

1187
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,720
Don't cry for me.

1188
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,560
Remember me.

1189
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,239
Arc closing?

1190
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,080
Her body's
going into shock.

1191
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,840
I can't extract till she cues
titles. She's gotta say the line.

1192
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,200
{\an8}Say the line, Brandy.

1193
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,480
Say the line.

1194
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,400
<i>No!</i>

1195
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,000
Brandy.

1196
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,960
{\an8}Brandy, say the line.

1197
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,959
<i>Say the line, Brandy.</i>

1198
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,040
I'll be yours

1199
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,960
forevermore.

1200
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,240
- We have an ending.
- Extracting.

1201
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,519
Do you think
it worked? The ending?

1202
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,040
Did it for me.

1203
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,560
Roll credits.

1204
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,600
Not a dry eye in the house.

01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:25,879
<i>Last century,</i>

1206
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:29,120
<i>Keyworth Pictures invited
guests to Hotel Reverie.</i>

1207
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:33,199
<i>Now, with the help of ReDream
and our friends at Streamberry,</i>

1208
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,080
<i>we'd like to welcome you back.</i>

1209
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:39,599
<i>You might notice a few
changes in the old place.</i>

1210
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:44,639
<i>Renowned Dr. Alex Palmer encounters
tragic heiress Clara Ryce.</i>

1211
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,599
Waiter, another scotch,
please. And for yourself?

1212
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,400
Thank you. A Black Rose.

1213
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,080
A rose for a rose.

1214
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,160
A piano standing silent
always makes me so melancholy.

1215
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,719
It's silly, I know.

1216
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:03,319
If it's "Clair de Lune" you want,
it's "Clair de Lune" you shall have.

1217
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,799
<i>Yet, even as
their affection grows,</i>

1218
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:09,159
<i>the pair are unaware of Clara's
fiendish husband, Claude,</i>

1219
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,639
<i>plotting her death.</i>

1220
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:14,079
My accursed wife has more
lives than a damn cat.

1221
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,839
She dies tonight.

1222
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,759
Don't move.

1223
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,919
Oh my goodness!

1224
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,400
<i>So I... I just pretend it's
a normal telephone call?</i>

1225
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:31,759
<i>Well, yes.</i>

1226
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,559
<i>Right
you are, Capt. Keyworth.</i>

1227
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,319
<i>I'm... I'm here waiting
for it to ring. It...</i>

1228
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,999
<i>but it's not connected, is it?</i>

1229
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,840
<i>No.</i>

1230
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,440
<i>Hello,
Ryce-Lechere residence.</i>

1231
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,120
Hi.

1232
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,680
Who's this?

1233
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,080
A... friend?

1234
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:14,960
<i>Do I know you?</i>

1235
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,440
Yes and no.

1236
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,760
What an intriguing answer.

1237
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,960
<i>Well, tell me more.</i>

1238
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,440
How much time do you have?

1239
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,320
Since you've got a kind voice...

1240
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,280
I've got all the
time in the world.
