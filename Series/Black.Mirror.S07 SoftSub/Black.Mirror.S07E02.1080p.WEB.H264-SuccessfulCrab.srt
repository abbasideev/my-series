1
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,359
<i>A woman who
jumped from the roof</i>

2
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,999
<i>of a multi-story building
in Camberwell yesterday</i>

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,639
<i>has been pronounced dead.</i>

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,079
Okay, I found a place.

5
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,800
Five-star, swanky,
the whole thing.

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,759
And I've never been
to Spain before, so...

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,759
- Portugal.
- Hmm?

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,279
Sagres is in Portugal, babe.

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,559
Okay, who cares? Look,
it looks so nice.

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,919
- And you know all about looking nice.
- Hey, now I've got hat hair.

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,359
Yeah, I like it like that.

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,680
Here, try this.

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,039
- What is it?
- My new creation.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,800
It's focus group today, so...

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,680
Oh, sneak preview. Lucky me.

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,599
- Mmm. Yeah.
- Mm-hmm?

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,760
- Yeah?
- It's great.

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,799
- What is it?
- It's miso jam.

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,719
Hmm?

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,440
- Miso jam.
- You so what?

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,399
- Oh, you are such a dick.
- You so pretty.

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,679
You so tasty.

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,279
And miso want a holiday.

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,439
Okay.

25
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,639
People may say that they're not
ready for those textures in biscuits,

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,199
but our taste tests have
rated off the charts, so...

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,599
- Ah, ah! That's my almond milk.
- I was only gonna have a bit.

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,399
- But you can have any milk.
- Well...

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,519
- That's the only vegan one.
- Oh my God. You serious?

30
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,079
- Okay.
- Milk fascist. Okay, I'll have some...

31
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,999
Ow!

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,919
- Maria, we're ready in here.
- My kidneys!

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,159
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,279
Guys, sorry. I'm gonna
have to wrap up on this.

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,999
Looking like a
regular Hucklebuck.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,719
Yes, boss. Made
just like you said.

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,799
- Oh, no nuts in the nougat, right?
- Nah. Just sugar and egg whites.

38
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,919
Okay, good.

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,840
'Cause my EpiPen is way over
there, and I can't be arsed to run.

40
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,519
I think
you've done it again.

41
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,679
It's another of your mental ideas
that, annoyingly, really works.

42
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,999
Okay. Got my guinea pigs
at reception. All set?

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,240
Yeah. Wanna try one?

44
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,960
Come on in. Take a
seat around the table, please.

45
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,399
Hi.

46
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,080
Okay.

47
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,559
They're amazing,
but think about...

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,839
First thing I'm...

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,040
Guys, Captain Jack
Sparrow at the end.

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,879
- What?
- That guy. Look at him.

51
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,999
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,120
Thank you.

53
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,479
- Anyone want a coffee?
- Oh, yeah.

54
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,919
- Can I get a double espresso, please?
- Black for me.

55
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,079
Can I get a latte?

56
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,679
Okay, well, thank you all
so much for being here.

57
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,159
Um, I'm Camille. I'll be
running today's session.

58
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,120
Hi. Sorry, is this the right
room for the tasting thing?

59
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Oh.

60
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,120
Oh, sorry, I don't
think you're in today.

61
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,799
- Is that...
- Oh.

62
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,279
No, it can't be.

63
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,559
Uh, I should be on your
list. Verity Greene.

64
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,000
- Christ, that is her. Verity Greene.
- Hang on.

65
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,199
Oh yes, you are down here.

66
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,159
Um, come on through. We
haven't got going yet.

67
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,279
- Sorry.
- You know her?

68
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,639
- I'll grab my seat...
- Yeah, she went to my school.

69
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,519
- Sorry, so sorry.
- Oh no, no bother.

70
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,360
- Hey.
- Well, that's a makeover she's had.

71
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,959
- Oh yeah?
- Okay.

72
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,760
Guys, time to dig in.

73
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,479
Our head of flavor has dreamt up a
fresh take on our famous Hucklebuck,

74
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,799
and you lucky people
get to try it first.

75
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,959
So have a taste,

76
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,360
and let's talk about
how it makes you feel.

77
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Yeah, do take a moment to sit with
the flavor if you're not sure.

78
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,320
I'm sorry, but that's rank.

79
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,879
Okay.

80
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,399
I mean, I like
the normal Hucklebuck,

81
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,920
but these are just... I mean...

82
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,639
I liked it.

83
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,079
What did you
say the flavor group was?

84
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,919
Uh, miso. It's a sort of umami.

85
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,079
Why? Why would you do that?

86
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,439
- Can I have another one?
- Yeah. Of course.

87
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,800
Take as many as you like.

88
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,560
Sorry.

89
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,640
Maybe it's just me, but it
definitely grows on you.

90
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,359
Okay.

91
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,120
But on the second one, it's,
like, ten times better. Honest.

92
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
You should try.

93
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,240
Mm. Actually,

94
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,160
now I've gotten
used to it, it's...

95
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,039
it's not bad.

96
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,439
I like the saltiness.

97
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,519
Okay, saltiness.

98
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,199
It really compliments the
chocolate, like, the contrast.

99
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,080
- Yeah. That's what I thought.
- Great.

100
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,240
- Thank God for Verity, yeah?
- Yeah.

101
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,959
- Thank you.
- Punchy.

102
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,399
- Mm.
- Well done, boss.

103
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,479
- The colors go...
- Thank you.

104
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,040
That was my design brief.

105
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,119
Maria.

106
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,719
Yeah, it's Maria, isn't it?

107
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,399
Verity Greene. Do you remember
me? Colworth Manor High.

108
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,399
- Oh my God. Yes. Of course.
- Yeah.

109
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,839
- Hi. Wow. It's been...
- God, yeah... like, ten years?

110
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,719
- Crazy.
- Yeah. What are the chances?

111
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,839
- Wow!
- Are you here for the tasting thing?

112
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,319
Oh, no. No, no. No,
I... I work here.

113
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,319
- You work here?
- Yeah, in the R&D division.

114
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,519
- In the R&D? Oh!
- Mm-hmm.

115
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,559
Yeah, I'm just doing
the focus group thing.

116
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,719
I really enjoyed it.
It was so interesting.

117
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,039
All the new fillings.

118
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,599
- I mean, all the science of it.
- Yeah.

119
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,160
Yeah. I think I'm definitely
gonna apply for the job.

120
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,519
- Right. Sorry, the job?
- Yeah, the, uh, research assistant in R&D.

121
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,399
I don't think there
is a job going.

122
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,879
Oh, the...

123
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,200
It said on the website
there was a vacancy.

124
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,039
I'm quite... I mean, I'd know,

125
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,759
and I, yeah, I don't think
there is a job going right now.

126
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,119
- Oh.
- Sorry.

127
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,879
Yeah, I could have sworn...

128
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,559
Oh. That's a pity.

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,040
If you remember anything about
me, you'll know that I love a lab.

130
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,919
Yes.

131
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,320
I was such a geek
at school, wasn't I?

132
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,439
- Well...
- I, like, lived in the computer room.

133
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,559
Yeah, you were...

134
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,119
I'm amazed you remember me at all
because you were definitely popular.

135
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,239
I mean, I don't know...

136
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,839
Oh yeah. No. Especially
compared to me.

137
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,200
Like, what was I?

138
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,159
Um, look, I...
Actually, I have to go.

139
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,960
- Oh God, sorry. Yeah. Sorry.
- Yeah.

140
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,040
Yeah, um...

141
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,840
- It was good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

142
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,039
Hey, Gabe.

143
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,799
- Hey.
- Hey.

144
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,559
- Oh, nice one on the miso jam Hucklebuck.
- Oh.

145
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,759
Camille said they were
hesitant at first, then...

146
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,479
- Yeah, it's a grower.
- A big grower.

147
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,199
They asked for takeaways.

148
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,799
I just saw we've got an advert
for a research assistant.

149
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,279
- Oh yeah. Yeah, it went up a few days ago.
- It's just that we hired Luisa in March.

150
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,640
Well, expanding the team.

151
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,919
I mean, we're doing
well. <i>You</i> are doing well.

152
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,079
Ditta's really into
your mallow concept.

153
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,119
- Might launch it globally if he likes it.
- Mr. Ditta said that?

154
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,999
Ask him if you don't believe
me. He'll be here Thursday.

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,320
- Here?
- Yeah.

156
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,560
Gonna get myself a new shirt.

157
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,839
<i>She's this girl
I went to school with.</i>

158
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,599
I haven't seen her in
years, and then today, bam,

159
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,399
she's in one of the focus groups, and
then she's after a job in our office.

160
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,959
- In your office?
- My office.

161
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,279
- Is there a job going?
- Well, yeah, but not for her.

162
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,319
- She was, like, the school freak.
- Is that her official title or...

163
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,519
She was clever,

164
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,520
like, brainbox clever to the
point where she was sort of "off."

165
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,639
Zero social skills.

166
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,560
She had this mad hair.

167
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,359
She was always scribbling, like,
these weird little diagrams

168
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,680
of, like, computers that
she wanted to build.

169
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,599
She... sounds kind of cool.

170
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,680
No, she definitely was not
cool. Right from the off.

171
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,240
And there was this
rumor about her.

172
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Spicy rumor?

173
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,679
That she wanked off Mr. Kendrick
in the computer room.

174
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,999
What, "Mr. Kendrick"?
What, like a teacher?

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,039
Yeah. But it probably
wasn't even true.

176
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,039
- It was...
- That is...

177
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,279
Teenagers love to gossip,
even if it's bullshit.

178
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,359
This is you saying you
gossiped about Verity?

179
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,839
- Everyone gossiped about Verity.
- Okay.

180
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,760
- It was just... She was just...
- An easy target?

181
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Not for me.

182
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,759
This one girl, Natalie Caine,

183
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,039
when she heard about the
Mr. Kendrick stuff, she was ruthless.

184
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,879
She kept calling
Verity "Milkmaid,"

185
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,039
like, over and
over till it stuck,

186
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,360
and then that was just her name.

187
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,720
Like, "Look at Milkmaid's hair."
"Look at Milkmaid sitting on her own."

188
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,760
- Kids can be vicious.
- Mm.

189
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,399
But she was always this big
computer genius at school,

190
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,519
and this says she's been
working at a travel agent.

191
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,560
- Wait. Are you stalking her?
- No.

192
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,999
But to go from that to
food research, I mean, why?

193
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,359
Maybe she's got
the qualifications.

194
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,680
She won't have the
qualifications.

195
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,560
Uh, after that, then I took
molecular biochemistry at Cambridge.

196
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,639
Yeah. I was quite proud
because I got a first.

197
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,599
So I see.

198
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,439
And around the same time, I
just got fascinated by food,

199
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,919
so I enrolled in a catering
course at Oxford Brookes.

200
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,199
You've been scuba diving
since you were 12?

201
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,319
- That's your mate, isn't it?
- Mm.

202
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,319
Oh, who's been at this?

203
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,159
- Don't look at me.
- I'll write my name on it, then.

204
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,079
- Need help with spelling? Begins with "L."
- Yeah. Funny.

205
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,559
Uh, guys? Hello! Everyone.

206
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,759
Um, this is Verity.

207
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,639
She's gonna be joining us as
our new research assistant.

208
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,759
Please make her feel welcome.

209
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,359
Nick, could you
find Verity a desk?

210
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,879
Yeah. Definitely, yeah.

211
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,839
Thank you.

212
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,919
- Hi. Thank you.
- Enjoy.

213
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,039
- Hi.
- Hi.

214
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,359
- Do you want to come this way, m'lady?
- Yeah.

215
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,879
- Uh, great. You're welcome.
- Hi.

216
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,639
Hey, again.

217
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,599
- How about right here?
- Oh.

218
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,999
- Pre-warmed chair.
- Oh.

219
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,640
- Slide you in, which is a plus.
- Gabe? Gabe? Hey.

220
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
Um...

221
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,079
- That's quite the fast track.
- Yeah, well, I just thought, why not?

222
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,920
- She's overqualified if anything. I mean...
- Right, and that's... that's all legit?

223
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,639
Well, I haven't rung Cambridge
to ask if she's a fantasist,

224
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,839
if that's what you mean.

225
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,399
I'm just saying 'cause, um,
I went to school with her.

226
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,959
- Yeah, you said. Did you not get on?
- There it is.

227
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,359
No, it wasn't that. It
wasn't that. She was just a bit...

228
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,439
A bit?

229
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,560
You know...

230
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
odd.

231
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,839
Well, we're all a bit odd.

232
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,360
I'm just saying maybe
kick the tires a bit more.

233
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,479
I'll... I'll
call around. Better?

234
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,799
Yeah. Look, it's
probably all fine.

235
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,639
Yeah. It probably is.

236
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,479
It's a great
place to work.

237
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,439
We're a really chill
partnership, and, um...

238
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,399
No, internal dating is allowed, but
it's just frowned upon in some areas.

239
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,760
We'll add you to, uh,
the WhatsApp group.

240
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,720
Um, there's a funny WhatsApp group.
We do memes. We do sort of, like...

241
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,359
Hey, babes.

242
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,159
- Gabe's hired her.
- Huh?

243
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Verity fucking Greene.

244
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,279
So she was qualified.

245
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,559
Yeah, on paper.

246
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,440
Qualifications are on paper.

247
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,160
Have you got beef with her?

248
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
No.

249
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,839
It sounds like you
got beef with her.

250
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,720
Go back to your... game.

251
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,919
- <i>Doors closing.</i>
- Oh.

252
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,720
- Morning.
<i>- Doors opening.</i>

253
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,600
- Morning.
- Morning.

254
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,160
<i>- Doors closing.</i>
- So I checked Verity out.

255
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,679
- Yeah?
- Clean bill of health.

256
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,879
- They all said super attentive.
- Okay.

257
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,999
- Really smart.
- Okay.

258
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,200
- Plays well with others. Yeah.
- I get it.

259
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,319
- So, um, all okay?
- <i>Floor two.</i>

260
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,319
All okay.

261
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,679
<i>Doors opening.</i>

262
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,999
Great, because I told Verity she can
conduit between you and Yudy today.

263
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,359
- She can conduit? Conduit's not a verb.
- You know, liaise.

264
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,079
- You... you got what I meant.
- Also, we don't need a conduit.

265
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,559
It's just so, you know,
she can watch your process.

266
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,279
- Learn the ropes.
- Right.

267
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,359
- Uh-huh. And maybe even break the ice.
- Sure.

268
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,879
- Have you tasted Verity's flapjacks? Wow.
- Steady on.

269
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,039
- Help yourself.
- Hey. What's going on?

270
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,319
These are so good.

271
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,319
- Mmm. You should work for a food company.
- Yeah, maybe I should.

272
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,719
So this is my new
mallow concept, the Doubloon.

273
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,999
Mmm. I wanna eat it
already!

274
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,360
Always a good sign.

275
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,919
So, for Yudy, the kitchen head, we compile
the full list of ingredients, obviously.

276
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,839
Right, yes. That's
where I come in.

277
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,080
For today, yeah.

278
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,999
- So, for the enrobing chocolate...
- Mm-hmm.

279
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,999
...that is 70% dark
with fine salt crystals.

280
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,639
70% dark choc,
fine salt crystals.

281
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,959
- Yeah.
- Um...

282
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,959
And the, um, marshmallow?

283
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,759
- It's just mallow.
- Yep, right, mallow.

284
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,799
Non-pork gelatine
for the mallow.

285
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,160
Non-pork gelatine.

286
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,759
Actually, you know what? I can't remember
if it's pork Mr. Ditta doesn't eat.

287
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,879
Better to go totally
plant-based. Um, carrageenan.

288
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,279
Uh...

289
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,559
Uh, it's made from... it's
made from a sort of seaweed.

290
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,279
- Oh, seriously, again?
- Carra...

291
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,239
- Who's had me almond milk?
- Carrageenan.

292
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,999
- "Not I," said the little red hen.
- How do I spell that?

293
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,959
Uh, carra...

294
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,759
Uh, carrageenan is...

295
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,039
- C-A-R...
- Uh, no. It's...

296
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,719
- I know it was...
- Honestly, I went for cow's milk.

297
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,799
Um...

298
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,679
Know what? I'm just gonna email
you with the full spelling.

299
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,880
- Yeah, great. That's great.
- Yeah? Great, great.

300
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,520
Seriously, this stuff
costs, like, £4.50 a carton.

301
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,599
I actually lived above
a Greggs in Wandsworth once.

302
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,999
My waistline's still not forgiven me.

303
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,359
I used to be
hooked on their steak bake.

304
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,559
It was like heroin in pastry for
me, but now I've gone vegan, so...

305
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,079
- They do a chicken one?
- Yeah. It has weird sauce.

306
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,679
The only chicken thing I actually
miss is the Morley's burger.

307
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,079
Oh, I love Morley's.

308
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,039
Well, if we're talking fast-food chicken,
the absolute winner for me is Bernie's.

309
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,599
- Bernie's?
- Bernie's Chicken.

310
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,359
Had branches
everywhere. Went bust.

311
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,319
Whoever Bernie was, he
was shit with money.

312
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,920
It was Barnie's.

313
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,279
- Say again.
- Barnie's Chicken, the chicken chain.

314
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,640
It was "Barnie's" with an
"a," not Bernie's with an "e."

315
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,839
Yeah, no, it was
definitely Bernie's.

316
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,039
- B-E-R...
- B-A-R-N-I-E-S.

317
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,519
"Barney" with an I-E at the ending?
That's not how you spell Barney.

318
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,079
No, I think "Barnie" meant, like,
an animal that lives in a barn.

319
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,080
Like a chicken.

320
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,080
They live in coops.

321
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,359
- Honestly, it's Barnie's.
- Yeah.

322
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,079
It was the chain. Bernie's.
They were all over South London.

323
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,039
Yeah, sorry, I've got to say, I think
it was Bernie's. Bernie's Chicken.

324
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,439
- Okay. I know for a fact it's Barnie's.
- She's getting a strop on.

325
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,479
Yeah, Nick, because my boyfriend
used to work at a Barnie's.

326
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,239
He still wears a baseball cap from there,
so I see the logo every single day.

327
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,760
So I know it is Barnie's.

328
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,400
Come on, guys. "Bernie's,"
"Barnie's," does it matter?

329
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,599
- It matters that she's wrong.
- Oh my God! Okay! Okay!

330
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,319
- Let's Google it.
- Yeah, okay. Let's do it.

331
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,440
- Let's Google it.
- Yep.

332
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,120
Barnie's Chicken.

333
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,280
Oh dear.

334
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,759
N... No.

335
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,079
- Oh no. Oh, no, no, no.
- No, look.

336
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,159
- Oh, deary me.
- No.

337
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,319
- No?
- It was not that.

338
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,239
- Oh, is it not? No.
- It wasn't that.

339
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,279
- Is the whole Internet wrong today?
- It...

340
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,159
- That's annoying, isn't it?
- Oh my God.

341
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,680
Troubleshoot that if you can.

342
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,680
Feel the "Bern."

343
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,639
- Nick...
- What?

344
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,960
- Let it go.
- I am.

345
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,439
- Hon...
- Mm-hmm?

346
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Look at this.

347
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,439
- What about it?
- It's changed.

348
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,200
- From what?
- Just read it.

349
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Bernie's.

350
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,400
It used to say "Barnie's."

351
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Why? It's Bernie's Chicken.

352
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,559
- You okay?
- It was Barnie's.

353
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,599
- Babes.
- Don't "babes" me. It was Barnie's.

354
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,119
I was the one who worked at a
Bernie's Chicken for a year, okay?

355
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,879
- It's always been Bernie's.
- I swear to God, it's changed.

356
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,439
Maybe you just think it has,
like the Mandela Effect.

357
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,119
- People misremember things.
- No. I...

358
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,160
Like the Monopoly man wearing
a monocle. That was a big one.

359
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,239
- I made a dick of myself at work.
- 'Cause of Bernie's Chicken?

360
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,159
- No, because of fucking Verity.
- Okay, what's she got to do with that?

361
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,679
She's just getting on my nerves.

362
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,999
Everyone's fawning all
over her, kissing her arse.

363
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,479
- She's allowed to be popular.
- Why are you taking her side?

364
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,559
- What side? She's allowed to be popular.
- I didn't say she wasn't.

365
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,240
It doesn't make her a threat.

366
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,719
- I didn't call her a threat.
- Okay, well...

367
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,999
What? Now I'm threatened by
popular people? Is that it?

368
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,279
No, I'm just saying that
you like to be top dog.

369
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,759
- Oh, fuck off.
- You do.

370
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,279
You love it when everyone's
sucking your dick...

371
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,399
I expect people to suck my dick?

372
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,599
I didn't say "expect."

373
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,599
Oh sorry. I ask them to?

374
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,479
Be a bit difficult since I
don't have a fucking dick.

375
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,360
You can relate to
that, can't you?

376
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,239
Bernie's Chicken!

377
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,000
Oh, just through here, Mr. Ditta.
This is where the magic happens.

378
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,759
Uh, this is Nick in Graphics.

379
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,919
Um, Kitchen Head, Yudy.

380
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,599
And, of course, of Chili
Flake Bête Noire fame,

381
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,439
our chief wizard, Maria.

382
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,759
Oh, technically, a female
wizard is a witch, so...

383
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,959
Either way, I'm impressed
by your conjuring.

384
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,399
Thank you.

385
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,560
Ah, the famous miso
jam Hucklebuck.

386
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,000
I've heard good things.

387
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,760
There is a bit of
a learning curve to it.

388
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
Very good.

389
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,439
Uh, this is the Doubloon.

390
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,239
- Mm-hmm.
- It's a new concept.

391
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,799
- It's made from...
- Please, please, no spoilers.

392
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Let me guess.

393
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,760
That's good.

394
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,999
That's great.

395
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,600
Okay, so it's, uh,

396
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,399
dark salted chocolate.

397
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,279
- Yes.
- And, um, kind of a marshmallow.

398
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,559
- Just mallow.
- Mm.

399
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,279
But what's this texture?
It's very interesting.

400
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,639
Uh, well, it's bound with
a plant-based gelatine,

401
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,839
which is derived from seaweed.

402
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,240
- Seaweed?
- Mm.

403
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,080
- Um...
- The things that we can do, hey? May I?

404
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,999
Yeah. Oh, yeah, you're
the boss.

405
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,480
Mmm.

406
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,239
Mmm.

407
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,439
Tight ship you're running,
Gabe. See you in Berlin.

408
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,479
Yes. Of course.

409
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,839
Good. And I think
you should join us.

410
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
I...

411
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,559
Yeah. Yes.

412
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,800
- Good.
- Okay, all right.

413
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,239
- What is up with you?
- It's beef gelatine in the mallow.

414
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,799
- Beef?
- Oh, what? Ditta is Hindu.

415
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
- You just fed him beef.
- Carrageenan.

416
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,839
- I said "carrageenan."
- Wasn't on the list.

417
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,639
- I was specific.
- It wasn't on Verity's list.

418
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,880
Verity's list.

419
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,159
Verity's list.

420
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,760
- Sorry, what did you call it?
- Carrageenan.

421
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,359
- I've never heard that word before.
- You wrote it down.

422
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,040
You even asked how to spell it.

423
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,719
- She just said, "Non-pork gelatine."
- I didn't.

424
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,800
Luisa was complaining about
almond milk. Maybe you were distracted.

425
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,919
- Honestly, non-pork was all she said.
- So it's a verbal instruction.

426
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,639
Maybe some things get misheard.

427
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,919
I wrote it in an email to
her. Listed every ingredient.

428
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,560
Sorry, Maria, but in the email you
sent, it just says non-pork gelatine.

429
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,759
I know what I wrote.

430
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,119
Well... Please stop
shouting at me.

431
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,440
I am not...

432
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,400
- I am not shouting.
- You've been raising your voice.

433
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,199
- What? When?
- I think you need to calm down.

434
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,720
I am calm!

435
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,999
I'm... I...

436
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
I am calm.

437
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,720
Gabe, I remember what I
wrote and how I wrote it.

438
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,280
I am saying that
Verity is mistaken.

439
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,160
Let's see that email.

440
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,760
Mm.

441
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,559
- You owe Verity an apology.
- That is not what I wrote.

442
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,120
Just apologize.

443
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
I'm sorry.

444
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,560
Can I go now?

445
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,399
- She altered it somehow.
- Whoa!

446
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,719
- I don't know how or why. She must have.
- Maria.

447
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,199
Gabe, please, come on. You
have known me for years.

448
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,839
Will you please
just listen to me?

449
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,359
I am listening. You
sound quite emotional.

450
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,080
I... know what I wrote.

451
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,839
Look, you have some
personal issues with Verity.

452
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,879
I can see that.

453
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,839
But, from my perspective, she's
hardworking, you know, well-liked.

454
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,159
- She's done nothing wrong.
- Yeah, she's doing this.

455
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,560
No one is doing anything.

456
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,359
- Look, is everything all right at home?
- Don't fucking patronize me.

457
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,799
- If you want to take some time off...
- I am fine.

458
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,560
All right. Well, if
that ever changes,

459
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,159
I'm always here to talk.

460
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,400
Oh, uh, Maria.

461
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,160
In the meantime,

462
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,319
get off Verity's back.

463
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,320
Okay?

464
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,800
You're starting to
look vindictive.

465
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,759
<i>What I don't understand is how
she changed the fucking email. How?</i>

466
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
<i>Maybe she didn't.</i>

467
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,599
- Kae, I know what I wrote.
- Maybe you sent it to draft by mistake.

468
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,679
I checked the draft
folder. Fucking hell.

469
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,479
Have you... have you listened
to anything I've fucking said?

470
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,879
Every word since you came in.

471
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,159
Okay, Verity has orchestrated
some high-tech conspiracy...

472
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,399
She has always been good with
computers. Like, mad genius level.

473
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,879
- She is doing this.
- I think you're working too hard.

474
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,439
- Oh, don't you fucking start.
- I do. You're sounding...

475
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,679
I think you sound stressed and obsessed.

476
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,079
Sh, Natalie texted back.

477
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,119
Who's Natalie?

478
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,400
Nat from school.

479
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,880
It's not from her.

480
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,719
"Hi, this is Dan,
Nat's husband."

481
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,000
"No easy way to say this, but
Nat passed away a few days ago."

482
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,679
"Sorry it took a while to reply,

483
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,199
but it's been tough, as
I'm sure you understand."

484
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,280
Shit.

485
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
Sorry.

486
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Was she a close friend or...

487
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,680
Maybe just send him a
text, you know. Poor guy.

488
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,719
"Sorry for your loss," or...

489
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,879
Don't... Babes, don't call. What you
doing? The man just said he's grieving.

490
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,519
- <i>Hello?
- </i> Hey! Hi, sorry.

491
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,399
Um, this is... this is Maria, um,
from Nat's school. You just texted me.

492
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,439
<i>Yeah. Your name
was on the thing.</i>

493
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,719
Honey, stop.

494
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,359
<i>Sorry to break it in a text.
It's just been rough, you know?</i>

495
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,959
<i>With the kids and...
It was such a shock.</i>

496
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,719
Oh, I'm sure, I'm
sure, I'm sure.

497
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,559
Um, God, yeah.

498
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,599
How did she...

499
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,999
Was she ill, or...

500
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,119
- Maria.
- Or...

501
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,480
<i>- How did she... die?</i>
- Yeah.

502
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,520
<i>She... she took her own life.</i>

503
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,399
- As in, she killed herself?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

504
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,479
But why? I mean...

505
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,440
<i>I don't know. Some
kind of breakdown.</i>

506
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,719
<i>In the weeks leading up,
she wasn't really rational.</i>

507
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,879
How so?

508
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,440
<i>Like, paranoid. Accusing everyone
of lying about stuff. Stupid things.</i>

509
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,360
<i>Her grip on reality
wasn't, you know, the best.</i>

510
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,479
<i>Sorry, why... why do
you wanna know this?</i>

511
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,399
Had she been in touch
with anyone from school?

512
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,399
<i>What do you mean?</i>

513
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,199
Had she bumped into anyone
from Colworth Manor High?

514
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,399
<i>- What's that have to do with anything?</i>
- Did she mention Verity Greene?

515
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,439
<i>- No. I don't know who that is.</i>
- Fuck's sake. Maria.

516
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,879
- Are you sure?
<i>- Look, I'm sure.</i>

517
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,959
- Verity Greene.
<i>- Listen, I have to go.</i>

518
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,359
<i>- I've got to put my kids to bed.</i>
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

519
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,519
<i>- I'm gonna hang up.</i>
- If you could try to remember...

520
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,560
<i>Don't call this number again.</i>

521
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,239
Morning.

522
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
Morning.

523
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,920
Are you sitting the meeting out?

524
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,560
Sorry?

525
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,079
There was a team meeting this morning.
The rest are still down there.

526
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,280
- I'm early.
- Uh, it was at 8:00.

527
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,319
- No one said.
- I think Gabe sent an email yesterday.

528
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,600
I did not see that.

529
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,960
- I mean, it's probably in your junk.
- Oh, I bet it is.

530
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,200
Do you have a problem with me?

531
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,240
What?

532
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,760
You just seem like you
have a problem with me.

533
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,640
And why might that be?

534
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,120
I don't know.

535
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,480
You can't think of any reason?

536
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,599
I know you didn't think
much of me at school.

537
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,279
I didn't think anything of you at
school, Verity. I hardly noticed you.

538
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,680
You even said yourself you were
always in the computer room.

539
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,879
I'm sorry, but you didn't
really cross my mind very often.

540
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,679
- People said stuff about me.
- I don't know. Did they?

541
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,320
About me and Mr. Kendrick.

542
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,360
I never... I never
believed any of that.

543
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,040
Whole time I was at school, he was,
like, the only one who was nice to me.

544
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,919
He didn't care that I
had mad hair or whatever.

545
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,320
He just, like, told me I was
clever, and he looked out for me.

546
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,640
That computer room,
like, I lived for it,

547
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,480
those lunchtimes, because it was
the only place I wasn't on my own.

548
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,479
So when he was
transferred, I had nothing.

549
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,760
Because everything outside
of that was, like...

550
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
You know.

551
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,760
Kids can be fucking awful.

552
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,000
They're just kids.
They're not thinking.

553
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,560
Yeah, I know.

554
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,280
I never had a problem
with you, Verity.

555
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,800
And I am... I'm really sorry
that you had such a hard time.

556
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Thank you.

557
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,560
Mm.

558
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,559
Nick, we gotta change that
slogan by the end of the day.

559
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,560
"Crunchy Surprise" is
not gonna play. Oh.

560
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,080
What's with the
no-show at the meeting?

561
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
Hello?

562
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,919
We had an emergency recall. A YouTuber
found a toenail in a Caramel Cove.

563
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,080
Did you not get my email?

564
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,559
Maria, my email?

565
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,440
Uh, I bet it's in my spam.

566
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,959
Oh, you guys
are taking the piss.

567
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,719
Okay, sorry, everyone.

568
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,559
Uh, this keeps happening,
and it's not on, all right?

569
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,919
One of you's been at
my almond milk again.

570
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,079
And it was full this morning,
so... I know it's just happened.

571
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,120
So who was it?

572
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,680
I was in the meeting
with you, so...

573
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,479
Oh my God. It was her.

574
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,639
Okay? It was Verity. She drank
the whole thing in front of me.

575
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,639
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you are a fucking freak.

576
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,679
- Okay, enough.
- I don't know why she's doing this.

577
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,079
- I don't know why you're doing this.
- I didn't want to say.

578
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,560
I find her so intimidating.

579
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,239
But it was Maria
who drank your milk.

580
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
Really?

581
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,600
I drank almond milk?

582
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,079
Yeah.

583
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,960
Which I'm allergic to?

584
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,639
I mean, I only know what I saw.

585
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,400
- You lunatic fucking liar.
- I said enough.

586
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,080
We can... we can just
check the camera.

587
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,400
The security camera?

588
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,440
Okay?

589
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,119
Uh-huh.

590
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,439
Yeah. Let's do it.

591
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,560
All right.

592
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,600
Okay.

593
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,799
- Kitchen area.
- Mm-hmm.

594
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,000
- Play it from here?
- Yeah.

595
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,279
Honestly, it wasn't
me. It was her.

596
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,880
Let's just...
watch the tape.

597
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,079
Jesus Christ, Maria.

598
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,320
I didn't do that.

599
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,720
Oh my... That...

600
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,079
That is not even possible.
I've got a nut allergy!

601
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,120
- No such thing as a nut allergy.
- What's "nutallergy"?

602
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,440
- A nut allergy.
- What?

603
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,400
Nut...

604
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,280
"Nutallergy"?

605
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,880
An allergy to nuts.

606
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,239
I am allergic to nuts.

607
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,400
Well...

608
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,639
I have had a serious nut
allergy my whole life.

609
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,199
I've always had to read
ingredients and study labels.

610
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,399
It's how I got into food.
Because of my nut allergy!

611
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,639
"Nutallergy." You keep saying it
like it's supposed to mean something.

612
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,239
- What does it mean?
- Do you know?

613
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,159
No.

614
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,240
No.

615
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,440
Oh, now we're Googling it. Okay.

616
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,159
How are you doing this?

617
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,119
Okay, look,
Maria. Look, just...

618
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,079
- It's that. It's that pendant thing.
- Maria...

619
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,599
Oh my God. She's
changing things...

620
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,599
Okay. Whoa. Hey.

621
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,479
...with that thing
around her neck.

622
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,199
- Get off me!
- You need to calm down.

623
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,640
I am calm. I am calm.

624
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,159
All right. So why
don't we just sit down?

625
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,239
Let's... Maria. Hey! Whoa!

626
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,439
Your actions leave me
with no choice but to let you go.

627
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,879
Maybe you're struggling with
your mental health. I...

628
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,239
Whatever nutallergy
is, I don't know.

629
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,479
But you need to take a
break and focus on yourself.

630
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,520
You need to get well.

631
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,759
This is not coming
from me as a boss

632
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,080
but as a friend, one
human being to another.

633
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,760
Please speak to someone.

634
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,400
- Get some help.
- Oh, shut up, you cunt.

635
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,200
- See you tomorrow, Verity.
- See you tomorrow, Nick.

636
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,880
What the fuck?

637
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,999
Oh shit.

638
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,680

I will call the police.

661
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,879
Yeah, I thought it might be you.

662
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,519
I've got your fucking thing.

663
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,199
Your fucking pendant.

664
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,239
It won't work for you.
It's got finger ID.

665
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,800
This changes things, doesn't it?

666
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,720
You say something,

667
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,639
you fiddle with this,

668
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,959
and then somehow,
reality changes.

669
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,360
How can that little
thing change reality?

670
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,160
It's just a remote.

671
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,919
Connects to the quantum
compiler downstairs.

672
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,119
That's what changes reality.
I'll show you how it works.

673
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,879
- You're not fucking getting this back.
- It really is just a remote.

674
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,120
I've got loads of them.

675
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,519
Technically, it's not
changing anything.

676
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,039
It just retunes our
corporal frequency

677
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:19,239
to one of the parallel realities where
whatever I've said has always been true.

678
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,799
There's infinite timelines,
so I just pick the one

679
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,920
where you're the only one
who knows what's going on.

680
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,159
- So you feel really...
- How...

681
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,199
...special.

682
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,479
- Where... where did you...
- I built the system.

683
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,200
Computer lab nerdo.

684
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,040
I can change little things, like you chose
a red top this morning instead of yellow.

685
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,359
Make it so you've
always spoken Chinese.

686
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,959
Make it so we're having
this conversation in the office.

687
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,599
Or put it all back.

688
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,920
You total fucking bitch!

689
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,479
It's quite cool,
though, isn't it?

690
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,199
I don't understand.

691
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,320
I don't care if
you understand it.

692
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,320
I'm doing it to hurt you.

693
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,360
That's the main thing.

694
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
Why?

695
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,320
- You know why.
- I don't know.

696
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,160
Who started that rumor...

697
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,560
about me and Mr. Kendrick?

698
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,760
- What?
- Who started the lie?

699
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,480
I... I don't know.

700
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,360
And you're still lying.

701
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,520
Natalie Caine told
me it was you.

702
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,799
Just before she jumped.
She said it was you.

703
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,160
Was she lying?

704
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,280
No.

705
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,240
Then why?

706
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,640
I don't know.

707
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,640
Um, maybe I was jealous.

708
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,759
Um, maybe I wanted Natalie
to get off my back.

709
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,759
I... It wasn't my fault.
I just said it as a joke.

710
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,519
She ran with it, and, like...

711
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,919
And everyone else just
went along with it.

712
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:17,759
Yeah, and then it became a reality, and
weirdo Milkmaid couldn't fight back.

713
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,599
And she was stuck there.

714
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,919
Just like everyone
calling her mad.

715
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,720
Lonely old place, isn't it?

716
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,040
You... you could use that.

717
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,080
You could use that
to do anything.

718
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,199
You can make it so that
none of that matters.

719
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,079
- You could be...
- Empress of the universe?

720
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,039
Yeah.

721
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,999
What, make it so I'm
empress of the universe?

722
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,760
Worshiped by acolytes?

723
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,919
Yeah. Yeah, that was
the first thing I did.

724
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,840
Don't get me wrong.
It was amazing.

725
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,880
For a while.

726
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,640
I've done everything.

727
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,040
I've been everything.

728
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,599
But whatever I do, all
that stuff is just...

729
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,480
It's just still there.

730
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,920
Just aching away.

731
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,759
So here I am, fixing a hole.

732
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,520
Seeking closure.

733
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,839
Took me five weeks
to break Natalie.

734
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,560
You've been what, like,

735
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,120
five days.

736
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,760
How do you think you'll do it?

737
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,599
She was a jumper, but
you're not a jumper.

738
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,200
Maybe you like wrists.

739
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,200
Or, um...

740
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,999
Ow!

741
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,159
Fuck!

742
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,439
- The police are here. Armed police.
- Fuck you!

743
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,839
Your boyfriend called and
said you've gone berserk.

744
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,719
You've broken into my
house with a knife.

745
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,039
Police! Drop it!

746
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,599
Oh, thank God you're here.

747
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,279
Don't let her hurt me.

748
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,640
Drop the knife.

749
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,080
Hands on your head. Now.

750
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,840
Turn around.

751
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,439
Christ!

752
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,520
Drop it!

753
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,560
Get your hands up!

754
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,520
Stop!

755
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,999
The pendant works for me.
The pendant works for me!

756
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,159
Drop it now, now, now!

757
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,999
She shot herself. It wasn't
me. You saw the whole thing.

758
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,120
I know.

759
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,720
Who is she?

760
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,559
Um...

761
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,719
I've never seen her before
in my life. I don't know who she is.

762
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,000
So why did she shoot herself?
What's going on here?

763
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,999
We're gonna need to take you to
the station to ask some questions.

764
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,079
No, you won't.

765
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,080
How so?

766
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,600
You work for me. Both of you.

767
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,480
Yes, guv.

768
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,720
You worship me.

769
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,720
Yes, ma'am.

770
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,120
Because...

771
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,200
...I am...

772
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,040
I am the empress

773
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,320
of... the universe.

774
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,079
Hail Maria.

775
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,439
Hail Maria!
Hail Maria! Hail Maria!

776
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:57,479
