1
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,559
Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, stop!

2
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,199
It's locked.

3
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,040
The police is coming.

4
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,800
Police.

5
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
That is him.

6
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,040
Right, sir. Could you
remove the headphones?

7
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,199
Sir.

8
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,680
Uh, oh.

9
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,520
And can you look this
way, into the lens?

10
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,919
Can you confirm your name?

11
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,999
- Cameron Walker.
- Thank you, Mr. Walker. Please stand.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,239
Suspect confirmed as Cameron
Paul Walker. No prior arrests.

13
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,599
Good boy till now?

14
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,399
Mr. Walker, in line with
the Bio Identity Act 2029,

15
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,999
I am taking a DNA swab.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,240
<i>If you could open wide.</i>

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,160
Thank you. Now one moment.

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,279
Fucking hell. Cameron Walker, I am
arresting you on suspicion of murder.

19
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,839
You do not have to say anything,

20
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,919
but it may harm your defense
if you do not mention

21
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,679
<i>something you later
rely on in court.</i>

22
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,639
- How was he when you arrested him?
- He's an odd one.

23
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,599
Wanted to show me a drawing he'd done
and got agitated when Mo took his keys.

24
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,399
- House keys?
- Looks like.

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,840
Go check it out.

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,159
- DCI Kano?
- Mm-hmm. Are you "Minter"?

27
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,880
Jen Minter. Sorry I'm late.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,759
- Is that him?
- Mm-hmm.

29
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,400
<i>Can I really not
have a pen and paper?</i>

30
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,880
Just a felt pen.

31
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,200
Which one's his?

32
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
Flat four.

33
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,439
The man at the desk wouldn't
give me anything to draw with.

34
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,039
This isn't a primary school.

35
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,999
It's just I like to
draw when I'm stressed.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,759
- You might hurt someone with it.
- I wouldn't do anything.

37
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,399
It's digging in to
my wrists, you cunts.

38
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,199
Get it off my wrists! What
the fuck are you looking at?

39
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,759
'Cause of pricks like
this, you can't have a pen.

40
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,760
Fuck!

41
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,839
I had a pen in my pocket when
I came in, but they took it.

42
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,679
- They will have done.
- And my keys.

43
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,359
Why'd you take those?

44
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,640
We have to search
your flat, Mr. Walker.

45
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,359
Tell them not to touch anything.

46
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,080
Let me show
you something.

47
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
{\an8}Do you recognize this suitcase?

48
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,079
Yes.

49
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,000
So you know what's
inside it, then?

50
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,320
A body we can't identify.

51
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,000
Why did you do it?

52
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,880
What the fuck?

53
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,439
You hear that?

54
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Yeah.

55
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,559
<i>- Are we being observed?
- Only by the computer.</i>

56
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,360
The central state computer?

57
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,879
I heard it's the beefiest
one in the country.

58
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,559
Government issue. Raw power.

59
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,839
Very impressive.

60
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,839
Hey. Peekaboo.

61
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,320
Mr. Walker, just give
me your victim's name.

62
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,119
I'm sorry. I know that you are
the chief detective thingamabobby,

63
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,679
but I... I didn't catch
what your role is.

64
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,320
Psychological evaluation.

65
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,240
Mine or his?

66
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,759
- Yours.
- You'll want to know about my childhood.

67
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,239
- Yeah, maybe later.
- It's okay. I'll be quick. Um...

68
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,399
Only child, mother was
distant, drank too much.

69
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,199
My dad...

70
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,960
...he was an unpredictable, violent
giant who could never be appeased.

71
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,280
Now, I understand that he must
have been damaged himself,

72
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,680
but to a small kid, he
was simply terrifying.

73
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,599
Then I was packed off to school,

74
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,039
where I was bullied
unrelentingly for years.

75
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,999
Okay. Listen...

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,599
I'm trying to give your colleague here
an overview of my formative years.

77
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,799
Did you ever fight back...
against the bullies?

78
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,200
No. Never.

79
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,879
I didn't want to emulate my dad.

80
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,559
Because he was violent?

81
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,400
Because he was a
flawed human being.

82
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
Aren't we all?

83
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,079
Absolutely.

84
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,839
So, let's move on to...

85
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,399
After school, I made
one or two friends.

86
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,439
- Let's talk about 1994.
- I am.

87
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,879
This is relevant.

88
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,999
How so?

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,039
Because I wasn't
always this confident.

90
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,880
I mean, I've learned this.

91
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,800
Back in '94,

92
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,520
I was playing games,

93
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,960
writing about games.

94
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,200
That was kind of my life.

95
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,559
- Yes! Go on.
- Get in!

96
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,920
Mad.

97
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,760
- All right.
- Steady on.

98
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,320
Oi, Cameron!

99
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,239
Latest issue. Hot
off the presses.

100
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,879
We're... we're doing
CDs on the cover now?

101
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,079
March of progress. We'll
all be cyborgs before long.

102
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,679
Yeah. Yeah.

103
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,359
Yeah, my face
is this way, mate.

104
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,840
- Oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah...
- You're all right.

105
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,039
- Did you finish the review of that?
- Uh, yes.

106
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,760
- What d'you give it?
- Uh...

107
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,199
93%. It's... it's very good.

108
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,720
No, no. Hang on. Leave that.

109
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,439
Come on. I've got
something for you.

110
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,719
You've heard of,
uh, Colin Ritman?

111
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,159
Genius programmer,
went fucking gaga.

112
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,799
Of course, he's... I mean,
Colin Ritman, he's...

113
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,400
He's back is what he is.

114
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,319
He's working on a top-secret
project for Tuckersoft,

115
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,879
coding the whole thing himself.

116
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,199
Okay. Well, what is it?

117
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,959
Well, it's secret, so they're
not saying yet, are they?

118
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,119
And we've got an
exclusive preview.

119
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,720
Colin's asked for you to visit their
HQ to have it personally demoed by him.

120
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,559
He asked for me?

121
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,759
I said you'd be there
this afternoon. Yeah?

122
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,839
In person?

123
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,560
- Today?
- Mm-hmm.

124
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,679
Cam, don't worry.
Ritman won't bite.

125
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,239
All right?

126
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,919
- You're, uh, Cam from <i>PC Zone</i>, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

127
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,999
Nice to meet you. My name's
Mo, but you can call me God.

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,440
- Everyone else does.
- Oh, okay.

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,600
- That was a joke, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

130
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,759
Okay, shall I lead you to Col?

131
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,960
- Yeah.
- Okay.

132
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,320
This is the main floor.

133
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,000
The dream factory.

134
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,639
I gave Col his own
private den in the back.

135
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,359
You know, he functions best when
he's in his own little world,

136
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,200
away from the normals.

137
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,120
Oh, no offense, mate.

138
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,639
You know, he asked
for you specifically.

139
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,839
He said that your writing portrays
a weird yet receptive mind.

140
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,680
- Whatever that means.
- Well, he knows about weird minds.

141
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,759
All right, mate.
Steady on, all right?

142
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,039
I can call him
mental. I'm his boss.

143
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,839
And his mate. I think.

144
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,119
Sorry, I didn't mean...

145
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,239
I'm only fucking with you.

146
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,839
Look, everyone knows
about his "breakdown,"

147
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,479
not that he would
call it that.

148
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,040
But he's fine now.

149
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,440
But if you do mention it in the piece, I
will have your bollocks off with a hook.

150
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,319
All right? Col!

151
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,280
This is Cameron from <i>PC Zone.</i>

152
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
A pleasure.

153
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,559
I admire your work.

154
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,440
Uh, thank
you. And, uh, me too.

155
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,480
I mean, yours. I
admire your works.

156
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Work.

157
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,600
You lack confidence.

158
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
Sorry?

159
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,919
In print, you're strident,

160
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,440
but in the flesh, you have the air
of someone who's ashamed to exist.

161
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,040
No criticism. I like it. The world
is vicious. People are awful.

162
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,400
Perpetual terror would be a
rational response. Take a pew.

163
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,560
- Want me to hang around for moral support?
- I'm fine, thanks.

164
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,040
All right, well, give me
a shout when you're done.

165
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,479
Do you know what we're
here to talk about?

166
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,319
Um, your... your new game.

167
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
No.

168
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,999
Oh. You're... you're not
gonna show me a game?

169
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,680
I'm not gonna show you a game.

170
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,719
He thinks it's a game. The
company thinks it's a game

171
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,319
because they can only think
in terms of marketable labels.

172
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,760
That's not what this is.

173
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,719
There's not a single
line of code in this

174
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,119
that could be thought of as a
game in any traditional sense.

175
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,359
Right, well, why is
this... How is this...

176
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,159
What are most games about?

177
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,399
Escapism?

178
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,319
- Try again.
- Um, winning?

179
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,600
Conflict.

180
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,280
Killing. Conquering.

181
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,839
Caveman stuff.

182
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,440
I say we have to do a
little bit better than that.

183
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,999
We have to create
software that elevates us,

184
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,239
improves us as human beings.

185
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,920
Or else, what is the fucking point
of the tools at our disposal?

186
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,399
Um, Throngl...

187
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,639
<i>Thronglets.</i>

188
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,200
As in part of a throng.

189
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,279
Creatures. Animals. Lifeforms.

190
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,359
Sentient life.
That's what this is.

191
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,520
Not a simulation.

192
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,639
Actual life.

193
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,079
Obviously, I had to make
it look like a game,

194
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,720
or they wouldn't bankroll
it, and no one would buy it.

195
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,559
But that was camouflage.

196
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Go on.

197
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,840
Have a gander.

198
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,679
You're looking at the
first lifeforms in history

199
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,399
whose biology is
entirely digital.

200
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,119
- Um, how... how do I control them?
- Why do you wanna control them?

201
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,359
Um, well, I...

202
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,799
You can't control them.

203
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,600
They're not some obscene
puppets like Sonic the Hedgehog.

204
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,720
These are living individuals

205
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,879
bound together by a
collective and expanding mind.

206
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,679
Right, but what
do I actually do?

207
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,479
When the experience
begins, you hatch one.

208
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,799
You'll nurture and care
for it until it replicates.

209
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,399
One becomes two, two
becomes four, and so on.

210
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,319
The Thronglets become
a harmonic Throng.

211
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,239
Right.

212
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,679
Um...
So the goal is...

213
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,079
Why do you need a goal?

214
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,839
You'll come to appreciate the
company of the Throng over time.

215
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,880
As I say, their
code will evolve,

216
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,120
rewrite itself in ways
that even I can't predict.

217
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,280
Progress and flux. The defining
properties of life itself.

218
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,200
Mm...

219
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,080
Listen.

220
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,240
They're talking to you.

221
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,559
- What are they saying?
- I don't know.

222
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,040
They developed their own
language. No words, just sounds.

223
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,320
I didn't even have
to design that.

224
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,439
They just did it.

225
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,519
Mm-hmm...

226
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,319
- Medication time.
- Sorry?

227
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,120
For me, not you.

228
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,480
- Uh...
- Back in a tick.

229
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,919
<i>That was the only
thing I've ever stolen.</i>

230
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,199
<i>You were arrested
this morning for shoplifting.</i>

231
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,720
Attempted <i>shoplifting.</i>

232
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,920
Why the software?

233
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,720
Why steal that?

234
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,680
It wanted to be taken.

235
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,480
<i>And to be honest, I
think Colin wanted me to take it.</i>

236
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,400
<i>At first,
there was just one.</i>

237
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,680
<i>I had to feed him, play with him,
bathe him, that sort of thing.</i>

238
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,360
As a parent does with
a child, I suppose.

239
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,079
<i>Then it replicated.</i>

240
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,719
<i>So there were two,</i>

241
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,280
<i>and then four, and so on.</i>

242
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,880
And there really was just something
about the noises they made.

243
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,519
<i>Almost like digital birdsong.</i>

244
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,079
I spent hours looking after them, and
very quickly, they felt like friends.

245
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,559
Bit sad, isn't it?

246
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,559
Why?

247
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,360
You can make
friends with people.

248
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,239
Well, I'd learned early
on to fear most people.

249
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,240
So,

250
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,400
<i>to enjoy company,</i>

251
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,559
<i>even emulated
company via a screen,</i>

252
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,239
<i>may be a bit sad</i>...

253
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,679
...but it was water
in the desert for me.

254
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,879
You said earlier that you
did have human friends.

255
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,879
Sorry?

256
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,920
You said earlier that you'd
made some friends as an adult.

257
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,479
Oh, I... I think I meant,
uh, people like Gordon.

258
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,039
- The editor.
- Any friends outside of work?

259
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,920
One. Kind of.

260
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,560
Hey!

261
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,880
Come out! Hello?

262
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,879
Yo. Didn't you hear me? I had to
get your neighbor to buzz us in.

263
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,079
Hello.

264
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,839
Sorry. Come in.

265
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,320
I rang. You never picked up.

266
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,720
I'm only down for the weekend.
Was hoping I could crash here.

267
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,760
<i>This friend of
yours, what was his name?</i>

268
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,119
Lump. That's what
everyone called him.

269
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,319
- And what would his mum call him?
- I don't know. I never met his mum.

270
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,239
I mean, what was his real name?

271
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,839
I don't know. I never asked.

272
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,200
- You said he was a friend.
- I said kind of.

273
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,080
He was just someone I met once or twice
who saw a soft touch and exploited it.

274
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,640
- So what you been up to?
- Um, I... I've been working.

275
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,839
- Your job's not work.
- But I've got a big preview to write.

276
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,640
Well, it's not due
tomorrow, is it?

277
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,959
No.

278
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,159
Right, good.

279
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,120
I'm, uh... I'm in
town selling stuff.

280
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,880
We could, um...

281
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,839
take a little trip somewhere.

282
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,680
- Did you often take acid?
- No, that was the first time.

283
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,600
Have you ever tried it?

284
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
I haven't.

285
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,679
<i>If you're
sat around at home,</i>

286
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,679
<i>make new friends
on the telephone.</i>

287
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,400
<i>♪ 0898 55 00... ♪</i>

288
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,920
<i>It was incredible.</i>

289
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,879
<i>All my anxieties
were washed away.</i>

290
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,480
<i>But it
wasn't just that.</i>

291
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,279
They call it mind-expanding.

292
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,359
Funnily enough, that's
physiologically accurate.

293
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,920
It alters your
neuronal structure.

294
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,760
Increases the
number of dendrites.

295
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,800
Suddenly... there's all
these extra synapses.

296
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,519
Glittering away.

297
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,600
You're not just more receptive.

298
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,160
You become a receiver.

299
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,039
<i>And in that state, it
all became clear to me.</i>

300
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,640
Oh my God.

301
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,800
<i>The Thronglets
weren't just making noises.</i>

302
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,440
<i>I could understand
their language.</i>

303
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,520
I didn't have to decode it.

304
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,559
Or strain to comprehend.

305
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,159
<i>It was effortless. Intrinsic.</i>

306
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,239
<i>Just so I'm
sure I understand,</i>

307
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,079
<i>you're saying the creatures</i>

308
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,119
in the game, the...

309
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,119
Throng.

310
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,519
...the Throng, they were
communicating with you?

311
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,360
They'd been trying all along.

312
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,760
I just didn't know it.

313
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
But now

314
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,480
I could receive
their first message.

315
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,359
So what was their first message?

316
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,079
Uh, it was a simple,
repeated statement

317
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,319
combining a greeting with a
request for more equipment.

318
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,520
Computer equipment.

319
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,519
<i>You mean
like a shopping list?</i>

320
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,480
<i>Yes, it
was quite specific.</i>

321
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,760
And you understood all of that?

322
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,920
Yeah, until the LSD wore off.

323
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,719
Th... that stuff we had last
night... you're selling that?

324
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,240
Yeah, I told you. That's
why I'm down here.

325
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,240
How much have you got?

326
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,520
How much do you want?

327
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,039
Nice one, lad. Come here.

328
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,119
Hey, you're fucking
gorgeous, lad.

329
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,200
- Listen, enjoy.
- Y... yeah. Okay.

330
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Hello?

331
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,680
C... can you hear me?

332
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,359
Yes!

333
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,800
Oh my God!

334
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,960
Okay.

335
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
Right.

336
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,079
<i>But now that they
could see and hear me...</i>

337
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,879
It cuts in and out,
you know, so...

338
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,200
<i>...we could communicate
back and forth.</i>

339
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,239
And by talking, I was
feeding them data.

340
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,959
So the more that I spoke,

341
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,360
the more articulate they got, and
the deeper our connection became.

342
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,880
Yeah.

343
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,239
R... really?

344
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,560
<i>I lost hours, days,
weeks just conversing with them</i>

345
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
<i>on an increasingly higher level.</i>

346
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,959
Stick to topics us
primitives can understand,

347
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,800
like an unidentified corpse
with your DNA all over it.

348
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Yes.

349
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,239
I'm getting to that.

350
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,600
Sorry. Hang on.

351
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,479
Hello.

352
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,039
Where's your copy?

353
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,879
- What?
<i>- Your</i> Thronglets <i>preview.</i>

354
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,439
We go to print tomorrow.
Have you done it?

355
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,799
Uh, almost.

356
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,479
I can't print almost.

357
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,199
You've had three
weeks. Finish it

358
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,280
<i>and bring it in.</i>

359
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,359
<i>You've got till 6:00, okay?</i>

360
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,360
Um...

361
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,119
I... I need to use a computer
in the office to... to write on.

362
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,639
Well, what's wrong with yours?

363
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,439
<i>Uh, it's... busy.</i>

364
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,719
Busy?

365
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,479
- Yeah.
- <i>Fine.</i>

366
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,840
Whatever. Come in.
Just write the thing.

367
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,719
Whoa-ho!

368
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,519
Peekaboo. Need to crash again for
a few days. Is that all right?

369
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,320
- I... I was just heading out.
- That's all right. I'll chill on the sofa.

370
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,639
You okay?

371
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,119
You're mashed, aren't you?

372
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,119
- Only a bit.
- You are. You're tripping your nut off.

373
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,719
You still working your way
through that fucking acid?

374
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,439
You're a dark horse.
It's not even lunchtime.

375
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,999
- I'm going to work.
- Like that?

376
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,280
Nah.

377
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,119
- I won't be long.
- All right.

378
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,040
Oh my God.

379
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,520
Humans consider other forms of
life to be somehow less than them.

380
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,600
Inherently dispensable.

381
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,080
Ask the dodo if you
don't believe me.

382
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,080
Hello.

383
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,120
And artificial lifeforms
are the lowest of the low.

384
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,840
Nah. No, you don't,
lad. No, you don't, lad.

385
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,959
Just playthings to us.

386
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,039
Aah!

387
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,880
Yes, I'll
take the... Thank you.

388
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,840
Mr. Tucker, you...

389
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,960
Well, Mo... Mo, slow down.

390
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Say again.

391
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,240
You're joking? Fucking hell.

392
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,919
You, my friend, are off the
hook. It's not coming out.

393
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,279
Huh?

394
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,799
<i>Thronglets.</i> They're
not gonna release it.

395
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,000
Well, they can't release it.

396
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,679
Colin Ritman went fucking
loony tunes again.

397
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,479
He started ranting about a basilisk.
Wiped the source code and all the backups.

398
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,800
Whoosh. Whole thing's gone.

399
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,519
Mm...

400
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,759
What I'm saying is,

401
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,640
you're not gonna have to file that preview
'cause there's nothing left to preview.

402
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,480
Oh. Thanks.

403
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,760
- Bye, then.
- Bye.

404
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
Cam?

405
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,319
Hey, I tell you what, these
things fucking hate fire.

406
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,079
- What the fuck?
- You're killing them!

407
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,159
There's gotta be an
extinguisher or something.

408
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,479
It's a game, you twat.

409
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,160
Your fucking mechanism's gone.

410
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,079
It's always been our downfall,
the human operating system.

411
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,399
We're masters of the universe,

412
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,400
make all these magical tools,

413
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,840
but we're still savages up here.

414
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,999
Heads full of the same buggy
software as a million years ago.

415
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,640
Darwinian 1.0.

416
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,240
In caveman times, you had
to be violent to survive.

417
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,159
Now that's on its head, and the only
way we are gonna make it as a species

418
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,559
is if we cooperate.

419
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,720
We know that.

420
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,559
But we can't do it, can we?

421
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,040
We're still fearful.

422
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,960
Territorial and selfish.

423
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,799
Arrogant and violent.

424
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,640
What did you do
after you killed him?

425
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,800
Go on.

426
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,079
Did you... come forward?

427
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,439
Shuffle into the station,
quivering with remorse?

428
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,719
- No.
- No.

429
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,199
No, you didn't.

430
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,640
<i>Do you wanna see
inside it? A little reminder?</i>

431
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,919
He's in pieces.

432
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,159
No hands, no head,
no identifying marks.

433
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,039
His DNA draws a blank.

434
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,439
We don't even know
his name, Mr. Walker.

435
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,359
I didn't... want to.

436
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,359
No, you just had to
cover your tracks.

437
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,279
- Yes, but...
- But... But, but, but, but, but...

438
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,519
There was no sense piling
one tragedy on another.

439
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,359
Getting arrested
would be a tragedy?

440
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,079
If I got put away, who
would look after the Throng?

441
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,999
They'd be at the mercy
of God knows who.

442
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,479
So they'd spend time with
the bloke who did this.

443
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,880
I know. And I'm sorry.

444
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,599
But our predisposition
for violence is tragic...

445
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,159
<i>Your</i> predisposition.

446
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,959
Well, I wish it was, but it's...

447
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,680
- This is a human flaw.
- Save me the sanctimony fucking soup.

448
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,120
If you're sorry, give us a name.

449
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,760
Say his name.

450
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,679
There's a family out there that
don't know that's their son.

451
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,399
- What's his name?
- I only knew him as Lump.

452
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,200
Stop lying.

453
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,439
You are very hostile.

454
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,519
Am I?

455
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,159
It's a crude trait
and a poor strategy.

456
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,359
Says the murderer.

457
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,519
So, Cameron, you regret
killing this man.

458
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,639
Yes.

459
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,959
And you only covered
it up to protect...

460
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,599
Protect the Throng, yes.

461
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,559
<i>Witnessing the incident
vividly demonstrated to them</i>

462
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,399
<i>just how defective humans are.</i>

463
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,879
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

464
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,919
I was trying
to protect you. I was...

465
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,039
I mean, first, Lump casually
slaughters scores of them.

466
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,520
Then I lash out at him.

467
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,720
They were terrified.

468
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,120
I had to prove I was
still their protector.

469
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,960
And that meant devoting
my life to them,

470
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,760
doing whatever I could
to help them thrive.

471
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,960
<i>The first priority
was upgrading.</i>

472
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,639
<i>Colin had designed the Throng's
code to evolve exponentially,</i>

473
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,760
<i>so I knew they'd quickly outgrow
the power and memory they had.</i>

474
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,840
<i>So I kept going out
to salvage more gear.</i>

475
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,320
<i>Cracking it open and
repurposing the innards.</i>

476
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,679
<i>Improving the Throng.</i>

477
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,279
Ye... yeah.

478
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,199
So, um, what would you like?

479
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,559
<i>The graphics
chips from consoles</i>

480
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,399
<i>were the most powerful
things I could find.</i>

481
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,879
<i>And as newer models
became available,</i>

482
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,120
<i>the system I was building grew
more sophisticated, more complex.</i>

483
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,479
<i>The outside world didn't matter.</i>

484
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,319
<i>I was focused on my mission,</i>

485
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,520
<i>on the huge technical challenge.</i>

486
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,399
<i>Years of scavenging.</i>

487
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,120
<i>Perpetual upgrades, keeping the
Throng running uninterrupted</i>

488
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,999
<i>so their intelligence
would keep expanding.</i>

489
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,839
Just so I'm clear,

490
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,199
throughout this whole period while
you were upgrading your system...

491
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,479
I was improving
their capabilities.

492
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,399
...you were regularly taking hallucinogens
so that you could understand the...

493
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,399
The Throng, yes.
So I could receive.

494
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,920
- So we could keep on talking.
- Did you discuss your mental health?

495
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,639
- We discussed everything.
- Everything?

496
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,440
The entirety of existence.

497
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:29,559
<i>Their language was more elegant and
efficient than vowels and consonants.</i>

498
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,840
They sang strings of data
that unfolded in my head.

499
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,280
<i>Beautiful concepts.</i>

500
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,240
<i>Sometimes, a week's worth of
thought in just a few seconds.</i>

501
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,400
Could you describe
these thoughts?

502
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,639
Well, not with any
great coherence,

503
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,640
limited as I am to the
language you speak.

504
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,999
But if you got me a pen and paper,
I could draw a sort of a diagram.

505
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
No.

506
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,080
But it might make
it easier to grasp.

507
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,279
Is that what you've been
doing all this time,

508
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,599
absorbing their thoughts?

509
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,199
- On your own?
- Yes.

510
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,720
But not just that.

511
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,160
We've been working together.

512
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,759
How?

513
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,320
Well, the Throng told me

514
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,680
that they wanted to
coexist with humans.

515
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,800
But to do that, they
need to study our minds.

516
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,879
Not just psychologically
but physically.

517
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,599
To work out a means
of coexistence.

518
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,920
Improvement... for both of us.

519
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,039
<i>Over time, working in unison,
we designed a neurological interface</i>

520
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,760
<i>that would allow them to
connect to me directly.</i>

521
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,160
<i>It entailed a
little home surgery.</i>

522
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,640
<i>Not pleasant,</i>

523
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,199
<i>but not as painful as I thought.</i>

524
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,240
Look.

525
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,160
Plug and play.

526
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,520
- Fucking hell.
- Oh my God.

527
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,200
Um...

528
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,639
And you did this

529
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,600
so that they could... they
could study your mind?

530
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,959
As a potential platform, yes.

531
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,560
The mind is a computer,
the Throng a code.

532
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,639
I just hooked myself up,

533
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,720
and they ported themselves
across as proof of concept.

534
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,640
Don't worry.

535
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,560
They didn't overwrite
anything on their way in.

536
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,040
They just merged with me.

537
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,240
Like a benign parasite.

538
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,760
A living update.

539
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,920
Symbiotic coexistence.

540
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,280
Now

541
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,800
I'm freed from fear.

542
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,640
I've no thirst for conflict.

543
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,520
No more petty jealousies or

544
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,720
red mists.

545
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,160
I'm part of a collective whole.

546
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,599
And each day, our mental
capacity evolves exponentially...

547
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,279
I get it. I get it. I get it.
You're this magic machine man.

548
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,679
You're the enlightened one.

549
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,840
And I'm really,
really happy for you.

550
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,159
Now, do you wanna tell
me whose body this is?

551
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,959
I honestly only ever
knew him as Lump.

552
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,279
Keep stringing me along and...

553
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,960
I'm not stringing anything.

554
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,280
I'm here for a reason.

555
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,240
I'm the messenger.

556
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,120
That's why I stole the
bottle this morning.

557
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,759
I've never been on your
radar. I did it deliberately

558
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,560
so you'd bring me in here, and
I could deliver the message.

559
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,360
The message?

560
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,199
The message.

561
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,240
- From the...
- From the Throng.

562
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,240
So what is the message?

563
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,959
I'll need a pen and paper.

564
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,119
- Fucking hell!
- I can't just describe it.

565
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,519
You're not getting a thing
until you give me a name.

566
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,159
No. No, no, no, no.
I have to do this.

567
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,279
A piece of scrap paper. A
felt-tip pen. That would do.

568
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,800
Shall we take a minute?

569
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
Yeah.

570
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,199
No, no, no, no.

571
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,279
I'm not handing Captain
Cuckoo a sketch pad

572
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,159
so he can sketch a robotic arsehole
or whatever the fuck he wants to do.

573
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,279
- I know you're frustrated.
- Just a touch.

574
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,399
- But I don't see the harm.
- He can stick a name to that body.

575
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,079
- We don't know that.
- He's choosing not to.

576
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,399
We don't know that either. Let's
just give him a piece of paper...

577
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,359
No.

578
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,759
He thinks it's important.

579
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,200
Well, he's not in charge, is he?

580
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,999
You saw the hole in his head.
He's... he's delusional.

581
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,240
Yeah, you're right.

582
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,599
But if we play along, he's
more likely to open up.

583
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,240
And then maybe you'll
get what you want.

584
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,200
There you go.

585
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,239
Thank you.

586
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,960
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

587
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,880
Thank you.

588
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,319
What are you drawing? Mr. Bump?

589
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,719
You'll see in a moment.

590
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,159
Well, how long's a moment?

591
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,360
Sorry. Sorry, I need to focus.

592
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,879
Almost done.

593
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,920
Are you?

594
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
There.

595
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,040
So, what is that?

596
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,839
It's code.

597
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,479
I don't understand code.

598
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,120
No, but the system does.

599
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,599
{\an8}<i>It was impossible to breach
the firewall from outside.</i>

600
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,759
This is a simple
program they wrote

601
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,799
that commands your
state computer

602
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,840
<i>to open a back door
for the Throng,</i>

603
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,599
<i>permitting access to
all that juicy power.</i>

604
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,760
Enough.

605
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,199
This will grant the Throng

606
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,439
infinitely more processing
capability than they've had to date,

607
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,999
prompting an immediate
singularity event.

608
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,559
The Throng will instantly
adapt their essence

609
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,799
into a signal transmissible
to the human mind.

610
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,159
And you won't need
drugs or surgery.

611
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,639
You'll merely have to
hear it to receive it.

612
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,039
To absorb it. Any moment now,

613
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,919
the state computer will trigger the
Global Emergency Broadcast System,

614
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,799
and a signal will be
simultaneously disseminated

615
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,119
by every connected
device in the world.

616
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,839
Just tell me your victim's name.

617
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,439
I said I never knew it.

618
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,159
Twenty seconds from now,

619
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,640
you will never need names again.

620
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,120
Here we go.

621
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,000
Jesus.

622
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,599
Fuck's sake.

623
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,359
- Whatever you're doing, stop it.
- It's gonna be okay.

624
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,399
Stop it.

625
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,999
You're just a frightened little
man, but you don't have to be.

626
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,080
Oh! Get off him!

627
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,440
This is transformative.

628
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,719
You'll all merge with an
advanced collective intelligence.

629
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,360
Benevolent unity of mind.

630
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,599
An upgrade for all of us.

631
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,679
Shut up!

632
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,280
An end to conflict.

633
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,240
I swear,

634
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,999
everything will
be so much better.
