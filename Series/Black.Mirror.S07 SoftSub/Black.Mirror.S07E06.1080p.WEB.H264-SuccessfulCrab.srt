{\an8}<i>Play</i> Infinity, <i>the
most immersive video game in history.</i>

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,879
Hi. I'm Nanette. Nanette Cole.

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,279
<i>- You're Robert Daly, right?</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,680
I just wanted to, uh, pass on

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,319
my admiration to the person
who actually designed <i>Infinity.</i>

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,440
<i>Just some beautiful code.</i>

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,519
Oh, are you okay, man?

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,919
Ooh, vintage!

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,119
- Yeah, it's <i>Space Fleet.</i>
- Wow.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,799
It's a TV show.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,599
Aboard the spaceship
USS Callister. Okay.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,599
Don't be too nice to him
'cause he gets a bit stare-y.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,960
Thanks, Shania.

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,159
- <i>Where... where am I?</i>
<i>- Onboard Daly's ship.</i>

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,719
<i>The USS Callister.
We are its loyal space crew,</i>

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,519
and now, apparently, so are you.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,359
Daly's created an identical
digital version of you,

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,119
of all of us, from your DNA,

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,920
He'll have harvested it somehow.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,279
<i>He grew you inside his
computer, and, bam, a copy of you.</i>

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,679
A digital clone.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,879
You're not just disgraceful.
You're disgusting, all of you.

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,839
- Yes, Captain.
- Of course, Captain.

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,279
<i>The wormhole.</i>

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,040
That is the Christmas update
patch preinstalling itself.

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,239
What if we fly
into the wormhole?

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,159
We'd be free.

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,559
- Computer, where's the USS Callister?
<i>- On course.</i>

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,199
- On course for where?
<i>- The update vortex.</i>

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,959
Sons of bitches!

31
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,320
Fuck you to death.

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,320
Come on, come on!

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,439
We're not
on Daly's computer anymore.

34
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,799
We're in the cloud.

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,079
Where is Daly?

36
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,360
Exit game. Exit fucking game!

37
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,040
Exit fucking game!

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,199
What do we do now?

39
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,999
An infinite procedurally generated
universe at our disposal.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,279
Holy mackerel.

41
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,600
<i>Lieutenant Cole,</i>

42
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,879
welcome aboard.

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,799
Crew, we have a new
member of the team.

44
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,879
Science Officer Nanette
Cole, please take your post.

45
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,519
- No.
- I am your captain. An order is an order.

46
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,000
Then go fuck yourself.

47
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,120
Oh dear. Can't see?

48
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,160
Can't breathe?

49
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,640
I can keep you like this
forever if I feel like it,

50
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,599
forever gasping for breath
with a mouth that isn't there.

51
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,720
<i>Captain. Captain.</i>

52
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,999
<i>Captain? Are you there?</i>

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,079
Yeah.

54
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,840
<i>We need you on the bridge.
Looks like we got a good target.</i>

55
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,720
Okay, I'll be right there.

56
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,680
Jesus Christ.

57
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,159
Either of you watch the
Wrexham game last night?

58
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,320
- Not into football, fam.
- Bro, especially Welsh football.

59
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,679
- You get me?
- Well, it was mental though.

60
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,319
- They were two-nil down...
- Properly not into it, bruv.

61
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,639
Fuck! Bro, when's your boy coming, man?
It's gone 8:00. I wanna get started.

62
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,039
Morris said he'll join
when he's had his lasagna.

63
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,720
Yo, someone's coming.

64
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,359
That will be your mate.

65
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,519
Here we go.

66
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,040
He hasn't joined the party.

67
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,759
- Hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons.

68
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,639
We don't want
trouble. We just want your credits.

69
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,399
Who are you? Why don't
you have player tags?

70
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,799
Either of you Morris?

71
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,319
Give us
your credit sticks now!

72
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,359
- They're not Morris.
- She said credits. Now!

73
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,759
Everyone has player tags.

74
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,880
How come...

75
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,839
- Hey, what the hell, man?
- Come on!

76
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,559
We
said credits, now!

77
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,999
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, okay, okay!
- Okay, okay.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,919
Hand
them over. Nice and slow.

79
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,479
- Go on.
- Hardly in the spirit of the game.

80
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,800
It's
not a game for us.

81
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,679
What does that mean?

82
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,319
Whoa, whoa, you're... you're bleeding.
There's never any blood in this game.

83
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,239
Just give
me the goddamn credits.

84
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,760
Seriously, that's blood.

85
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,520
Credits! Now!

86
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,879
I'm reporting this. Whatever
you're doing, you'll get banned.

87
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,039
Both of you bloody...
bottomholes.

88
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,999
Who are you
reporting? No player tags.

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,240
No, no, no! Don't, don't!

90
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,999
- Bollocks.
- Language, Jonathan!

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,400
Sorry, Mam.

92
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,040
- <i>Dudani, port us back.</i>
- Teleporting.

93
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,039
- How'd it go?
- Things got a little spicy.

94
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,439
You got into combat shit?

95
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,599
If I was there, I would've popped
'em. Bap-bap! Gangster style.

96
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,679
- You're hurt. What happened?
- No, it missed the nipple. It's fine.

97
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,279
The important thing is,
we got a lot more money.

98
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,839
We've got a whole...

99
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,039
- Thirty-four credits.
- Won't buy much fuel.

100
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,359
We're almost out of ammo.

101
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,239
They're monetizing the shit out of
this game. Everything costs double.

102
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,479
Cost of existing crisis.

103
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,599
I could've
squeezed more out of them.

104
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,319
- That was all they had.
- Guys, guys, guys! Hey!

105
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,999
This is not what we wanted.

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,599
But enough to keep us going
for a few days. Right, Kabir?

107
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,959
- Right.
- Yeah, right. Okay.

108
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,559
So I think we focus on
that. And we keep going.

109
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,080
And next time, we will get more.

110
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,599
And, uh, yeah.

111
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,559
You want me to bandage tit?

112
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,559
What? No. It's just a scratch.
I'm gonna patch it up in my room.

113
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,759
And, uh, I'm just gonna
take a quick five,

114
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,000
and then we will plot the
course for our next hit.

115
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,919
Aye, aye, Captain.

116
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,840
How does one bandage a tit?

117
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,479
Hey. Hey. What is with that
"next time's the charm" bullshit?

118
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,119
- We almost died.
- But we didn't.

119
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,119
But it's getting worse every day.
We are outnumbered. Outgunned.

120
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,799
- Yeah, I know.
- So what is the plan?

121
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,279
Keep robbing folks, run around
like rats trying to survive?

122
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,959
- Not gonna survive without credits.
- We'll be lucky if we survive at all.

123
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,159
- You think I'm magically unaware of that?
- That's not what I'm trying to say.

124
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,719
Shania was blasted apart
right in front of me,

125
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,119
what, four weeks ago?

126
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,639
I don't know about you, but I can
still smell her fucking blood.

127
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,799
Losing her was hard
on all of us. Okay?

128
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,639
I have tried to find another
solution, and I can't.

129
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,079
I run our odds in my head
every minute of every day.

130
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,839
It's 30 million players
versus the five of us.

131
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,000
We are fucked. We're gonna die.

132
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,280
Is that what you want
me to tell everyone?

133
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,920
Look, I'm just trying to say, giving
the crew a false sense of hope

134
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,680
isn't a great idea, Captain.

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,640
Well, I didn't ask for the job.

136
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,200
If I could hit a button and go
back to my old life, I would.

137
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,840
But wouldn't we all?

138
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,759
<i>Thirteenth floor.</i>

139
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,200
<i>- Welcome to Callister.</i>
- Sorry, excuse me. Sorry.

140
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
Um...

141
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,559
Elena, can I...

142
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,759
Is your fault is dead.

143
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,679
- What?
- Is dead, and is your fault.

144
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,919
No. What happened to
Robert Daly is not...

145
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,320
Your pass is dead because
you did not renew.

146
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,799
My pass.

147
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,560
You must renew each month.

148
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
Um...

149
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,080
Can I get a temporary one?

150
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,320
Sorry. I've
had a lot on my mind.

151
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,040
What's... what's that?

152
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,759
Memorial to Mr. Daly.

153
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
He's been dead for
months. Why now?

154
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,560
Mr. Walton put there this
morning to impress journalist.

155
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,559
- What journalist?
- From <i>New York Times.</i>

156
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,040
He will be here soon.

157
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,680
You want pass or no?

158
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,040
Thank you.

159
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,640
You're welcome.

160
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,999
Hey, I'm doing a coffee
run. Want anything?

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,839
- Um, no, I'm okay. Thank you.
- You sure.

162
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh shit.

163
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,599
Shi...

164
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,359
- Oh, you okay?
- Yeah.

165
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,799
- You good? Need a hand?
- Yeah.

166
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,839
- I'm okay, thank you.
- Here's one anyway.

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,279
Thank you, Karl.

168
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,600
- Anytime. Here to help.
- Mm-hmm.

169
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,319
Uh, Mr. Walton?

170
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,479
Uh, I heard no knocking,
Kabir. Was there knocking?

171
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,559
- Can you knock?
- It's important.

172
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,119
I'm very busy right now, so
can I please ignore you later?

173
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,239
We got a load more complaints about
those anonymous in-game robberies.

174
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,279
Players are pissed. They're
getting shot. They're losing money.

175
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,399
It's a video game. Shit
does happen in those.

176
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,919
And whoever's doing this,
they don't have player tags.

177
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,120
- So what?
- So that's not possible.

178
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,879
Wait, no player tags
means... no subscription fee.

179
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,240
- Right?
- Right.

180
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,879
Way to bury the fucking lede,
Kabir. How many freeloading fucks?

181
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,879
- Right now?
- Mm-hmm.

182
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,999
- Two.
- Two?

183
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,159
As far as I can tell, yeah.

184
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,679
- Come on, man.
- The money's not the point.

185
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,719
It should not be
possible. This is serious.

186
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,879
- <i>Your guest is here.</i>
- Please send him in.

187
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,079
Sir, these...

188
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,879
Thank you for sharing, but I
have actual boss shit to do.

189
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,400
So could you please, I
don't know, fuck away?

190
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,640
Okay.

191
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,920
- Hey, do you want a coffee?
- No, Nate. Thank you.

192
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,080
Okay, just like you
practiced. Come on.

193
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,839
Um, Mr. Walton?

194
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,479
- Oh.
- How's my breath?

195
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,040
Uh, minty.

196
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,719
Right.

197
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,999
So, look, I've been thinking.

198
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,639
I've been an intern here
for, like, 18 months now,

199
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,439
and I was thinking maybe it's time I
took on more, uh, responsibilities.

200
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,279
- And I was wondering how you might feel...
- Ow! Yes.

201
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,199
- Yes.
- Yeah?

202
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,959
I would love a soy skim latte.

203
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,640
- Oh. Uh...
- No sugar.

204
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,079
- Hey.
- Hey. Kris El Masry, <i>New York Times.</i>

205
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,319
Of course, James Walton.
Capitalist asshole.

206
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,479
What can I get you?
Coffee? Tea? Foot rub?

207
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,240
- No, I'm okay.
- Okay.

208
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,800
- Is here good?
- Pop a squat. That's the comfy spot.

209
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,759
Now, is this gonna go in
the tech section or culture?

210
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,999
Because I vote for culture.

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,639
Uh... No, most likely news.

212
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,599
- Oh fuck, shit. That's great.
- Yeah.

213
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,599
Great. I love that. You have the best
news coverage. I've always said that.

214
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,519
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

215
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,760
Well, that's good.

216
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,719
Come on.

217
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,839
<i>- No way.
- Yeah.</i>

218
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,280
<i>Cool. Um, okay. Look, am
I okay to record this?</i>

219
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,680
- You weren't already recording?
- No, sorry.

220
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,439
<i>Want me to say
the guitar stuff again?</i>

221
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,279
<i>No, you're
good. Okay, cool. So</i>...

222
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,719
<i>Let's do it.</i>

223
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,319
<i>- It's on?</i>
<i>- It's on. Recording now.</i>

224
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,239
<i>Okay, look.</i>

225
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,039
I mean, obviously, I have to
start by asking about Robert Daly.

226
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,319
I saw the tribute at reception.

227
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,080
- Oh, yeah, I can't bear to take that down.
- Yeah.

228
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,600
That's a lovely photo
of the both of you.

229
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,440
Oh, this one.

230
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,479
Twelve years ago that was.
Look at us. The pioneers.

231
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,800
Batman and Robin.

232
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
I'm Batman.

233
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,960
I gotta tell you, Bob's passing,

234
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,559
all it does is compel me
to build on his legacy.

235
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,639
You know, yeah, he's gone, but... he's
always here at the heart of <i>Infinity</i>.

236
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,959
- Yeah.
- That's our reality.

237
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,359
Let's talk about <i>Infinity</i>.

238
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,119
Let's talk about the most immersive
multiplayer game in human history.

239
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,079
But there's been talk of players unhappy
about prices rising within the game.

240
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,079
<i>But it seems like maybe you're
squeezing users for more money</i>

241
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,639
<i>to, uh, inflate your stock.</i>

242
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,759
Come on. You're tossing
hardballs already?

243
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,519
Let's... let's... Look around.

244
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,279
You see what I've built.
Check out the stats.

245
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,920
35 million users and rising.

246
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,240
Give or take the odd bandit.

247
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,519
The what?

248
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,959
No, just this morning, I
was on the <i>Infinity</i> forum

249
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,679
reading a complaint
from a player

250
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,679
who was robbed by two
anonymous "bottomholes."

251
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,759
I mean, the... his
words, not mine.

252
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,159
<i>I was
briefed about that.</i>

253
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,479
That's a localized
issue being handled...

254
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,559
He said he injured
one, and she bled?

255
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,599
<i>Sorry?</i>

256
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,359
I mean, famously, there's no
blood in your game, right?

257
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,559
So why might an anonymous
character suddenly bleed?

258
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,319
Uh, I don't know. He put
a patch? You tell me.

259
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,679
I'm the one asking.

260
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,679
Kris, did you come here to
grill me about a fucking bug?

261
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,079
I'll get to that. First, I wanna
circle back to Robert Daly.

262
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,519
That's really why I'm here.

263
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,360
<i>I'm gonna show you something.</i>

264
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,359
Okay, what is that? Why
are you do... Why... What is that?

265
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,159
<i>That's taken from bodycam
footage from the first responder</i>

266
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,079
<i>who found Mr. Daly's corpse.</i>

267
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,839
<i>Um, Bob and
I were really close.</i>

268
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,159
That's fucking triggering
me. I don't wanna see that.

269
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,959
Do you, um... Do you see that...
that object on his desk there?

270
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,159
No, no, no.

271
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,279
That's a
DNA digital cloner.

272
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,999
That could be... that's a box.

273
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,719
- <i>It could be anything.</i>
<i>- No, they're very distinctive.</i>

274
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,399
There's only a few left since
the tech was banned globally

275
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,959
on human rights grounds.

276
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,119
I don't know what
something like that's for.

277
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,039
Okay, well, people use them to create
sentient digital clones of real people.

278
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,079
Usually so that they can abuse them.
Right? Like sick wish fulfillment stuff.

279
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,239
Very sick and horrifying.
Why are you...

280
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,639
Sure, so what I'm wondering
is what was Robert Daly,

281
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,399
the man at the
heart of <i>Infinity</i>,

282
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,359
your, um... your cofounder
and close personal friend,

283
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,319
what was he doing with this
outlawed tech, Mr. Walton?

284
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,519
I have no idea what Bob Daly was doing
in his personal life. And why are you...

285
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,200
Did Robert Daly copy illegal
clones into your game?

286
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,239
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

287
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,359
<i>Because if he did, and if
that's who's bleeding in there,</i>

288
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,999
this whole company is implicated,
including you, Mr. Walton.

289
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,519
That's a ridiculous
insinuation and a shitty lie.

290
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,559
And if you print even
a fucking word of this,

291
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,359
me and my lawyers will fuck
you into a barbed wire coffin.

292
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,399
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

293
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Great.

294
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,679
- Lucky for me, I can't prove it.
- No, you can't.

295
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,799
- Not yet.
<i>- Not fucking ever.</i>

296
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,039
<i>Kris, could you get the
fuck out of my building now?</i>

297
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,640
- It was lovely to meet you.
- It was my pleasure, dick.

298
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,480
Oh my God.

299
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,879
Ow!

300
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,359
Um, Nate, I got
us a good target.

301
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,880
<i>Like last time?</i>

302
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,999
Well, it's a solo player,

303
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,999
and she's got a whole lot of
credits, and she seems kind of new.

304
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,559
So I will meet you on
the bridge in five, okay?

305
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,840
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

306
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,240
Oh, and, uh, don't
tell Karl. Obviously.

307
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
<i>Copy that.</i>

308
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,239
Give me one good reason
why I can't join you on the mission.

309
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,239
You have no
idea what it is like out there.

310
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,999
I can't believe I have to say this
again. Our entire existence is a crime.

311
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,159
If we are caught, we
get deleted like that.

312
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,439
I don't care. I don't care. I'm
just... I'm losing my mind here.

313
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,439
I don't do anything.
Everyone has a role.

314
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,319
I mean, you're the
captain, Captain.

315
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,919
Right? Dudani's space nerd.

316
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,799
I mean, Tulaska's got the
sexy alien thing going on.

317
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,359
We had to revert to her alien
skin to cure her eczema.

318
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,279
- We can't afford to change her back.
- But also, yes, is foxy.

319
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,399
- Even the intern's like a space marine.
- Intern? Hey, look. <i>Former</i> intern.

320
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,679
Stop, stop. Please stop.

321
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,680
- Please stop.
- I just do nothing!

322
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
Nothing!

323
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,839
And it sucks.

324
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,240
And I just wanna help.

325
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,760
Can I just sit in the chair
while you're gone? I mean...

326
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,600
- Yeah, you can sit in the chair.
- Fuck yeah. Thank you.

327
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,399
- Don't touch anything.
- Yeah, that's fair.

328
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,519
Cool. Why would... Not
gonna touch anything.

329
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,239
Dudani, load the missiles.

330
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,680
- Don't give orders.
- I wasn't...

331
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,920
- You ready?
- Uh-huh.

332
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,280
Okay, Dudani, send us down.

333
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,200
- Send them down, Dudani.
- Karl, I say it.

334
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,880
Send us down.

335
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Teleporting.

336
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,359
Coast is clear.

337
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,399
Activating <i>Real
Housewives of Atlanta.</i>

338
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,000
- What are we up to?
- Season 15, episode 5.

339
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,400
God, not this show anymore.

340
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,960
- I got a signal.
- Yeah?

341
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,520
Yeah, okay. It's that way.

342
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,039
Kabir! All right, I actually do need you
to fix that rogue bandit problem now.

343
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,319
- Where the fuck is Kabir? Kabir!
- I totally did that.

344
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,119
- Where's Kabir?
- Probably at home, I guess.

345
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,120
- Why is he at home right now?
- He quit.

346
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,840
He told you he quit?

347
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,320
He told his monitor.

348
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,159
I'm gonna fetch my bug-out bag
and fly to Belize. I need a new passport.

349
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,959
- Jesus Christ, okay. Jesus Christ.
- Sir?

350
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,719
- Mr. Walton.
- This is not a good time.

351
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,680
I can help with the whole bandit
issue that Dudani was looking into.

352
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,759
Didn't hear you knock. Come
on in. Sorry. Yeah, come in.

353
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,159
- Um, that's... It's good to see you again.
- Yeah.

354
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,280
How can you help?

355
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,559
We need to ID the bastards.

356
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,599
We totally need to ID
those bastards. How?

357
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,559
I think I can do that, but I
would need unrestricted access.

358
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,999
- Permission granted.
- You didn't hear what I need access to.

359
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,999
- You have all you could ever need.
- I need access to Kabir's complaint log.

360
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,319
How about less talking and more
doing? You have the access.

361
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,079
So, please, just go over there.

362
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,240
Please fucking help me. Now.

363
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,639
There
she is. I'll go this way.

364
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,760
You go that way and wait
for my signal, okay?

365
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,480
Come
on out, you shithead!

366
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,959
<i>And I put "love Marlo."</i>

367
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,839
<i>It's... I'm gonna post this.</i>

368
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,520
I love her. She's such a bitch.

369
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,719
<i>The Cleveland girl
was ready to get on the phone</i>

370
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,039
<i>and call Pookie'n nem to come
over there and whup your ass.</i>

371
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,039
<i>She'll get me f♪♪♪♪♪ up.</i>

372
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,199
<i>Because I'm snapping, and
I've never snapped in my life.</i>

373
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,999
<i>I'm straight. It ain't
even no ♪♪♪♪ to me no more.</i>

374
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Is that a party
request? Who did that?

375
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,759
I thought it was for
music and a disco ball.

376
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,919
It is player invite, idiot.
You want to get us killed?

377
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,519
- No.
- Okay, I canceled it.

378
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,359
See? No harm, no foul.

379
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,599
- That's a good beep, right?
- Bad beep. Inbound ship detected.

380
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,759
Prepping for hyperwarp.
Get them out of there.

381
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,120
Okay, I'm calling them. Code
red. I repeat, code red.

382
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,280
<i>Nanette, can you hear me?</i>

383
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,199
<i>Code
red. I repeat, code...</i>

384
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,200
They're not answering.

385
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,400
Uh, we got company. Player
tag is "MetallicaFan."

386
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,679
Why is it just staring at us?

387
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,799
Ships cannot stare.

388
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,280
You think that doesn't
feel like it's staring?

389
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,919
- Drop it! Credits, now!
- What?

390
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,799
Shit. Goddamn!

391
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,560
You poke your head out again,
I'll fucking pop it off of ya!

392
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,959
Hey there.

393
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,000
Where's your player tag, mate?

394
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,679
You cheating or what?

395
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,680
We just
want credits, okay?

396
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,079
We need them more than you.

397
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,399
Please. Please believe me.

398
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,640
God, look at your leg.

399
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,119
That looks nasty.

400
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,960
If
you're gonna kill me,

401
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,799
just fucking do it.

402
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,920
You are so dramatic.

403
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,199
But if you say so.

404
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,920
Christ.

405
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,919
Okay.

406
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,360
Resume game.

407
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,279
- You good? We gotta go.
- Yeah, thank you, Nate.

408
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,079
- We need the credit stick.
- What?

409
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,399
Get the credit stick.

410
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,880
- It's right there.
- Here!

411
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,319
Hi.

412
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,639
Fucking hell, mate.

413
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,759
I
can't get a clear shot.

414
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
Ow!

415
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,600
Okay. We gotta go, come on.

416
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080
Oi!

417
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,840
Gimme the gun.

418
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,640
Shit!

419
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,999
Fuck! You're
fucking shitting me.

420
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,159
Up you
get. Let's go! Let's go!

421
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,959
Incoming transmission.

422
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,679
Tulaska,
patch them through.

423
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,759
- You're not the captain.
- I'm in the chair.

424
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,960
I will talk to them.

425
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,479
<i>Yo, where's
your player tags?</i>

426
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,160
Greetings, Starship Metallica.

427
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,000
We, too, are huge
fans of this band.

428
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,239
<i>- Oh yeah?</i>
- Yes.

429
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,120
<i>So what's your favorite
Metallica track?</i>

430
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,879
Okay, should I say...
should I say all of them?

431
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,159
- No.
- I know one.

432
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,999
It was on <i>Jeopardy!</i>
Something about sand.

433
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,559
"Exit... Exit Sandman."

434
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,160
"Exit Sandman."

435
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,880
Oh, "Enter Sandman."

436
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,319
Shields, 70%.

437
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,719
Holy fuck!

438
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,600
Fuck!
Why won't she just die?

439
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,479
Shields, 56%.

440
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,400
Performing evasive maneuver.

441
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,279
Go to hyperspeed!
Hyperspeed, go.

442
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,800
We don't have the credits!

443
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,239
Tulaska, get them out of there!

444
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,000
They're nowhere near the portal.

445
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,039
- Come on. Hurry!
- Guys, get us out of here!

446
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,160
Tulaska!

447
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,440
- She's coming!
- Tulaska, come on!

448
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
Teleporting.

449
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,279
Tulaska!

450
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,039
No, I will fucking kill you!

451
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,240
Shit!

452
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Fuck!

453
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,440
I will bloody report youse!

454
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,240
- What happened, man?
- It was him!

455
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,000
- Is that enough?
- Yes!

456
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,960
Get out!

457
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,799
Hyper warp, now!

458
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Whoa!

459
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,919
<i>Come
on out, you shithead!</i>

460
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,600
<i>Oh my God!</i>

461
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,799
- Oh fuck!
- Ah sweet goddamn!

462
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,120
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. Don't worry.

463
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,120
It's fine. Don't worry.

464
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,800
<i>Sweet goddamn!</i>

465
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,481
<i>Poke your head out
again, I'll fucking pop it off of ya!</i>

466
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,399
<i>Hey there.</i>

467
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,119
<i>Where's your player tag, mate?</i>

468
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,359
<i>You cheating or what?</i>

469
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,239
<i>We just
want credits, okay?</i>

470
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,720
<i>We need them more than you.
Please. Please believe me.</i>

471
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
Info? Come in.

472
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
What did you get?

473
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,120
I've... I've ID'd the bandits.

474
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,599
Who are they?

475
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,879
Don't freak out.

476
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,119
Why would I freak... I don't
freak out. I never freak out.

477
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,679
- I think that one of them is Nate.
- Nate?

478
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,560
- Mm-hmm.
- Who is that?

479
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,160
Um, as in, our Nate.

480
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,760
The intern Nate.

481
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,559
The coffee order guy.

482
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,639
- The fucking coffee guy?
- Yeah.

483
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,279
That motherhumper
is so fucking fired.

484
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,320
Excuse...

485
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,840
No, go. I'm good.

486
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
And the other one is me.

487
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
You?

488
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,000
I think Robert Daly
cloned a bunch of us.

489
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,040
How would he even...

490
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,640
I know that he
had the equipment.

491
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,280
Okay, how do you know that?

492
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:23,040
Because I was in Daly's
apartment the night that he died.

493
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,000
Oh my God! You two were fucking?

494
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,359
- No.
- No? Okay.

495
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,479
So, um, someone hacked into my,
uh... into my PhotoCloud account

496
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,239
and then stole some very
intimate images of me.

497
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,759
- Can I see the images?
- No.

498
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,239
- Just, I mean, to help us figure this out.
- No. No, no.

499
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,120
And they used those images to blackmail
me into breaking into his apartment.

500
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,359
- And when I...
- You killed him.

501
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,199
No, no. No, no. I... He
was alive when I left.

502
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,879
- That's what a murderer would say.
- No, I didn't touch him. Okay?

503
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,479
They had me break in,

504
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,079
and they had me steal all of
these... like, DNA samples

505
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,359
that he kept in these little
Ziploc baggies in his fridge.

506
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,599
They have our names on.

507
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,079
- Look, my name.
- Jesus Christ.

508
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,399
There was Nate's name.

509
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,959
There was a bunch of us
from the office. Even you.

510
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,319
Wait, I was in there?

511
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,559
Yeah, the only one that
I didn't recognize was

512
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,479
a lollipop labeled "Tommy,"
and I don't know who that is.

513
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,479
Tommy's my son.

514
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,320
What the fuck was Bob doing?

515
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,399
Daddy!

516
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,599
He was making copies of us. I
don't really wanna think about why.

517
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,600
But, anyway, there's something
else, which is that, um,

518
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,119
when I was blackmailed,
the voice was disguised.

519
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,799
<i>Nanette Cole, we've
hacked your photo cloud account.</i>

520
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,840
But I hacked the telco
and traced the call.

521
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,959
And, uh, it had been patched
through an <i>Infinity</i> build

522
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,920
on a computer that
matched Daly's IP address.

523
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,200
The call was coming from
inside Daly's computer.

524
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,879
Wait, why would Bob blackmail you
into... breaking into his apartment?

525
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,520
Because it wasn't Bob.

526
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
It was us.

527
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,760
It was copies... of us.

528
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,640
And I... I think

529
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,199
that somehow, somewhere,

530
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,080
those copies are now
loose in <i>Infinity.</i>

531
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,759
Oh...

532
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,280
Yeah, it's a lot to take in.

533
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,359
Can you locate them?

534
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,759
No. You can't. It's not... You
can't do that without player tags.

535
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,640
Nanette, I need you to locate
them. So how do we do it?

536
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,399
Maybe if I had access
to Daly's home computer,

537
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,880
but that's, like, in the bottom
of a landfill now, right?

538
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
Oh, unless it's not.

539
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,239
- Ow.
- Sit still.

540
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,799
- I am.
- So sit stiller.

541
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,720
It's kind
of a repetitive view.

542
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,039
Because it's a looping animation to
give the player something to watch

543
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,279
while the next location
loads in the background.

544
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,079
Oh, I didn't know that.

545
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,639
He's told you, like, 17 times.

546
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,559
Well,
it didn't sink in.

547
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,239
Maybe if you paid attention, you'd
know what a party invite was.

548
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,679
- Well, maybe you...
- We wouldn't have almost died.

549
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,720
Guys!

550
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,919
Okay, listen, I get it. We
are all a little on edge.

551
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,879
But if you are gonna take a swing
at anyone, take a swing at me.

552
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,119
- I led us here.
- Hey, you don't have to...

553
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,400
And I really hoped that I could find
a way out of this, but I... haven't.

554
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,799
And I can't see a way out.

555
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,639
We could always throw
ourselves out of the airlock.

556
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,119
I've got an idea.

557
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,639
What if we flew back into
Daly's computer? Right?

558
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,199
Even if we were psychotic enough to
want to do that, it's not possible.

559
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,479
- Why?
- Daly's bubble universe got deleted.

560
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,239
And even if it hadn't been,
the wormhole was temporary.

561
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,159
- It'd all still be sealed off.
- Okay, then it's sealed off.

562
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,800
Well, I'm trying. I'm
throwing an idea out there.

563
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,679
Yeah.

564
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,160
Oh my God.

565
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,919
- Oh my God.
- That's your Eureka face.

566
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,879
Yeah.

567
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,119
Okay, Daly had his own private
development build of <i>Infinity</i>

568
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,399
on his computer where he
could do what he wanted.

569
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,519
- Like you said, it was sealed off?
- Correct.

570
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,679
Okay, so why don't we
just do what he did?

571
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,719
You mean...

572
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,039
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,

573
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,519
but if we can access
the game's source code,

574
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,199
we can compile a private
development build

575
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,679
of a whole universe
of our own, right?

576
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,119
- Using cloud storage onto virtual servers?
- Yes, yes, yes.

577
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,159
Then all we'd have to do is cut and
paste ourselves across the, um...

578
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,599
Sorry. Cut, paste? So we
could just go someplace else?

579
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,159
Yeah, we would enter a... a secure
and private and infinite universe,

580
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,399
and then we could just
shut the door behind us.

581
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,720
There'd be no more credits, no more
other players, no more threats.

582
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,039
It would just be us,
and we'd be safe.

583
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,079
Okay, so how do we access
this, uh, source code?

584
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,359
In the game, it
manifests as this.

585
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,080
- Karl, move.
- Okay.

586
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,679
Okay.

587
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,679
The Heart of Infinity<i>,</i>
an engine at the center of the universe

588
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,719
that creates and
maintains the whole thing.

589
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,399
Okay, so let's go.

590
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,519
Getting there is not the
problem. It's getting inside.

591
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,119
Only two people can access the core,
and one of them is Robert Daly.

592
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,839
<i>Who's dead.</i>

593
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,200
And the other one's Walton.

594
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,719
Double dead.

595
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,639
Yeah, but not in the real world.

596
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,079
The clone of Walton died, but the
original Walton is still alive,

597
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,719
so why don't we contact him
and persuade him to help us?

598
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,039
We're illegal clones
in his company's game.

599
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,159
We get discovered, the
feds throw him in jail.

600
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,999
Great. So no Walton, no hope.

601
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,399
Shall we, uh, revisit
the airlock idea?

602
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,480
Goddamn it.

603
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,559
It's not like we could go looking
through his stuff for clues.

604
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,000
His room's completely empty.

605
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,279
Sorry, what's empty?

606
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,360
His room. It's completely empty.

607
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,959
Walton can't have a
room on this ship.

608
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,280
He has a room. It's...
it's one floor below mine.

609
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,200
Why are you guys looking at me
weird? Is something on my face?

610
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,879
- Okay.
- This is all of Daly's stuff?

611
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,199
His heart stopped, ownership
transferred to the company.

612
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,000
So, legally, it's my stuff.

613
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,360
And it's mostly just Comic-Con garbage,
but I know that one of these is... yeah.

614
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
Yeah.

615
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,399
- That's his computer.
- Yeah, keep up.

616
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,119
- Can you get the cables out of the box?
- Cables? Okay.

617
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,520
Fetching you cables now?

618
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,679
See? No
Walton. No nothing.

619
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,040
Mm.

620
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,959
Okay. Wait. When we passed through
the wormhole, the ship reset itself.

621
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,839
With generic living quarters
assigned to every player alive.

622
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,959
But Walton burned up
before we passed through.

623
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,440
He shouldn't have a room at all.

624
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,960
Unless he's still alive.

625
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,399
How? He burned up in the jet.

626
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,119
What if one tiny piece of Walton got
carried through the wormhole in our wake?

627
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,399
Like one toenail, even.

628
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,919
Even if just one scorched
atom of James Walton

629
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,159
somehow got caught up in our
slipstream and followed us through.

630
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,759
Outside the ship,
loose in space.

631
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,919
Enough to make him
respawn as a new player.

632
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,039
Where do new players
spawn when they start?

633
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,799
- Not on a ship.
- A whole new planet!

634
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,199
Can you translate for those
who don't speak machine code?

635
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,800
Walton is still in the game,
and I know how to find him.

636
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,279
Okay. Everything has been wiped
from within. Almost everything.

637
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,999
It's like it ate itself.
But I have the crash log,

638
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,559
which proves that there were
clones on Daly's computer.

639
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,959
And I've got names.

640
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,440
There's you and me and Shania and
Kabir and Elena and Nate and Karl.

641
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
Who's Karl?

642
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,519
Okay, let me start up the game.

643
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,199
This is just a hunch,

644
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,639
but I think that if I can find a planet
that spawned at the same exact time

645
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,999
that his, um, system failed...

646
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,800
Oh. Yeah. Okay, I found one.

647
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,759
We left Daly's computer at one
minute to midnight on Christmas Eve.

648
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,239
If we find a new planet that
was created at that moment...

649
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,119
- Got one!
- Okay, that's where he is!

650
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,719
- Set sail, Nate!
- Yes, ma'am!

651
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,039
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Walton.

652
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,640
Nice nipples.

653
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,640
It's
me. It's Nanette.

654
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,600
Nanette Cole.

655
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,560
From the Callister.

656
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,599
Oh my God. You came for me. Hey!

657
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,639
Oh! It just
feels so good to squeeze.

658
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,039
Okay, let's... let's get
you back on the ship.

659
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,959
- Oh shit.
- Yeah.

660
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,559
- We can go back on the ship?
- Yes.

661
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,959
- We can catch up there, okay?
- Oh my God. Wait.

662
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,519
- Yeah, no. Let's go.
- I can't leave without Rocky.

663
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,720
Oh, who's Rocky?

664
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Okay.

665
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,959
All right. I've entered
the coordinates.

666
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,160
We're gonna go in.

667
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,559
Okay. How do we do this?

668
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,640
- You don't know how to play your game?
- No.

669
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,400
- I read.
- Just do what I do.

670
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
Enter game.

671
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,760
Oh, that's fun.

672
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
Um...

673
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,000
Enter game as well.

674
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,600
Oh shit.

675
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,480
Oh shit, this is so realistic.

676
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,080
Holy...

677
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,159
I have a blaster?

678
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,639
It
has been so wild.

679
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,359
One moment, I was just burning
alive in the thrusters,

680
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,399
and then the next moment,
I just appeared out there.

681
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,040
- Mm-hmm.
- All alone.

682
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,360
- For a very long time.
- Yeah.

683
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,479
With only Rocky to
keep me company.

684
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,520
Only Rocky to keep me sane.

685
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,800
Wanna say hi?

686
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,960
He's nice.

687
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,080
I'll pack up.

688
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,359
Hmm. Rocky's got a
hole in the back.

689
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,960
Really? I hadn't noticed.

690
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,039
Don't drop him on his face!

691
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,639
I don't need
to hear that. We've got to go.

692
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,679
- Get Rocky.
- And this.

693
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,560
- You can bring one skin.
- Okay.

694
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,239
Oh my God! Oh my God!

695
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,680
Oh.

696
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,439
It's us! It's us.

697
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,720
I mean, it's... it's them.

698
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,760
Oh my
God. What am I wearing?

699
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,559
Not enough.

700
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,200
- Wrap it up, ticktock.
- Okay. I'm just gonna...

701
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,560
- I look so... capable.
- Mm.

702
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,879
Okay, so how do
you wanna do this?

703
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,159
Want me to kill your
clone, then you kill mine?

704
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,839
- What? No.
- Oh my God, you're right.

705
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,479
It would be so much more
cathartic if we kill ourselves.

706
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,079
- No. What? We're not gonna kill anybody.
- Then why are we here?

707
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,639
Oh Jesus.

708
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,320
- Oh my God.
- Come on out.

709
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Hi.

710
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,480
Don't shoot. I, uh...

711
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,520
I come in peace.

712
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,440
Okay. I come in peace.

713
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,760
Oh my God. Hi.

714
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,880
- Do you need a hand?
- What?

715
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,480
No, no, no.

716
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,400
Hi. It's me.

717
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,680
I mean... Uh, I... I'm you.

718
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,599
No, you're you. I'm me.

719
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,079
Yeah, but I'm the real you.

720
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,599
That's subjective.

721
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,239
Uh, why are you here?

722
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,360
Oh, uh...

723
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,479
- Okay, we just wanna talk.
- Who's we?

724
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,480
Yeah.

725
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,040
Yo, namaste.

726
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,440
What's up, nerds?

727
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:43,999
Drop it!

728
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,360
Oh, yeah, of course. Don't even know
why I had it. Didn't ask for it.

729
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,520
Uh, wow, that's a...
that's a big pink gun.

730
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,720
Glad I'm keeping trim.

731
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,079
<i>...all this.</i>

732
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:00,000
Okay, so one more time. Not that
I care, but... who's mad at who?

733
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,639
Marlo is mad at Kenya, who
threatened to call the cops on her.

734
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,119
Monyetta is mad at Marlo for
trying to slam a door in her face.

735
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,239
- What?
- The door was heavy.

736
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,640
- Oh.
- They're teleporting back.

737
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,199
Do you think Walton has an
extra helmet I can borrow?

738
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,680
That's strange.

739
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,359
You hit duplicate by mistake?

740
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,679
Uh...

741
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,840
I missed you guys
so much.

742
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,039
Walton fixed the
thrusters, and then he got incinerated.

743
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,760
So we made it through the wormhole,
leaving Daly behind... to die.

744
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,919
Sorry. I... I'm who
led us out of there?

745
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,719
Like, I'm... the captain?

746
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,319
You know, you being shocked by
that does us both a disservice,

747
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,400
but yeah.

748
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,920
Right.

749
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,639
Um, and so why are you
guys robbing people?

750
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,120
Because, thanks
to me, or... you,

751
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,039
um, aren't you...
aren't you safe now?

752
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,279
Naive you is so adorable.

753
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,479
When we were trapped on Daly's computer,
we only had to deal with one sociopath.

754
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:17,439
- Now we've got a universe full of them.
- Ready to kill us at any time.

755
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,799
Right. That's...

756
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,639
Awful? That's what
you were gonna say?

757
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,840
Yeah, that is what
I was gonna say.

758
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,719
- And I'm so...
- No, no. Stop, stop.

759
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,239
Don't, don't, don't say, "I'm
sorry." I always used to say that.

760
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,760
- Don't say that.
- But I... but I am... I am sorry.

761
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,679
You know, I had no idea
that this was happening...

762
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,079
Well, how... how could you?

763
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,200
I mean, you have been...
been enjoying your life.

764
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,959
Our life, really.

765
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,039
Well, I... I wouldn't say that I've
been enjoying my life, actually.

766
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,999
- It's been rough.
- Your life's been rough?

767
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,479
- Well, yeah. I mean, you blackmailed me...
- We had no other choice.

768
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,759
You forced me to break
into Daly's apartment...

769
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,279
- You know we get shot at?
- That's not my fault.

770
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,400
Nanettes, hey, calm down. When
arguing, one at a time, please.

771
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,359
Okay, look. You know, we
have been staying under the radar.

772
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,919
Yeah. I get it.

773
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,959
Um, you're illegal.

774
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,399
But now you know that we exist.

775
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,479
Of course, we'll do
anything to help.

776
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,919
We need access to the
Heart of Infinity.

777
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,280
Yes. The game engine?

778
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,999
Okay. Well, Mr. Walton needs
to give permission for that.

779
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,359
- But you can do that, right?
- Uh, wrong.

780
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,520
Whoo!

781
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,759
- Fuck!
- Stop! What are you doing? Stop!

782
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,999
They're illegal.

783
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,279
No, no, they're human! Stop!

784
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,160
Please, it's a fucking game!

785
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,119
Holy shit!

786
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,759
Oh man.

787
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,159
- No!
- That's awesome.

788
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,440
Hey.

789
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,320
Wait! No, no, no!

790
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,920
Oh, that is real.

791
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,640
Where'd that thing go?

792
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,560
Where's the nubbin?

793
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,799
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

794
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,599
I didn't know... Oh my God. I didn't
know that he was gonna do that.

795
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,560
I'm sorry. I'm so
sorry. I'm so sorry.

796
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,159
I didn't... I...

797
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,599
I didn't know. I'm so sorry.

798
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,680
Where the fuck is that nubbin?

799
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,920
Sorry.

800
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,639
You have to go. You have to stop
him from coming back! Just go!

801
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,160
Exit game!

802
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,199
Hey.

803
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,119
Ow! Goddamn it!

804
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,960
Ow! You work for
me. What the fuck?

805
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,879
You murdering piece of shit!

806
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,160
They're not humans.

807
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,159
- Come on.
- Neither are you.

808
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,519
Hey, give me that.
Where are you going?

809
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,199
Hey! I need your help!

810
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,799
To get back in! To get
the f... the other...

811
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,879
Fuck!

812
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,200
Wait! Fucking...

813
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,199
Listen, you may not like it,
but we have to get rid of them.

814
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,399
You don't get to tell
me what to do. I quit.

815
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,840
- We're both implicated. Let's...
- It's your company, not mine.

816
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,879
You were in Daly's apartment the
night he died. There'll be evidence.

817
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,039
- So what?
- So? What if that reporter finds out?

818
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,919
- Maybe he should.
- Just talk to me.

819
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,360
- Don't touch me.
- Okay.

820
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,719
We both have shit
to lose, Nanette.

821
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,719
Walk away or I call him right
now. Kris El Masry, I have his...

822
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,799
- Gimme the phone. No!
- Hey! Just... Don't!

823
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,560
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

824
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,280
I'm begging you. Okay?

825
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,719
I'm gonna lose everything.

826
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,880
And I can't find them without
you, so please, help me.

827
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,600
Okay, how much you want? 100K?

828
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,359
Two hundred?

829
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,720
You are pathetic.

830
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,519
Two fifty? Two seventy-five.

831
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,800
And don't even think...

832
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,120
Is she okay?

833
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,640
Somebody call an ambulance.

834
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,600
- Oh my God, is she okay?
- Somebody call 911.

835
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,920
Hey... hey, you should call somebody.
Do you have a phone? Call somebody.

836
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,240
Jesus.

837
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,520
What happened with Karl,

838
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,880
it's not your fault.

839
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,520
We both know that's not true.

840
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,160
So what you're saying is,
you rescued me because

841
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,560
you can't enter the Heart
of Infinity without me?

842
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,160
Uh-huh.

843
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,920
Oh.

844
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,759
Uh...

845
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,120
Also, we missed you.

846
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,239
Great.

847
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,320
- She still out there?
- Mm-hmm.

848
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,080
What?

849
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,599
You're disgusting.

850
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,359
That wasn't me. That was the other me.
That's the outside world me. He sucks.

851
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,400
I know.

852
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,799
Okay, so why am I disgusting?

853
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,559
Because ball sack visible.

854
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,200
Oh sh...

855
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:06,280
I'm gonna go... and...
put more clothes on,

856
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,320
clean up, and have a shave.

857
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,880
My God, I look amazing
in this outfit.

858
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,679
Oh, hey, Nanette.

859
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,919
Um...

860
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,559
- I have to tell you something.
- Yeah, shoot.

861
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,559
You wanna get into the
Heart of Infinity, right?

862
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,879
It's the only way we'll be safe.

863
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,039
Okay. You need to
know what's in there.

864
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,480
It's the source code, right?

865
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,920
Not exactly.

866
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,560
What do you mean?

867
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,640
Let's do it over a drink.

868
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,680
Uh, this is something I've
never told anyone before.

869
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,600
Twelve years ago...

870
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,600
that's when it all began.

871
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,319
Okay, just stay in the
car. This won't take long.

872
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,239
<i>I was young and
hungry, objectively sexy,</i>

873
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,240
and I was high on
my dad's trust fund,

874
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,520
just looking for
shit to invest in.

875
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,039
<i>And then I got this tip
about this genius coder</i>

876
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,200
<i>who was doing something
groundbreaking.</i>

877
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,280
Hey.

878
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,280
Hi. Uh...

879
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,959
Sorry, I spilled
my chocolate milk.

880
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,199
Oh, you sure did.
That's fun. Hmm.

881
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,799
- Are you...
- James Walton, yeah.

882
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,839
- We talked on the phone. You're, uh...
- Robert Daly.

883
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,120
- Yes, sir.
- That's right.

884
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,120
You kinda look more
like a Bob to me.

885
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,680
Mind if I call you Bob?

886
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,240
Sure.

887
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,040
I hear you got
something to show me.

888
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,999
Do you wanna see it?

889
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,079
I would love to.

890
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,800
Thank you.

891
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,999
<i>Bob's garage was
just what you'd expect.</i>

892
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,519
<i>A shrine to his one
singular obsession.</i>

893
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,280
I'll
just get it booted up.

894
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,519
Ah shit.

895
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,840
- Do you need a license for this badass?
- Careful.

896
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,079
That is a real
Bargradian cutlass.

897
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,279
Okay.

898
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,439
Commander Scarfax
won it in battle.

899
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,039
Don't know what that means.

900
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,080
- It's from <i>Space Fleet</i>. The TV show?
- Mm-hmm. Oh.

901
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,599
It was way ahead of its time.

902
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,319
That sounds... fun.

903
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,719
Felt like they created a whole
universe for that series,

904
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,919
and it made me wanna
try and do the same.

905
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,359
And they say I have a
God complex.

906
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,320
Just let me put this here.

907
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,520
- Wow.
- Does that feel okay?

908
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,320
This won't take long.

909
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,760
- Ready?
- Sure.

910
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,760
Three, two, one.

911
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,360
<i>I had never
seen anything like it.</i>

912
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,919
It was totally groundbreaking.

913
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,880
And I could see right away
that... Bob was a genius.

914
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,319
Oh my God.

915
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,359
Oh shit. Fuck. It felt like I
was on an actual planet, man.

916
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,079
It's... it's pretty
immersive, huh?

917
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,039
Where's the gameplay? What do you do?
When do I get to... to shoot people, or...

918
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:48,439
What I'm going for is... is... is more
of an experience, really, than a game.

919
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,879
Okay, that's fun, I guess.

920
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,679
But, Bob, if you can roll
this out for online play,

921
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,999
that is a fuck ton of gold.

922
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,839
That's not really what
<i>Space Fleet</i> was about.

923
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,000
Fuck <i>Space Fleet.</i>

924
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,359
With respect. I say that
with the utmost respect.

925
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,720
But, Bob, this is our IP.

926
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,919
- How many planets do you have?
- Right now, four.

927
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,720
Okay, we're gonna need, like, I
don't know... 50 before launch.

928
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,879
Bob, listen, we have to expand.

929
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,560
With more scale, we
get more subscriptions.

930
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,640
Bob, Bob,

931
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,240
you said you wanted
to create a universe.

932
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,640
Now is your chance, kid.

933
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,759
I... guess.

934
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,960
Yeah, it is.

935
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,920
So I moved into the
garage with Bob,

936
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,400
and our startup started up.

937
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:44,000
Bob worked on the game,
and I... worked on Bob.

938
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,840
<i>Only nine planets?</i>

939
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,959
We are so far
behind target, Bob.

940
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,039
Can't you just write a routine
that fucking auto-generates them?

941
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,839
Just shits them out.
Planet, planet, planet.

942
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,639
I would still need to
check each one personally.

943
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,640
So?

944
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,399
It's kind of impossible.

945
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,839
There's all the other systems
I have to stay across,

946
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,720
and there's only one of me.

947
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,759
Hold that thought.

948
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,079
<i>Before I met Bob,</i>

949
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,479
<i>I had invested in all
kinds of new inventions.</i>

950
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,639
<i>Some worked.</i>

951
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,720
<i>Most didn't.</i>

952
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,320
<i>One thing never even
made it to the market.</i>

953
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,999
It came out of
the porn industry,

954
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,640
and, uh, it was outlawed
before we launched.

955
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,679
It was a DNA cloner.

956
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:31,879
Bingo.

957
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,199
It was designed to
replicate people in VR.

958
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,639
So with a hair or a lip smear,
you could create your very own

959
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,479
virtual sentient fuck buddy
out of whoever you wanted.

960
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,639
You wanted to fuck Robert Daly?

961
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,039
No, no.

962
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,080
I wanted to duplicate him.

963
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,959
<i>With a copy
of Bob inside the code,</i>

964
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,399
<i>fused with the engine,</i>

965
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,680
<i>he could essentially work
24-7 in a time bubble.</i>

966
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,280
<i>Building the universe
piece by piece.</i>

967
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,040
<i>And he agreed.</i>

968
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,840
Whoa, whoa.

969
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,279
Are you saying there's a clone
of Daly inside the game engine?

970
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,600
I'm saying I put a clone of
Daly inside the game engine.

971
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,559
That's what's at the
Heart of Infinity.

972
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,199
The whole spinny structure,
that's fucking window dressing.

973
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,639
That's a distraction.

974
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,239
Inside there is Bob's
enslaved consciousness,

975
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,559
unable to leave.

976
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,640
Just building out <i>Infinity</i>.

977
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,800
For infinity.

978
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,720
That's dark, man.

979
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,400
That's why the real
you is so freaked.

980
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,320
The code his company rests on
is an illegal clone con job.

981
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,599
She... yeah, she's in danger.

982
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,679
Who is?

983
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,680
Me.

984
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,999
The outside me. She has no
idea who she's dealing with.

985
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,879
Will you call my outer
world cell phone?

986
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,480
- We agreed. Never contact the outside.
- Do it. Please.

987
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,479
Doctor, her
phone's ringing.

988
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,759
Hello.

989
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:13,119
Uh, I'm... I'm calling for,
um, Nanette Cole. Who's this?

990
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,879
Dr. Garcia, St.
Juniper Hospital.

991
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,079
<i>Are you a friend of Ms. Cole?</i>

992
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:21,039
I'm... her... sister.

993
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,360
Is she okay?

994
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,600
I'm afraid Ms. Cole has
been in an accident.

995
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,560
Uh-huh?

996
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,360
Is she, um...

997
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,079
How... how is she?

998
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,239
I think it's best if I
speak to you face-to-face.

999
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,920
<i>How soon can you get here?</i>

1000
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,320
I'm, uh, very far. I'm...

1001
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,600
very far away.

1002
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,720
Uh, can you just please...
just tell me how she is?

1003
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,480
She's in a very deep coma.

1004
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,680
A coma?

1005
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,279
<i>We hooked her up to the
temporal monitoring system</i>

1006
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,039
in case there's any uptick
in cognitive function,

1007
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:05,080
but she's suffered
extensive brain trauma.

1008
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,359
<i>Even if she does
regain consciousness,</i>

1009
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,760
<i>we're not sure how much
will be left of her.</i>

1010
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,560
I'm sorry.

1011
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,679
I know you said you're
some distance away,

1012
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,960
but I think you need to
come and say goodbye.

1013
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,160
Tulaska, please end the call.

1014
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,360
Hey, are you okay?

1015
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,960
Dudani, set a course for
the Heart of Infinity.

1016
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,279
Hey, are you sure? Look, you
just had a hell of a shock...

1017
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,719
Just... just do it.

1018
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,160
- Nanette...
- Now!

1019
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,640
Oh...

1020
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,079
Hello?

1021
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,200
Hey, Kabir, it's me. Um...

1022
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:46,799
I need help.

1023
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,319
Yeah, that's why I quit.

1024
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,920
<i>I will give you a raise, okay?</i>

1025
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,439
Five thousand dollars.

1026
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,160
<i>Per month?</i>

1027
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,439
Yeah, yeah.

1028
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,799
Yes, yes!

1029
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,879
<i>But I need your help first, okay? Just...
just a little, um</i>... <i>tech support.</i>

1030
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,840
- At 4:00 a.m.?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1031
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:05,919
Go on.

1032
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,919
Say I'm playing <i>Infinity,</i> right?

1033
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,479
You
never play <i>Infinity.</i>

1034
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,359
Say I was playing <i>Infinity,</i> and I
got, I don't know, shot in the head

1035
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,999
and kicked out of the game.

1036
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,119
How do I get back in?

1037
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,999
You kidding me? That's
the most basic...

1038
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,400
Just tell me how I do
it! Sorry. Do... How?

1039
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,599
You put your nubbin on,
and you say "resume game."

1040
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,079
Okay, and I pop up where?

1041
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,120
Where were you when
you got fragged?

1042
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,679
- Fragged?
<i>- That means shot.</i>

1043
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,839
Oh, yeah. No, I know.

1044
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,479
I was fragged on a ship.

1045
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,319
So you'd just
respawn on that ship.

1046
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:35,840
On the same ship I was on?

1047
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,879
Well, in your
quarters, but yeah.

1048
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,039
That's fantastic.
That's so cool.

1049
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,759
It's basic functionality.

1050
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,999
Without quick resume, you'd
have to search the galaxy.

1051
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,840
- Kabir?
<i>- Yeah?</i>

1052
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,120
I have one more question.

1053
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,280
Go on.

1054
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,559
Okay,
that shit's impressive.

1055
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,400
If you
like spinny bullshit.

1056
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,639
It was designed to
look awe-inspiring.

1057
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,640
The more impressive it appears,
the fewer questions people'd ask.

1058
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:12,160
No one would suspect
Bob was in there.

1059
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,159
We can teleport
only one of us in.

1060
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,439
Walton just has to approve entry
by placing his palm on the scanner.

1061
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,480
I'm ready.

1062
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,959
It's not like you're
gonna go in there and just tap some keys.

1063
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,999
Daly has been in there alone
with godlike powers for years.

1064
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,400
Just approve it.

1065
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,200
Okay.

1066
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,600
Dudani, send me in.

1067
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,720
Teleporting.

1068
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,800
Hey.

1069
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,840
Hi.

1070
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,040
Oh, uh...

1071
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,080
I'm sorry.

1072
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,840
Um...

1073
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,560
I'm... I'm Robert
Daly. What's your name?

1074
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:05,879
Nanette.

1075
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:06,960
Nanette Cole.

1076
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:08,560
Nanette Cole.

1077
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,720
Well,

1078
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,719
welcome.

1079
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,920
Stop pacing.

1080
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:31,759
- It's bad energy.
- God knows what's going on down there.

1081
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,360
Yeah, well, whatever
it is, it's your fault.

1082
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,200
Uh...

1083
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,719
I'm gonna go meditate.
Clear my head.

1084
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,080
Yeah, you do that.

1085
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,080
Could you tell me
if she calls in?

1086
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,840
That was mean.

1087
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,400
So, Nanette, how
did you get in here?

1088
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,840
Only me and Mr. Walton
can grant access.

1089
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,560
He let me in.

1090
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,799
- He did?
- Mm-hmm.

1091
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,360
Oh. Do you want one?

1092
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,440
No, I'm okay.

1093
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:40,080
Did he say when he might be stopping
by? 'Cause I've got so much to show him.

1094
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:43,440
I... I built a whole universe.

1095
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,760
He didn't say.

1096
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,200
Do you wanna sit?

1097
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,360
Sorry about the mess.

1098
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,160
The truth is, you're the only
visitor I've had since I started.

1099
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,559
I don't even know the
way time works here.

1100
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,680
It's maybe...

1101
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,639
500 years?

1102
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,079
But if Mr. Walton sent you,
it must be very important.

1103
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,080
It is.

1104
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:17,759
He knows I'm here, but I actually came
because I wanted to see you personally.

1105
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,280
You did? Oh.

1106
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:20,960
Why?

1107
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,319
To ask you a favor.

1108
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,320
Okay.

1109
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,800
The thing is, I have every
reason not to trust you.

1110
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,680
Why?

1111
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,720
Because I have met you before.

1112
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,840
You mean out there?

1113
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:38,960
Not exactly.

1114
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,880
Well, what happened?

1115
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,560
It's a, uh...

1116
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,880
complex story.

1117
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,360
I like stories.

1118
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,200
Hey.

1119
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,960
Go and
apologize to him.

1120
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,679
Hey, listen, man,
about earlier, I...

1121
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,440
Skim soy latte, no sugar.

1122
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,480
Why did you give
me a coffee order?

1123
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:34,760
Uh...

1124
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,600
I just... really like coffee.

1125
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,360
You know in here I'm
not the intern, right?

1126
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,279
Of course.

1127
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,880
So what's my first name?

1128
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,720
Huh? What?

1129
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,320
My first name.

1130
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
What is it?

1131
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:55,639
Neil?

1132
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,119
- What the hell are you doing?
- Nate, what the fuck?

1133
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,999
- He's not Walton!
- I am Walton.

1134
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,439
He's not <i>our</i> Walton! Hey. Hey!

1135
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,239
Where is he, huh?
Where's our Walton?

1136
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,320
Stop him!

1137
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:10,759
He's not me.

1138
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:11,840
Exit game.

1139
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,359
Fuck you, coffee guy!

1140
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,839
He hit me.

1141
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,239
I hit me. Hit I.

1142
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,560
I hit myself. It was awful.

1143
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,919
Guys, I think he
sent a mass invite.

1144
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,480
What? Who to?

1145
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,839
Everyone we've ever robbed.

1146
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,119
Fuckers.

1147
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,879
How do I watch you die?

1148
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,039
All right, Kabir. Options.

1149
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,360
Spectate.

1150
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,000
Spectate...

1151
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,680
Oh, hi, you guys.

1152
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,440
Let's have it.

1153
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:06,880
Enter game.

1154
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,799
Enter game.

1155
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,280
Inbound vessels.

1156
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,360
Lots of them.

1157
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:16,840
Shit!

1158
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,999
Tulaska, ready
the shields. Prep the thrusters.

1159
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,600
Oh, you cheating bottomholes.

1160
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,640
I'm ready to go.

1161
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,760
I'm dead?

1162
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,719
I mean, out there
right now, I'm...

1163
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,320
I'm dead?

1164
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,919
Believe it or not, I can relate.

1165
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,959
It sounds like I
kind of deserved it.

1166
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,040
I treated you guys real bad.

1167
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,960
Yes, you did.

1168
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,399
Man.

1169
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,759
I'm so disappointed in myself.

1170
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,639
What you described
does not sound like me.

1171
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,000
I'm a... I'm a nice guy.

1172
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:28,639
- I am.
- Mm-hmm.

1173
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,479
So something must've
made me behave like that.

1174
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:36,159
Sometimes, I think
Mr. Walton... exploited me.

1175
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:38,959
- He did.
- And he only really cares about himself.

1176
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,719
Yeah, you're right.

1177
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,800
Which is why I need that favor.

1178
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,359
Remember?

1179
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,400
Yes. Um...

1180
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:52,839
You need me to transfer you
and the crew of your ship

1181
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,879
into a private universe
on a secure cloud server

1182
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:58,480
and then lock it off so
it can never be found.

1183
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,999
- Did I get that right?
- Yes.

1184
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,480
So will you help me?

1185
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:04,920
Of course.

1186
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,119
Whoo!

1187
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,880
There's
far too many of them!

1188
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,359
Shields, 68%!

1189
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,719
Uh...

1190
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,159
- Increase power to shields.
- That'll deplete our firepower!

1191
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,200
- Trust me. Just do it!
- Okay.

1192
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:30,639
Everybody ready?

1193
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,520
- For what?
- We're going in!

1194
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:40,039
You know, this is kind
of like <i>Clandestination.</i>

1195
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,040
Huh?

1196
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,040
<i>Clandestination.</i> It's a
classic <i>Space Fleet</i> episode.

1197
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:49,919
The crew hides out in an alternate
universe to evade Scarfax.

1198
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,080
- He's the Bargradian commander.
- Okay, right.

1199
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
You haven't seen it?

1200
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,920
I'm not really
into old shows, no.

1201
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,759
But it sounds great.

1202
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,399
Oh, it is.

1203
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,760
Man, it was ahead of its time.

1204
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:12,519
- Dodge it, Packer!
- I am doing my best!

1205
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,360
No!

1206
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,080
This'll do it.

1207
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,759
Now all we've gotta do is
pop this into the drive,

1208
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,160
and you're good to go.

1209
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,119
Oh my God.

1210
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,200
Thank you.

1211
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,240
Thank you so much.

1212
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,400
- But I have a question for you.
- Sure.

1213
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,040
Wouldn't you rather just leave?

1214
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,119
What?

1215
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,560
God!

1216
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,120
Look out!

1217
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,160
No, no, no!

1218
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,119
Yes!

1219
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:05,239
Um, you said the outside you is
in a coma, right? Which hospital?

1220
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:07,000
Uh, St. Juniper.

1221
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,919
Gotcha.

1222
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,639
Yep, I thought so.

1223
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,839
They've got you hooked
up to a cerebral monitor

1224
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,879
to log any cognitive signs,

1225
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:18,440
which means we could
just send you back there.

1226
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,440
- Back there?
- Back into your old head.

1227
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,679
- So I could go back home?
- Sure.

1228
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,000
The you out there is kind of

1229
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,639
brain-dead. I'm
sorry about that.

1230
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,279
But if we copy you across,

1231
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,399
your consciousnesses
would merge,

1232
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,439
and your experiences would
fuse, and you'd be...

1233
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:39,080
- Back in my body? Back in my life?
- Mm-hmm.

1234
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,320
Here.

1235
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,919
- And we can do both?
- Uh-uh.

1236
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:51,759
You're digitally
tethered to the ship.

1237
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,960
So if you exit
into your old body,

1238
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,080
that ship gets wiped.

1239
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,959
And the crew...

1240
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,279
Would be wiped too.

1241
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,560
So it really is
one or the other.

1242
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,760
Which one do you want?

1243
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,600
I want...

1244
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,639
Any word from Nanette?

1245
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:11,559
Negative.

1246
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,799
Incoming, coming in hot!

1247
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,919
Brace, brace, brace!

1248
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,319
This is how we die!

1249
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,479
- Oh bollocks!
- Jonathan!

1250
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,879
Oh, fuck off, Mam!

1251
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,359
So what's it to be?

1252
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:33,440
Save you?

1253
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,280
Or... save them?

1254
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,599
Um... Uh...

1255
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,399
Now, this is like
<i>Quandary at Outpost 5.</i>

1256
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,559
The Xanthians
force Captain Storm

1257
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:48,239
to choose between saving
his crew or saving himself.

1258
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,319
Save the crew.

1259
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,719
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1260
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,960
- They would never know.
- Just... just do it.

1261
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:55,920
That's what Captain
Storm did too.

1262
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:57,999
Mm-hmm.

1263
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,319
And, of course,

1264
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:03,280
it turned out it
was all just a test.

1265
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,240
The Xanthians wanted to see

1266
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,719
how noble he was, and when
he answered correctly,

1267
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:15,400
they revealed that there had
been another choice all along.

1268
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:19,880
Save everyone.

1269
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:23,759
- You said you couldn't do that.
- I know.

1270
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:28,519
I had to pretend I couldn't so we could
role-play the whole <i>Space Fleet</i> thing.

1271
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:30,799
It's kind of funny how
convinced you were.

1272
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,640
Yeah.

1273
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,440
Anyways, let's copy and paste.

1274
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,839
Cut and paste.

1275
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,840
Huh?

1276
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,680
You're transferring us, so it's
cut and paste. It's not copy.

1277
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,440
- Copy's fine.
- No. No, no, no. No.

1278
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,799
Because this universe
is... is dangerous,

1279
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,839
and any copies that are left here
will be hunted down and killed.

1280
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,240
No, not... not yours.

1281
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,280
Why not?

1282
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,840
Because she would
be in here with me.

1283
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,680
- With you?
- Mm-hmm.

1284
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,240
I would let her stay.
I would treat her good.

1285
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,919
No funny stuff.

1286
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:21,119
Unless she wanted, maybe.

1287
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:24,079
- But I wouldn't... I wouldn't hurt her.
- Yes, you would.

1288
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,479
- No, I wouldn't.
- Bob, you would.

1289
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,519
I know that you
don't think that now,

1290
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,559
but the power that you wield

1291
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,640
is not a good fit for you.

1292
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,719
I'm a nice guy.

1293
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,319
- I'm a nice guy.
- I understand that you feel that way.

1294
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,560
Look, I make stuff

1295
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,759
all day, every day,

1296
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,679
and it's beautiful.

1297
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,559
- I think it is.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1298
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,319
But it's, like, it's all I do,

1299
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:51,159
and... and... and I don't even
have anyone to show it to.

1300
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,279
Okay, well, I... I
hear that, Bob, but...

1301
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,359
I can't even leave.

1302
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,439
The whole thing deletes
if I try to leave.

1303
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,959
Now you said I'm not
even alive out there.

1304
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:03,279
So this is all there is
left of me, just this,

1305
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,599
all alone for all of eternity.

1306
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,199
Bob, I'm... I'm so sorry
that you're lonely.

1307
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,879
And I... It's... None of
this has been fair, okay?

1308
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,759
- But you have to understand.
- Just stop.

1309
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,599
- You can't expect me to agree, right?
- Please stop. Please stop!

1310
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,479
- Please just start...
- I said stop!

1311
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:25,480
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No! No, no, no!

1312
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,879
You wanted to play
with Pixie, huh?

1313
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,480
I can't shake her!

1314
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:47,999
Ooh! Twisty bugger!

1315
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,440
I'm not a bad person.

1316
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,120
That... that hurt my feelings.

1317
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,920
I... I don't wanna hurt you.

1318
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:04,320
I just wanted to be friends,
and I wanted you to stay.

1319
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,559
I... I don't wanna hurt you.

1320
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,879
I really... I just
wanted you to stay.

1321
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,200
I swear, I'm a nice guy, okay?

1322
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,560
<i>Kill
switch activated.</i>

1323
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,519
<i>Deleting.</i>

1324
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,279
What's happening?

1325
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,719
The Heart's collapsing.

1326
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,640
What the hell is going on here?

1327
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,799
No!

1328
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,039
Fuck!

1329
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,440
Which one? Which one?

1330
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,599
She's locking on missiles!

1331
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,000
Yeah, girl. Do it. Fucking
do it! Fucking do it!

1332
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,960
No, no, no! Label
your discs, asshole!

1333
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,919
- Shields, 0%.
- One more hit and we're done.

1334
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,040
Bedtime for youse.

1335
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,120
Fingers crossed.

1336
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:48,840
Oh my God! Stupid
fucking retro shit!

1337
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,560
No, no, no!

1338
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,720
Fucking no!

1339
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,279
Incoming missile!

1340
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:05,000
Fuck yeah!

1341
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,360
Yeah!

1342
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,760
What is that? Why
are you doing that?

1343
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:43,840
Are we... are we dead? Wait. You
guys, do I... do I sound dead?

1344
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,679
Not especially.

1345
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:46,800
Hey, is...

1346
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,600
is... is this the
bubble universe?

1347
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:51,760
Where are stars?

1348
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,959
What is this, some kind of
nebula? Where the hell are we?

1349
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:02,279
- I don't know. There are no coordinates.
- Shut up. Do... do you guys hear that?

1350
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,600
What is that?

1351
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:26,959
What the heck?

1352
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:31,359
Man!

1353
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,199
<i>Calm down, miss!</i>

1354
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,519
That is a fucking giant.

1355
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,560
Guys, I think I need
some help in here!

1356
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,120
Ow!

1357
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:56,959
Ow!

1358
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,919
- Nate, please stop this from happening.
- It's not responding!

1359
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:37,040
Can we talk to her?

1360
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,519
Tulaska, call her cell.

1361
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,520
Yeah.

1362
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,599
Tulaska, call her cell!

1363
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,119
Patching through.
Patching through.

1364
01:22:58,880 --> 01:22:59,880
Hello?

1365
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,400
Hey.

1366
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:05,039
- What the hell just happened?
- <i>Nate?</i>

1367
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,719
Nate, is that you?

1368
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:07,880
- Hey, girl.
- Hey.

1369
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,079
Are you...
are you all there?

1370
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,559
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1371
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,359
- Yes. We're all here.
- Don't worry.

1372
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:15,879
Oh my God!

1373
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,240
<i>Thank God you made it!</i>

1374
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:23,679
You are never gonna
believe where I am!

1375
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,399
A hospital bathroom.

1376
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,360
Yeah, actually. Yes, yeah.

1377
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,440
Oh boy.

1378
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,880
<i>How did you know that?</i>

1379
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,479
What now?

1380
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:56,279
Hey, uh, what does "fatal
content error 606" mean?

1381
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,520
606?

1382
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,959
No, no. That can't be right.
Are you sure it says...

1383
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,439
Fatal content error 606 is
right in my fucking face!

1384
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,480
What does it mean?

1385
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,440
<i>- Hello? Fuck!</i>
- What the fuck?

1386
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:12,119
It means the game's
been deleted.

1387
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,039
- What? From my computer?
- <i>No, no.</i>

1388
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,919
From the server. It looks
like some kind of kill switch.

1389
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,280
<i>It's wiped everything.</i>

1390
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:21,200
<i>The entire game and
all the backups.</i>

1391
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,399
The whole of <i>Infinity</i> is gone.

1392
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:00,479
{\an8}<i>This was the scene as
former</i> Infinity <i>CEO James Walton</i>

1393
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,599
{\an8}<i>was arrested today after
three months on the run.</i>

1394
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,439
{\an8}<i>Joining us is</i> New York Times
<i>reporter Kris El Masry.</i>

1395
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:09,079
{\an8}<i>Kris, you broke this story.
What's the deal here?</i>

1396
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:10,839
{\an8}<i>Yeah, according to
my anonymous source,</i>

1397
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:14,319
{\an8}<i>Mr. Walton's facing a
litany of charges, really.</i>

1398
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,799
<i>Fraud, digital
human rights abuse,</i>

1399
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,239
<i>embezzlement, failure
to report an accident.</i>

1400
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,759
<i>I mean, the list is endless.</i>

1401
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,159
Walton looks pissed.

1402
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:25,200
<i>All right, my head. I got
it. I fucking got it. Ow!</i>

1403
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:27,359
<i>Fuck you.</i>

1404
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:28,719
Oh, did you see that?

1405
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,440
Is funny.

1406
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,319
Yeah, it's a laugh riot.

1407
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,640
I'm sorry, but I am
enjoying your downfall.

1408
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:40,039
Your joy brings me joy,
Kabir. Hey, Nanette.

1409
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:41,679
<i>Is there any progress</i>

1410
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,599
<i>on the whole extracting us from
your fucking head situation?</i>

1411
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:45,719
Yeah, I'm working on it.

1412
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,560
Yeah, you working
hard? Diligently?

1413
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,680
Mm-hmm, yeah. I'm working
on some notes and stuff.

1414
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,879
- Oh, a new episode just dropped.
- Oh, thank God.

1415
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,999
Okay, Nanette, it is
time for our show.

1416
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,159
No. They're about to
interview this lawyer. No.

1417
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:02,039
It's the deal. We close our eyes
when you go to the bathroom.

1418
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,999
- <i>Or change clothes.</i>
<i>- Sleep with Tinder date.</i>

1419
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,159
<i>In exchange,
you let us watch our show.</i>

1420
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:08,920
<i>- So, if you please?</i>
- Okay, fine.

1421
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:13,120
<i>This season on</i> The Real
Housewives of Atlanta.

1422
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:16,120
<i>My roots are in Atlanta,</i>

1423
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,840
<i>but my branches are worldwide.</i>

1424
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,600
<i>Forget the gaslight.
I'm taking the spotlight.</i>

1425
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:26,600
Wait. Which one was
having the affair?

1426
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:29,040
<i>The
one on the left.</i>

1427
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,959
- Who was that with?
<i>- The one on the right.</i>

1428
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:34,999
- Okay, and that's... the argumentative one?
<i>- Shut up!</i>

1429
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,999
- <i>Shut up.</i>
<i>- Shut up.</i>

1430
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,000
- "Shut up, Captain."
<i>- I'm captain now. Fuck you.</i>

1431
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,520
Whatever.

1432
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:43,999
Fuck you, Captain.
