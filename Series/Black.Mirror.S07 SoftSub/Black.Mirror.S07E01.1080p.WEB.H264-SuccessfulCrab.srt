1
00:00:43,588 --> 00:00:45,022
My god!

2
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:47,522
Wow, look at us.

3
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:48,939
We were so happy then.

4
00:00:48,963 --> 00:00:50,838
What happened to us?

5
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:53,231
I blame you.

6
00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:54,731
I think it's your fault.

7
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,338
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,772
Happy anniversary.

9
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:03,772
- Save it for tonight.
- What?!

10
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:05,731
- Yeah.
- I'll make some coffee.

11
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:06,880
Okay, that's great.

12
00:01:07,463 --> 00:01:10,713
You can stay here and
look at more pictures of me.

13
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:15,606
Does anyone know how
autonomous drone insects

14
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,981
help with flowers?

15
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:18,588
Anyone? Tisha.

16
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:20,606
Polarization.

17
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,231
Almost. Very close.

18
00:01:22,255 --> 00:01:23,439
Pollination.

19
00:01:23,463 --> 00:01:26,397
So the adis buzz from flower to flower

20
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:27,897
and spread pollen,

21
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,588
which is the same way
organic bees used to do.

22
00:01:31,088 --> 00:01:33,314
And the technology
around this is amazing.

23
00:01:33,338 --> 00:01:35,397
That's it.

24
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:36,755
Class is over.

25
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:38,963
Happy weekend, everybody.

26
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:42,647
- Bye.
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye, see ya.

27
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:45,588
Hey, Eva.

28
00:01:47,088 --> 00:01:48,522
Everything okay? What's up?

29
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:50,106
It's tisha again.

30
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,022
She laughed at my shoes.

31
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:54,106
We can't afford new ones.

32
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,380
These were my sister's.

33
00:01:55,963 --> 00:01:58,231
Tisha says they're old.

34
00:01:58,255 --> 00:02:02,772
They're not old. They're vintage,
which means they tell their own story.

35
00:02:02,796 --> 00:02:04,338
And that is cool.

36
00:02:05,088 --> 00:02:06,546
Okay, I guess so.

37
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:09,731
All right. Have a great weekend.

38
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,772
- Bye.
- Bye. Who has the coolest shoes?

39
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:13,814
I guess me.

40
00:02:13,838 --> 00:02:16,106
- Hey, cool shoes.
- Thanks.

41
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,689
Amanda, are you coming for a drink?

42
00:02:20,088 --> 00:02:23,106
- Yes, you are, is the answer, but…
- well, the problem is I can't.

43
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,981
Come on, I could use the moral support.

44
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:27,064
I would love to come. Really, I can't.

45
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:28,088
Why not?

46
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:32,022
That's why not. Our anniversary.
He's taking me away for the weekend.

47
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:34,439
- Guten tag, ladies.
- They're back.

48
00:02:34,463 --> 00:02:36,522
They were at the back
of your sock drawer.

49
00:02:36,546 --> 00:02:40,606
I really tried my best to never
see them again, but here we are.

50
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,856
It's tradition, isn't it?

51
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,439
Got the suede shorts, but I didn't think
I should wear them around the school.

52
00:02:45,463 --> 00:02:47,564
Are you taking her somewhere nice?

53
00:02:47,588 --> 00:02:49,439
God, no. No, same old shithole.

54
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:52,439
- Where we got married.
- All right, have a good time, you guys.

55
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,856
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

56
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,963
Be safe out there.

57
00:02:57,755 --> 00:02:59,755
I'm so excited. Happy anniversary.

58
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:02,814
The minute your brain
tries to think about it,

59
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:04,338
it can't think about it.

60
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:17,939
Still the same sign as ever.

61
00:03:17,963 --> 00:03:20,522
You think Phyllis is still
working the desk? I hope so.

62
00:03:20,546 --> 00:03:22,356
I hope she's not, actually.

63
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:32,522
Do you remember when Janice
got up and started singing?

64
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,106
Your maid of honor?
Yes. Would she remember?

65
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,546
Do you think she was drunk?

66
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,314
- My god.
- And one Juniper brat burger.

67
00:03:40,338 --> 00:03:42,731
- Jeez Louise.
- One more Juniper brat burger.

68
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:43,772
Thank you, Polly.

69
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:45,731
- Wow.
- Yeah, sure. Knock yourselves out.

70
00:03:45,755 --> 00:03:48,481
- Thank you. Thank you?
- It hasn't changed.

71
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:51,963
They have really outdone themselves.

72
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:53,481
- Ooh!
- Look at that.

73
00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:54,647
- Ready?
- Yeah.

74
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:56,772
Three, two, one.

75
00:04:01,963 --> 00:04:03,522
That's dense.

76
00:04:03,546 --> 00:04:05,689
I like when my food fights back.

77
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:10,647
Wow. He's sweet.

78
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:12,213
I hope they're an item.

79
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,296
He's more committed than ever before.

80
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:29,421
Look.

81
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,463
The old piece of gum is still here.

82
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,755
Hello, our little friend.

83
00:04:36,338 --> 00:04:38,272
Who stuck you up there?

84
00:04:38,296 --> 00:04:39,731
We all know how you feel.

85
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,630
What's with the sex yoga?

86
00:04:43,338 --> 00:04:46,755
Apparently, this helps your
little swimmers find their target.

87
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:51,338
Are you sure you wanna try again?

88
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:55,005
This isn't an official try.

89
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,546
But I'm okay with a happy accident.

90
00:04:58,046 --> 00:04:59,022
Okay.

91
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:02,838
Although, arguably, I'm doing a
lot of encouraging right now, so

92
00:05:03,463 --> 00:05:04,713
I'll encourage you.

93
00:05:07,963 --> 00:05:10,755
- You okay?
- Another headache.

94
00:05:11,505 --> 00:05:14,546
Another fucking
headache. You poor thing.

95
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:17,255
Lucky for you, it's post-coitus.

96
00:05:18,338 --> 00:05:20,689
Coitus. Nice.

97
00:05:20,713 --> 00:05:22,522
- Can you grab my…
- yeah, I got you.

98
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:24,356
- Medic… thank you.
- Here you go.

99
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,064
Ooh.

100
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:29,005
That's… wow.

101
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:34,106
Made you some coffee, babe.

102
00:05:35,796 --> 00:05:36,796
Babes?

103
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:40,296
Babe?

104
00:05:41,796 --> 00:05:43,630
Hey. You okay?

105
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:46,421
I got my period.

106
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:51,713
Hey, we'll get 'em next time, okay?

107
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,606
- We bought this too soon.
- No, don't do that.

108
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,272
Yeah. I mean, you know
I can't resist a bargain,

109
00:05:58,296 --> 00:05:59,880
but maybe it was bad luck.

110
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:02,005
Come on, Amanda.

111
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,005
Maybe it still is.

112
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:06,981
Let's put it on eBay and
just get a couple bucks.

113
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:08,046
Shut up.

114
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,421
We're gonna need it soon.

115
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:15,380
After last time, we
don't even… know if I can.

116
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:17,671
You can.

117
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
And you will.

118
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:24,397
Or my dick will die trying.

119
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:28,564
- I'm late. I love you.
- Love you.

120
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:38,588
Mike!

121
00:06:40,338 --> 00:06:41,338
Mike!

122
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,671
- What?
- Come here.

123
00:06:49,796 --> 00:06:51,880
- What's up?
- We need Shane on the rig.

124
00:06:52,505 --> 00:06:55,296
- Where is he?
- Taking too long on his break again.

125
00:06:59,296 --> 00:07:01,522
All right, you weirdos.

126
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,546
Shane!

127
00:07:02,963 --> 00:07:03,963
Don't be resting.

128
00:07:05,255 --> 00:07:07,272
- Nothing.
- Wait one moment.

129
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:09,147
Come on. You're taking
the piss. Get out there.

130
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:11,772
I just threw some coin at
this loser on dum dummies.

131
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:12,897
- On what?
- Dum dummies.

132
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:15,314
- You don't know about dum dummies?
- No, come on.

133
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:16,564
It's so fucking funny.

134
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:18,314
Desperate people go on here,

135
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:21,772
and then the audience pays
them to do some dark shit.

136
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:23,689
- When we reach 20 bucks...
- I don't, I

137
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:26,231
this guy is gonna drink
his own piss. Look at him.

138
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:27,897
Look, look. Target reached.

139
00:07:30,046 --> 00:07:32,272
- Fucking sick.
- He's drinking piss.

140
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:33,606
Jesus Christ.

141
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,314
- I'm supporting the gig economy.
- Don't do it on the work computer.

142
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:40,588
You're so good at your job, I just
wanna see you do it, you know?

143
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,022
Fuck you guys.

144
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:46,522
Fucking Americans.

145
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:51,397
Then the sun's rays travel
millions and millions of miles,

146
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:53,689
all from space,

147
00:07:53,713 --> 00:07:56,064
and come down and hit the solar panels.

148
00:07:56,088 --> 00:07:59,171
And then, once they hit the solar panels,

149
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:01,588
they, travel

150
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,380
far

151
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:06,505
travel… long.

152
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:13,856
Mike! Mike!

153
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,963
Hey, Mike!

154
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:17,255
Mike!

155
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:20,689
- What?
- Hospital's trying to call you.

156
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:22,772
- What?
- Something about Amanda.

157
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,088
- Did they say what it was?
- I don't know, but it sounded serious.

158
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:39,481
There is no simple solution

159
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:42,731
due to where it's located and
how long it's been growing.

160
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,130
It's essentially fused
to her parietal lobe.

161
00:08:49,546 --> 00:08:51,421
- Mr. Waters?
- Yeah.

162
00:08:53,588 --> 00:08:56,356
- As I was saying, there's no...
- is she gonna be okay?

163
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,755
I'm sorry. Her prognosis isn't good.

164
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:02,463
How

165
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:07,588
sorry, what are you
saying to me right now?

166
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:10,671
She may never regain consciousness.

167
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:18,755
No.

168
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,088
No. I mean, come on, look at her.

169
00:09:21,588 --> 00:09:24,981
She's breathing in there. There
must be something you can do.

170
00:09:25,005 --> 00:09:27,606
Even just a few months
ago, I'd have said no,

171
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,939
but now there may be an option.

172
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:31,772
It's… it's a new start-up.

173
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:34,106
They have an experimental procedure.

174
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,796
- It's very new, so not without risk.
- Okay.

175
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:39,380
Their rep was in here just last week.

176
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:44,272
I can't make a personal recommendation,
but you want me to call her?

177
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:45,755
Yeah, I want you to call her.

178
00:09:57,963 --> 00:09:58,963
Hi.

179
00:10:00,255 --> 00:10:01,397
You must be Mike.

180
00:10:03,546 --> 00:10:05,963
I'm gay nor from river mind.

181
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:09,213
Come with me.

182
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:13,796
Rivermind is a revolution
in neurological science.

183
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:17,981
How it works is both
high-tech and incredibly simple.

184
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:22,147
So we take an imprint of the
affected part of her neural structure,

185
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:24,755
and we clone it onto our mainframe.

186
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,713
So basically, we just…
we make a backup

187
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:31,439
of part of her brain onto our computer.

188
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:35,231
And then we remove the tumor
and the surrounding tissue and

189
00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:37,314
wait, wait, wait. Isn't that dangerous?

190
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:38,481
Well, normally, yeah.

191
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,755
But we made a backup, remember?

192
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:47,439
And then we replace what we
removed with synthetic receiver tissue.

193
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:51,314
And then the river mind system
transmits cognitive function

194
00:10:51,338 --> 00:10:54,314
from the backup on
the cloud-based server.

195
00:10:54,338 --> 00:10:56,897
- Allowing her to live her life.
- Okay, has anyb

196
00:10:56,921 --> 00:11:00,147
does this work, honestly?
Has this been tested even?

197
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:01,272
Yes, it has.

198
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:03,130
I am living proof.

199
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,796
Wait. What are you talking about?

200
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,481
Do you want me to show you?
Okay, you see me right now, right?

201
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:10,564
- I do.
- Okay.

202
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,838
Eighteen months ago, this was me.

203
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:15,838
- Shit.
- I had a terrible accident.

204
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:19,522
I got a knock to the head
that technically killed me.

205
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:22,897
So I was… I was lucky to be
one of the first river minders.

206
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:25,522
- Otherwise, I would not be here...
- are you

207
00:11:25,546 --> 00:11:29,022
I'm sorry. I don't... i… I don't
know how else to say this.

208
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:31,356
- No, go ahead. Bring it on.
- Are you

209
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,796
tell me. Normal?

210
00:11:33,755 --> 00:11:34,856
- Yes.
- Yes.

211
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,213
Physically, mentally, I.

212
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,189
I am fine.

213
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:44,939
And my kids say that I am still
the same pain in the ass that I was.

214
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,213
It's really sweet.

215
00:11:49,421 --> 00:11:51,005
- Do you have children?
- Not yet.

216
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,189
Been close a couple of times.

217
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:56,213
Mike.

218
00:11:57,838 --> 00:11:59,397
This will give you time.

219
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:02,647
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

220
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:03,647
It will.

221
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:05,481
Yeah.

222
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:07,606
So a couple things you need to know.

223
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,356
She's gonna sleep more every night.

224
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,606
One or two more hours.

225
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,564
It's one of the ways that we
help the demand on our servers.

226
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:17,772
And then she has to physically
stay within the coverage range.

227
00:12:17,796 --> 00:12:21,147
It's kind of like cell service. We're
new, but let me just show you.

228
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:24,981
So we already have
most of the state covered,

229
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:26,439
and in the next year or so,

230
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:30,505
we're gonna roll out
nationwide and worldwide.

231
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:34,505
How much is this gonna cost?

232
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,713
It's less than you think.

233
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,356
Is it less than we have?

234
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,064
Because it's pretty tight.

235
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:43,255
Honestly, it's less than you think.

236
00:12:43,755 --> 00:12:48,189
We're really trying to drive uptake,
so our pricing is really reasonable.

237
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,213
And

238
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:53,046
the surgery is free.

239
00:12:55,213 --> 00:12:56,106
Wow, okay.

240
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,231
- Yes.
- Okay.

241
00:12:57,255 --> 00:12:59,981
And then for the streaming,
we run a subscription model.

242
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:01,064
So it's 300.

243
00:13:01,088 --> 00:13:02,630
It's 300 a month.

244
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:07,338
Okay.

245
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:19,421
Mr. Waters?

246
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,981
She did great. You can see her now.

247
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:31,671
Hey.

248
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:34,481
- Hi.
- Hey, babe.

249
00:13:34,505 --> 00:13:36,522
Hi.

250
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:37,856
Is it really you?

251
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:42,880
Aw, I'm so happy to see you.

252
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,296
Ditto.

253
00:13:46,505 --> 00:13:50,064
They said I was gone for a couple days.

254
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:51,755
Yeah, you were.

255
00:13:53,088 --> 00:13:54,171
I came back.

256
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:57,755
- So you did.
- Thanks to you.

257
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,814
The doctor said I could
go home next week.

258
00:14:01,838 --> 00:14:04,213
Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna get you home.

259
00:14:05,338 --> 00:14:06,338
Missed you.

260
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,088
That nurse said I was a miracle.

261
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:16,088
You are a fucking miracle.

262
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:19,255
I am a fucking miracle.

263
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:32,231
Holy shit! I mean,

264
00:14:32,255 --> 00:14:37,005
I'm, like, really happy I'm
alive, but 300 bucks a month?

265
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:40,231
Mike, it's a lot of money every month.

266
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,397
Yeah, I know. I know.

267
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:44,689
But I'm taking extra shifts, and
there's stuff that we can cut back on.

268
00:14:44,713 --> 00:14:48,546
Like… maybe we don't
need that trip to galway.

269
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,356
To see your dad? No.

270
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,522
It says river mind won't roll out
in Ireland for a couple of years,

271
00:14:54,546 --> 00:14:58,731
and dad's a bit of a cunt now anyway,
so that's a cutback I can live with.

272
00:14:58,755 --> 00:15:00,588
Come on!

273
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:06,064
You know you're going,
like, five miles per hour, right?

274
00:15:06,088 --> 00:15:08,814
You just had surgery on
your brain. I'm being cautious.

275
00:15:08,838 --> 00:15:12,421
Yeah, well, there's cautious,
and then there's, like, this.

276
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:14,796
You're so pretty when you're alive.

277
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,647
Okay, guys, let's take
a look at our little friend,

278
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:52,106
our little amphibian.

279
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,213
Don't put your fingers in there
'cause he might think it's food.

280
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:43,630
- Hey.
- Hey.

281
00:16:49,463 --> 00:16:52,838
Go easy on those. Can't
afford more until payday.

282
00:17:08,463 --> 00:17:10,272
- Go grab me another one.
- Sure.

283
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,255
Guy's pulling out his own tooth.

284
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:18,171
Yeah!

285
00:17:19,046 --> 00:17:20,397
Look, he swallowed it!

286
00:17:21,796 --> 00:17:22,796
Shit.

287
00:17:47,796 --> 00:17:48,796
Babe.

288
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,213
Sorry I'm late.

289
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:56,296
Shane knocked over a scaffold.

290
00:17:58,921 --> 00:17:59,921
Amanda?

291
00:18:13,755 --> 00:18:14,755
Shit.

292
00:18:15,713 --> 00:18:17,505
It's June 5th this Saturday.

293
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:20,046
Okay, and?

294
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:24,005
And?

295
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,921
Ju… June 5th.

296
00:18:29,171 --> 00:18:30,546
Our anniversary?

297
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:33,189
- Shit.
- God.

298
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:36,046
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:38,755
I didn't plan anything.

300
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:40,856
I did though.

301
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,963
We're going to the Juniper.

302
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:45,939
Okay.

303
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:47,671
A fun little splurge.

304
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:02,255
You okay, hon?

305
00:19:02,921 --> 00:19:04,796
- I can drive.
- I'm fine, Amanda.

306
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:07,647
Just a really long day today.

307
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:10,106
Yeah. You're doing too many shifts.

308
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:14,439
Yeah, well, we need the money.
It's not like you can get a second job.

309
00:19:14,463 --> 00:19:15,963
You need to sleep.

310
00:19:16,463 --> 00:19:18,481
Yeah, that's not really my fault.

311
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:19,814
I know. I know.

312
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:22,481
I'm not... that wasn't...
that's not what I was saying.

313
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:25,272
You know, we could
just not go to the Juniper

314
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:27,213
and save some money, you know?

315
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,064
We promised we'd always
go on our anniversary, babe.

316
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,564
I know, I just… I'm saying
we could celebrate at home.

317
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:38,272
I need a break, Amanda.
I work my fucking arse off.

318
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:41,356
- We both do. It's not just you.
- I'm not saying you don't. I'm not s.

319
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:44,189
- I didn't...
- but I sleep all the time.

320
00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:46,981
- And I'm just a teacher.
- "Just a teacher."

321
00:19:47,005 --> 00:19:49,064
- Not manual labor.
- I see where we're going.

322
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,772
- But that...
- you work hard, Amanda.

323
00:19:50,796 --> 00:19:53,314
- I'm not fucking disputing that.
- I'm not making money

324
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:55,897
we both work hard!
Nobody is disputing that!

325
00:19:55,921 --> 00:20:00,356
I'm just saying, don't you wanna
have fun in our free time, you know?

326
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:03,356
Babe? Shit.

327
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:10,630
Babe, babe, babe?
Sweetheart, can you hear me?

328
00:20:11,255 --> 00:20:14,130
Okay, babe? Babe. We're gonna
get you to the hospital, okay?

329
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,005
All right, wait, wait.

330
00:20:19,463 --> 00:20:20,463
Shit.

331
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:23,463
Fuck, fuck!

332
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:26,463
Shit.

333
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,439
What happened? What happened?

334
00:20:28,463 --> 00:20:30,564
- Why are you driving so fast? Don't…
- I'm not.

335
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:31,588
Slow down.

336
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,147
What's wrong?

337
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:35,814
My god.

338
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:37,522
God.

339
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:38,647
I understand.

340
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,981
Wow, that must have been
so frightening, you guys.

341
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:42,005
Yeah.

342
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:48,106
The good news is there's
no malfunction, Amanda.

343
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,421
- There… wh…
- what?

344
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,189
Did you not just… she blacked out.

345
00:20:52,213 --> 00:20:54,022
- Yeah, it was…
- I thought she was dead.

346
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:58,171
It's because you passed
outside the coverage area.

347
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:01,647
- But you said that you checked the map.
- I did check the m

348
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:04,356
- I looked. It said it was within range.
- You were gonna

349
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,963
what happened was we are
upgrading some of our towers,

350
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:15,481
and the ones in Palmer county
are on the new bandwidth,

351
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:20,880
which is part of an exciting
change to river mind's service.

352
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,772
What do you mean, change?

353
00:21:22,796 --> 00:21:23,963
From Monday,

354
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:29,630
we are introducing river mind plus.

355
00:21:30,296 --> 00:21:31,189
Plus?

356
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:36,439
A new subscription tier that
has extended coverage, okay?

357
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:39,897
So it makes great use
of those upgraded towers.

358
00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:42,272
- I'm gonna show you. Stand by.
- That could be good.

359
00:21:42,296 --> 00:21:44,606
- Yeah. We have this…
- here we go. All right, look at this.

360
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,564
This is it.

361
00:21:45,588 --> 00:21:49,755
As you can see, we will be extending
our coverage all over North America.

362
00:21:50,338 --> 00:21:52,022
- So we can travel.
- Yeah.

363
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:55,189
Yes, if you upgrade, then
absolutely you can travel.

364
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,856
And if we don't?

365
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,772
Then you just stay within
your existing coverage range.

366
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:04,731
So you're saying that we
have to upgrade to plus

367
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:07,356
if we wanna leave the county?

368
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,380
Right, yeah.

369
00:22:08,755 --> 00:22:11,772
When we signed up, you said it
was just gonna roll out everywhere.

370
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:16,189
Yes, it is, with river mind plus.
That's what this is. This is the roll out.

371
00:22:16,213 --> 00:22:17,897
How much is the…
how much is the plus?

372
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:20,814
So it is $500 a month

373
00:22:20,838 --> 00:22:23,356
on top of the existing package.

374
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,522
So $800 in total.

375
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:28,022
- 800 bucks a month?
- Yeah.

376
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,314
We can't afford that.
That's not... we can't

377
00:22:30,338 --> 00:22:32,022
you don't have to worry about that.

378
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:36,772
I mean, if you choose not to upgrade,
you'll just stay on river mind common.

379
00:22:36,796 --> 00:22:37,689
"Common"?

380
00:22:37,713 --> 00:22:41,564
And you will continue to
enjoy experiencing the services

381
00:22:41,588 --> 00:22:44,755
that you already have
at the current price point.

382
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,939
You okay? It's nearly eight
o'clock. Won't you be late?

383
00:22:52,963 --> 00:22:56,046
Yeah. I swear I'm sleeping more,

384
00:22:57,046 --> 00:23:01,505
which was a life goal, but
this isn't like normal sleep.

385
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,671
There's like a… …electronic
whistling in my head.

386
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:10,713
- You want a coffee?
- Yes, please. God, yes, thank you.

387
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,064
Have you tried Espresso grande?

388
00:23:16,088 --> 00:23:20,397
The beans are roasted slow and
long for a richer, smoother taste.

389
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:22,088
Can't say that I have.

390
00:23:23,296 --> 00:23:26,588
- Can't say that you have what?
- Tried Espresso grande.

391
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,897
Is that what this is?

392
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:31,356
What? No. That's just our usual shit.

393
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:36,439
- So why did you bring up Espresso grande?
- I didn't.

394
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:40,546
- Wait, what?
- Sh... fucking Shane.

395
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,421
Fucking Shane today.

396
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:45,796
See you later.

397
00:23:52,463 --> 00:23:53,939
So, at the hive,

398
00:23:53,963 --> 00:23:57,606
the bees pass the nectar
between themselves until it's gooey,

399
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,564
and then they push it into the
wax chamber until it becomes

400
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:04,147
anyone? Bobby.

401
00:24:04,171 --> 00:24:05,439
It becomes honey.

402
00:24:05,463 --> 00:24:07,171
That's right. Honey.

403
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:10,522
Kids love honey.

404
00:24:10,546 --> 00:24:12,897
That's why parents love honey nugs.

405
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:16,505
Whole grain chunks covered
in golden tupelo honey,

406
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:18,921
the sweetest way to start your day.

407
00:24:19,421 --> 00:24:20,838
Honey nugs from ditta.

408
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,755
And can anyone tell me
something with honey in it?

409
00:24:26,838 --> 00:24:27,897
Mickey.

410
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:28,856
Honey nugs.

411
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,897
Honey what?

412
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:31,022
Honey nugs.

413
00:24:31,046 --> 00:24:33,064
What are… what are those?

414
00:24:33,088 --> 00:24:35,005
The sweetest way to start your day.

415
00:24:36,713 --> 00:24:38,630
Okay, if you say so.

416
00:24:39,421 --> 00:24:40,772
Anyone else?

417
00:24:40,796 --> 00:24:42,380
Bye-bye. Bye.

418
00:24:44,546 --> 00:24:46,421
Bye, sweetie. See you tomorrow.

419
00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:49,772
Hey, Oscar, what's up?
You're kind of quiet today.

420
00:24:49,796 --> 00:24:50,689
You okay?

421
00:24:50,713 --> 00:24:55,088
Well, mom says we have to
move out to get away from dad.

422
00:24:56,588 --> 00:24:57,755
Well,

423
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:01,856
you know, your mom must
have a very good reason

424
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,147
to even think about
saying something like that.

425
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:06,588
Yeah, dad gets mad all the time.

426
00:25:07,921 --> 00:25:09,606
That must be really scary.

427
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,564
Yeah, but he says it's mom's fault.

428
00:25:12,588 --> 00:25:14,147
I don't wanna go.

429
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:16,546
I hear you, Oscar.

430
00:25:17,588 --> 00:25:18,588
Listen,

431
00:25:19,005 --> 00:25:22,064
sometimes we have to do
things that we don't wanna do,

432
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:24,921
but they turn out for the best.

433
00:25:26,463 --> 00:25:27,755
And the truth is,

434
00:25:28,255 --> 00:25:32,046
families that stay together
bask in the glow of Christ's heart.

435
00:25:32,838 --> 00:25:35,897

Okay.

439
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,421
Have a good day.

440
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:53,671
Long day?

441
00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:55,588
Yeah.

442
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,838
Too long for a happy accident?

443
00:26:01,755 --> 00:26:03,296
Fuck no.

444
00:26:07,505 --> 00:26:08,838
Yeah..

445
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:22,731
Ride smooth with thirst trap lube.

none of them vanilla.

447
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,272
What did you say?

448
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,296
What?

449
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,171
- What did you just say?
- I didn't say anything.

450
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:39,231
No, I mean when you
were just talking about lube.

451
00:26:39,255 --> 00:26:40,796
I don't need lube.

452
00:26:43,505 --> 00:26:44,856
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

453
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,897
Why did you just say, "ride
smooth with thirst trap lube"?

454
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,397
What? I didn't… I didn't say that.

455
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:53,689
Yeah, you did. Yeah, you did, just now.

456
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:56,796
I know the kind of sex stuff
that I say. I would never say that.

457
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,671
No, no. Sorry.

458
00:27:03,713 --> 00:27:05,171
Fuck of a buzzkill, that.

459
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:12,189
Hoping for a hard time?

460
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,106
Try manville erectile dysfunction gel.

461
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,921
Side effects may include high
blood pressure and suicidal ideation.

462
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:22,963
What?

463
00:27:23,296 --> 00:27:26,255
Yeah, that's a commercial message.

464
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:29,314
Jesus Christ.

465
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:31,439
As in an advertisement?

466
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:35,939
It's something that we are trialing as
a part of the evolution of our service.

467
00:27:35,963 --> 00:27:39,189
You must be in one of our test
cells. Let me just check and see.

468
00:27:39,213 --> 00:27:43,231
So you're running ads through me?

469
00:27:43,255 --> 00:27:47,147
You're, like, giving me, like,
commercial fucking tourette's?

470
00:27:47,171 --> 00:27:49,856
Okay, not all the customers
appreciate the messages.

471
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,856
Ads! Those are ads!

472
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,189
- Yes.
- Not messages, ads!

473
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,731
But they are designed

474
00:27:54,755 --> 00:27:58,647
to be contextually relevant
to the situation that you're in.

475
00:27:58,671 --> 00:28:01,314
So they will stand out
less in a conversation.

476
00:28:01,338 --> 00:28:03,439
- They'll be less intrusive.
- That makes them worse.

477
00:28:03,463 --> 00:28:07,481
What's your next trick? You gonna
make my asshole whistle jingles?

478
00:28:07,505 --> 00:28:10,147
- That's not part of our development.
- Can we opt out?

479
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:12,272
Of course you can.
Yeah, all you need to do

480
00:28:12,296 --> 00:28:14,731
is upgrade to river mind plus.

481
00:28:14,755 --> 00:28:16,272
That is right, Amanda.

482
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:18,380
- Upgrade.
- We can't afford that.

483
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:21,397
You people are sick.

484
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:26,981
Hot, new fall nikes.

485
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,588
Just $200. Now at foot locker.

486
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:34,838
Amanda?

487
00:28:35,421 --> 00:28:36,421
A quick word?

488
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:42,356
Sorry. Wait, she said I said what?

489
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,564
What I just told you.

490
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:48,231
She says that you recommended
Christian family counseling to her son.

491
00:28:48,255 --> 00:28:51,272
And, listen, she's pissed, right?

492
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:52,189
God.

493
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:53,588
Like, I mean,

494
00:28:54,421 --> 00:28:57,772
I said it doesn't sound like
something that you'd say.

495
00:28:57,796 --> 00:29:00,880
I didn't think that was happening
during school hours. Shit.

496
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,147
You didn't think what would happen?

497
00:29:03,171 --> 00:29:04,814
Feeling over the hill?

498
00:29:04,838 --> 00:29:06,921
Don't panic. There's hope for you.

499
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:10,147
Find your mature match at silver swans.

I'm 49.

502
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:19,713
- What?
- And… what the fuck are you talking about?

503
00:29:21,921 --> 00:29:26,880
So she said if I can't stop doing it
that they're gonna have to let me go.

504
00:29:27,546 --> 00:29:30,439
What? I mean, she can't fire you.

505
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:32,272
What choice do they have?

506
00:29:32,296 --> 00:29:33,713
I can't be around kids.

507
00:29:37,963 --> 00:29:38,963
Amanda

508
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:42,606
you know, if you lose your job,

509
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,481
we're gonna struggle to even
cover our common subscription.

510
00:29:45,505 --> 00:29:46,505
I know.

511
00:29:55,005 --> 00:29:56,088
We'll work it out.

512
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,022
We'll do something.

513
00:29:59,546 --> 00:30:00,630
I'll do something.

514
00:31:11,296 --> 00:31:13,838

00:31:18,963 --> 00:31:20,647
Hi, it's gay nor from river mind.

518
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:23,522
- How are you this morning?
- Hello? Yes, yes.

00:31:23,546 --> 00:31:24,772
Yes, thank god.

520
00:31:24,796 --> 00:31:26,439
- You got my payment?
- Yeah.

521
00:31:26,463 --> 00:31:27,939
Can you flick a switch or whatever?

522
00:31:27,963 --> 00:31:31,314
We are processing your
river mind plus upgrade now.

523
00:31:31,338 --> 00:31:34,564
- How long does it take to kick in?
- Should be pretty much instant.

524
00:31:34,588 --> 00:31:35,522
Okay, great.

525
00:31:35,546 --> 00:31:37,689

like to hear about exciting plans

00:31:40,921 --> 00:31:42,671
fuck no. Hey, babe.

528
00:31:44,088 --> 00:31:46,314
- Hey.
- Hey.

529
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:50,314
Okay, so you're, officially
on river mind plus.

530
00:31:50,338 --> 00:31:51,231
- What?
- Yeah.

531
00:31:51,255 --> 00:31:54,064
I had a bit more left over
from my overtime and stuff,

532
00:31:54,088 --> 00:31:56,606
so I just… made an upgrade.

533
00:31:58,213 --> 00:32:00,106
- Yeah, okay.
- No more ads?

534
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,939
No more ads. No more ads.

535
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:06,088
And, hey, now, with the
location restrictions off,

536
00:32:06,588 --> 00:32:07,796
next anniversary,

537
00:32:08,505 --> 00:32:10,272
we can go back to the Juniper.

538
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:11,296
Aw.

539
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,421
- I wish we could afford it.
- I'll make sure we can afford it.

540
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,005
- Okay, thank you.
- Yeah.

541
00:32:21,796 --> 00:32:23,272
- Love you.
- I love you.

542
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:42,147
Hey, Oscar. Listen, I just

543
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:44,505
mom said not to speak to you anymore.

544
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:49,356
Okay, I'm sorry. Can you tell your mom

545
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,647
I'm not supposed to listen to you either.

546
00:32:51,671 --> 00:32:54,380
- Hey, Oscar. Why don't you come with me?
- Yeah.

547
00:32:59,463 --> 00:33:00,522
Okay, guys.

548
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:04,439
We've just got 20 more
bucks to reach our target.

549
00:33:04,463 --> 00:33:07,921
And I will put my nose in this mousetrap.

550
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:12,463
I'm not gonna put it on my dick.

551
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,397
Not doing that either.

552
00:33:15,421 --> 00:33:17,522
Mask stays on.

553
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,630
Fuck.

554
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:32,338
Okay.

555
00:33:33,546 --> 00:33:35,856
How about… how about this, guys?

556
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,272
How about for $90,

557
00:33:37,296 --> 00:33:40,005
I'll put the fucking
mousetrap on my tongue.

558
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:18,005
It's 10:00 A.M.

559
00:34:19,963 --> 00:34:21,814
How long have I been asleep?

560
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:24,296
Like… like, 12 hours.

561
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,963
What?

562
00:34:27,713 --> 00:34:28,713
Jesus.

563
00:34:29,213 --> 00:34:31,255
Thank god it's the holidays.

564
00:34:31,755 --> 00:34:32,755
Thank god.

565
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:36,130
What's wrong with you?

566
00:34:38,463 --> 00:34:39,606
Bit my tongue.

567
00:34:43,005 --> 00:34:44,713
Why am I sleeping longer?

568
00:34:45,671 --> 00:34:48,189
As a part of our last firmware update,

569
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:51,296
we did extend the sleep time a little bit.

570
00:34:51,796 --> 00:34:53,314
To 12 hours a night?

571
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:56,189
Well, everyone can use
a little extra rest, right?

572
00:34:56,213 --> 00:34:58,814
It's not, restful though.

573
00:34:58,838 --> 00:35:00,814
Like, I'm not dreaming.

574
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:02,481
I wake up tired.

575
00:35:02,505 --> 00:35:05,147
It doesn't feel like actual sleep.

576
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:07,213
Well, that's 'cause it's sleep mode.

577
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:10,689
- "Sleep mode"?
- Yeah.

578
00:35:10,713 --> 00:35:12,481
While you're in sleep mode,

579
00:35:12,505 --> 00:35:17,064
our servers are harnessing
your spare processing capabilities

580
00:35:17,088 --> 00:35:19,505
to help with the overall workload.

581
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:23,505
So you're using my brain

582
00:35:24,046 --> 00:35:25,838
to… to power the server?

583
00:35:26,505 --> 00:35:28,106
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

584
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:32,046
It is, except when you're in sleep
mode. You can kind of think of it like

585
00:35:33,338 --> 00:35:34,897
giving back to the grid.

586
00:35:34,921 --> 00:35:36,963
Why do I have to give back to the grid?

587
00:35:37,463 --> 00:35:42,022
Why? I mean, we pay for fucking plus.
It's supposed to be better than common.

588
00:35:42,046 --> 00:35:43,481
It's better than common.

589
00:35:43,505 --> 00:35:45,439
Seriously, if you were still on common,

590
00:35:45,463 --> 00:35:49,272
my god, you would be looking at
sleeping at, like, up to 16 hours a night,

591
00:35:49,296 --> 00:35:50,231
and with ads?

592
00:35:50,255 --> 00:35:52,897
I mean, Amanda, I'd be happy
to drop you back down a tier.

593
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:53,814
No.

594
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:57,671
Or you could move up
to our exciting new tier.

595
00:35:58,213 --> 00:35:59,564
It's actually the reason

596
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:04,897
that we have extended sleep
mode for our non-premium users.

597
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:06,522
We're premium users.

598
00:36:06,546 --> 00:36:10,939
Well, plus is actually now standard.
But it is better than common.

599
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:15,356
And this new tier, it is ultra-premium.

600
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,421
We call it

601
00:36:17,546 --> 00:36:20,421
river mind Lux.

602
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,296
If you could just turn your
attention to the monitor.

603
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,231
Take a look here. Right?

604
00:36:28,421 --> 00:36:30,689
Ever since my fatal
liposuction procedure,

605
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:32,897
river mind has been a lifesaver.

606
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:36,314
And now there's something
even better. Rivermind Lux.

607
00:36:36,338 --> 00:36:39,522
Rivermind Lux doesn't
just keep your brain running.

608
00:36:39,546 --> 00:36:41,147
It heightens your senses.

609
00:36:41,171 --> 00:36:43,981
Meaning sights, sounds, flavors,

610
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:45,939
even the feeling of this breeze.

611
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,939
In fact, all physical
sensations are simply more

612
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,064
sensational than ever.

613
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:57,171
And you're in charge.

614
00:36:57,755 --> 00:36:59,606
Dial it up or dial it down.

615
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,588
Take control of your mood
with the river mind app.

616
00:37:04,296 --> 00:37:07,231
And with the exclusive
river mind Lux ability browser,

617
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:10,796
you can use skills and attributes
sourced from other river mind users.

618
00:37:11,921 --> 00:37:15,564
So if you thought you couldn't
do park our… think again.

619
00:37:15,588 --> 00:37:16,856
Whoo!

620
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,314
Rivermind Lux.

621
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:21,296
It's life, but not as you know it.

622
00:37:24,755 --> 00:37:28,231
So, if I could have you back over here.

623
00:37:29,421 --> 00:37:31,564
That was pretty cool, right?

624
00:37:31,588 --> 00:37:32,856
Great.

625
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,314
How much does it cost?

626
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:37,689
It's just an additional $1,000 a month.

627
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:41,064
Sweetheart, you'll
wanna watch your head.

628
00:37:41,088 --> 00:37:44,897
We can't… we can barely
afford what we're paying now.

629
00:37:44,921 --> 00:37:50,255
I know. We understand
that Lux is a real vip package.

630
00:37:50,796 --> 00:37:55,397
So if you don't choose to
subscribe to the full-time package,

631
00:37:55,421 --> 00:37:58,272
we actually have temporary boosters

632
00:37:58,296 --> 00:38:00,314
for, like, a few hours.

633
00:38:00,338 --> 00:38:01,546
Or a few days.

634
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:05,189
No? So maybe if you have
a special occasion, Amanda?

635
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:06,939
- We're not interested.
- Okay.

636
00:38:06,963 --> 00:38:08,463
- Thank you.
- I understand.

637
00:38:10,046 --> 00:38:12,171
How much are those booster packs?

638
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:44,630
What have you got, dum dummies?

639
00:38:46,963 --> 00:38:50,880
No, I'm not putting one of
my bunny ears up my a-hole.

640
00:39:21,546 --> 00:39:22,546
Okay.

641
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:28,731
Let's make this fucking quick.

642
00:39:33,963 --> 00:39:34,963
All good?

643
00:39:35,671 --> 00:39:37,106
You feeling okay?

644
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,147
Yep. Free to roam.

645
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:40,255
Okay!

646
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:42,921
It's better than that.

647
00:39:43,588 --> 00:39:45,546
- What do you mean?
- Check the glove box.

648
00:39:52,255 --> 00:39:54,421
That's 12 hours of river mind Lux.

649
00:39:56,088 --> 00:39:58,255
You're gonna have a very good time.

650
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,272
Mike, come on. We can't afford this.

651
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:02,463
I know, I know, I know.

652
00:40:02,963 --> 00:40:04,005
It's one weekend.

653
00:40:05,005 --> 00:40:06,380
I want you to enjoy it.

654
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,963
In fact, I order you to.

655
00:40:10,963 --> 00:40:11,963
Thank you.

656
00:40:16,296 --> 00:40:18,005
Yeah, that's it. You just scratch it.

657
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:21,588
And then you look at the
code, and that activates it.

658
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:28,130
Okay, well, I put the app on your phone.

659
00:40:31,338 --> 00:40:33,755
And then you just dial up your pleasure.

660
00:40:35,755 --> 00:40:37,380
Like this?

661
00:40:38,963 --> 00:40:39,963
That's it.

662
00:40:43,713 --> 00:40:44,713
Wow.

663
00:40:46,088 --> 00:40:47,088
Feel it?

664
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,380
Hi!

665
00:40:59,046 --> 00:41:01,314
I like your truck.

666
00:41:10,088 --> 00:41:11,421
Your hand feels so nice.

667
00:41:12,171 --> 00:41:15,231
- Yeah, yours feel nice.
- Like extra, extra nice.

668
00:41:15,255 --> 00:41:18,689
Two Juniper brat burgers.

669
00:41:18,713 --> 00:41:19,713
Thank you.

670
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,647
Cheers.

671
00:41:22,671 --> 00:41:25,046
Three, two, one.

672
00:41:25,671 --> 00:41:26,731
You're in.

673
00:41:29,213 --> 00:41:31,231
My god.

674
00:41:32,505 --> 00:41:34,897
It's exactly as I remember it. That is

675
00:41:34,921 --> 00:41:36,397
that's pungent.

676
00:41:36,421 --> 00:41:37,463
That is just

677
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:40,213
that's fucking amazing.

678
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:49,231
Look, they're back. Christ.

679
00:41:51,963 --> 00:41:52,963
Babe.

680
00:41:54,296 --> 00:41:55,296
Amanda.

681
00:42:34,546 --> 00:42:37,338
Hey, you don't need to
do all that for me, baby.

682
00:42:37,963 --> 00:42:39,380
It feels so good.

683
00:42:43,046 --> 00:42:45,731
It's just… it sounds like
you're exaggerating a little bit.

684
00:42:45,755 --> 00:42:49,814
I'm not. Your skin feels so fucking good.

685
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:51,213
Yeah.

686
00:42:55,296 --> 00:42:58,772
All right, maybe we can
just dial it down a little bit.

687
00:42:58,796 --> 00:43:00,897
Just literally on the app.

688
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:04,397
- No, no, no, not right now.
- No. Okay. All right.

689
00:43:05,963 --> 00:43:09,689
Jesus Christ. Do you mind
if I just take a little breather?

690
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:10,731
Okay, okay.

691
00:43:12,796 --> 00:43:13,796
Okay, you...

692
00:43:39,338 --> 00:43:40,338
Jesus.

693
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
Babe?

694
00:43:43,296 --> 00:43:45,505
Babe, it's 11:00 A.M.

695
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:50,463
We gotta check out.

696
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,147
I guess Lux is over, then?

697
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,897
Jack, Jack.

698
00:44:13,713 --> 00:44:15,814
- Man.
- Shit.

699
00:44:18,588 --> 00:44:19,647
Jesus.

700
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,380
Morning.

701
00:44:39,921 --> 00:44:40,921
Hey!

702
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:45,921
Mikey! If you're gonna live by the
sword, you're gonna die by it, man.

703
00:44:46,421 --> 00:44:49,981
- Okay. Whoa, watch out now, big guy.
- Fucking arsehole.

704
00:44:50,005 --> 00:44:51,005
Hey, just chill, man.

705
00:44:52,005 --> 00:44:53,897
Fuck. What the fuck?

706
00:44:55,005 --> 00:44:56,897
What, it's not so funny now?

707
00:44:58,005 --> 00:45:00,731
Is that not funny now?
Come on, funny man.

708
00:45:00,755 --> 00:45:02,505
- Give us a fuckin' giggle!
- Let him go.

709
00:45:03,671 --> 00:45:05,772
- Prick.
- You're a fuckin' psycho!

710
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:07,439
Don't fuckin' speak!

711
00:45:07,463 --> 00:45:09,481
Piss-drinking motherfucker!

712
00:45:09,505 --> 00:45:10,588
- Come on!
- Hey!

713
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,397
We're coming, man!

714
00:45:17,421 --> 00:45:19,731
What the fuck are you doing? Back up!

715
00:45:28,838 --> 00:45:30,546
You're home early.

716
00:45:32,755 --> 00:45:33,755
What's wrong?

717
00:45:35,755 --> 00:45:36,755
Mike?

718
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:41,921
Come on, you're scaring me.

719
00:45:49,463 --> 00:45:50,671
I just got fired.

720
00:45:51,505 --> 00:45:52,505
What?

721
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:56,189
But you've worked there for ten years.

722
00:45:56,213 --> 00:45:58,356
I fucked up so bad, babe.

723
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,522
How? What did you...
they can't just fire you.

724
00:46:01,546 --> 00:46:03,213
I don't wanna talk about it.

725
00:46:03,713 --> 00:46:05,439
You get fired and don't
wanna talk about it?

726
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:07,088
Yeah, I don't wanna talk about it.

727
00:46:08,005 --> 00:46:10,130
Wait. So how do we.

728
00:46:11,921 --> 00:46:14,880
I don't… what do we… how do we

729
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,130
how will we pay for river mind plus?

730
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:22,814
- I don't know.
- I… I can't start running ads again.

731
00:46:22,838 --> 00:46:24,963
They won't let me back in school.

732
00:46:29,588 --> 00:46:32,897
Well, we'll… do you know what? We'll
go to river mind and plead our case.

733
00:46:32,921 --> 00:46:34,171
They won't listen.

734
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:38,380
Because we're… we're loyal customers.

735
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,588
Yeah.

736
00:46:41,005 --> 00:46:42,856
She knows us. She… yeah.

737
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,772
- I mean, it's been a long time.
- Yeah?

738
00:46:44,796 --> 00:46:46,380
We pay on time.

739
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:48,338
They have to listen, right?

740
00:46:49,046 --> 00:46:50,046
Yeah.

741
00:46:51,713 --> 00:46:55,481
I am afraid not.

742
00:46:55,505 --> 00:46:59,231
You know, given a little time,
I'm sure I will just get another job.

743
00:46:59,255 --> 00:47:01,772
At Uber, post mates, or whatever.

744
00:47:01,796 --> 00:47:03,731
Great. Yes, that's great.

745
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:04,921
And when you do,

746
00:47:05,546 --> 00:47:08,647
we will reinstate your full subscription.

747
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:10,772
I… I'll lose my job

748
00:47:10,796 --> 00:47:13,296
if, if I can't get back on plus.

749
00:47:13,963 --> 00:47:16,272
- Sorry, plus is actually now standard.
- Please!

750
00:47:16,296 --> 00:47:18,772
- … okay.
- We are good customers

751
00:47:18,796 --> 00:47:22,272
we're just asking for a little credit
so we can get back on our feet.

752
00:47:22,296 --> 00:47:26,689
I understand your circumstances, I do,
but the system won't even let me input it.

753
00:47:26,713 --> 00:47:28,856
- Come on.
- Not even if I try. My hands are tied.

754
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,838
Don't make us use the baby money.

755
00:47:32,171 --> 00:47:33,880
There's… there's still baby money?

756
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,314
- I mean, not fucking much, but yeah.
- You didn't tell me.

757
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:39,981
- Let's not use it.
- I didn't know.

758
00:47:40,005 --> 00:47:42,522
Because if we use it, then
that's it. What's the point?

759
00:47:42,546 --> 00:47:44,064
- Yeah, but...
- that's just giving in.

760
00:47:44,088 --> 00:47:46,939
- Are you trying to get pregnant?
- Surely… yes!

761
00:47:46,963 --> 00:47:48,064
You are?

762
00:47:48,088 --> 00:47:51,856
I mean… we haven't been
trying very hard lately, but

763
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,231
we were hoping for a happy accident.

764
00:47:54,255 --> 00:47:56,130
Okay. But you're not pregnant now.

765
00:47:56,921 --> 00:47:58,088
Why are you asking?

766
00:47:59,005 --> 00:48:00,546
Pregnancy costs extra.

767
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:04,647
When you're pregnant,
it just alters the brain.

768
00:48:04,671 --> 00:48:09,564
There are cortical shifts and
changes to the ventral striatum.

769
00:48:09,588 --> 00:48:13,564
It's a lot for your brain to
process when you're pregnant.

770
00:48:13,588 --> 00:48:14,856
Like, literally.

771
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,814
So it's $90 a month.

772
00:48:18,755 --> 00:48:19,796
Fuck you!

773
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,338
Hey. We're here for the crib.

774
00:49:12,296 --> 00:49:13,296
I'll get it.

775
00:49:21,421 --> 00:49:22,796
Good luck with the baby.

776
00:49:23,546 --> 00:49:25,046
We're not having a baby.

777
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,314
Then why'd you want the crib?

778
00:49:27,338 --> 00:49:29,755
We're setting it on
fire for our music video.

779
00:50:00,963 --> 00:50:02,338
Hey

780
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,463
hey, babe.

781
00:50:11,296 --> 00:50:12,314
Hey.

782
00:50:12,338 --> 00:50:14,171
How are you doing, sleepy head?

783
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:17,838
Happy anniversary.

784
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:20,213
You remembered.

785
00:50:22,088 --> 00:50:23,296
Happy anniversary, babe.

786
00:50:27,421 --> 00:50:29,022
Come with me, please.

787
00:50:42,671 --> 00:50:44,606
I could only afford 30 minutes.

788
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:46,088
Mike.

789
00:50:47,171 --> 00:50:49,838
- How did you even pay for this?
- Don't worry about it.

790
00:50:52,421 --> 00:50:55,647
You told me you weren't
gonna do any more… tooth stuff.

791
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:57,005
No, no. It's just

792
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:01,397
it's a private buyer. It's dum
dummies, but it's a specialist thing.

793
00:51:01,421 --> 00:51:03,546
Don't even think about it. Come on.

794
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:10,814
I'm just gonna slide
your Serenity up to Max.

795
00:51:36,755 --> 00:51:37,963
I think it's time.

796
00:51:45,463 --> 00:51:46,356
- No, I...
- yeah.

797
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,338
- I think we're okay for a little while.
- It's time.

798
00:51:52,755 --> 00:51:54,088
Only if you're sure.

799
00:51:55,463 --> 00:51:56,505
I'm sure.

800
00:51:59,921 --> 00:52:00,921
Okay.

801
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:06,338
Okay.

802
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,171
Do it when I'm not here.

803
00:52:31,171 --> 00:52:32,338
There we go.

804
00:52:36,255 --> 00:52:37,505
Are you comfy, babe?

805
00:52:40,671 --> 00:52:41,713
I love you.

806
00:52:43,463 --> 00:52:44,880
I love you too.

807
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:56,272
- Are you filled with dread?
- Babe!

808
00:52:56,296 --> 00:52:57,606
Wracked with despair?

809
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:59,439
Babe? Not yet.

810
00:52:59,463 --> 00:53:03,171
Let the sun shine in with
endorphox antidepressant lozenges.

811
00:53:05,338 --> 00:53:07,189
- Sustained release.
- It's okay.

812
00:53:07,213 --> 00:53:08,606
Endorphox is…

813
00:53:13,713 --> 00:53:14,772
God.

814
00:53:14,796 --> 00:53:15,856
I love you.
