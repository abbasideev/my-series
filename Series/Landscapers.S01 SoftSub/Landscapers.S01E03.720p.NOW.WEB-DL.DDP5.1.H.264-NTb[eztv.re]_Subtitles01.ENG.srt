1
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,800
Ah.

2
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,280
All right!

3
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,880
So, tell us what brings you
here today, Christopher?

4
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,360
What brings me here today? Erm...

5
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,240
Well...

6
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,360
Um...anyone, really.

7
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,800
Er...

8
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,080
Er, I... I like to read,
which I suppose makes sense.

9
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,960
I'm a librarian.

10
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,600
So, anyone interested in books,
erm, I suppose.

11
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,760
Er, I like films.

12
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,440
'I love going to the cinema.

13
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,800
I like old films especially.

14
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,920
I like, er, romantic films,
um... French films.

15
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,960
Oh, I love old Westerns.

16
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,120
I used to watch those
with my grandfather.'

17
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,360
'The older ones.
Er, Some Like It Hot.

18
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,360
Er, The Golden Age.

19
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,960
Oh, though, I do like...
Oh, what's he called?

20
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,600
Gerard Depardieu.

21
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,320
Erm, yeah, there's something
about him I find quite...'

22
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,400
interesting.

23
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,360
'John Wayne films er...'

24
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,040
I love that film High Noon.

25
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,080
Anything with Gary Cooper in it.

26
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,360
'If you could just tell us
a bit more about who you are...

27
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,240
as a person.'

28
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,280
'Who I am?'

29
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,040
'Yeah, just what sort of person
do you think you are deep down?'

30
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,560
Deep down.
That's quite tricky, isn't it?

31
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,960
'Uh...

32
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,280
Sorry.

33
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,840
Um...

34
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,640
I sup... I'm...'

35
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,000
'Take your time.'

36
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,400
I...um...

37
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,680
Sorry. I didn't expect you
to ask me that.

38
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,600
That's OK.

39
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,600
'He was often
very proud, very stubborn.

40
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,520
Smart boy in many ways.

41
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,520
Could've gone to university.'

42
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,240
But he just wasn't motivated
in that way.

43
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,160
Hard working
but not always productive,

44
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,080
if you know what I mean.

45
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,920
And he didn't want to leave
his mother was the other thing.

46
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,640
Or his brother.

47
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,800
So, he was close to his mum?
And his brother - was it "David"?

48
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,000
Yes.

49
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,600
Yes, it was David.

50
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,240
What about his erm...

51
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,680
relationship with the victims,
the er... Wycherleys?

52
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,560
I only met the Wycherleys once,
at the wedding.

53
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,080
Well, the mother, anyway.

54
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,360
The father
I don't remember that much.

55
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,080
But Chris never really spoke to me
about that kind of thing.

56
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,520
And the truth is he and I
never spoke much about anything.

57
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,760
After he and Susan got married...

58
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,720
..they both just disappeared
into their own world.

59
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,200
How do you mean?

60
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,240
Well, neither of them
are built for THIS one, are they?

61
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,560
If you told me that they'd beamed
their way in on little spaceships,

62
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,800
I'd have half a mind to believe you.

63
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
Oh, don't tell me
I'm onto something.

64
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,560
Are they aliens?

65
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,040
So, this erm...

66
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,440
this might seem like
a stupid question,

67
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,320
but can I ask you
about the word "fragile"?

68
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,000
Chris, he often refers to Susan
as "fragile" in his...

69
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,120
in his emails, in...
in conversation.

70
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,400
Yes.

71
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,960
Yes, he does.

72
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,840
Just wondering what that's about,
I guess.

73
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,200
If you want to understand
my step-son, you should know

74
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,080
that he has always found himself
someone like that.

75
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,200
Someone "fragile", if you like.

76
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,800
Whether it be his mother
or his brother.

77
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,120
It's not my story to tell,
I'm afraid.

78
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,160
But they both died
before their time...

79
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,560
..put it that way.

80
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,680
And Chris took it very, very hard.

81
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,760
Especially when David went.

82
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,680
I'd never seen a man
weep like that before.

83
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,360
Quite harrowing, actually.

84
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,200
It's one of the only times
I ever held him.

85
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,240
He's a lot bigger than me
but, my goodness, did he feel small.

86
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,200
But that's Chris, you see.

87
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,800
He's always trying
to save someone...

88
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
..and he never manages to do it.

89
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,080
Would you like me
to make you a cup of tea?

90
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,640
No, thanks.
I'll be all right in a minute.

91
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,640
OK.

92
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,080
Let me know if you change your mind.

93
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,960
Yes, please, actually.

94
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,280
Two sugars, please.

95
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,120
Need a bit of a pick-me-up.
Coming right up!

96
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,320
'Dear Gerard Depardieu,

97
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,120
my husband and I are huge fans
of your work,

98
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,440
particularly the dramas,

99
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,960
though we also think
you're an excellent comedic actor.

100
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,760
I am writing to ask you most humbly
for a signed photograph.

101
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,120
I would love to give this
to my husband, Chris,

102
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,240
to lift his spirits,
as he has recently been bereaved.

103
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,720
He tragically lost his dear brother
David several months ago

104
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,400
and has been inconsolable
ever since.

105
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,440
I know that a message and a gift
from you would give him strength.

106
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,480
We live in England
but we love France.

107
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,880
We think you live in the most
romantic country in the world.

108
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,000
Un grand merci in advance,
Mr Depardieu.

109
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,920
Yours faithfully, Susan Edwards.

110
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,600
Susan's at her parents' house
in Mansfield - without Chris.

111
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,120
He's back in London.

112
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,960
Her mother, Patricia Wycherley -
possible drink problem.

113
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,440
Her father, William,
was sexually abusive towards Susan.

114
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,400
Allegedly.
Let's assume it's true.

115
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,400
Patricia shoots her husband.

116
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,040
She's pissed. Some kind of row.

117
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,560
Bang, bang. First question -
why has Patricia got a gun?

118
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,120
Patricia drops the gun.

119
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,640
Susan picks it up.

120
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,560
Patricia says horrible things
to Susan, winds her up -

121
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,920
Bang, bang again.
Whoops, Mum's dead too.

122
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,600
She cannelloni's her parents
in a blanket and leaves them
under the bed for a week.

123
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,440
Correct, sir. Then she gets
the coach back down to London,

124
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,920
tells her husband
her parents are off to Blackpool,

125
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,760
so they need to house-sit.

126
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,200
They head back up to Mansfield.
Fish supper.

127
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,080
Susan can't take it any more.
Spills the beans.

128
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,160
Husband digs a massive hole,
buries both bodies in the garden.

129
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,000
And we think
that's a load of old...?

130
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,480
Bullshit!
Good.

131
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,800
So, first task
is to prove that it's rubbish.

132
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,760
Second task is to work out
what actually happened.

133
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,400
Was it premeditated?
Are we looking at joint enterprise?

134
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,840
If so, how do we convince the CPS?

135
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,960
'For the record,
I'm placing evidence
from Catalogue A on the table.'

136
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,520
Gary Cooper.

137
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,040
President Eisenhower.

138
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,640
John Wayne.

139
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,200
Kirk Douglas.

140
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,160
Sir Winston Churchill.

141
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,840
Charles de Gaulle.

142
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,400
Personal correspondence
with the actor Gerard Depardieu.

143
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,400
Oh, yes, Gerard.
Be very careful with those, please.

144
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,480
Are you friends with him,
Mr Edwards?

145
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,760
Not exactly.

146
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,680
Susan wrote to him once
and we just stayed in touch.

147
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,440
All right.

148
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,960
These are all glamorous men,
aren't they?

149
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,960
Heroic men.

150
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,840
How do YOU fit into that?

151
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,400
This is all you brought back
with you from France.

152
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,520
It's all you've got left, in't it?

153
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,040
No money in the bank.

154
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,840
No other assets to speak of.

155
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,840
Half of it bought behind your back

156
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,120
with credit cards
you had to work to pay off.

157
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,920
She was using money you had earned
to buy tat.

158
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,800
Look...

159
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,640
..this may not be to your taste,
but it is not tat.

160
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,880
Some of these are highly
sought-after and very rare.

161
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Actually, Susan has immaculate taste
when it comes to things like this.

162
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
700 quid.

163
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,040
Don't know what you paid for it,
but we've had it appraised at 700.

164
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,680
It is, I'm afraid,
what we call in the business...

165
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,240
a big old pile of useless tat.

166
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,640
You're lying.

167
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,240
I can do that?

168
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,960
It's all right, love.

169
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,160
We've, er...
We've got some, have we?

170
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,040
In the spice drawer.

171
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,480
Oh! Dang it.

172
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,880
The top's come off!
They've gone everywhere.

173
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,320
No, no, no, you finish your eggs
in peace.

174
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,320
It's my mess.
Dustpan's under the sink!

175
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,440
You all right?

176
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,240
No, er... They've scurried into
all the nooks and corners.

177
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,120
I need the hoover.
Oh, no. I can do that.
It's a bit of a jumble.

178
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,880
I'm not a baby, Susan.

179
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,920
And it's hardly a jumble.

180
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,640
What are these?

181
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,680
This is a lot of money, Susan.
It's an investment. We can sell it.

182
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,840
Picture Show Magazine, £400.
It's signed by Gary Cooper!

183
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,240
That's not the point!
We don't have this money!

184
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,360
We've never had this money.
I don't earn enough.

185
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,600
I was gonna tell you about that one.

186
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,240
"Dear Mr Wycherley..."
This is to your father.

187
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,120
Look, I can explain.
"As you are about to turn 100,

188
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,640
we at the Department
for Work and Pensions

189
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,080
would like to visit you
at the above address

190
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,560
to conduct an in-person interview"!

191
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,400
But it...it's OK.

192
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,040
How is it OK? We've told 'em he's
living with us. He isn't, is he?

193
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,400
No, but I wrote to them
and asked them to delay.

194
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,320
It doesn't matter how long we wait.

195
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,880
Your father's never gonna
attend this interview, is he?

196
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,240
I know that.
What did you think would happen?

197
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,320
Hey? Why did you hide
this letter from me?

198
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,840
'It's a compulsion.
It's her way of dealing
with things that er...

199
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,440
It's like she's trying
to buy back the happiness

200
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,240
that her parents
stole away from her.'

201
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,040
But that was when she was a child -
three decades earlier.

202
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,720
She's a grown woman now.

203
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,040
I assume you're trying
to goad me into something

204
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,920
by deliberately oversimplifying,

205
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,440
but it's clear that these
experiences are not...

206
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,320
You can't just shake them off.

207
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,240
And besides, William and Patricia

208
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,200
never stopped being horrible to her.

209
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,920
They never stopped trying to take

210
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,840
every chance of happiness
away from her.

211
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,960
You must have hated them.
No, I tried not to.

212
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,280
This was very difficult.
I tried not to get involved -

213
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,560
So, what did they do
to "steal her happiness"?

214
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,440
Well, they were
abusive to her verbally,

215
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,480
they constantly
undermined her confidence

216
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,080
and on one occasion,
they literally stole from her.

217
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,240
What I mean is, they were -
They stole from her?

218
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,680
In a way, yes,
that's just a small example,

219
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,440
but what I mean is they were...

220
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,480
in general, they...

221
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,480
they were not at all nice to her.

222
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,360
What did they steal from her, Chris?
Oh, look, "steal"...

223
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,280
"stole", that's an exaggeration.

224
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,040
What I mean is Susan...

225
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,440
This is the power they had over her.

226
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,360
She gave it to them
quite willingly as a gift.

227
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,320
Because she wanted them to like her.
Which I never understood -

228
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,160
A gift of what?
Well, money, essentially.

229
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,120
Well, when was this?
Oh, I can't remember.

230
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,840
It was that long ago.

231
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,200
Maybe the late...'80s.

232
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,120
And it wasn't money as such,
it was that,

233
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,720
look, they had
shared ownership in a house.

234
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,440
Susan and I were married now
so we moved into my flat,

235
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,040
and they -
the...the Wycherleys - they...

236
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,880
..well, they thought
it'd be better if...

237
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,840
If Susan just handed over
her share to them?

238
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,360
Oh...

239
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,160
'Susan had helped them
buy it some years previously,

240
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,000
so her name was on the deeds.'

241
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,480
'She helped them buy it?'
'Yes, they...'

242
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,640
Hi.

243
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,880
'She'd received an inheritance
from her grandfather...

244
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,400
on her mother's side.

245
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,240
He was the one who got her into
all the old Western movies.

246
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,880
He was a... He was a war hero,

247
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,480
and somewhat confusingly about
the same age as William, her dad.

248
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,560
William hated him, of course, but
William seemed to hate everyone.'

249
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,560
William.
Good to see you.

250
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,840
Ah, likewise. Likewise, yeah.

251
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,560
Go on through.

252
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,880
Oh.

253
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,600
'And so, did her mum not inherit
anything herself, then?'

254
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,440
'No. That was the tricky thing.

255
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,480
I suppose, because of
the animosity with William,

256
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,600
her father didn't want William
to get his hands on it,

257
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,160
so he just left it all to Susan.'

258
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,400
Chris, perhaps you could
take William off for a port.

259
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,520
We don't have any port.
Or something.

260
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,680
You know...leave us girls
to have a little catch-up.

261
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,680
What's your poison, William?

262
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,640
My wife.

263
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,280
You have no idea how awful it is.

264
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,000
My life shouldn't have been
like this, Susan.

265
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,840
I used to have friends.

266
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,960
Used to laugh.

267
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,840
Oh, Mum. It's not so bad.
You've still got me.

268
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,200
You've no fucking idea, Susan.

269
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,280
You've escaped.
I'm stuck with him.

270
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,480
I'm sorry.

271
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,480
No, I'm sorry, Susan.

272
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,480
I'm not myself.

273
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,480
How's your organ?
Broken.

274
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,240
Patricia hammering away on it
with her fat fingers.

275
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,880
I'm going for a pee.

276
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,160
Do you want anything while I'm up?
Again?

277
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,920
You've got the bladder of a mouse.
A lady mouse.

278
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,720
That was MY money.

279
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,280
He was my father, Susan!

280
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,840
Oh, you can be a thoughtless
little bitch sometimes.

281
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,240
I'm sorry, Susan.

282
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,280
I never mean to hurt you.

283
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,400
You know that, don't you?

284
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,720
Will you consider it?

285
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,400
Give your poor old mother
a bit of peace?

286
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,360
Just consider it a loan.

287
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,480
That's all it is.

288
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,560
A simple loan.

289
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,480
'So, she signs it over?'
'Yes.'

290
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,160
'And what happens to the house?'

291
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,120
It's all too predictable,
I'm afraid.

292
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,320
Before the ink is dry
on the transfer deed,

293
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,400
they sell the house - for a very
healthy profit I might add -

294
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,520
and they sod off up to Mansfield.

295
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,040
To Mansfield?
Yes.

296
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,040
Gosh, I can see how that
might have exercised you.

297
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,360
Well, no, I'm not...
I... I wasn't exercised.

298
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,360
I was more regretful, I suppose.
But one tries to rise above it.

299
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,840
Please don't be angry with me -
How can you be so stupid?!

300
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,360
'It's your money! It's our money!'

301
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,040
And you just let 'em take it

302
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,120
like they've taken every other
bloody thing from you!

303
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,920
They promised they wouldn't sell it.

304
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,760
Their promises are worth nothing!
Of course, they're gonna sell it.

305
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,280
They're liars.
The whole lot of you are liars!

306
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,760
Why can't you ever learn, Susan?

307
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,200
I tell you what. Why don't
we do something else for a bit?

308
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,520
We could play I Spy. Erm...

309
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,520
There's about five things
in this room.

310
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,640
Or we could play cards.

311
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,320
I don't have any cards.

312
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,240
Or we could chat, you know.

313
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,160
I guess, the point is to keep
your mind off things for a bit
so it's not gonna...

314
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,640
What about YOUR life?
Er... Er, yeah.

315
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,280
Yeah, er...

316
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,960
Or we could play that game
where it's like erm...

317
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,920
the first letter is the last
letter of the word before -

318
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,440
What's your father like?

319
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,320
Er... Hmm.

320
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,520
My dad erm...

321
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,520
My dad wasn't around much.

322
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,040
Which is kind of a cliche,
I guess, but it's true.

323
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,120
What about your mum?
I love my mum. She's amazing.

324
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,680
And a wife?

325
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,040
I've...got a girlfriend.

326
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,080
And you know what, actually, erm...

327
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,360
..last night, on my way home,
I was...

328
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,960
I was thinking about
the way you talk about Chris.

329
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,760
I hope she talks about me that way.

330
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,520
Like how you stick up for him
and stuff.

331
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,240
See, I don't know, erm...
I don't know.

332
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,080
That's real, isn't it?

333
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,880
You really love him.

334
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,200
Sorry.

335
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,720
'She didn't step up
to the plate like you'd hoped.

336
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,880
You wanted her
to stand up for herself
but she's refused to change.'

337
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,520
No. She wanted to.
She tried to. But she couldn't.

338
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,800
So, it should have been YOU
stepping up to the plate?

339
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,160
I couldn't know
what the Wycherleys were up to -

340
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,280
You were watching telly with the man
who'd sexually abused your wife

341
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,040
while her mother
stole her inheritance.

342
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,440
That is unfairly reductive.
And on that night,

343
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,280
when the Wycherleys
were shot and killed,

344
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,360
you did exactly the same thing,
didn't you?

345
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,480
You abandoned Susan to her parents.
No, I did not.

346
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,440
You let her go alone
up to Mansfield

347
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,480
to visit the two people
she hated most in the world.

348
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,600
And look what happened to her.

349
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,200
Unless that is when you see it.

350
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,120
That Susan is never gonna change.

351
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,920
That she can't suddenly
start standing up for herself.

352
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,400
And that's when you realise
that you have to.

353
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,400
I was not in Mansfield the weekend
the Wycherleys were killed.

354
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,600
I wish I was. I might have been able
to prevent this from happening.

355
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,320
But I was in Dagenham.

356
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,440
Here we go.

357
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,600
For the record,
I'm showing the suspect item PW-56.

358
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,000
Paid another visit
to your step-mother today, Chris.

359
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,480
And, erm...she lent us
this box of photos.

360
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,720
Is that your mother-in-law -
Patricia?

361
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,160
Yes.

362
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,440
Where's William?

363
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,640
He... He didn't come.

364
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,080
He didn't approve of me marrying
his daughter...for some reason.

365
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,560
And, er, did that... Did that hurt?
Not really.

366
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,360
Is that your mum - Ange?

367
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,600
Yes.

368
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,200
And is that your brother - David?
Mm, yes.

369
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,400
So um...

370
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,480
Emma and I had a chat and we don't
wanna put you through something

371
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,720
which is obviously...very painful,

372
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,200
but the feeling is,
is that this erm...

373
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,440
history, if you like,

374
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,360
it may be relevant to the case.

375
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,200
So do you mind if we ask you
a couple more questions?

376
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,640
Look, Chris, my dad's a drinker,

377
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,920
so I've got "fragile"
in the family as well.

378
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,680
And...don't get me wrong,
I love my dad.

379
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,040
But, by God, is he exhausting.

380
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,520
Every time the phone rings,

381
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,520
I know it's gonna be
some kind of drama.

382
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,720
But do you know what makes me
angrier than anything else?

383
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,920
Watching my mum pour all her energy
into worrying.

384
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,480
They're not even together any more

385
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,840
and yet still
every decision she makes

386
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,040
revolves around him
and his drinking.

387
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,560
And I've told her a million times...

388
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,080
..let it go.

389
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,560
It's not worth it.

390
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,080
Because some people are beyond help,
aren't they, really?

391
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,160
Let's face it.

392
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,280
Stop trying to help people
who can't be helped.

393
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,720
Look where it's got you both.

394
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,680
I don't agree with you.

395
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,840
I don't agree that
anyone's beyond help.

396
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Nobody's beyond help in this world.

397
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,240
That's the whole point
of this world.

398
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,040
Not my mother...

399
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,600
not David and certainly not Susan.

400
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,320
I wasn't trying to save my mother
or save my brother.

401
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,400
I was trying to love them.

402
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,960
And that's all I've ever done
with Susan, is love her.

403
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,200
But how will she explain to a jury
that she cleared out

404
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,200
her parents' bank account
the day after they were shot dead?

405
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,280
No-one's gonna buy she was provoked.

406
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,520
She's going down
for double murder, Chris,

407
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,240
and the fact that you love her
is not gonna change anything.

408
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,160
She didn't shoot them both.
She couldn't have -

409
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,440
Yes, she could.
No, she couldn't.

410
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,280
The nature of the bullet wounds
indicate that whoever shot William

411
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,000
also shot -

412
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,120
She couldn't have done it.
She's terrified of guns.

413
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,400
What do you mean
she's terrified of guns?

414
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,680
Oh, Susan.

415
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,800
I know what this
is going to look like.

416
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,480
But I have to stand up for my wife.

417
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,640
I know she couldn't have
killed them both.

418
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,600
I know she was terrified of guns

419
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,680
because I used to belong
to a gun club.

420
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,920
I used to own guns myself, in fact.
I owned two pistols.

421
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,560
'Both of which I got rid of
long before the Wycherleys died,

422
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,280
before the Dunblane law even,

423
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,200
when I would've had
to turn them in, anyway.'

424
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,120
But I dragged Susan along
to the range once or twice,

425
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:54,800
and she couldn't even
bring herself to touch a gun,
much less shoot one. So I know...

426
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,960
that she could never have killed
two people with a gun.

427
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,360
She could never have contemplated
killing two people with a gun.

428
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,160
That is impossible.

429
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,360
'So, that awful weekend in May
when you were alone -

430
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,760
you say - your parents are dead,

431
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,200
you're up all night wondering
how to dispose of the bodies...

432
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,760
what to do with the gun,

433
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,480
sleeping in that house

434
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,800
and then going
and opening that bank account.

435
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,960
That's a lot for anyone
to go through, Susan.

436
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,920
And for someone "fragile" like you.'

437
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,000
'Can you get to the point, please?

438
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,520
My client is pretty exhausted
already from waiting all day,

439
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,920
so I think the least you could do
is to be concise.'

440
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,120
'The point is, Susan,
we can't imagine you
going through it on your own.

441
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,600
We think Chris helped you.
Which means we're not
asking for manslaughter.'

442
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,920
We're recommending murder.
For both of you.

443
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,240
No.
We think Chris was with you
that first weekend -

444
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,840
probably the only weekend -
and you murdered them together
and then he buried them.

445
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,440
No!
What are you basing this on?

446
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,760
You both felt you were owed money
from that house.

447
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,560
No...er... The house?
In Edgware.

448
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,440
The one they "stole" from you -
to quote your husband.

449
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,920
Let me tell you
what our report's gonna say.

450
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,720
See if it makes sense to you.

451
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,640
Come on, Susan.
I'm sorry, but I have to object.

452
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,600
You, too. This way.
Where are you going?

453
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,920
What's happening?
Shall I bring the camera, Emma?

454
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,720
Nah.
You don't have to follow them.

455
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,160
Where are you going!
Susan!

456
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,280
Chop, chop.
You don't have to go with them.

457
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,080
You can come back! Susan.

458
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,920
No -
Grant, come on.

459
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,200
Excuse me. Sorry. No!

460
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,560
Where are you going? No!

461
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,520
Susan!

462
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,480
Good evening, you two.
You're looking fresher
than when I last saw you.

463
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,120
Oh, stop it. Isn't she funny?

464
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,400
Where shall I stand?

465
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,360
Or... Or... Or shall I sit?

466
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,360
Shall... Shall I plug in?

467
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,960
Nah, you're all right.

468
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,760
Ah. Come through.

469
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,360
No, because this is silly.
Oh, hello, darlings!

470
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,160
Don't you look lovely.

471
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,760
Come in, come in.

472
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,440
Hello, my girl!
Fuck you, Dad!

473
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,560
No. I wouldn't say that
because I don't swear.

474
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,400
William. Good to see you.
Yeah, good to see you, too.

475
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,520
Ow, why are you squeezing my hand
so hard?

476
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,040
Because of what you did to my wife.
That's a bit much, don't you think?

477
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,320
This is not how it happened.
No, it didn't.

478
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,480
It didn't happen like this!

479
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,000
I keep telling you,
Chris wasn't there!

480
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,800
Hello, darling.
What you doing?

481
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,320
Mr Wycherley, excuse me, sir.

482
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,520
Would you mind getting up?
Delighted.

483
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,360
Unless one of you tells us, Susan,

484
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,560
we're never gonna know
exactly what happened -

485
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,120
whether you're all having
a nice time,

486
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,720
or you're all having a row,
or what -

487
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,000
but sooner or later you had them
both up here in the bedroom.

488
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,080
Right, can you give me the...

489
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,440
Now? OK?

490
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,760
Actually, William and Patricia...
Yes, ma'am?

491
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,920
This is ridiculous.
Could you get into bed and go
to sleep? That makes more sense.

492
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,160
That's a good note.
Thank you, Officer.

493
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,320
Patricia would probably be
sleeping quite lightly, I think,

494
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,000
because of her back pain.
Yeah, OK.

495
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,160
Right, all yours, Chris.

496
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,960
Woah...sorry.

497
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,920
No, just don't worry about that.

498
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,680
Right, yes. Ah...

499
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,880
We think Chris was with you
that first weekend -

500
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,960
probably the only weekend -
and you murdered them together.

501
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,360
Then, over the next couple of days,
he buried the bodies -

502
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,120
No, that was the following weekend.

503
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,440
The weekend
of the Eurovision Song Contest.

504
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,480
Because we stayed up
to watch it on television

505
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,080
while our neighbours went to bed,
so we could bury the bodies.

506
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,800
I remember it was the year
that Dana International won -

507
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,720
Dana Inter...
You never give up, do you?

508
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,880
Chris informed us that he used
to have a couple of revolvers.

509
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,640
.38s, as it happens.
Susan...you're within your rights
to take five to discuss this.

510
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,920
That was a long time ago.
He got rid of them.

511
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,960
He says you couldn't stand guns.
That's right.

512
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,440
I was terrified -
Terrified of them. Yeah, he said.

513
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,640
Couldn't even bring yourself
to touch one.

514
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,080
You don't think
that's his way of telling us
- that HE did the shooting?
- No!

515
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,320
Kind of like when he called
his step-mother... No, no!

516
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,440
He's not confessing to anything!
Susan.

517
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,640
- What?!
- Are you sure
you don't wanna discuss this?

518
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,200
What difference would that make?!
I can advise you on how best to -

519
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,360
How to what?
There's a lot being discussed -

520
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,960
We are not murderers!
She's calling me a murderer!

521
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,600
I don't know what he was thinking,
telling you about his guns.
That's not clever.

522
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,680
But doesn't it just show you, like
when he called his step-mother -

523
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,160
which he was very hurt by,
by the way she betrayed him -

524
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,760
doesn't that just show you
he has nothing to hide?

525
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,640
If you want to know
where the gun came from,
it was my father's, actually.

526
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,880
And you're gonna think
this is a lie but...

527
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,400
but he actually was fascinated
by fascist iconography and Nazis.

528
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,360
Susan -
This is the truth! Believe me.

529
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,520
He had a collection in a cabinet
and we got rid of them

530
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,440
because we didn't like
having them in the house.

531
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,720
So we got rid of everything.
You have to believe me. Please.

532
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,160
Are you done?

533
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,560
In truth, it no longer matters
what I believe.

534
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,920
We're gonna stop there, Susan.
Thank you.

535
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,960
We're going to prison.

536
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,880
My Chris is going to prison
and I'll never see him again.

537
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,560
You can get through this, Susan.

538
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,720
Um, you have to stay calm.

539
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,640
It... It's...
There's a whole trial yet, OK?

540
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,360
You have to trust me.
When will I see Chris again?

541
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,080
I... I...
Maybe not for a while but...

542
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,960
I mean, if...
if the trial does happen,

543
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,720
I'll make sure he finds
a really good lawyer and...

544
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,160
If you do get charged
and prison does happen,

545
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,800
for either one of you,

546
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,440
once you get your head around it,
it's not so bad.

547
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,240
OK? It's actually a lot more
comfortable than being in here.

548
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,640
You just have to trust me -
I don't trust you!

549
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,760
I don't trust anyone except Chris.

550
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,760
Fair enough. I get it, I get it.
And I know you're upset. I just...

551
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,080
I'm very sorry, but you
have to keep it together, OK.

552
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,360
I get it. Honestly, I do -
You don't get it!

553
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,640
You don't. You don't get it!
Susan, I...I...

554
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,760
Why didn't you stop them?!
You didn't do anything!

555
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,640
I'm sorry if you're not happy
with how I represented you,

556
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,480
but it's a big case for me, Susan,
and I just...

557
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,000
I... I didn't know...
I didn't know about the house.

558
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,680
I didn't know
about the bank account.

559
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,920
I didn't know about Chris
and his guns.

560
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,520
You didn't tell me -
I wasn't supposed to tell you,
so why would I tell you?!

561
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,480
Yeah, OK.

562
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,920
Stupid Chris. What is he doing?

563
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,040
He's been in questioning for
two days straight without support.

564
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,040
It's tough, Susan. People break.

565
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,840
It's so tough.

566
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,760
Erm, OK, OK, listen.

567
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,960
I don't normally tell anybody
about this -

568
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,640
at least not my clients - because
I'm not really proud of it, but...

569
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,800
..if it makes you feel any better,
I have... I've been to prison.

570
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,720
Yeah, I know, but it's true.

571
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,600
And, OK, it was when I was younger,
er, silly stuff.

572
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,880
Getting into fights and so on,
but...but, look, I had my mum.

573
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,760
And I had my girl,
the same way you have Chris.

574
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,520
And now here I am.
That's not the same thing.

575
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,440
What's not the same thing?

576
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,880
It's not the same thing!

577
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,000
Chris is the only thing I love
and I can't lose...

578
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,040
I can't lose him. I can't.

579
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,480
All right!

580
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,560
All right, calm down.
You're not getting a table dance.

581
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,840
Obviously, a lot of hard graft
has gone into this -

582
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,280
including all you lot
behind the scenes.

583
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,880
But I think we can all agree

584
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,200
that DC Lancing and DC Wilkie
have done us proud.

585
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,400
Howdy, Sheriff.
Fair fucks to you, Emma -
balls of steel.

586
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,320
We can be pretty confident now
that the story that pair
of vampires came in with

587
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,240
is as fairy-tale
as Father Fucking Christmas.

588
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,800
Except Santa never killed anyone,
as far as we know.

589
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,480
We ain't caught him yet, anyway.
But, on a serious note,

590
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,360
the hope is
that because of our work,

591
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,360
a double murder has been solved

592
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,280
and two cold-hearted criminals
will be brought to justice.

593
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,280
And that's what it's all about.

594
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,560
That's what gets me up
in the morning....

595
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,520
..and that's why I love this job.

596
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,440
If the lawyers don't fuck it up.

597
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,920
That's right, Paul.
It's all down to them
wiggy bloody penguins now.

598
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,360
That's why they get paid
the big bucks, is it?

599
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,160
So, anyway, good work.

600
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,920
Let's have a few drinks,
big case but onto the next one.

601
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,240
Come on!

602
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,400
To justice.

603
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,480
Right, who's got the bottle opener?

604
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,120
Right, good work.

605
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,400
'"Dear Chris,
thank you for the kind letter

606
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,160
requesting a signed photograph,
which I include in this envelope.

607
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,000
I cannot imagine the pain that
you are suffering at the moment

608
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,560
and I wish
that I could take it away."'

609
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,880
'Hello?'
Hiya, Dad.

610
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,680
'Is that you, ducky?'

611
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,000
Yeah. You all right?

612
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,400
'Yeah, I'm all right. Are you?'

613
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,040
Yeah.

614
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,920
'This is a nice surprise.'

615
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,440
'"In life,
there are moments of darkness.

616
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,680
I have experienced many
in my life, too.

617
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,800
But I know there will always be
some hope to come around the corner.

618
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,600
My dear Chris, at times of darkness
it is natural to grieve,

619
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,520
but you must not despair.

620
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,480
Your beautiful brother David
is in heaven amongst the angels

621
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,560
where there is only light,

622
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,280
and you will see him once more
in this place.

623
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,840
Please write to me again.

624
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,960
I would be very happy
to be your friend.

625
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,760
Yours sincerely, Gerard Depardieu."'

626
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,280
I can't believe it.

627
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:28,200
I can't believe that someone like
that would write to people like us.

628
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,840
Can you?

629
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,120
Yeah, it's definitely surprising.

630
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,200
What an extraordinary gesture.

631
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,360
What an extraordinary man.

632
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,520
Yeah. Has it made you feel better?

633
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,800
I think it has.

634
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,120
It's made me feel like
there's some good in the world

635
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,480
and it's important
to be reminded of that, isn't it?

636
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,320
Yeah, definitely.

637
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,760
Gerard Depardieu
friends with the likes of us.

638
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,600
Can I tell you a secret?

639
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,560
A secret?

640
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,680
When I was a little girl...

641
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,240
and I used to go for walks
sometimes on my own

642
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,080
just to get away from Mum and Dad
when they were fighting

643
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,760
or, you know, there was this horse
I used to go and look at

644
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,440
every now and then.

645
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,920
And I never knew whose it was...

646
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,480
but he'd just stand around
in his bit of field by the road,

647
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,440
eating the grass
and getting on with his day.

648
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,240
And...
And I'd talk to him sometimes.

649
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,720
Did you?
Yeah.

650
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,720
Out loud?
Yeah. I called it Susan.

651
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,880
You didn't.
I did.

652
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,800
And I'd say,
"Hello, Susan, how are you today?

653
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,880
I hope you're enjoying
your lovely grass.

654
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,120
Oh, it's windy today,
isn't it, Susan?"

655
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,960
And stuff like that.

656
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,320
And then when I'd get home,
I'd sit on the sofa like this...

657
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,560
..and I'd look at the back...

658
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,360
and, you see where the...
the line meets the wall?

659
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,640
Can you see? Like a horizon?

660
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,400
Oh. Oh, yeah.

661
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,720
And I used to imagine
that the wall was the sky

662
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,760
and that this was the great big
dusty plain like in the films.

663
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,320
And then I'd picture
a tiny little Susan

664
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,800
galloping and galloping for hours...

665
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,920
..and I used to sit and imagine it.

666
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,800
Can you see?

667
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,680
Yes, I can.

668
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,800
Yeah.

669
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,360
That's my life, isn't it, Chris?
That horse.

670
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,920
I suppose it is, yes.

671
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,600
And now since I've met you,
I imagine you on the horse.

672
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,640
Me?
Yeah. And I'm with you.

673
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,160
And we're riding and riding
across the plain,

674
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,120
the wind in our hair...

675
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,640
and I'm holding onto you
as tight as I can.

676
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,440
And then what happens?

677
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,040
Nothing.

678
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,840
Just ride, Chris. Just ride.

679
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,440
Well...

680
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,080
I'm afraid I don't know
how to ride a horse...

681
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,520
..but I can learn.

682
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,040
'In 2005, the Edwards
faked signatures on documents.'

683
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,640
'And around the same time, the
couple's bank account was drained.'

684
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,520
'In later years,
the house was sold...

685
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,080
and benefits were
claimed in their names.'

686
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,720
'They had taken something
in the region of £300,000

687
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,440
and they appear to have spent
every single penny of it.'

688
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,760
'But the deceit didn't end there.

689
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,320
To cover up what they'd done,

690
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,200
the couple also tricked
friends and family

691
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,840
into thinking the Wycherleys
were still alive.

692
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,680
At this point,
William and Patricia Wycherley
had been dead for 13 years.

693
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,560
But the Edwards
eventually ran out of luck.

694
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,040
On what would have been
William Wycherley's 100th birthday,

695
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,800
the Department of Work and Pensions
wrote him a letter,

696
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,960
asking to see him.'

697
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,600
'This was a double murder
motivated by money.'

698
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,280
'Motivated by greed.'

699
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,400
'The Edwards have insisted
they've told the truth.

700
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,080
But police say that from the moment
they were arrested,

701
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,200
the couple have displayed
a heartless attitude.'

702
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,960
'Christopher and Susan Edwards

703
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,880
will appear before
a Crown Court judge on Monday.'

704
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,800
