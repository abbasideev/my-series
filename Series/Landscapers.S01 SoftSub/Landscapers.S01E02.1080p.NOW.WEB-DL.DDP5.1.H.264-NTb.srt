1
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,040
'Just remember.'

2
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,120
One step at a time...

3
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,440
like we said.

4
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,200
They arrest us,
they read us our rights.

5
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,800
We know what we're gonna say.

6
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,440
We've gone through it
a thousand times, and we're ready.

7
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,080
Just don't say a word
without a solicitor. Right?

8
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,640
And remember... you're in charge.

9
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,720
'Then come the police interviews.'

10
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,600
'They'll try to confuse you,
but don't let them.'

11
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,320
'Just tell our story
simply and calmly.

12
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,920
No need to make anything up.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,400
Just tell them the truth.'

14
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,920
'Ah, hello there, Mrs Edwards.'

15
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,320
'Oh, hello. It's Susan Edwards.
You're being offered as my, um...?'

16
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,320
'Yes. My name is Douglas Hylton.
I'm coming in to help you tonight.'

17
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,200
'Oh, good, because you've heard,
I think, that my husband and I

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,800
got ourselves into
a bit of a pickle.

19
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,600
- I know it sounds all rather morbid.'
- 'Susan. Susan, sorry, can I...'

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,240
'So, for his sake, everyone should
know the truth from the outset.'

21
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,760
'Susan, this isn't a private call.
I'm not your representative yet.

22
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,440
That's what I'm coming to do now,

23
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,560
to take your instruction,
and then I can...

24
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,280
Does that make sense?'
'I see. Yes, sorry, silly old me.'

25
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,320
Just tell our story simply...
and calmly.

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,560
No need to make anything up.

27
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,120
Just tell them the truth.

28
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,360
Oh.

29
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,880
Thank you.

30
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,600
- Morning, Susan.
- Oh, you came back, then.

31
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,680
- How was your night?
- Oh, you know.

32
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,160
Yeah. First night's the worst.
Ah... the waiting.

33
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,080
Yeah. And also
just not being with Chris.

34
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,600
Even though he's just down
the corridor. Very peculiar.

35
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,080
- Yeah.
- Still, not for long, though.

36
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,400
- Huh?
- Sorry.

37
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,400
Ah! Thank you.

38
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,960
Erm, Douglas, I was wondering...

39
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,120
You know your advice...

40
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,760
about not telling
the police anything.

41
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Is that because you
don't believe us?

42
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,000
Um, no. It's just to keep it simple,
so that we don't get tripped up.

43
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,040
To be honest, it's not my job
to have an opinion, really.

44
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,560
My job is to help you.

45
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
So, when the police start asking
questions, I just ignore them?

46
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,400
You simply let them know
you prefer not to answer.

47
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,800
Most people like to go with,
"No comment."

48
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,760
"No comment" to everything.
At least until we know... more.

49
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,360
You've gotta remember,
they've only got until tonight

50
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,000
to convince the CPS
that they have enough evidence

51
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,920
to win a trial or get an extension.

52
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,920
If you and Chris don't give them
anything, you might go free.

53
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,480
I can't promise, but it does happen.

54
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,040
OK. So, "No comment."

55
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,760
And how do we let Chris know that
that's the new plan?

56
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,920
I... Erm, we... we don't.

57
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,640
The police aren't mega-keen
on suspects sharing tactics.

58
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,920
It's just Chris never said anything
about "no comment".

59
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,200
We agreed that we would
just tell our story.

60
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,200
We would never have handed ourselves in
if we thought we had something to hide.

61
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,280
OK, erm...

62
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,040
Tell you what...

63
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,360
How about we...

64
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,400
...write a brief statement.

65
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,160
Just the basics.

66
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,880
Your story in your words,
very short, which I'll read out.

67
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,560
- And after that...
- "No comment."

68
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,520
Ah, got it. Erm... OK.

69
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,440
So, go for it, as simply as you can.

70
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,760
OK, erm...

71
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,720
The day before my parents' deaths,

72
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,640
I took a National Express coach

73
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,000
from Victoria Coach Station
to Mansfield.

74
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,080
It was route number four-five-O--
it was then...

75
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,160
Er, Susan, sorry.
Could you slow down a bit?

76
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,320
- Oh, sorry, sorry.
- We don't need the routes and so on.

77
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,320
- Just the important stuff.
- Oh, OK.

78
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,640
- 'Ey up. How you feeling?
- Fucking wired, mate.

79
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,400
Yeah? Nervous?

80
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,080
Nah, I'm not nervous. I'm wired.
There's a difference.

81
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,760
It's like there's a little bit of shit in
my pants, but I'm also really excited.

82
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,680
Ah, all power to you, mate.

83
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,000
It's just 15 years, long time
to get their story straight.

84
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,440
'Just tell our story...
simply and calmly.

85
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,840
No need to make anything up.

86
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,280
Just tell them the truth.'

87
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,880
'"On the weekend of
my parents' deaths, in May 1998,

88
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,560
while my husband Christopher
was at our home in London,

89
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,680
I took the National Express coach
number 450

90
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,960
from London to Mansfield
and visited my parents..."'

91
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,520
That was the route number then. It might
be different now, the way these things go.

92
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,240
Erm, "I... I took the National
Express coach number 450

93
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,160
from London to Mansfield and visited
my parents at their home.

94
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,240
All I'm prepared to say
is that, firstly,

95
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,720
I am not responsible for the death
of my father William Wycherley.

96
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,840
I believe my mother
Patricia Wycherley shot him.

97
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,120
I will say that I did, in fact,
shoot and fatally injure my mother,

98
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,360
but only after severe provocation.

99
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,920
I was in a very fragile
state of mind at the time.

100
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,440
I would like to make it
absolutely clear that my husband

101
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Christopher Edwards had nothing
to do with the deaths of my parents.

102
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,080
He was only made aware
of their deaths by me

103
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,320
one week after the incident."

104
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,000
Signed and dated.

105
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,160
As I've said, it's my handwriting
but it's my client's words.

106
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,920
Thank you, Mr Hylton.
Susan, ARE these your words?

107
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,320
Does that reading accurately reflect
the content of your statement?

108
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,200
No comment.

109
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,800
OK, Susan.
If I go to the end of the statement.

110
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
- This your signature?
- No comment.

111
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,800
- It's OK, Susan, you can answer.
- Oh, sorry. Yes, that's my signature.

112
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,440
That's all right, Susan.
Your statement's very helpful.

113
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,880
So, tell me, when you say
you went to visit your parents,

114
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,440
- what was their address in Mansfield?
- 5 Braxton Close.

115
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,000
And at that time,
you were 39, just about to turn 40?

116
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,800
Yes.
"No comment."

117
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,920
Erm, again I must stress to you,
that although it's completely...

118
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,880
your decision, my advice remains

119
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,000
that you answer all questions,
"No comment."

120
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,280
- No comment.
- I can see you're confused, Susan.

121
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,160
Your solicitor and I
are coming from different angles.

122
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,960
But I'm just trying to establish
some extremely basic facts.

123
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,280
So, if you want to, you can answer.

124
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,760
Right?

125
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,600
You say Christopher Edwards
is your husband. When did you marry?

126
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,840
No comment.

127
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,800
Can I ask why you're smiling?

128
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,920
Well... no comment.

129
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,840
Whoa.

130
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,560
We've uncovered some slightly dodgy
financial activity,

131
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,360
which Sandra's looking into,

132
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,040
and apparently they were friends
with Gerard Depardieu...

133
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,800
whatever the fuck
that has to do with anything.

134
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,240
- Oh, hello again.
- You done?

135
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,040
Yes. Thank you. I-I'm sorry.
Breakfast isn't really my thing.

136
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,320
But my... my compliments
to the chef, though,

137
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,280
or whoever it is that prepares
the microwave packages.

138
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,960
Cos scrambled eggs, they're not
easy to do in bulk, are they?

139
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,120
- They often go hard, don't they?
- You still going with that?

140
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,680
Oh! Er, no, all done. Thank you.

141
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,520
It was great.
It wasn't what I expected.

142
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,160
- Oh, really?
- No.

143
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,160
- Apres vous.
- Merci.

144
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,480
Me, too!

145
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,320
How is it so late?
I've missed the last train!

146
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,000
- Well, get a bus. Or I'll help you with a taxi...
- It's already so late!

147
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,880
What's the panic?
It's not the end of the world.

148
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,920
I know it's silly!
But we have... we have this routine.

149
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,320
We usually have a cup of hot chocolate
together at bedtime and talk about the day.

150
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
We've done it since I was little.
It's story time.

151
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,680
Only, I didn't tell him or Mum
that I was gonna be late.

152
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,000
So they'll be waiting up,
wanting to go to bed.

153
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,920
- Just phone them.
- If they're sleeping, I'll wake them up.

154
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,040
OK. How about this?
If you want...

155
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,120
If it's easier for your parents,
I mean,

156
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,680
you can stay at mine tonight.
I mean, I'm not...

157
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,240
No, er... no funny business.

158
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,360
But... I've got me mum staying.
She's on the sofa.

159
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,440
A bit of a long story but er...

160
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,080
But, anyway, I'll sleep
on the floor. You can have my room.

161
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,520
- Oh, I couldn't make you do that.
- No, honestly. I'd be happy to.

162
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,280
And in the morning,
I can help you get home.

163
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,240
Oh, Chris.

164
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,760
'Just to confirm
one more time,

165
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,120
Chris, you are content for this interview
to continue without a solicitor?'

166
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
'I am content.'

167
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,040
I don't need someone
who knows nothing about me

168
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,280
telling me when, and when not,
to speak.

169
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,280
Right, you understand you can change
your mind on that at any time?

170
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,440
So, I've been told.

171
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,280
In fact,
people won't stop telling me.

172
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,480
Right. Thank you.

173
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,280
I can't say I didn't know.

174
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,880
Right, Mr Edwards.

175
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,920
Before we begin
with specific questions,

176
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,760
is there anything you would
like to tell us from the outset,

177
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,000
anything about
why you think you're here?

178
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,360
Yes, I would. Thank you. Ah...

179
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,920
The following is an account
of the events as I recall them.

180
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,840
On a bank holiday weekend
in May, 1998,

181
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,040
my wife Susan Edwards took a coach
from London to visit her parents,

182
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,520
William and Patricia Wycherley,
in Mansfield.

183
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,320
I myself remained at home in London.

184
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,360
Now, I went with my wife
to Mansfield...

185
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,120
the following weekend

186
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,560
and only then
learned of the tragic events

187
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,560
that had transpired
the previous weekend,

188
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,320
ie, the death of her parents.

189
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
I wanted to ring the police,
of course,

190
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,440
but my wife can be very fragile

191
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,000
and she convinced me
that nobody would understand

192
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,960
the complexity of what had happened

193
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and why she was not at fault.

194
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,480
That's when we er...

195
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,080
when we did what families
traditionally used to do...

196
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,720
still do in many parts of the world,
in fact, which is to inter them,

197
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,400
uh, respectfully,
in their own home dwelling.

198
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,120
Or domicile, if you will.

199
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,360
'I mean the thing that's really
tortured me all these years

200
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,600
is had I been with her
on that previous, fateful weekend,

201
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,400
none of this would have happened,
you can be sure of that,

202
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,440
and we wouldn't be sitting here
right now, you gentlemen and I, no.'

203
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,560
'Right, one last question.

204
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,680
Do you happen to recall
the coach company

205
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,680
you and Susan took up to Mansfield?'

206
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,400
'National Express.

207
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,720
Route four-five-O, as it was then.

208
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,480
It might have changed now,
the way these things go.'

209
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,160
'All right, well, I think
we've covered the crux of it,

210
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,560
so erm... we'll take a break there
and pick things up later,

211
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,520
if you don't mind, Mr Edwards.'
'Happy to oblige.'

212
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,880
"Happy to oblige" with the same
bollocks wifey's peddling!

213
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,000
Only difference is
she's got a solicitor.

214
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,320
Yeah, but they've given us
a confession, haven't they?

215
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,120
- Of sorts.
- Er, "Dear Christophaire,

216
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,200
- it was a big mistake to tell your stepmuzzaire about ze-"
- Shut it, Gerard!

217
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,520
What do you reckon they'd get
if we take it, sir?

218
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,640
Not enough. Financial stuff aside,
whatever fraud they've committed...

219
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,800
Oh, yeah, worth doing again,

220
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,600
it went so well
the first fucking time

221
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,840
That's Susan up on loss of control
manslaughter for shooting her mum.

222
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,000
Assuming that "severe provocation"
business holds up.

223
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
So, what, five years?

224
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,820
Eight at most.

225
00:16:56,845 --> 00:16:59,040
- And Chris is only gettin' a year or two if that.
- For what?

226
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,600
Interfering with the duties of a
coroner or some vanilla crap.

227
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,600
Which is not bad if they've
actually committed double murder.

228
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,400
Maybe not such idiots after all.

229
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,920
That story won't hold up in court,
though, will it?

230
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,440
Bullet wounds like that.

231
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,600
It's one shooter,
just a question of who.

232
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,360
- I reckon we press him on that...
- Sir?

233
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,800
I wonder if we could try something?

234
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,400
- Mess with their heads a bit.
- Go on.

235
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,240
Could I handle both interviews, sir?

236
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,880
You've got big bollocks today,
don't you, Lancing?

237
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,560
This is your statement, Susan,
now labelled as item EL-06.

238
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,560
We're glad to have it,
but it doesn't begin to explain

239
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,600
how your parents wound up dead
and buried in the garden, does it?

240
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,560
Do you have a question
for my client?

241
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,400
Dozens. How did you first learn
your mother shot your father, Susan?

242
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,400
- Where were you?
- No comment.

243
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,640
- Was it daytime or night-time?
- No comment.

244
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,240
What about the gun? Whose was it?

245
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,840
- Had you seen it before?
- No comment.

246
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,840
- What did you do with it afterwards?
- No comment.

247
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,760
- What did you do with the bodies?
- No comment.

248
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,600
Did you wrap them in duvets,
put them under the bed?

249
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,520
No comment.

250
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,960
Did you make a phone call
around 2:00am?

251
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,240
Perhaps to your husband,
Christopher?

252
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,920
Is... Is Chris talking?
What about his solicitor?

253
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,040
- No, "No comment."
- You said he wouldn't talk!

254
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,400
Your husband's opted not to take
legal advice, Mrs Edwards.

255
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,480
- Have you told him it's free?
- He knows it's free.

256
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,600
It's just he's chosen
to be cooperative.

257
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,760
He's told my colleagues
everything he can, Susan.

258
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,240
Which makes me look a bit silly,
to be honest.

259
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,320
I'm meant to be the smart one, but
it's Bill and Ben in the other room

260
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,440
getting all the juicy stuff
from your very charming husband.

261
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,120
Only, he wasn't there,
was he, Susan, that night?

262
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,240
So, we're inclined to think
he might be making it all up.

263
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,000
You do want us to know the truth,
don't you?

264
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,480
- My advice remains...
- You said he wouldn't talk!

265
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,680
Now he's doing one thing, I'm doing
another, and we're not together.

266
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,280
- I'm sorry.
- It's actually... it... it's quite...

267
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,480
erm, strange.
Does Chris know anything...

268
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,120
Chris is very clever man.
You don't have to worry about that.

269
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,000
- Perhaps you'd like to take a...
- No, I would not!

270
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,920
- 'OK, Susan, can we go back to the beginning?'
- 'Yes, of course.'

271
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,400
'Thank you. Let's break it down
one step at a time.'

272
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,160
Big balls.

273
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,880
Er, do you want me
to leave you alone for a bit?

274
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,280
Or I can show you
where to get some fresh air...

275
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,440
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

276
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,720
OK.

277
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,520
You're doing really well.

278
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,800
Am I?

279
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,920
Yeah. Er, definitely.
Just... stay strong.

280
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,400
Try not to take the bait.

281
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,080
OK.

282
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,560
It's October 31st, 2013.
The time is 13:31.

283
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,120
Interview with Christopher Edwards.

284
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,240
Hello, Mr Edwards.
How are you today?

285
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,320
Never better. May I ask what
happened to the other two officers?

286
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,880
Something more important than this,
apparently.

287
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,640
Very rude, if you ask me.
But, anyway...

288
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,840
And thank you for providing
such a thorough account

289
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,880
of the awful events of May 1998.

290
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,440
It's a very sad story, Mr Edwards.

291
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,800
It is. Yes I'm... very happy to help.

292
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,078
Would you mind if we
just review a few things?

293
00:20:41,103 --> 00:20:42,840
Not at all,
Detective Constable.

294
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,280
Susan was up with her parents
in Mansfield.

295
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,320
You're at home in London,
in Dagenham.

296
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,400
She rings you up
in the middle of the night.

297
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,120
You answer. What does she say?

298
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,920
Nothing, really. She couldn't
tell me anything. She was too upset.

299
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,280
'Upset about what?'

300
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,640
I need you, Chris.
It's all wrong without you.

301
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,520
'Well, she'd had a terrible night.

302
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,880
Her mother was drunk,
her father abusive.

303
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,360
The usual story, I'm sad to say.'

304
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,400
I can't wait to get back...
to London.

305
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,560
'And the next time you see her,
you say, is the following Tuesday?

306
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,400
- After the bank holiday Monday.'
- 'Indeed.'

307
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,880
- 'At Victoria Coach Station.'
- 'That's right.'

308
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,600
'You say she'd not told you anything
about what had happened,

309
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,520
but was there anything that struck
you as unusual about her? Her mood?'

310
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,040
'Yes, she was odd... quiet.

311
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,680
She said er...

312
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,520
What was it? Something like...'

313
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,000
It was the most awful weekend,
Chris. Really dreadful.

314
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,840
I need a drink.

315
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,080
'Which was very unusual.

316
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,040
She almost never drinks.

317
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,600
I remember she asked
for a port and brandy.'

318
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,640
Port and brandy?

319
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,440
Er, yes. Port and brandy.
For the nerves.

320
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,800
Shot of brandy,
shot and a half of port.

321
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,960
Right.

322
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,080
OK. Port and brandy.
And what did you have to drink?

323
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,920
Erm... well, I didn't want a drink.

324
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,600
I had a cup of tea. Earl Grey.

325
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,960
So, you go up to the house
the next weekend...

326
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,160
week after Susan first went up,

327
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,400
she having said nothing
that whole week,

328
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,760
- about having killed her parents.
- About her mother killing her father.

329
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,880
- About her killing her mother, then.
- She was provoked.

330
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,000
- Provoked. So you say.
- So, SHE says.

331
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
So you both say. Very neat.

332
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,040
Look...

333
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,800
I'm not gonna sit here and pretend

334
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,280
I don't know it's a defence...
provocation.

335
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,200
"Loss of control" you call it now,
I believe.

336
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,640
Reducing murder to manslaughter.

337
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,720
- You've done your homework!
- It's good I have.

338
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,640
You've just arrested my wife
for murder,

339
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,320
whereas in truth
all she's ever done is suffer.

340
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,760
And I don't think anyone should
go to prison for that, do you?

341
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,040
And as for that night, no, no,
she couldn't have shot them both,

342
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,280
because she couldn't have done
anything to hurt her father.

343
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,360
I know her.
I know her better than you.

344
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,560
He had too much power over her.

345
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,480
Trouble is, it looks to us
like your in-laws

346
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,200
were both shot from a similar angle,
perhaps by the same person.

347
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,880
Well, I don't know anything about
that, but Susan didn't lie to me.

348
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,600
OK. Let's get back to you, then,
Mr Edwards.

349
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,440
That following Friday, you both
take the coach up to Mansfield.

350
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,240
That is correct. The Friday,
right after I finished work.

351
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,920
- And she still hasn't told you?
- I'm getting to that.

352
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,880
It wasn't until we arrived
at the house.

353
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,000
First, we picked up fish and chips.

354
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,520
We always have fish and chips
on Fridays.

355
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,880
It's just when I'm tucking in that
Susan starts to act a bit different

356
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,840
and suddenly she says
something like...

357
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,480
I can't stand it any more.
They haven't gone away. They're upstairs.

358
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,600
And I'm,
"What are they doing upstairs?

359
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,720
Why don't they come down
and say hello?"

360
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,240
Something like that.

361
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,080
And then I don't remember
the exact words

362
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,600
- but then she says something like...
- Because they're dead.

363
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,640
And I'm, you know...

364
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,160
"What do you mean?"

365
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,160
It's a surreal... disbelief thing.

366
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,400
I lose all interest
in my haddock and chips.

367
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,760
And I love haddock and chips.
It's my favourite.

368
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,200
A big deal, then?

369
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,720
Well, I've not had a single bite
of haddock since that day.

370
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,040
- Strictly cod.
- Isn't there a smell?

371
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,360
What? Ah, you mean a fish smell?

372
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,880
It was warm that week. We checked.

373
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,240
Yeah, but it was night
when we ate our fish and chips.

374
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,120
The point is that the bodies
would've been lying there for days.

375
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,240
Forgive the unpleasant image,
they're your in-laws after all...

376
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,480
but there would've been
quite a stench.

377
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,000
Ah. I er... Yes, well, I know.

378
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,680
That's one of the er...
But, no, I didn't smell it.

379
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,960
But Susan... Susan said...

380
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,160
Or, well, later I think she said

381
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,120
that there had been an awful smell.

382
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:23,160
But, no, I didn't...
notice it at the time... myself.

383
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,400
Hard to explain, really.

384
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,080
Except, of course,
that the house always smelt

385
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,240
overwhelmingly of cigarettes
because of her parents.

386
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,400
Sandra!

387
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,880
Sandra!

388
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,280
There you are.
You're looking for me?

389
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,180
Oh. Yes, sir. Sorry.

390
00:25:58,205 --> 00:26:00,160
Why you apologising? I hear
you've found something good.

391
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,760
Just make it quick.
We're in the middle of interviews.

392
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,720
I spent the morning
at the branch in town.

393
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,640
- In the archive room.
- Oh, bank archives.

394
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,360
- The glamour never stops, does it?
- Yeah! It won't stop. Um...

395
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,920
- But, yeah, so...
- Excuse me.

396
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,600
Er, this is a bank statement
for a joint account.

397
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,480
Susan Edwards
and Patricia Wycherley.

398
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,280
Right. And if you look over here...

399
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,400
that's the date
the account was opened.

400
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,280
This is good, Sandra.
This is very good. Come with me.

401
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,920
Come here! Fuck's sake!
I'm not gonna eat ya'!

402
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,800
'First of all, Susan, I'd like to
introduce you to Officer Sandra Winters.'

403
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,920
Hello.

404
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,280
Officer Winters is a member of
our Forensic Financial Department.

405
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,840
Oh, my husband's an accountant!

406
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,440
Can you look at this bank document,
please? Police Item CKA-04, Sandra.

407
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,080
Do you recognise that?

408
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,324
That's a bank account
statement showing the joint

409
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:53,440
account you opened in
your name and your mum's.

410
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,000
Can you read the date there, please?
Left-hand side.

411
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,560
5th of May.
5th of May, 1998.

412
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,040
So, talk me through it.

413
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,760
You kill your mother.
Your father's dead as well.

414
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,320
You dispose of the gun and then
first thing Tuesday morning,

415
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,280
after the bank holiday,
9:17am to be specific...

416
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,440
you transfer a bank account
into you and your mother's names

417
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,080
and withdraw almost half the funds.

418
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,720
- In cash.
- In cash.

419
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,680
Yes, I... I... can't remember.

420
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,960
You don't need to remember.
It's all there in the document.

421
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,840
Well, yes, as I say,
she's been er...

422
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,440
Sometimes she's simply
economical with the truth.

423
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,080
We all are sometimes.

424
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,480
But this... This is difficult.

425
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,440
It's straight after the killings.
It's obscene. It's mercenary.

426
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,160
And, to be honest with you,
it's a little bit daft.

427
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,800
- Well, I think she was obviously very...
- It's not confusion, Chris, is it?

428
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,960
Bang, bang, open a bank account.

429
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,840
Well, yes, I...

430
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,840
You said the word, I suppose.

431
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,120
Mercenary. But...

432
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,080
Is there something
you're not telling us, Chris?

433
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,640
Something that could help Susan?

434
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,720
Because at the moment, this doesn't
paint a very pretty picture, does it?

435
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,640
It's...

436
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,120
It's a very personal matter.

437
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,080
Personal?

438
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,920
I'll tell you what's personal.

439
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,760
Being shot in your own house,
kept under the bed for a week

440
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,360
and buried in your own backyard
for 15 years.

441
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,200
I'd like it on record
that I don't think it's very fair

442
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,000
what I've just said about Susan,
or rather what you said.

443
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,520
It does her a grave disservice
to call her "mercenary".

444
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,200
Why?

445
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,640
Because Susan has always had...

446
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,600
..much bigger things to worry about
than money.

447
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,920
Right. Clean sheets on yesterday,
in case you're wondering.

448
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,200
Here's a towel. Toothbrush.

449
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,640
Thank you.
Are you sure this is all right?

450
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,960
Yeah, of course, yeah.
Yeah, it's my pleasure.

451
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,440
Is your mum OK?

452
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,640
Yeah, she's fine.

453
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,960
She's er...

454
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,320
She's not very well at the moment.

455
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,880
Well, I had a very good time
with you tonight, Susan.

456
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,040
Me, too.

457
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,040
Have a good sleep
and I'll see you in the morning.

458
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,920
- Good night.
- Good night, Chris.

459
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,040
You OK for coffee?

460
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,880
Everything's good, Mum. Thanks.
It's very nice.

461
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,480
Eggs aren't her strong suit.

462
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,080
It was so nice of her
to cook for us.

463
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,800
Oh...

464
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,840
I'm sorry. I really should go.

465
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,440
All right.

466
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,120
- Thank you.
- All right, then?

467
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,000
Both done?

468
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,640
Oop! Oh, silly me.

469
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,200
You going already, Susan?

470
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,880
I'm sorry. I've had a lovely time.
Thank you for your hospitality.

471
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,160
And you're walking her back.

472
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,600
Lovely. Chivalry lives!

473
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,960
Separate rooms and everything.

474
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,640
Christopher, I know I embarrass you.

475
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,360
But I was right about
the dating agency, wasn't I, hmm?

476
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,040
It was my idea.
Might even give it a go myself.

477
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,480
It was very nice to meet you.

478
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,240
You too, Susan.

479
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,000
And hopefully,
we'll be seeing each other again.

480
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,720
OK.

481
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,080
Look, maybe we should
just say goodbye here.

482
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,920
Oh.

483
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,160
- All right, then. Goodbye.
- Bye.

484
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,280
- Bye.
- Bye.

485
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,600
You've met MY mother!

486
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,720
- You're embarrassed of me!
- They're just old-fashioned!

487
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,680
Maybe next time!

488
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,760
Can you let me in?

489
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,000
Mum?

490
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,920
Dad, please, can you let me in?
I can explain.

491
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,680
Sorry to keep you waiting, Susan.
I know it's been a long day already.

492
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,480
What we need now are your words
on exactly what happened that night.

493
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,800
Chris can't really tell us,
because er...

494
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,880
according to you both,
he wasn't there.

495
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,320
Only you were there.

496
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,920
Now, you say that your mother
shot your father.

497
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,040
That's not something
that happens every day, is it?

498
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,560
So the obvious question... is why?

499
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,560
- No comment.
- Oh.

500
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,000
I thought you were feeling a bit
more comfortable talking to us.

501
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,200
What happened, Susan?

502
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,070
Was there an argument or
disagreement between them?

503
00:35:24,095 --> 00:35:25,080
No comment.

504
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,640
What did you feel when you saw your
father there, dead on the floor?

505
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,600
Your mother having shot him.

506
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,480
- I felt terrible.
- Terrible.

507
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,240
That's a normal reaction, Susan.

508
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,440
- But what do you do with that emotion?
- No comment.

509
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,480
- Do you confront your mother?
- No comment.

510
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,240
What's she say to you?
These questions have to be answered.

511
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,400
They DON'T have to be answered.
That's not true.

512
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,080
But this is a horrible event,
isn't it?

513
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,480
- Two people shot dead. Your own parents.
- This is what I mean by bait.

514
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,720
But it's not a full explanation
to say you're simply "provoked".

515
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,200
People are gonna provide
their own answers if you don't.

516
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,640
- You don't have to say anything.
- No comment.

517
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,200
The bank account you opened
the day after the killings, Susan.

518
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,720
The pensions you collected,
the sale of the house,

519
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,400
all those debts you had to cover.

520
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,120
That feels like a slightly better
explanation, doesn't it...

521
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,880
to someone who wasn't there,
that this really was about money?

522
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,240
After all, you'd not
seen your parents for over a year,

523
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,280
you say, and then suddenly
you pay them a visit.

524
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,120
- And then they die.
- But it wasn't, as I said...

525
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,720
We've just been with your husband.

526
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,400
Do you know what word he used
to describe your behaviour

527
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,000
with that bank account?

528
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,680
Mercenary.

529
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,440
And, I'm sorry, but I'm inclined
to think a jury would agree.

530
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,400
He wouldn't say that.

531
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,360
- It might be useful for my client...
- It's on tape, Susan.

532
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,720
Chris told us
something else as well, Susan,

533
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,840
that I'd like to ask you about
if you're comfortable with it.

534
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,040
He said that your mother
told you something that night

535
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,400
that you didn't know.

536
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,000
What did your mother
tell you that night?

537
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,720
She said um...

538
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
She said um...

539
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,040
Sorry.

540
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,520
Must have been very hard
for him to tell you that.

541
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,320
- Can I just... I'm sorry...
- It's OK, sir, I'll explain.

542
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,120
I know how hard it is.

543
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,080
- But it'll be better for...
- I just said, I'll explain it.

544
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,320
Even while I was sleeping,
I was aware of shouting,

545
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,120
some sort of row.

546
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,000
But that was nothing unusual
in that household, not at all.

547
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,520
And as I told you,
I had been drinking a little...

548
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,600
a little more than normal.
I... I don't normally drink.

549
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,080
'I don't know what time it is.
Maybe 2:00am.

550
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,840
And I've been woken by these bangs.'

551
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,160
- 'How many bangs?'
- 'Er... I dunno. I was asleep.

552
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,400
Two, maybe? Or just one.
Definitely not three.'

553
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,400
- 'One or two?'
- 'Yes.'

554
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,040
And I know immediately
that my father's dead.

555
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,760
I don't know how I know,
I just know.

556
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,480
And my mum is standing there
with a gun.

557
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,080
There are brass casings
on the floor.

558
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,960
- Brass casings?
- Yeah, erm, spent bullets, I suppose.

559
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,760
And I can tell she's even more drunk

560
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,280
than she was when I went to bed.

561
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,960
Then I say something like, "What
have you done? You've killed him!"

562
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,880
Something like that.
It was a long time ago.

563
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,720
And she says,
I can't give you the exact words,

564
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,240
- but she says something like...
- I had to.

565
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,160
I can't take it any more, Susan!
I couldn't look at him.

566
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,720
Something along those lines.
And then she turns on me

567
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,000
and she's actually waving the gun
at me at this point...

568
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,320
God knows why you care, after
everything you've been through,

569
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,320
grubby little man.

570
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,360
Horrible, horrible man.

571
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,640
What a disgusting
piece of work he was.

572
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,040
And then she throws the gun on the bed
somewhere about here, so I pick it up.

573
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,640
He treated me
as though he was disgusted with me.

574
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,560
- Er, sorry, Susan.
- Yes?

575
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,480
Why'd you pick up the gun?

576
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,720
Er, it's just, well,
she'd been waving it at me

577
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,120
and she was drunk
and I suppose I was afraid

578
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,040
that she was gonna
pick it up again.

579
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,400
Erm, so anyway, and then she starts
saying that thing.

580
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,840
I hated him.

581
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,440
For years, I hated him.

582
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,440
And I hate you too.

583
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,480
Cos when I look at you,
I know I failed.

584
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,680
I failed you, Susan,
and I know that.

585
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,680
I know what he did to you.

586
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,960
I knew it and I just let it happen.

587
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,440
How do you think I feel about that?

588
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,440
- You knew, Mum? You knew?
- Look, of course, I fucking knew.

589
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,280
I'm your mother, aren't I?!

590
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,680
He didn't even want me after that!
He couldn't do it.

591
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,320
He couldn't even get it up!

592
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,480
I've spent 15 years
trying to forget what she said

593
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,960
so I can't tell you exactly,
but it was something like that.

594
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,640
Oh, I'm sorry.

595
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,560
I am so sorry, Susan.

596
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,360
I'm not a monster.

597
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,520
I did my best.

598
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,160
We had some good times together,
didn't we?

599
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,120
Even though
you were a difficult child.

600
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,360
All I could think of was,
"I want to call my husband."

601
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,320
I even said, "We should call Christopher.
He'd know what to do."

602
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,400
Give up, Susan.

603
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,320
You think he's different
but he's not.

604
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,880
He's not gonna help you.

605
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,960
He's the same as all the others.
He's just using you for the sex.

606
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,040
No, Mum! And then I keep crying
and she keeps saying these things.

607
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,880
He doesn't love you!
Just accept it before you get hurt.

608
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,080
- Nobody loves you!
- Stop! Please stop!

609
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,760
God knows I tried
but it's impossible.

610
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,320
- You're impossible to love!
- Stop it, Mum! Stop it!

611
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,532
With your miserable
little life, it would be

612
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,824
better for all of us if
you'd never been born!

613
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,840
I just want to confirm the
implications of what you're saying.

614
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,560
Are you telling us that your father
abused you as a child?

615
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,040
- Yes.
- Sexually?

616
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,360
Yes.

617
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,440
And that night you discovered that
your mother had known all along?

618
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,400
- Yes.
- And you'd never told her?

619
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,160
I was always too afraid
of what my father might do.

620
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,040
I spent my whole life
just trying to wish it away.

621
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,920
Thinking of all those years after
school when she was at work and he...

622
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,760
And Chris, your husband.

623
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,400
Are you sure
he wasn't involved in the killings?

624
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,840
I only ask because the bullet holes
on your parents' chests

625
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,360
were strikingly similar.

626
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,480
And that bank account,
that looks like a plan.

627
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:29,360
With all this new information today,
some of which is quite important,

628
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,200
as my colleague is pointing out,

629
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,080
we will be applying for extra
custody time so we can continue.

630
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:39,040
So, we're just trying to get everything
as clear as possible before we progress.

631
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,440
Er, I think she's been
pretty clear already, don't you?

632
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,680
Are you sure Chris wasn't involved?

633
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,400
He helped you, didn't he?

634
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,880
He decided to protect you.

635
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,880
Susan?

636
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,400
Course, he did.
He always protects me.

637
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,720
Did he bury the bodies for you?

638
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,520
Yes, he buried the bodies.

639
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,200
He's very practical like that.

640
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,760
He has to be, cos I'm not, you see.
So, he has to be.

641
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,520
- Ah, Susan, if you wanted a break...
- We couldn't tell the police.

642
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,360
He understood that
so he took control.

643
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,200
And so... this was his idea, then...

644
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,240
to bury the bodies?

645
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,160
Yes, it was his idea.

646
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,680
He did that for me.

647
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,600
He's the only person in the world
that's ever made me feel safe.

648
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,440
We'll get it sorted.

649
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,240
He's not allowed to keep you
out of your own house.

650
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,200
Has he always been like that?

651
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,680
It's OK. You don't have to tell me.

652
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,160
No, I...

653
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,240
I do want to tell you.

654
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,880
What is it?

655
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,480
It's just I've...

656
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,760
I've never told anyone else.

657
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,680
Well, whatever it is...

658
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,760
...it'll be between us.

659
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,680
Just you... and me.

660
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,320
'Susan Edwards had been
at her parents' house

661
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,400
when she was woken by a loud bang.'

662
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,760
'She'd gone into
her parents' bedroom.'

663
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,280
'Her mother had shot her father.'

664
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,200
'Susan Edwards claimed
an argument then took place,

665
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,920
during which her mother told her she knew
her father had abused her as a child.'

666
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,160
- 'Susan Edwards admits manslaughter.'
- 'Manslaughter.''Manslaughter.'

667
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,652
'She says, killing
her mother...'

668
00:45:01,677 --> 00:45:03,640
- '...she was provoked...'
- 'Provoked.'

669
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,840
- 'Provoked.'
- '...into shooting her.'

670
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,320
'The Edwards claim they returned
to the house a week later

671
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,480
and had sat down
to eat fish and chips

672
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,240
and watch the Eurovision
Song Contest on television

673
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,240
when Susan Edwards suddenly
blurted out, "They're upstairs."

674
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,240
Christopher Edwards said
he went upstairs

675
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,400
to find the Wycherleys dead,
underneath the bed.

676
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,120
'...before then dragging
the two dead bodies down the stairs

677
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,000
and burying them here
in the garden.'

678
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,480
'But prosecutors say
it was all a lie.

679
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,440
They claim the Edwards jointly
planned to kill the Wycherleys.'

680
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,400
'Over the years, the Edwards emptied
the elderly couple's bank accounts.'

681
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,400
'Both she and Christopher Edwards
admit burying the bodies and theft.

682
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,840
But both of them deny murder.'
