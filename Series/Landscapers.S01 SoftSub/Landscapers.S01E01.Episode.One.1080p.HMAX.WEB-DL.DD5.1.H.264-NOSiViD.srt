1
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:56,791
Left stage!

2
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,666
Action! Rain.

3
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:13,708
Market Square, action!

4
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,166
Action!

5
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,750
- Uh-huh.

6
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,916
- Ah... Shit.

7
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:34,458
- Ah.

8
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:35,833
Uh... Hello? Douglas speaking.

9
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,541
<i>Oh, hello. It's Susan Edwards.</i>

10
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,250
<i>I understand you're being</i>
<i>offered as-- as my, um...</i>

11
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,083
Yes, that's right.
My name is Douglas Hylton.

12
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,166
I'll be coming in to help you
tonight, Mrs. Edwards.

13
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,500
SUSAN:<i> Oh, Susan's fine.</i>

14
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,291
Oh. Okay, thanks. Um...

15
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,708
Well, if you'd like,
I'll be representing you

16
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,291
- for the foreseeable--
- SUSAN:<i> Oh, good, because...</i>

17
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,208
<i>you've heard, I think,</i>
<i>that my husband and I</i>

18
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,916
<i>have got ourselves</i>
<i>into a bit of a pickle.</i>

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,041
<i>- I know it sounds all rather...</i>
- Susan. Susan?

20
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,500
<i>- ...morbid--</i>
- Uh-- Sorry to interrupt you,

21
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,791
and thank you for calling me,
but I'm actually, uh,

22
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:04,083
walking to you right now,
so if that could just wait
for a minute.

23
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,333
SUSAN:<i> Yeah, I mean,</i>
<i>obviously we regret... I mean--</i>

24
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:09,416
<i>I mean, we should have done</i>
<i>certain things differently.</i>

25
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,708
<i>I-- I think we're both happy</i>
<i>to admit that.</i>

26
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,625
Well, "ha--" "happy"
is hardly the word, is it?

27
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,708
<i> So-- So--</i>

28
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,875
<i>So, I can hear you've got a lot</i>
<i>to get off your chest,</i>

29
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,166
<i>but, um, really,</i>

30
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,333
<i>- it's, uh...</i>
- It is just very complicated,
Douglas,

31
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,166
and I'm very keen for--

32
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,958
But it's my husband,
really, Chris, he just...

33
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,791
- he shouldn't be here.
<i>- Sus-- Susan? Susan?</i>

34
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,875
<i>- Sorry, can I just--</i>
- So I feel, for his sake,

35
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,458
everyone should know the truth
from the outset.

36
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,333
<i>- Uh... Uh-- Uh-- Susan?</i>
- Yes?

37
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,833
<i>It-- It's-- It's-- It's just...</i>
<i>This isn't a private call</i>

38
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,000
<i>because I'm not actually</i>
<i>your representative yet.</i>

39
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,666
<i>Uh... That's what I'm coming</i>
<i>to do now,</i>

40
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,083
<i>you see,</i>
<i>to take your instruction,</i>

41
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,541
<i>and then I can...</i>

42
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,000
<i>- Does that make sense?</i>
- I see, yes.

43
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,625
- Sorry. Silly old me.

44
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,125
<i>- Look, I-- I can sense</i>
<i>we're gonna get on, Susan.</i>

45
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,333
<i>- I'll speak to you very soon.</i>
- Thank you.

46
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,541
- Sorry to keep you.

47
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,083
- FRANCOIS:<i> Bonjour, Madame.</i>
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

48
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,333
Ah...

49
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,833
Of course,
but I think you mentioned

50
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,500
this one.
He's one of your favorites.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,916
- Gary Cooper.
- Oh...

52
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:07,041
It's an original,
from the second Belgian release.

53
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,291
- The second Belgian release?
- Mm-hmm.

54
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,791
Aside from everything else.

55
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,458
For you, madame,
I'll make a special price.

56
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,666
- Two hundred fifty.
- Oh, no, um,

57
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,916
- Francois, it's too much. Sorry.
- How about 200?

58
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,958
I could possibly stretch
to 100, but...

59
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:30,791
Madame...
...for you, I'll make it 150,

60
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,541
'cause I know
this will make you happy

61
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:36,208
- and that makes me happy too.

62
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,083
Okay.

63
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:48,750
Uh-- If you use the card,
it must be 170, madame.

64
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,708
Oh, okay.

65
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,500
- SUSAN:<i> Merci.</i>
<i>- Merci beaucoup.</i>

66
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,541
Mm-hmm.

67
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,166
<i>- Salut, mon cher.</i>

68
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,750
- Hello, darling.
- Mm-hmm.

69
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,333
That's a nice greeting.

70
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:22,291
- Good morning?
- Um... It's okay, I think.

71
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,916
- Lovely.

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,541
- I've made sandwiches.
- Thank you.

73
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,166
And there's soup
from last night if you want it.

74
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh.

75
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,291
- CHRISTOPHER EDWARDS:
What's in the sarnies?

76
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,583
Tuna and sweetcorn
on normal bread.

77
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,750
Found some
in the English section

78
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,916
- at the Monoprix.
- Oh, lovely.

79
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:47,625
Yes. Yes, yes. I felt I made...

80
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,583
a good impression.
Oh, and my French

81
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,750
- is really improving, actually.
- Ah!

82
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,625
- Drink?
- Yes, please.

83
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,416
So, I've got another one
this afternoon

84
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,000
which I'm hoping
will go even better. Mmm.

85
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,375
Oh, yes. Look, Chris!

86
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,833
It's just like the one
I had on my bedroom wall

87
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,083
- as a little girl...

88
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,875
...that my grandfather
brought me.

89
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,000
It wasn't in French, but look!

90
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,333
Same image.

91
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,416
- How much was it?
- Oh, it was nothing.

92
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,250
Twenty euros?
It's not an original.

93
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,916
You know, Susan,
even 20 euros,

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,208
there'll be a final demand
for the gas in there,

95
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,666
and I'm the one
who's gotta open them

96
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,000
and sort it out.

97
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,625
- Is that from Gérard?
- You open it.

98
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,583
Well, no,
it's-- it's for you.

99
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,166
Hmm.

100
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,916
My God. A hundred euro.

101
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,916
See, crosspatch? Didn't I say?

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,916
Things around here
are about to change.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,541
Well, it's only a hundred,
Susan.

104
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,625
- But it's a start, isn't it?
- Of what?

105
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,875
We're way behind on the rent,
and if I don't get a job--

106
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,291
But you will get a job.
That's what I mean.

107
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:19,583
Yes, well, I'm trying...
trying my hardest.

108
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,375
Come on, then. What's Gérard
got to say for himself?

109
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,291
Read it out loud. I'm listening.

110
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,708
I'll look at it later.

111
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,625
Susan?

112
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,375
Why don't you, uh...

113
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,958
Why don't you put
that thing up?

114
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,916
Silly, keeping it hidden away
now you've got it.

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,916
Yes. Good idea.

116
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,416
Who wouldn't give
this handsome man a job, hey?

117
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,875
We'll celebrate afterwards
in the café.

118
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,708
Christopher Edwards?

119
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,208
<i>Vous pouvez répéter la question?</i>

120
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,208
<i>S'il vous plaît.</i>

121
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,583
Go on, Chris.
You can do it.

122
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,708
Mon cher,<i> Chris.</i>

123
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,000
<i>Please find enclosed 100 euros,</i>

124
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:15,458
<i>a small token of my gratitude</i>
<i>for your eternal friendship.</i>

125
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,750
<i>As you will know from my movie,</i>
<i>we have a saying in France,</i>

126
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,916
"La vie en rose."

127
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,333
<i>The meaning of this phrase</i>

128
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,291
<i>is to look up at the stars</i>
<i>instead of in the gutter,</i>

129
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,583
<i>to see the beauty</i>
<i>that exists in life,</i>

130
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,541
<i>even when</i>
<i>it is difficult to find...</i>

131
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,750
<i>perhaps sometimes</i>
<i>even when it is not there.</i>

132
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:41,708
<i>This is the purpose of stories</i>
<i>and the purpose of cinema,</i>

133
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:45,833
<i>but more than this,</i>
<i>it is the purpose of love,</i>

134
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:50,333
<i>and to be loved is the most</i>
<i>beautiful thing in the world.</i>

135
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,958
<i>Yours sincerely,</i>
<i>Gérard Depardieu.</i>

136
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,625
- CHRISTOPHER:<i> Hello?</i>

137
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,416
- TABITHA EDWARDS:<i> Hello?</i>
- CHRISTOPHER:<i> Is that Tabitha?</i>

138
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,291
TABITHA:<i> Speaking. Who's that?</i>

139
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,708
TABITHA:<i> That's not you,</i>
<i>is it Chris?</i>

140
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,500
- Yeah. It's me.
- TABITHA:<i> Chris?</i>

141
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,250
Yes.

142
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,708
Uh... Um...

143
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,208
Listen, I'm sorry
it's been so long.

144
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,708
- TABITHA:<i> Where are you?</i>
- Uh... I'm-- I'm in France.

145
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,500
- TABITHA:<i> Are you with Susan?</i>
- Yeah.

146
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,666
I've just-- I've just been
for a-- a-- a-- a job interview,

147
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,875
actually.

148
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah, a-- a fairly senior
credit control position.

149
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,083
You know, but the truth is,
what with the, um...

150
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,416
the, um, the language barrier,

151
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,625
um... we-- we're in a bit
of financial, um...

152
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,666
you know-- Uh...
What am I saying?

153
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,583
There's--
There's this cashflow situation,

154
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,750
um, and believe me, we-- we--
we-- we're very grateful

155
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:17,125
for all the help
you've given us in the past.

156
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,750
- TABITHA:<i> Chris?</i>
- Oh, um...

157
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,041
- TABITHA:<i> Is everything okay?</i>
- No, I'm sorry. I'm still here.

158
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,250
Yeah, um...

159
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:31,208
Uh...
It's just, I need you to...

160
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,166
promise me something,
Tabitha. Um...

161
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,625
You see, I've-- I've-- I've done
something rather silly...

162
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,958
and it might sound bad,

163
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:44,791
might sound very bad, even,
but it's not what it seems.

164
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,208
Not at all.
It's not what it seems,

165
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,458
and, um, just needs a little bit
of clearing up, that's all.

166
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:54,333
So... that's why I need you
to promise me.

167
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,625
I need you to promise me

168
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,791
that you won't tell the police.

169
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,333
There you go. Can you
promise me that, Tabitha?

170
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,500
Uh... Because I can't...

171
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:12,291
I can't let Susan down.

172
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,791
Do you understand?

173
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,958
She's...

174
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,708
She's very, uh, fragile, yes.

175
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,333
TABITHA:<i> Just tell me</i>
<i>what you need, Christopher.</i>

176
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,708
<i>I'm always here for you,</i>
<i>you know that.</i>

177
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,375
SUSAN:<i> So, how was it?</i>

178
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,541
Yes.

179
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,958
It's, uh...

180
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,791
- Yes. Hard to tell, isn't it?
- Yeah. But good, do you think?

181
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,625
Uh... Well, my head's
a bit, um...

182
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,458
- but yes.
- Oh, I knew it.

183
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,958
- Do you want a coffee?
- Yeah.

184
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,333
Okay.

185
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,708
<i>Oh, excusez-moi.</i>

186
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,541
<i>- Merci.</i>

187
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,416
Yeah, I was actually just, uh...

188
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:16,666
I was just thinking.
Supposing I do get this job...

189
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,958
I mean, I still wouldn't be paid
for a few weeks, would I?

190
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:24,208
We're behind on the rent.
And it--

191
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,708
it's not like other times,
Susan.

192
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,083
We're... We could be in...

193
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,916
<i>- Merci.</i>
- Thank you.<i> Merci.</i>

194
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,416
We could be in trouble.

195
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,708
So...

196
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,750
I was thinking, maybe,
to take the pressure off,

197
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,375
we could try
to borrow some money.

198
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,916
You know, I could ask

199
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,291
my stepmother, Tabitha.
She's, uh...

200
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,416
You think?
She's family, isn't she?

201
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,541
No.

202
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,416
- Really? I mean, would you--
- But no one knows

203
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,833
where we are or why.

204
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,416
And you'd possibly have to tell,

205
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,541
wouldn't you?
You'd have to explain a little

206
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,125
why we're here, and then,

207
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,916
- she could tell the police,
couldn't she?

208
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,833
- Not we've done
anything wrong.
- The police?

209
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,666
Why would she do that?
I don't think there's any danger
of her doing that.

210
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,583
- She's family.
- No, Chris.

211
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,916
Look, we're doing fine.

212
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,750
We're just going through a bit
of a sticky patch, that's all.

213
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:32,291
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

214
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,583
Forget I mentioned it.
It's a silly idea.

215
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,166
- Silly.

216
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,708
OPERATOR:<i> Thank you for calling</i>
<i>Nottinghamshire Police.</i>

217
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,000
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>after the tone.</i>

218
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,750
My name
is Doctor Tabitha Edwards.

219
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,166
I'm calling to report
something rather...

220
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,625
Well, I don't know
what to make of it, frankly.

221
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,958
<i>My stepson just told me</i>
<i>over the telephone...</i>

222
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,833
<i>...that he buried</i>
<i>his wife's parents</i>

223
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,416
<i>in a garden near Nottingham</i>
<i>fifteen years ago.</i>

224
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,625
<i>So, I'm just curious to know</i>

225
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,500
<i>if there were</i>
<i>any reports of a couple</i>

226
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:23,083
<i>by the name of William</i>
<i>and Patricia Wycherley</i>

227
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,208
<i>going missing around that time?</i>

228
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,375
- EMMA LANCING:<i> Sir?</i>
- TONY COLLIER:<i> No.</i>

229
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,583
- Sir?
- Go away!

230
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,625
Fuck off, Emma.
I'm having my lunch.

231
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,041
Have you got a minute, sir?

232
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,208
We've just received a tip.
There are two bodies buried

233
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,583
in a back garden
in a house in Mansfield.

234
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,083
Woman called Tabitha Edwards...

235
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,500
- was informed yesterday...

236
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,208
...by her stepson, Christopher.

237
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,375
- When?
- Fifteen years ago.

238
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,250
Fifteen years? Fuck off.

239
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,125
Stop telling me
to fuck off please, sir.

240
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,416
Bloody hell.
Why is this so fucking hot?

241
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,208
- Well, it's a flask, sir.

242
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,666
Fucking Mount Etna, that is.
Ridiculous.

243
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,166
- Can't feel my fucking mouth.
- It's his in-laws
apparently, sir.

244
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,416
- His what?
- The bodies.

245
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,000
Says he didn't
actually kill them.

246
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,583
Says it was an accident.

247
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,000
Rang to ask his stepmom
for some money

248
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,458
- and then he just sort of
spilled the beans.
- Right.

249
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,208
- Does he know that we know?
- She's made him aware, yeah.

250
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,583
Just, um, sent him
an email, apparently.

251
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,250
Sent an email?

252
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,750
What? "Dear Christopher,
I've told the fucking police"?

253
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:30,208
I told her
in strict confidence!

254
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,750
I asked her not to tell anyone.

255
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,958
I'm as disappointed as you are.
I'm...

256
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,125
I'm-- I'm disgusted, actually.

257
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,083
Darling, she wasn't gonna
send any money

258
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,583
unless I told her
what was going on

259
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,958
and why we needed it.
Put yourself in my shoes.

260
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,208
What was I supposed to do?
We'll be living on the streets,

261
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,458
eating croissants
out of rubbish bins next!

262
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,916
Is that what you want?

263
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,541
We'd still be together though,
wouldn't we?

264
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,583
It's okay.

265
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,833
Just have to move again.

266
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,791
- Susan--
- No!

267
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,250
You were supposed
to protect me!

268
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:55,541
I have protected you!
I am. I'm trying!

269
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,000
But we both knew
this day would come.

270
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,541
But it's not your decision,
Chris! There are two of us here!

271
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,416
We're in this together,
aren't we?

272
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:05,958
Aren't we?

273
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,291
Yes.

274
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,875
And now, after all this time,
I'd do it for you.

275
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,208
I'd live on the streets for you.
I'd eat rubbish for you!

276
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,958
I'd eat a croissant
out of a bin for you.

277
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:18,000
- Well, we're not
quite there yet.
- But I would, though!

278
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,166
Yeah.

279
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,791
Let's get this
cleared up, shall we?

280
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,375
Then how about a film?

281
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,250
Would you like to watch a film?

282
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,625
Yeah,
that's it there, number seven.

283
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,000
It's not number seven,
mate. It's number five.

284
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,666
Oh, right.

285
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,416
That's the house
over there.

286
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:04,958
So, shall we park up

287
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,541
- over there, then?
- Yeah. All right, all right.

288
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,916
I'm on it, I'm on it.

289
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,000
Just don't make
a scene.

290
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,458
Why would I make
a scene?

291
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,750
Because you're a twat.

292
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,541
- You're a twat.

293
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,500
Why are you doing that?
I just rang the bell.

294
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,250
Can you stand a bit further
away from me, please?

295
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,625
What you on about?
I'm not even standing that-- Oh!

296
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,500
- Afternoon.
- Good afternoon, sir.

297
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,708
Sorry to bother you.
We're from Nottingham Police.

298
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:32,833
We're following up a report
of a historic crime in the area

299
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,000
and, uh, wonder if we could have
a quick chat.

300
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:38,208
- Oh, right. Um...
- If that's not too much trouble.

301
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,958
No, sure. Uh...

302
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:42,375
Come in. I've got my youngest
asleep upstairs, though,

303
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,708
if you don't mind creeping.

304
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,083
All right, no problem.

305
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,583
- Perhaps we could go
through to the garden?
- Yeah, sure.

306
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,666
Yes, assuming
you've got a garden.

307
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,291
You what?

308
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:54,916
Yeah.

309
00:22:58,458 --> 00:22:59,500
Twat.

310
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:03,416
How long you've been here,
if you don't mind me asking?

311
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,625
Going on eight years.

312
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,000
Nice neighborhood?

313
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:09,208
Yeah, it's nice enough.

314
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,916
Pretty quiet, to be honest
with you,

315
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,458
but, uh, well, we like it.

316
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:16,625
Do you know who lived
here before, by any chance?

317
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:20,000
A elderly couple, apparently.
I'd have to check the, um...

318
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,250
- Wycherley?
- Huh?

319
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,416
- Was it, uh...

320
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,416
...William and Patricia
Wycherley, by any chance?

321
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,250
Yeah, rings a bell. Um...

322
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:32,750
Why? Is this about them?

323
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,875
It wasn't me.

324
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,625
Whatever it is
you're investigating, officers,

325
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,041
it wasn't me.

326
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,333
Hello, there.

327
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:45,250
That's, uh--
That's Nigel.

328
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,416
He likes to talk to us
through the hedge.

329
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,625
All right, Nige?

330
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:50,500
Well, I should be happy
to move to the gap

331
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,333
if that's preferable, officers.

332
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:55,208
There's a gap just down there.
Shall we do that?

333
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:08,583
This is what I mean by a gap.

334
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:11,958
It's quite handy
for talking across gardens.

335
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:14,583
What's on the barbie
today, then, Nige?

336
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,125
Been having quite a few,
so I've noticed.

337
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,291
Well, you're always
welcome to join us, Danny,

338
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,583
you know that.

339
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:25,375
Briony! There's a couple
of police officers here

340
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:28,583
asking poor Danny some questions
about the Wycherleys.

341
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,708
Could you bring out
some more bangers?

342
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:32,250
I think it'd be fair to say

343
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,458
they were slightly
peculiar neighbors.

344
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,958
Although we didn't see a great
deal of them, did we, Bri?

345
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,041
No, not much.

346
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,250
- We heard them mostly.
- Yeah.

347
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,125
- Playing that strange organ.
- Oh!

348
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:43,583
Morning, afternoon, evening.

349
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,750
Apart from that, they kept
themselves to themselves.

350
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:46,833
Hmm.

351
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:49,791
Do you need more ketchup,
officer? It's homemade.

352
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:52,166
Mm. No. I'm good thanks.
These are...

353
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,083
These are really nice.
Thank you. Hmm.

354
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:56,166
So, you can hear
quite well then, can you?

355
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,250
Your neighbors.

356
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,791
Oh, very well.
You can hear everything.

357
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:03,250
Anything untoward or unusual
while the Wycherleys were here?

358
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:06,250
Ah, it's just the normal
sort of bickering, I suppose.

359
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,083
Occasional rows.

360
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:11,000
Oh, they were quite
funny together, mind.

361
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:14,791
You see, on the rare occasion
that you'd see them out,

362
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:17,000
on the way to the shops,
for example,

363
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:22,000
Patricia would walk two
or three yards behind William.

364
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:26,666
A sort of Victorian thing,
like she was his chattel.

365
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,916
So, I-- I-- I don't know
if that could be used as a...

366
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,875
clue of some kind.

367
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:37,458
I'll bear that in mind,
thank you.

368
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:41,375
Do you know what came of them?
When they left, where they went?

369
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,875
Blackpool then Ireland's
what we heard. Yeah.

370
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,291
- For the air.
- Yeah. Yeah.

371
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,958
- Big smokers, both of them.
- Left their daughter

372
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:49,875
and their son-in-law
to look after the place.

373
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:53,458
- Son-in-law mainly, Chris. Uh...
- And, um,

374
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:55,583
when would the Wycherleys
have gone to Blackpool?

375
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:58,458
- Oh, let's see,
what, ten?
- Fift...

376
00:25:58,541 --> 00:25:59,958
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen. Fifteen years ago.

377
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:02,541
- Hmm.
- Yeah, well before
they actually sold the place.

378
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:04,666
It were Christopher
who told us they'd gone.

379
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,958
He were the only one we'd chat
with from time to time.

380
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:08,750
Yeah, when they were
doing the garden.

381
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,583
- What?
- What about the...

382
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:16,500
- Oh!

383
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:19,000
Uh-- Yeah, yeah,
another funny thing, actually.

384
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,791
There was a morning,
about that time,

385
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:23,375
when I woke up early,
as I sometimes do,

386
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,625
and I looked out my window,

387
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:30,833
and I saw Chris digging a hole
in the Wycherleys' garden.

388
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:33,291
Quite a deep hole.
Very deep, in fact.

389
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,833
Now, he was probably just
planting those rhododendrons

390
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:38,041
that you'd seen round
at Danny's but, uh,

391
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,500
we joked about it, didn't we?

392
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,708
'Cause we said he's probably
burying his in-laws.

393
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:45,833
Because it was about that time
that they'd, uh, moved away.

394
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:49,125
So, I don't know
if that could be used as a...

395
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,625
some kind of clue?

396
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,291
- Let him through.
Let him through.
- Go on, you go out.

397
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:05,875
- Keep going.
- Edward, on your scooter.

398
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,125
Go through. Yeah.

399
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,500
Hold on. Edward,
hold on, wait for your sister.

400
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,041
Dear, Mr. Edwards,

401
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:20,166
please forgive
my contacting you directly...

402
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,125
but your stepmother,
Dr. Tabitha Edwards,

403
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,541
has been kind enough
to pass along

404
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:25,166
your email address.

405
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,708
She indicated you may be
in possession

406
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:29,166
of some information
of possible interest to us

407
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,875
<i>and if you'd be good enough</i>
<i>to share your telephone number,</i>

408
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,166
<i>we'd very much like</i>
<i>to speak with you</i>

409
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,208
<i>at your earliest convenience.</i>

410
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:37,625
Even better would be
the opportunity

411
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:39,833
to arrange
for a personal interview,

412
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:41,541
although Dr. Edwards informs us

413
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:44,333
that you may
currently be residing abroad.

414
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:46,583
I want to reassure you that
in that event,

415
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:48,625
we don't believe
it's in anyone's interests

416
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,625
to trouble
the local authorities.

417
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:53,791
<i>Yours truly,</i>
<i>Detective Chief Inspector</i>
<i>Tony Collier.</i>

418
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:00,541
<i>Why are you stopping?</i>

419
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:02,666
It's no good.
I've got to go back, Amy.

420
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,875
Why?

421
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:06,291
This is crazy.
I haven't even got any guns.

422
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:08,000
<i>Then let's go on. Hurry.</i>

423
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:10,000
- <i> No.</i>

424
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:11,000
<i>They're making me run.</i>

425
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:13,125
<i>I've never run</i>
<i>from anybody before.</i>

426

THOMAS MITCHELL:
There's gonna be fighting

427
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:29,958
when Kane and Miller meet.

428
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,750
<i>- And somebody's gonna get hurt.</i>

429
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:34,041
<i>- That's for sure.</i>

430
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:43,458
- ACTOR 1:<i> Everything ready?</i>
- ACTOR 2:<i> Sure, just the way</i>
<i>you want it, Frank.</i>

431
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:45,958
ACTOR 3:<i> Yeah, we've got</i>
<i>your gun over here.</i>

432
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:47,708
ACTOR 1:<i> Let's get started,</i>
<i>then.</i>

433
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,500
- CHRISTOPHER:<i> Dear DCI Collier.</i>

434
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:09,750
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for your considerate message.</i>

435
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:12,291
<i>My wife Susan and I</i>
<i>would be delighted</i>

436
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,333
<i>to assist you</i>
<i>in any way we can...</i>

437
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:15,833
- CHRISTOPHER:
<i>...and to put this</i>

438
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:18,291
<i>whole matter behind us</i>
<i>once and for all.</i>

439
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:20,666
<i>We agree that it's</i>
<i>in everyone's interests</i>

440
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,166
<i>to avoid involving</i>
<i>the French police.</i>

441
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,666
<i>I'm afraid, however,</i>
<i>that our return to England</i>

442
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,583
<i>may not happen as soon</i>
<i>as you might prefer.</i>

443
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:30,833
- Good afternoon.

444
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:32,583
How many leads do you have
besides the garden?

445
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:35,166
CHRISTOPHER:<i> I'm sure that you</i>
<i>understand that my first duty</i>

446
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,541
<i>is to my wife.</i>

447
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:38,666
She is of a very fragile
disposition

448
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,208
and we have been leading
a peaceful...

449
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,750
existence here in France.

450
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:45,875
I'd be worried about inflicting
unnecessary stress

451
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:49,000
and it could take her some time
to come round to the idea

452
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,958
<i>of leaving this country</i>
<i>to return to the UK.</i>

453
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:55,166
- CHRISTOPHER:<i> Nevertheless,</i>
<i>do let's stay in touch.</i>

454
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,833
<i>We look forward</i>
<i>to the opportunity</i>

455
00:29:56,916 --> 00:29:59,625
<i>to clear our names</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

456
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:02,000
<i>You have my word.</i>

457
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:04,541
<i>Yours very sincerely,</i>

458
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:07,291
<i>Christopher Edwards.</i>

459
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:39,541
COLLIER:<i> In answer</i>
<i>to the question</i>
<i>on everyone's mind,</i>

460
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:41,083
- I can confirm that...

461
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,291
...yesterday morning,
two bodies were found buried

462
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,500
in the back garden
of a house in Mansfield.

463
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:51,125
At present, we cannot confirm
the identities of the deceased,

464
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:53,208
nor do we know
the cause of death

465
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:55,916
or the circumstances under which
they came to be buried

466
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,583
in that location.

467
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,541
That being said,
we do have some leads

468
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:02,333
and we hope to be making
significant progress

469
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:04,708
- over the coming days.

470
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:07,541
LANCING:<i> "Do let's keep</i>
<i>in touch." I'm sorry,</i>
<i>but what is that?</i>

471
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:09,208
Psychopath.
Written all over it.

472
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:10,416
Why can't we just get
a warrant,

473
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,375
have the French track them down
and pick them up

474
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:13,666
before they get away?

475
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,208
What we arresting them for,
Emma? Writing a weird email?

476
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,166
Prevention of a lawful
and decent burial?

477
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,375
Double murder?

478
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:21,791
Hey! Good one!

479
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,583
Let's go and arrest them,
then, shall we? Off we pop!

480
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:26,083
Oh, hang on a minute.

481
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:28,083
Where the fuck
did the murders take place?

482
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:31,125
When the fuck? Who the fuck
was involved? How the fuck?

483
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:32,625
European Arrest Warrant.

484
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:35,125
Because, thank you, Paul...

485
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:37,250
that's what we need
for a European Arrest Warrant,

486
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:38,375
minimum.

487
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:40,166
So, they can just stay there
as long as they like?

488
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,208
Yes. He's thick
as two short planks

489
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:43,916
- and he knows that.
- Cheers, mate.

490
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,916
At the minute, all we've got
are those bullets,

491
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,791
a nutty professor
who got a dodgy phone call

492
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:50,875
from some bloke in Lille,
a pair of rickety old skeletons

493
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:53,125
in a back yard,
buried God knows when,

494
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:55,000
and a vague proclamation
of innocence

495
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,666
from a man who writes
very polite emails

496
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,208
to the police.

497
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:01,333
So, either we come up
with some hard evidence

498
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:03,416
or Croque Madame
and her pen-pal Muppet husband

499
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,250
can carry on
with their French bloody holiday

500
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,416
for as long
as they damn well please.

501
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:13,291
I'll see you in ten minutes.
I'm getting a fucking sandwich.

<i>of this "fragile" business then?</i>

503
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:24,208
"She's of a very
fragile disposition."

504
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:26,958
He's just saying whatever comes
into his head, isn't he?

505
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:28,208
To fuck with us.

506
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:30,250
I hate that.

507
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,625
Fragile people.

508
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,625
All right.

509
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:38,666
We've got nothing
to go on, do we?

510
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,041
She might not even
be that fragile.

511
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:46,791
But he didn't need to tell
his stepmom

512
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,916
that he'd buried those bodies
in the garden, did he?

513
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,375
He's answering questions
no one's even asked.

514
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:55,916
And they're not even
his parents,

515
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,458
so what's he doing burying them
in the fucking garden?

516
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:00,000
If...

517
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:01,416
If he did bury them.

518
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:03,791
I don't know.

519
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,208
‘Cause they're heavy?

520
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:08,416
Oh, it can't just be that.

521
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,500
I've got tits, I could dig
a fucking hole if I had to.

522
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,458
"Fragile."

523
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,833
I know what fragile
fucking means.

524
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,125
It means you're in charge.

525
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:25,208
You're the one who gets drunk
and ends up in hospital.

526
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:27,416
You're the one who gets sad
and lashes out.

527
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,541
You're the pain in the arse,
basically.

528
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,708
My, um...

529
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:44,500
My mom always says
about relationships

530
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:48,666
that one of you is the gardener
and the other one's the garden.

531
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,083
Right.

532
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:57,708
What does that mean?

533
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:01,750
Don't know.

534
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,958
I fucking hate gardening.

535
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,500
<i>What happened here is unknown,</i>

536
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,291
<i>but over 13 years ago,</i>

537
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:19,166
<i>two bodies were buried</i>
<i>in this garden.</i>

538
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,291
<i>Only discovered</i>
<i>by police on Thursday,</i>

539
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:24,291
<i>officers were led to the house</i>

540
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:26,750
<i>after receiving information</i>
<i>last week</i>

541
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:31,083
<i>about an alleged incident</i>
<i>in the late 1990s.</i>

542
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:33,250
<i>Our enquiries have confirmed</i>

543
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:36,208
<i>that in 1998, an elderly couple,</i>

544
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:38,916
<i>named William</i>
<i>and Patricia Wycherley,</i>

545
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,750
<i>resided at the address</i>
<i>in question.</i>

546
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,541
<i>We have, of course,</i>
<i>been in contact</i>

547
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,375
<i>with former neighbors</i>
<i>and relatives</i>

548
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,666
<i>of the Wycherleys,</i>

549
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,750
<i>and they've painted a picture</i>
<i>of a quiet couple</i>

550
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:52,166
<i>who kept themselves</i>
<i>to their selves,</i>

551
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,458
<i>and who appeared to have</i>

552
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:56,666
<i>very few close friends</i>
<i>or assoc--</i>

553
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,250
I didn't finish that crossword.

554
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,250
Oh, well.

555
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:09,125
We can have another look
at it later.

556
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:13,416
I've pressed
your suit for you.

557
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:18,458
Thank you.

558
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:21,500
In case you get
a second interview for that job.

559
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:25,791
I won't get a second interview.
It's been a week.

560
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,750
Now, why would you say that?
Why would you give up?

561
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:30,916
Because it was
a terrible interview!

562
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:34,666
They've all been terrible.

563
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:38,166
It was a waste of time,
and it was humiliating.

564
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,875
Have the... police replied
to your message?

565
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:51,000
No, they haven't.
And to tell you the truth...

566
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:56,458
I just think
that the more we run,

567
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:58,250
the more guilty we'll seem.

568
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,958
They won't believe us.

569
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:06,541
I'm going for a shower.

570
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:20,416
Forensics confirms that one
of the bodies is male,

571
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,166
the other is female.

572
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,541
We recovered
two .38-caliber bullets

573
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:28,291
from each of the wrappings
around the body.

574
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:32,083
Looks most likely that both
were shot twice in the chest

575
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,458
using the same weapon.

576
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:36,750
Obviously, we are yet to hear
any more from the Edwardses,

577
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:40,166
but I think it's fair to say
that whoever killed these people

578
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,208
probably killed them on purpose.

579
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:49,750
Bon appétit.

580
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,375
- Thank you.

581
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,083
- Mmm.

582
00:38:58,166 --> 00:39:00,708
Mmm.

583
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:12,666
Sorry, Chris.

584
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:19,291
- Wh-- What's the matter?
- I'm so sorry.

585
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:24,458
- It's all my fault.
- Hey.

586
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:30,041
- No, it's not, Susan.
- It is.

587
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:32,875
It's not your fault.
Don't you ever think that.

588
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:35,166
I've ruined your life.

589
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,500
- Oh!

590
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,000
You haven't ruined my life.

591
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:44,125
- How can you say such a thing?

592
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:48,416
- Because...
- You are my life.

593
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:52,333
You're my whole life.
You know that.

594
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:00,541
- Come on, now.

595
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:03,416
- Everything's gonna be just...

596
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,916
- fine.

597
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:09,166
Everything
is gonna be all right.

598
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:11,875
Okay, baby?

599
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:14,791
I promise.

600
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:25,416
CHRISTOPHER:<i> Dear DCI Collier,</i>

601
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,791
<i>we note the growing notoriety</i>
<i>of your inquest</i>

602
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:32,208
<i>and possible assumptions</i>
<i>about our involvement.</i>

603
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:34,125
<i>We have, therefore,</i>
<i>decided to return</i>

604
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:36,125
<i>to England immediately.</i>

605
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:37,416
<i>We prefer this approach</i>

606
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,250
<i>rather than to leave ourselves</i>
<i>open to a surprise arrest,</i>

607
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:44,125
<i>since my wife is already</i>
<i>sufficiently frightened.</i>

608
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:46,750
- Sorry to interrupt, but,

609
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:49,500
uh, this just came in
from Christopher Edwards, sir.

610
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:53,958
- You, get me London.

611
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:56,000
- Yes, sir.

612
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:58,750
- You, get me the
British Transport Police, ASAP.
- Yeah, on it, sir.

613
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:02,708
- Emma, where the fuck are ya?

614
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:04,000
Later this evening,

615
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:07,958
my wife and I
will board the Eurostar

616
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:10,166
and surrender ourselves
to the authorities

617
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,416
- at St. Pancras Station.

618
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,500
We do have
one small favor to ask.

619
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:18,583
<i>Since same-day tickets</i>
<i>are so pricey,</i>

620
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:20,125
<i>and we find ourselves</i>

621
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:22,000
<i>a bit short of funds</i>
<i>at the moment,</i>

622
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:24,791
<i>could you be so kind</i>
<i>as to arrange tickets for us</i>

623
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:28,666
<i>on the 23.34 departure</i>
<i>from Lille?</i>

624
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,166
<i>We should then arrive shortly</i>
<i>before midnight</i>

625
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:34,000
<i>- if there are no delays.</i>

626
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:38,500
CHRISTOPHER:<i> Yours sincerely,</i>
<i>Christopher Edwards.</i>

627
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:42,166
Tickets booked, sir.
Coach five, seats 61 and 62.

628
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,708
Brilliant. Get in the back.

629
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:45,791
- What?
- I'm not getting in the fucking
back. Are you joking?

630
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:51,208
- Sorry, can you just
bear with for a sec?
- Come on. Fuck's sake.

631
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:53,958
- Back door lock might be on.
- Can you let me in?

632
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:55,833
- It's a child lock or summat.
- Fuck's sake.

633
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:59,208
- The country's finest
spring into action.
- Fucking hell. Right.

634
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:01,041
- Yeah, what were you saying?
- Buckle up. Come on.

635
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:04,041
I do beg your pardon,
we just needed
to sort something else out.

636
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:41,875
Come on, love.

637
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:47,416
Susan, we really need
to get that train.

638
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:50,625
Please?

639
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:14,208
It's not so bad
now we're on our way, is it?

640
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:17,791
Feel quite calm, actually.

641
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,625
You know, I think
it's a good thing
that you spoke to Tabitha

642
00:45:22,708 --> 00:45:25,041
and that she told the police.

643
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:26,791
It's about time they knew,
isn't it?

644
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:28,416
- Hmm.
- They ought to know.

645
00:45:30,416 --> 00:45:32,125
And what have we got
to worry about?

646
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:34,083
We know what happened.

647
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:35,958
We just have to stick
to the plan and tell them.

648
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:38,666
Don't we? Like we've been
saying, stick to the plan.

649
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,000
That's right, darling.
Stick to the plan.

650
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:45,416
How much money have you got?

651
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:47,916
- Not much.
- How much?

652
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:49,958
About...

653
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:54,000
two euros something.

654
00:45:56,375 --> 00:45:58,750
I've got one and a bit.
Hand it over.

655
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:02,000
Might as well use it up!

656
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:12,000
COLLIER:<i> Do you know</i>
<i>what I find weird, though?</i>

657
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:14,208
<i>It's those long scotch eggs.</i>
<i>Do you know the ones</i>

658
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:15,500
that you get
at service stations?

659
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:17,958
Oh, my God, yeah.
It's all powdered, isn't it?

660
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,583
First time I saw it, I was like,

661
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:21,375
"Show me the chicken
that laid that egg."

662
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:23,125
- Do you know what I mean?

663
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:27,500
- Did you say something, Emma?
- What?

664
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:29,541
No, just saying about

665
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:31,458
those long scotch eggs.

666
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:33,500
- Service stations.

667
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,416
Like, "Show me the chicken
that laid that."

668
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:38,541
- 'Cause it's a weird egg.
- Yeah.

669
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:40,416
Fuck's sake. Is this thing on?

670
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:57,166
Hey.

671
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,666
Guess who I thought
I just saw in the buffet car.

672
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,125
- Who?
- Gérard.

673
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:04,875
- Depardieu?
- Yeah, Gérard Depardieu.

674
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:06,500
He was heading over
from business class

675
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:08,583
and I thought,
"Oh, my goodness, that's him!"

676
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:11,250
But it wasn't?

677
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:13,750
No. Can't have been, can it?

678
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,875
No, it's just someone
who looked like him.

679
00:48:54,416 --> 00:48:56,166
PATRICIA WYCHERLEY:
<i> ...fucking saying.</i>

680
00:48:56,250 --> 00:49:01,208
<i>I am just spending a few seconds</i>
<i>alone with my own daughter.</i>

681
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:04,791
<i>What do you need?</i>
<i>Just get down the staircase.</i>

682
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,333
<i>Go on, just get up</i>
<i>to your bedroom!</i>

683
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:15,291
Oh, Chris.

684
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:18,708
CHRISTOPHER:

685
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:21,291
It's all right.

686
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,333
I'm stronger than I look.

687
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,250
Chris, I don't think
I can say goodbye to you.

688
00:49:30,541 --> 00:49:32,833
No one is saying goodbye,
my love.

689
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:37,125
There are no goodbyes
between us.

690
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:42,125
I'll never leave you.
You know that.

691
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:46,666
Never.

692
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:53,458
Give me your passport.

693
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,250
Are you ready, darling?

694
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,833
Suppose so.

695
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:23,333
- DCI Collier,
Nottingham Police.
- Sir.

696
00:50:23,416 --> 00:50:25,041
I'm the SIO.

697
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:38,208
ANNOUNCER:<i> The next train</i>
<i>to arrive at platform 11</i>

698
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:40,833
<i>will be the 23.34...</i>

699
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:42,541
- Right, I'll take
up here.
<i>- ...Eurostar service</i>

700
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:45,291
<i>- from Lille.</i>
- I'll go up and round.

701
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,041
ANNOUNCER:<i> The next train</i>
<i>to arrive at plat...</i>

702
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:57,958
You got eyes on them, Paul?
Over.

703
00:50:58,041 --> 00:51:00,166
SUSAN:<i> Where did they say</i>
<i>to meet them?</i>

704
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,291
By the south-west...

705
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:05,208
exit of the St. Pancras Hotel
car park,

706
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:06,958
which I think is this way.

707
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:08,083
COLLIER ON RADIO:
<i>Paul, come in.</i>

708
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:09,875
<i>Have you got eyes on them? Over.</i>

709
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:12,500
Not yet, sir,
but eyes peeled. Over.

710
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:20,000
Sorry. Excuse me.
Terribly sorry.

711
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:29,166
I think I might
have spotted them, sir.

712
00:51:30,166 --> 00:51:31,791
What are they doing?

713
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:34,541
They're just sort
of walking, sir.

714
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:37,541
In your direction. Over.

715
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:40,666
Remember,
one step at a time...

716
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:41,833
...like we said.

717
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:44,708
They arrest us,
they read us our rights.

718
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:46,708
We know what we're gonna say.
We've gone through it

719
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:48,625
a thousand times
and we're ready.

720
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:50,625
But don't say a word
without a solicitor.

721
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:51,958
- Right?
- Yes.

722
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:55,875
And remember, if you don't like
the first one they offer,

723
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:58,625
ask to meet another.
You're in charge.

724
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:01,458
Then come the police interviews.

725
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:03,458
They'll try to confuse you,
but don't let them.

726
00:52:03,541 --> 00:52:07,166
Just tell our story,
simply and calmly.

727
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:10,833
No need to make anything up.
Just tell them the truth.

728
00:52:10,916 --> 00:52:13,041
Yes, just tell them the truth.

729
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:35,291
Good evening.

730
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:44,500
REPORTER 1:<i> Susan</i>
<i>and Christopher Edwards</i>

731
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:46,875
<i>might have seemed</i>
<i>like an ordinary couple,</i>

732
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:49,750
<i>but together, they had carried</i>
<i>a sinister secret</i>

733
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,708
