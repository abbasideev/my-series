1
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,520
'It's just - I need you to...

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,720
promise me something, Tabitha erm...

3
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,760
You see, I've...
I've done something rather silly.

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,640
And it might sound bad -
might sound very bad even -

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,120
but it's not what it seems.

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,000
Not at all.
It's not what it seems

7
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,920
and um...just needs a little bit
of clearing up, that's all, so...

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,520
That's why I need you to promise me.

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,960
I need you to promise me
that you won't tell the police.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,560
There you go.
Can you promise me that, Tabitha?

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,680
Er, because I can't...

12
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,680
I can't let Susan down.
Do you understand?

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,760
She's very, er, fragile. Yeah.'

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,440
'(VEHICLE ENGINE REVVING)'

15
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,800
'Dear Chris...

16
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,320
I've managed to get hold
of a pen and some paper

17
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,640
and so I thought
I'd write you a letter.

18
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,400
There's so much
I want to say to you, Chris,

19
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,880
and maybe, one day,
we'll see each other again

20
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,000
and I'll be able to do it.

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,200
Perhaps a little better
than I feel able to now.

22
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,520
You see, I never cared about being
shut out from the real world...

23
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,200
..because I never felt like
I was allowed to arrive here
in the first place.

24
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,040
I'm not here, anyway, am I?

25
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,680
So, what's the difference?

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,160
What's the difference between here
and somewhere else in my head?

27
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,520
But I see it now.
That it was different for you.

28
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,760
You had a place in that world...
and then you met me.

29
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,720
So, I just wanted to say
that I understand.

30
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,200
I will love you always...
but I understand.

31
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,680
Yours, Susan.'

32
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,960
Wait there.
I'll be back in minute.

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,520
What? Chris. Where are you going?
I'll be back before you know it.
Just hold tight.

34
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,520
..and buried them in
the rear garden of their own house.

35
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,920
They then set about concealing
both the deaths and the burials

36
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,680
for the next 15 years.

37
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,200
But the story that Susan
and Christopher have concocted

38
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,040
is a fantasy.

39
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,360
It is not the truth.

40
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,560
Over the course of this trial,
we will demonstrate
that Susan and Christopher Edwards

41
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,840
are not only audacious
and unrepentant liars,

42
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,120
they are cold-blooded killers
who, with forethought and malice,

43
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,800
jointly agreed to murder
and conceal the bodies

44
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,240
of the helpless Patricia
and William Wycherley.

45
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,120
Thank you.

46
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,440
Good morning, officers.

47
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,240
My step-son left this letter
on my porch early this morning.

48
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,880
'Decomposition begins
almost immediately...

49
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,720
and after three or four days
in a warm environment, the corpse

50
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,000
enters a new phase of decay which we
refer to as putrefaction or bloat.'

51
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,160
The microorganisms
digesting body tissue produce gases

52
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,560
which cause the body to swell -
most visibly in the face,

53
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,880
where the eyes and tongue are pushed
forward, often quite grotesquely.

54
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,120
And these gases
are extremely foul-smelling.

55
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,280
We've all had the misfortune
of smelling "off" chicken.

56
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,200
Now imagine two chickens,
each the size of a human body.

57
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,400
'In many cases,
it induces nausea and vomiting.'

58
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,320
So what are the chances,
would you say,

59
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,560
of Christopher and Susan Edwards
entering a tiny house,

60
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,400
where two adult corpses had lain
for nearly a week

61
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,760
in temperatures
of up to 23 degrees Celsius,

62
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,360
and not immediately smelling them?

63
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,800
Nil.

64
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
Yah!

65
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,320
Dr Dickson,
in the Edwards' interviews,

66
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,760
they repeatedly stated
that William Wycherley's limbs
and torso were "stiff".

67
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,160
What would account for that?
Rigor mortis.

68
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,320
Biochemical changes in a dead body

69
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,240
that lead to a stiffening
of the muscles.

70
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,920
Is rigor mortis permanent?

71
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,760
No. Without refrigeration,
it dissipates

72
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,320
approximately three days
after death.

73
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,880
So, could William Wycherley's body
have been stiff

74
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,960
six days after he was killed?

75
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,760
It is highly improbable.

76
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,120
Yet, both Chris and Susan
contend that it was stiff

77
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,880
when they buried it.

78
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,120
Their timescale must be mistaken.

79
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,280
They must have buried William
within three days of death.

80
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,560
When Mr Edwards maintains
he was still in London?

81
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,480
Yes.

82
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,760
Here.

83
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,000
Whoa. Whoa.

84
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,520
With a double-action revolver
like this...

85
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,040
the trigger action has two phases.

86
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,080
The first part of your squeeze,
which takes quite a bit of effort.

87
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,040
I think you can see
the strain on my finger.

88
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,760
What's happening
is the hammer is being pulled back

89
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,240
into firing position
and, at the same time,

90
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,000
the cylinder is advancing
a fresh bullet into the chamber.

91
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,400
Requires quite a deliberate effort
to discharge every bullet.

92
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,880
So not the kind of trigger that you
could pull by mistake, then?

93
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,120
'Not easily, no.

94
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,440
It's a gun. It's not a toy.'

95
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,560
'And the other thing
to consider here

96
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,840
is that the bullet strikes
on the bones

97
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,760
are also extremely similar
in both victims...

98
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,440
and suggests
they were facing the gun.'

99
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,080
'What would your overall conclusion
be, taking all that into account?'

100
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,520
My working assumption would be
that the same shooter

101
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,200
discharged all four bullets,

102
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,040
which is to say
that both William and Patricia

103
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,560
were most likely killed
by the same person,

104
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,760
and that he or she was probably
familiar with this sort of weapon.

105
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,680
It's not like this is
the biggest gun in the world
but it's still quite serious.

106
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,560
Do you know what I mean?
No further questions, My Lady.

107
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,520
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall give...

108
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,720
..shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth.

109
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,600
What sort of films
did Gary Cooper star in, Mr Edwards?

110
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,760
He was a Hollywood actor
in the '40s and '50s,

111
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,840
is that correct?
And '60s, yes.

112
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,680
And '60s.
Yes, thank you for clarifying.

113
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,600
He was, er,
principally known for Westerns.

114
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,200
But he played a wide range
of characters -

115
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,080
romantic leads, comedies, soldiers.

116
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,600
And, er, of course,

117
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,600
he once played baseball player
Lou Gehrig in Pride Of The Yankees.

118
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,280
But isn't it true, Chris,

119
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,080
that you and your wife
loved stories about the Wild West?

120
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,800
About gunslingers and outlaws?

121
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,520
Well, Susan was the Gary Cooper fan.

122
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,600
And it was all perfectly harmless.

123
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,360
Members of the jury,
please refer to document EL-96.

124
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,440
This is an invoice from 2009,

125
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,200
for an authenticated
Gary Cooper letter costing £2,700.

126
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,480
You spent £2,700
on a Gary Cooper letter

127
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,880
despite being
on the verge of bankruptcy?

128
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,560
It was a gift for Susan.

129
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,080
And we were not
on the verge of bankruptcy.

130
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,600
Mr Edwards, when you and your wife

131
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,720
were arrested
on your return from France,

132
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,960
you had nothing
but a few coins between you.

133
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,840
The only personal belongings you had
were a few signed photos and books.

134
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,360
You personally have a correspondence
with the actor Gerard Depardieu.

135
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,720
So, it is preposterous to suggest
that you were not a participant

136
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,040
in this world of overblown heroes
and Hollywood stars and guns.

137
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,640
If you wanna get into the detail -
Listen to my question -

138
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,320
Well, now you're
interrupting my answer.

139
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,960
You owned a gun of the same calibre

140
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,760
as the one that shot your in-laws,
didn't you?

141
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,680
At one time I owned a revolver
that was capable of taking

142
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,120
.38-calibre cartridges, yes.

143
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,240
You had .38-calibre cartridges.

144
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,760
Not in May 1998, I didn't.

145
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,200
I had neither cartridges
nor firearms. I had sold them.

146
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,440
Your wife hates guns, doesn't she?

147
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
She certainly doesn't like them.

148
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,880
You told the police
she was terrified of them.

149
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,880
That she wouldn't even touch one
at the firing range.

150
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,640
That's correct.
She's generally very fragile.

151
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,640
Another thing we haven't spent -

152
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,480
What about you, Chris?

153
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,560
You like guns, don't you?

154
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,600
I'm interested in guns.

155
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,400
I am interested in military history
and guns are simply a part of that.

156
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,280
Chris, could we just clarify
something for the jury?

157
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,600
You used to fire such weapons,
didn't you? Quite often?

158
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,960
Not often, no, because the er...

159
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,080
the club where I did my shooting
was in Earl's Court.

160
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,520
So, from Dagenham,
I had to change trains twice,

161
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,960
so by the time I got home,
it was very late.

162
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,760
And then after Susan moved in,
it started to feel like I...

163
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,160
Well, it wasn't worth it any more,
so I sold the guns

164
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,440
and surrendered
my firearms certificate

165
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,960
and that was in September 1995.

166
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,400
But before you lived with Susan, you
would've happily made the journey?

167
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,400
Yes.
So, what changed?

168
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,120
Susan didn't like me being away
from home for too long
unless it was for work.

169
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,200
Or she didn't like me being away
from HER, perhaps I should say.

170
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,000
But you enjoyed this hobby,
didn't you?

171
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,120
Yes.

172
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,280
Did you feel like it was your choice

173
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,240
to stop making that journey,
or did Susan make you do it?

174
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,840
Um... It was... It was mutual.

175
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,240
And when you buried the bodies,
was that your choice?

176
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,640
Or did Susan make you do it?

177
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,400
It was erm...
Was it mutual?

178
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,680
Yes.

179
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,080
And when you phoned your step-mother

180
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,400
to tell her
about the bodies in the garden,

181
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,920
that was YOUR choice, wasn't it?

182
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,120
That was a choice you made
independently without Susan.

183
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,680
And that is why
we are all here today, isn't it?

184
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,400
You must have been in a great deal
of pain and discomfort

185
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,920
to choose this over what you
could've had in France, with Susan.

186
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,760
I made a choice to marry Susan
because I loved her...

187
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,040
..and since then I've been living
Susan's life with her.

188
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,880
My life didn't really come into it.
It wasn't important any more.

189
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,280
Chris.

190
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,200
Huh?

191
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,520
'Would you be able to show us,
Chris, how to fire a gun?

192
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,840
A .38, for example?'

193
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,560
Well, there are many styles.

194
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,480
My training was in something called
"precision target shooting".

195
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,280
You begin with a pistol
in front of you, unloaded.

196
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,000
And let's say the target is erm...
well, where My Ladyship is.

197
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,200
And you take your position,
bringing up the hand

198
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,880
to make sure you're pointing
naturally in that direction.

199
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,760
Take out the pistol,
fit it to the hand very precisely

200
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,160
cos you need to get
a consistency of grip.

201
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,680
In the case of a revolver,
you put the cartridges into it
and then close it.

202
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,040
Take a couple of gentle,
deep breaths.

203
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,720
And then raise...the pistol.

204
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,200
Breathe out...

205
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
..both eyes open.

206
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,600
And what you're looking for...

207
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,720
is something they call
the "surprise break"...

208
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,640
..which is when the shot goes off
without you even thinking about it.

209
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,240
Here, take this.
What do I do with it?

210
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,680
Aargh!
Move forward!

211
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,880
Just run, Susan! Go!
No!

212
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,200
I'll take care of this. Just go now!
No! Not without you.

213
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,560
Susan, I'm begging you!

214
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,920
Just do it!
No! Not without you!

215
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
I'll find you.

216
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,920
Susan, I'm begging you. Just run!
I'll be all right.

217
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,800
How did they know we'd be here?

218
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,120
Chris? How did they know?

219
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,840
Susan...

220
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,200
Susan! What are you doing?

221
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,560
Aargh!

222
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,640
Aargh!

223
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,600
Aargh!

224
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,960
'Would you mind speaking up,
please, Mrs Edwards.

225
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,480
It's quite hard to hear
what you're saying.'

226
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,240
'I can't remember clearly, erm...

227
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,040
She had just killed my father,

228
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,360
and she was saying
those dreadful things to me,

229
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,120
and at some point I just...'

230
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,680
'You pulled the trigger?'
'Yes.'

231
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,160
Louder, please, Mrs Edwards.
Yes, I pulled the trigger.

232
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,320
But as we heard from our expert,
such an action would have required

233
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,360
two separate applications of force,
not hair trigger, but deliberate.

234
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,880
Enough to cock it and fire the gun.
Twice. Bang-bang.

235
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,520
You did that?

236
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,200
I... I don't know
exactly how I did it.

237
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,680
I've spent 16 years
trying to forget what happened.

238
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,040
All I know is I was provoked.

239
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,920
Did you even look to see
if you could help your father

240
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,480
when you saw he'd been shot?

241
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,560
No, I didn't
want to look at my father.

242
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,480
It... It was frightening.

243
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,880
Perhaps you might be able to tell me
a little about the brass casings

244
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,040
that you told the police
you saw on the floor

245
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,360
and that you disposed of
with the gun.

246
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,640
Erm...there were casings.

247
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,800
Erm blastings. I...
I don't know, I saw them.

248
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,560
And what did you do with the gun?
To dispose of it?

249
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,240
I wrapped it up
along with the casings that I...

250
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,840
that were on the floor,

251
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,840
and I put it in a bag, and then
I took it into town and I...

252
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,480
put it in an empty rubbish bin

253
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,920
so that other things
would be put on top.

254
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,920
A rubbish bin?
In the middle of the street?

255
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,360
Yeah, it was the Tuesday
after bank holiday.

256
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Then you went directly
from the rubbish bin to the bank,

257
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,080
which we've already discussed.
Where did you go after the bank?

258
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,000
I returned to the house

259
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,320
after buying some air fresheners.

260
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,320
Oh, you bought air fresheners?

261
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,400
Yes, about 20 of them.

262
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,120
Cos I...I thought the bodies
might start to smell

263
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,880
and...and the house already stank
of smoke and nicotine,

264
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,440
and I hated that smell.

265
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,640
You've never mentioned
the air fresheners to the police

266
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,040
and yet after Dr Dickson's
very vivid description

267
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,640
of how a body decomposes,
suddenly you bought 20 of them.

268
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,920
I did... I forgot.
I didn't think it was important.

269
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,960
Did you know, Mrs Edwards,

270
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,480
that a revolver of this type
does not discharge casings?

271
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,240
Did you know that?
No.

272
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,960
Could you speak up please,
Mrs Edwards, so we can all hear you?

273
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,920
Sorry. No.
You didn't know.

274
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,120
But if you had fired the gun,
you would've seen

275
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,960
it produced no casings,
wouldn't you,

276
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,840
and you wouldn't have made them up.

277
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,440
Isn't it a pity
that you didn't go over that detail
with your husband before the arrest?

278
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,720
No, they... I saw them.

279
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,320
They would not have become
part of your story, would they?

280
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,080
No, they were there.
They were there on the floor.

281
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,880
And can you tell me why you wrapped
your parents' bodies

282
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,080
in duvet covers, Mrs Edwards?

283
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,960
To hide them,
to make it as if it hadn't happened.

284
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,360
Cos I didn't want to see them.
I didn't want to look at them.

285
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Is that also why you destroyed
the photographs, the letters,

286
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,160
the diaries, that you burned
outside your apartment in France,

287
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,840
as we heard from the defence?

288
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,560
The intention there
isn't to preserve

289
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,280
the memory of your parents, is it?

290
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,480
That's you trying to wipe your
parents off the face of the Earth.

291
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,240
It wasn't enough
that they were dead.

292
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,000
You had to burn all trace
that they had ever existed.

293
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,400
And they are not here
to defend themselves, are they?

294
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,480
I don't -
The victims of these shootings,

295
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,760
what would they have told us,
do you think?

296
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,680
What would be their side
- of the story?
- Please.

297
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,120
You have painted them
in the worst possible light.

298
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,440
You were their daughter,
weren't you, their only daughter?

299
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,120
No, they said I was a mistake
and they said they never
wanted to get married,

300
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,200
they wouldn't have,
if Mum hadn't got pregnant.

301
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,800
They hated each other
and they didn't want me.

302
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,880
But they must have loved you on
some level, they were your parents.

303
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,600
No, no, cos I'm...
I'm impossible to love.

304
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,280
Mrs Edwards?

305
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,320
I'm impossible to love.

306
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,000
That's what my mother
would say to me all the time

307
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,000
and it's true...

308
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,680
I... I know now that it's true.

309
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,280
Would you like to take a break,
Mrs Edwards,

310
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,960
if you're having
a bit of a fragile moment?

311
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,240
No.

312
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,280
I'm not fragile.

313
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,040
I'm not fragile.

314
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,000
I'm broken.

315
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
So, you can't hurt me.

316
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,720
You can send me to prison
and you can all laugh at me

317
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,880
and you can make me look like
a piece of dirt

318
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,880
in front of all these people
but I'm broken so you can't hurt me.

319
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,840
No-one can hurt me any more.

320
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,800
Chris!

321
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,160
Chris!

322
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,840
Chris!

323
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,880
'(GUNSHOT)'

324
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,200
Do you want to get
an ice cream cone?

325
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,480
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, I'm gonna get strawberry.

326
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,320
'There's not much we can do
about it now, is there?'

327
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,640
I did have one thought, though...

328
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,680
..that maybe we should've told the
barrister or I should have told you

329
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,480
about Gerard Depardieu.

330
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,040
I've never told anyone this before.

331
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,480
Are you sure you wanna tell me?

332
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,120
So, just after Chris's brother
passed away,

333
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,480
I wrote to Gerard Depardieu,
asking for a signed photo

334
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,640
cos I thought it would
cheer Chris up.

335
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,480
He didn't know anything about films
or France when we got together.

336
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,840
But, er, somehow, he did know
about Gerard Depardieu.

337
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,720
'And then, eventually,
after a few weeks of waiting,

338
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,720
I decided I would write
back to Chris

339
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,320
pretending to be Gerard Depardieu.

340
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,240
I practised his signature
until I got it just right.

341
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,480
And I practised his handwriting.

342
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,720
And I put in spelling mistakes
and things,

343
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,800
you know, so it looked like
it was written by a French person.

344
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,360
Well, it worked. He bought it.'

345
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,560
And it made him so happy...

346
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,040
that I just kept doing it.

347
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,680
I kept writing to him,
pretending I was Gerard Depardieu.

348
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,840
And then Chris would write back,
all excited.

349
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,400
But he never knew
that I was behind it all.

350
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,320
Er, where was he sending
the letters?

351
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,200
Oh, well, I thought of all that too.

352
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,480
So, the first one went
to erm... Apartment 16,

353
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,320
Rue Madam Zephirine, 75014 Paris.

354
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,080
And then there was
an address in Belgium.

355
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,920
And later on,
there was an address in Russia.

356
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,560
But I just made them all up.'

357
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,080
Bye, love!

358
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,880
Have a nice day!

359
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,560
'Cos it didn't matter
where they ended up.

360
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,920
I always read his letters
before he sent them,

361
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,760
so I knew exactly how to reply.

362
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,480
And you might think that Chris
would become suspicious

363
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,560
those letters had London postmarks,
but they didn't.

364
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,000
Because I had a franking machine!

365
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,760
Just had to pick a few well chosen
words in the right language

366
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,440
and hey, presto.'

367
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,840
'Wow...and you did all that
just to make Chris happy.'

368
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,600
'I think, even if I told him,
he wouldn't believe me.'

369
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,520
"Good morning,
I'm Gerard Depardieu."

370
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,440
"No, you're not Gerard Depardieu -

371
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,600
you're a librarian from Harlesden,
for crying out loud!"

372
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Least, I don't think he knew.

373
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,000
Mm.

374
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,960
It wouldn't have helped, would it?

375
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,360
Mm-mm.

376
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,080
I get you, Susan.

377
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
I don't know why I get you,
but I get you.

378
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,680
And I find that story really sweet.

379
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,880
That you would do something
like that for him.

380
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,760
But other people...

381
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Yeah.
..might not get it.

382
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,680
I just think it wouldn't
have played, that's all,

383
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,240
because you're on trial.

384
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,760
Anything weird,
anything that isn't just "normal",

385
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,720
will make people assume -
They'll think I'm bad news.

386
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,240
And I hate that, by the way.

387
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,840
Because...

388
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,880
..I like that you're you.

389
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,320
Honestly, I... I honestly think
I will carry this experience with me

390
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,480
for the rest of my life because...

391
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,120
..you know what,
you're right, Susan.

392
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,960
I'm lucky.

393
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,560
It's not the same for me.

394
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,360
And you've helped me
to appreciate that.

395
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,840
Not because you're unlucky.
I don't mean it like that, though.

396
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,760
Or maybe I DO mean it like that.
I... I... I dunno.

397
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,400
I'm not saying
that has to define you

398
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,440
or that it's even the reason why
we're here right now in court but...

399
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,520
..they should have looked after you,
Susan.

400
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,120
They were your parents.
You were seven years old.

401
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,560
Do you know how tall
a seven-year-old is? This tall.

402
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,320
This tall.

403
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,320
So, er... I'm still learning.

404
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,760
Maybe I could have done
a better job for you.

405
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,760
I don't know.

406
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,040
I tried my best, I really did.

407
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,960
But I just wanted to make sure
that you understand

408
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,440
that whatever happens today...

409
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,160
..there's a lot
that has happened in your life

410
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
that is not on you.

411
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,800
But given that you left home
in your early twenties...

412
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
..15 years before the murders,

413
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,640
I cannot accept that his conduct

414
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,920
explains your decision to kill him.

415
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,760
You thought your parents had
deprived you of an inheritance

416
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,320
that was rightfully yours.

417
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,960
I am sure it was you, Christopher
Edwards, who held the gun.

418
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,240
But I have no doubt
that you were acting together,

419
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,600
and I see no reason to distinguish
between you on sentence.

420
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,160
Can you imagine ever, like,
actually murdering someone?

421
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,280
I can imagine it, yeah.

422
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,160
I don't think I'd ever do it,
though.

423
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,120
Why? Are you thinking of trying it?
Bit of murder?

424
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,640
Just trying to imagine
actually having a gun

425
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,440
and pointing it at your...
Your mum and dad.

426
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,720
Yeah. So fucked up.

427
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,200
It's sad.

428
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,320
Yeah. I guess so.

429
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,160
I threatened me dad once...

430
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
..when he'd been at me mum.

431
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,760
I sat on it for a bit.

432
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,120
There was no point me
trying anything when he was pissed

433
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,920
cos he'd just kick the shit
out of me.

434
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,280
But a few days later,
when he was watching telly,

435
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,280
I got an axe from the garage

436
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,720
and I went up to the sofa
and I said...

437
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,960
.."If you touch Mum again...

438
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,840
..I'll chop your fucking head off."

439
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,520
Jesus.

440
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,680
How old were you?

441
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,360
12.

442
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,400
Then what happened?

443
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,160
He left.

444
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,360
Shit, man.

445
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,720
Sorry.

446
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,560
Don't fucking hug me, you twat.

447
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,840
OK.
That's not...

448
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,120
Just offering you a hug. Sorry.
Pervert.

449
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,960
Fuck off. Why would I try it on
after a story like that? That's mad.

450
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,240
When WOULD you do it, then?
I don't know.

451
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,920
I'd just ask you out for a drink,
whenever.

452
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,760
Right.

453
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,160
In what way?

454
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,360
Well, in that way, if you're asking.

455
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,880
Are you asking?

456
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,800
Yeah, all right I'm asking.

457
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,440
No, I don't think so. Sorry.

458
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,440
What?

459
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,720
I would in theory.
But...not in practice.

460
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,840
Maybe in, like, ten years.
Just before my eggs start to dry up.

461
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,400
Shall we go for a drink
just as friends, then?

462
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,960
Or as partners even?

463
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,040
I need a bit more than a drink.
It's been quite an intense few days.

464
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,360
Oh, well, like what?
Like a fuck.

465
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,080
No, not with you.
Don't get any ideas.

466
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,560
You're a sensitive lad, I can tell.

467
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,240
It'll get a bit complicated and then
it'll go a bit... Chris and Susan.

468
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,760
But I'm not gonna offer
to kill your dad for ya.

469
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,640
I'm not asking you to.
We're going to the pub.

470
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,640
You're gonna be my wingman.

471
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,680
Fucking wingman?
Yeah.

472
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,640
Fuck off.

473
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,200
Chop, chop.

474
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,600
'Dear Susan,
thank you for your letters,

475
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,760
which I have been very grateful
to receive.

476
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm sorry it's taken me
so long to reply.

477
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,800
The first pen I received
was very scratchy

478
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,200
and I wanted you to be able to read
what I was saying.

479
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,720
So I waited to be furnished
with the brand of implement

480
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,280
I originally asked for, which I'm
happy to say is working much better.

481
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,920
In answer to your question
about Tabitha, the truth is, Susan,

482
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,880
that I don't entirely know
why I did that.

483
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,840
But I do think that,
on some level, you are right.

484
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,720
I felt like I was struggling,

485
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,800
and I needed to ask somebody
for help,

486
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,160
something that,
traditionally speaking,
I have not been very good at.

487
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,280
I think, though, that you're wrong
about how I felt, in other ways.

488
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,400
Because I never felt like
I had to leave the real world behind

489
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,440
to be with you, Susan.

490
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:27,280
If anything, you are the person
who made the world feel real to me.

491
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,720
It wasn't you who made me
feel trapped, Susan.

492
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,560
It was me.'

493
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:52,080
'In the movies, there are the good
guys and there are the bad guys.

494
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,600
And I think we will have to accept
that, for most people,

495
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,760
we will always be the bad guys.

496
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,560
But we love each other, Susan.

497
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,640
And nobody can take that
away from us.

498
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,720
Yours forever and always...

499
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,720
..Gerard Depardieu.'

500
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,120
Ah, there you are!

501
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,160
Come with me, please.

502
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,720
Checks, please.

503
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,160
Stand by.

504
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,760
Stand by.

505
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,200
Roll sound.

506
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,680
Sound rolling!

507
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,840
All right, let's do this.

508
