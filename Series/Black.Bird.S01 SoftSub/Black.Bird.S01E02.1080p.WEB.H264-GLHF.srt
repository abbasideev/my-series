1
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,899
Do you like women, Jimmy?

2
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,112
What do you think?

3
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:20,701
I love 'em.

4
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,994
Yeah?

5
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,298
What do you like about them?

6
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:41,138
I like… their softness.

7
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,601
The way their hands feel in mine.
Making 'em laugh.

8
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,477
Blondes or brunettes?

9
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:55,027
I've dated every type.
Blonde, Asian, short, tall.

10
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,653
Big tits, small tits?

11
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,489
All kinds.

12
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,741
But good tits?

13
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,699
You don't like saggy tits,

14
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,413
or tits that point
in different directions?

15
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,583
Not for you.

16
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,462
Okay. So, outside of hotness,
great tits, great ass, great hair...

17
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:18,091
Wait, you don't get hung up on hair.
What do you like about women?

18
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:21,803
Everything.

19
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,598
I got sisters.

20
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,525
Women are more…

21
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:37,528
kind.

22
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,949
I can chill with a woman
in a way I never could with a dude.

23
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,079
I can just be.

24
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,582
But what do you like about them?

25
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,380
I like this.

26
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,053
I'm not saying
anything's gonna happen, but…

27
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,100
possibility's there.

28
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,020
What don't you like about women?

29
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,523
Nothing.

30
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,318
What do you think
Larry Hall doesn't like about women?

31
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,365
How the fuck do I know?

32
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,867
So, what good are you to me?

33
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,123
You show me you can find
common ground with this man,

34
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,666
or you are wasting my time.

35
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,716
You said you dreamed
of killing women?

36
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,640
You said you dreamed
of killing women.

37
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,270
Larry.

38
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,399
What? I dre...
It's not like that.

39
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:01,612
No, I don't dream of killing women.

40
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,198
I just have a lot of dreams
from killing them.

41
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:08,285
You know. And Gary says that he has
a lot of dreams about falling.

42
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,912
Uh-huh. Who's Gary?

43
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:12,748
My twin.

44
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,128
Gary also once told me

45
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,714
that he has a lot of dreams
about drowning.

46
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,092
But not killing women, right?
That's more your thing.

47
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:28,597
And tell me
what these dreams are like, Larry.

48
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,518
The dreams are like...

49
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,145
It's like…

50
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:41,026
I'm kinda looking down on myself,
like I'm not in my body.

51
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,030
Do you remember
what your body is doing, Larry?

52
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,327
I can't tell you exactly.

53
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,499
I only remember
that it's something bad.

54
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,836
Where women are being killed?

55
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:01,672
Sometimes.

56
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:03,549
Yeah.

57
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,850
Do any of the women look like her?

58
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,397
She in any of your dreams?

59
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,023
I wanna go home now.

60
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,608
Okay, is she, Larry?

61
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,532
I wanna go home, Chris.

62
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,076
Larry, just look at the photo here.

63
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,454
- I wanna go home.
- Okay, but is she...

64
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,214
- I wanna go home.
- Okay, I'll take you home.

65
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,411
- I'll take you home.
- Okay.

66
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,502
- Larry, it's okay.
- It's okay.

67
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,462
Can I talk to you outside?

68
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,506
It's okay.
We're good.

69
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:52,014
We got him in there
talking about his dreams.

70
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,057
That's all they are.
We don't have anything.

71
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,311
- Because you didn't let me get it.
- Larry talks big. That's it.

72
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,730
He did the same thing with us
in the Reitler case.

73
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:04,109
Well, if your high-end detective skills
can't be trusted, whose can, right?

74
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,905
- Don't fucking talk to me like that.
- I agree. Your tone's not helping.

75
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,742
Detective Miller,
I appreciate your passion here. I do.

76
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,328
But we do have our guy
in the Reitler case.

77
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,872
And it's as open and shut
as I've seen in ten years.

78
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,960
Why not go back to Illinois,
build your case for the Roach girl,

79
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,804
then come back to Indiana
where she was found

80
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,005
and take another run at Hall?

81
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,466
None of us would object to that.

82
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:35,307
We'll respect your sandbox,
and you respect ours.

83
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,831
Fuck your sandbox.

84
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:03,794
I don't know.

85
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,254
It was the way he said,

86
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,090
"Come back to Indiana
where she was found."

87
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,425
Made you think what?

88
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,679
Made me think they could steal the case
right out from under me.

89
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,973
- On what grounds?
- Thanks.

90
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,564
Well, Jessica Roach was abducted
in Illinois.

91
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:26,650
Probably killed there too.
That's inconclusive.

92
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,279
She was found, though, in Perrysville,
Indiana, and that is conclusive.

93
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,489
So, they can claim jurisdiction.

94
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,449
Yeah.

95
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,786
Except…

96
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,498
No. You say it.
Your moment.

97
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:44,877
Our suspect crossed state lines to
kill her, so, you know…

98
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,378
Federal.

99
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,088
Yeah.

100
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:51,008
Well, most US attorneys,
they don't try murder cases.

101
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,361
When they do, they've been known
to get their asses handed to them.

102
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:58,807
But Hulin just brought in
an assassin, Edmund Beaumont.

103
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,059
He used to be state's.
Tried a ton of capital crimes.

104
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,311
Hulin likes you?

105
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:04,563
Seems to.

106
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,735
Put a bug in her ear
about Beaumont.

107
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:14,406
If Hulin agrees to bring us in,
and she puts Beaumont on it…

108
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,118
Brian, you got a shot
at slamming the door on this guy.

109
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,457
Mark will lead the interview.

110
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,336
If Hall throat-kills women,
I don't want Lauren in the room.

111
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,046
Might spook him.

112
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,173
I have a guy
I'd like to use for the poly.

113
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:32,966
Mark could do the poly.

114
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,344
When are you cleared to part us?

115
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,054
I'm in court all week.

116
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,431
Then let's do the 15th?

117
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:41,767
It's a lot of time for things
to go wrong.

118
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,022
Marion or Wabash could claim jurisdiction
at any time. Hall could get a lawyer.

119
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,858
Jackrabbit, take off, kill again.

120
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:54,029
You brought this to us.
This is how we're gonna do it.

121
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,207
What are you smiling about?

122
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,713
I think you already picked me
for the job.

123
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,300
Yeah?

124
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,636
Yeah, I'm not sure
there ever was anybody else.

125
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,806
I got black belts
in karate and tae kwon do,

126
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,935
and I'm… charming.

127
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,271
And you're so bashful about it.

128
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,484
- You think it'll endear you to Hall?
- Possibly.

129
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,695
Maybe he'll wanna hang out
with the cool guy.

130
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,591
Here's your competition, Jimmy.

131
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:56,925
Won a boxing championship

132
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,303
while serving with the Rangers
during Desert Storm.

133
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,513
So, I think he can handle himself.

134
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:03,891
Personable,
non-threatening demeanor,

135
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,018
and he doesn't have an ego
that announces itself

136
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,145
half an hour before he enters
a fucking room.

137
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,147
- So, pick him.
- Beaumont wants to.

138
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:14,109
You are full of yourself, and you are
full of shit. That's all he sees.

139
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:17,154
- Yeah, that's all you tell him.
- 'Cause that's pretty much all I see.

140
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,822
Why'd your parents divorce?

141
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:26,121
They had too much fire and passion,
but they loved us,

142
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,873
- and they wondered what we...
- Bullshit.

143
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,128
Look, I didn't get along
with my stepfather, okay,

144
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:34,856
but I could care less
if my parents were...

145
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,881
Bullshit!

146
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,055
Don't fucking waste my time.

147
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,899
Are you...
You're leaving now?

148
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,989
All right, come on.
My mother fucked around.

149
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,120
I think.

150
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:14,127
My old man was always drinking,
never home.

151
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:18,215
And he might have been on the take,

152
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,927
so it was like growing up
in an earthquake.

153
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,064
We didn't have any choice
in any of it.

154
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,649
They just did what they did,

155
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,486
and we had to…
take it.

156
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,785
That house was
a fucking horror show.

157
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,122
Must have been lonely.

158
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,000
It was what it was.

159
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:03,510
If you end up in with Hall,

160
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,638
I want you to remember
who you were at eight.

161
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:11,810
Tap into it. Feel it.
Wear it like skin.

162
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:15,981
I don't like that skin.

163
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,026
Hall doesn't like his either.

164
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,790
Where are you with the file?

165
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:36,502
I…

166
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:40,047
Yeah, I've been looking
at the Jessica Roach killing again,

167
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,466
and I… I have a question.

168
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,013
How'd she die?
It's blacked out.

169
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,598
She was strangled.

170
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:50,682
But how?

171
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:54,102
- He used his hands, or rope? What?
- You tell me if you talk to him.

172
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:56,480
But you know.

173
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,610
I know.

174
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,247
Larry, thanks for coming down.

175
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,958
- Hey.
- Brought along a colleague.

176
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,919
This is Agent Ellenberg from the FBI.

177
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,712
Glad to meet you, Mr. Hall.

178
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:23,006
I'm Larry.
Just call me Larry.

179
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,758
Well, call me Mark.

180
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,301
Mark.

181
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:29,346
Do you need anything?
Water? Soda?

182
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,974
Water would be nice, yeah.

183
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:35,269
Want a water?
Yeah, let me get that.

184
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:41,275
Wanna have a seat?

185
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,374
What is this?

186
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,042
Waiver of rights.

187
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:03,505
It just says
you're okay talking with me,

188
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:05,090
answering a few questions.

189
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:08,427
Do you mind
if I look over it for a bit?

190
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,678
Sure.

191
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:36,371
This is consent for the polygraph.

192
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:37,956
I can't take that.

193
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,126
Why not?

194
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,795
Because I don't believe I'll pass.

195
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,093
Why do you think that?

196
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:55,682
It would...

197
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,396
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

198
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,193
Could you just do...

199
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:09,445
Would you mind leaving? I ju...
Your energy makes me feel itchy.

200
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,325
Sure thing, Larry.

201
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,591
You know, I am sorry.
I'm just so tired right now.

202
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,010
I'm afraid to sleep.

203
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,096
I have nightmares all the time,

204
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:38,100
and I… and I get depressed,
like, bad.

205
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,602
Have you seen anyone about that?

206
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:44,565
Yeah, I went to a counselor once,
but it...

207
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:45,858
He was young.

208
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,151
And he wasn't very helpful.

209
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,236
Yeah.

210
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:55,492
Well, besides the nightmares,
what else depresses you?

211
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,829
I'm very lonely.

212
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,206
That's hard.

213
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,626
Yeah, it is hard.
Like, I wake up alone.

214
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,629
I go to work alone.
I go to bed alone.

215
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,385
Some other guys, they have women.

216
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:17,097
They go to movies.
They eat pizza together.

217
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:20,684
And you wish you had that?
A woman who loved you.

218
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,062
Yes.

219
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:27,608
But you don't feel that's possible?
You don't think women like you?

220
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,404
No.

221
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:33,655
So…

222
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:38,202
What do you do with the urge…
to be with a woman?

223
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:41,663
Always push it down.

224
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:43,373
It's gotta be hard.

225
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,878
And it's probably what causes
the nightmares.

226
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:51,006
You know, you push it down,
it climbs right back up into your dreams.

227
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:54,760
Yeah, that's why I do such awful things
in my nightmares, it...

228
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:57,888
That's all that they are, though.
It's just dreams, you know.

229
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:07,314
She wasn't in your dreams, Larry.
She was in your reality.

230
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:12,236
I thought she was.

231
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,820
No.

232
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,867
Can I touch her?

233
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:22,579
Sure.

234
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,381
Tell me how you met her.

235
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,512
She was riding her bike,

236
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:42,015
and I drove up
and I stopped to talk to her.

237
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:46,436
She was so very nice, you know.
Very nice at first.

238
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,146
And then she wasn't?

239
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,481
No, she was always nice.

240
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:53,235
It's just that she got sad,
real sad.

241
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:54,695
Well, when was this?

242
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:58,323
When she was sad,
she was in m...

243
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,784
When she was in my van.

244
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:05,581
And then later in the field…

245
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,709
The field in Georgetown?

246
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,503
Yeah, it wa...
in Perrysville, Indiana.

247
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:16,508
Right, do you remember
where exactly?

248
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:21,889
I do remember where it was exactly.
It was just past mile marker 16 on 1125.

249
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:25,809
Normally, I wouldn't remember that.
I might not remember it, but…

250
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:30,230
I didn't have time to bury her,

251
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:33,859
so I had to drive past
a few more times.

252
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,946
Tried to find an opportunity,
but I never found it.

253
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,531
It didn't happen.

254
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:41,408
I mean,
normally I bury all of them.

255
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:43,827
Them?

256
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:46,538
The girls.

257
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,082
How many have there been?

258
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,253
It's... There...
It's a few.

259
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:55,422
You know, I... I'm...

260
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:57,508
I just do things.

261
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:01,553
I'm not in control.

262
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:07,893
It's like that girl in Marion.
The college girl.

263
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,356
Now, you know her name, Larry.

264
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,693
Tricia Reitler, yes.

265
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,822
You know, the Marion Police arrested
another man in that case.

266
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:22,282
He didn't do it.

267
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,998
There was one in Wisconsin,
near one of the reenactments,

268
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,334
and some in Indiana.

269
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,336
I can't remember which ones I hurt.

270
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,840
It's just...
I'm so tired all the time.

271
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:42,052
I'm always tired,
you know, and sad.

272
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:52,020
And what I don't like is
this guy in Marion

273
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:53,522
trying to take credit for my act.

274
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,858
He didn't fold the clothes.

275
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,027
He didn't fold the clothes, did he?

276
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:01,113
- No.
- No.

277
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:06,577
Because he didn't break the zipper,
and he didn't feel bad about it.

278
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,495
And that's why
I folded the clothes.

279
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:16,920
Yeah.

280
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:40,736
I need a confession form
and a computer.

281
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:45,490
I'll set you up in the bullpen.

282
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:49,953
What...
What's this about the clothes?

283
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:54,291
Tricia Reitler's clothes were found
in a park about 10 miles from campus.

284
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,376
That, and a bloody earring was
ripped from her ear,

285
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,540
her blood was on her jeans,

286
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:01,173
and her zipper was broken
where her jeans had been taken off of her.

287
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:03,884
- She fought him.
- None of this is public information.

288
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:06,803
- We need a warrant on his home.
- On it.

289
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:08,180
And on his vehicles.

290
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:14,895
You're a county
sheriff's investigator.

291
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:16,980
I'm Chief Investigator.

292
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:21,109
And you just reeled
in a serial killer.

293
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:25,405
Well, we haven't done shit yet.
Let's close him.

294
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:26,657
You're all set.

295
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,701
- We got it?
- Yeah.

296
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,252
He just asked
if he should contact a lawyer.

297
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:21,753
Almost there.

298
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:23,130
- Come on.
- Okay.

299
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,300
- Gotta go.
- Yeah.

300
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:35,726
Mark.

301
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,477
Okay, I got it.

302
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,355
- Go. Yeah.
- Print it?

303
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:44,693
Fucking thing.

304
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:54,745
This is what I did?

305
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,171
I didn't do this.

306
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:06,673
I didn't.

307
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:11,595
Yeah, but you did, Larry.

308
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:17,768
You did.

309
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,786
No wonder
why I can't sleep at night.

310
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:04,606
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

311
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,442
Larry…

312
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:11,071
it'll be all right.

313
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:19,121
Nothing's ever gonna be
all right again.

314
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:24,918
Forget how I'm doing.
How you doing?

315
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:29,631
I'm, you know, whatever.

316
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:31,675
I don't know, Dad.
How are you?

317
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:37,973
I'm weak.

318
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:41,143
My left side is...

319
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:46,732
I forget my keys, a lot.
You know, shit like that.

320
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,567
What are you gonna do?

321
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,110
It is what it is.

322
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:51,445
Sammy taking care of you?

323
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:53,447
Too much.

324
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:57,034
I can't take a piss
without her asking me what color it is.

325
00:26:57,117 --> 00:27:00,537
I said, "It's yellow."
"Yeah, but dark or light?"

326
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:04,541
Yeah, you.

327
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,630
Well, good for her, you old prick.
Listen to her.

328
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,757
Yeah, yeah.

329
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,219
Seriously, how you doing in there?

330
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:16,720
Jimmy, time's up.

331
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,013
Dad, I gotta roll.

332
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:19,848
Talk soon, okay?

333
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:23,018
Yeah, sure.
Stay safe.

334
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:24,144
You too.

335
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:39,868
What?

336
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:43,163
What?

337
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,751
You could've told him

338
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:50,337
you went blind in one eye
for a couple of days last week.

339
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,755
Who wants to hear that?

340
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,425
Or you got trouble
walking or talking some days.

341
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:57,761
- Just s... You know, will you stop it?
- What?

342
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:59,805
- Just stop!
- What?

343
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:02,474
Just, you know...

344
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:03,559
What?

345
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:05,102
Stop.

346
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:12,442
Me and my son, we have a shorthand.
We say things without having to say them.

347
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:15,362
- You don't say anything at all.
- That's what I just said.

348
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:23,829
Yeah, have some more wine.

349
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:25,873
Take your purple pill.

350
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:47,394
Hey, Jason!

351
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,608
Thanks, we're moving on.
Close it up.

352
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,193
Seen these yet?

353
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:56,612
As nasty as the house?

354
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:57,905
One of 'em is.

355
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:01,742
Uh-huh.

356
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:05,204
What about the other one?

357
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:18,175
First ERT guy said, to his expert nose,
it smells like three things.

358
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:21,637
Chemical cleanser, Armor All,
and denatured alcohol.

359
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:25,349
The one thing in the world
Larry Hall keeps clean.

360
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,142
Right?

361
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:04,555
So, no more dentist?

362
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:10,978
Hall was a janitor.

363
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:13,355
Worked nights
on the same three office buildings.

364
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:16,817
Company said no janitor they ever had
cleaned half as good as Larry.

365
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:20,654
That's why you never found
his victims' DNA in his van.

366
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:24,491
Bingo. What's the other salient fact
that made Hall such a competent killer?

367
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:27,119
He grew up digging graves?

368
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,205
Starting to ace the quizzes now.

369
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:34,960
What about his twin?

370
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:36,044
Gary?

371
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,881
You read about
fetofetal transfusion syndrome?

372
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:41,300
Yeah, I didn't know what it meant.

373
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:42,551
It happens in the womb

374
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:46,430
when one twin imbibes
more of the placenta blood than the other.

375
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:49,349
Essentially, Gary drank
crucial parts of Larry

376
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:50,559
before they were born.

377
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:53,437
Holy shit.

378
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,065
So, Gary got the looks and the brains
and some athletic ability,

379
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:00,819
and Larry got… being Larry.

380
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,155
They get along?

381
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:05,407
Gary is Larry's biggest defender.

382
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:08,410
My brother's not well.

383
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:11,079
He's weird as shit,
but he's harmless.

384
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:15,042
Gary, I'm gonna need you to take
two steps back.

385
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:22,966
Your brother confessed
to two murders.

386
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:28,222
He's just... He's so desperate,
you know? For attention.

387
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:31,141
When we were kids,
he'd try out lies just to lie, all right?

388
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:33,185
He lies just to get a reaction.

389
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,688
He ever mix the truth
in with those lies?

390
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:38,857
See if anybody catches it?

391
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:41,151
We're just regular people here.
Okay?

392
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:43,570
We don't kill people.
We don't know people who kill people.

393
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,490
How'd you get him to tell that story
you wanted to hear?

394
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,617
All I wanted to hear was the truth.

395
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:52,371
All you wanted to do
was to close your fucking casebook.

396
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,059
So you put an idea in his head because
you knew he'd say what you wanted him to,

397
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,584
because he's impressionable.

398
00:31:58,085 --> 00:31:59,962
Well, that cuts both ways,
motherfucker.

399
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:01,547
I'm gonna check on my mother.

400
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:16,353
If you can't tamp down your
natural alpha male qualities completely,

401
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:20,399
and I doubt you can,
be a Gary to Larry Hall.

402
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:22,651
Make him feel
like you're his brother.

403
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:25,654
Always looking out for him,
never judging.

404
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:29,825
All right.

405
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:33,078
Well…

406
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:36,498
We've got a plane to catch.

407
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:38,083
What?

408
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,920
Audition's over.
You got the role.

409
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:45,507
Jimmy.

410
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:47,467
Now.

411
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:13,702
- Hey, hey.
- Marshal, how you doing?

412
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:15,120
Doing well.

413
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:18,123
How you doing?

414
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:21,793
Here.

415
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:25,088
You gotta put them back on
when we get to Springfield,

416
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:26,757
but until then, you good.

417
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:30,594
You got mad testes, dog.

418
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:32,971
Come on, you can change inside.

419
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,140
Change?

420
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,751
So you're in street clothes,
'cause you're not going in as a transfer.

421
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:56,425
Only the warden
and the chief shrink know

422
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:58,455
you're anything other than
a scumbag arms dealer

423
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:00,165
who got sentenced
to Springfield time.

424
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:03,502
You scared?

425
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:12,010
I'll get over it.

426
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:14,804
Don't.

427
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:20,101
Comfortable people get cocky,
and cocky people fuck up.

428
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:22,771
Prefer you didn't fuck up.

429
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:32,155
This recent arrest
hopefully will put an end to the fears…

430
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,157
Yeah, I'll get him to blab
in the car.

431
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:37,911
Well, it's a long drive,
flat country.

432
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:39,621
Who knows how many he'll cop to?

433
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:42,708
'Cause they don't give a shit, Pat.

434
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:45,127
They think they're dealing
with some harmless weirdo,

435
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,420
who likes confessing
to shit he didn't do.

436
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:52,426
Yeah, I'll call you
if I hear anything.

437
00:34:57,054 --> 00:35:01,018
We've apprehended a suspect in
the abduction and murder of Jessica Roach.

438
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:04,563
But through the diligence
of the officers you see behind me…

439
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:07,107
Fuck me.

440
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:09,818
…we believe
Larry DeWayne Hall may be responsible

441
00:35:09,902 --> 00:35:12,779
for the deaths
of as many as four more young women.

442
00:35:12,863 --> 00:35:15,324
Are you saying
you captured a serial killer?

443
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:25,083
No one likes Rob Roy
more than Braveheart. No one.

444
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:28,378
- That's what I keep telling him.
- It is more historically accurate.

445
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:29,796
Says who, Liam Neeson?

446
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:33,309
Edward the Longshanks did not die
on the same day as William Wallace,

447
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:35,111
and the Battle of Stirling
didn't take place...

448
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:36,512
God, it doesn't matter.

449
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:40,015
Yeah. One's a great movie,
the other stars Jessica Lange.

450
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:42,559
Hey, Jim, I need you
over here for a bit.

451
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:44,394
Sure.
Give me a minute.

452
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:46,396
No minute.
Come on.

453
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:56,823
You wanna be out of prison yesterday,
right?

454
00:35:56,907 --> 00:36:00,160
And the feeling's only gotten worse
since we dangled this carrot, correct?

455
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:03,455
Like a clock tick, tick, ticking away.
Right?

456
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,835
Don't let the clock rule you.

457
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:10,712
Don't approach Hall too early,
or he'll know we sent you for him.

458
00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:14,049
- I hear you.
- Besides the warden and Dr. Zicherman,

459
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:15,592
I'm your only other safety line.

460
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:17,803
When I visit you
treat me like your girlfriend.

461
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:20,889
Slip me tongue,
grab my ass, whatever.

462
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,977
- Grab your ass?
- Yes. Cop a feel. Do what it takes.

463
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:32,067
Should we practice now?

464
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:41,493
Hey, cool guy,
keep dicking around here.

465
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:43,453
It's just your fucking life.

466
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:47,958
If shit hits the fan,
you get to Zicherman or Warden Price,

467
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,251
and have them call me ASAP.

468
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:53,589
And, Jimmy, do not get any time
added to your sentence, understand?

469
00:36:55,257 --> 00:36:58,218
If you get time tacked to your sentence,
it supersedes our deal.

470
00:36:58,302 --> 00:37:00,053
It will be beyond our control.

471
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:01,972
You'll be stuck doing
Springfield time.

472
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,975
What if I have to defend myself?

473
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:06,894
Don't maim anyone.

474
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:08,395
And don't get caught.

475
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:29,374
Hey, Jim.

476
00:37:31,502 --> 00:37:32,753
Take care of yourself.

477
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:35,088
I thought you were coming with us.

478
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:38,342
I'll see you in a month or so.

479
00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:29,184
Yeah, I heard him
making noise in there.

480
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:30,269
Go and check him out.

481
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:52,499
Going right.

482
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,133
You two need
any more pictures with him?

483
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,595
I can hold the camera.

484
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:08,974
Here we go, Larry.

485
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:17,566
You really got nothing
to say to me, Larry?

486
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:23,572
Never struck me as the quiet type.

487
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:28,202
Seemed like the kinda guy who'd like
a good jaw session to start your day.

488
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:36,877
My mom used to say
that I could just talk paint off a wall.

489
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,380
That changed a little bit
as I got older.

490
00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:44,801
Decided to appear
like the strong, silent type.

491
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:46,220
Mostly to get laid, but...

492
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:48,907
I do enjoy having a good chat...

493
00:39:48,931 --> 00:39:52,142
You know, I kept trying to tell you
that they were just dreams.

494
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:54,436
I kept telling you,
but you kept pushing.

495
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:58,023
You forced a fake confession
out of me.

496
00:39:58,649 --> 00:39:59,983
Is that how you see it?

497
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:04,613
Who put that idea
into your head, Larry?

498
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:08,951
Now, why does everybody think I need
my ideas to come from someone else, huh?

499
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:13,163
I'm smart.
I've got ideas.

500
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:15,415
I'll bet you do.

501
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,043
I'd like to hear
about a couple of 'em.

502
00:40:18,627 --> 00:40:20,546
Maybe ones that involve girls?

503
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:24,925
Gary got me a lawyer.

504
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:27,719
So it was Gary.

505
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,847
Yeah, but...
No, but…

506
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:33,559
The lawyer said that I wasn't to say
another word to you.

507
00:40:33,642 --> 00:40:34,643
Is that right?

508
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:38,647
Well, I don't know if that lawyer
is looking out for you, in my opinion.

509
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,233
'Cause you twist
what I have to say.

510
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:43,443
We didn't twist your words, Larry.

511
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,404
You told us about your dreams.

512
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:49,408
We documented it,
and you signed a confession.

513
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:50,659
Which was coerced!

514
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:51,785
No.

515
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:53,203
The confession was coe...

516
00:40:55,914 --> 00:41:00,002
We are coming, Father Abraham
300,000 more

517
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:01,461
Hey, Larry.
Take it easy.

518
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:02,897
From Mississippi's winding stream…

519
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:04,006
Larry.

520
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:08,927
We leave our plows and workshops
Our wives and children dear

521
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:12,222
With hearts so full of utterance
With but a silent tear

522
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:13,974
Hey.
Take it easy, all right?

523
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:17,769
We are coming, Father Abraham
300,000 more

524
00:41:17,853 --> 00:41:21,481
From Mississippi's winding stream
And from New England's shore

525
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:22,733
Okay.

526
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:34,453
You got kids?

527
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:38,415
Yeah, I got a son.
He's five.

528
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:43,670
Man, loved five.
It's the perfect age.

529
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:45,214
They think you're a god.

530
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:47,341
Yeah, but now, Brittany?

531
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:50,511
Shit, she's nine, going on
"Fuck you, Daddy. You don't understand."

532
00:41:50,594 --> 00:41:53,263
Shit, I'll take that
over dirty diapers any day.

533
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:55,557
Yeah. Bigger the kid,
bigger the problem.

534
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:58,018
Yeah, says the man
who hadn't wiped an ass in a while.

535
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:02,481
What about you, you got kids?

536
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:04,816
No.

537
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:07,903
You got a wife?

538
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:11,240
- No.
- Girlfriend?

539
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:17,871
- Nothing serious.
- You a lucky man. Shit.

540
00:42:19,831 --> 00:42:21,250
Lucky man.

541
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:11,300
Look, man, I can't. I can't do this.
Let's just go back.

542
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,177
No, you can do it.

543
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,220
- Come on, bro.
- Hey, you got this.

544
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:17,222
What if Beaumont changes
his mind, huh?

545
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:19,057
Backs out?

546
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:20,434
Then I'm stuck there.

547
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:23,353
In five minutes
that shift change is gonna happen.

548
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:26,315
And that's the only time that we have
to get you in there

549
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:29,358
without setting off smoke signals
from one end of the complex to the other.

550
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:31,987
The time to do this is now.

551
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:33,655
I'm out.

552
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:34,781
Fuck.

553
00:43:34,865 --> 00:43:36,033
That's not cool, man.

554
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:38,678
That asshole
can never walk back out those doors.

555
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:40,022
You're our way to guarantee that.

556
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:41,205
Fucking look at me!

557
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:50,172
Whatever you decide to do right now,

558
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:52,216
Beaumont will never forget it.

559
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:54,801
I will never forget it.

560
00:44:00,516 --> 00:44:01,600
Final answer?

561
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:21,745
Fuck it.
Let's do it.

562
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:23,455
Yes!

563
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:24,540
My man.

564
00:44:24,623 --> 00:44:26,333
That's a good call, Jimmy. Smart.

565
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:30,921
I gotta treat you
like a scumbag again, man. Sorry.

566
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:37,386
All right, let's go.

567
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:45,060
How'd he strike you?

568
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:48,480
He didn't fill me
with an overwhelming sense of confidence.

569
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:53,235
Well, that will be moot
in about an hour.

570
00:44:54,903 --> 00:44:58,073
At trial,
Mr. Hall's entire theory of defense

571
00:44:58,156 --> 00:45:00,117
boiled down to a simple proposition.

572
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:04,413
Due to a personality disorder
that makes him susceptible to suggestion

573
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:06,874
and pathologically eager to please,

574
00:45:06,957 --> 00:45:10,961
he confessed to a crime
that he did not commit.

575
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:14,631
When Mr. Hall's attorney,
Mr. DeArmond,

576
00:45:14,715 --> 00:45:17,634
attempted to call an expert witness
in the field of false confession,

577
00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:21,054
Judge Baker refused to permit
Dr. Ofshe's testimony.

578
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:25,684
Since the verdict hinged on Mr. Hall's
state of mind during his confessions,

579
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:30,022
Dr. Ofshe's testimony would've gone
to the heart of Mr. Hall's defense.

580
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:34,359
Further,
several aspects of the confession,

581
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:39,615
Mr. Hall signing his name in block letters
when he is perfectly capable of cursive,

582
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:43,577
Mr. Hall signing a statement
over the name Larry DeWayne Daniels,

583
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,997
give further credence to
a state of mind that was suggestible.

584
00:45:47,706 --> 00:45:51,710
Further, the interrogating officer
in his initial confession

585
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:55,714
was described by fellow officers
as intimidating to Mr. Hall

586
00:45:55,797 --> 00:45:57,758
and resistant to his initial answers.

587
00:45:59,885 --> 00:46:01,929
Mr. Hall's appeal is hereby granted.

588
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:04,389
Counsel, join me in chambers.

589
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:10,395
- It's getting closer, Mom.
- Yeah.

590
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,485
What's our clock?

591
00:46:16,568 --> 00:46:17,569
A month.

592
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:20,739
And she's putting a hearing
for the second appeal on the docket.

593
00:46:20,822 --> 00:46:22,950
Oh, fuck off.
Really?

594
00:46:23,033 --> 00:46:24,993
Keene's not moot anymore.

595
00:46:25,494 --> 00:46:28,372
- We need him to step way up.
- I told him to move slowly.

596
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:30,374
If he blows the approach to Hall...

597
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:32,292
Hall spooks.
End of story.

598
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:35,212
But if he moves too slowly,
Hall walks into the free world,

599
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:38,549
buys himself another van
and a box of zip ties.

600
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:48,892
Hey, Larry.

601
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:52,521
We need you in the boiler room
as soon as you finish up.

602
00:47:16,712 --> 00:47:18,589
Looks like
they forgot about you, man.

603
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,966
Sorry about that.

604
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:25,304
Welcome to Springfield.

605
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:39,902
Empty your pockets.

606
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:51,997
All right, clothes go in there, bud.

607
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:53,582
Follow me.

608
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,640
Cough.

609
00:48:12,226 --> 00:48:13,227
Spread 'em.

610
00:48:20,025 --> 00:48:21,193
Here you go.

611
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:22,778
Follow me.

612
00:49:03,485 --> 00:49:04,653
Chow's in ten.

613
00:49:05,153 --> 00:49:06,488
Which way?

614
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:09,283
Just follow the crazy train, bud.

615
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:10,450
Hang in there.

616
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:11,785
First week's the toughest.

617
00:49:45,444 --> 00:49:46,445
How's it coming?

618
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:51,116
It's pretty fucked up.

619
00:49:52,034 --> 00:49:53,410
How long to fix?

620
00:49:55,954 --> 00:50:00,918
A machine is like a...
It's like a person, Mr. Burden.

621
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:03,754
Hygiene matters.

622
00:50:04,588 --> 00:50:07,049
And this boiler,
it was neglected for years.

623
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:10,469
That neglect has allowed
for filth to spread everywhere.

624
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:16,350
Every crevice is infected,
every valve, every locknut.

625
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:19,686
So, how long?

626
00:50:28,362 --> 00:50:30,155
Want me to bring you something
from the mess?

627
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:33,242
Yeah, just a sandwich.

628
00:50:33,325 --> 00:50:34,409
Will do.

629
00:50:34,493 --> 00:50:35,494
Thank you.

630
00:51:29,548 --> 00:51:31,884
What you mean?
Get the fuck out the way, ese.

631
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:05,417
Hey.

632
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:13,800
How can you do homework like that?

633
00:52:14,551 --> 00:52:15,719
I just can.

634
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:16,970
How?

635
00:52:17,054 --> 00:52:19,890
First time I get less than straight A's,
then it's an issue.

636
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:33,070
Brian Miller.

637
00:52:33,153 --> 00:52:35,280
How do you feel about today?
Good?

638
00:52:36,823 --> 00:52:38,867
Wouldn't be the word I'd use.

639
00:52:38,951 --> 00:52:41,995
I wanna take another look
at all the cases Hall's a suspect in,

640
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,915
but take a particularly hard look
at Roach and Reitler.

641
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:46,792
Second guess all my case work?

642
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:48,919
No, I want you to work it with me.

643
00:52:54,299 --> 00:52:56,718
- It's a Hail Mary, but...
- It's a waste of time.

644
00:52:56,802 --> 00:52:58,929
You're such a fucking pussy.

645
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:00,097
A what?

646
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:01,723
Okay.

647
00:53:02,975 --> 00:53:04,059
Work it with me.

648
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:05,894
Okay, good night, Lauren.

649
00:53:05,978 --> 00:53:07,771
No. Hey, hey.

650
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:09,940
I have a guy inside with Hall.

651
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:11,108
You what?

652
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:13,402
A guy inside.

653
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:19,575
A cop?

654
00:53:19,658 --> 00:53:21,493
No, a civilian.

655
00:53:24,538 --> 00:53:27,624
What you're doing isn't police work.
It's fucking desperation.

656
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:29,418
Good night.

657
00:53:46,643 --> 00:53:52,357
Yeah, can you connect me
to prisoner 8611167, please?

658
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:53,609
James Keene.

659
00:53:55,611 --> 00:53:57,362
What is that?
Chocolate chip?

660
00:53:57,446 --> 00:53:58,572
It's pistachio.

661
00:54:00,032 --> 00:54:01,033
Jimmy!

662
00:54:04,286 --> 00:54:05,871
I don't understand.

663
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:09,374
You have to have a record of him.
I just talked to him last night.

664
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:13,712
Well, maybe you've got the spelling wrong.
It's K-E...

665
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:17,382
Okay...

666
00:54:20,177 --> 00:54:22,346
Okay. Say he was transferred.

667
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:23,805
Wouldn't you be...

668
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:25,557
Wait a minute.

669
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,144
I gotta go to court to get it?

670
00:54:37,528 --> 00:54:38,570
He's gone.

671
00:54:39,905 --> 00:54:41,114
What?
Gone where?

672
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:45,244
That's good.
Lights out!

673
00:54:50,207 --> 00:54:51,750
All right, lockdown.

674
00:55:58,317 --> 00:55:59,359
Thanks, Larry.

675
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,111
Yeah.

676
00:57:06,343 --> 00:57:07,594
Night, Larry.
