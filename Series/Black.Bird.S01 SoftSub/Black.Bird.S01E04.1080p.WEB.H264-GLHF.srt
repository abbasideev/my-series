1
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,045
And that is why we are here today,

2
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,884
to pray for our brother
whose body lies here in rest.

3
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,679
He has passed from death to life
in the company of Lord Jesus,

4
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:22,476
who died and rose to a new life…

5
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,647
and is purified in all his faults.

6
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:34,238
And we pray God welcome him
among all the saints of heaven. Amen.

7
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,073
Amen.

8
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,061
Get up, Larry.

9
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,192
- Why can't Gary come?
- Yeah, why can't I come?

10
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,277
'Cause Gary don't wet the bed.

11
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,237
Get your ass out the door.
Come on.

12
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,442
Hey, pal.

13
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,152
Hey, Dad.

14
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,113
You still want to do this?

15
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,785
You had to work.

16
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,870
Just got off shift.

17
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,581
Aren't you tired?

18
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,500
I'm okay.

19
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,336
All right, get up.

20
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,185
There we go!
Good adjustment, Jimmy.

21
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,437
Alabama, hike!

22
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,817
We got it. I want you to turn
a little bit quicker. Okay, Jim?

23
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,861
Go long.
Turn right, go!

24
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,407
Touchdown, Jimmy Keene!

25
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,702
Elephant, six, four. Hike.

26
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,829
Set. Hike.

27
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,957
Giraffe, six, four.

28
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,424
- No.
- I got you.

29
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,474
I'm partial to Corvettes.

30
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,855
You know,
when you make it to the NFL.

31
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,027
I was thinking more like a Gremlin,

32
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,613
with the thing in the back
that lifts up?

33
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,199
Called a hatchback.

34
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,450
Yeah, one of those.

35
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,456
A Gremlin.

36
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,168
With a racing stripe, I promise.

37
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,005
Gremlin. I'll Gremlin you.

38
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:11,820
Hey, bud.

39
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,156
Hey.

40
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,240
Where were you?

41
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,912
- You know…
- No, I don't.

42
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,246
That's why I'm asking.

43
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,498
Just came back from chow.

44
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,546
So, your old man couldn't lay his hands
on any product. That right?

45
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:31,840
Unfortunately, yeah.

46
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,761
Didn't mean to block your door.

47
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,890
- No, it's fine.
- No. Come on in.

48
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,624
So you're saying
there's no money left?

49
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,044
He spent it.

50
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:13,507
Fucking guy's the gift
that keeps on giving, huh?

51
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:20,973
Guys on the outside want their money.
What am I gonna do, Jim?

52
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,017
I tried, Mr. Carter.

53
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,899
If you say that's what you did,
I gotta believe you.

54
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:34,263
Hope so.

55
00:11:34,364 --> 00:11:36,200
I just wish
we'd known each other longer.

56
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,533
Then I'd have a better sense
of your character.

57
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,704
I did everything I could.

58
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,809
Riot quiet

59
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,572
What's that?

60
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:28,540
When it's quiet like this,
they call it "riot quiet."

61
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:32,002
Like the calm before a storm.

62
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:35,797
Really?

63
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:36,882
Yeah.

64
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,386
Yeah, or it just means it's quiet.

65
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,722
Did you see anyone in here?

66
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,187
No.

67
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:53,524
Something missing?

68
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,985
Why would something be missing?

69
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,702
Well, if I was worried
someone had been in my spot,

70
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,580
I'd worry someone took something.

71
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:13,585
I'm not worried
someone was in my spot.

72
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,213
No?

73
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:17,923
Oh, no.

74
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:22,845
Then why did you ask
if I saw someone in there?

75
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,827
Why are you looking
at me like that?

76
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,416
I'm not looking at you any way.

77
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,460
Like you know me.

78
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:23,340
Larry, what the fuck?

79
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:24,883
Is that a question?

80
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:27,886
'Cause that's one thing you do.
You ask a lot of questions.

81
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:31,557
Where's this coming from?

82
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,688
That was a question.

83
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,316
Okay, Larry.

84
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:43,318
Okay, what?

85
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:48,115
I'm gonna leave you to it.
Whatever this is.

86
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,161
Wait, Jimmy.

87
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,225
When there's doubt,
there's no doubt.

88
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,563
How's that?

89
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,273
Something Gary says.

90
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:24,401
He heard it from a friend
who liberated Kuwait.

91
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,697
If you think you could be in danger…

92
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:32,951
you are in danger.

93
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:40,501
Something's gonna happen.

94
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,423
What?

95
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:49,259
I don't know, but something bad.
Don't you think?

96
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,194
Sorry about earlier.

97
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,820
I get…

98
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,199
You get what?

99
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,162
Paranoid.

100
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,373
Or whatever.

101
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,086
- You know?
- No, Larry. I don't.

102
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,050
Jimmy, I know you're upset.

103
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,635
I am not upset.

104
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,431
I just... I don't know you
from one minute to the next.

105
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,258
Hold it open.

106
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,450
Fuck you!

107
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,602
All inmates, return to your cells.

108
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:04,978
We're on lockdown.

109
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:14,863
Attention. Lockdown in progress.
Attention. Lockdown in progress.

110
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:19,326
Inmates, go to your cells!
Full lockdown.

111
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,792
89304, report to Central Command.

112
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:12,921
Jimmy?

113
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,634
Jimmy, you in there?

114
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:27,895
What's up, Larry?

115
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,775
Are you still mad at me?

116
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,617
I was never mad at you, Larry.

117
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,455
I think you were.

118
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,336
Just 'cause you think it,
don't make it so.

119
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:58,550
Yeah.

120
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:05,224
Friends? Jimmy, friends?

121
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:08,769
What?

122
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:11,939
Friends again?

123
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:30,958
Yeah.

124
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,212
Sure, Larry.

125
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:38,924
Friends.

126
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:50,269
What?

127
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:56,650
I take care of my friends.

128
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,015
Mr. Holt?

129
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:29,600
Convict Hall?

130
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:32,144
Could we lay our hands on
a hose or two, Mr. Holt?

131
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:34,313
That's a negative, Convict Hall.

132
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,357
May I ask why?

133
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:40,527
'Cause somebody could fucking strangle
someone with it, Convict.

134
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,405
Work with what you got.

135
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:49,953
Okay.
We're gonna stack the large debris first.

136
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:53,582
Anywhere you see or feel
cooking oil on the floor,

137
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:57,669
I want you to hit it with some Comet,
but don't clean it up yet.

138
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:00,130
We're gonna stack all the debris
in the east corner there.

139
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:01,215
Donny.

140
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:05,135
Donny?

141
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:10,265
Hi. I need you to sweep up the glass,

142
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:13,310
so that we can work the debris
without cutting ourselves.

143
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:15,854
I trust you with that?

144
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,272
Yes, Larry.

145
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,024
Have at it, son.

146
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:22,945
Well. Let's get to it, men.

147
00:23:25,197 --> 00:23:26,365
Grab some gloves.

148
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,500
Hey, guys. Don't forget about
the front up here, okay?

149
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:40,254
Don't worry about all the food.
We're gonna sweep that up.

150
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:41,755
Just grab the big items.

151
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:45,259
Jimmy, it's actually kind of fun,
right?

152
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:47,469
Can I have you
on this end with him?

153
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:49,054
All right, one, two, three.

154
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:51,807
It's very slippery.
There's a lot of blood. Be careful.

155
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,894
Guys, we... Gentlemen, we still have
all the cups down here.

156
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,565
Let's grab all of those cups.
How's it look down there?

157
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:00,649
It's okay.

158
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:06,321
Guys, we're going to sweep first,
and then we're going to mop.

159
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:08,615
But we need spray bottles.

160
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,036
We need putty knives.

161
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,830
They ain't giving us putty knives.

162
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:21,587
We'll find the really hard spots,
spray 'em and leave 'em for an hour.

163
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:23,964
They might come up on a sponge then.

164
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:28,760
After that, we'll get the oil up.

165
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:33,932
How'd you get into this?

166
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:37,186
Cleaning?

167
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:40,772
High school.

168
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:46,361
After school I would go work a job
at a feedstore in town.

169
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,741
And then I moved to a place
that specialized in medical supplies.

170
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:52,784
What'd you do?

171
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:55,579
In high school?

172
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,289
To support yourself, yeah.

173
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,292
Sold weed.

174
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,547
I'm not sure we had weed
in my high school.

175
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:09,176
Larry, if you were in America,
you had weed.

176
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,291
Well, Wabash was just
so innocent, though.

177
00:25:12,315 --> 00:25:14,315
It's like where Opie lived.

178
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:17,434
Mayberry.

179
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:20,687
Yeah, or, like, where Opie lived.

180
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,359
We didn't have any crime.

181
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,779
We were, like, stuck in a time warp,
you know?

182
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:35,494
Malt shops and pigtails.

183
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,084
It was Tanner's Grocer.

184
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:45,254
Everybody wore white hats.

185
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:47,673
And all the appliances
and all the food chests,

186
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:48,966
they just gleamed.

187
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,637
And Main Street, my word.

188
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,307
Just blocks of department stores
and candy stores.

189
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:58,892
Remember candy stores?

190
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:04,982
And nice people sweeping
the sidewalks,

191
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:08,235
everybody waving hello.

192
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:13,490
Our high school had
the greenest lawns.

193
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:18,704
I never saw green like that before,
or since.

194
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:25,752
And the prettiest cheerleaders
the world's ever seen.

195
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:32,467
What a world it was, James.

196
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:37,055
Even living in a cemetery.

197
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,565
You grew up in a cemetery?

198
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:50,277
Oh, yeah. Sure did.

199
00:26:50,903 --> 00:26:54,198
You'd be surprised how much fun
you can have in a place like that

200
00:26:55,699 --> 00:27:00,662
when you stop seeing the headstones
and just see fields and trees.

201
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:04,708
Never thought of it that way.

202
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:09,171
It was actually
a pretty nice way to grow up.

203
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:55,843
Happiness is a choice.
Don't you think, James?

204
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:14,778
Sometimes.

205
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:16,196
I say happiness is a choice

206
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,157
because I don't think
my parents were happy.

207
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,369
They let that grind them down.

208
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:26,415
That was hard to watch sometimes.

209
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:33,922
How about you?

210
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:42,472
I was lucky.
I had a great dad.

211
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:48,729
I never had, like, a best friend
because I always had my old man.

212
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:17,776
'Cause you're out all night.

213
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:22,114
- You're never fucking here.
- Because I fucking work.

214
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,283
- What do you think I do?
- I don't know.

215
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:26,994
What do you do, Lynne?
What do you fucking do?

216
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:28,912
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

217
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:33,584
You cock that fist,
you better use it, big man.

218
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:37,588
Tough man.
Big, tough cop can't even get it up.

219
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:40,591
That's right!

220
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,761
Break things like a fucking child.

221
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:47,389
Fuck you, Lynne!

222
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,561
Dad?

223
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,750
All that time
your old man spent with you,

224
00:31:18,023 --> 00:31:19,672
did that help?

225
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:25,344
Were you a good football player?

226
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:30,641
Best my high school
had seen in 15 years.

227
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:33,810
And that guy
got a scholarship to USC.

228
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:40,317
Sometimes you remind me
so much of Gary, my gums ache.

229
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:44,905
You both talk so big.

230
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:04,216
I lied.

231
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:07,219
You what?

232
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:08,846
I was second string.

233
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:12,933
I rode the bench, all four years.

234
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:17,604
But you still made the team.

235
00:32:17,688 --> 00:32:19,189
A lot of people made the team.

236
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:23,277
No, James, you made the team.
That's an accomplishment.

237
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:26,864
Why did you lie about it?

238
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:29,449
You know how it is.

239
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:30,784
I do not.

240
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:32,452
Come on.

241
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:34,872
Dudes try to impress other dudes

242
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:38,834
with stories that make them look bigger
than they are.

243
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:40,919
Why?

244
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:45,048
So they'll like 'em?
I don't know.

245
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,858
If you had a pet chicken,
could you eat it?

246
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:07,696
Who has a pet chicken?

247
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:11,116
I don't know.
I'd suspect some folks do.

248
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,910
And I suspect no folks do.

249
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:14,244
But if you did?

250
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:15,954
I wouldn't.

251
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,752
Well, I would. I would have one
and I would eat it.

252
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:26,673
You'd eat your pet?

253
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,801
Yeah, it's just meat.

254
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:33,597
We're all just… meat.

255
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:37,226
I would eat my pet dog.

256
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:48,195
Have you?

257
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:49,696
What?

258
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,615
Eaten your dog?

259
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:55,327
Well, we weren't allowed
to have pets growing up.

260
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:58,121
That's probably a good thing.

261
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,042
But what is the difference
between a pet and a meal?

262
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:06,922
People don't have
pet chickens or pet cows.

263
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:08,257
They have pet fish.

264
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:11,051
How is a puppy different?

265
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:14,304
Nobody plates a puppy.

266
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:21,687
"No one plates a puppy."

267
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:25,899
Hey, convicts. This isn't a date.

268
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,777
Do your job
and stop fucking goofing off.

269
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:35,826
Hey.

270
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:41,248
We weren't allowed
to have pets growing up

271
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:46,503
because my dad said that
it got in the way of real work.

272
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:53,760
We were put on God's green
to do real work.

273
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:05,772
Get to it then.

274
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:10,110
Did I stutter?

275
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:02,704
Hurry up about it.

276
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:25,310
Wait, how old were you again?

277
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:32,609
I was 14 when I started
digging graves, like, officially.

278
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:34,403
But I'd dug plenty up before then.

279
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:37,447
What's the difference?

280
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:42,202
Well, you dig a grave.
You dig up a coffin.

281
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:47,583
Why?

282
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:50,169
Why dig up…

283
00:36:50,252 --> 00:36:54,756
Well, people bury the dead
with all sorts of things they can't use.

284
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,844
Watches, shoes, money.

285
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:01,471
I remember one old gal,

286
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:05,684
she got buried
with a solid gold Siamese cat,

287
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,269
like a doorstop, you know?

288
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:10,731
She's dead,
what does she need a doorstop for?

289
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:12,983
Or a cat, or gold?

290
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:17,446
Some people are just so sick
that they would take something

291
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:19,615
that could do good in the world
for someone,

292
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:22,117
and they just hoard it
all to themselves

293
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:24,536
in a casket
six feet under the ground,

294
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,164
where it won't help nobody, James.

295
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,166
It ain't serving any kind of benefit.

296
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:34,588
You weren't scared, though?

297
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:37,925
Down in a dark hole with a...

298
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,220
You know, a corpse?

299
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:45,015
The dead are pleasant.

300
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:48,894
They don't talk down to you,
don't talk back.

301
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:51,605
They're just so peaceful.

302
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:54,969
I look into their faces,

303
00:37:54,993 --> 00:37:57,102
and it gives me hope
that the next world...

304
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,697
That the next world is gonna be
the good one.

305
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:11,124
I'll tell you something else, James.

306
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,085
No matter who a person was
in real life,

307
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:16,109
death evens it all out.

308
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:19,800
I knew a girl named Debra Kyle.

309
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:24,596
She was the... She was untouchable.

310
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,558
Kindergarten through senior year.
She went off to college.

311
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:31,186
We all thought, "She's gonna
rule the world, that one."

312
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:37,901
Then she went to college
and learned about roof jumping.

313
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:41,530
She didn't learn good,
and she fell between two buildings.

314
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:44,658
She broke her fucking neck.

315
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:53,125
She got a lot less untouchable
after that.

316
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:57,087
Like I said,

317
00:38:58,422 --> 00:38:59,715
evens it out.

318
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:23,405
Evens what out?

319
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:28,035
Whatever they thought
they were in life.

320
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:39,004
Get to it.
Come on.

321
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,668
Is your father still alive?

322
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,213
Yeah. Yours?

323
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:07,009
What does he do for work?

324
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:10,345
Fireman.

325
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:15,434
Did your mommy work?

326
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:20,564
My mother…

327
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:25,027
she owned her own bar.

328
00:41:30,324 --> 00:41:32,034
She loved everything about it.

329
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:35,996
It's a weird lifestyle.

330
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:37,728
She'd be going to work

331
00:41:37,752 --> 00:41:39,752
when most kids' moms
were making them dinner.

332
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:41,793
Come home, like,
2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.

333
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:44,796
Not what my old man
thought he was signing up for

334
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,424
when he married an Italian girl
from the neighborhood.

335
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,638
They fought a lot.

336
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,517
'Cause she was fucking guys
at the bar?

337
00:41:58,644 --> 00:41:59,895
I fucking beg your pardon?

338
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,702
He thought she was, maybe.

339
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:20,040
Either way, he didn't like her flirting,
and she loved to flirt. So…

340
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:22,042
How did you feel about her flirting?

341
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:03,834
We'll just say Lynne's a piece of work
and leave it at that.

342
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:09,923
My mom's fat.

343
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:14,845
We'll leave it at that.

344
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:30,277
Tell me something true, James.

345
00:43:32,321 --> 00:43:33,614
"Something true"?

346
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:35,157
About you.

347
00:43:36,582 --> 00:43:38,145
I've been telling you
the truth all day.

348
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:39,246
Have you?

349
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:46,752
Okay.

350
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:58,055
So my parents broke up
when I was a kid.

351
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:04,311
Then my mother,
six months later, she let him move in.

352
00:44:05,062 --> 00:44:06,313
"Him"?

353
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:07,397
Glen.

354
00:44:09,608 --> 00:44:12,986
Real scumbag.

355
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:16,714
Anyway, they'd been together
around a year

356
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:18,738
when he started hitting her.

357
00:44:20,786 --> 00:44:22,162
Would he hit you?

358
00:44:22,246 --> 00:44:23,247
All the time.

359
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:29,461
Me and my brother, but…
mostly me.

360
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,507
Anyway, she would not leave him.

361
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:35,968
I couldn't figure it out.

362
00:44:38,095 --> 00:44:42,224
And then I got it.

363
00:44:42,249 --> 00:44:46,295
She was waiting for me
to get old enough

364
00:44:46,405 --> 00:44:49,408
and strong enough
to protect her.

365
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:54,433
That wasn't fair
to put that on you.

366
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:55,737
I don't mind.

367
00:44:55,821 --> 00:45:00,284
Anyway, I started taking my Tae Kwon Do
and karate and jujitsu classes

368
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:01,910
way more seriously than I ever had.

369
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:04,413
Changed my diet, changed everything.

370
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:06,707
And pretty soon,
I could beat any kid's ass.

371
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:10,127
But, you know, I still needed to age,

372
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:14,089
to grow until I could take on
a full-grown man.

373
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:17,801
And Glen, big fucking guy.

374
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:19,928
But by the time I was 14…

375
00:45:21,597 --> 00:45:22,764
I was ready.

376
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:28,478
So, one night,
we're all in the kitchen,

377
00:45:30,314 --> 00:45:31,648
and Glen hits my mother.

378
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:36,653
Just a little flick of his fingers
back into her mouth.

379
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:40,073
And I bring it.

380
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:43,869
- You kicked his ass.
- No, Larry.

381
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:50,000
Glen paints the fucking kitchen
with me.

382
00:45:50,584 --> 00:45:51,927
He bloodied my nose,

383
00:45:51,951 --> 00:45:55,068
gave me what I'm pretty sure
was my first concussion,

384
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:58,300
and fractured three of my ribs.

385
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,762
He sends me to my room that way.

386
00:46:02,346 --> 00:46:03,680
And where was she?

387
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:14,900
She was taking a shower.

388
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:22,741
Do you know why she took a shower,
Larry?

389
00:46:25,077 --> 00:46:28,205
'Cause she wanted to smell good
when she was fucking him.

390
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:31,083
That's what she did…

391
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:34,795
with me
on the other side of the wall.

392
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:42,344
They're giggling in there,
gasping and moaning,

393
00:46:42,928 --> 00:46:44,688
with the ice cubes
rattling in their glasses.

394
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:46,098
And I gotta sit there…

395
00:46:49,142 --> 00:46:54,773
with a bloody nose and my head ringing
and my fucking ribs barking...

396
00:46:54,857 --> 00:46:57,442
That wasn't what hurt!

397
00:46:57,526 --> 00:46:59,695
All right.
Wrap it up, bitches.

398
00:47:04,074 --> 00:47:05,492
That wasn't…

399
00:47:05,576 --> 00:47:07,160
It actually hurt like hell, Larry.

400
00:47:07,244 --> 00:47:10,330
No, bones heal.

401
00:47:10,414 --> 00:47:11,790
Concussions end.

402
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:14,168
James, no.

403
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:15,627
What hurt was that…

404
00:47:17,754 --> 00:47:21,675
What hurt was that she loved him
so much more than she loved you.

405
00:47:33,896 --> 00:47:35,397
There's something else.

406
00:47:37,274 --> 00:47:40,736
No. No, there isn't.

407
00:47:43,071 --> 00:47:44,740
I want to live with Dad.

408
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:46,241
Well, you can't.

409
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:51,622
Jim…
what do you want me to say here?

410
00:47:56,663 --> 00:47:59,460
Someday, you'll be old enough
to stand up to Glen,

411
00:47:59,484 --> 00:48:00,905
but today ain't that day.

412
00:48:04,009 --> 00:48:05,449
Now I'm sorry that you got tuned up,

413
00:48:05,511 --> 00:48:08,263
but you put the quarter in the jukebox.
You gotta dance.

414
00:48:08,347 --> 00:48:09,640
I was protecting you.

415
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:11,683
This wasn't about me.

416
00:48:12,184 --> 00:48:13,727
This was about you.

417
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:16,104
And you got what you were asking for,

418
00:48:16,188 --> 00:48:18,815
but it didn't turn out the way
that you wanted it to.

419
00:48:22,528 --> 00:48:24,112
Well, there'll be other chances.

420
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:26,323
Just learn to walk
before you try and run.

421
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:29,368
- Do you want some ice or anything?
- No.

422
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:31,495
- I'll go get it for you. No problem.
- I'm fine.

423
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,125
Suit yourself, hon.

424
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:40,110
But you'll feel a lot better
in the morning

425
00:48:40,134 --> 00:48:42,134
if you put some ice on your face.

426
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:46,969
Good night.

427
00:48:48,637 --> 00:48:49,972
Night.

428
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:01,108
You ever want to hurt her?

429
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:02,609
My mother?

430
00:49:03,485 --> 00:49:04,778
Yes.

431
00:49:05,612 --> 00:49:06,989
Yeah, I wanted to hurt her.

432
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,201
Beat her?

433
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:17,749
Kill her?

434
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:22,546
Yeah,
I wanted to fucking kill her sometimes.

435
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:28,886
Did you think about how?

436
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:36,476
Chuck her down the stairs.

437
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:41,231
Although, what if she hung on
for a few minutes after?

438
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:42,316
They do that.

439
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:46,403
Particularly with neck breaks.

440
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,368
All right, convicts.
Feet on the line.

441
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:59,708
Could you do things to her then?

442
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:06,715
What things?

443
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:13,388
Things.

444
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:17,059
To my mother?

445
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:21,939
Well, to anyone.

446
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:29,154
I don't understand.

447
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:42,751
I soak a rag in starter fluid
and put it in a Mason jar in my van.

448
00:50:48,674 --> 00:50:51,760
If you put it over a person's face…

449
00:50:56,515 --> 00:50:58,976
they're out in seconds.

450
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:01,770
Nothing to it.

451
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:15,784
I gotta figure it's a lot more pleasant
than being thrown down a flight of stairs.

452
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:22,958
Forget stairs.

453
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:27,337
Why would you do that, Larry?

454
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:33,218
So they'll stop hitting me.

455
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:40,100
"They"?

456
00:51:44,396 --> 00:51:45,814
Girls, you know.

457
00:51:49,484 --> 00:51:50,485
What girls?

458
00:51:52,487 --> 00:51:53,822
Girls I meet.

459
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:08,587
What do you do with girls you meet?

460
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,480
I like you almost
as much as you like you.

461
00:52:28,899 --> 00:52:29,900
That's good.

462
00:52:57,135 --> 00:52:58,387
Cheers.

463
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:18,949
Yeah.

464
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,168
So, what's next?

465
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:49,897
Jimmy.

466
00:53:53,942 --> 00:53:54,943
Yeah?

467
00:53:56,278 --> 00:53:57,821
Today was real fun.

468
00:54:01,074 --> 00:54:02,201
Yeah, it was.

469
00:54:07,706 --> 00:54:08,749
Good night.

470
00:54:11,293 --> 00:54:12,461
Good night, Larry.

471
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:03,387
What's that?

472
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:05,848
Birds. They're watching.

473
00:55:07,266 --> 00:55:08,475
Owls?

474
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,728
Falcons. They watch over the dead.

475
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:14,022
Falcons do that?

476
00:55:14,106 --> 00:55:16,984
Some do.
Now, get back to work now.

477
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:27,911
Fuck you doing, boy?

478
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:32,916
Come on.

479
00:55:34,126 --> 00:55:35,127
Got it.

480
00:55:52,269 --> 00:55:53,604
Mine now.

481
00:55:59,902 --> 00:56:01,653
How long did it last?

482
00:56:01,737 --> 00:56:02,988
A few hours.

483
00:56:03,906 --> 00:56:04,990
Were you scared?

484
00:56:05,073 --> 00:56:08,702
For sure, yeah.
It's, like, barbaric.

485
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:11,580
Riots are barbaric.

486
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,171
Well, you look good.
You put on some weight.

487
00:56:20,005 --> 00:56:21,340
Do I look fat?

488
00:56:21,423 --> 00:56:23,091
No, you needed to gain a few.

489
00:56:24,343 --> 00:56:25,761
You look good, I said.

490
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:27,804
Girls don't like fat guys.

491
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:31,225
Are you runnin' into a lot of girls
in here?

492
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:34,144
I mean, once I'm out.

493
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:42,986
Hey, Gar, what was the name of that girl
we picked up?

494
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:45,781
To California?
That one?

495
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:47,407
On the road trip.

496
00:56:47,908 --> 00:56:49,993
I don't remember her name.
That was a long time ago.

497
00:56:50,077 --> 00:56:51,620
No, it was...

498
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:54,623
I think it was Lois.

499
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:57,709
Wasn't Lois.

500
00:56:59,545 --> 00:57:01,755
Or Louise.

501
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:03,090
It wasn't fucking Louise.

502
00:57:06,927 --> 00:57:08,136
Donna.

503
00:57:08,637 --> 00:57:11,807
It wasn't Lois or Louise or Donna.
We never knew her name.

504
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,559
We didn't?
I'm sure we did.

505
00:57:13,642 --> 00:57:15,602
Larry, she was some chick
that we picked up.

506
00:57:15,686 --> 00:57:17,412
The next morning,
she headed out with that biker

507
00:57:17,437 --> 00:57:18,790
who had that puke-green Harley.

508
00:57:18,814 --> 00:57:20,094
That was the last we saw of her.

509
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:22,860
Now I remember.

510
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:26,238
Wanda?

511
00:57:31,618 --> 00:57:33,203
Police dropped by the house.

512
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,915
- The... When?
- Couple days back.

513
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:40,836
- Which ones?
- Local. Wabash.

514
00:57:43,797 --> 00:57:45,174
What'd they want?

515
00:57:45,257 --> 00:57:46,341
They didn't say.

516
00:57:46,842 --> 00:57:50,888
They just sort
of talked around things.

517
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:54,725
But they wanted to make it clear
they didn't forget you, Larry.

518
00:57:55,225 --> 00:57:56,393
That's the point here.

519
00:57:57,144 --> 00:57:59,584
They got you in their sights,
and they ain't planning to stop.

520
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:02,816
- Why?
- You embarrassed them.

521
00:58:17,497 --> 00:58:18,498
Sharon.

522
00:58:23,754 --> 00:58:26,632
Yeah. That was it.

523
00:58:28,383 --> 00:58:30,010
You know what, Gary?
You know something?

524
00:58:30,093 --> 00:58:33,222
If they're coming around now
trying to make me feel like

525
00:58:33,305 --> 00:58:36,308
they're gonna be all over me
when I get out,

526
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:37,809
I mean, that's…

527
00:58:38,477 --> 00:58:40,437
It means they think
you're gonna get out.

528
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:42,231
Yeah.
