1
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,425
Nice!

2
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:42,060
My old man used to say
he wanted me to better myself.

3
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,187
I love you.

4
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:47,191
But I could see in his eyes
he didn't.

5
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,652
"Better myself."

6
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,573
- No.
- I got you.

7
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,992
Nice, Jimmy.
Way to get off the line.

8
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,368
Attaboy!

9
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,955
Gremlin.

10
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,791
You know
what they never tell you?

11
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,669
They don't tell you
that the love of your life…

12
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,590
could be your child.

13
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,347
Are you a threat to the mental health
of any of my patients?

14
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,642
Are you a threat?

15
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,561
Hi. Where are you heading off to?

16
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,564
Just gonna go home.

17
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,149
You can't. You promised.

18
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,692
I never promised anything.

19
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:31,777
You did.

20
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:34,738
You did.

21
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,033
You promised.

22
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,082
Hey, James.

23
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,166
What?

24
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,382
James.

25
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,469
Hey, James.

26
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,012
James.

27
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,690
You were having some dream.

28
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,194
Did I say anything?

29
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:17,614
No. But it did make me think
that my stories yesterday

30
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,700
may have given you some nightmares.

31
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:25,873
Stories?

32
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,544
That's what they are.

33
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,046
Sometimes I do that.

34
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,799
Lie to your friends?

35
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,259
Huh?

36
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,387
What? No.

37
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,014
Well, you just said you lied to me.

38
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,898
So either you lie to your friends,

39
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:54,359
or you lie to people
who aren't your friends,

40
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:57,905
which pretty much tells me
where I stand either way.

41
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,115
That's not it.

42
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,576
Okay.

43
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,704
All right…

44
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:07,831
All right, look, it's...

45
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:11,251
Relax, Larry.
I'm not surprised.

46
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,428
What are you saying?

47
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:26,141
I guess if I'd given it more thought,
I would have realized you were lying.

48
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:29,853
It's not lying. It's storytelling.
I'm not a liar. I'm a raconteur.

49
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,855
Look, whatever.

50
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,733
Your details were off,
and God's in the details.

51
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,281
Okay. What "details?"

52
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,619
- You said you grew up digging graves.
- I did.

53
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:49,498
Yet you didn't dig
one for Jessica Roach.

54
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,252
See?

55
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:56,494
That's how I know
you're full of shit.

56
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:05,180
Then you would know
that you need to dig a grave

57
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,850
in the right kind of soil.

58
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,226
Yeah.

59
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,812
And it's hard to find in the dark.

60
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,021
Of course.

61
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:17,484
And this man, he pulled up
on the road across from my van.

62
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,820
Yeah, that guy.
He keeps showing up.

63
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,910
I meant to go back.

64
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,871
I just didn't have the time to do it.

65
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:32,165
Larry. It's okay.

66
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,212
- It's not.
- It's fine.

67
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:41,008
Everybody in here tells stories.
I tell everybody I played for OSU...

68
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,134
It's not!

69
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,638
I...

70
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,190
I'm telling the truth.

71
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,443
You just said it was a story.

72
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,236
That was the lie.

73
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,487
That was?

74
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,572
Yeah.

75
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:13,040
I'm not lying, James.

76
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,511
You're not a killer, man.

77
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,012
I am.

78
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,848
I've looked into the eyes of a few.

79
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,061
And you don't have those eyes.

80
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,611
What eyes do I have?

81
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:46,907
A wannabe's.

82
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,250
- Meet me in the woodshop later.
- Why?

83
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,673
I wanna show you
what kind of eyes I have.

84
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,426
Chow, maggots.

85
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,045
Shut the fuck up!

86
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,589
You could always request PC.

87
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,105
Might as well open up, Jim.

88
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,160
Mind if I come in?

89
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,954
I'd rather come out.

90
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,342
Where's your girlfriend?

91
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,220
Is he the one you're
supposed to rat on?

92
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,057
Cause I would support that.

93
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,158
A kid killer?

94
00:09:21,182 --> 00:09:24,103
 You kidding me, Jim?
I would have your back on that.

95
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,401
- Yeah?
- I'd be your true blue, bud.

96
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:31,738
What would it cost me?

97
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:33,657
Nothing.

98
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,410
Really.

99
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,620
Some things are bigger than us

100
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:41,874
and we can all agree
that motherfucker has to get got.

101
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,424
So who would we be working for?

102
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,722
You mean who am I working for?

103
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:03,228
Yes, but we'd be in this together.

104
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:07,524
And maybe, if I did good,
it would be like an audition for me.

105
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,610
And I can get a job
with the Marshals.

106
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:15,032
Well, if I was working
for the Marshals, maybe.

107
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,408
So who you working for?

108
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,415
I tell you what, Mr. Carter.

109
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,499
What?

110
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,836
You call off the dogs for a week...

111
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,923
Why would I do that, Jim?

112
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,678
- So I know you can.
- And you'll do what?

113
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,227
- Tell you who I'm working for.
- So, tell me.

114
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:47,314
A week from now.
If I'm still walking upright.

115
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,109
That's not…

116
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,321
That's not how our relationship works,
Jim.

117
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,323
I don't think
you can call anyone off.

118
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,908
How you gonna call me off you?

119
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,998
Well,
you fucked with my phone calls.

120
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,752
And you already put
a snitch jacket on me.

121
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,258
What else you gonna do?

122
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,469
- You don't wanna find that out.
- Yeah.

123
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,141
I do.

124
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,109
Okay then.

125
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,444
Enjoy your day.

126
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:37,531
Savor it.

127
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,915
- I was on the phone.
- Yep.

128
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,084
On hold for three fucking hours.

129
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,544
Three hour...

130
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:55,507
I didn't even know that
if it's breakfast or lunch anymore.

131
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:56,717
It's lunch.

132
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,386
And all...

133
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:01,305
Here you go.

134
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:06,602
All to tell me to call back tomorrow
to talk to the one guy,

135
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:11,231
the one guy who can let me know
why Jimmy's funds were frozen.

136
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:13,817
Well, you know,
maybe you could drive out there again

137
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,527
and sit and stare at the prison.

138
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:16,820
Come on. Stop.

139
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,781
This is fucking serious.

140
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,491
I know.
What are you having?

141
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,622
A churger.

142
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:31,210
- What?
- The cheeserburger.

143
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,503
No, you said "churger."

144
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:35,839
- I did?
- Yeah.

145
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:38,592
Hi, folks.
Can I get you something to start?

146
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:42,179
Hi. Yeah. I'll have ice tea.

147
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,263
Hon?

148
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:48,894
A coff of cuppee, and a churger.

149
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,523
The... I don't know,
the cheese... Fuck.

150
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,650
Call 911. He's having a stroke.

151
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:55,901
- Oh, God.
- What?

152
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,611
- 911.
- Okay.

153
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:58,695
Okay.

154
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,948
It's okay. Okay.

155
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:02,699
Oh, God.

156
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:04,993
911!

157
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:37,484
Good friend of mine
got the pancreatic cancer.

158
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,947
Doctor said he'd be
dead in four months.

159
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:50,372
A week later he slipped walking up
some icy steps of a church, mind you,

160
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,333
and hit his fucking head.

161
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:59,590
Died right there in front
of his wife, one of his kids.

162
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,553
Know what his last words were

163
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:09,683
before he bled out all over the steps
of St. Augustine's?

164
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:24,364
"You just… never fucking know."

165
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,249
How'd you get in here?

166
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,002
Door was open.

167
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,634
What you working on?

168
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,435
James.

169
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:21,732
I finished them.

170
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:30,324
Twenty-one? Why?

171
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,119
Because I like to carve.

172
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,041
No. Why 21?

173
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,336
Why not 20 or an even two dozen?

174
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,720
Like, I carve well.
See?

175
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,896
It's too bad I don't paint well.

176
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,107
I'll leave that to Gary.

177
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,319
Gary paints them black.

178
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:10,948
Blacker than any
black you've ever seen.

179
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:14,701
Shipping these to Gary?

180
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,871
Home, yeah.

181
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,836
Do you know what they're for, James?

182
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,339
No.

183
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,303
They watch over the dead.

184
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,185
They guard their spirits

185
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,688
to make sure they're okay.

186
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,573
These are the eyes
you wanted me to see?

187
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,158
Well, there's these too.

188
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:00,497
Right.

189
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,209
You know, James.

190
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,214
You thinking that I was a liar,

191
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:12,718
that made me sick to my stomach.

192
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:17,806
Because then maybe you'd think
that I don't take what I do seriously.

193
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:22,644
There's a care
that should be taken.

194
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:26,732
That's what I'm saying.
It shouldn't be casual.

195
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:32,779
You know, not like your 80 women
you've been with.

196
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:35,032
No. I'm sorry to say,

197
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:38,452
but you probably don't remember
some of their names.

198
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:44,249
Maybe their body parts start to blur.

199
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:47,920
Am I wrong?

200
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,549
It was just sex, Larry.

201
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,219
It's never just sex.

202
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,137
Never just anything.

203
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:02,226
Every interaction you have
with a person means something.

204
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,269
We... That's what we owe to the…

205
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:07,356
to the world.

206
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,440
To history.

207
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,526
Sometimes it's just sex.

208
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:11,610
No.

209
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,632
If every interaction
with another person had the same weight

210
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,575
we'd all go insane, Larry.

211
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,413
No. You fucking hear me?

212
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:24,998
No.

213
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,876
Shut the fuck up and listen to me.

214
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:30,879
We are part of something.

215
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:36,093
I am a part of something.

216
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,972
When I folded those clothes,

217
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:44,309
that was an act of kindness from a…

218
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,187
a deity.

219
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,191
Whose clothes?

220
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,903
Who are we talking about?

221
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,201
Tricia Reitler's.

222
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,415
Everyone was looking for her.

223
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,834
They still are.

224
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,129
She got in your van too?

225
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:20,804
She was a handful.

226
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,640
She punched like a man.

227
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,019
And I didn't wanna stab her, James.

228
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:31,273
I didn't stab her…
because I was going to stab her.

229
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,692
I stabbed her
to stop her from hitting me. Man.

230
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:39,781
But that didn't work.

231
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,076
She just kept on trying to hurt me.

232
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:46,538
I had to choke her.

233
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,460
You stabbed her and choked her?

234
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,754
Such a nasty fucking girl.

235
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:57,925
I must have passed out. When I
woke up, there she was lying there.

236
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,134
Naked and all.

237
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,763
No pulse.

238
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:08,435
But to your point,
James. To your point…

239
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:15,150
I did dig her grave.

240
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,736
I know you made fun of me earlier.

241
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:22,616
But I've dug hundreds of graves
since I was a child.

242
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:27,162
Probably more than you've had women.

243
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:31,542
I'm serious. I have
dug more than you've…

244
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,131
Was that 80?

245
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,681
I've dug more than you've fucked.

246
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:50,394
I've dug in the cold.
I've dug in the boiling heat.

247
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:54,898
I've dug in the rainfall.

248
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,027
It turned the soil into oatmeal.

249
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:01,655
I know a good grave.

250
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:03,949
I do, James.

251
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,201
And Tricia's was one of the best
I ever did.

252
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:07,911
No one will ever find that one.

253
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,668
But you know where it is.

254
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,505
I know where all of them are.

255
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:24,469
Everybody wants the same thing
in this life.

256
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:30,392
To be seen.

257
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:38,525
Well, I see them, James.

258
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,110
I give them that.

259
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:45,199
And so long as my life continues on,
theirs has meaning.

260
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,244
It has...

261
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,206
Five minutes, guys.

262
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,052
You could do more.

263
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:08,430
I don't follow.

264
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:15,437
You could give them peace,

265
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:18,106
their families anyway.

266
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,401
You could give them the map.

267
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:25,697
The map?

268
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,407
Yeah.

269
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:31,370
But why?

270
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:36,542
So they could sleep.

271
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:39,628
Bury their dead.

272
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:43,382
If you've given them their peace,

273
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:48,053
and you've given the daughters your…

274
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:50,430
Your...

275
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:53,684
If I give them my seeing...
my witness.

276
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:58,397
Then everything will be okay.

277
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,692
Everything is okay.
Everything is bliss.

278
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:06,655
If you've given them your seeing

279
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:10,367
then the parents would have the...

280
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,662
The knowing of where their girls are.

281
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,498
They could move on.

282
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,169
James, you're not thinking clearly.

283
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:22,546
If I did that,
then I would never get out of here.

284
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:24,798
You could.

285
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:28,302
What if someone could send the...

286
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:32,347
The locations of the girls
to the authorities, like, anonymously?

287
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,143
Why?

288
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:37,644
They just did.

289
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:41,899
Then the families would know.
They would have that.

290
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:48,030
But why should they have that?

291
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:53,577
Because they're probably hurting
pretty bad, Larry.

292
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,632
James!

293
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:10,010
James.

294
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,638
You're fucking with me.
You're always fucking with me.

295
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:13,972
Just like Gary.

296
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:16,099
Oh, my God.

297
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:21,647
You gotta give these
people some release.

298
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,026
What did you say? Say that again?

299
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,784
Give these people some release.

300
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:39,289
Never.

301
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:41,834
Why?

302
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:50,342
Because, James,
I'm going to win my appeal.

303
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:56,348
And I'm going walk right out those
doors and keep on living my life.

304
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:12,656
You're not gonna win your appeal.

305
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:23,834
No fucking way!

306
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:33,844
James, why are you acting...

307
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:35,429
You'll never get out of here.

308
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:39,308
You kill children
who cry for their mothers.

309
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:44,479
You demented fucking monster!

310
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,569
Beaumont sent you, didn't he?

311
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:55,782
He did, didn't he?

312
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:01,788
- Beaumont, sent you!
- Guard!

313
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:04,124
Beaumont sent you.

314
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,877
Beaumont sent you, didn't he?

315
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,670
- Hey!
- You fuck!

316
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,382
- Fuck you!
- Break it up!

317
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:15,260
You cunt fucking whore!

318
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:18,138
Beaumont sent you!
Fuck you!

319
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:19,806
Go fuck your mother!

320
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,851
I know you've already
fucking thought about it!

321
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:24,811
- Settle down!
- Fuck!

322
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:43,956
I need to talk to Dr. Zicherman.

323
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:47,000
No, tonight.

324
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:49,336
Ain't happening.

325
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:51,547
How about a phone
call? Just a quick one.

326
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,716
Phone call?
Convict, please.

327
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,510
Ain't no phone call happening either.

328
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:58,345
Please.

329
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:02,307
Look, I'll hook you up
in the morning. All right?

330
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,393
Thank you.

331
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:25,766
- No. I need Dr. Zicherman.
- Calm down.

332
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:27,643
- Get me Dr. Zich... No!
- Come on.

333
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:30,437
His number is 6-1-2-5-7-1-1.

334
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:33,482
His number is 6-1-2-5-7-1-1.

335
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:36,318
That's it! That's
all I need. That's it!

336
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:39,238
6-1-2-5-7-1-1.

337
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:41,949
No. Okay. Just let
me talk to the warden.

338
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:45,494
- Let me talk to the fucking warden!
- Shut the fuck up!

339
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:47,246
- Shut the fuck up!
- No!

340
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:48,330
Get in.

341
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,502
No!

342
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:58,966
Hey. I just need a pencil.

343
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:02,219
If you want another blanket,
another pillow, more toilet paper,

344
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:05,097
you gotta do us a huge favor
and shut the fuck up, Convict.

345
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:06,890
No, I...

346
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:06,366
I need a pen. A pencil.
A fucking crayon, anything!

347
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,659
Come back, please!

348
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:09,536
Please, come back!

349
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:24,801
If I could just use a pencil.

350
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:27,012
You can even stand here with me
while I use...

351
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:09,221
Bodily fluids, they all...

352
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:13,851
They all serve, like, a different
function, every one of them.

353
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:18,856
Like, saliva has one purpose,
and blood another.

354
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:57,996
He do that all day?

355
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,791
Depends.

356
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:04,169
That much to burn, huh?

357
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:08,047
Sometimes, yeah.
Just scrub, lots of dead flowers.

358
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:10,543
Mostly, though,
he's just in the habit.

359
00:34:10,555 --> 00:34:12,511
Likes staring into
the fire, drinking.

360
00:34:16,098 --> 00:34:17,349
We met a few years ago.

361
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:18,809
- I remember.
- Yeah.

362
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:19,935
Remember her too.

363
00:34:22,855 --> 00:34:23,856
Brian Miller.

364
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:29,820
Lauren McCauley, FBI.
I didn't think you lived here anymore.

365
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:31,697
I don't.

366
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,407
Come back to help out
now and again.

367
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:36,326
You do something
different with your hair?

368
00:34:37,703 --> 00:34:38,704
No.

369
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:40,163
Color it? Nothing?

370
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:41,998
Nope.

371
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:45,960
You look good.

372
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,424
That's nice of you to say, Gary.
Maybe we could all talk inside?

373
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:52,967
You got a warrant?

374
00:34:57,514 --> 00:34:58,765
Then enjoy the fresh air.

375
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:25,626
Got manners around here.

376
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:37,554
Thanks.

377
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:39,223
You're welcome.

378
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,356
You already got him locked up
the rest of his life.

379
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:49,691
Not if he makes his appeal.

380
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:50,776
Yeah.

381
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:54,196
Well, you ain't never had shit on him
but a lot of conjecture.

382
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:55,948
No, we got two confessions.

383
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:58,534
Yeah, "coerced" was the word
his lawyer used.

384
00:35:58,617 --> 00:36:00,553
One court's agreed.
You wouldn't be here bothering us

385
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:02,847
if you didn't think his second appeal's
gonna go the same way.

386
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:04,289
And then he'll be back home.

387
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:09,461
Yeah.

388
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:11,171
Up to his old tricks.

389
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:16,552
He'll get his old job
back and be fine.

390
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:21,473
Yeah. Maybe meet a nice girl,
settle down, raise a family.

391
00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:22,558
Hey.

392
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:25,477
- What?
- Just don't.

393
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:27,361
- Don't what?
- Don't make fun of me and mine.

394
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:30,691
- No one's making fun of you, Gary.
- No, sure you are. Talking shit.

395
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:33,110
"Larry's gonna live a normal life.
Have a wife and kids."

396
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:34,945
What makes you think he won't?

397
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:39,616
Yeah, you want me to say

398
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,970
because my brother ain't capable
of having a normal home life,

399
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:43,245
that means he kills people?

400
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:44,997
Well, does he?

401
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:49,334
Look, Larry's done
some terrible things, sure. Who hasn't?

402
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:52,004
But he ain't never killed no one.

403
00:36:52,546 --> 00:36:56,258
He's just so desperate
someone see him once in his life.

404
00:36:57,593 --> 00:36:58,927
See him as a what?

405
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:00,012
A person.

406
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:03,807
Someone who can be funny,
smart, fucking helpful to people.

407
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:10,898
I know you love your brother, Gary,
but he killed those girls.

408
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:11,857
No.

409
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,192
I think you know that.

410
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:42,387
That's for you.

411
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:45,182
These, mine.

412
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:49,019
He's the person in those pictures,
not some beast.

413
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:52,940
Go on, look through it.

414
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:05,619
You've been quiet.
We reward quiet.

415
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:09,957
You need anything? Anything at all?

416
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:13,669
But don't say a pencil.

417
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:27,516
I'm not crazy
like some of the people in here.

418
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:30,477
You never struck me that way.

419
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:34,022
I was sent here
to get a confession from Inmate Hall.

420
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:36,066
What kind of confession?

421
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,026
He kills girls.

422
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,404
I was sent here to find out
where he buries them,

423
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:42,948
and I saw a map and I...

424
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:45,284
- Who sent you to do this?
- The FBI.

425
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:46,869
- The FBI.
- Yes.

426
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:48,996
- I have to get a message to them.
- To the FBI?

427
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,455
Yes.

428
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:52,749
Before I can't remember
where the bodies are.

429
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:55,836
Before I can't help the parents.

430
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:00,883
Before I'm no use.

431
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:04,720
- Your name's Jim, right?
- Yes, Jimmy.

432
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:06,847
- Yes.
- Jimmy.

433
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:12,227
Don't you ever say "FBI" to me again.
You hear me?

434
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:17,733
- Fucking answer me.
- Yes, I hear you.

435
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:24,072
Like you guys
in these soapbox cars you made.

436
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:25,199
What are you, 12?

437
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:26,283
Eleven.

438
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:28,867
Yeah, Larry made those.

439
00:39:28,891 --> 00:39:32,281
Man's a magician
with anything mechanical.

440
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:37,586
Where'd your dad go?

441
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:42,216
Fuck knows.
Wandering, drinking.

442
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:46,261
Pinching a watch off a corpse.
Shit like that.

443
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:48,430
Your mom?
She still with us?

444
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:49,806
Yeah, she's inside.

445
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,684
Gotta...
Can't get around much no more.

446
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:57,439
She got the bed and the Barcalounger
and a toilet in the same room.

447
00:39:58,774 --> 00:40:00,234
Works for her.

448
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:01,318
Sick?

449
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:03,028
Fat.

450
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:10,035
What "terrible things?"

451
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:13,956
You said, "We've all done
terrible things, even Larry."

452
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:15,874
I was just wondering
what those things were.

453
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:17,798
What? So you can arrest
him for something else?

454
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:19,419
No, I was just wondering, Gary.

455
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:22,756
You ain't never done nothing terrible
in your life? You above all that?

456
00:40:24,424 --> 00:40:26,150
You weren't talking
about general things

457
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,174
I could have done, Gary.

458
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:32,266
You were talking about
a specific thing Larry did.

459
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:35,853
No.

460
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:49,491
Picked up this hitchhiker once.

461
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:54,121
Was years ago.
Ten, 15, something like that.

462
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:59,161
Anyway, she got drunk, you know?

463
00:40:59,656 --> 00:41:03,015
And I wanted her to take
Larry's cherry.

464
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,841
So, yeah.

465
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:08,302
When she was feeling no pain,

466
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:12,097
I… fooled around
with her a little bit,

467
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:15,601
and then Larry took his turn.

468
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:19,229
Yeah. So, we were sharing this tent

469
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:21,732
because we had a reenactment nearby
the next day.

470
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:25,777
Anyway, I was too fucked up
to leave the tent,

471
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:29,448
so I just figured I'd pass out before
Larry really started getting into it.

472
00:41:33,274 --> 00:41:34,107
You know,

473
00:41:34,264 --> 00:41:37,223
sometimes a girl says "no"
but her body's saying "yes"?

474
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:38,832
You know, man.
You know how it is?

475
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:42,970
But with Larry,

476
00:41:42,994 --> 00:41:46,407
when this girl said "no,"
she goddamn meant it.

477
00:41:48,217 --> 00:41:49,847
And I see him

478
00:41:49,871 --> 00:41:53,141
over on his side of the tent
with her,

479
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:58,644
and he looks like
some kind of wolf.

480
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:03,023
You know, like he might actually
rip her throat out with his teeth.

481
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:07,611
Instead, he…

482
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:11,031
hit her a bunch of times.

483
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,116
Choked her a bit.

484
00:42:13,825 --> 00:42:15,619
Like, spit on her.

485
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:20,832
Called her a bunch of
names until he came.

486
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:26,421
What were you doing during all this?

487
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:31,301
I was, like, in shock.
You know?

488
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:35,180
And she's lying there afterwards,

489
00:42:35,264 --> 00:42:37,391
and I see this look
Larry gets in his eyes.

490
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:39,309
What kind of look?

491
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:40,686
Kind you never wanna see.

492
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,150
And I said, "Don't."

493
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:49,152
Larry looked at me and...

494
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:51,130
He knew what I was saying.
I knew what I was saying.

495
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:54,116
That poor girl, she fucking knew.

496
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:06,670
Eventually Larry passed out.

497
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:12,217
I sat up the rest of the night,

498
00:43:12,301 --> 00:43:14,761
in case he woke up
with that idea still in his head.

499
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:24,396
But he just kept
sleeping, snoring away.

500
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,902
Next morning,
the girl went out with some biker.

501
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,616
You know, I always
felt like I fucked up.

502
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:41,205
I introduced him to, you know,
sex in the wrong way,

503
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:43,123
with the wrong woman.
So, I…

504
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:45,792
So maybe that's why
he got a taste for killing them?

505
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:50,881
That one thing
didn't make your brother a killer.

506
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:53,634
- I never said he was a killer.
- But you knew.

507
00:43:53,717 --> 00:43:54,927
I don't. I didn't.

508
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,094
You've always known.

509
00:44:09,733 --> 00:44:10,734
Gary.

510
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:14,947
Gary.

511
00:44:20,202 --> 00:44:21,578
If your brother gets out,

512
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,830
and he moves back in here,

513
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:26,542
and he gets his old job back,

514
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:29,002
and life goes back to the way it was…

515
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:37,052
are you gonna be able to stay up
every night for the rest of your life

516
00:44:37,135 --> 00:44:39,805
to make sure your brother stays
where you can see him?

517
00:45:20,053 --> 00:45:22,097
Hey, Jimmy.
Come on.

518
00:45:22,181 --> 00:45:23,265
Come on.
Need help here.

519
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:25,976
Come on.
There you go.

520
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:29,791
They were supposed
to tell me, Jimmy.

521
00:45:29,803 --> 00:45:30,355
What?

522
00:45:30,439 --> 00:45:33,442
While I was on vacation. If you asked
for me, they were supposed to tell me.

523
00:45:33,525 --> 00:45:34,526
I need a pen.

524
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:37,738
Okay. Listen, Dr. Hackett's actions
will be subject to review...

525
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:39,781
- That doesn't matter. I need a pen!
- Okay.

526
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:42,576
- Jimmy, we're gonna make this right.
- I need a pen.

527
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:47,039
I'll get some paper.

528
00:46:53,856 --> 00:46:55,107
What are the dots?

529
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,985
The bodies.

530
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:01,113
Okay?

531
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:04,992
They're the bodies.
There were 21.

532
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:06,743
- He had a map.
- Hall had a map?

533
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:09,830
Of all his dead. I saw it.
This is it, but this is shit.

534
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:11,123
Okay.

535
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:12,708
Jimmy.

536
00:47:16,461 --> 00:47:17,963
We'll work this map, Jimmy.

537
00:47:19,131 --> 00:47:20,757
We'll see what we can do.

538
00:47:21,341 --> 00:47:22,342
It'll help.

539
00:47:31,226 --> 00:47:32,477
He used two belts.

540
00:47:38,942 --> 00:47:39,943
What?

541
00:47:45,866 --> 00:47:49,286
On Jessica Roach. He used two belts
buckled together to strangle her.

542
00:47:55,584 --> 00:47:56,752
He told you that?

543
00:48:00,172 --> 00:48:01,256
In detail.

544
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:07,846
What else he tell you?

545
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:17,648
Told me he folded Tricia Reitler's
clothes and placed her earring on top.

546
00:48:25,614 --> 00:48:26,990
Then we got him, Jimmy.

547
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:30,160
You got him.

548
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:07,948
Mr. Keene, when last you stood
before this court,

549
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:10,117
you carried an air of entitlement.

550
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:12,160
You actually wore it

551
00:49:12,244 --> 00:49:15,539
like someone would wear
their clothes or their skin.

552
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,250
Where'd it go, son?

553
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,211
I don't know, Your Honor.

554
00:49:23,714 --> 00:49:26,800
Well, judging by the brief
presented to me by Mr. Beaumont,

555
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:28,594
I would venture
that you left it behind

556
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:31,889
in that hell that you entered
on behalf of this case.

557
00:49:36,268 --> 00:49:38,312
Mr. Keene, the court hereby
commutes your sentence

558
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:40,898
of 120 months for
narcotics trafficking.

559
00:49:40,981 --> 00:49:43,275
This commutation is
full without conditions,

560
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:44,902
and effective immediately.

561
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:49,281
You're a free man, Mr. Keene.

562
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:02,711
Thank you.

563
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:16,517
I didn't get the bodies for you.

564
00:50:18,894 --> 00:50:20,062
You did plenty.

565
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:26,360
Hey, Jimmy.
I'd like you to meet somebody.

566
00:50:27,945 --> 00:50:29,154
Brian Miller, Jim.

567
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:33,575
You got the first confession.

568
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:35,869
You found…

569
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:40,541
Jessica Roach.
Yes, I did.

570
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:42,793
- Jessica.
- Yeah.

571
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:44,378
Yeah.

572
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:47,714
I just wanted to thank you
for what you did.

573
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:54,429
Never found out where they're buried.

574
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,391
You made sure he won't bury any more.

575
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:11,989
The petitioner's claim
that the confessions were coerced,

576
00:51:12,072 --> 00:51:14,074
and further, that
the petitioner himself

577
00:51:14,157 --> 00:51:17,286
had not the mental capacity
to understand the charges,

578
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:19,371
does not bear up to scrutiny.

579
00:51:20,956 --> 00:51:22,541
Further, the respondent,

580
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:25,836
working within the boundaries
of the existing cases and evidence,

581
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:29,381
has produced further sourcing
which confirms the petitioner knew

582
00:51:29,464 --> 00:51:31,884
details of the crimes
to which he confessed

583
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:35,596
that only the actual perpetrator
could know.

584
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:39,016
It is the decision of this court

585
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:41,310
that the ruling
of the criminal court stand.

586
00:51:41,894 --> 00:51:44,313
The petitioner's
appeal is hereby denied.

587
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:46,815
Bailiffs, please remove the prisoner

588
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:49,943
and return him immediately
to where he belongs.

589
00:51:50,485 --> 00:51:51,820
Court is adjourned.

590
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:34,738
- You see him?
- I see him.

591
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:52,047
Hey.

592
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:14,528
Thank you.

593
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:10,876
You okay?

594
00:54:13,629 --> 00:54:14,838
I can't sleep.

595
00:54:16,924 --> 00:54:19,176
When I do sleep, it's like I didn't.

596
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:22,095
It's the apnea, Larry.
They're supposed to be treating that.

597
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:26,642
What are you gonna do?

598
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:29,260
You're gonna tell 'em
to treat it, Larry.

599
00:54:29,272 --> 00:54:31,188
It was a contributory factor,
they said.

600
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:33,774
Contri...

601
00:54:36,735 --> 00:54:38,362
To your suicide try.

602
00:54:39,238 --> 00:54:41,615
What? Wasn't why I did it.

603
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:44,243
Then why?

604
00:54:50,249 --> 00:54:53,085
- I don't belong in here.
- Yes, you do.

605
00:54:53,168 --> 00:54:55,045
I don't deserve this injus...

606
00:54:56,964 --> 00:54:59,383
"Yes, you do?" What?

607
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:00,968
You do.

608
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:04,972
It's all mucked up in your head, man.
It's eating you away.

609
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:07,850
What?

610
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:11,562
- The girls, Larry.
- No.

611
00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:13,105
- The girls. Yes.
- No.

612
00:55:13,188 --> 00:55:16,316
You gotta tell people what you did.
You gotta get clear of it.

613
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:23,824
You're my brother.

614
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:29,246
And I failed you.
I didn't look after you right.

615
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:35,335
Look, if you get the flu,
I'm supposed to get you medicine.

616
00:55:35,878 --> 00:55:39,464
If you're cold, and I have a blanket,
I'm supposed to share it with you.

617
00:55:40,048 --> 00:55:41,675
If you're fucked up in how you think,

618
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:43,677
I'm supposed to help you
not do bad things.

619
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,929
No.

620
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:49,433
No, Gary. Not you.

621
00:55:52,102 --> 00:55:53,103
I...

622
00:55:57,649 --> 00:55:58,650
Look, I...

623
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:03,488
I need to do what's right here, Larry.

624
00:56:07,618 --> 00:56:08,911
And not for them.

625
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:11,914
Not for them, but for you.

626
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,543
You're never gonna
stop living in fucking…

627
00:56:17,669 --> 00:56:19,630
agony till you do.

628
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:21,840
Gary.

629
00:56:25,802 --> 00:56:27,304
Not you, Gary.

630
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:31,391
Please. Hey. Please?

631
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:34,520
Gotta let me help you.

632
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:45,739
Ladies and gentlemen,
our flying time today to Grand Rapids

633
00:56:45,822 --> 00:56:48,492
will be approximately 55 minutes.

634
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:50,661
The captain has turned off
the seat belt sign,

635
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:52,871
so relax and enjoy the flight.

636
00:57:03,048 --> 00:57:04,508
Can I get you anything, sir?

637
00:57:05,884 --> 00:57:07,261
Vodka soda, please.

638
00:57:31,076 --> 00:57:32,077
Lemon or lime?

639
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,121
Lemon.

640
00:57:36,832 --> 00:57:37,916
Most people choose lime.

641
00:57:41,587 --> 00:57:42,963
I'm a rebel.

642
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:45,257
A bad boy.

643
00:57:46,842 --> 00:57:48,302
Well, I'm trying to reform.

644
00:57:50,179 --> 00:57:51,346
No, you're not.

645
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,850
What's your name?

646
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:56,435
Tori. With an "I."

647
00:57:58,187 --> 00:58:00,898
Jimmy. With a "Y."

648
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:03,984
Nice to meet you, Jimmy.

649
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,612
Nice to meet you, Tori with an "I".
