1
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,125
We've all heard that thing

2
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,502
about the butterfly flapping its wings
in Africa,

3
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:29,006
and months later
there's a hurricane in Miami.

4
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,299
Well, if you haven't, look it up.

5
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,679
It means things you don't think
are connected actually are.

6
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,816
I never knew this girl.

7
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,403
Never met her.

8
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,993
This is the life she knew.

9
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,847
And this is the life I knew.

10
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,398
There I am. There's the kid.

11
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,442
Did you just call yourself "the kid"?

12
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:33,529
Wait, isn't this the game
you fumbled three times in one quarter?

13
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,907
This is also the game
where I did this, motherfucker.

14
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,702
You wouldn't think so,
but it is all connected.

15
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,164
These knuckleheads.
That girl on the bike.

16
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:47,584
Wait. Who's that
streaking down the sideline?

17
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,711
Kankakee's favorite son.

18
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,672
Me, with my million-dollar smile.

19
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,091
Owner of grad school records
that still stand.

20
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,427
Given not one, not two,
but three fucking scholarship offers.

21
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,929
Hey, it was four, actually.

22
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,268
Christ, Jimmy, you
really were something.

23
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,022
What about me?

24
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,858
Well, he made even you look good.

25
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,610
Pride and joy of Kankakee.

26
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,532
- See?
- Okay.

27
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,034
Try not to burn the place down,

28
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,744
and remember to lock up this time.

29
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,496
- Yeah.
- Wait, what's with the pillow?

30
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:27,791
Anybody heard from Danny?

31
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,423
Here's the real play. Watch this shit.

32
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,008
Right here. Right there.

33
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,843
You fucking has-been pretty boy.

34
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,280
You know those times where
you think something's gonna go one way,

35
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,324
but it goes sideways?

36
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,120
If I had to pick the moment,

37
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,498
here's where it all started
to go sideways for me.

38
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,837
Like, for fucking ever.

39
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:30,646
Hiya, Jimmy.

40
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,981
- Hi, Rog.
- Hop in.

41
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,816
What's with the pillow?

42
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,237
Well, last time I saw you, you said
you kept getting cricks in your neck.

43
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,321
I used to get 'em too.

44
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,822
Discovered this pillow.

45
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,407
Never got 'em again.

46
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:47,246
You are the most profoundly considerate
motherfucker I've ever met.

47
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,164
I thank you, my good man.

48
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,457
Put it in the back.

49
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,346
What's with the orange shotgun?

50
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,348
I got a shipment of bean bags.

51
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,142
You know the kind cops fire
at riots and shit?

52
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,936
They trick the guns
out with weird colors

53
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,730
so they don't load live rounds
during protests,

54
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,857
kill some poor fucker

55
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,192
who's just asking to be treated
like a human being.

56
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:23,031
So appreciative you came in person
to deal with this. That it...

57
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,826
Touches me in a deep place.

58
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,204
I'm so sorry about that last shipment.

59
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,039
Mistakes happen.

60
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,334
Not a whole kilo, man. I've...

61
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,379
It's fucking embarrassing.

62
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,214
I mean, I've never been light before.

63
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:43,635
Not so much as a gram with anyone, ever.

64
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,388
Why would I claim I got shorted?

65
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,891
Hard to know a man's heart.

66
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,189
Come on now.

67
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,831
How did you know
the shortage was on my end?

68
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:16,293
I know because my guy told me.
And I trust my guy, Danny.

69
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,171
And why do you trust Danny, man?

70
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,589
We grew up together.

71
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,134
That's adorable.

72
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,726
Jimmy. I'm sorry, Jim.

73
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,146
- Danny.
- Jimmy, I'm so sorry.

74
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,397
What did you do?

75
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,858
Tell him.

76
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,111
Tell him.

77
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,324
I stole your key, man.

78
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,910
I needed to get right
with Bern's people.

79
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,204
We knew it wasn't us.

80
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,748
I had no idea.

81
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,416
He told me that.

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,252
No, Rog, no!

83
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,588
- Okay.
- Bean bag.

84
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:04,466
Okay, he clipped the key.

85
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,636
Okay? Here's a key.

86
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,350
And a second.

87
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,811
For your trouble.

88
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,524
No!

89
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,402
Fuck, man!

90
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:25,404
Okay.

91
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,114
Not a bean bag.

92
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,700
And a third for our friendship.

93
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,289
You know, this isn't
just about the money.

94
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,083
Come on. Nothing's just about money,
but they mostly are.

95
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,170
He stole from me.

96
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:44,173
No, he stole from me.
I'd already paid you.

97
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:47,509
I came here today to be compensated
if there had been some kind of mistake,

98
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:48,719
but there wasn't.

99
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,054
Just this asshole stealing from me.

100
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,849
- But blaming me.
- No, I never blamed you.

101
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,517
- I didn't...
- Shut the fuck up!

102
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:02,983
Rog. This guy, I've known him
since first grade. He's like family.

103
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,985
Be like if you were asked
to give up your own brother.

104
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,403
No matter what, could you do it?

105
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,988
You still have half the bag.

106
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,115
My family would be worth the whole bag.

107
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,125
I think we come from
different types of family.

108
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,587
So, you're saying his life is
only worth three kilos?

109
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,465
His life is worth
three times what you lost,

110
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:27,883
because you lost nothing!

111
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,593
He's only worth three kilos?

112
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,347
Yes! Okay, his life is only worth
three kilos to me!

113
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:49,279
All I ask of the people I do
business with is their authentic self.

114
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,158
Nice to see you, Jimmy.

115
00:08:55,744 --> 00:09:00,791
You can use the cart to transport
that young rascal to the car.

116
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,026
Have you had a look at the menu, sir?

117
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,574
Jesus. No. I'm sorry…

118
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:18,994
Rochelle.

119
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,416
Could I get a water, please?

120
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,877
And I'll have an answer for you
by the time you're back?

121
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,961
Of course, sir.

122
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,464
Jimmy.

123
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,592
Of course, Jimmy.

124
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,105
Yeah.

125
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,251
Hands, motherfucker! Hands!

126
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,049
You smiling now, bitch?

127
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,020
Can I get up now, please?

128
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,897
You just lie there and take it.

129
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,441
We're clear.

130
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:13,525
Turn it off.

131
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,452
Damn, Jimbo.
What you get up to last night?

132
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,083
You even know her name?

133
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,251
Rochelle.

134
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,546
Her last name?

135
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,393
Planning to shoot up
a local middle school?

136
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:49,728
That's federal.

137
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,402
Fuck is this, Jimbo?

138
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,656
Jimmy. It's an AK-47.

139
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,200
It's a "no possibility
of reduced sentence."

140
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:04,993
I got great lawyers.

141
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,666
They turn water into wine?

142
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,719
Hey! You got a visitor.

143
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,228
Window one!

144
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,896
They tried that last time…

145
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,233
Keene. Next up, window two.

146
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,125
Window three, you're up.

147
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,293
You okay?

148
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,838
Did your mother come visit you yet?

149
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:01,216
She's still pissed I got Tim mixed up
in that thing a while back.

150
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,137
Well… at least your
brother's gonna walk.

151
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,682
I'm not?

152
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,226
I talked to some of the guys.

153
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:16,273
They said the prosecutor, Beaumont,
he's trying to prove something with you.

154
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:18,567
Prove what?

155
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,777
That he's not part of the machine.

156
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,738
I'm not part of the machine.

157
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,073
I was.

158
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,618
My family.

159
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,204
Your mother's family.

160
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,457
Tell me there's a way out of this.

161
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,708
Not a quick one.

162
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:36,919
Window four, that's it.

163
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,754
You'll get five years.

164
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:40,380
Five...

165
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,799
Four with good behavior.

166
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,928
The low end
of the sentencing guidelines is

167
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:49,348
if you take the plea, you get two years.

168
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,518
They're not gonna give you two years.

169
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,229
Why not?

170
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,355
The guns.

171
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,883
You're not some homey
who's running around

172
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:02,528
capping grandmothers,
doing a drive-by.

173
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,112
You didn't sell crack, right?

174
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:07,074
You're a good kid
who strayed off the path.

175
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,536
You'll have to do the midrange.

176
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,205
How do you know?

177
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,376
I was a cop for 23 years.

178
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:21,964
And I asked around,
and they all said the same thing.

179
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,383
Midrange of the guidelines.

180
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,260
Five.

181
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,427
Out in four.

182
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:29,721
I…

183
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,433
I never wanted this for you.

184
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,522
I wanted a totally different deal.

185
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,484
Like what?

186
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,444
Like I said.

187
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:45,529
No.

188
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,072
What?

189
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:51,285
For you to have,

190
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,369
you know…

191
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,579
No, I don't.

192
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,875
A wife. Kids.

193
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:01,628
A fucking dog to play Frisbee with.

194
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:04,006
And a steady paycheck.

195
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,175
Pension at the end.

196
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,760
I do...

197
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,305
I couldn't have…

198
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:13,724
What?

199
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,103
…helped you if I lived that life.

200
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,902
I still wanted it for you.

201
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,410
I know.

202
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:36,455
I know you did, Dad.

203
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,336
You just never mentioned it before.

204
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,215
Four! Window four, all done.

205
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:52,221
Take the deal. Okay? Plea out.

206
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,025
Okay. In the case of the United States
versus James Keene…

207
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,487
Mr. Beaumont, am I to understand

208
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,698
that the defendant has entered into
a plea agreement with your office?

209
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,076
He has, Your Honor.

210
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,078
And Mr. Steinbeck,

211
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,080
is your client fully aware
of what he's pleading to today?

212
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,208
He is, Your Honor.

213
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,711
Mr. Keene.

214
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,641
Police officer's son, correct?

215
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:40,227
Yes, sir.

216
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,272
Star athlete at Kankakee High.

217
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:46,441
I see you're quite generous
with a few local charities.

218
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,243
But what you're
pleading guilty to today

219
00:17:49,255 --> 00:17:51,113
is the sale and
trafficking of narcotics,

220
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,657
the possession of paraphernalia
associated with the same,

221
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:57,369
and possession
of multiple illegal firearms.

222
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,456
So, how plead you?

223
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:03,876
Guilty.

224
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,713
The sheer amount of narcotics
that you trafficked in, Mr. Keene,

225
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:11,175
is enough to push your sentence
to 25 years.

226
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,553
Which you most certainly
would have gotten at minimum

227
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,305
if your case had gone to trial.

228
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:19,391
But you did the smart thing today.
You pled.

229
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,686
Still, there are the weapons,
which one presumes

230
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,189
you were prepared to use
against other human beings

231
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,940
to protect your narcotics.

232
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,194
Therefore,

233
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:33,030
it is the judgment of the court
the defendant be committed

234
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:36,491
to the custody of the attorney general
of the United States,

235
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,493
or her authorized representative,

236
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:42,664
for the minimum guideline term
of 120 months.

237
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,586
Bailiff.

238
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,839
Ten years?

239
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:53,926
Ten fucking years? Are you kidding me?

240
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,929
You lied to me, Beaumont!
You fucking lied to me!

241
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,577
You know what this is about?

242
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,647
On or off?

243
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,315
Off.

244
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:04,580
I'm Special Agent Lauren McCauley.

245
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:06,456
You can call me that or Lauren.

246
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,834
I remember you don't like "Jimbo."

247
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:10,669
Jimmy, please.

248
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,505
And you know Mr. Beaumont.

249
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:20,512
Mr. Beaumont sandbagged me
into accepting a five-year plea

250
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,514
when he knew I'd get ten.

251
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:23,807
So you remember it?

252
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,268
No possibility of parole.

253
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,353
Who takes that deal?

254
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:30,355
You.

255
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,566
You're a drug dealer.

256
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,986
And you played chicken with us,
and you lost.

257
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:39,156
Embrace that concept.

258
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:40,908
Now, sit down.

259
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,627
I hear you're making
a real go of prison.

260
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,337
No major beefs.

261
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,631
Seem to get along
with most of the dominant gangs

262
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,008
and successfully avoid
the ones you don't know yet.

263
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:02,054
And… you've developed
a sideline in here?

264
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:03,305
No shit.

265
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,307
That's in there?

266
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,100
You use your profits to buy

267
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,396
fresh vegetables and lean cuts of meat?

268
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,523
Prison food sucks.

269
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,149
So does prison life,

270
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,443
but you seem to have
grabbed it by the balls.

271
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:19,780
What is this sideline, by the way?

272
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,617
Just a service.

273
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,285
He's so modest.

274
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,912
You rent porno mags, right?

275
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:31,291
Hustler. Penthouse. Barely Legal.

276
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,086
How's that work?

277
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,464
They pay for half-hour blocks.

278
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:41,260
Must be a lot of... What do
they call it in retail? Breakage?

279
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:44,221
I turn my inventory over a lot.

280
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:47,391
That's what you called drugs too.
Your "inventory."

281
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,309
At least on the tapes I heard.

282
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:55,941
I'm not surprised you're
thriving in here, Jimmy.

283
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,067
I'm not thriving.

284
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,820
Because you're a charming guy.
Everyone likes you.

285
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:02,239
I've heard you talk
to Mexican cartel guys,

286
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:03,782
Cabrini-Green bangers,

287
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:06,910
Outfit goombahs in their tracksuits
at the Elmwood Park Social Club.

288
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:08,704
You get along with everyone.

289
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:11,623
I've noticed something else.

290
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:12,791
After a certain point,

291
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,794
they do most of the talking.

292
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:18,463
I'm sorry?

293
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,257
You've got your patter,
your funny story or two,

294
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,468
but then you settle back
and just let them run their mouths.

295
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:25,053
Take me.

296
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:27,848
Something in those
soulful eyes of yours.

297
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:32,019
The way you sit so still,
so at peace with yourself.

298
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:36,190
It makes me want to babble, man.
Unlock myself.

299
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:38,442
You mentioned a point a while back?

300
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:41,320
You in a rush?
'Cause we can let you get back to it.

301
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:44,656
No. I'm fine.

302
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,117
You got porn to sell,
veggies to procure,

303
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,243
and only

304
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,705
nine years,
three months left on your sentence?

305
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,082
- Just tell me what you want.
- I don't wanna hold you up.

306
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,792
Just fucking tell me why I'm here.

307
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,129
Temper.

308
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:02,382
Not as cool as he thinks.

309
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,059
We would like you
to transfer to another prison

310
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,853
and befriend someone
to elicit a confession.

311
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:19,650
We need the precise location
of a dead body.

312
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,530
You need it?

313
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:27,741
We suspect that the man
that you'll read about in that file

314
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,160
has killed 14 women, maybe more.

315
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:34,373
But we only tied him to two.
And we only have one of the bodies.

316
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:37,876
We'd like to find the other one.
And maybe 12 more.

317
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,091
And this prison where the guy is?

318
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,262
It's in Springfield, Missouri.

319
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,349
Maximum security,
specializing in the criminally insane.

320
00:23:56,645 --> 00:24:01,942
So… you want me to check in to hell,

321
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:05,153
cozy up to a fucking demon,

322
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:10,742
and ask him all casual,
"Hey, so where'd you bury 13 bodies?"

323
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,579
Is that right?

324
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:24,381
Not for all the fucking money
in the world.

325
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:29,178
How about freedom?

326
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:35,058
A complete commutation of your sentence.

327
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:42,149
If I transfer?

328
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:44,693
If you transfer.

329
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:49,573
And if you get the location
of Patricia Reitler's body.

330
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:51,491
No body, no release.

331
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:54,411
No body, no release.

332
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:04,796
No.

333
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:07,674
No?

334
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:08,884
No.

335
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:14,515
His conviction's on appeal.
He could win and walk.

336
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:20,437
If he walks, he'll kill again and again
until he fucks up and gets caught.

337
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:23,732
The last time,
he killed 14 girls before he got caught.

338
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,984
And it won't have
anything to do with me.

339
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:27,319
It will.

340
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:30,239
You had the chance to stop him,
and you didn't take it.

341
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:36,537
Look, I'm sorry about these women,
but I don't know them.

342
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:39,331
And if he gets out,
I won't know the next ones he kills.

343
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:41,041
I might be sad about it, but…

344
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:43,252
This kind of deal
won't walk through the door twice.

345
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:49,591
So, before you spend the next ten years
wondering why you didn't take it…

346
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:54,555
look at the file.

347
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:05,023
At the very least,
it'll make unique reading material.

348
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:12,155
Your attorney has our contact info.

349
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:54,114
Come on, Brooke!

350
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:58,452
Come on, Brookie!

351
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,787
- She hung onto it.
- Holy shit. She did!

352
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:01,955
Okay.

353
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,419
Honey, you're going
the wrong direction!

354
00:27:03,431 --> 00:27:04,208
Honey, the other way!

355
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,251
- Wrong direction!
- The other way!

356
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:13,300
Well, she runs pretty fast.

357
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:16,220
Yeah. Not bad, right?

358
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:20,307
Will he be home for dinner?

359
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,558
Not likely.

360
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:23,852
We found Jessica Roach.

361
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,574
Line it up. Here we go. First down.

362
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,647
Over there. Yeah.

363
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:41,842
He stepped out right about here.

364
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:43,343
What did he look like?

365
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:46,221
He was white. That's about all I saw.

366
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:50,142
Was he short? Tall? Bald? Not bald?

367
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:53,979
I didn't get a good look at him.
He hopped in a van and drove off.

368
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:55,856
What color van?

369
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,068
It was like a gray or brown...

370
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:02,863
It was night.
It could have been green too, or black.

371
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:05,199
I know it was a Dodge, for sure.

372
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:09,161
You don't know the color of the van,
but you know…

373
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:11,622
I'm a mechanic.
I know a Dodge when I see one.

374
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:25,886
Vermilion County
Sheriff's Department. Can I help you?

375
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:28,805
He sure is.

376
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:44,321
Hey, Len.
You filed a report a couple of weeks ago

377
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:47,241
on a possible 647 over at Whittier?

378
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:50,494
Yep. Two 14-year-old
girls riding their bikes.

379
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,955
Said this perv in a
van kept passing them.

380
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:54,706
Told them he liked their boobies.

381
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,626
- He said "boobies"?
- Yep.

382
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:00,045
He also asked
if they wanted to take a ride with him.

383
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:01,129
Uh-huh.

384
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,298
Yeah, well, they said the van…

385
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,343
the van's gray?

386
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:08,470
Yep, they got a plate.

387
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:10,639
- They got what?
- Indiana plate number.

388
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,392
Check the notes at
the end of the report.

389
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:16,687
Okay. Did you run it?

390
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,190
No. The guy drove off.
They never saw him again.

391
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:22,651
And the girl struck me as
a little dramatic.

392
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,069
You know girls, man.

393
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,696
But be my guest, Brian.

394
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,698
Okay. Thanks, Len.

395
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:36,290
That van that followed
the two girls in Whittier,

396
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,501
it's been called in three other times
in the last year.

397
00:32:41,003 --> 00:32:45,757
Once in Indianola, once in Olivet,
once near the Dauphin Reserve.

398
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:48,677
The same complaint
every time. Harassment.

399
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:52,472
And said van is registered to...

400
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:56,393
Larry D. Hall. Wabash, Indiana.

401
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:00,939
Your sister told me
your mother actually visited.

402
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:04,276
She did. She's pissed you brought
your girlfriend to my sentencing.

403
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:07,154
I've been with Sammy
longer than I was with your mother.

404
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,323
She's pissed Sammy makes me happy.

405
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,700
I just wish you liked her more.

406
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:14,494
Sam? I like her fine.
She just ain't my mother.

407
00:33:15,454 --> 00:33:16,622
Uh-huh.

408
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:24,588
I've been thinking about that deal.

409
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:27,257
What? You think this place is bad?

410
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:31,345
Springfield is the kind of prison
that they send subhumans to.

411
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:33,805
The fucking freaks with no souls.

412
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:35,766
Lifers with nothing to lose.

413
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:38,143
They'll commute my whole sentence.

414
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:40,854
What happens if you don't get them
what they want?

415
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:42,981
Then what?

416
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:44,608
What happens
if you have to defend yourself,

417
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:47,361
and they tack on another ten
fucking years to your sentence?

418
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:49,863
That'd be a death sentence.

419
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:52,157
We'll find a way.
We'll figure something out.

420
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:53,951
- How?
- I don't know.

421
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:56,745
But we're going to find a way.

422
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,114
You've got a call from Wabash PD.

423
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:35,449
Yeah? Put it through, please.

424
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:40,289
Detective Miller? Chris Drysdale.

425
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:41,873
Hey, Chris.

426
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:44,668
Got a question about a van

427
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:50,924
registered to a resident of yours,
a Lawrence D. Hall?

428
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:52,467
Sure. Larry.

429
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:53,552
You know him?

430
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:55,469
I grew up with him.

431
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:57,556
You know him well?

432
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:59,933
Well enough. It's a small town.

433
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,352
You looking at him for something?

434
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:08,692
Well, we're just trying to figure out
why a van registered to him

435
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:13,488
passed through our area
a couple of times in the last year.

436
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:16,074
You're in Illinois, the girl said.

437
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:18,744
Georgetown, about
130 miles down the road.

438
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:21,622
So, he wasn't picking
up a gallon of milk.

439
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:22,831
Nope.

440
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:24,791
Or doing Civil War shit?

441
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,376
What's that?

442
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:32,216
Larry's into Civil War reenactments.
You know, they dress up in the uniforms.

443
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,219
Larry has these funky muttonchop
sideburns, and they play at the battles.

444
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:37,054
They do it all over the place.

445
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,932
You should check if they had any
at the times he was around your town.

446
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:41,475
I bet that will explain it.

447
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:43,393
Okay.

448
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,230
Thank you, Chris. I'll look into it.

449
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:47,648
Yeah, sure enough. Take care.

450
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,978
Vermilion County Parks Department.

451
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:53,106
Hey, this is Brian Miller
over at the Sheriff's Department,

452
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,983
trying to ascertain whether or not

453
00:37:55,651 --> 00:38:01,448
any Civil War reenactors
have filed for permits in the last year?

454
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:04,952
That could take a bit. Can you wait?

455
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:06,703
Yes, ma'am, I can. Thank you.

456
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:07,829
Okay, hold on.

457
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:16,547
Okay. Are you still there?

458
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,631
Yes, ma'am.

459
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:20,884
Sorry, we have no record
of a Civil War reenactment

460
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:23,011
over the last three years.

461
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:24,346
Okay.

462
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:27,140
Well, thank you for your time.
Appreciate it.

463
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:29,518
However, there was a Revolutionary War.

464
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:31,770
What is that?

465
00:38:31,854 --> 00:38:35,607
I said there was
a Revolutionary War reenactment though.

466
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:36,692
When?

467
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:38,944
Last summer, Forest Glen Park.

468
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:41,488
The exact date was,

469
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:44,116
let me see, July 19th.

470
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:47,870
Hello?

471
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:50,038
Hello, are you still there?

472
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,458
Detective?

473
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:56,086
Okay. Thank you.

474
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:07,764
Sammy?

475
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:13,729
Great.

476
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:24,823
Where's Dad?

477
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:32,581
He came in from the yard last week
talking funny, you know,

478
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:34,499
like he was drunk, but he wasn't.

479
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,794
He said that he had a headache.

480
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:39,254
You know, he...

481
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:41,757
He went to sit down,
but he missed the chair.

482
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,301
And the side of his
face went all droopy...

483
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,719
- He had a stroke?
- Yeah.

484
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:47,846
- Is he alive?
- Yeah. He's alive.

485
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,349
He was in the hospital for a few days,
but now he's out.

486
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:51,558
Is he okay?

487
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:55,771
Is he okay?

488
00:39:55,854 --> 00:39:57,147
Told me to say he was…

489
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:00,567
but he's not.

490
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:05,948
He can't talk all the way right,
and he walks kinda to the side.

491
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:08,700
He's really weak, and he tires.

492
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:12,371
He's not good at all, no.

493
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:15,290
When did it happen?

494
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:19,545
Last week. Wednesday.

495
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:21,630
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- I am telling you.

496
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:24,132
Before. Someone should have called me.
I'm his son.

497
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:27,302
Well, he is like a baby right now.

498
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:29,582
I had to have my
sister drive two hours

499
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,431
to watch him so I
could come and tell you.

500
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:33,100
What do you want? A fucking parade?

501
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:40,566
You know, the doctor said
it was stress that did it.

502
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:45,821
Know what caused that stress?
You. In here.

503
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:49,575
It is all he ever fucking talks about.

504
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:53,120
His poor Jimmy doing time
because he was a bad father.

505
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:56,331
He was a bad father. Didn't do his job.

506
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:58,458
Well, listen to me. He did his job.

507
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:00,878
Nobody made you sell that shit.

508
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:02,963
Nobody put a gun to your head.

509
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:06,049
And now you're in here,
and it is killing him.

510
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:17,394
You through?

511
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:23,817
He told me you got some way of getting
out of here earlier than the ten years.

512
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:28,238
He don't got ten years.

513
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:33,827
And if you stay in here,
he don't got three.

514
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:19,790
Detective Drysdale, this is Brian Miller
from Georgetown again.

515
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:20,999
Hey, Brian.

516
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:26,004
Yeah, well, that Civil War tip you gave
us really paid off. Thank you for that.

517
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:28,632
You said you grew up with Larry.

518
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:30,884
Well, what's he like?

519
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:32,678
A harmless weirdo.

520
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:38,016
Sorry, I got "harmless."

521
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,061
I said, he's a harmless weirdo.

522
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:43,522
Uh-huh. Why weirdo?

523
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:46,942
Well, the sideburns, like I said.

524
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:50,904
He grew up
with a mom and dad who were odd.

525
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:53,740
And the cemetery, you know.

526
00:42:54,491 --> 00:42:55,659
The cemetery?

527
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:58,912
A what?

528
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:02,040
A gravedigger.
Larry grew up on a graveyard.

529
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:03,834
But he's harmless.

530
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,127
Why would you say that?

531
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:07,713
He just is. He's a twerpy kinda guy.

532
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:09,464
He got beat up a bunch in school.

533
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:10,549
Uh-huh.

534
00:43:11,175 --> 00:43:13,677
The thing is,
there's a girl that went missing...

535
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,803
The college girl?

536
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:18,056
He confessed to
that, but he didn't do it.

537
00:43:19,183 --> 00:43:20,517
Marion PD cleared him.

538
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:23,395
Said he was a serial confessor.

539
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:25,522
But no, I...

540
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:30,903
He confessed in a missing persons case?

541
00:43:30,986 --> 00:43:32,946
In Marion, yeah.

542
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,449
They ascertained he was full of shit.
That...

543
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:38,952
But that's Larry. He's always trying
to make himself look bigger than he is.

544
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:42,289
Let me call you from my landline.

545
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:04,663
Hey.

546
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:05,747
I'm back.

547
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:09,751
Yeah. So, Chris, the thing is,

548
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:14,965
we got a girl, went missing,
turned up dead.

549
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:18,760
And you think Larry Hall
could have something to do with it?

550
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:20,387
Well, we don't know.

551
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:25,851
What we do know is a van was seen
driving around the area

552
00:45:25,934 --> 00:45:30,898
and, you know, he was creeping out girls
in the area on more than one occasion.

553
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:33,942
So, with your help,
we'd like to talk to him.

554
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:39,698
Well, I mean…

555
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:43,911
I have to disagree with you here.

556
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,332
On which part?

557
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,877
Where Larry Hall could have
anything to do with a dead girl.

558
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:55,506
He just likes to talk.

559
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:57,674
Like in Marion.

560
00:45:57,758 --> 00:46:01,512
They got the guy who did it,
and it sure wasn't Larry.

561
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:06,308
Fair enough.

562
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:13,815
I'll call him in here,
and I'll get us a room.

563
00:46:13,899 --> 00:46:15,108
I'll set it up.

564
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,321
10:00 tomorrow work for you?

565
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:22,699
Yes. Sure. Yes.

566
00:46:22,783 --> 00:46:24,743
You think you can get him there
without a hitch?

567
00:46:24,826 --> 00:46:26,411
If I can't, I'll call you.

568
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:27,955
Else, I'll see you at 10:00.

569
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:37,589
Okay.

570
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:46,306
- I said, okay.
- I heard the word.

571
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:48,976
Why don't you elaborate?

572
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,355
I'll accept the transfer

573
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:58,235
and befriend this sick fucking puppy
and get you what you want.

574
00:46:59,236 --> 00:47:00,612
So, let's get to it.

575
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:05,576
I'm glad you've made yourself available.

576
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:09,454
But I never said the job was yours.

577
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:12,791
I asked if you were interested.

578
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:14,835
- Now I know you are.
- Wait a second.

579
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:17,671
We're looking at more than one applicant
for the position.

580
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,175
Fuck are you talking about?

581
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:22,593
I just told you.

582
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:28,140
I'll let my bosses know
you're amenable to a transfer

583
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,311
and put your name
in the hat for the job.

584
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:33,604
And we'll go from there.

585
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,195
Keep doing your homework.

586
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:44,531
You're not going to want to blow
the job interview, believe me.

587
00:48:27,616 --> 00:48:31,411
Hi. Detective Miller.
I have a 10:00 a.m. with Drysdale.

588
00:48:31,495 --> 00:48:33,872
- Brian?
- Chris!

589
00:48:33,956 --> 00:48:35,541
Hey, it's good to meet you.

590
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:36,667
Likewise.

591
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,544
- He in a box?
- Larry?

592
00:48:38,627 --> 00:48:40,045
No, he's across the street.

593
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:42,464
We got him in a conference room
with the Marion guys.

594
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:44,383
The detectives?

595
00:48:44,466 --> 00:48:46,552
Yeah. They want to question him
on the Reitler case.

596
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:49,179
We wanted to observe.

597
00:48:49,263 --> 00:48:51,557
But I was hoping that
he would be at ease.

598
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:53,725
Not think anything was up.

599
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:57,062
Well, he spent a whole day with
the Marion guys once, driving around.

600
00:48:57,145 --> 00:48:58,522
He's pretty relaxed with them.

601
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:01,066
Why were they driving around?

602
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:03,986
He claimed he could take them to a body.
Patricia Reitler's.

603
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:06,071
- But he didn't, because, like I said...
- Yeah, no.

604
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:07,573
He's "full of shit." I know.

605
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:16,540
Detective Russ Aborn, Brian Miller,
with the Vermilion Sheriffs.

606
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:17,624
Hey.

607
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,960
Derek's in with him now,
shooting the shit.

608
00:49:20,669 --> 00:49:23,589
I know you like him
for some dead girl in your town,

609
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:26,758
but we wasted a day with this guy
on the Reitler case.

610
00:49:26,842 --> 00:49:30,345
And he dragged us all around,
one cornfield to the next,

611
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:32,598
and he didn't do it.

612
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:35,100
So, I doubt he did yours.

613
00:49:35,184 --> 00:49:38,228
He just likes confessing to cops.

614
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:41,857
Good to know.

615
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:53,327
Derek Johansen.

616
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:58,498
Now, those are some exquisite burnsides.

617
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:02,878
Named after General Ambrose Burnside,

618
00:50:03,462 --> 00:50:05,797
a civil war general
from around these parts, right?

619
00:50:05,881 --> 00:50:11,136
A lot of people call them sideburns,
but the proper term is burnsides, yeah.

620
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,056
Well, yours are impressive,
no matter what they're called.

621
00:50:14,556 --> 00:50:16,225
You leave them in place year-round?

622
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:21,188
Yeah, it's easier than having to regrow
them before every reenactment.

623
00:50:22,064 --> 00:50:25,609
You do both the Civil War and
Revolutionary War reenactments, right?

624
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:29,571
Sorry, I'm Brian.

625
00:50:29,655 --> 00:50:33,116
I'm with the Vermilion County Sheriffs
in Georgetown.

626
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,243
Indiana?

627
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:35,369
Illinois.

628
00:50:38,205 --> 00:50:39,373
Never heard of it.

629
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:45,587
We had a Revolutionary War reenactment.

630
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:49,883
I guess it was one town over.
The same county.

631
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:55,681
You didn't attend a Revolutionary War
reenactment in Illinois last summer?

632
00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:01,979
I don't know, maybe.

633
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:06,942
Well, yeah, he did a lot of this when
he was leading us to Tricia Reitler.

634
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:08,944
"I don't know, maybe."

635
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,863
Didn't you, Larry?

636
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:15,117
C'mon, tell him, Larry.

637
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,494
Tell him how you, I don't know, maybe.

638
00:51:17,578 --> 00:51:19,371
And, I can't quite remember...

639
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:21,415
If you want to question Mr. Hall
in your case,

640
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:23,083
why don't you go ahead
and arrange a time.

641
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:25,127
Right now,
I'd like to chat with him about mine.

642
00:51:28,463 --> 00:51:30,507
By all means, chat.

643
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:38,557
All right, Larry,
this is Georgetown right here, okay?

644
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,353
And this is Forest Glen Park.

645
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,360
And…

646
00:51:51,153 --> 00:51:53,030
McHenry Township, right up here.

647
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:56,283
And this would have been
where the reenactment take place.

648
00:51:56,366 --> 00:51:58,035
McHenry. Yeah, I've been there.

649
00:51:58,869 --> 00:51:59,870
Last summer?

650
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:04,416
I mean,
I think so, yeah. Like around there.

651
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:07,169
I know that there's a Hardee's...

652
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:09,296
Sorry.

653
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,381
No, it's okay.

654
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:17,137
I remember there was a Hardee's
right around here.

655
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:19,640
That's right. They do, Larry.
It's right here.

656
00:52:19,723 --> 00:52:24,353
Yep.
I had a sandwich and some french fries

657
00:52:24,436 --> 00:52:29,399
when I was driving around
trying to find a guy who had a Charger.

658
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:31,735
A Dodge?

659
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:39,117
Yeah. I have a '82 Dodge van, and
some of the parts are interchangeable.

660
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:41,995
Did you ever find the guy?

661
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:47,084
No, I don't think that I did.

662
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:51,088
- But you drove around looking?
- Yep.

663
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:55,759
Larry loves Dodges. Heard all about them
that day we drove him around.

664
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:58,136
Yeah, well, I like Mopar parts.

665
00:52:58,804 --> 00:53:03,809
I'll find these little junkers
that are rusted underneath a tree

666
00:53:03,892 --> 00:53:06,812
or behind some of these people's houses.

667
00:53:07,646 --> 00:53:08,981
They're not doing nothing with them.

668
00:53:09,064 --> 00:53:12,401
So… maybe I know a body shop

669
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:17,573
that… needs a tailpipe

670
00:53:17,656 --> 00:53:20,659
or… filter housing,

671
00:53:20,742 --> 00:53:24,663
and then I'll just buy it for 20
and resell it for 35.

672
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:27,583
Must be a lot of driving around.

673
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:29,001
Oh, yeah. A lot of miles.

674
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:30,294
But I like to drive.

675
00:53:32,171 --> 00:53:35,966
And when you were driving around,
do you remember talking to two girls?

676
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:45,934
I asked for directions.
They were very rude.

677
00:53:46,018 --> 00:53:47,269
How were they rude?

678
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:54,526
They told me to...

679
00:53:57,362 --> 00:53:58,572
Sorry, what?

680
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:01,783
Told me to go fuck myself.

681
00:54:02,367 --> 00:54:04,161
Did you exchange words with them?

682
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:06,121
I did. It was all in fun.

683
00:54:06,747 --> 00:54:09,666
Like the misunderstanding
with the jogger, Larry?

684
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,001
Yeah.

685
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:12,669
- Yeah.
- Misunderstanding?

686
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:15,339
Larry had some words with
a jogger in town a few times.

687
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:17,049
She accused him of stalking her.

688
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:19,176
I didn't stalk anyone.

689
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:21,261
Yeah, I can't help it if I drive home

690
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:25,682
past where some girl runs
the same time every day. I mean...

691
00:54:25,766 --> 00:54:28,352
Come on, Larry.
Was a little more to it than that.

692
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:29,686
And she smiled at me.

693
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:31,730
- She smiled at you?
- Yeah.

694
00:54:32,606 --> 00:54:34,358
Abby, the...

695
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:35,692
The jogger.

696
00:54:36,193 --> 00:54:37,361
And you know her name?

697
00:54:38,195 --> 00:54:39,905
Yeah, it's a small town.

698
00:54:44,785 --> 00:54:47,246
Larry, these two girls in my town...

699
00:54:47,329 --> 00:54:49,206
You know,
I was just goofing around with them.

700
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:51,124
If they said that there was more to it,

701
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:53,335
then they just didn't get the joke,
I'm sorry.

702
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:56,171
I would never dream
of hurting two girls.

703
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,923
Well, you might dream of it.

704
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,137
All right.
