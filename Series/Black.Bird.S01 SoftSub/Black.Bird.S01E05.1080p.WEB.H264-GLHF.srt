1
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,885
<i>When I was six, my grandmother died.</i>

2
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,723
<i>My father drove us to his hometown</i>

3
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,184
<i>of Wiggins, South Carolina
for her funeral.</i>

4
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,899
<i>I had never met her,
so her death didn't mean much to me…</i>

5
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,612
<i>though it made my father very sad.</i>

6
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,659
<i>I was afraid of her in that coffin.</i>

7
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:01,747
<i>She was part of something
that, even at six, I wondered about.</i>

8
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,374
<i>The place after this one.</i>

9
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,620
<i>I worried she was looking down</i>

10
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:14,909
<i>and didn't like us
because we were young.</i>

11
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,442
Where's Dr. Zicherman?

12
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,697
Excuse me.

13
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,325
Where's Dr. Zicherman?

14
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,827
He's on vacation.

15
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,914
He didn't tell you?

16
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,167
No.

17
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,753
That seems so unlike him.

18
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,714
Do you see him every Tuesday?

19
00:04:58,549 --> 00:04:59,591
No, just...

20
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,427
Just, you know.

21
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,806
No, I don't know.

22
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,810
Just if I need to.

23
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,940
Well, that's an uncommon arrangement.

24
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,903
How'd you know I'd be here?

25
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,740
Routine schedule is foundational
in the doctor-patient relationship.

26
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,034
But how did you know I'd be here?

27
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,204
I don't understand the question.

28
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,332
But Dr. Zicherman and I
don't have a routine.

29
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,960
How did you know
I had an appointment today?

30
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,421
We have a daily schedule.

31
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,298
Your name was on it.

32
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:46,722
Why are you here?

33
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,184
Because I had an appointment.

34
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:51,810
No.

35
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:53,854
Why are you here?

36
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,650
The charges involved

37
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:01,778
selling unregistered weapons
and crossing state lines to do so.

38
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,657
Why are you here?

39
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,410
I just told you.

40
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,371
Why are you?

41
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,875
To treat mental illness.

42
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,253
Came to the right place.

43
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,051
I'm not in law enforcement.
I'm not a judge.

44
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,887
I don't concern myself
with the crimes of the men I treat.

45
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,307
My sole concern is
protecting their mental health.

46
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,728
Sounds like you found
your purpose in life.

47
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,696
Do you prefer James or Jimmy?

48
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:49,952
Jimmy.

49
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:52,996
Jimmy.

50
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,627
Some people's psyches are
so much more fragile

51
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,983
than most people

52
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:01,981
you've probably encountered
in your life.

53
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,715
Or your own, for example.

54
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,637
How do you know anything
about my psyche?

55
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,451
I don't know much.

56
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:16,131
But I suspect
you're of fairly sound mind.

57
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,273
Good to know.

58
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,983
But some of my patients are not.

59
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:25,237
They're one wrong thought,

60
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:30,993
one termite of an unhealthy idea
from losing their minds.

61
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,370
If they break,

62
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,165
sometimes the person they were
never comes back from the break.

63
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:40,460
They become ghosts in their own bodies.

64
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,089
Why are you telling me this?

65
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,138
I'm asking you for compassion

66
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,390
when you deal with
some of the men in here.

67
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,394
Some of the men?

68
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,773
Jimmy…

69
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,650
Doctor.

70
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,446
- I'm asking...
- Asking what?

71
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,952
Are you a threat to the mental health
of any of my patients?

72
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,289
Which patients?

73
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,251
I'm giving you
an opportunity for candor here.

74
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,089
I urge you to take it seriously.

75
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,182
Which… patients?

76
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:03,418
<i>After they buried my grandmother,
my father drove us to the ocean.</i>

77
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,465
<i>It was the only time
I would ever see the ocean.</i>

78
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,971
When they were looking
for Tricia Reitler,

79
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:03,055
Larry drove Marion PD

80
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,648
up and down these roads
over and over and over again.

81
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,860
"I think I buried her here.

82
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,236
No, it was here.

83
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,779
Maybe it was there.

84
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,282
No, I think I buried her under a tree."

85
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,408
Exactly.

86
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,220
That night before I take him back
to Illinois, they go back out there.

87
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,746
Same area, same result.

88
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,373
I think she's there. Somewhere.

89
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,628
That's why he dragged them back out
a second time.

90
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,755
Son of a bitch couldn't
get enough of it.

91
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:35,260
Let me see
if I can get my hands on these reports.

92
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:24,852
All right.

93
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,981
They took a left up
here before the lake.

94
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,197
There's nothing but fields out here.

95
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:43,412
That's a nice gas station
for the middle of nowhere.

96
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,038
Yeah.

97
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:50,752
All right, there should be a haul road
right up here. Take a right there.

98
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,018
- Well, good morning, James.
- Morning, Larry.

99
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,479
I didn't see you yesterday.

100
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,565
Nothing happened
that didn't happen the day before.

101
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,984
And the day before that, right?

102
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,404
How was your day?

103
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:00,989
It was good. Thanks for asking.

104
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:02,699
Gary visited.

105
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,202
- That's cool.
- It was.

106
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,455
Always nice to see family.
Is he into cars too?

107
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,416
A little. Well, not like me.

108
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,918
But the Civil War stuff?

109
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,672
He didn't stick with it.

110
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:19,716
That's a shame.

111
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,678
He married a stinky bitch.

112
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:25,722
Well…

113
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,475
She thinks it's "playing dress-up."

114
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,770
She said that?

115
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:32,938
Oh, yeah.

116
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,232
So I said to her... I said,

117
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:39,403
"You would be a grandmother
in Civil War times. An old hag."

118
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,946
Nobody would fight for her.

119
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:43,782
Brides were young.

120
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,367
Unspoiled.

121
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,913
People married younger then.

122
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,415
Much younger. Yeah.

123
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,670
My great-grandmother
had my grandmother when she was just 14.

124
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,464
That was perfectly normal back then.

125
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,926
Until the government saw
a way to make money.

126
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,471
By raising the age of consent?

127
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,056
Exactly.

128
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,185
Nobody attended
a high school back then.

129
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,769
There was no such thing.

130
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,688
But, once the government saw

131
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,149
that there was money to be made
in high schools,

132
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,067
well, then greed trumps all.

133
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:21,570
It's not about education.

134
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,697
- No?
- No, it's about...

135
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,949
It's about forcing kids
to delay growing up.

136
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,453
So that their parents can spend
every extra dime on tuition,

137
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,746
and everyone makes money.

138
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:34,208
And that's what's going to
bankrupt the country someday.

139
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,173
You know,
I never thought about it that way,

140
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,425
but damn.

141
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,344
You could be onto something.

142
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,179
You think?

143
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:50,182
You got a fresh perspective.

144
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,935
You must have heard that before.

145
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:55,312
Thank you.

146
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,484
So these brides were how young?

147
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,198
Twelve, 13 for sure.

148
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,536
Old enough to pee,
old enough for me. Right?

149
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,121
That's funny.

150
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,123
Hey…

151
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:18,377
So what's the...

152
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,713
What's the youngest you ever had?

153
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,091
What?

154
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,180
The youngest you ever had.

155
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,519
You first.

156
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,354
Why? I asked first.

157
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,149
You first.

158
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,487
Fourteen.

159
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:48,824
Did she fight back?

160
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,285
No. You had some fighters?

161
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,370
How old were you?

162
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,164
With the 14-year-old?

163
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:00,878
She was a freshman.

164
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,172
I was a senior, so I was 17.

165
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:04,715
- What?
- Seventeen.

166
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:08,468
Larry.

167
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,054
Is it still dripping?

168
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,431
Drip's turned into leaks.

169
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:37,289
He had 'em drive
up and down 400 East several times.

170
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,708
440 South is mentioned four times.

171
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:43,504
So is 250 East and 375 South.

172
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:45,422
This is pointless.

173
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,716
He took 'em up and down
550 East the most.

174
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,636
Six times the first time.
Five times the second.

175
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:56,475
Okay. 550 intersects with 400
at that gas station.

176
00:16:56,975 --> 00:17:00,270
Maybe they stopped
for sodas and bathroom breaks.

177
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:03,625
I doubt that gas station was there.

178
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:04,816
That looked pretty new.

179
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:06,527
So, what was there?

180
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:14,617
Here it is.

181
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:21,458
Construction at 550-400 intersection.

182
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,781
Hey, there a manager around?

183
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,705
Dale only comes
in a couple times a week.

184
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:43,207
The rest of the time?

185
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,627
It's just me and Keith.
He works the 3:00 to 11:00.

186
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:48,545
How long you been here?

187
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:49,922
Since 6:00.

188
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,841
No, not today.
How long have you worked here?

189
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,468
Six months.

190
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,971
Would you know
how long this place has been open?

191
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,307
A few years, I think.

192
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,309
Dale and Keith know exactly?

193
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,562
Dale's been here since the beginning.

194
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,439
Got his number?

195
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:11,693
Thank you.

196
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:16,198
You work on cars here?

197
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:17,908
No, sir.

198
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,243
Know anybody who does?

199
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,703
Not local, no.

200
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,127
Where's the nearest auto parts dealer
around here?

201
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:35,092
I don't know. Not into cars.

202
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:38,846
John Dickey though…

203
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,224
"John Dickey though," what?

204
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:43,767
He's like a Mr. Fixit.

205
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:46,252
People bring him stuff
to fix sometimes,

206
00:19:46,276 --> 00:19:48,276
but it ain't, like, official.

207
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:50,524
Uh-huh. John Dickey?

208
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,527
John Dickey Hansen.
He runs a bait shop up the road.

209
00:19:58,574 --> 00:19:59,783
Okay, thanks.

210
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:12,212
The manager said the station opened
in the spring of '94.

211
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:17,759
He says he believes they broke ground
around midsummer of '93.

212
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,515
Fucking Larry Hall.

213
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,828
I heard you tried to get
some product in here.

214
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:48,790
Don't do that.

215
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,711
A shrug is a nonanswer,

216
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:56,048
and a nonanswer is disrespectful.

217
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,341
I thought about it,

218
00:20:57,424 --> 00:21:00,427
but it turned out
I couldn't get it in here.

219
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:09,102
But let's say you had.

220
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:13,440
And you used it
to dig someone out of some trouble

221
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:15,025
they're having on the outside.

222
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:24,201
Now, that would help them.
Maybe it'd help you.

223
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,287
But I don't see how it would help me.

224
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,207
I'm not sure I understand.

225
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:44,221
A man who can't get help anywhere else
eventually comes to me.

226
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:47,599
And then he's in my debt.

227
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:53,146
My apologies. Sincerely.

228
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,358
I fucked up. I had no idea.

229
00:21:58,485 --> 00:21:59,778
All right.

230
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:07,536
I asked around about you. In Milwaukee.

231
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,624
You checked out. Flying colors.

232
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:18,380
Everyone knew someone who knew someone
who knew you and spoke highly of you.

233
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,174
That's nice.

234
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:31,435
But no one could remember
laying eyes on you directly.

235
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,773
Everyone knew someone
who said they had,

236
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:41,236
but no one had
actually done it themselves.

237
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,364
What do you make of that?

238
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:47,868
They need to get out more.

239
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,250
Is that what they need to do?

240
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,355
Do you have kids?

241
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:19,399
How was your week, Larry?

242
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:20,984
I'm just asking.

243
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:23,487
Would you describe it as productive?

244
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,072
I'm just asking!

245
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:29,618
And you have asked before.
Several times over the years.

246
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:32,454
And what has been my response?

247
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,082
I'm just curious.

248
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,417
What has been my response?

249
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:42,631
You don't discuss your personal life.

250
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:44,758
Correct.

251
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:47,845
That's all that I discuss.

252
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:50,138
Because you are the patient,
and I am the doctor.

253
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:57,521
Can't we try, like, role reversal?

254
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,940
Isn't that therapeutic?

255
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,319
And what would you say to me
if you were my doctor?

256
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:07,739
Bitch, tell me your dreams!

257
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:17,875
I bet they smell good.

258
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,377
Your children.

259
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:24,423
What's troubling you?

260
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:25,507
Nothing.

261
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:28,760
You often use provocation
to mask vulnerability.

262
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:34,349
I'm not vulnerable. You're vulnerable.

263
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:37,436
You seem agitated.

264
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:39,855
I'm perfectly fucking fine.

265
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:44,868
It's the best mood
I've been in for years,

266
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,217
and you don't like it.

267
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:50,032
Why wouldn't I like it?

268
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:53,660
Because if I got better

269
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:57,164
and I told people how,

270
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:59,374
and then those people got better…

271
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,756
you'd have no job.

272
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:09,468
Then I'd retire.

273
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:11,970
You... Then you'd retire.

274
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:16,642
And have tea with your daughters.

275
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:22,147
Watch them bend over
to do their gardening.

276
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:25,234
What's making you feel so good?

277
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:27,694
My appeal.

278
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:30,822
You have fresh news about it?

279
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:34,618
Let's just say

280
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:38,664
that there are positive signs
if you know how to read them.

281
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:42,376
That would explain your affect.

282
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:44,169
What's my affect?

283
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:46,755
Confident.

284
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:49,800
Almost cocky.

285
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:57,182
Sometimes a man has
every reason to feel that way.

286
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,479
Well, I've seen you confident before.

287
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:03,564
When?

288
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:08,569
When you talk about Civil War history
and engines and old car parts.

289
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:12,489
I've just never seen you cocky.

290
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,285
That seems more like your friend.

291
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:18,829
What friend?

292
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:22,749
You mean James.

293
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:28,172
You know who I mean, Larry.
He's very charismatic.

294
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:29,840
You've met him?

295
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:31,967
Our paths crossed.

296
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,888
I see what you respond to in him.

297
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:41,518
He gives off the aura
of someone who's never known regret.

298
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:45,022
He decides something, he does it.
He never looks back.

299
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:51,862
You'd think that, but…

300
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:57,201
Well, but he has known regret.

301
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:58,911
He does regret things.

302
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:00,746
He has known pain.

303
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:06,627
But he doesn't,
you know, let it warp him.

304
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:12,049
Is that how you see yourself?
Warped by pain?

305
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,053
Not lately.

306
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:20,766
Because of James.

307
00:27:26,772 --> 00:27:27,773
I'm…

308
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:31,860
I'm not alone anymore.

309
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,625
<i>When I was in seventh grade,</i>

310
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:49,294
<i>Cooper Ross told me, "You're so nice,"</i>

311
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:50,712
<i>and then he turned red</i>

312
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:53,298
<i>and couldn't look me in the eyes
for a few minutes.</i>

313
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:19,116
Hello.

314
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:42,806
Help you?

315
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,725
Are you John Dickey Hansen?

316
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:47,352
Well, you can call me JD, if you like.

317
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:49,688
You sell auto parts here?

318
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:51,993
Well, if I happen
across something that's

319
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:53,734
worth putting an ad
in the Auto Trader,

320
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:54,818
I might do so.

321
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:56,570
You ever meet this guy?

322
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:00,490
That's Larry.

323
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:02,367
So, you know him well?

324
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:03,869
No, miss.

325
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:07,289
He's just memorable.

326
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,458
Those mutton chops, whatnot.

327
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:12,294
Help me out with "whatnot."

328
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:19,927
He's as creepy as all fuck, you know?
Excuse me.

329
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,221
No, speak freely.

330
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,806
Well, I sold him a pair
of slotted brake rotors

331
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,184
for a '79 Dodge B200

332
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:31,230
back about, I don't know, '92, '93.

333
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,649
Seemed a harmless squirt of a fella.

334
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:36,276
Had that look of somebody
who'd never been hugged.

335
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,445
Not even as a baby.

336
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:43,242
You know,
I guess I was too kind to him,

337
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:47,079
'cause he started coming back
even when he didn't need a part.

338
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:52,459
Started just hanging around,
talking up the young girls.

339
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:55,003
Anything ever happen?

340
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:58,590
What do you mean, like bad? No.

341
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:00,342
We run him off after a while.

342
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:03,637
Every now and then
I wonder what ever became of him.

343
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:09,017
Since you're coming around
asking about him, figure it ain't good.

344
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:11,436
Why'd you run him off?

345
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:15,691
He made too many of the girls
uncomfortable.

346
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:17,776
Including my own.

347
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:21,613
Audrey.

348
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:26,118
She was a teenager then,
but Larry took a shine to her.

349
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:28,912
Sure didn't sit right with me.

350
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:30,706
Is Audrey around?

351
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:34,626
She's in town running some errands.
Should be back soon.

352
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:38,338
You mind if we wait around?

353
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:40,924
Not in the least.

354
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:57,566
<i>When I was 12,
my sister and I got new sneakers.</i>

355
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:03,780
<i>And almost immediately,
we stepped in cow pies,</i>

356
00:31:03,864 --> 00:31:06,992
<i>even though our parents told us
to stay clear of that field.</i>

357
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:19,463
<i>Took hours for those shoes to dry.</i>

358
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:27,346
<i>I don't remember
anything we talked about.</i>

359
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,392
<i>Just that we were happy.</i>

360
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:42,361
Be a good boy.
You listen to your mother.

361
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:43,695
I don't wanna hear this…

Hang up the fucking phone!

372
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:44,173
This phone?

373
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:55,601
Be my guest.

374
00:32:58,395 --> 00:32:59,980
…please enter your account number.

375
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,656
…snitch.

376
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:15,913
Can't have that on the yard.

377
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:38,519
…snitch.

378
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:56,089
Yes, sir. I understand
what you're saying,

379
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,038
but I'm telling you
there must be a mistake

380
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:00,666
because I paid that credit card myself
just last week.

381
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:04,503
You're telling me that my son
can't make or receive calls?

382
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:06,088
Is that what you're telling me?

383
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,551
Okay, sir, please.

384
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:15,054
How about if I give you the credit card
right here, right now, over the phone.

385
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:17,014
Would you be able to connect me then?

386
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:21,562
Okay. All right. Thank you.

387
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:24,063
I appreciate you trying to help.

388
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:32,072
Bitch. Motherfucker.

389
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:35,158
Jim, I should come with you.

390
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:38,704
No, hon. I'll be fine.
I just need to clear my head.

391
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:41,956
Okay. Well, don't get
yourself worked up.

392
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:45,377
I'm taking a drive to relax,
not to get worked up.

393
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,045
All right.

394
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:49,339
Can you pick us up some Kahlúa
on your way back?

395
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,716
Yeah, imagine that.

396
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:07,065
Woodshop.

397
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:08,984
What's that?

398
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:10,777
Last place I saw Larry.

399
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:32,132
How long you been working on those?

400
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:35,469
Couple of weeks.

401
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:42,518
What do you do with them?

402
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:47,356
I send them home.

403
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:51,026
Why?

404
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:56,740
Donny said that you
almost got into a fight today.

405
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:57,950
At the phones?

406
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,285
Yeah, some con wanted the phone.

407
00:36:01,203 --> 00:36:04,206
There's some mess-up with my account.
I can't make calls out.

408
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:06,291
But you funded the account?

409
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:12,297
Maybe you made an enemy.

410
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:15,592
Of who?

411
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:18,804
Someone who works here.

412
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:22,266
Have you had any disagreements
with anyone lately?

413
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:30,649
I had some minor words
with a guard yesterday.

414
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:34,278
Can't remember the guy's name,
but he was just busting my balls.

415
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:36,572
About what?

416
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:38,115
Nothing.

417
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:41,201
It's not nothing.

418
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:44,788
James, come on. It's me.

419
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,209
It was about you, Larry.

420
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:56,258
Why would some guard talk about me?

421
00:36:58,385 --> 00:36:59,386
He said…

422
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:09,438
He said you're a kid-diddler.

423
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:13,192
And a kid-killer.

424
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:18,989
I don't mean to laugh, I just...

425
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:23,327
A kid-diddler?

426
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:28,248
I've never raped
anyone in my life, James.

427
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:36,840
So, what did you do?

428
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:39,968
I had sex with them.

429
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:42,679
Okay.

430
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:45,682
And they weren't children, James.

431
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:50,979
Not until recently.
I mean, not back in the 1800s.

432
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:52,606
Sure.

433
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:59,655
James, how many women have you fucked?

434
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,826
- Since high school? I mean…
- No, not high school.

435
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,328
I mean how many women have...

436
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:11,667
You know, over the high school ages,
have you fucked?

437
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:19,508
- Eighty.
- What?

438
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:22,678
- Eighty?
- I guess.

439
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:25,681
I mean, there's probably
one or two I'm forgetting about,

440
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:29,643
but I'm not totally sure the figure.

441
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:33,021
That's not funny, James. Is it 80?

442
00:38:33,856 --> 00:38:34,940
Yeah.

443
00:38:35,524 --> 00:38:36,608
How?

444
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:40,195
How did you manage to... How...

445
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,490
- Do you have like a line you use?
- No.

446
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:48,453
I just... I mean, I talk to 'em.

447
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:52,666
And they talk to me,
and eventually, our clothes come off.

448
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:54,501
- But how?
- I just told you.

449
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:56,044
No you didn't.

450
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:01,383
I don't follow, Larry. I'm sorry.

451
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:07,389
No woman will ever just "talk to me."

452
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:13,729
But younger girls will.

453
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:14,897
Some.

454
00:39:15,564 --> 00:39:16,565
Yeah.

455
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:28,118
She was nice at first.

456
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:31,747
Who's that?

457
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,336
- Who was nice, Larry?
- Jessica Roach.

458
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:45,928
Her bike had a flat,
she was driving up this gravel road.

459
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:47,447
Even though she had a mountain bike...

460
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:49,932
You know, rocks and gravel
mix in with each other

461
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:51,725
and rocks can be sharp, so…

462
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:57,689
Girls think they're so smart,
but there she was with a flat.

463
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:04,238
You fix it?

464
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:07,741
- Oh, no. I just offered her a ride.
- Right.

465
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:13,247
They make it sound like I jump
on these girls, James, and attack them.

466
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,832
That's not reflective of the truth.

467
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:18,752
She liked talking to me. She did.

468
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:23,131
I had my bike that day,
and I opened up the doors to the van

469
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:24,842
and I showed her, and…

470
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:28,887
I told her how much I like cycling,
and we talked about that.

471
00:40:28,971 --> 00:40:31,598
Sounds like you had no trouble
talking to her, Larry.

472
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:32,683
None.

473
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:35,477
Yeah, she was nice, like I said.

474
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,230
Until she wasn't.

475
00:40:41,024 --> 00:40:42,317
She turned on you, huh?

476
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:46,697
Like a rabid squirrel, just

477
00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:51,285
You remember why?

478
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,500
Why are you asking?

479
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:06,049
Shit, Larry,
I thought we were just talking.

480
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:08,927
Is that what we're doing?

481
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:15,017
That's what I'm doing.

482
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:25,360
She got into my van just fine.

483
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:29,615
She looked at my bike
and my cleaning supplies.

484
00:41:31,575 --> 00:41:37,289
She asked if I live locally,
and why I had such big burnsides.

485
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:38,999
She called them sideburns.

486
00:41:42,044 --> 00:41:44,463
I told her about reenactments,

487
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:47,549
and she asked really good questions,
you know?

488
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:52,095
She was so curious and so smart.

489
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:58,018
And so I kissed her.

490
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:07,236
And that's when she turned mean.
Just awful, slapping me and hitting me.

491
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:10,697
And I just had to rag her
with the starter fluid.

492
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:12,824
I had to.

493
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:19,289
So we drove for a little while.

494
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:23,043
I was trying to find, like,
a nice, quiet, little place.

495
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:26,129
And I did,
even though I didn't know where I was

496
00:42:26,213 --> 00:42:29,800
or where we were going,
but I found one.

497
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:34,513
Then what happened?

498
00:42:35,973 --> 00:42:37,891
I... Well, I, you know.

499
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:42,023
I went into
the back of the van with her,

500
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,047
and I ragged her
a few more times.

501
00:42:44,523 --> 00:42:45,774
She kept waking up?

502
00:42:48,777 --> 00:42:50,404
She scratched me.

503
00:42:51,488 --> 00:42:53,490
So hard. It was deep.

504
00:42:54,283 --> 00:42:58,245
And when I cleaned out the flesh
from under her nails later on,

505
00:42:58,328 --> 00:43:00,038
there was a lot of me under there.

506
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:01,874
A lot of me.

507
00:43:01,957 --> 00:43:03,166
You have sex with her?

508
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,627
I knew you were gonna ask that.
No... It's weird.

509
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:08,672
I don't totally remember.

510
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:13,635
It was like I blacked out,
but then it was like I was in a dream

511
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:17,139
where I see myself
beating on her and ragging her,

512
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:18,807
beating on her and ragging her.

513
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:24,396
And then I woke up,
and her clothes were off,

514
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:25,898
and my clothes were off.

515
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:29,401
So, I…

516
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:34,323
I think we had sex together.

517
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,956
Sure sounds like it, buddy.

518
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:00,182
Well, then she started to cry.

519
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:08,732
Sometimes they do that.

520
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:10,275
They thought they wanted it,

521
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:12,945
but they changed their mind
after the fact.

522
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:15,155
Well, no,
she was crying for her mother.

523
00:44:19,284 --> 00:44:20,410
She was, huh?

524
00:44:21,286 --> 00:44:23,288
"I want my mommy.

525
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:28,001
Just take me to my mommy."

526
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:30,921
I did not like that.

527
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:33,340
It made me mad. It ruined everything.

528
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:35,425
So, I took her out of the van,

529
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:38,345
and I walked her
pretty far back into the field.

530
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:43,267
And I found this tree,
and I had made this…

531
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:49,606
Tool, I guess, that I had made
by putting two leather belts together.

532
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:51,859
And I had this stick...

533
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:56,280
Well, I told her to sit down
with her back against the tree.

534
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,242
I didn't want to see
her face, you know?

535
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:02,744
And,

536
00:45:03,412 --> 00:45:07,499
So yeah, so then I quickly whipped
the two belts around her neck,

537
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:10,961
and I squeezed and put the stick in.

538
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:13,630
I just started twisting it,
like one of those…

539
00:45:16,008 --> 00:45:17,384
What do you call it…

540
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:20,554
- Tourniquet?
- Tourniquet, exactly.

541
00:45:22,264 --> 00:45:23,265
Yeah.

542
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:27,978
I just kept twisting
until she stopped making…

543
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:32,107
You know.

544
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:35,652
Sounds.

545
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:49,750
Well, it sounds like
you did what you had to do.

546
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:06,975
Never said anything totally gross,
just off.

547
00:46:07,476 --> 00:46:09,061
Always off.

548
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:10,979
How?

549
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:15,442
He'd be like,
"You have really pretty ankles."

550
00:46:15,526 --> 00:46:18,654
Or, said to me once,
"Your earlobes are very ripe."

551
00:46:18,737 --> 00:46:20,364
That was Larry making small talk.

552
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:24,159
Other times, he'd just sit at one of
the picnic benches and just stare.

553
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,538
And, if it got to you
like sometimes it did,

554
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:30,624
you'd be like, "Larry, what's up?"

555
00:46:30,707 --> 00:46:33,627
And he'd be all, "Did you know
that most cleaners contain lye?"

556
00:46:34,211 --> 00:46:37,673
And then he'd want you to go to his van
and look at the list of ingredients.

557
00:46:37,756 --> 00:46:40,175
- Did you ever go?
- Fuck no.

558
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:42,219
You know anyone who did?

559
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:46,348
Not around here, no.
We were all creeped out by him.

560
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,518
Then, when he started to give me stuff…

561
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:50,811
He gave you stuff?

562
00:46:52,855 --> 00:46:54,273
A pair of earrings once.

563
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:56,275
A locket.

564
00:46:56,817 --> 00:46:58,819
Pair of used ballet flats.

565
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,988
Were they your size?

566
00:47:04,408 --> 00:47:06,785
Yep. Made it worse.

567
00:47:07,828 --> 00:47:09,788
No chance you kept any of this stuff?

568
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,417
We have a lost and found sale
at the end of every season.

569
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:18,213
There is one thing
that I didn't throw away.

570
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:52,539
Last time we ever saw him,
he gave me that.

571
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:56,877
I never rode it, not once.

572
00:47:58,003 --> 00:48:00,672
Every time I look at it,
it makes me wanna take a shower.

573
00:48:24,655 --> 00:48:26,698
<i>My mother said I was never any trouble</i>

574
00:48:26,782 --> 00:48:28,867
<i>except when I fixated
on something I wanted,</i>

575
00:48:28,951 --> 00:48:30,661
<i>like a dog on a pork chop.</i>

576
00:48:31,411 --> 00:48:34,122
<i>So that's what she'd call it.
My pork chop.</i>

577
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:38,001
<i>When I was six,
my pork chop was a goldfish.</i>

578
00:48:38,794 --> 00:48:42,047
<i>When I was nine,
it was a pack of butterfly hair clips.</i>

579
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,131
<i>Multicolored.</i>

580
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:47,219
<i>But my biggest pork chop,
the one I obsessed over</i>

581
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:50,180
<i>and had to wait
until my 13th birthday for,</i>

582
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:52,558
<i>and still work off
five months' allowance to get,</i>

583
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:56,562
<i>was a mountain bike.</i>

584
00:49:25,257 --> 00:49:28,802
<i>I did the math.
I lived over 5,000 days.</i>

585
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:32,472
<i>Over 135,000 hours.</i>

586
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:34,391
<i>All that time was mine.</i>

587
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:40,189
<i>You can die, but you can't un-live.</i>

588
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:41,899
<i>I lived.</i>

589
00:49:42,816 --> 00:49:43,817
<i>Here.</i>

590
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:48,530
<i>Here.</i>

591
00:49:53,493 --> 00:49:54,578
<i>Here.</i>

592
00:49:58,373 --> 00:49:59,374
<i>And here.</i>

593
00:50:01,502 --> 00:50:02,628
<i>It was great.</i>

594
00:50:21,688 --> 00:50:22,731
It's not enough.

595
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:24,441
That's bullshit.

596
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,069
Heard of chain of evidence?

597
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:29,947
We have a witness
who swears Hall gave it to her.

598
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:32,824
Where's the serial number of the bike?

599
00:50:33,325 --> 00:50:35,369
Someone burned it off with acid.

600
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:39,164
There's no way to conclusively prove
that this is Jessica Roach's,

601
00:50:39,248 --> 00:50:42,793
unless matching fingerprints
of both Hall and Roach are found on it.

602
00:50:42,876 --> 00:50:46,338
And after four years,
I'm fairly confident it won't be.

603
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:49,508
We have witnesses who place
Larry Hall in the area…

604
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:51,218
I'm not trying a new case here.

605
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:53,011
Where he claimed
to have buried Reitler…

606
00:50:53,095 --> 00:50:55,097
I'm defending against a second appeal.

607
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:58,016
And where he gave someone
Jessica Roach's bike.

608
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,810
It's not enough.

609
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:04,189
Not even close.

610
00:51:05,274 --> 00:51:06,650
But you did great work here.

611
00:51:07,526 --> 00:51:10,988
You did. This is top-fucking-notch.

612
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:13,407
Hey, look at me.

613
00:51:18,662 --> 00:51:21,582
You did. But it's not enough.

614
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:24,168
What would be enough?

615
00:51:29,381 --> 00:51:30,507
I don't know.

616
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:33,886
But this ain't it.

617
00:52:29,274 --> 00:52:30,275
James?

618
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,404
James.

619
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:38,659
James, you up?

620
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:43,455
Well, good night.

621
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:51,046
Sleep well.
