1
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,041
- Young gentleman.
- Thank you.

2
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,125
Do you care to sign
the book of remembrance?

3
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:31,541
I'll sign.

4
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:07,041
Slim maintained
throughout his long imprisonment

5
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:10,708
that he was innocent of the crime
for which he was convicted.

6
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:14,208
But he also believed
that he deserved his sentence

7
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:18,250
for past misdeeds
which had gone unpunished.

8
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:22,083
"Do your time before it does you"

9
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,000
was the epitaph he chose for himself.

10
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:30,083
By which I think he meant
that none of us goes through life

11
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:34,500
without committing certain acts
they have reason to be ashamed of.

12
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:39,250
But as long as we are living,
we have time to make amends

13
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,333
for these transgressions.

14
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:44,958
We shall now play
one of Slim's favorite songs.

15
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:51,375
♪ Well, if I needed you ♪

16
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,208
♪ Would you come to me? ♪

17
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,500
♪ Would you come to me ♪

18
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,541
♪ And ease my pain? ♪

19
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,750
♪ You will miss sunrise ♪

20
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,250
♪ If you close your eyes ♪

21
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:13,541
♪ That would break my heart in two ♪

22
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,666
Excuse me?

23
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,375
-You're George Masoumi.
-Yeah, I know that. Who are you?

24
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,916
Uh, I'm Eli Bell. Slim said that you might
be able to help me with something.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Slim's dead now.
Help you with what?

26
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,916
I need to get a parcel to my mum
in Boggo Road Gaol.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,125
Sorry, mate, I wouldn't know
anything about that.

28
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,750
Just a package of stuff
that she's gonna need over Christmas.

29
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,458
I'm a fruiterer, mate.
I do fruit deliveries.

30
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,708
I can pay good money.

31
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:12,250
Well, any grocery requirements,
you know where to find me.

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Eli.

33
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh. Hello.

34
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:25,291
I've been tryin' to contact you.
Thought I might find you here.

35
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,125
You were right about the tattoo.

36
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,250
I know your stepdad's missing
and your mum's in prison.

37
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,083
You said you had a story to tell.

38
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,000
About men who did terrible things.

39
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,166
Yeah, well, I, uh-- I changed my mind.
Sort of.

40
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,916
Everyone says that I should
just keep quiet about… stuff.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,041
So, um, that's what I'm gonna do. For now.

42
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,791
Okay. But you realize
that if nobody ever says anything,

43
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,500
the bad guys just keep winning?

44
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,375
I reckon they'll keep winning anyway.

45
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,000
Maybe another time, eh?

46
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,541
Okay.

47
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,750
But you can call me, anytime.

48
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,875
They gave me his picture.

49
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,333
Hey!

50
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,333
Tinker Bell, what is all this shit?

51
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,375
Give that back, please. It's important.

52
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,416
- Oh yeah, pass it here.
- Leave it!

53
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,791
Wanna get it?

54
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,500
- Chill out, mate.
- Hey!

55
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,708
Give that back. Come on.

56
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,166
Fooled you.

57
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,041
- No!
- Brutal.

58
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,875
-Have fun.
-See ya.

59
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,916
Oh no.

60
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,750
Hi, we're collecting
for muscular dystrophy.

61
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,083
Is that what you've got?

62
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:10,083
Yeah, well, if we raise 70 grand,
the school can put in ramps and stuff

63
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,458
so I can still go to class.

64
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,375
Seventy grand?
That's a lot of fuckin' ramps.

65
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,083
There's a lot of fuckin' kids out there
who can't fuckin' walk.

66
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,541
-How much you raised so far?
-About 2,000, mostly from school fete.

67
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,625
So, bugger all, basically.

68
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,416
If you give us a tenner, that'll be 2,010.

69
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,166
Ah, good on youse.

70
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,958
I guess it is Christmas.

71
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,500
Oh, and you can, uh, miss out on 14.
She's a right hard-ass.

72
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,166
Why are you doing this, Gus?

73
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,416
Because I like you.

74
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,416
You know there's a lot more fun things
you could be doing instead of this.

75
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,875
Vandalizing bus stops like normal kids?

76
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,791
How do you feel
about changing adult nappies?

77
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,666
'Cause that's where
this is heading, you know.

78
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,833
Well, that's somethin' to look forward to.

79
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,416
And then after that,
you'll just have to watch me dying.

80
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,458
Everyone's dying, Shells.
You've always been ahead of the pack.

81
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,750
-You just wanna go to bed with me.
-No.

82
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,166
I'm in it for the nappies.

83
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,208
George?

84
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,666
Here's the money you lent me.

85
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,000
For my mum.

86
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,208
Here, then.

87
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,125
Fuck off.

88
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,208
How much did you get?

89
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,125
Couple hundred.

90
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:42,708
Eh…

91
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,250
Doin' a good thing there, mate.

92
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,541
You don't-- You don't reckon I could, uh…

93
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,583
I'm just kiddin'.

94
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,875
-Don't forget to keep up with school work.
-Yep, I won't.

95
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,166
What've we got here?
Still nothing from your mum?

96
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,208
No.

97
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,833
You know I'd take youse if I could.

98
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,500
Honestly, but, uh,

99
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,291
there's just too much history.

100
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,666
And she still blames me
for you not talking and all.

101
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,791
-She doesn't blame you.
-Yeah, she does.

102
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,833
I blame me sometimes.

103
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,166
She thinks I messed up your brain
with what happened.

104
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,125
My brain's fine.

105
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:39,916
Hey.

106
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,541
I know that.

107
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,458
I know it is.

108
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,416
I wish mine bloody was.

109
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,791
Ah, we all have our struggles.

110
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,083
Yeah.

111
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,958
Oi, Frankie, there's a package for you.

112
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:13,833
Oh…

113
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,500
Hey, Mum.
Been tryin' to contact you for ages,

114
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,458
but no, I don't think
our letters are getting through.

115
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,208
Hope you're doing okay in there.

116
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,208
Me and Gus made a mixtape of songs

117
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,583
so you've got something
to listen to for Christmas.

118
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,875
Please write back so we know
you've got this and you're okay.

Thought it was you.

131
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,416
Ah.

132
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,916
Hi, Darren.

133
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,041
So, what you been up to?

134
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,750
You don't call. You don't write.

135
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:20,208
You know, the usual.
Tryin' to keep my dad off the booze.

136
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,875
Getting picked on by Bobby Linyette.

137
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,291
-Bobby's a dick.
-I thought you and him were pals?

138
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,458
Pals can be dicks.

139
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,958
Can you tell him to leave me alone?

140
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,333
Tell him yourself.
I got bigger dickheads to deal with.

141
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,833
-Hear about my mum?
-No.

142
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,750
She had a stroke or some shit.
She can hardly walk now.

143
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,500
That's terrible, man.

144
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,666
She's still pretty pissed about it.

145
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,000
That's why I had to take over.
She's not so happy about that either.

146
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,291
So, what are you doing
at the back of FunWorld?

147
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,291
Dustin Vang owns this joint.

148
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,708
He's trying to muscle his way
into my mum's wholesale business.

149
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,208
Wholesale of what?

150
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,958
Ornamental pot plants.
What do you fuckin' think?

151
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,333
I'm still figuring out
how to scare the shit out of him.

152
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:10,000
-Have you tried negotiating with him?
-We're talking about a major dickhead.

153
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,208
The only language these bastards
understand is violence.

154
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,625
Bobby Linyette included.

155
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,833
Did you ever find Lyle's stash?

156
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:21,875
No.

157
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,208
Someone had taken it.

158
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,125
Wasn't me, if that's what you're thinking.

159
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,083
Did your mum ever say
what happened to Lyle?

160
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,541
Why would she know about that?

161
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,916
Your mum was the main importer,
and Ivan Kroll was the standover man.

162
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,791
The story I heard
was that your dad's pal ratted him out.

163
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,166
-And Ivan Kroll sorted it.
-Wait, what pal?

164
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,875
You know, the one who's
always sniffing around your mum.

165
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,125
Not Teddy Kallas?

166
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,125
The rat's always closest
to the cheese.

167
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,958
Eli, we're late.

168
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,291
Eli!

169
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,625
- I think they've already started.
- I'm coming.

170
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:30,291
Nice school bag, Eli.
Your mum make that in prison for you?

171
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,125
Oh, nice. Right on the spot.

172
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,500
Ow!

173
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,791
- No way!
- Eli's bashing Bobby.

174
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,541
Leave me alone or I'll kill you,
you hear me?

175
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,666
You're dead, Bobby!
I mean it, I'll kill you.

176
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,291
Eli, come on. Leave it.

177
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,875
Get off me!

178
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,416
- Fuck!
- Get off of me!

179
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,416
I've had enough of this shit.

180
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
No more Mr. Nice Guy, okay?

181
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,000
-No more Mr. Nice Guy.
-Come on, it's not worth it.

182
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,208
No more!

183
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:23,041
"In the end, I got two days' suspension
'cause of special circumstances."

184
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,625
"It's Christmas holidays comin' up,
so I'm not gonna miss much."

185
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,583
"You said you were thinking
of doing a psychology course,

186
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,666
so I found a book on it
in Dad's book pile."

187
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,375
"I'm gettin' really worried about you,
Mum, 'cause you haven't written back."

188
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:41,083
"Please let us know you're okay.
We love you, Mum."

189
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,041
"And we're countin' down the days
till you get home again."

190
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:48,375
"1,451 sleeps to go." Yeah.

191
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:50,958
Frankie?

192
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,458
Are you hearing this?

193
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:55,708
Frankie!

194
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,250
Yeah, you let me know
if you need a rest there, Gus.

195
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,750
- Yeah.
- All right.

196
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,583
Eli, get my back. Thanks, mate.

197
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,958
Sorry, crap-dusted you, mate.

198
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,625
The fire started late last night.

199
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:17,375
While there was no loss of life,
foul play cannot yet be discounted.

200
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,500
We gotta be real careful
about where we put 'im.

201
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:26,208
Not too much sun and not too much breeze.

202
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,125
Why not?

203
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:32,083
Well, 'cause Henry's
a very sensitive soul. He's a weeping fig.

204
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,166
And if we upset him, he will weep.

205
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,666
He will turn on the waterworks
first opportunity he gets.

206
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,666
-Just, uh, like our little mate Eli here.
-No, I don't.

207
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,625
Oh, come on. You used to love a good sook
when you were a bub.

208
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,125
Surprised you remember.

209
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,875
Yeah, okay. Let's decorate him, shall we?

210
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,125
I reckon that's for you.

211
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,833
All right.

212
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,541
That's the way, go on.

213
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,958
Nice. Nice. Let me just pop her up here.

214
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,083
Keep things holy.

215
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,000
There we go. I reckon that's beautiful.
What do you reckon?

216
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,791
We can put our presents around the bottom,
just like in the movies.

217
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,666
-You actually got us presents?
-Well, no.

218
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,208
But, uh, I… I had an idea.

219
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,250
Uh, I got this Christmas box
comin' from Vinnie's this arvo.

220
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,500
They got some good gear in 'em.
Ya know, a can of ham, pineapple juice,

221
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,958
licorice squares.

222
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:30,208
And I thought that, uh, maybe we could
each choose a book from the pile,

223
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,708
wrap it up, and put it
under the tree for each other.

224
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,500
You know, I mean, not just any book.

225
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,916
Ya know, maybe something
that you been reading

226
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,750
or maybe something you think
someone else might enjoy.

227
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,875
Anyway, here, got some names.
Just pick a name.

228
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,041
Who'd you get?

229
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,125
All right, so Gus picks a book for me,

230
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:53,375
I pick a book for Eli,
Eli picks a book for Gus.

231
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,958
We sit around drinkin' pineapple juice,
eatin' licorice squares,

232
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,250
I might have a beer,
and we can read our books together.

233
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,666
So how is that different
from any other day?

234
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,708
It's Christmas.

235
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,000
What's that for?

236
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,375
You will stick around for it,
won't you? Yeah?

237
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:12,333
Sure. You know, it's Christmas.
Why wouldn't I?

238
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,833
Yeah, that's the way.

239
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,416
Good one.

240
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:20,708
Dear Alex.

241
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,083
It's nearly Christmas,

242
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,375
and we still haven't heard
anything from Mum.

243
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,416
I've decided I can't wait any longer.

244
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,708
It's time to do something drastic.

245
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:33,708
Hi, George.

246
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:38,125
- You again.
- Get anything back from my mum?

247
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,500
Sorry, mate.

248
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,125
-I have a question.
-Okay, well, just make it quick, I'm busy.

249
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,291
What's the biggest thing
you've ever smuggled into Boggo Road?

250
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,083
What size were you thinking?

251
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,833
My size.

252
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,166
Just forget it.

253
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,291
Well, there's laws
against breaking out of prison.

254
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,500
Who says you can't break in?

255
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,000
No one says it
because no one's that stupid.

256
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,708
Yeah, but suppose someone was?

257
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,791
Move, all right? I'm not gonna do it.

258
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,291
Slim said you owed him one.

259
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,291
He said he got your brother
through a tough stretch of porridge once.

260
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,541
He wasn't lying.

261
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,833
He said your brother
wouldn't have made it without it.

262
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:22,875
No, he probably wouldn't.

263
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,083
So now it's my mum who's behind the bars,

264
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:29,125
and I'm worried that she's not gonna be
able to take it, you know?

265
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,958
Not seeing us for Christmas and stuff.

266
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:38,375
And I'm worried that she's gonna get back
on the smack and OD.

267
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:46,458
That's why I need to see her again,
to show her how much we really care.

268
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,625
And to tell her
that everything's gonna be all right now.

269
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,708
- I dunno, mate.
- Look…

270
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,666
I know that it's a big ask.

271
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:07,041
But you wouldn't be doing it for me,
you'd be doing it for Slim.

272
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,083
We said you weren't gonna do this.

273
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,458
It's Mum, Gus.

274
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,750
-I have to.
-What if they lock you up?

275
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,458
Well, they'll have to catch me first.

276
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,250
It's a fucking prison, Eli.

277
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,375
Stopping people from running away
is kinda what they do there.

278
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,750
Unless you break your neck
tryin' to climb over the wall.

279
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,083
-Is that what's gonna happen?
-I dunno.

280
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,541
I still think it's a stupid idea.

281
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,541
So wish me luck.

282
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,125
Okay, no matter what happens,

283
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,625
you just stay quiet and you wait.

284
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,291
- Okay.
- 'Kay.

285
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,250
Merry Christmas.

286
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,541
Georgie!

287
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,958
Stand by.
Fruit delivery's coming through.

288
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:18,375
Here you are, mate, have that.
No one hiding anything in there?

289
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,750
Officer, you wanna check under the car?

290
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:40,666
Get in there.

291
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,875
Avocados.
Can you believe this shit?

292
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,875
Cherries, rock melons.
Fuck, these bitches eat better than I do.

293
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,833
I mean, to be fair, mate,
they also suck cock better than you do,

294
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,000
so there is that.

295
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,625
Let's get Georgie outta here.

296
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,958
- Jeez.
- All right, George.

297
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:10,958
Good to go, mate.

298
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,250
All right, George, on your bike,
mate. Get outta here.

299
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,625
Officers, let him out.

300
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,291
Tight fit, eh?

301
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:01,625
-You wanna get outta there?
-Yeah. Can you give me a hand up?

302
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,500
I'm Bernie.

303
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,250
Eli.

304
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,125
George told me to expect you.

305
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,333
-You known him long?
-I reckon.

306
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:15,291
I dunno.

307
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:18,708
This has gotta be the first time
he's ever done anything this stupid.

308
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:21,916
Must be gettin' old.

309
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:26,750
-Is this where you make Mum's food?
-Bernie's Bistro.

310
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:30,958
A limited menu,
but, um, never short on customers.

311
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:33,208
So, um, can I go and see Mum now?

312
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:36,625
Mate, have you figured out
where you are yet?

313
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,916
You're inside a women's fucking prison.
It's not like being in a hotel,

314
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,875
where you just phone someone up
and they meet you at reception.

315
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:53,708
Salvos. Everyone's in the dining room
watchin' 'em.

316
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:56,625
-Don't you wanna be in there?
-Fuck no.

317
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:59,958
I hate hymns. Mission girl, me.

318
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,166
And stuff Christmas and stuff the carols,

319
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,500
and fuck 'em singin'
them Christmas fuckin' carols.

320
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:09,500
- Bernie!
- We're in here, Deb.

321
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:13,750
Is this Frankie's kid?

322
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:17,125
Dunno. Got a whole cart
full of 'em out the back, there.

323
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:20,875
You were supposed to bring Frankie
in with you, ya dopey bitch.

324
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:23,291
Yeah, she's gone
and jammed the door shut again.

325
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:25,625
The screw said to just let her stew.

326
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:27,666
Hello.

327
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm Debbie.

328
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,291
Is Mum hooked on drugs again?

329
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:45,083
Look, all I can say
is she's in a dark place, mate.

330
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:47,041
She hasn't been eating much,

331
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:50,666
and I can't remember the last time
she came out for 3:00 p.m. rec.

332
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,333
Yeah, just-- just to warn you.

333
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:58,375
No, she'll come out for me.

334
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:03,500
Christmas is when miracles happen, right?
Just take me to her cell.

335
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:06,041
Soon as she hears my voice,
she'll open up that door.

336
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:09,958
I'm sure the screws will too.
But that's not my problem.

337
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:16,958
All right, eh,
chop chop, in you hop.

338
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,250
What? With all the rubbish?

339
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,125
Just get in the bin.

340
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,833
Now be quiet, and hang on.

341
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,291
Just before I leave you here,

342
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:46,625
if you get caught,
who wheeled you this far?

343
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,250
I couldn't see,
sounded like a white woman.

344
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,958
And how'd you get into this place?

345
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:52,875
I hung on the bottom of a truck.

346
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,000
Which truck?

347
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:56,500
Uh, I dunno. It was carrying prisoners.

348
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:58,250
Right-o.

349
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:05,125

You have to believe in us.

382
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:02,041
Of course I believe.
I always have and I always will.

in my psychology book

489
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:15,375
about how you're most likely
to fall in love with what's familiar.

490
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:19,375
So, the more you're around someone,
the more likely you are to fancy them.

-Mm-hmm.

00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:47,583
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

516
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,791
Yeah, well, I-- I went around
a couple of times already, actually,

517
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:51,875
um, but they wasn't in.

518
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:54,750
I'll go again though,
when I'm not on long distance.

519
00:37:57,666 --> 00:37:59,041
You're a good man, Teddy.

520
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,166
Maybe don't tell 'em I come here though.

521
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:12,583
I-- I just wouldn't want them to think
that I was, um… you know,

522
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,208
like encroaching or…

523
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:16,041
- You're not encroaching.
- No?

524
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:19,333
No, it's always really nice
to see a friendly face.

525
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,416
It's good to see you too, Frankie.

526
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:28,041
- Table nine, no touching.
- We're not touching.

527
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:33,250
We're not fucking touching.
Did you see us touch? Huh?

528
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:41,250
What's with her, huh?

529
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:43,541
That time of the month or something?

530
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:48,833
Uh, well, I'll-- I'll…

531
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:50,000
I'll come back, yeah?

532
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:54,625
- Thanks, Teddy.
- Yeah, 'course.

533
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,875
The owner of FunWorld
is Dustin Vang.

534
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:12,541
He's rumored to import the stuff
through Sydney.

535
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:16,583
The prime suspect is this kid,
son of local importer Bich Dang,

536
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:19,833
who recently retired from the heroin
business due to ill health.

537
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:22,208
It sounds like the conflict
between these two gangs

538
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:24,000
is coming to a head now.

539
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:26,416
If it becomes open warfare,
I'm imagining Dustin Vang

540
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,458
will finally be prosecuted
for his past crimes.

541
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:31,291
Like this one, perhaps.

542
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:34,875
Well, that's assuming
there's anyone left alive to testify.

543
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:39,916
And… …there are no other players
we don't know about.

544
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:44,458
And, Jeffrey, when I said no adverbs,
I did not mean more adjectives.

545
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:47,083
Come on, people! It's four o'clock.

546
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:50,958
Dear Alex.

547
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:53,833
Mum's off the drugs
and doing a lot better now.

548
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,541
Gus and I have been thinking
of part-time jobs

549
00:39:56,625 --> 00:40:00,458
to save for a deposit on a nice house
that Mum can move into when she gets out.

550
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:07,250
We thought we should look
at Lyle's place one more time

551
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:10,541
to see if we can find anything to sell,
if you know what I mean.

552
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:39,333
Oi, come gimme a hand with this.

553
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:48,333
What do you reckon about this?

554
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:50,875
Not sure.

555
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:56,333
Wait, Gus, look at this.

556
00:41:57,958 --> 00:42:00,416
Q, S,

557
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,125
L… G.

558
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:07,125
What's he telling him?

559
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:16,041
Hold on.

560
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:31,458
Holy shit, Batman.

561
00:42:58,833 --> 00:42:59,750
That's it.

562
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:01,458
Hoo!

563
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,000
Oh my God.

564
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:27,750
- How much you think it's worth?
- All up? A hundred grand maybe.

565
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:29,500
What do you reckon we do with it?

566
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,625
Sell it, obviously. To Darren Dang.

567
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,750
Buy Mum a house.

568
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:37,750
I say bury it. We got four years
till Mum gets out of prison.

569
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:40,791
Yeah, but do you think
that Darren will still be around then?

570
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:43,000
The way he's going,
I'm not sure he'll live that long.

571
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:44,875
I could say the same about you.

572
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:48,083
Do you know something that I don't?

573
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:52,541
I know a lot of things you don't,
but I only see bits.

574
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:54,125
Like what?

575
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:56,000
Tell me.

576
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,875
Boys? Dinner's up.

577
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:26,666
-What do you want?
-Hi, I'm Eli Bell.

578
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:28,750
I, uh…

579
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,708
I'm an old school friend of Darren's.

580
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:34,541
I also brought some merchandise
that he might be interested in.

581
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:40,166
Guy with the merchandise.
Said you were in school together.

582
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:41,708
Chin-chin.

583
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:48,833
Nah, never seen him before.

584
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:50,041
What the hell, Darren?

585
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:56,250
I'll check this out, boss.

586
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:05,125
Who are you really?

587
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:07,041
It's me. You know, Tinker Bell.

588
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,291
I reckon he's a spy for the BTK.

589
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:16,958
-He's certainly not 5T.
-Darren, I don't even know what 5T is.

590
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,625
I'm 5T.

591
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:22,958
This is 5T.

592
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:31,416
Love,
Money, Prison, Sin, Revenge.

593
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:38,166
You wanna join?
We've got our own tattooist.

594
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:42,750
Can I think about it?

595
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:46,250
Who is this loser?

596
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:47,791
He's got no respect.

597
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:01,958
Same old Tink. Were you shittin' yourself?

598
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:05,000
Yes.

599
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:15,250
So, how much you asking
for the merchandise?

600
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:16,833
It's a quality product.

601
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,958
It's gotta have appreciated
in value over time.

602
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:22,541
What the f…?

603
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,958
Vang
and his mates are on the lawn.

604
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:28,250
Why let them in?

605
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:30,166
He drove his truck
through the front gates.

606
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,708
He said he'll burn your house down.

607
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:33,625
- They've got weapons.
- Let's move.

608
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:37,083
I told you
torching FunWorld was a bad idea.

609
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:40,083
Put that in the safe.

610
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:46,583
-What's that?
-50K, take it or leave it.

611
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:49,500
- Wait! I haven't finished negotiating yet.
- Yes, you have.

612
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:52,208
The Sydney fuckers are tryin'
to take over our market.

613
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:56,708
What are you looking at?

614
00:46:58,291 --> 00:46:59,416
You want a machete?

615
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,375
What? No fucking way.

616
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:04,041
Suit yourself.

617
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:08,708
Kill!

618
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:25,916
You fucked up my fence.

619
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,625
That's just the start of your problems.
After we burn your fuckin' house down,

620
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:32,333
I'll chop off your dick
and stuff it up in your arse.

621
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:33,916
I think I'll go back inside.

622
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,416
That's very original.

623
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,083
If you don't move your shitty vehicle,
I'll tattoo your face to your ball sack

624
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:42,458
and send it to your mum
to use as a finger puppet.

625
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:48,583
- Kill them all!
- Wait, wait, wait!

626
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:51,333
Look, I know none of you know me
and I don't know any of you,

627
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,333
but I really think
in this kinda situation,

628
00:47:55,416 --> 00:47:57,583
a different point of view can really help.

629
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,291
You fucking kidding me?

630
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:02,583
My stepdad's grandparents
were refugees from World War II.

631
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:07,916
A lot of folks like them came to Darra
fleeing from war and shit.

632
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,625
Your parents could probably tell
the same story.

633
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:12,833
In truth, we're all foreigners here,

634
00:48:12,916 --> 00:48:15,208
but I know we all think
of this place as home now.

635
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:17,250
So why can't we just put down our weapons

636
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:20,166
and sort this out like family,
like neighbors,

637
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:23,500
with a sit-down in the front yard
for a beer and a yarn?

638
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:29,875
So, who's gonna be
the first to shake on that?

639
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,875
Kill them all!

640
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:37,208
Oh, God!

641
00:48:52,291 --> 00:48:53,291
Whoa!

642
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:57,083
Eli?

643
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:07,000
Tell me that's tomato sauce.

644
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,333
Nah, it's actually blood this time.

645
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:13,708
Jesus, Eli, what happened?

646
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:17,833
Check that out. Look in the bag.

647
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:30,875
Fifty thousand in cash.
Deposit on a house for Mum.

648
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:35,333

Everything's working out
