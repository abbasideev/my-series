1
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,375
Check out that cubby house.

2
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,666
It's, like, bigger
than our whole actual bedroom.

3
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,333
Don't exaggerate, Eli.

4
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,666
What's she got six dogs for?

5
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,000
Mate, I reckon she gets paid
to walk 'em for other people.

6
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,458
I'd really like a dog.

7
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,791
Mate, when you learn to pick up
your own poo, then we'll talk, okay?

8
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,875
Just up here. Go right.

9
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,875
Can you believe
this is all one person's house?

10
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,833
If we go in, don't touch anything.

11
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,416
-Hi, we come about the Atari.
-"Came."

12
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,750
About the, um, Atari games console.

13
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,750
Yes. Yes.

14
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:37,750
Uh, my husband hooked it up to the TV
so that you could see that it works.

15
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Um…

16
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,291
-Maybe if just one of you--
-Oh yeah.

17
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,500
We'll just-- We'll wait outside, won't we?

18
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,458
Well, um,
I don't know how to play the thing.

19
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:52,833
Perhaps you children
might know how to play it.

20
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,875
- Yeah.
- Well, then we best go in. Hey, boys?

21
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,916
It plays Space Invaders
and these other games.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,625
Gillie's hardly used it to be honest.
He's now more interested in robotics.

23
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,291
-Ah, we'll take it.
-You don't wanna try it?

24
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,791
No, you're all right, love. We trust you.
Here. There you go.

25
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:12,750
Fifty.

26
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,500
Oh, the advert did say a hundred.

27
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:23,666
Um, I'll see what else. Oh… Ah! fiver, 55.

28
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,458
Hang on. Hey, what have you boys got?
Empty your pockets.

29
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,625
Fifty-five. Oh, 57!

30
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,208
Fifty-seven. Fifty… Come on, boys.

31
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,208
What have you got, boys?
Empty your pockets, guys.

32
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,166
Go on, then.

33
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,916
- Yay!
- Good on you, love.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,666
Just freeze, okay? It's not a toy.

35
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,416
So how do you get to live
in a place like this?

36
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,833
You rob a bloody bank, mate.

37
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,541
- Don't say that.
- What?

38
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:59,208
Behind every fortune there's a crime.

39
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,708
What? You never heard that?

40
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,833
Boys, you know your mother
would be living in a joint like this

41
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,666
if she wasn't a teenage runaway.

42
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,791
Ah, come on, darl.

43
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,250
We got a really good deal.

44
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,541
Fifty-seven bucks.
It's worth twice that much.

45
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,125
You all right, Mum?

46
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,833
It's gonna get better, Frankie.
Promise.

47
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:35,083
It's gonna get so good
you'll forget it was ever bad.

48
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:48,958

Epic. How'd it get up there?

00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,625

Societal breakdown.

72
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,625
You boys know Teddy.

73
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,625
Bit young to be starting work,
aren't they?

74
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,791
Oh, show and tell for their school,
you know?

75
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:00,458
What will you show them, one of the hands?
"Hey, teach, cop this."

76
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,416
"What the fuck?!"

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,208
I got one of 'em at home
for my dogs to chew on.

78
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,750
You know what you should do,
put some tomato sauce on it.

79
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:12,291
-Are you a machinist here too, then?
-No. I got a proper job driving a truck.

80
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,291
Right-o.

81
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,916
-How's Frankie goin'?
-Yeah, she's all right.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,875
Yeah? You bringin' her
to the party next month?

83
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,333
It's free feed.
You could even bring the kids if you want.

84
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,541
Hey, wanna talk to you about somethin'.

85
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,000
Listen up, mate. Now…

86
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,500
What are they talkin' about?

87
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,708
I'll still drive there?

88
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,625
- Easy. Fuckin' easy.
- Okay. See you.

89
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,041
All right. Come on.

90
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,000
You're so slow. Geez, Louise.

91
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,541
Yes!

92
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,250
Hey. Have a look.

93
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,000
Pretty snazzy, huh? Yeah?

94
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:52,916
Excellent.

95
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,000
- Hey, mate.
- Good day, Lyle.

96
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,416
Come look at my station.

97
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,458
Come on, Gus.

98
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,208
Hm?

99
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,666
What's wrong, mate?

100
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,916
Does it get boring?

101
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:09,791
No. No way, mate.
There's different stuff to do every day.

102
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,541
You got legs, you got arms, feet, knees.

103
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:14,958
It's great.

104
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,625
Hey, kids.

105
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,833
- I am your father.
- But not our real one.

106
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,166
Oi, oi, stop playing about.

107
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,583
G'day, boss.

108
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,500
Lyle.

109
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,416
So who have we here?

110
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,916
Ah, this is Eli and this is Gus.
My old lady's kids.

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,541
Boys. This is Mr. Broz.
He owns this whole factory.

112
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,791
Go on, shake hands.

113
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,375
Mm…

114
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,375
You have strength in you, boy.

115
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,750
Hm?

116
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,166
Yes? No?

117
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:05,750
He doesn't talk. Hasn't said a word
since he was eight years old.

118
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,083
- Is he, uh…
- No, nothing wrong with him at all.

119
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,000
He's sharp as a tack.

120
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,875
He knows all sorts of stuff,
he just doesn't say it.

121
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:12,916
Ah…

122
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,500
So you're the chatterbox
of the family, are you?

123
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,041
Give me your arm.

124
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,500
Don't be scared.

125
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,000
Ah, yes.

126
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,291
Not yet developed.

127
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,041
I can feel it in the marrow.

128
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,166
The bone is hard, but not yet full.

129
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,833
So what interesting things
does your brother know?

130
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,333
Actually, he can tell the future.

131
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:47,125
Our own regular Hegesistratus, hmm?

132
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:50,625
Who?

133
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:54,125
He was an ancient Greek prophet
who cut off his own foot

134
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,166
because he no longer wanted
to remain in captivity.

135
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,250
So, give me an example
of your brother's soothsaying.

136
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:07,333
Well, there was this one time
where he wrote "Park Terrace,"

137
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,208
and that was the day that Mum sees

138
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,416
this old lady stepping off the footpath
with her shopping.

139
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,458
Then Mum pulls her back

140
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,833
just as a council bus
is about to flatten her.

141
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,041
Ah. On Park Terrace?

142
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,625
No. Oxley Avenue.

143
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,291
But then Mum took the old lady home.

144
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,125
To Park Terrace.

145
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,416
No, actually she lived
on something Boulevard.

146
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,125
But it was a block of flats,

147
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,458
with a sign saying
to please park on the terrace.

148
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,083
Spooky, eh?

149
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,708
- Interesting kids you have, Lyle.
- Yes, boss. Thank you, boss.

150
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,291
Mm.

151
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,500
Dear Alex,
it's the last two weeks of term

152
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,666
and school's startin' to feel
even more pointless than usual.

153
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,208
Mum's doing something artsy crafty
for the end-of-year fete,

154
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,208
but those skills
are never gonna make us rich.

155
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,166
I reckon Gus could really clean up
as a professional fortune-teller,

156
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,750
but until he breaks his silence,

157
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,375
I'll have to explore
other sources of income.

158
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,875
Bich Dang is the richest person we know
and she did sort of offer me a job.

159
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,291
Anyway, Lyle's got an invite
to some centenary

160
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,500
for the limbs factory where he works
with all those other ex-crims,

161
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,541
and Mum's all "ooh-la-la" about it.

162
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,458
I think it's just gonna be
everyone tryin' to be respectable

163
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,208
when none of us are.

164
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:53,583
Dear Eli, it's been a slow couple
of weeks in here also.

165
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,083
The only amusement being
Billy Pedan gettin' dunked into shit

166
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,208
for knifin' Giggsy.

167
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,375
Surprise, cunt!

168
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,041
Now they've put a rim
on all the shit buckets

169
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,666
so they're too small
to fit a human head inside.

170
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,166
All I'd say is beware of shortcuts.

171
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,375
There's no such thing as easy money,

172
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:16,791
and retribution does come to all of us,
usually when you least expect it.

173
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,083
Lyle, where are ya?

174
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,791
Ha-ha. This looks fun. Can I have a go?

175
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,750
It's gonna be a stall at the fete.
Hang on. You have to stand behind this.

176
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,000
-You stick that down with superglue?
-You have to pump harder.

177
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,333
Do you say that to all the blokes,
do you? Hey?

178
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,083
Right, watch this.

179
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,916
Ah-ha! Got him!

180
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,708
-So what's the prize you're offering?
-Just lollies and stuff.

181
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,791
Mm.

182
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,083
Hey, uh, could you tell the boys
I'm parked out front please? Thank you.

183
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,625
Come on, mate. You got your floaties.

184
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,375
Hello.

185
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,958
Read the bloody sign.

186
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,541
What's goin' on?

187
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,583
- Pool's closed for maintenance.
- You're fuckin' kidding me.

188
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:35,625
What needs to be repaired in a pool?
Fuckin' hole with water in it.

189
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,583
I dunno, chemicals or something?
Sorry, boys. You'll have to walk home.

190
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,291
Supposed to be at Jamboree Heights
five minutes ago. Go on, scram.

191
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,541
-Wait. What's at Jamboree Heights?
-None of your business. Now, go on.

192
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,166
-You selling that gear from Bich Dang?
-Hey!

193
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,125
I bloody warned you.

194
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,375
Shit, what? I know, Gus knows,
I bet Mum probably knows too.

195
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,916
Also, Gus's thongs are broken.

196
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,250
Oh, look at that.
That's bloody convenient, isn't it?

197
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,375
Get in.

198
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,625
Hey, with the kids?

199
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,708
Yeah, yeah, they'll be fine. Go on.

200
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,583
Bastards.

201
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,500
Don't touch anything.

202
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,958
So, this is the place?

203
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,541
- So, what are we waiting for?
- Mate, just put a sock in it, please?

204
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,458
Okay, you two just sit here
and stay outta sight, okay?

205
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,625
Okay, all right.

206
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,416
So when that bloke over there
asks what we're doing, I'll be like,

207
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,708
"It's all right, sir."

208
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:10,375
-"My stepdad's just making a drug deal."
-Shh! You're startin' to piss me off.

209
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,666
All right. Come on.

210
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,833
What the fuck?

211
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:23,333
They won't say a word.
Don't say a fucking word!

212
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,416
- Yeah.
- I'm serious.

213
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,125
That you, bro?

214
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,458
It's open.

215
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,166
Sit down, bro.

216
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:18,666
Oh, um…

217
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,041
No. Sit down, bro.

218
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,000
That's some prize parenting there,
brother.

219
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:40,333
Bringing your kids to a drug delivery.
Papa of the year, hey, cuz?

220
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,000
Well, the pool was gettin' repaired.

221
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:47,833
-What needs to be repaired at a pool?
-I know. That's what I said.

222
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,166
So what's the film about?

223
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:02,833
Dunno, boy.

224
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,583
Gangsters and shit.

225
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,500
Right now he's traveling around Hong Kong,

226
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,208
trying to find a fucker
who cut off his old lady's head.

227
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,458
-What did he cut off her head for?
-Because he's a fucker.

228
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:17,416
Like your mate Ivan, eh?
It's what evil fuckers do.

229
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,500
- So you got something for me?
- Yeah.

230
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,666
Brought you some beers.

231
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,875
-Do you wanna check it?
-You check it.

232
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:40,958
Come on, Elsie!

233
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,041
Can't you see
it's gettin' to the best bit?

234
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,000
You boys wanna come in
and choose a soft drink?

235
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:05,416
There's some Iced VoVo biscuits in there,
next to the sweet potatoes.

236
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
You want a beer, bro?

237
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,250
- Yeah.
- Give it here.

238
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:34,916
What's that?

239
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,125
It's a mere.

240
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,916
It's my family heirloom.

241
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,333
Belonged to
my great-great-great-grandfather.

242
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,041
-What's it do?
-It's a lethal weapon.

243
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,500
If you know how to swing it,
that thing can do real damage.

244
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:55,583
It can bust the top of a Pakeha's skull
like cracking the top off an egg.

245
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,250
- What's a Pakeha?
- It's a white fellow.

246
00:16:58,875 --> 00:16:59,750
Like Lyle.

247
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,541
That's some good stuff, I'll tell ya.

248
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,458
Better than that Dustin Vang shit.

249
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,708
Who's Dustin Vang?

250
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,833
You ask a lot of questions,
don't you?

251
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,875
Dustin Vang
is a dealer outta Sydney.

252
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,916
But he cuts his gear with Mannitol
so we don't like to use him.

253
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,416
And his couriers keep getting bumped off.

254
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,708
Who bumps them off?

255
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,041
You'd have to ask Lyle that.

256
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,250
You gonna drink that?

257
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,541
Or just gonna stand there
and stare at my tits all afternoon?

258
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,458
Sorry.

259
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,625
So, Captain Details, what were you
and Elsie talking about in the kitchen?

260
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,958
Well, she had this big Maori club

261
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:14,125
hanging on the wall, which belonged
to her great-great-grandfather,

262
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:17,000
-who's like the Viv Richards of warriors.
-Aha.

263
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,500
And also she said our gear
was heaps better than Dustin Vang's,

264
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,541
'cause he cuts his gear with Mannitol.

265
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,041
Right.

266
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,708
What's Mannitol?

267
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,416
Okay, let it go, mate.

268
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:58,791
Hey, I'm drivin' the truck next weekend
so someone else will need to ride shotgun.

269
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:04,958
- All right.
- Sorry.

270
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,125
There you go.

271
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,166
It's done for now.

272
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,541
Unreal. Thank you.

273
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:17,541
See ya.

274
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,250
I could ride shotgun.

275
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,250
Good one, buddy.

276
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,166
The other thing Elsie said

277
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,750
is that someone keeps
bumping off Dustin Vang's delivery guys.

278
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,291
Is that what Ivan Kroll does?

279
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,958
Huh. There's no such person, okay?

280
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:39,291
Ivan Kroll is a bogeyman invented
to keep everyone in line. That's all.

281
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,625
Yeah, well, Darren believes in him,
and so did Ezra.

282
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:42,833
Ah, do they now?

283
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,833
Either way, you could use someone
to watch your back.

284
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,333
You know what I could use?
Someone who talks a little less.

285
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,458
All right? I mean, Jesus, mate,

286
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,375
if you wanna help,
just pull your head in a bit, okay?

287
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,583
You know? Have a bar.

288
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:03,083
I don't need someone to ride shotgun.
I don't need that. I don't need it.

289
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,250
Jeez, where does he get
these bloody ideas from?

290
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,625
Mum!

291
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,958
Oi. I don't want you hanging out
with Nunchucks anymore, okay?

292
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,583
He's a full-on bloody psycho.

293
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,125
What do you mean?
I don't hang out with Darren.

294
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,125
You seemed pretty tight with him
the other night.

295
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:16,916
-You seemed pretty tight with his mum.
-Oi! That's business.

296
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,625
You boys! Get to your classes now.

297
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,083
Go on, get outta here.
Bugger off, both of youse. Go on.

298
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,416
Thanks for the lift.

299
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,541
You're welcome.

300
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,250
See you, Gussie.

301
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,666
Hoo-hoo!

302
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,250
Hoo-hoo!

303
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,208
Hoo-hoo!

304
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,208
Hoo-hoo!

305
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,000
Better get going. See you, Gus.

306
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,333
Oh no!

307
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,208
-Oh my God.
-What happened?

308
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:35,875
- Is she okay?
- Uh…

309
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,333
Shelly, are you all right?

310
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,125
Just sit and get your breath back.

311
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,333
You just breathe.

312
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,083
Thank you.

313
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,166
Next.

314
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,125
Uh, Mum? What are you doing here?

315
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,666
Shelly Huffman's mum took her
to the doctor, so I volunteered.

316
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,791
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You're 13.

317
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:08,291
Eli, I don't have to ask your permission
to work at the school canteen.

318
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,125
-Jesus, Mum.
-So what do you want?

319
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,500
Um, can I get three lamingtons?

320
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:13,625
That's not a lunch.

321
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:17,708
-Mum!
-All right. All right. Three lamingtons.

322
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:24,791
Have a good day.

323
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:27,583
Thank you.

324
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,208
Kids, eh?

325
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,458
Uh, so Lyle's busy?

326
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,375
Yeah, he's still working at the factory.

327
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,458
Mm.

328
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,250
He, uh… He couldn't get us
a bit of blow, could he?

329
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:42,750
No.

330
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,666
Lyle doesn't do that anymore.

331
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,166
Sorry, I heard he'd--

332
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,291
-Heard what?
-Sorry.

333
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,875
I heard you're doing a stall at the fete.

334
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,416
Just doing our bit for the community.

335
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Mm-hmm.

336
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:03,458
Next.

337
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:12,291
Lyle teach him that left hook?
Could be a good career in that.

338
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,416
Do you think Gus will ever speak again?

339
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:18,875
Don't see why not.

340
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,583
Do you think
he can really tell the future?

341
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,166
You know…

342
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,541
…if I could tell the future,

343
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:31,125
I'd be keepin' quiet about it.

344
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:33,208
Why?

345
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:36,625
Because people wouldn't leave you alone.
What'll you tell them?

346
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,166
Sometimes bad things have to happen
to get good things.

347
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:40,916
Like what?

348
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,166
Well, if your Mum
hadn't run away from home,

349
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,666
she wouldn't have met Robert.

350
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,166
If Robert wasn't a hopeless drunk,
she wouldn't have met Lyle.

351
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,291
That's a lot of bad things
for one good thing.

352
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,250
Two good things.

353
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,208
Got to meet you two little bastards.

354
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:57,333
What I'm saying is,

355
00:24:57,416 --> 00:25:01,125
you know, pain and pleasure, they're…
they're just all part of being human.

356
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:05,541
That's how you know you're born.
If it doesn't hurt, not real life, mate.

357
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:12,958
So Teddy hasn't been with you
for a couple of weeks.

358
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:13,958
Jesus, mate.

359
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:18,250
Well, I reckon you want me along
'cause I see stuff you don't.

360
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,708
Just stay in the car
for this one, mate, okay?

361
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:23,500
These blokes are bloody hardcore.
I mean it.

362
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,916
No need to count it.

363
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,125
It's all there.

364
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:52,166
Now you promise me this is the good stuff.

365
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:54,541
It's always the good stuff, mate.

366
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,125
Mm. 'Cause last time was a little bit off.

367
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,666
Maybe your body's getting used to it.

368
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,750
-And maybe you're just tryin' to fuck us!
-Jeez. Relax, okay.

369
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:14,208
Lyle, what's happening?

370
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:15,541
Who the fuck are you?

371
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,041
I thought I told you
to stay in the bloody car, mate.

372
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:26,000
-What are you starin' at?
-He's not starin' at anything, mate.

373
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,250
Well, to be honest, I was just wondering

374
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:33,791
if you were going bald
before you became a skinhead

375
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,541
or if that happened afterwards.

376
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,375
The fuck you bring your kid for, eh?

377
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:52,125

- I heard you were in hospital.

00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:38,041
What are these for?

407
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:40,291
Something wrong
with my leg muscles, apparently.

408
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,500
Shit. What's the treatment?

Nah, better get home,
cheer up my mum. See ya.

412
00:28:58,208 --> 00:29:00,375
-Mm. See you, then.
-See ya.

413
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,916
Eli, can you put the giblets
in the bin, please?

414
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,166
Eli, it's starting.

415
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,750
- Tell Lyle he'll miss the start.
- Okay.

416
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:56,833
- Don't cheat.
- I'm not.

417
00:29:56,916 --> 00:29:57,916
Uh-huh.

418
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:01,666
- Okay. What is it?
- Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

419
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,916
Go on.

420
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:09,250
No.

421
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:11,541
Are you sure we can afford this?

422
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,291
Worth every bloody penny, honey.

423
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:16,125
-Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
-Ah.

424
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:19,166
I love you.

425
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:22,791
The match is starting.

426
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:30,750
Hello and welcome
to viewers right round Australia

427
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,583
for the 1985 preliminary final

428
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:35,625
between the Canberra Bulldogs
and the Paramatta Eels.

429
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,791
-Can I ask you something?
-You already did.

430
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:43,333
Supposing you were doing something
that you might get caught for,

431
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:45,875
and if you get caught,
you'll be in deep shit,

432
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:49,666
but the only people you were robbing
were villains anyway,

433
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,708
would you do it?

434
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:55,083
-Is this about you or asking for a friend?
-Asking for a friend.

435
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:59,125
I'd tell your friend that someone's
always gotta pay the price.

436
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:02,208
You might get away with it for a while,
but in the long run,

437
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,958
it'll come back to bite you on the bum.

438
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:06,041
If not you, someone you love.

439
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:08,166
Just the way the world works.

440
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,250
Oi.

441
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,583
You look how happy your mum is.

442
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:17,416
Why would you want anyone to risk that?

443
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,625
All right, boys.

444
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:25,041
-Here we go.
-Goody.

445
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:27,125
There you go, mate.

446
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,083
Thanks, mate.

447
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:30,500
…underground,
and indeed, around the country,

448
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:31,875
to rise for the national…

449
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:33,208
Scooch over, mate.

450
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:38,625
Can you tell Lyle what you just told me?

451
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:40,458
Hey, not now, mate, come on.

452
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:43,208

Why aren't they cooked already?

00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:18,166
Take those flowers to the bar.

462
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:21,041
Where are the table cloths?

Quick, the guests will be here soon.

465
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:29,125
Boys, get a wriggle on.
I don't wanna be late.

466
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:30,500
How do I look?

467
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,958
Like a bloody goddess.

468
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:44,625
Twirl there.

469
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:48,458
Wow.

470
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:52,833
I'll get the kids.

471
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:53,750
Okay.

472
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:56,416
I'll, um…

473
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,500
I'll warm up the Datsun.

474
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,416
Hm.

475
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,083
Do you want a hand?

476
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:06,541
Come on.

477
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,291
Can't me and Gus just stay home
and watch a video?

478
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:15,500
It'll be fun.

479
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:18,291
It'll just be a bunch of old people
making speeches.

480
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:21,958
Well, you might meet someone useful
like Tytus Broz.

481
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,500
We met him already. He's creepy.

482
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:26,166
I know you just turned 13,
but it's not compulsory

483
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,708
to be shitty about everything.

484
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:29,875
That's not what being a teenager's about.

485
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,416
Lyle's been at the factory
for three years.

486
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,041
He's a valued employee.

487
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:37,541
Mum, if they valued him,
they would've given him a promotion or--

488
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,166
Stop it, Eli.

489
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:41,708
We're going, you're coming.

490
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:43,875
You can at least look
like you're enjoying yourself.

491
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,625
You're trying to make us look respectable.

492
00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:49,458
Respectable is why Lyle pulls on his
overalls every day and goes to work,

493
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:51,416
even when he doesn't feel like it.

494
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,041
Respectable is why
he fixes the fly screens,

495
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:55,500
and cuts the grass,

496
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:58,083
and puts money in the bank
to get us out of here.

497
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:01,250
Respectable is why you have food
and loo paper,

498
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,375
and your day isn't always going to shit.

499
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:08,541
So don't knock respectable, right?
It's got a lot going for it.

500
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:26,500
- See now, you look sharp.
- Hey, okay.

501
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,000

Hi, Darren.

507
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:05,750
Tink? How the fuck
did you score an invite?

508
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,791
I dunno. Lyle works there.

509
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:14,083
- So, how's the distribution business?
- Pretty good, I think.

510
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:16,750
I go on the deliveries with him sometimes.

511
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:18,000
And do what?

512
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:21,625
Keep look-out.
Make sure no one's takin' advantage.

513
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:24,583
Tink, the standover man?

514
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:31,916
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

515
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:34,250
Dinner is served.

516
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:41,791
Here we go.

517
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,583
So who's at your table?

518
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:46,500
The local member for Oxley.

519
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:49,000
And that's Detective Tim Cotton.

520
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:52,666
'Cause Tytus helps
prisoners in rehab, right?

521
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,541
No,
it's 'cause half the cops around here

522
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:57,750
get their Christmas holidays
funded by Mum.

523
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:15,791
That's Ivan Kroll.

524
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:19,166
Lyle said there was no such person.

525
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,333
Lyle probably wishes there wasn't.

526
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:28,875
What happened to his face?

527
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:34,375
Well, the story is the brother
of one of his victims

528
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,208
came after him with a shotgun.

529
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:45,500
Atlas Prosthetics made him
that face thing.

530
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,958
So what happened to the guy
who shot him in the face?

531
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:55,208
Took him a while
to find the bloke,

532
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:59,041
but finally, he tracked him down
to a logging camp in bumfuck Tasmania.

533
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:20,708
Eli! Lookin' sharp, buddy.

534
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:23,875
Hey, uh,
what table are the folks at?

535
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,166
Feel good, Gussie?

536
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,750
Um…

537
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,833
It's Teddy. You know him?

538
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:35,166
Think he fancies my mum.

539
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,916
Oh!

540
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,208
Everyone fancies your mum, Tink.
I'd give her one.

541
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:45,208
Ladies and gentlemen,

542
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:51,125
please give the warmest welcome
to your host tonight, Mr. Tytus Broz.

543
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,125
Thank you.

544
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:06,166
As some of you know,

545
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:10,166
the three most important women in my life

546
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:12,958
are my mother,

547
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,333
my daughter,

548
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,916
and my beloved wife.

549
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:20,750
All sadly dead now.

550
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:28,125
My daughter Hannah
was the brightest light in my life.

551
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:35,125
Despite all the challenges that she faced
from her rare, disabling condition,

552
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:38,875
from the minute
that I held her in my arms,

553
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:43,666
I knew my purpose on this Earth.

554
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,541
To give mobility.

555
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:52,416
To give independence.

556
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:58,500
To give dignity to my daughter

557
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:01,791
and all those like her in the world.

558
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:06,083
But we have a long way to go, my friends.

559
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:10,583
It is my hope and belief

560
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:14,000
that fully-functioning arms and legs

561
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:19,000
will be as replaceable
as automobile parts.

562
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:21,208
Till then,

563
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:25,333
I promise you that our sacred mission

564
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:31,625
to restore full mobility
to all those who desire it

565
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:33,750
and deserve it…

566
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:39,541
has only just begun.

567
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,125

Hey, can I have a balloon?

596
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:16,916
So close. You got it. You got it.

597
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:21,250
Yes! Yes! Yes! I hit it.

598
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:25,125
Yeah, you did, man. Congratulations.

599
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:27,166
- Thank you.
- Well done.

600
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,416
- Mutant Madness. Step right up.
- Whoo!

601
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:35,041
Can you put all the money
in the bag, Frances,

602
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,083
and make sure it's all correct?

603
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:38,833
'Course.

604
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:44,416
Popstick Pandemonium!
Pick a stick and win a prize!

605
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:47,208
Anybody?

606
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:49,958
This is a pretty lame stall.
Did you volunteer for it?

607
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:53,208
No, Mum said we had to.
Yeah, she's gone all community on us.

608
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:58,791
I like your mum. I always used
to be jealous of your family.

609
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:01,083
Jealous of us. Why?

610
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,500
Because you're loved.

611
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:06,250
Everyone's loved, aren't they?

612
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:10,666
I mean, I feel loved,
but now I'm just making my mum really sad.

613
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:14,416
You're luckier
than you think you are, Bell.

614
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:45,083
Yeah. Come on, mate!

615
00:42:48,791 --> 00:42:50,333
Popstick Pandemonium!

616
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:51,833
Mutant Madness!

617
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:54,416
Popstick Pandemonium!

618
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,291
No, no, no. Mutant Madness!

619
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:59,416
A whole lotta popsticks
and a whole lotta pandemonium.

620
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,791
No. Mutant Madness.

621
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:03,666
Mutant Madness, there are no real mutants.
Just saying.

622
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:07,750
Better prizes over here.
Way better prizes over here.

623
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,958
We want food! We want food! We want food!

624
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:14,708
Hey!

625
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,250
Look at that, would ya? Hey?

626
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,333
-What was that for?
-Nothing.

627
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:24,541
Hm.

628
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:26,041
I really enjoyed today.

629
00:43:26,833 --> 00:43:28,958
It just felt really wholesome.

630
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:31,458
You know what I mean?
Everyone together as a family.

631
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:33,166
I know exactly what you mean, darl.

632
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,666
You guys just wait.

633
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:38,208
Very soon it's all gonna get
even more rosy, I promise.

634
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:40,541
Maybe.

635
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,583
-Give that a minute.
-Oh, come on.

636
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:47,083
Spag bol, you little champion!

637
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,458
Mate, you could've
at least shut the bloody door.

638
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:50,958
You wanna let that breathe.

639
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:56,625
-I'll get it.
-Did you boys invite Shelly or something?

640
00:43:56,708 --> 00:43:58,625
Ooh, Shelly!

641
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:01,708
Sorry to interrupt.

642
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,666
- Who are you?
- Friend of Lyle's.

643
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:14,500
You, out.

644
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:19,583
- Go on, get out!
- All right. All right.

645
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:22,583
You, sit.

646
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:25,791
Don't move. This won't take long.

647
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,916
Just need to ask Lyle
about his little side business.

648
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:34,500
Side business?
What's he talking about, Lyle?

649
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,666
- I don't know what he's talking--
- Shut up!

650
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:38,083
Fuckin'…

651
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:41,750
Wanna tell us
where you hid the extra, Lyle?

652
00:44:54,041 --> 00:44:55,000
Hey! Hey!

653
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:57,458
Come on now,
there's no need for this shit.

654
00:44:57,541 --> 00:44:59,208
Where'd you hide the extra, Lyle?

655
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:00,625
It's okay.

656
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:02,625
It's okay.

657
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:07,083
- Okay.
- So?

658
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:10,333
Gussie.

659
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:18,750
What are you doin'? What's he telling him?

660
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:21,000
Cut that shit out. Talk to me, Lyle.

661
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,666
Fuck! Stop.

662
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:36,625
Eli.

663
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:48,500
I'm sorry, Frankie.

664
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:51,416
No, Lyle. No, Lyle. Lyle.

665
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,166
Oh, fuck this. Get him outta here.

666
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,666
Lyle! No!

667
00:45:57,416 --> 00:46:00,583
I'm sorry, baby. I was just tryin'
to make it better for everyone.

668
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:01,791
Lyle! Lyle!

669
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:03,250
They don't know nothing!

670
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:05,875
Mum!

671
00:46:05,958 --> 00:46:10,458
Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum!

672
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:13,875
- Sit down.
- Mum! Mum!

673
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:15,458
Shut the fuck up, kid.

674
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:17,666
Breathe.

675
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:20,458
Breathe.

676
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:26,250
Now, I don't have much time.
And this is your last chance

677
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:29,625
to stop something
very unpleasant from happening.

678
00:46:37,416 --> 00:46:40,125
-What did Lyle say to you?
-He doesn't talk!

679
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:43,541
Everyone talks eventually.

680
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:45,125
Ow!

681
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:47,875
What did he say, dummy?

682
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:50,125
Where did Lyle hide the extra?

683
00:46:51,666 --> 00:46:53,250
Write it in the air for me.

684
00:46:54,791 --> 00:46:56,541
Write what Lyle said,

685
00:46:57,166 --> 00:46:59,791
and I won't cut off
your little brother's finger.

686
00:46:59,875 --> 00:47:02,583
No! He doesn't know anything.

687
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:05,000
There's a good kid. Spell it out for him.

688
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:08,958
Tell him.

689
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:11,916
- Spit it out, Gus.
- He doesn't--

690
00:47:18,166 --> 00:47:19,041
He said…

691
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:27,000
"Whatever happens…

692
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:31,250
I love you boys very much."

693
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:40,041
Yeah, yeah. And what else?

694
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:41,958
The rest was kind of,

695
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:45,083
"Go tell the sack of shit
to go fuck himself."

696
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:47,083
And stuff.

697
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:51,958
That's hilarious.
