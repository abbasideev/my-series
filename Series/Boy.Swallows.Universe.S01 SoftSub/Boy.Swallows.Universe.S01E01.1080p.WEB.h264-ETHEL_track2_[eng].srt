00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,625
This is your last chance

2
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,958
to stop something very unpleasant
from happening.

3
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,958
Wanna tell us
where you hid the extra, Lyle?

4
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,083
Eli, I'm sorry, mate.

5
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,458
Talk to me, Lyle!

6
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,625
I'm sorry, Frankie.

7
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,916
Get him outta here.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,250
Lyle! Lyle! Lyle! Lyle!

9
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,333
Little shit.

10
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:52,916
No, no, no! Stop hitting me!

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,958
- Call the police, somebody!
- Come on!

12
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,666
Somebody call the cops!

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,583
Don't put me in the fucking trunk!

14
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,208
-Shut up!
-Put me in the back seat!

15
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,708
Get in! Shit.

16
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,500
I love you, Frankie!

17
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:04,666
Shut up!

18
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,541
No, no, no, no…

19
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:31,750
Don't fuck with Ivan Kroll,
ya fuckin' idiot.

20
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,708
What the fuck?

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ah…

22
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,000
Hm?

23
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,291
Oh.

24
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:51,750
Oh!

25
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:53,666
Fuck off!

26
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,291
Fuckin'…

27
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,333
Wait!

28
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:18,291
You know, life is really different
when you grow up in a family of outlaws.

29
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,333
Uh…

30
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,958
But even in a town like Darra,

31
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:31,583
you still have school,
homework, and doing what grown-ups say.

32
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,166
Although I reckon grown-ups
can get confused,

33
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,000
to make the kind of bad decisions
that land them in jail.

34
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,625
Boys, wake up.

35
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,625
Slim'll be here soon.

36
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,125
Wake up.

♪ Tell those friends

38
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:50,458

avoid making those mistakes again,

39
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,375
and stay on the straight and narrow.

40
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,875
-Mum, mum! Guess what!
-What?

41
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,375
Slim's gonna let me go down
the main road this time.

42
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,250
Well, I trust you.

43
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,583
And he reckons
I'm a much better driver than Lyle.

44
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,625
Wow.

45
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:09,666
What you makin'?

46
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,041
You know, I'm not entirely sure yet.

47
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,250
Maybe ask me later.

48
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:15,875
Looks good though.

49
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:17,750
Thanks.

50
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,541
Our mum really is
the best in the world.

51
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,541
She's always tryin' to do
what's best for me and my brother Gus,

52
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,583
and we're tryin' to get the best for her.

53
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,125
Her only fault is being
too trusting of people,

54
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,125
but I'm not sure that's a fault.

You all right? What's Gus writin'?

A lot of what my brother writes
comes true eventually.

66
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,958
He's probably the smartest person
in the whole of Australia.

67
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,500
But he hasn't actually spoken
since he was seven years old.

I dunno. None of it makes sense
till after it's happened.

71
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,541
Okay, let's get goin'.

72
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,708
Remember what I told ya.
Clutch in, ignition on.

73
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,625
Okay. Okay. Up into first.

74
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,583
And then stead'ly on the peddly.

75
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,041
Like that.

76
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,375
Hey, come on.

77
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,416
-Let's get on the road.
-Hey!

78
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:54,791
-You’re doing well, eh.
-Oh!

79
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,166
That's it, hold it.

80
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,916
Jesus Christ!

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,833
Whoa.

82
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,750
Yep. Now you're drivin'.

83
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,125
So I started writing
to Alex Bermuda.

84
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,041
Like you said,

85
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,875
he's only got four more years
in prison if he keeps out of trouble.

86
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,541
Yeah, well, that's a big "if."

87
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,333
Is it really boring in prison?

88
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,166
'Cause I was wondering
how you lasted 25 years.

89
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,833
Learn to fucking drive!

90
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,833
One thing you learn is how to master time.

91
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,000
Slow it all down
by focusing on the details

92
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,541
or you can speed it up by being so busy,
not enough hours in the day.

93
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,541
Busy with what?

94
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,791
Collecting cockroach shit,
so you can sign your name with it.

95
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,000
Make your bed,
read some chapters of your book,

96
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,916
play yourself at chess,
then play the winner.

97
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,458
Go fishin' in your mind,
down off Redcliffe Jetty.

98
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,208
Catch a big bloody flathead, cook it,

99
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,625
watch the sun go down.

100
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,916
-Brake.
-Do what?

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Brake!

102
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,416
Now you know what "give way" means.

103
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay. Gear stick into neutral.

104
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:03,875
Ignition on.

105
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,916
Stead'ly on the peddly.

106
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,666
According to Slim,

107
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,541
staying on the right side of the law
is just like driving.

108
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,333
"Stead'ly on the peddly."

109
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,083
Lyle!

110
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,166
Lyle, did you see me driving?

111
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,000
I was full-on driving!

112
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,750
Yeah, mate. Hey. You'll make
a bloody good driver one day, you will.

113
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,375
- Better driver than you, mate.
- Right-o, Slim.

114
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,625
Cheers.

115
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,083
Hey, mate, what you got on tonight?

116
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,958
Frankie, she's doing her Jane Fonda class,

117
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,833
and I got a few things
I gotta take care of.

118
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,500
Wondering if you could, uh,
keep an eye on the rugrats.

119
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,375
Make sure they do
their homework, you know?

120
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,291
Yeah, anytime.

121
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,458
Good on you, mate.

122
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,875
Hey, bugalugs.

123
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,083
Did you thank him?

124
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,833
- Oh! Cheers, Slim!
- Yeah, bit bloody late now.

125
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,875
Mum, I drove all the way down
to the cement factory.

126
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,500
And I learned to give way.

127
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,250
Hey, slow down.

128
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,958
Wipe your feet. Stop running.

129
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,833
Closer to home,
the Brisbane drug wars take a grisly turn.

130
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:12,666
Caitlyn Spies from the Courier Mail
has been following the story.

131
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,583
All we know so far is that the body
of an unidentified man was found…

132
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,291
Ah, Eli, turn that off.

133
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,375
…on a patch of waste ground
near Stapleton,

134
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,083
missing his right arm.

135
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,000
Police have linked the killing
to the ongoing conflict

136
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,000
between rival Asian drug gangs,

137
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:31,333
and are asking anyone with any information
to please come forward.

138
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,083
- Mum!
- It's just the news, Eli.

139
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,958
That was Caitlyn Spies.

140
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,083
I don't care if it was Mikhail Gorbachev.
Do your homework.

141
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,208
Oh, shut up.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,791
Boys, stop!

143
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,958
Eli, stop!

144
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,958
Lyle and I are going out later.
Slim's babysitting.

145
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,250
Out where?

146
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,416
To the cinema.

147
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,541
Hey, Slim, you're in the paper.

148
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:37,833
Yeah, I saw that.

149
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:41,291
- Is that the guy who put you away?
- Corrupt psycho that he was.

150
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:46,125
So, did you actually kill
that taxi driver, or didn't you?

151
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,250
What do you think?

152
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,708
I dunno.
I don't think you're a violent person.

153
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,625
Never underestimate
what any man is capable of.

154
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,791
So do you think Lyle's gone back
to dealing smack?

155
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,333
I dunno. Why don't you ask him?

156
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,833
I didn't wanna put him on the spot.

157
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,916
He's doing his best, I suppose.

158
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,791
You're a good kid.

159
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,291
You reckon?

160
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,458
You just, you know, keep your nose clean,
stay out of trouble.

161
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,791
And you let Lyle deal with his own shit.

162
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,833
Dear Alex.

163
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,625
There's a lot that goes unsaid
in our kind of family,

164
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,250
either from trying to protect each other

165
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,500
or just normal
head-in-the-sand kind of stuff.

166
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,166
I'd be interested to see where you stand

167
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,708
between saying too much
or saying too little.

168
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,458
Strikes me that both can end really badly.

169
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,125
Dear Eli, greetings
from your pal Alex Bermuda

170
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,750
and the boys in B16.

171
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,958
Still can't get over
you knowing Slim Halliday.

172
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,250
What a legend that man is.

173
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,583
In regards to getting involved
in things outside of your control,

174
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,291
I've had a fair while
to consider this myself.

175
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:11,125
We're all social beings, it's natural
to wanna pitch in for your mates.

176
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,833
But then, a lot of bad decisions are made
emotionally in the heat of the moment.

177
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:20,375
Case in point, the screws took our TV
the other day for some minor misdemeanor,

178
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,291
and the result was pretty untidy.

179
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,125
Like sands in the hourglass,

180
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,250
so are the days of our lives.

181
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,625
You can take a con's freedom,

182
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,708
take his rights, take his humanity,

183
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,458
but for God's sake,

184
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,916
don't take his Days of Our Lives.

185
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:55,583
♪ Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday ♪

186
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,875
Shh…

187
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,250
Oh…

188
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,958
I have to check on the kids.

189
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,458
They're fine. Shh.

190
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,791
So, what was the movie?

191
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,416
The one you were at last night.

192
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,708
Oh yeah, it was good.

193
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,375
Terms of Endearment.

194
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,083
So, what's it about?

195
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,041
It's a love story.

196
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:51,500
-Does it have a happy ending?
-Mm, happy and sad.

197
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,333
Eat your breakfast.

198
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:57,250
Hey, so my boss says it's all right
to bring your kids to work, you know,

199
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,333
for the show and tell at school.
Good news, eh?

200
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,208
Only problem is we're not your kids.

201
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,416
Yeah, well, it's also "bring an annoying
little squirt to work" day,

202
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,250
so I reckon you both qualify. Hm…

203
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,791
So, what did you think
of the film last night?

204
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,333
Oh…

205
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,958
-What'd we--
-Terms of Endearment.

206
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:20,958
Terms of Endearment.

207
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,166
Yeah, it was a real good one.

208
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,166
Real chick flick.

209
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,875
-Mm-hmm.
-Ask your mum about it.

210
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,166
- Hey?
- Mm-hmm?

211
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,125
Where's my bloody, um-- Oh, thank you.

212
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:33,958
And me--

213
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,791
You're the best. Mwah!

214
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,833
All right, I'm offski.
Have a good day at school, boys.

215
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,083
You do know
that's not physically possible, right?

216
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,541
Yeah, well, that is why
it's the best preparation for life, mate.

217
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,333
Do you think he's dealing again?

218
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,416
'Cause I think he's dealing again.

219
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,875
Yeah, well, not if she ends up
on smack again.

220
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,250
Wanna take the shortcut?

221
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,291
Rack off, Astro Boy! This is our spot.

222
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,000
Come on, Gus. Just leave it.

223
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,208
Yeah, go on, then.

224
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,625
Gus, is it? We haven't met before.

225
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,750
I'm Poppy Birkbeck,
the guidance counselor. Take a seat.

226
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,750
I have to say,

227
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,958
you've certainly given my predecessors
plenty to think about.

228
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,541
I mean, everyone's agreed,
there's nothing wrong with you physically.

229
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,916
Hearing's perfect,

230
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,000
and obviously nothing wrong
with your brain,

231
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,750
judging by your academic record.

232
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:46,166
So… it's just
the speaking we have a problem with.

233
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,208
Wonder if your artworks tell us something.

234
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,250
This was your still life.

235
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,916
And this was your still life with flowers.

236
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,958
And a lot of these pictures have

237
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,375
this car in there.

238
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,083
Family group, Last Wave.

239
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,541
Those kids in the back.

240
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,250
Is that you and your brother?

241
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,541
Heading where?

242
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,958
If you can't say it, write it.

243
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,250
Or… draw it.

244
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,833
I know
it may seem pointless, Gus,

245
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,875
but I believe you and your brother
have enormous potential,

246
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,916
were it not for some past trauma.

247
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:50,541
It could be your mother's addiction,
her leaving your father,

248
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,250
or something else
you've decided to keep quiet about,

249
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,333
in belief that silence will protect you.

250
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,833
Or someone.

251
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,458
And I'm here to say
that silence rarely does that.

252
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,833
Usually makes it worse.

253
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,458
Draw me what you're hiding, Gus.

254
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:26,916
Hey, Tinker Bell.

255
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,166
Darren wants you
at the back of the science lab.

256
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,375
Everything all right, Gus?

257
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,916
Hey. What's happening?

258
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,250
Hold out your hands and close your eyes.

259
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,375
He said hold out your hands.
You brain-damaged or something?

260
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,750
Oh, fuckin' hell!

261
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,583
- I need you to hold him.
- Do what you're told, bellend.

262
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,666
You need to stretch him out more.
One hand on his neck, one on his tail.

263
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,375
On the bin.

264
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,333
Tighter on his tail.
You need to wrap your fist around it.

265
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,416
What are you gonna-- Jesus, fuck!

266
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,583
It's my grandfather's. Samurai steel.

267
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,208
You're from Vietnam, Darren.

268
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,083
There is no way you're descended
from a samurai.

269
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:12,250
Well, my friend,
that's what we're about to find out.

270
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,708
Oh, for Christ's sake.

271
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,000
Don't piss your pants,
I've practiced this.

272
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,333
Stay really still,
and nothing bad will happen.

273
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,333
Darren, this is nuts.

274
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,291
The mind's eye sees everything.

275
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,541
You'll hit my head
or cut off one of my hands.

276
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,666
- The true warrior does not waver.
- They'll put you in juvie!

277
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,083
Oi! What are you students doing?

278
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,000
What the bloody hell is going on here?

279
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,416
Those lab rats are school property.

280
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,666
Come with me, pal.

281
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,250
So answer me this, Eli Bell.

282
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,500
In a country such as ours,

283
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,666
blessed as it is with natural advantages,

284
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,625
why our young folks should be so drawn
to crime and petty misdemeanors?

285
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:08,916
Uh, I don't know, sir, but I--

286
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,375
I personally blame a lack
of physical exercise.

287
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,916
What were your friends doing behind
the science block in the first place?

288
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,833
Smoking?

289
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,916
Playing with yourselves?

290
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,708
Oh, they're not my friends, sir. I was--

291
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:25,458
Don't lie to me, Eli.
You're really not very good at it.

292
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,708
Who else was with you?

293
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,708
Oh, uh, they could've been
from outside the school, actually.

294
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,666
One was big and fat and
the other was a little Vietnamese guy.

295
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,583
Yes, well, that's a fair description
of half of my PE class.

296
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,041
I'm gonna need names.

297
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,916
Drop your strides.

298
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,416
Uh, my-- my what, sir?

299
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,708
Your shorts, off.

300
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:00,958
All right, now bend over.

301
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,541
Come on! Bend over.

302
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:08,416
I'm not gonna tell you it won't hurt,
'cause hurting is the point.

303
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:14,291
Punishment will cease when you tell me
the name of your co-conspirators.

304
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,500
Mm, my what, sir?

305
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,875
Why does no one speak English?
Your partners in crime.

306
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,791
-Your associates!
-Ah! Jesus.

307
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,083
Jesus, I'm quite convinced,

308
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,791
was neither fat nor Vietnamese.

309
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,291
Do we have a name yet?

310
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,875
Regarding on
how to deal with bullies,

311
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,041
you really only have two options.

312
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:43,958
Either keep out of their way
or take matters into your own hands.

313
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,000
Problem with option two being

314
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,416
you never know
how that's all going to end.

315
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:01,666
So the closer I get to being released,
the more I adhere to the prisoner's code.

316
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,416
Stay out of it,

317
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,125
don't rat on mates,

318
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,208
keep your trap shut.

319
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,541
Your silence is admirable,
but it's misguided.

320
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:18,333
I already know the answer,
I just wanna hear you say it.

321
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:23,791
Very well.

322
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,125
Mum, Lyle?

323
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:51,416
Mum?

324
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,375
Gus, we shouldn't.

325
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,916
Lyle'll kill us if he finds us in here.

326
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,250
Gus, we can't!

327
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,500
No one's been here
since the thing with Mum.

328
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:58,416
Come back.

329
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,875
- What are we supposed to do with Mum?
- Sorry, mate.

330
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,541
-Lyle!
-I'll be back, I-- I promise.

331
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,250
Lyle!

332
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,958
I gotta get myself
straightened out.

333
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,000
I'll be back, I promise, mate.

334
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,125
I'm sorry, mate!

335
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,708
Lyle!

336
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:25,375
Gus!

337
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,375
Gus, Lyle's back!

338
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,291
-Lyle!
-Hey!

339
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:35,083
Hello, mate!

340
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:36,875
Let me look at you.

341
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:38,583
Ah.

342
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:42,541
How's Frankie?

343
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:43,666
Still pretty bad.

344
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:46,666
All right, let's go get her sorted.

345
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:51,583
Boys, boys, boys, boys…

346
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:53,125
Boys!

347
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:58,458
Boys! Boys!

348
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:07,958
You fucking arsehole! Fuck!

349
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:11,083
You're a fucking pig! Fuck!

350
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:14,250
I fucking hate you!

351
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,625
Boys, help me! Boys!

352
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:29,250
Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me.

353
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:31,750
- Please.
- Boys, it's gonna be all right.

354
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,666
Boys. Boys.

355
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:39,541
I know you can fucking hear me!

356
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:46,625
Fuck you! Fuck you all!

357
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:49,125
Fuck! Fuck you!

358
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,791
How did you know about this?

359
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,000
This is insane.

360
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,166
For what? What are we waiting for?

361
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:03,500
Don't answer it!

362
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,333
Eli.

363
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:21,125
-Eli?
-Who is this?

364
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,625
I'll give you three guesses.

365
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,541
No idea. Is this Alex?

366
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:28,083
There's a million Alexes.

367
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,958
He's my pen friend,
doing time in Boggo Road Gaol.

368
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,083
Slim introduced us.

369
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,125
I guess any friend
of the taxi driver killer…

370
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:35,333
He didn't kill that guy!

371
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:37,625
If Slim's your babysitter,
he'd have to say that.

372
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:40,250
My mum said he didn't,
and my mum's not capable of lying.

373
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:43,375
Everybody lies,
the saints and the sinners.

374
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,666
The trick is knowing which one
you're talking to. Good luck, Eli.

375
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:50,458
You two better not be down there.

376
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,916
Oh, no! Come on, Gus.

377
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:59,375
Oi! You little mongrels,
get back up here right now!

378
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:01,458
-Go, Gus!
-Don't you do that, Gus! Gus!

379
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:03,541
- Eli!
- Go, Gus, move!

380
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,833
Get up here right now,
you two little mongrels!

381
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:06,791
What's happening?

382
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:09,625
The fucking kids
are in the emergency tunnel!

383
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:12,250
Right, boys, this is it.
You're in big shit.

384
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:14,958
What are you gonna do?

385
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:18,541
Ugh. If they don't bury themselves alive,
I'll fuckin' murder 'em.

386
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:21,333
Lyle, go easy on them.

387
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:23,333
Gus, wait for me!

388
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,583
Gus.

389
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:27,708
Gus! Gus!

390
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:30,583
Gus, I'm stuck! Gus, come back.

391
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,208
Uh, just make sure they're safe,
will ya?

392
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:42,583
Something-- It smells like poo!

393
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,125
Where are we?

394
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:48,166
You're right where you belong,
you little wankers.

395
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,541
You're very lucky
you both weren't buried alive.

396
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:51,583
Now come on out.

397
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:54,583
-Rack off. You'll give us a floggin'.
-Dead fuckin' right, I am, mate.

398
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:56,458
-Well, fuck that, then.
-Don't swear!

399
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:59,291
-You just did.
-Yeah, well, I'm an adult, aren't I?

400
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:00,250
You tell me, Lyle.

401
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:03,000
I thought adults were supposed to
learn from their mistakes.

402
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:05,083
You and Mum are dealing again.
It's the truth, innit?

403
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:09,375
Just announce it to the whole
bloody neighborhood, won't you?

404
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,583
Here. Now, get a hold of that

405
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:18,083
before you both get
bloody polio or hepatitis.

406
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:20,583
Fuck you, Lyle.
We spoke to that bloke on the phone.

407
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:23,041
-How come he knows my name?
-What bloke?

408
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,583
There's no bloke on the phone.
It's not even connected!

409
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:28,416
Me and Gus deserve some answers!

410
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,291
You know what?
You deserve to stay down there

411
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:33,625
until you, little man,
learn some bloody manners.

412
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:40,500
Has Lyle got Mum using again?

413
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,166
Fucking Lyle.

414
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:53,541
Eli!

415
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:56,375
Eli!

416
00:30:57,291 --> 00:30:59,458
Just let her rant and rage,
okay, boys?

417
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:04,416
I know it's difficult,
but we just gotta wait around, okay?

418
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,125
He's tryin' to kill me, Eli.

419
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:10,916
Call the cops! He's tryin' to kill me.

420
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,958
Call them and tell he's gonna murder me.

421
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:27,458
Eli.

422
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:30,791
Eli!

423
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:33,041

Group…

435
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:33,875
Group hug.

436
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:50,916
You think he's gone out yet?

437
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:01,625
I'm sorry, Frankie.

438
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,458
Pretty crappy at this dad stuff.

439
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:07,916
No.

440
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:10,750
You're great, Lyle.

441
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:11,833
Hm?

442
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:19,541
We'd have been up shit creek
without a paddle

443
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:21,083
if you hadn't given us a home.

444
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:22,166
Oh.

445
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:25,666
-Not much of a home though, is it?
-Yes, it is.

446
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,750
The boys worship you.

447
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:33,291
And I kinda like you too.

448
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:42,333
Come on, give me a leg up.
Come on, Gus…

449
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:45,250
Don't, Gus! I'm falling!

450
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,708
Gus!

451
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:50,583
Come on, Gus, push!

452
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:57,083
Ah, where are the bloody buttons
on this thing?

453
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:00,750
Blech.

454
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:16,041
You boys learned your lesson?

455
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:18,208
Is Lyle still mad at us?

456
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:20,416
Yeah, no, he's settled.
He's watching the footy.

457
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,083
So he's not gonna flog us?

458
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:25,458
Not if you say you're sorry.

459
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:40,458
"Act of having it off," ten letters.

460
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:44,041
Something, something, "P," something, "T."

461
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,541
Amputation.

462
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,166
- Mum.
- Mm?

463
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,875
Just promise you and Lyle
aren't using again.

464
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:56,958
I promise.

465
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:06,458
"Family embrace," five and three.

466
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,833
Excuse me.

467
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,791
Good night.

468
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,541
Why did you run away from our dad?

469
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:24,250
Eli, it's late.
I don't wanna talk about Robert right now.

470
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,541
He did bad things, didn't he?

471
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:31,291
We all do bad things sometimes.

472
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,541
Alcoholism is a disease.

473
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:37,208
He wasn't a well man.

474
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:40,666
Was he a good man?

475
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:43,291
He was a good dancer.

476
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:48,375
-Was he more like me or more like Gus?
-I don't know, Eli.

477
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:52,208
He was… like both of you.

478
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,833
Was he scary sometimes?

479
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,083
Like Gus is scary.

480
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:00,250
Gus isn't scary.

481
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,583
Yes, he is.

482
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:04,375
Yeah? In what way?

483
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:08,541
I dunno. It's the stuff he writes
in the air with his magic finger.

484
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:14,125
It's like he can hop forwards through time
and send back messages from the future.

485
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:16,583
Maybe he can.

486
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:19,541
You ever considered that possibility?

487
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:24,625
All I know is that boy loves you
more than he can say.

488
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:29,333
When you were born, he guarded your crib
like all human life depended on it.

489
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:32,333
He's the best friend you'll ever have.

490
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:36,625
And you're the best mum.

491
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:41,375
Nah.

492
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,500
Probably a bit below average,
but that's very kind of you to say.

493
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:49,375
No, really, you're too good
for this shitty place.

494
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:51,750
You were too good for Dad,
and now you're too good for Lyle.

495
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:52,666
Don't.

496
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,416
You could've been a teacher
or a school counselor,

497
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
not living
with some drop-kick heroin pusher.

498
00:38:57,583 --> 00:38:59,625
That's enough. Go to bed.

499
00:39:57,666 --> 00:39:59,125
I'm going after him.

500
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,833
Check where he goes. You coming?

501
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:12,125
Oh.

502
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:34,791
Don't move.

503
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:40,458
Tink, if you're gonna be a ninja,
last thing you wanna wear

504
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:42,833
is blue pajamas
with half your arse hangin' out.

505
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:44,125
I can see your Aussie white bum

506
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:46,125
flashing on and off
like a fuckin' lighthouse.

507
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:48,041
Hi, Darren.

508
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:51,291
You know, if I chopped your head off,
your brain'd stay alive for three minutes.

509
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:54,000
You could carry on talking
till you lost all consciousness.

510
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:56,416
I don't think that's true.

511
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:58,333
Only one way to find out.

512
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:04,333
Did you shit yourself?

513
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:05,541
Almost.

514
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:09,583
What's Lyle doing here?

515
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:11,125
Uh…

516
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:13,458
I reckon he's collecting heroin
from your mum.

517
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:19,416
Very good, bellend.
Who else knows what he's up to?

518
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,208
The guy on the phone, maybe.

519
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,291
What guy on the phone?

520
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:28,083
There was a guy on the phone.
I spoke to him by accident.

521
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:31,250
He seemed to know what was going on.

522
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,708
Could've been Ivan Kroll.

523
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:36,458
-Who's Ivan Kroll?
-Just an arsehole with a motorbike.

524
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:39,291
You see on the news
about that bloke who lost an arm?

525
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:41,166
That was probably Ivan's work.

526
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:44,375
Wanna eat something?

527
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:47,416
-I'll be all right.
-You better come in.

528
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,291
Be rude not to.

529
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,750
Shoes off, dick wad.

530
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:07,916
Check this out.

531
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:20,208
Go on, have a look.

532
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,166
…so much money. It's the best.

533
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,125
So when did Lyle go back
to dealing smack?

534
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:35,041
What makes you think
he ever stopped?

535
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:36,708
He just moved up the ladder.

536
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:40,458
Sucks, doesn't it?
Thinking you're with the good guys

537
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:42,333
and discovering you're the bad guys.

538
00:43:42,416 --> 00:43:43,291
Darren!

539
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,958
-Come, she'd like to meet you.
-Oi!

540
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:53,458
Found this one spying in the yard.

541
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:58,166
-The one who didn't rat about the rat.
-Eli, what are you doin' here?

542
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,083
Darren invited me.

543
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:03,083
It's 1:00 in the morning. Go home!

544
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:06,458
-'Kay, I'm going.
-You always give up that easy?

545
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:11,208
Why did you come here?

546
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:14,291
Because he's an idiot.

547
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:17,541
- Just followed Lyle.
- Mm.

548
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:19,791
Because?

549
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:25,333
You have question for him.

550
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:28,125
-Okay, that's enough, guys.
-I say when it's enough.

551
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:31,625
Okay.

552
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:35,500
Come here, boy.

553
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:40,000
Closer.

554
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:44,083
Why don't you ask Lyle

555
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:46,708
your most important question?

556
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:51,750
I'll make sure that he answer truthfully.

557
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,125
Why are you dealing drugs again?

558
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,125
-For the money, mate.
-So why are we still poor?

559
00:45:06,208 --> 00:45:07,625
I said one question.

560
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:11,000
Now it's my turn.

561
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:16,125
Why didn't you rat on my son?

562
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:23,166
It's the prisoner's code.
Stay out of it, keep your trap shut.

563
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:29,500
You taught him well.

564
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:35,416
You can both leave now.

565
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,666
Okay.

566
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,458
Bring him back another time.

567
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:41,458
Maybe we talk about work opportunity.

568
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:43,000
Okay, thank you.

569
00:45:43,916 --> 00:45:44,750
Eli?

570
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:48,000
When he say it just for the money,

571
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:50,416
the money is for your family.

572
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:54,291
He's doing this because he loves you.

573
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:05,041
Off to bed.

574
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,041
Lyle.

575
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:15,875
Lyle, come back.

576
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,000
Please, Lyle!

577
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:21,291
Don't you ever follow me again, you hear?

578
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,750
- Lyle! Lyle!
- That was really embarrassing.

579
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:28,750
You're embarrassed?
Lyle, you're a fucking drug dealer!

580
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:31,166
I mean, what the fuck is it
with you and Mum?

581
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,583
"Do your homework!
Eat your broccoli! Tidy the kitchen!"

582
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,916
I mean, like, Mum's an addict,

583
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,375
and you're the idiot who got her hooked!

584
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:43,333
Righto, come on, let's go, mate.

585
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,000
Oh, what-- Get up, Eli.
What are you doing? Get up.

586
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:49,375
-Get up!
-I can't.

587
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:51,666
You're just gonna push me down again.

588
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:56,916
Don't cry, you great big pussy.
What are you crying for?

589
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,500
I don't know.

590
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:01,833
I just got a whole lot of tears inside me.

591
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:03,583
I can't help it.

592
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:11,333
Here, clean yourself up.

593
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:13,791
Take it.

594
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:37,500
Now, I know dealin' smack
is a shitty way to make a livin',

595
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:40,250
but no one gets rich
doing an honest job anymore.

596
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,166
-That's kinda what Darren said.
-Oh, did he, now?

597
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:45,666
Honestly.

598
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:50,125
Pretty soon, mate,
we're gonna be away from this place.

599
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:53,208
Things are gonna get good, I promise.

600
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:56,916
Things are gonna get so good
you'll forget they were ever bad.

601
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:06,250
You ever wondered why you cry so easily?

602
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:09,125
'Cause I'm a pussy.

603
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:13,833
No, because you're a good kid,
and don't you ever be ashamed of crying.

604
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:16,666
You cry because you give a shit.

605
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:19,666
People that don't cry,
they don't give a shit,

606
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:23,166
and God knows there's enough
of them fuckwits at large in the world.

607
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:31,291
You good?

608
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:34,625
You done crying?

609
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:36,166
Yep.

610
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:43,208
All right, let's go home.

611
00:48:57,208 --> 00:48:59,208
Right, mate,
straight to bed, okay?

612
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:29,125
Hey.

613
00:49:30,541 --> 00:49:34,041
Mum isn't using,
but Lyle's dealing like we thought.

614
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:36,000
And Bich Dang offered me a job.

615
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:37,583
I reckon we can help him.

616
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:41,375
You know, go into business together,
make a shitload of money,

617
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:44,916
finally get the cash
to move Mum away from here.

618
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:49,041
What do you reckon?

619
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:14,875
I'm gonna be dead tomorrow.

620
00:50:57,166 --> 00:50:58,291
This is a test.

621
00:50:58,375 --> 00:51:00,875
No test is worth anything
unless it's difficult to pass.

622
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:02,375
And this is yours.

623
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:06,250
Bobby!

624
00:51:07,166 --> 00:51:10,291
You look how happy your mum is.
Why would you want anyone to risk that?

625
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:11,750
Robert's your father.

626
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:14,125
Are you all right, Dad? Whoa!

627
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,875
It's gonna get better, Frankie.

628
00:51:15,958 --> 00:51:18,125
It's gonna get so good
you'll forget it was ever bad.

629
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:21,083
Ivan Kroll is a bogeyman
to keep everyone in line.

630
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:24,666
Any word of Lyle?

631
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,375
No, but I'll find him
before anything bad happens to him.

632
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:32,291
Sometimes bad things happen
to get good things.

633
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:36,791
I promise you that our sacred mission
has only just begun.

634
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:37,916
Where's my mum?

635
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,833
Your mum is in prison.

636
00:51:39,916 --> 00:51:41,333
I wanna see my boys!

637
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:43,666
- Are you real?
- It's not a dream, Mum.

638
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:46,791
It's just you and me, Gus.
No one's going to help us.

639
00:51:48,791 --> 00:51:51,208
Caitlyn Spies? I'm Eli Bell.

640
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:54,041
You and me, we're the daylight.

641
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:56,458
Sending our boys
out into the world,

642
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:57,833
it's something to be proud of.

643
00:51:57,916 --> 00:52:00,000
Pain and pleasure's all part
of being human.

644
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:02,250
And if it doesn't hurt,
not real life, mate.
