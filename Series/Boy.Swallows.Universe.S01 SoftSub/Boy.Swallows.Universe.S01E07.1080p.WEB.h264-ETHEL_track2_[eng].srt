1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,041
Go on, have another one.

2
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,708
Thanks, Mrs. Bell.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,583
Although, you…
you and your bikie mates,

4
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:22,916
you're… you're not exactly
law-abiding citizens.

5
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,000
Mate, the Rebels
have heaps of laws.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,875
And I know, because I enforce them.

7
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:33,000
It's a fine couple of boys
you've raised here.

8
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,333
Yeah, we've done our best
for them.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,833
You know, Eli's letters,
they were the best thing about my lag.

10
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,875
Didn't care about my bad reputation,
didn't judge.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,875
Anyway, mate, that's why I was droppin' by

12
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,375
to give you this.

13
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:51,875
- Really?
- Yeah, go on.

14
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,458
Apologies
for the wrappin', mate.

15
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,166
Us bikies aren't known
for our gift wrappin'.

16
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,958
You always said in your letters
that you wanted to be a writer,

17
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,041
so this is for your journalizing.

18
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,041
Well, go on, mate,
open it up, give it a crack.

19
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,000
Say something into it.

20
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,666
Testing, testing, one, two, three.

21
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,625
Yeah.

22
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,208
Testing, testing, one, two, three.

23
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:29,333
There you go, mate.
You'll be a journo in no time.

24
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:30,833
Well, that's his dream.

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,375
It's not really easy.
I mean, you gotta get a cadetship

26
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,208
or write a story
no one's even heard of before.

27
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,000
You know what, mate,
I've got stacks of those.

28
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:43,208
I've already done my time,
they can't lock me up for that shit again.

Who wants to know?

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,958
This is Brian Robertson
from The Courier-Mail.

69
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,291
I've got this kid
sitting opposite me, Eli Bell.

70
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,041
Says you told 'im your life story.

71
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,916
Yeah, that sounds like somethin' I'd do.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So you better print
every fuckin' word of it.

73
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,458
Have you seen how long it is?

74
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,916
This kid thinks
he's Brisbane's answer to Leo Tolstoy.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,208
And how the fuck do you know
that he's not?

76
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:09,500
So what do you think Mr. Bermuda's plans
are now that he's outta prison?

77
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:14,791
Well, um, my brother Gus, he wants 'im
to try and get into some charity work.

78
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,708
Alex says he's got some experience
collecting cash.

79
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,125
I have no doubt he does.

80
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,250
So, how much do you want for this?

81
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,791
I dunno. What do you usually pay?

82
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,333
I mean, 'cause-- 'cause
what I really want is a job.

83
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,250
Doing what?

84
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,541
Assistant crime reporter.

85
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,083
Dream on, mate.

86
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,500
Are you even outta school?
That's never gonna happen.

87
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,958
But I could use you to write color pieces.

88
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,166
What are color pieces?

89
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,666
Oh, it's basically the descriptive stuff
we print up to, uh, make up the space.

90
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,916
Real estate blurbs, Toowoomba flower show,
best grandma competition.

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,750
Not everyone can do it, but trust me…

92
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,666
…you're a natural.

93
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,250
Okay.

94
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:05,916
All right, I will tell Shirley
to put you on a starting wage.

95
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,500
All right.

96
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,333
- Welcome to the team.
- Thanks.

97
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:14,208
Everybody, this is Eli Bell.

98
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,666
He wants your job.

99
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,208
Fuck off.

100
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:27,541
…which makes 223,000 raised so far,
but that's still below our target.

101
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,625
Thank you all so much for your time.

102
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:41,541
Hi. Thank you so much.
Very nice to meet you.

103
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, fuck.

104
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,291
- Ow!
- You all right?

105
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,458
Yep, I'm okay.

106
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:55,541
Oh!

107
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,458
All right.

108
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,583
Try that.

109
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,000
Uh, yeah, good. Fuck!

110
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,666
Put it-- Put it in neutral, eh?
Fuckin' 'ell.

111
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,000
Try it now.

112
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:11,666
Hey!

113
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,708
- Oi, guess what?
- What?

114
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,791
- I got the job.
- What?

115
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,833
- How good's that?
- What did I tell you?

116
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,916
Oh, I'm a proper journalist now.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,083
Wow. Oh, Eli, I'm so proud of you, mate.
That's incredible.

118
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,500
- Oi, guess what?
- What?

119
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:29,583
Got the bloody job.

120
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,208
- Really? Good job!
- Thanks.

121
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,333
He's a journalist. Eh?

122
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,708
Now, we can talk
about that 50 bucks you owe me.

123
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,416
- How about you start workin'?
- I'm fixin' the car, mate.

124
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,041
-Did you get it goin'?
-She's hummin' like a tuna patty.

125
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,083
It's so clean now.

126
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,791
Smooth ride. That's my fella.

127
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,083
- I gotta go.
- All right.

128
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,125
-You're a champion, mate.
-Thanks, Dad.

129
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,291
Whoa. Whoa.

130
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,875
- Congratulations.
- G'day, mate.

131
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,958
My son got a job as a journalist.

132
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,291
Here we go.

133
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,958
Oh.

134
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,416
Our Man in Havana. Have you read this?

135
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,791
Yeah, yeah, sad to see that one go.
It's my favorite Graham Greene.

136
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,833
-Ah, Jane Austen.
-Yeah.

137
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,666
-She's comin' back into fashion.
-Mm. Yeah.

138
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,625
"The gentleman
that takes no pleasure from a good novel

139
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,541
must be intolerably stupid."

140
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,333
I'll take all these. Uh…

141
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,458
Eh?

142
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,000
Twenty bucks for the lot?

143
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,708
Eh?

144
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,833
Thanks, boys. Thank you, yep.

145
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:29,750
Wow.

146
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,208
You look happy.

147
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:36,291
Yeah, well, he's gonna take a dozen boxes,
and he wants to pay me money

148
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,500
to look after the shop
three days a week. Me!

149
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,375
-Wow.
-Yeah.

150
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,875
What about your agoraphobia?
You know, with all those customers.

151
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,166
Oh ho.

152
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,208
Frankie, it's a bookshop in Darra.

153
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't think
I'll be fightin' off the crowds.

154
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,791
But yeah, I'll be bringin' in some money
and, uh, ya know,

155
00:07:56,375 --> 00:08:00,458
either way, I… I reckon I owe you,
Frankie.

156
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,833
I owe you too.

157
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,625
You did a pretty good job with those boys
all that time I was inside.

158
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,625
Not really, but, uh, thanks.

159
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:22,125
And I appreciate you keeping
off the bottle since I moved in.

160
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,083
I know you're making an effort.

161
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,125
You know, the truth is, I…

162
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,791
I don't really miss it that much.

163
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,458
But, uh, I think havin'
the boys and… and you here just…

164
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,333
just calms me down a bit.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But don't worry…
…I'll manage without youse.

166
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:56,291
I-- I'm not developing a dependency
or anything, just…

167
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,250
It just feels nice.

168
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,666
Bloody good day, though, eh? What a day!

169
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,875
Cracker.

170
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,458
Good work
with that bank info from Vanuatu.

171
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,750
But keep the rest of it under your hat,
these walls have ears.

172
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,458
Caitlyn.

173
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,166
Eli? What the hell?

174
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,083
I did as you said, gave Brian Robertson
an, uh, article he couldn't refuse.

175
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,708
Oh my God, high five.

176
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,333
-What was the article?
-Um, "Alex Bermuda, My Life in Crime."

177
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,208
-That was you?
-Yeah.

178
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,000
Well, I mean, Dave Cullen rewrote it,

179
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,083
but it was based
off of my initial interview.

180
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,583
Yeah, typical. Well, I hope
they're at least paying you properly.

181
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,541
Um, they got me on a starter salary.

182
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,708
How much is that?

183
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,666
I dunno. Didn't ask.

184
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,291
Well, if it's less than 200 a week,
ask for a pay raise.

185
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,583
Okay. How was Vanuatu?

186
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,375
Who said I was in Vanuatu?

187
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,250
Uh, I overheard Brian.

188
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,083
Yeah, it was fine.
Good place for a holiday.

189
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,083
Well, I'll see you around, eh?

190
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,083
Uh…

191
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:33,916
What on earth are you doin'?

192
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,375
Uh…

193
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:39,083
Just tryin' to
get into some shape, ya know?

194
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,083
Mm…

195
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,000
- Are you doin' this for Mum?
- Mm. No. No.

196
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,750
Well, I dunno, maybe.

197
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:52,083
Lyle was, uh,
pretty muscular, yeah?

198
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,500
Yeah, he was a boxer once.

199
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,875
Yeah, women love muscular arms.

200
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,208
I dunno why. I--
I don't have much in the arms department.

201
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,583
Yeah, look, I don't think Mum
left you just because of the arms.

202
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:04,666
Just sayin'.

203
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,041
No, you're right.

204
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,291
Plenty of other stuff to…
…make up for.

205
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,833
You stood up to Teddy, so that's a plus.

206
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,791
- Well, not really.
- You were good, Dad.

207
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,250
I mean, you didn't freak out
like you normally do.

208
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,625
I like it when you call me Dad.

209
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,416
You reckon she still thinks Lyle's alive?

210
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,250
No, she knows Lyle's
not comin' back, Dad.

211
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,708
Nice day. Yeah.

212
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,375
Yeah. Ah, it's pretty good.

213
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,708
Wha!

214
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,875
- If you love someone, right…
- Yeah.

215
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,541
…I think you've just gotta do things
that you normally wouldn't do.

216
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,791
-Like what?
-I dunno, stuff that terrifies you.

217
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,291
Like goin' to the supermarket or…

218
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,125
-Yeah.
-…something.

219
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:07,125
You've obviously given this some thought.
You got your eye on someone at work, mate?

220
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,625
There's this one person.

221
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,875
But, um, nah, she's outta my league.

222
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,750
Yeah, well, you know, I thought
that at the start with me and your mum,

223
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,333
but, ya know,
you never know until you ask.

224
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,041
And now to a story
of local champions.

225
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,875
Listeners may remember
a young lady named Shelly Huffman,

226
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,166
whose life was changed
by an anonymous gift of $50,000.

227
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,958
There seems to be no stopping
this young lady…

228
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:41,166
Eli? Robert? Shelly's on the radio.

229
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,333
…who have so far raised
more than $200,000

230
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,083
for disabled schoolchildren statewide.

231
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,208
The pair have now been included

232
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,916
in this year's list
of Queensland Champions.

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,333
-In recognition of exceptional service.
-Oh my God.

234
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,583
Philanthropist and owner…

235
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,791
- Oh my God.
- …of Atlas Prosthetics, Tytus Broz, says…

236
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:04,041
Oh my God, Gus is gonna be
a Queensland Champion!

237
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,083
-The award ceremony…
-Shush! Shush. Everyone shush.

238
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,083
…will be held
in Brisbane City Hall's concert hall.

239
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,166
What? There's a ceremony?

240
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,208
…Prime Minister Bob Hawke
is facing ongoing scrutiny days after…

241
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,250
Okay, that's it.
No arguments, we're going.

242
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,458
Oh yeah, look, I… I d-- I don't need to go
if there's not enough tickets.

243
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,750
-Uh, you're coming, Robert.
-Okay.

244
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,750
- And what are you grinning at?
- Nothin'.

245
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,750
How did I not know about this?

246
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,166
This is, uh, front-page news.

247
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,791
Aren't you supposed to be a news reporter?

248
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,250
All right, Dave Cullen,
I want you to follow up

249
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,833
on the legless corpse
they found at Indooroopilly.

250
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,875
Is it the drug wars
or is it something else?

251
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,291
Caitlyn, you're still
on the special investigation we discussed?

252
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,250
Yeah? All right, Carl,
you're gonna tag team with Sam

253
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,958
on the state of the National Party.

254
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,458
Now, as I see it,
there are two parts to that story.

255
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,791
Is Queensland going down the toilet,

256
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:04,958
and how does Mike Ahern plan
to get us out of the toilet.

257
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,625
So, what else have we got?

258
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,750
Ooh, does anyone wanna write

259
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,666
on the annual
Queensland Champions wankfest?

260
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,416
-Um, actually, I--
-Eli, you're not even supposed to be here.

261
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
No, I know.
It's just that my brother's on the list--

262
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,375
Why, what did he do?
Pogo-stick to Cape York?

263
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,375
Actually, he and his friend raised
almost a quarter-million dollars

264
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,125
for people with disabilities.

265
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,208
Okay.

266
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,750
-Do you wanna write that story?
-Yeah.

267
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,500
Actually, Eli, write 'em all.

268
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:40,208
We can use them as, uh, space filler,
before and after the ceremony.

269
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,416
Here you go, knock yourself out.

270
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,083
There's a, uh, housewife there that sailed
single-handedly around the world

271
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:50,208
and a bloke who climbed Everest
with one eye and no toes.

272
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,791
Yeah? Triumph of the human spirit,
"Aren't Aussies amazing?"

273
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:53,750
That sorta thing.

274
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:57,333
- Should I interview Tytus Broz?
- Why do you wanna interview Broz?

275
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,583
He's presenting the awards this year.
I thought it might…

276
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,375
He presents the awards every year.

277
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,708
In fact, it would be news
if he wasn't presenting the awards, so…

278
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,000
Close the door on your way out.

279
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:09,791
Sure.

280
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,208
Why do you wanna
interview Tytus Broz?

281
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,625
Um, 'cause he's hosting the awards
that I'm writing about.

282
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,250
Wanna take a break outside?

283
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,000
Tytus Broz is involved
in some dodgy stuff.

284
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,750
You started all of this, you know?

285
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,041
When you said I should go
and speak to Bich Dang.

286
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,541
She said she thought her life was at risk,

287
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,208
and I dunno, I just--
I just thought she was being paranoid,

288
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,958
but she was dead a few days later.

289
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,000
Supposedly of another stroke.

290
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,250
And then this gets sent to me
at the newspaper.

291
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,666
-What's this?
-Bich Dang's lawyer sent it.

292
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Overseas cash movements
from an account in Vanuatu.

293
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,833
Now, it's an account
secretly owned by Tytus Broz,

294
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,916
with Bich Dang as the sole signatory.

295
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,708
I'm still digging into who he's paying.

296
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,666
My question is, why would Tytus Broz

297
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,666
be in business
with a Vietnamese restaurateur?

298
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:22,916
You know, Tytus Broz hires
ex-crims, current crims, and ex-addicts

299
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,708
to work at his warehouse.

300
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,000
That's how Lyle got a job there.

301
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,875
What if Tytus had Bich Dang
recruit them to sell heroin,

302
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,791
like he did with my stepfather?

303
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,000
Okay, so now we're saying

304
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:39,166
Brisbane's greatest philanthropist
is controlling a heroin business.

305
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,833
What if that's how he got rich?

306
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,291
I mean, I bet you it pays a lot better
than artificial limbs.

307
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:47,875
Okay.

308
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,416
These crims he has around,
do you have any names?

309
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,791
Apart from your stepdad.

310
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,958
Teddy Kallas, all-round sleazebag.

311
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,333
Okay. Anyone else?

312
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,583
Ivan Kroll.

313
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,041
Ivan Kroll is the one
who cut my finger off.

314
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,958
And he's also probably the one
that chopped up my stepdad too.

315
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,166
Have you told anyone this?

316
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,583
No.

317
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,791
Payments from a secret account
owned by Tytus to companies in Australia.

318
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:57,250
The one I really wanted
to talk to you about was this one.

319
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,833
Alpaca Glamour.
What do they make?

320
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,291
Don't tell me, fake pubes.

321
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,125
The company's owned by Ivan Kroll.

322
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:09,583
-So, Tytus is buying alpaca hair?
-Well, a half a million dollars' worth!

323
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,291
Bloke makes a lotta prosthetics.

324
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,333
Well, I don't think
he makes hairy prosthetics, Tim.

325
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,666
Maybe you should ask 'im.

326
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,708
Well, I'd be more interested
in speaking to Ivan Kroll.

327
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:21,791
Mm-hmm.

328
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,875
You in touch with 'im?

329
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,041
Why would I know that scumbag?

330
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,958
Oh, I dunno, just figured
you know every other scumbag.

331
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,083
A colleague of mine saw you and him
together at a function,

332
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,791
a dinner hosted by Bich Dang
before she had a stroke.

333
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:42,875
We may have chatted. You do know
he's never been charged with anything?

334
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,333
So what were you chatting about?

335
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,666
Come on, Cait. You go
to a knees-up for community outreach,

336
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,333
and you have a few sherbets,
and there's a big-time philanthropist,

337
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,916
and some guy whose face he fixed up.

338
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:57,291
-Did you discuss alpaca farming?
-Maybe. Can't remember.

339
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,750
Hey, it's Tim.

340
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,583
Can you please call me on my other phone?

341
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,791
I need to update you on something.

342
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,500
- Hello, is that Mr. Leary?
- Yeah.

343
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,125
Uh, I'm Caitlyn Spies
from The Courier-Mail.

344
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:43,791
Go fuck yourself.

345
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:48,791
That's awesome.

346
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,750
Um, can I just get a bit of clarification

347
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,208
on why you buried
the glass eye in the snow?

348
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:57,041
Actually, it fell outta my pocket
in the push to the summit and…

349
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,625
…I couldn't afford to lose
any more fingers lookin' for it, so…

350
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,166
Right, okay. All right,
I mean, no, fair enough.

351
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,500
Yeah, actually,
it was on the way back down.

352
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,458
Uh, do you mind
if I just give you a call back?

353
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,750
- Oh yeah, sure, yeah, sure, mate.
- Thank you.

354
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,875
Hey, what's goin' on?

355
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,000
Quick update, you were right.

356
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,041
Tytus was making regular payments
to Ivan Kroll.

357
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,000
He also was in business
with Raymond Leary.

358
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:25,916
Who's Raymond Leary?

359
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,958
Remember the guy who tried
to brain himself against the front doors?

360
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,666
- Step away from the glass, please.
- Let me in!

361
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,583
Yeah.

362
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,666
He did a concreting job
for Tytus once.

363
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:39,208
Now he won't speak to me,
but it's possible he'd remember you.

364
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,625
Mr. Leary, I'm Eli Bell.

365
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,500
I'm Caitlyn Spies.

366
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,208
I said I wasn't gonna speak to her.

367
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,791
Mr. Leary, I know the newspaper
didn't handle your complaint well.

368
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,416
They didn't handle it at all.

369
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,583
We're revisiting the case.

370
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,625
Tytus Broz was paying you
from an offshore account.

371
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,041
We're interested
in what you were doing for him.

372
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,875
Look, no one's accusing you of anything,
we just wanna understand

373
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,833
why Tytus Broz was so keen
to keep your project off the books.

374
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,416
I went bankrupt.

375
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,291
My wife killed herself from the stress.

376
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,958
You lot are four years too late.

377
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,000
It's never too late.

378
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:48,708
My pal, Slim Halliday,
he did 25 years in a prison

379
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,666
for a crime he didn't even commit.

380
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,666
He told me you can spend years
thinking about the shitty parts of life,

381
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,875
or you can find a way
back to the good bits.

382
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,541
We just need to know
what you built for Tytus, Mr. Leary.

383
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,083
Please.

384
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,875
Yeah, here's the, uh--
the initial specs.

385
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,041
He had this medical architect,

386
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:20,416
who used to change the specs
and then blame me for the cock-up.

387
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,458
What's a, uh-- a medical architect?

388
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,875
Architect for hospitals
and shit. Excitable little prick.

389
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:29,166
Nothin' was standard,
all the fittings were imported.

390
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,375
Who knows what it was?

391
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,791
What do you reckon
Tytus was building in his backyard?

392
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:34,833
No idea.

393
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,833
Sterile area, chemical storage, research.

394
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,208
It's obviously much more
than just a drug operation.

395
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,666
Leary was nervous
just talking about it.

396
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,041
Is it Ivan Kroll he's scared of?

397
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,791
You know he chops up people
with chainsaws, right?

398
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:55,291
You know, I'm sure he wants
everyone to believe that.

399
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:59,625
But the thing about these people
that live in the shadows,

400
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:03,625
they're only safe when no one knows
much about them, ya know?

401
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:05,958
As soon as their crimes
become public knowledge,

402
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:07,708
their power evaporates.

403
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:10,708
Cops withdraw protection,
witnesses start to talk.

404
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:14,583
Daylight catches up to them
and they're a pile of dust.

405
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:19,166
You and me, we're the daylight.

406
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:41,541
This is a picturesque spot.

407
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:58,083
I came to say that I'm gonna have to draw
a line under our relationship for now.

408
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,666
That kid whose hand you remodeled,
Eli Bell,

409
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:05,125
he's working for the newspaper now.

410
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:08,458
And they have dug up
some kind of money trail

411
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,166
between you and Tytus Broz…

412
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,291
…that could be embarrassing
for both of you.

413
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,208
Well, the boss won't like that.

414
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:16,916
So…

415
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,000
on balance,

416
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,166
it might be convenient for everyone

417
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,500
if you shift your arse overseas for a bit.

418
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:27,750
I told you years ago, we should've dealt
with those little rat bags.

419
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,166
We're past that now.

420
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,375
Ivan, if you do anything silly,
it's just gonna draw more attention.

421
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:37,375
I mean, drug dealers and scumbags,
it's fine, but newspaper reporters…

422
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:45,000
I mean, I'm sure the boss
wants this all to go away very quietly.

423
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:49,333
Fares to Europe are pretty cheap
this time of year.

424
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,375
Might be a good time to…

425
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:55,958
…I dunno,
research your family ancestry.

426
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,583
Research your own fuckin' ancestry.

427
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:05,000
Just understand, if things do get messy,
it'll be hard for me to cover for you.

428
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,375
Just so we're clear on that.

429
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:12,958
Crystal.

430
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:16,166
Good.

431
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,416
-Thanks for bein' straight with me, Tim.
-Yeah.

432
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,375
Appreciate it. Just need to tidy up.

433
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:11,083
Hi, darling.

434
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:17,000
Oh, darling, hi.

435
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:23,583
Such a good girl.

436
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:34,125
- Eli.
- Jesus! Fuck, Gus.

437
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:35,500
Sorry, I was worried.

438
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,541
I thought I saw Ivan Kroll hangin' around.

439
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:42,041
So I-- I came to get you. You all right?

440
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,375
Fine until you came along
and scared the shit outta me.

441
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:47,250
Let's get goin', hey?

442
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:52,333
What's goin' on? You used to be
Mr. Cool, Calm, and Collected.

443
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,916
- Gus?
- I dunno.

444
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:00,458
I just keep havin' all these bad thoughts.

445
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:03,208
You know, like I did
before Teddy attacked Mum.

446
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:05,500
Well, thanks for tellin' me
that was gonna happen.

447
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,875
Eli… …I didn't know.

448
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:10,541
Honestly, I don't know
what you'd like to imagine,

449
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,541
but I'm not some fortune-teller.

450
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,916
It's just… it's disconnected images
that come to me.

451
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:20,958
I mean, you can't expect me to tell you
every random picture that comes to me.

452
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:23,750
Well, yes, actually, if it's gonna stop us
from being beaten up.

453
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm tryin' to explain to you,
it's-- it's not even complete thoughts.

454
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,083
You know you sound completely mad, right?

455
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:32,750
Yeah, but it's funny, isn't it?

456
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:35,625
All the mad stuff
it keeps turning out to be true.

457
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:03,208
Yeah?

458
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,166
Hi, sorry. Um…

459
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:11,083
I can't sleep
and the light in my room is conked out.

460
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:13,458
Brought a book.

461
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:16,541
Yeah. Uh…

462
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:19,541
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Hop in.

463
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:22,458
Thanks.

464
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:48,333
I-- I can go and sleep on the couch
if you want.

465
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,333
No, it's okay.

466
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:52,250
Hm. Okay.

467
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:02,333
Are we gonna have to talk
about the car accident?

468
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:04,541
Can we not?

469
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:07,666
Okay.

470
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:22,833
You know, I love those boys.

471
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:25,375
I would throw myself
in front of a bus,

472
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,083
if I had to, for them.

473
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,000
Well, let's hope that won't be necessary.

474
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,041
Mum, don't!

475
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,375
-Hi.
-Sorry to wake youse.

476
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:36,666
You need to sign for this.

477
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,750
You know there's a doorbell, right?

478
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:41,750
- Oh, well, there used to be a doorbell.
- Hm.

479
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:44,000
Okay.

480
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,375
- Have a good day.
- Thanks. Cheers.

481
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:49,083
Whoo.

482
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:56,000
"Queensland Champions
official presentation of awards."

483
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,875
- Ta-da!
- Did you and Dad just, um--

484
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,958
-No.
-Well, I didn't finish my sentence yet.

485
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:04,875
Well, don't, 'cause we weren't.

486
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,083
And even if we were,
it's none of your business.

487
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:10,250
Okay. Well, can you just be careful
opening the door?

488
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:13,916
Eli, I think I'm old enough
to answer the door by myself.

489
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:20,291
-You're not getting it too now, are you?
-Wait. Getting what?

490
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:24,000
You know, the, uh… agoraphobia.

491
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,000
-No, no. I just care about ya, that's all.
-Okay.

492
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:33,333
Oh, Eli, that's sweet,
but I think I can take care of myself.

493
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:48,458
That update for you, line one.

494
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:50,333
Thank you, Sophie.

495
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,500
Just to let you know,
that matter we discussed

496
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:57,291
is now dead and buried.

497
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:00,541
We can discuss the journalist too if--

498
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,666
No, it's all coming from the kid.

499
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,458
I'll get 'im out here
and find out what they know.

500
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,208
What's goin' on?

501
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:32,875
Tim Cotton's disappeared.

502
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:36,333
Shit. Did you go and talk to 'im
about you-know-who?

503
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:38,875
Yeah. He denied all knowledge, of course.

504
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:41,583
- It was almost a--
- Eli, in my office.

505
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:43,791
I'll see you later.

506
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:54,333
This is good stuff. Keep 'em coming.
"My Year Going Backwards" was a cracker.

507
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:57,250
Now, you said you wanted
to interview Tytus Broz.

508
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:58,166
Did I?

509
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,333
So he has just called outta the blue,

510
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:03,458
and has asked us
to give his company a plug.

511
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:07,041
So, all you need to do
is get your skinny arse out to Brookfield.

512
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:10,958
Jeff the photographer has booked a car,
he'll pick you up outside at 2:30.

513
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:14,208
- I've got the Queensland Champions to--
- That's an evening thing.

514
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:16,708
-You'll have heaps of time.
-Was there no one else?

515
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:20,500
Eli, the man asked for you personally,
he's a huge fan of your work.

516
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:25,041
Interviewing someone like Tytus Broz
is a huge step up.

517
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:27,125
Do you want to be a journalist or not?

518
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:28,208
-Yes, I do.
-Good!

519
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:31,083
So get your notebook and fuck off.
You've got five minutes.

520
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:40,291
I think Tytus is on to us.
He wants me to go meet 'im in Brookfield.

521
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,916
I'm comin' with you, okay?
Don't leave without me.

522
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:09,500
- Hi.
- Get in.

523
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:10,541
Okay, fine.

524
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,083
Sorry, I was expecting
Jeff the photographer.

525
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:20,416
-He'll get over it.
-Well, what about Brian?

526
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,666
Fuck Brian.

527
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,666
Look, the main thing
to understand about Brian

528
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,208
is that ultimately,
he's only interested in one thing.

529
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,625
Scoops. Bring 'im a scoop

530
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:30,791
and he'll forgive you
for just about anything.

531
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,875
The thing is, I'm more concerned
about staying alive.

532
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:36,083
Yeah, well, I care about that too, Eli.
What are we?

533
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:40,125
We're the daylight. Here comes the sun.

534
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,291
How do I look?

535
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:07,416
Like Caitlyn Spies in a beanie.

536
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,500
If he's as dangerous
as we think,

537
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:19,583
he's gonna come after you
and me and everyone we love.

538
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:21,875
So don't provoke him too much.

539
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,916
Mr. Broz will receive you
in the reading room. This way.

540
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:01,208
Mr. Broz will be with you shortly.

541
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,708
Who's there? Is this Gus?

542
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:41,708
Uh, I have a question. Uh--

543
00:38:41,791 --> 00:38:43,125
Are-- Are you me?

544
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:45,666
Well, what do you think?

545
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,833
That's just another question.
I-- I need proper answers.

546
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:53,125
There are no proper answers, Gus.
You-- you should know that by now.

547
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:56,458
Everything depends on everything.
Ask me another.

548
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,000
Is…

549
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,666
Is-- Is Eli gonna die?

550
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:04,791
We're all gonna die, Gus.
It's all just a matter of time.

551
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:06,583
Wh--

552
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:13,416
Gus! Are you all right?

553
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:16,916
-Yeah.
-What happened?

554
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,625
I'm just a bit panicky.

555
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:23,083
I hope not,
it's just a bloody award ceremony.

556
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:24,458
No, it's not about that.

557
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,541
Just, I'm… I'm really worried about Eli.

558
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:29,750
Why?

559
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,916
It's just a feeling that he's in trouble…

560
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,166
…that I should be doing
something about it.

561
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,000
Okay.

562
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:40,875
You wanna know what I think?

563
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:42,208
Yeah, always.

564
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:47,208
I think you've always been
his guardian angel,

565
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:49,958
just like my mum is with me.

566
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:54,041
But it's okay to think about yourself,
you know, just for one night.

567
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:57,708
Yeah. Yeah.

568
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:02,708
Eli Bell?

569
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,125
I'm the, um… photographer.

570
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:08,875
Sit.

571
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:22,791
You're Lyle Orlik's stepson.

572
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:24,583
My condolences.

573
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:26,791
Sad loss.

574
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:29,458
Do you like that?

575
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:32,208
It's… certainly very detailed.

576
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:35,208
That's because it's an actual arm.

577
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,250
Someone donated it?

578
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:40,291
A dead person, obviously.

579
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:42,625
Well, the process is called plastination.

580
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:46,916
That's when the bone
and muscle are all turned into plastic.

581
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,958
So, you couldn't actually wear it?

582
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:51,375
No, of course not, it's much too heavy.

583
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:54,833
Electromechanical arms have many problems.

584
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,833
No substitute for the real thing,
unfortunately.

585
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:59,916
-Do you mind if I record this?
-Yes, I do.

586
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:07,250
I remember you made a speech about how
your daughter was born without arms,

587
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:10,083
and that's when you decided
to devote your life to, um,

588
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:11,916
spare parts, or prosthetics.

589
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,125
She faced many challenges.

590
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,541
I notice you've lost
a finger yourself.

591
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,500
Accidentally cut off.

592
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:25,291
Except nothing is entirely accidental…

593
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:27,416
is it?

594
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,708
May I see?

595
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:37,333
Ah…

596
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:39,875
Neat job.

597
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,416
Did you ask them
to sew it back on?

598
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,875
They said they couldn't,
it'd just be stiff and useless.

599
00:41:44,958 --> 00:41:47,541
Same with limbs, same with faces.

600
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:51,041
How to keep everything mobile and flexible
till everything grows back?

601
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:54,166
And are you working on that?

602
00:41:58,375 --> 00:41:59,875
I'm gonna see if it's okay.

603
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:03,458
Damn birds. Brainless creatures.

604
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:07,083
You'd think they'd learn
from their mistakes.

605
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,416
Eli?

606
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:12,083
Excuse me.

607
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,500
It's not dead.

608
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:32,625
"Your end is a dead blue wren."

609
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:34,708
Is that a quote?

610
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,083
It's something my brother said.

611
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:49,166
Eh, it wasn't dead.

612
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,125
Only a matter of time, I imagine.

613
00:42:51,791 --> 00:42:54,666
Can we go for a walk
in your garden?

614
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,041
No. I think you have
everything you need,

615
00:42:57,125 --> 00:43:00,125
and I need to get ready
for this awards thing.

616
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:03,750
-I'll just grab my stuff, then.
-Yeah.

617
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:11,166
Now, you listen to me, Eli Bell.

618
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:13,416
I know exactly who she is,

619
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,875
and I know who you are.

620
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,333
And you know exactly who I am.

621
00:43:27,916 --> 00:43:30,666
Sophie! Let them out.

622
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,500
Did you see when he grabbed my hand,
and he goes "neat job"?

623
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:54,000
As if he's recognized Ivan Kroll's
handiwork and given it a mark outta ten?

624
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,250
So you're not buying
"Brisbane's greatest philanthropist"?

625
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
This is it, Eli, your first scoop.

626
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:05,000
Brian's gonna kill me.

627
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:09,666
No, he'll just yell and thump the table.
I'll explain we were on a scoop, okay?

628
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:12,041
I'm supposed to be at the awards tonight.

629
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:15,833
- I told my brother that I'd be there.
- Eli, just… …focus, okay?

630
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:19,583
Raymond Leary built some kind
of private medical facility for Tytus,

631
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:21,625
possibly funded by the illegal trade
in heroin,

632
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:24,416
and now Tytus doesn't want us
roaming around his property.

633
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:27,041
That doesn't pique your interest
just a little?

634
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:29,208
Is it worth losing my job?

635
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:32,250
We wait till dark,
and make sure Tytus goes,

636
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:34,000
hop over the wall, try the bunker.

637
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:36,000
And if it doesn't work,
we go back to Brisbane.

638
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:40,416
And if Brian threatens to fire you,
I will tell him he has to fire me too.

639
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,208
What do you say?

640
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:50,125
Half an hour to deadline, folks.

641
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:56,083
Now, where's Caitlyn Spies
and where the hell is Eli fucking Bell?

642
00:44:56,958 --> 00:44:58,333
Oh fuck.

643
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:00,583
- Hey.
- What am I doin' here?

644
00:45:00,666 --> 00:45:02,666
Give it here, let me do it.

645
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:03,750
Oh…

646
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:07,416
Hey, relax, you're doing great.

647
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,166
Okay.

648
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,083
And I appreciate you doing this for us.

649
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:14,625
I know that big groups of people
aren't exactly your…

650
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:17,166
…favorite thing
in the world.

651
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:21,125
But it is Gussie's big day
and it's Eli's too, in a way.

652
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:25,666
And it's yours and mine too.

653
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:28,750
Sending our boys out into the world.

654
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:31,083
One's a proper journalist

655
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:33,583
and one's a Queensland Champion.

656
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:34,625
Oh!

657
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:37,166
That's somethin'
to be proud of, hey?

658
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:41,458
Yeah, we did good, Frankie.

659
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:54,625
Oi.

660
00:45:55,791 --> 00:45:56,625
Yeah.

661
00:45:58,875 --> 00:45:59,750
Piece of cake.

662
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:08,041
Ah…

Fuck.

669
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:41,208
Are you all right?

670
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:53,125
-Can I ask you something?
-Is it about work?

671
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:58,375
It's a bit more personal.

672
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:01,708
Okay.

673
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:06,083
I was just wondering how you felt
about colleagues being in relationships.

674
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:07,625
Okay.

675
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,583
I mean, ideally, if we weren't colleagues,
what do you think would've happened?

676
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:20,958
Oh Jesus, Eli, you never give up, do you?

677
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,916
It's a mark of a good journalist.
According to Brian Robertson.

678
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:30,583
Oh shit.

679
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,041
Do you think he saw us?

680
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:46,208
Okay, let's go.

681
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,375
- Ivan.
- Yes, boss?

682
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:55,041
I need you to do something for me.

683
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:58,500
Our young friend and the journalist
are showing an unhealthy interest

684
00:47:58,583 --> 00:48:00,208
in the research facility.

685
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:02,500
-Just get rid of them.
-I'm on my way.

686
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:13,250
Come on.

687
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,458
This is fuckin' insane.

688
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:38,583
This just gets
fuckin' worse and worse.

689
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:56,958
He's farming limbs.

690
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,208
It-- It's
a spare parts facility.

691
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:39,541
You knew him?

692
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:42,333
It's my stepdad.

693
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:48,291
Eli.

694
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:57,833
It's fucking Lyle.

695
00:52:58,541 --> 00:52:59,625
I'm sorry.

696
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:13,000
Hey, stop, what are you doing?

697
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:18,875
- Eli, what do you need that for?
- It's evidence.

698
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:21,458
Okay.

699
00:53:23,791 --> 00:53:24,625
Let's go.

700
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:28,333
Hey, wait. Just…

701
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:43,791
Emergency.
What service do you require?

702
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:45,375
My name is Caitlyn Spies. I'm…

703
00:53:45,458 --> 00:53:49,041
…in some kind of bunker
in the Tytus Broz estate in Brookfield.

704
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:51,083
I'd like to report a murder.

705
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:53,250
Is your own life in danger?

706
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:54,875
Shit.

707
00:54:56,166 --> 00:54:57,541
Whoa!

708
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:01,041
Go! Go! Go!

709
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:36,416
Eli!

710
00:55:45,083 --> 00:55:46,125
The fuck!

711
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:54,791
Oh shit!

712
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:04,625
Eli, come on! Come on. Are you okay?

713
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,666
Oh shit!

714
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:25,291
Oh fuck, did we kill 'im?

715
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:27,416
I don't fuckin' know.
I don't fuckin' care. Just go!

716
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:45,000
Is he following us?

717
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:48,500
I dunno.

718
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:51,458
Oh, fuck, we're in so much shit.

719
00:57:17,458 --> 00:57:18,458
Ooh!

720
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:20,666
Okay.

721
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:22,666
We're good.

722
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:26,750
- Gussie. Shelly, you okay?
- Hey.

723
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:27,666
- Hi, Mum.
- Yeah.

724
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:28,916
Where's Eli?

725
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:33,333
Uh, he's… he's stuck doin' a story
in, um, Brookfield.

726
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:34,666
Brookfield?

727
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,541
It's all right, Mum. He's comin'.

728
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:41,041
I'm gonna give him a ring,
all right?

729
00:57:43,041 --> 00:57:44,166
Is Gussie okay?

730
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:48,250
Um, it's probably nothing.
You know how it is. Pre-match nerves.

731
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:49,416
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

732
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,500
-I'll show you where we're sitting.
-Okay, let's do that. Lead on, MacDuff.

733
00:57:54,416 --> 00:57:56,458
Cabin doors to manual. Comin' through!

734
00:57:56,541 --> 00:57:58,958
- Sorry.
- Champion comin' through.

735
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:05,500
Any word?

736
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:08,166
Anytime now, all right? He's coming.

737
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:22,500
Ladies and gentlemen, honored guests,

738
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:25,416
we are here to celebrate
the accomplishments

739
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,833
of six very special Queenslanders.

740
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:33,500
Would you please give
a warm Brisbane welcome

741
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:37,166
to a man who needs no introduction,

742
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:39,416
Tytus Broz?

743
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:54,708
Thank you, Lady Mayor.

744
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:58,500
I'd like you to come with me
on a journey of discovery.

745
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:08,208
Hey, we're gonna make it, okay? Promise.

746
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:26,916
Biomechanical implants
have restored hearing

747
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,958
to thousands of patients,

748
01:00:29,583 --> 01:00:34,041
and may one day do the same for eyesight.

749
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:47,125
But the ultimate barrier
is not technological,

750
01:00:47,208 --> 01:00:50,000
it's human squeamishness.

751
01:00:59,791 --> 01:01:02,333
And if we can overcome
that final obstacle,

752
01:01:02,416 --> 01:01:04,458
we will arrive very quickly at a time

753
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:09,625
where every single part of the human body
can be replaced by functioning elements,

754
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:13,291
manufactured… or farmed.

755
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:20,125
The future is closer than we may think.

756
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:24,750
Go further,

757
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:27,875
dare to break society's taboos,

758
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:35,416
and never let anyone
stand in the way of your dream.

759
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:42,500
This guy's evil!

760
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:44,500
Don't listen to this bastard!

761
01:01:45,416 --> 01:01:48,000
He cut off my stepfather's head
and put it in a jar

762
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:49,250
so he could experiment on it.

763
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:52,583
- No idea what he's talking about.
- You're a fucking murderer!

764
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:54,833
- He's a fuckin' fraud!
- Can we get security?

765
01:01:56,833 --> 01:01:59,291
- Can we remove this young man?
- He's insane!

766
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:01,208
Mr. Broz, we're taking you in
for questioning.

767
01:02:01,291 --> 01:02:03,875
What are you talking about?
I've done nothing wrong.

768
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:06,916
He's the one you need
to remove from the stage.

769
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:11,166
Uh, I'm terribly sorry,
ladies and gentlemen.

770
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:14,875
We will take a break
until we sort this out.

771
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:23,041
I'm sorry, Mum, it was the only way.

772
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:31,666
Chaos.

773
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:42,500
I've just seen Ivan Kroll.
You need to get your family out of here.

774
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:44,541
Just stick with your family, okay?

775
01:02:44,625 --> 01:02:45,625
See you soon.

776
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,708
Mum! Dad, Gus!

777
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:54,958
Oh!

778
01:02:55,041 --> 01:02:56,291
Oi, hey, no!

779
01:02:58,541 --> 01:02:59,416
Eli!

780
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,916
Eli! Dad!

781
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,958
Oh! Robert! Robert?

782
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:12,291
You stay with Dad, I'll get Eli.

783
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:37,500
I got you. I got you.

784
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:39,166
Hey. Stay with me.

785
01:03:39,666 --> 01:03:42,625
- I love you.
- I got you.

786
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:22,291
Ah!

787
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:19,875
Ah…

788
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:45,916
I'm here.

789
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,583
It's Gus, all right?

790
01:06:58,791 --> 01:07:01,458
Come on, stay with me.
Come on, stay with us all.

791
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:04,666
You're not gonna die, all right?
I promise you're not gonna die.

792
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:06,166
No.

793
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:08,666
No.

794
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:13,875
Eli.

795
01:07:18,291 --> 01:07:19,125
Stay with me.

796
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:28,125
You can't die.

797
01:07:30,291 --> 01:07:32,125
Come on, stay with me.

798
01:07:33,458 --> 01:07:35,583
Promise me you're not gonna die.

799
01:08:59,166 --> 01:09:00,041
Caitlyn?

800
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:02,833
Hi.

801
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,125
You're in hospital.

802
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:17,333
How's Dad?

803
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:18,875
Did he make it?

804
01:09:19,708 --> 01:09:20,541
Yeah.

805
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:24,208
They were just here,
been taking it in turns.

806
01:09:28,166 --> 01:09:29,791
How do you like the family?

807
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:34,458
They're great. I mean,
a lot more normal than I expected.

808
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:37,666
I think they've been working on it.

809
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:54,625
I didn't write this.

810
01:09:55,208 --> 01:09:57,791
No, but you're going to.

811
01:09:58,708 --> 01:09:59,958
It's just a teaser,

812
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:04,041
and Brian's got a whole series planned,
with a TV tie-in.

813
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:08,291
Welcome to the crime desk, partner.

814
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:16,375
-Do you wanna sit up?
-Yeah.

815
01:10:18,125 --> 01:10:19,791
Slim Halliday once told me that…

816
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:22,875
that time can be anything
you want it to be.

817
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:26,791
If you want it to go fast,
you could trick it into whizzing by.

818
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:31,666
And you can slow time down
by focusing on every tiny detail.

819
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,791
I was doing that when I wrote this.

820
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:58,625
There he is!

821
01:10:58,708 --> 01:11:01,041
Oh, good to see
you sittin' up, mate.

822
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:03,750
You had us all a bit worried there.

823
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:06,250
- Oh…
- How's your neck, Dad?

824
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:09,791
Ah, you know, just a nick to the jugular,
it's nothin', mate.

825
01:11:09,875 --> 01:11:12,000
It just looked a lot worse than it is.

826
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:15,125
You took a knife for me,
Dad, you know that.

827
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,458
Ah, just happened to be in the wrong place
at the right time, you know?

828
01:11:20,958 --> 01:11:23,416
Gussie was the real hero of the hour.

829
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,500
Yeah.

830
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:29,791
You saved me, Gussie.

831
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:32,833
Nah, you're all mad.

832
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:36,041
It's funny, isn't it?

833
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,666
How all the mad stuff
turns out to be true.

834
01:11:46,541 --> 01:11:48,500
Come on, all of you.

835
01:11:49,166 --> 01:11:50,041
Group hug.

836
01:11:51,166 --> 01:11:52,750
Oh! Ho!

837
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:54,916

838
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,666

Sorry.

844
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:20,000
Gus was right.
My end was a dead blue wren.

845
01:12:20,083 --> 01:12:23,416
But that moment was also the beginning.
For all of us.

846
01:12:24,125 --> 01:12:25,708
An exploding supernova of stories,

847
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:28,083
endlessly expanding
from that single moment.

848
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:32,416
Looking back on what happened,
it's hard to separate real life

So that's my story.

863
01:13:03,208 --> 01:13:05,583
Quite a lotta this
was foretold by my brother Gus,

864
01:13:05,666 --> 01:13:08,833
when he first saw me yawning
my head off against a background of stars,

865
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:12,291
and suggested that maybe I'd bitten off
a bit more than I could chew.

866
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:15,833
Or, as he put it at the time…
