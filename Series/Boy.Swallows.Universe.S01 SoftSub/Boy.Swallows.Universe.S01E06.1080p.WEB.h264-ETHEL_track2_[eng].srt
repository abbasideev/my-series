1
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,125
Lyle?

2
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,125
Eli.

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,833
Sorry, mate.

4
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:11,458
I can't stop.

5
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,541
I'm on a bit of a roll.

6
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,250
What are you doing here?
I thought you were dead.

7
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,541
I'll always be part of your life, mate.

8
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,333
I'm just lyin' low for a spell.

9
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:28,666
Writin' my novel.

10
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,000
Lyle?

11
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,083
Lyle!

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,875
Lyle!

13
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:55,833
Lyle!

14
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,208
Bermuda, letter.

15
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,958
Dear Alex.
We've been pen pals for four years now.

16
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,458
There's been plenty of changes.

17
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,750
As Slim Halliday always used to say,
"Time is the answer to everything."

18
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,500
Come on.

19
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,458
It was time
and another stroke

20
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,208
that put Bich Dang in a nursing home…

21
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,666
Play.

22
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,541
…and her son Darren
in prison.

23
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:05,875
Oh…

24
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:10,500
Time brought mid-strength beer
to Queensland. Sobered up Dad a bit.

25
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,541
Time made Gus a little more talkative,
but not enough to be noticed.

26
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,083
And finally,

27
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,000
finally,

28
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,416
time got our mum outta prison.

29
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,750
So it was time to dig up the money
and buy Mum a house.

30
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,083
Gimme a hand with this.

31
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:44,166
- Fuckin' hell. It's there.
- Boys?

32
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,958
Come on, hurry up.

33
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,625
Mum's old typewriter.

34
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,416
Let's go. Come on.

35
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,166
Boys, what are you doin' down there?

36
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,041
Sorry, I just found Mum's old typewriter.

37
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,958
Yeah, doozy. Come up quick,
wash your hands. Dinner's on.

38
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,541
Don't want it to get cold.
Got peas, Gussie.

39
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,416
Okay. Let's, uh, put that away, mate.
Let's eat. Come on.

40
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,875
- Cheers, Dad.
- That's all right, mate.

41
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,625
He loves his peas, ol' Gussie.
Big day tomorrow, boys.

42
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:29,166
You, uh… You gonna meet her at…
at the jail or…?

43
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,500
Nah, she's released today,
so we're going to Morningside.

44
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,916
What's at Morningside?

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,583
Um, it's a halfway house.
It's run by nuns.

46
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,666
Right. Do you need,
uh, money for the bus and stuff?

47
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,625
No, no, we're fine.

48
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,125
We made a few hundred
washing windscreens, so…

49
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,291
- Okay. Good.
- Yeah.

50
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,916
A couple hundred bucks washing screens?

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,375
You won't need all that for the bus.
Cough it up.

52
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,791
Forget about it. You got your own money.

53
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,250
Pfft!

54
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,166
- Try this one?
- Yeah.

55
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:03,791
-G'day.
-Hi.

56
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,791
Could I grab
the Quality Selection chocolates, please?

57
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,583
- Thanks.
- What did youse do? Rob a bank?

58
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,166
Uh, retired drug dealers, actually.

59
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:23,708
If you keep combin' your hair, you'll go
bald and she won't recognize you.

60
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,125
That's our bus. Oi! Oi!

61
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,708
Are you excited?

62
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,625
Yeah, yeah. Just a bit nervous,
to be honest.

63
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,375
What about?

64
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:47,083
You know, it's… it's been a while.
Slim always said prison changes you.

65
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,291
-Changes you how? She's still our mum.
-Yeah, I know. It's just…

66
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,666
You know, we've changed too.

67
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,500
She still loves us.

68
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,875
You're gonna be an artist
and you're a charity hero.

69
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,458
I'm gonna be a journalist.

70
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,958
We'll buy the dream home
and we'll be a family again, remember?

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,833
What?

72
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,791
Nothing, it's just…

73
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,125
Can you just lighten up a bit
and enjoy it?

74
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,666
Yeah. Yeah.

75
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,041
- Cheers, mate.
- Thanks.

76
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,666
Um…

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,125
-Uh, it's this one, isn't it?
-Nah, I think it's this one.

78
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,208
I might grab one of these flowers.
What do you reckon?

79
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:40,750
Yeah, why not?

80
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,000
-Yes?
-Hi, I'm Eli, this is Gus.

81
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,833
-We're here to see Frances Bell.
-Yes. Yes! She's expecting you.

82
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,166
Flowers, hey? How lovely.

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,125
Okay, boys. Fourth door on your right.

84
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:06,875
Thanks.

85
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,583
Come in.

86
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:32,833
Wow.

87
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,083
You boys have gotten so big.

88
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,333
Hey, Mum.

89
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,583
Group hug?

90
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,791
Mum, I missed you.

91
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,458
Was it horrible?

92
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,166
That's kind of the whole point of prison.

93
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,166
But there were some good times.

94
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,875
Playing pranks on the screws.

95
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,750
All of us sorting out
our shitty lives together.

96
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:12,125
But you wanna know
what the absolutely best bit of all was?

97
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,916
What was the best bit of all?

98
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:19,916
When this crazy kid from Darra
broke in to see his mum one Christmas day.

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,875
They still talk about that kid
all the time.

100
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,291
Serious question, Mum.

101
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,291
Hmm?

102
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,416
Where do you wanna move to next
after here?

103
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,791
Well, I have an idea, actually.

104
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,166
We got a few ideas ourselves.

105
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,375
Go on. You first.

106
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:53,458
Well, suppose that we'd saved up enough

107
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,708
for a deposit for a place in The Gap.

108
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,125
The Gap?

109
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,416
Where would you ever get
that kind of money?

110
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,875
Well, suppose that we did.

111
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,791
Big front lawn with trees,
and a big backyard, and…

112
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,375
…you could sit outside
having Campari.

113
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,500
That's very sweet of you, Eli, really.

114
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,791
Firstly, I don't…
I don't drink Campari anymore,

115
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,291
and secondly, I've…
I've got a better idea,

116
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,208
and it's all fixed.

117
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,875
What's fixed?

118
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,041
I'm moving in with Teddy Kallas.

119
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,708
What? Wh-- Why?

120
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,250
Why?

121
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,958
Uh…

122
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,166
I don't… Um…

123
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,750
Don't know, I suppose I've…
I've fallen in love with him.

124
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,708
You know that he ratted out Lyle, right?
Ratted him out to Ivan.

125
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,208
It--

126
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,416
-Did Darren Dang tell you that?
-Yeah, he did, actually.

127
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,041
That's not what happened.

128
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,208
Teddy had nothing to do with it
and that's the truth of it.

129
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:19,541
Teddy was really good to me
all that time that I was in prison.

130
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,833
You know what?
Fuck Teddy and fuck this shit!

131
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:25,875
Fuck.

132
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,583
For $2,000, which fruit is used
to describe a complete disaster?

133
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,833
Pear-shaped.

134
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,625
- Pear. That would be pear.
- Correct.

135
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,541
It's a close game. We'll be right back
after this short break.

136
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,916
-We can't touch that money. It's for Mum.
-But she doesn't want it.

137
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
-She could buy a car.
-She got Teddy's car.

138
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,000
-What will you spend 50 grand on?
-I don't fuckin' know. Stuff.

139
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,791
You don't think
anyone's gonna fuckin' notice?

140
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,625
I'm not just talkin' about the cops.

141
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,958

I'm Detective Tim Cotton.
Anyone sitting here?

148
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,583
- Yeah, the seat's taken, actually.
- Won't stay long.

149
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,875
I just wanted to offer my congratulations.

150
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:54,875
On what?

151
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,333
Your mum gettin' outta prison.

152
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,041
It's always a pleasure to see a-- a family
gettin' back onto the straight and narrow.

153
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,375
As long as they can stay there.

154
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:09,958
That's the big risk, isn't it,
with a family such as yours?

155
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:13,583
Once you've experienced
the rewards of life on the dark side…

156
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,125
You know that better than most.

157
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,416

158
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,583
I mean, you're friends with Ivan Kroll,
aren't ya?

159
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,416
Saw you and him at a party
a few years ago with Tytus Broz.

160
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,875
I'm sure you know
what happened to my stepfather.

161
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,166
This is precisely what I'm talking about.
Failure to let go of the past.

162
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,750
Flirting with real danger.

163
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,416
A sense of injury.

164
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,000
Let it all go, mate.

165
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,916
Let it go. You'll thank me for it.

00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,291
Come on, Shells.

175
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,625
Time for your physio.

176
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,083
How else are you gonna get better?

177
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,583
That's not how
muscular dystrophy works, Mum.

178
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,708
Never say never.

179
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,750
Up you pop, quick sticks.

180
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,375
I'm not three years old.

181
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,083
-Oh. Are you ready?
-Yeah.

182
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,208
Okay.

183
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,291
Oh…

184
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,458
Gus said he'd come in the afternoon,
watch the cricket and stuff with you.

185
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,000
Whoop-de-fuckin'-do.

186
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,625
Shelly, I know
you are doing it tough here,

187
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,083
and things are pretty bleak,

188
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,291
but if you won't make
an effort for yourself,

189
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,541
just do it for me, right?

190
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,625
Don't deny me
the right to hold on to hope.

191
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,333
'Cause right now, that's just
about all I've got goin' for me.

192
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,291
Okay, take a chill pill, geez.

193
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,666
Teddy's offering us all a home, Eli.

194
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,250
Tell me a better option.

195
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,250
You could always come stay at Dad's.

196
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,875
You know that could never work.

197
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,166
Thank you.

198
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:23,958
Robert's a…

199
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,958
Robert's a troubled man,
but you've seen him when he's blind drunk

200
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,875
and that is not a household
that you wanna grow up in.

201
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,125
We already grew up in it.

202
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:37,916
Teddy loved Lyle,
and he just wants to help, Eli.

203
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,500
And if you're looking for work,
there's a tutor on my psych course

204
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:46,291
who has a nephew who works
as a groundsman at The Courier-Mail.

205
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,416
Roundsman?

206
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,875
Right, well, she said
that they're often looking for cadets

207
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,875
and you should talk
to the editor-in-chief.

208
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,416
And I wrote his name down.

209
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,458
-Why don't you give him a call?
-It's not that easy, Mum.

210
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:03,333
Okay, so go in and ask to see him.
Two minutes is all you'll need with him.

211
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,291
-I don't need a job, it's fine.
-Oh come on.

212
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,666
Everyone needs a job, Eli.

213
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,500
I have to go now.

214
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,666
Are you serious? He's already here?

215
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,208
Please.

216
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,750
We could be a family again.

217
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,208
You know, it would be so lovely.

218
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,333
- Hey.
- Hey.

219
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,875
Hey, uh, big fella. Long time no see, huh?

220
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,000
-Yeah, right.
-I was just telling Eli about your offer.

221
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,708
- Hmm?
- About the boys staying with us.

222
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,375
Oh, sure. Yeah. Why not?

223
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,958
We could clear out that spare room,

224
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,125
chuck a couple beds in there
for you and Gussie.

225
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,625
Plus, whenever I'm not there,
you and your mother,

226
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,458
you basically have
the place to yourselves. Hey?

227
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,125
You could keep an eye on her for me, huh?

228
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,875
Just have a think about it.
Come on, let's go.

229
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,125
Think about it.

230
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,291
Australia struggling
for a result here

231
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,333
on the last day of this test.

232
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,916
And hope to make a return
to the dominance shown

233
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,458
in these highlights of previous days.

234
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,250
Very good catch that was
there by Richie Richardson.

235
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,416
-How are we doin'?
-Shithouse.

236
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,375
…from, uh, everybody.

237
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,875
And, uh, Geoff Marsh knows…

238
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,833
He's got that one away.

239
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:06,541
Hey, um, Mum says hi. She wants us
to come and stay with Teddy for a bit.

240
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,125
Fuck!

241
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,041
Does Teddy eat lamb shanks?

242
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,791
The fuck are you talkin' about?

243
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,166
Well played.
Warriors, our guys.

244
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,083
That was a magnificent shot.

245
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,875
So what've you been doin' today?

246
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,083
Charity stuff.

247
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,916
And that's his over.
Just come off the edge after the…

248
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,208
Do you want a cuppa?

249
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,750
Hi, Dad. How's your book?

250
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,166
Hmm? Yeah, good. Yep. Mm.

251
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,625
- Do you want a cuppa?
- I'd love one, Eli, but the milk is sour.

252
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,875
Lady Luck came calling today
on one very special family

253
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:52,750
-in Brisbane's southwestern suburbs.
-Mm. Ah, but the beer's not.

254
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,500
Single mom, Tessa Huffman,

255
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:58,000
has been hoping
to raise the $70,000 needed

256
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:02,666
to make life easier for daughter Shelly,
who is living with muscular dystrophy.

257
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,375
Over the past four years,

258
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:08,000
the school had raised
a little over $15,000.

259
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,541
But this morning, an unexpected miracle.

260
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,583
I'm here with Tessa
and Shelly Huffman who have

261
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,166
an incredible story to tell.

262
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,166
Tessa, tell us,
how did you discover the money?

263
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,041
I went to the door to get the paper and…

264
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,416
there it was,
you know, this-- this package.

265
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,833
-And we didn't know what was in it.
-You didn't?

266
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,250
You fuckin' bastard.
You gave away my fuckin' money?

267
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,416
What the fuck?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

268
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,125
Fuckin' hell, Gus.

269
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,166
Fuck!

270
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,375
Fuck you! Fucking…

271
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,333
Boys.

272
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,333
- Boys.
- You arsehole!

273
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,458
Fuck!

274
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,041
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy.

275
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,416
- Fuckin' hell.
- Take it easy.

276
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,750
Fuckin' ruined us.

277
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,125
You've certainly ruined
my brand-new sheepskin.

278
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,125
Boys, keep it in the dojo.

279
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,125
Jesus.

280
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,875
Shelly, is there a message--

281
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,125
You would've only got us in a ton of shit.

282
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,666
I-- I couldn't take that risk.

283
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,541
Whoever you are, I love you.

284
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,750
And back to you
in the newsroom.

285
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,458
Well, if that story doesn't warm
your heart, I don't know what will.

286
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,875
- See ya.
- Hello, Courier-Mail?

287
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,791
Thanks for calling,
I'll pass on the message.

288
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,916
I'm here to see Brian Robertson.

289
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,291
-Is he expecting you?
-Uh, I wrote to him.

290
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,333
Yeah, but did you hear back?

291
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:35,750
No, I haven't.

292
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,375
What did you want
to see him about?

293
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,375
I'm here to apply for a cadetship.

294
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,125
Sorry, love,
the applications closed three months ago.

295
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,833
You'll need to come back next year.

296
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,083
- But--
- What?

297
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,500
Well, it's just
that I really need this, so…

298
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,333
I remember you.
You're that kid with the bandage

299
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,125
who stopped what's-his-name
from running into the doors.

300
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,125
So?

301
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,500
Look, there's no way
I'm sending you in there.

302
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:06,083
But I can't stop you from hanging around
in the parking lot at 8:00 p.m. tonight.

303
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,208
Well, what happens at 8:00?

304
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:11,375
That's usually when the boss
knocks off, but don't tell him I told you.

305
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,875
Courier-Mail. Which department
do you require? Thank you.

306
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:19,416
Uh, sorry, just one more thing.
Where does he park?

307
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,750
-You applying to be a journalist?
-Ideally.

308
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,875
Well, you could start
by investigating which parking spot

309
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,625
has the editor's name on it.

310
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,875
Mr. Robertson?

311
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,625
Yes, what?

312
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,041
I'm Eli Bell. I just have
a couple of questions for you--

313
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:06,416
Let me go first. Where the hell
did you get that fuckin' awful tie?

314
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,833
Oh, my dad got it for me. He reckoned
it would appeal to your love of words.

315
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:11,958
Do I know your dad?

316
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,583
Um, don't think so.

317
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:18,208
Nah, 'cause he clearly doesn't know me.
I hate words. Words haunt my dreams.

318
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:22,125
-Maybe you could use me, then.
-For what? Clearly not fashion advice.

319
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,958
-For one of your cadetships, maybe.
-Maybe next year.

320
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:28,000
-You're not hiring till November, but--
-But what? It's February.

321
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:31,083
You're either three months late
or nine months too early.

322
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,583
I've got a story for ya.

323
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,416
All right, give it to me quick.

324
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,666
If you can't tell your story
in three words, we don't have a headline.

325
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,541
"John Lennon shot."

326
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,875
"Iraq invades Iran."

327
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,208
"Is irony dead?"

328
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,250
-Well--
-That's one.

329
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,291
-Look, it just depends on what angle--
-Sorry, kid. Come back in November.

330
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:22,875
The train on Platform One
is the Caboolture train,

331
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:26,000
running express from Bowen Hills
to Eagle Junction, and…

332
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,708
Caitlyn Spies?

333
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,416
I'm Eli Bell.

334
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,333
Wow, I, um… didn't recognize you.

335
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:45,958
Uh…

336
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,291
Can we chat another time? It's my train.

337
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,375
Doors closing…

338
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,416
Yeah, me too.

339
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,333
-You on the Caboolture line?
-Yeah, it's close enough.

340
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:01,750
-Um, do you mind if I sit?
-Yeah, go for your life.

341
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,041
So, uh, what were you downtown for?

342
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:10,166
Uh, I had a meeting with your boss
about a cadetship.

343
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,166
Ah…

344
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,750
Mm, you know you can't apply
until November, right?

345
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,333
He said.

346
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:20,041
Did he do that thing he does?
The three words.

347
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,500
He did, actually.

348
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,583
Mm-hm. Yeah,
he loves to do that to newbies.

349
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,625
I remember
when I first applied for the job,

350
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:32,541
he asked me for three words
to summarize my character.

351
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:34,958
What'd you tell him?

352
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:38,500
"Spies digs deep."

353
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:40,500
Because?

354
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:46,541
'Cause I've always needed
to get to the bottom of things.

355
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:50,125
Why is that?

356
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:51,791
Well, uh…

357
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,541
My mum died when I was eight,

358
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:00,958
and I guess that leaves you
with a lot of questions.

359
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:05,458
What happened? Who was responsible?

360
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,625
If there is a God out there,
why her, of all people,

361
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:13,250
with so many evil shitheads
running around free in the world?

362
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,750
That time at the newspaper,

363
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:25,041
you were gonna tell me
about your stepdad, but, um, you ran off.

364
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:30,666
Afterwards, the cops kept saying
it was all under investigation.

365
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,041
You wrote about it once.

366
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:34,416
It's where certain cops
protect certain crims,

367
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,125
and those crims keep
the drug dealers in line for the cops.

368
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:39,041
Everyone takes a cut of the profits.

369
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,791
Who was the crim who killed your stepdad?

370
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:49,333
Look, my, um… my mum just got outta jail,

371
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:52,041
and she just wants stability
and security at the moment.

372
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:54,583
The last thing I wanna do
is stir up all that shit again.

373
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,666
Sometimes I think it's good
to stir up shit.

374
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,041
Not in my experience.

375
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:05,458
Sometimes, it's best to let it all go.

376
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:11,708
If you want answers,
I'd go and talk to Bich Dang.

377
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:16,583
She's pretty unwell, but she knows
probably where all the bodies are,

378
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:17,625
and everything.

379
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:23,166
Just don't mention my name, maybe.

380
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,500
Okay.

381
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,250
Eagle Junction.
Passengers for the Shorncliffe…

382
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,791
Uh, this is my stop.

383
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:32,750
…please change trains here.

384
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:40,250
You don't live
anywhere near Caboolture, do you?

385
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,208
Um, Darra.

386
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:44,791
It's all right, I'll just take this
to Northgate and change there.

387
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:46,125
Right.

388
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:49,291
Look.

389
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:54,458
One piece of advice,
if you wanna write for the paper,

390
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:56,625
just write for the paper.

391
00:26:57,291 --> 00:27:01,375
Write something so bloody earth-shattering
they'd be mad not to run it.

392
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,166
Okay. I'll think about it.

393
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:19,833
Dear Alex. I hope
your parole came good this time.

394
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:23,541
Turns out it's been tough
getting a start as a journalist,

395
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:25,458
but I've been getting some good advice.

396
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:30,583
Anyway, Mom wants us to go
and stay with her and Teddy for a week.

397
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:33,083
Dad reckons we should do it for her sake.

398
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:35,166
Long time no see, Gussie.

399
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,625
Hey. How are you, mate?

400
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:38,541
Eli.

401
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:42,666
What do you think? Hey?

402
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,958
Well, come on.

403
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:46,708
Bring your bags, bring 'em up inside
and then I'll take you out back.

404
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:50,833
There's somethin' I wanna show you.
You are gonna love this. Whoa. Easy. Okay.

405
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:55,833
Hey, Mum. How you goin'?

406
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:56,791
Be nice.

407
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:01,208
Here's the living room.

408
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:04,625
Plenty of kung fu movies.
Hey, Gussie?

409
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:08,083
We thought that this
could be your room, boys.

410
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:11,166
Gets beautiful light in the morning,
doesn't it?

411
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,083
Yeah.

412
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:14,666
Well, go on. Drop your bags.

413
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:18,791
This… and these, these were my mum's.

414
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:23,541
Probably worth a bomb by now.
Yeah, very special. Very special.

415
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,583
All right, come on. I wanna show you
somethin' outside. Let's go.

416
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:30,666
This, uh-- This is the shower.
You'll be needin' that.

417
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,250
This is the kitchen.
We won't be needin' that.

418
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:35,291
Am I right, lads?

419
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:37,708
And these are my babies.

420
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:41,833
We have Bow and--
And there she is, there's Arrow.

421
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:43,666
Do you get it? Hey? Like the…

422
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:48,750
Ah! Hey. Hello, hello, how are you doing?
What do you think, huh?

423
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:53,833
Here we go, okay.
All right, now. Come around. Now…

424
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:58,875
And what do you think of that?

425
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:02,458
Hmm?

426
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,791
That's a Kenworth K100 conventional.

427
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:09,000
Come on. We can jump up.

428
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:12,416
Gussie, you go around the side, yeah?
Just be careful with the door, mate.

429
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,875
Could be a bit sticky, yeah?

430
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:19,375
What do you reckon, boys? Hey?

431
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:23,333
I've got air con, CB radio… It's--
Eli, come on. Come and have a…

432
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:24,708
Nah, I'm good.

433
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:28,500
All right, suit yourself. Check this out.

434
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,125
Hey there, Marlon.

435
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,791
This is Teddy Kallas. Mate, you there?

436
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:41,208
Anyone? Fitz?
Anybody got their ears on? Oi.

437
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:46,583
You know, when I can't raise
someone on the-- on the CB,

438
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:49,083
I'll, uh-- I'll talk to Lyle, sometimes.

439
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:54,791
-Yeah. Just, like, just in my imagination.
-Yeah, what do you talk to him about?

440
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:59,458
Just, uh, ya know,
times when we were together, ya know?

441
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:01,500
When we were kids.

442
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:08,875
Well,
he's the best friend I ever had.

443
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:20,500
Mrs. Dang? Uh, my name's Caitlyn Spies.

444
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:24,041
I wonder if I could ask you
a couple of questions.

445
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:29,916
Did you ever know
someone called Lyle Orlik?

446
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:33,125
I know you.

447
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,041
You're that newspaper reporter.

448
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:41,083
This-- This is not safe for me.

449
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,416
Who else know you're here?

450
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:47,750
-No one.
-Bullshit.

451
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,541
They all try to kill me.

452
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:52,916
Who is?

453
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,958
Everybody.

454
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:01,916
- I'm sure that's not true.
- True!

455
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:05,833
I know too much now.

456
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:09,583
Well, maybe you could share it with me.

457
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:14,916
I know how journalists work.

458
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,708
You get paid for the story

459
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:21,375
and some poor fool,
they suffer the consequence.

460
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:27,041
What do you care?
You're worse than the drug dealer.

461
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:30,541
Look, I just need
to know about Lyle Orlik.

462
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:33,166
You don't need to know anything.

463
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,291
I'm not talking.

464
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:41,041
Okay.

465
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,375
Okay, well…

466
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,500
if you change your mind.

467
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:07,833
If you hear from me,
I probably be dead already.

468
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:31,666
So? What did you lads think of Rain Man?

469
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,833
Yeah, it was good.

470
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,458
You reckon your brother could do
any of that stupid brainy stuff?

471
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,916
Like, if I showed him
a bunch of toothpicks,

472
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,750
do you reckon he'd be able to tell me
exactly how many there was?

473
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:46,833
He's not autistic, Teddy.
He just doesn't talk much.

474
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:48,875
It's the same difference, isn't it?

475
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:51,458
He got the top marks in school
and could've gone to uni easily.

476
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:55,750
Yeah, but wouldn't the uni people want him
to say something every now and again?

477
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,208
He does talk sometimes, don't you?

478
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,291
So why don't he speak to me, then?

479
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:03,541
Ah-ah, Gussie.

480
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:05,958
Care to comment?

481
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:13,583
-'Cause he thinks you ratted on Lyle.
-Eli!

482
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:15,625
Uh…

483
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,750
Ah, that's okay. I don't even know
what he's talkin' about.

484
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:25,333
So what are you talkin' about?

485
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:29,458
You dobbed on our stepdad to Ivan Kroll
so you could get off with our mum.

486
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:31,083
Eli, that is enough!

487
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:26,250
You really shouldn't have said that, Eli.

488
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:28,541
How do you know it's not true?

489
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:31,583
I already explained it to you.

490
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:35,625
Now, go inside and apologize.

491
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:40,125
He didn't mean anything by it.

492
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:43,916
Yes, he did! You heard him.
I heard him. Everybody heard him.

493
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,333
Everybody in the fuckin' street
basically heard him.

494
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:49,208
I mean, that doesn't make me a rat!
I never ratted on Lyle.

495
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:51,291
Look at me. I never ratted on Lyle.

496
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:56,166
He was cutting the gear, and somebody's
obviously fuckin' dobbed on him.

497
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,208
- And that's it. But how is that my fault?
- I know, I'll explain--

498
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,833
You know, you'll explain to him?

499
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm not having people
under this fucking roof,

500
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:07,125
my fuckin' parents' roof,
accusing me of bullshit.

501
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:10,500
I fuckin' ratted out my best mate?
Really, that's the best we can do?

502
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:12,916
I've got a fuckin' theory.
I've got a theory!

503
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,583
Santa Claus fuckin' did it.

504
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,458
Morning, sleepyhead.

505
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:25,083
-Where are you going?
-Out.

506
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:28,500
I'm gonna make lamb shanks for dinner.
Your favorite.

507
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,125
If you can be back by six.

508
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,708
If you're lucky.

509
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:43,166
Morning.

510
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:55,375
So, should we eat?

511
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:58,125
Just give him a few more minutes.

512
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:30,916

514
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:59,041
You indulged him.

515
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,875
All this no-speaking bullshit,
you've made him as crazy

516
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,166

517

Just eat your dinner, Teddy.

518
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:10,125
If he can answer for himself,
why doesn't he, Frankie?

519
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:15,000
If you can answer for yourself,
why don't you, Gus?

520
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:18,166
And who would wanna live
with the bloke who tried to kill ya

521
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:21,000
by driving into a fucking dam?

522
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:24,958
Dad was having a panic attack.

523
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:28,250
-He didn't know what he was doing.
-Hey, Eli, he's a fucking liar.

What's left to fight for?

685
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:17,583
Tytus thought
you'd see it that way.

686
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,083
You know, it's crazy,
the research he doing.

687
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,208
Wouldn't know. We're not scientists.

688
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:38,625
Him neither.

689
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:49,666
You can go now.

690
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:55,458
I'll stay a moment.

691
00:49:57,375 --> 00:49:58,541
Just to be sure.

692
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:04,666
There you go.

693
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,541
There was a message on your answerphone.
"Tidying up, as discussed."

694
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:50,625
Ah.

695
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:52,541
Thank you, Sophie.

696
00:50:56,666 --> 00:50:59,000
He says, for the sake
of our economic coexistence

697
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:00,125
with Northeast Asia,

698
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:03,541
industry protection must be abolished
in the next decade.

699
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:07,041
In breaking news,
colorful Brisbane identity, Bich Dang,

700
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:09,625
has been found dead
at her Brunswick Heads nursing home,

701
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:12,083
apparently of natural causes.

702
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:14,833
Police say there are
no suspicious circumstances.

703
00:51:14,916 --> 00:51:15,916
Have another one.

704
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,750
Thanks, Mrs. Bell.
