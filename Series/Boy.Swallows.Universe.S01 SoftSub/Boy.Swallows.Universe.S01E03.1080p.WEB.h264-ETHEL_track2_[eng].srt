1
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,000
Eli, mate.

2
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,250
Eli?

3
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,333
Eli?

4
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,041
Eli.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,000
Can you hear me, mate?

6
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,750
Just gonna pop this oxygen on.

7
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,125
Take some deep breaths for me.

8
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,416
You're gonna feel
something a bit cold.

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,750

00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,166

14
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,041
Welcome back to the real world, mate.

15
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,041
How you travelin'?

16
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,375
Water.

17
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,125
Water.

18
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,416
Where am I?

19
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,541
Royal Brisbane.

20
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,500
-Could they put my finger back on?
-Sorry, mate.

21
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,791
Apparently, that wasn't possible.

22
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,500
Where's my mum?

23
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,375
Police took her for questioning.

24
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,708
If you were worried
about your son's continued good health…

25
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:02,833
What about Lyle?

26
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,583
Forget about Lyle.
It's your mum you gotta worry about now.

27
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,291
She's probably gonna go to prison.

28
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,291
What for? For how long?

29
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,916
Dealing and possession,
four to five years.

30
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,666
No, it-- She didn't do anything.
That was Lyle and me.

31
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,583
Yeah, well, that's not what she's sayin'.

32
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,458
Mum did nothing, it's me
who should get the prison sentence.

33
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,708
Careful what you wish for.

34
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,875
What about the blokes who took Lyle?

35
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:36,500
I dunno anything about that,
and my advice to you is you don't either.

36
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,041
-I'll tell 'em everything--
-Eli!

37
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,875
I'll tell them Bich Dang supplies
the whole town with heroin

38
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,083
and pays off the cops.

39
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,708
Shut your fuckin' voice!

40
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,083
-I'll tell--
-Keep your voice down. Shut it.

41
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,625
…how Ivan dragged Lyle away
and chopped off my finger.

42
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,833
That's not the story your mum told 'em.

43
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,916
What did she tell them?

44
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:57,208
She said you and Gus
were horsing around with Star Wars figures

45
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,375
and decided to cut
Darth Vader in half with an ax.

46
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,375
And then Gus took a swing,

47
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,791
cut off your finger,

48
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,291
your mum fainted with shock,
and banged her head.

49
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,375
Jesus, Slim.

50
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,166
Yeah, well, that's her story
and she's stickin' to it.

51
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,250
Why?

52
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:16,416
I guess to protect you,
and now you gotta protect her.

53
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,708
Sign here.

54
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,416
Bad things happen to people
who talk about you-know-who.

55
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,041
Not just to you,
but to the people that you love.

56
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:30,458
No, no, no, no, this is wrong.
We should definitely tell someone.

57
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,875
Yeah, and who are we gonna tell, eh?
The police are in on it, mate.

58
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,041
Well, you care what happens
to Lyle, don't you?

59
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,166
'Course I do.

60
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,916
But I care more about what happens to you,
and Gus, and your mum.

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,208
I'll tell you this…

62
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,958
Somebody call the cops!

63
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,458
Whatever Lyle's got into,

64
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,250
the last thing he wants
is for you to be in there with him.

65
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:51,083
And the best way you can help Lyle
is to say nothin'.

66
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,791
Any minute now, a lady'll come in here,
a Dr. Brennan.

67
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,500
She'll ask you for your story.

68
00:04:56,583 --> 00:05:00,458
So quick-smart, you gotta make up
your mind what you're gonna tell her.

69
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,416
You make the wrong decision,
it's not just Lyle you'll lose,

70
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,125
it's Gus and your mum, all in one shot.

71
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,958
The card's upside down.

72
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,125
Now,
just because your mum is in prison,

73
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,708
doesn't mean they can't get to her,
you know what I'm sayin'?

74
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,541
Now, you told me you wanted
to be a good person.

75
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,916
This is a test.

76
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,291
No test is worth anything
unless it's difficult to pass.

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,416
And this is yours.

78
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,500
Where's Gus? I wanna speak to Gus.

79
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,958
Yeah, well, he's at Robert's.

80
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,291
Robert's? What's he doing there?

81
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,791
He's your father.
That's where you belong, the pair of you.

82
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,958
Fuck that!
We haven't spoken to the bloke in years!

83
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,583
- Eli!
- Who says we have to stay there?

84
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,875
Will you do as you're told for once?

85
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,125
That doesn't sound good.
You wanna get that cough seen to.

86
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:56,083
No. No, you doctors will, uh, just try
and stop me from dyin'.

87
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,333
Name's Halliday, friend of the family.

88
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,250
Okay. So has Eli got a place to go now
for when we discharge him?

89
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,125
- No.
- He's staying at his dad's place.

90
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:06,875
Do I get a choice?

91
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,000
Good lad. Okay, now…

92
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,833
You got some clothes in here.

93
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,916
Twenty dollars for a taxi.

94
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,708
And this letter came for you,
from your mate at Boggo Road.

95
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:22,416
Now, you wanna get in touch with me,
you ring Gill at the bottle shop.

96
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,458
You say you got a message for Slim.

97
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,125
Right?

98
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,583
Okay.

99
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:32,875
Okay.

100
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,875
-Slim Halliday, that's not the--
-What?

101
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,541
-The taxi driver killer?
-He didn't kill that bloke.

102
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:48,458
Okay, well, anyway, you… you tell him
that he needs to get a chest X-ray.

103
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:54,375
Okay…
…let's have a look at this hand of yours.

104
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,791
I hear you lost your special finger.

105
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,541
All right, let's see
how that wound is healing up, huh?

106
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,291
Why can't they
just sew it back on?

107
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,416
Well, it's complicated.

108
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,125
The nerves are really hard to reattach,

109
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,500
and even if you can get them to grow back,

110
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,166
your finger tends to stiffen up

111
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,375
while it's waiting around
to be reconnected.

112
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,875
Well, you just end up
with this useless, numb, hooky thing,

113
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,916
catches on your clothes, gets in the way.

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,333
I mean, to be honest,
you're better off without it.

115
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,500
That's a nice clean cut.

116
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,416
Must've been a heck of a sharp ax.

117
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,041
Uh, we're busy in here, Christopher.
What do you want?

118
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,458
Tang's too weak again.

119
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,583
That's impossible.
I doubled the strength yesterday.

120
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,875
It's still too weak! I'm fuckin' dying
and you're givin' me weak Tang?

121
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,666
Just… just go away, Christopher,

122
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,083
and close the curtain,
and I will come and see you later.

123
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,625
-What's wrong with him?
-Brain cancer.

124
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,250
-That's shit.
-Yeah, that's what he thinks too.

125
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,333
Why can't they just operate?

126
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,041
Well, I'm not sure.

127
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,791
Want to see
if we can shrink his tumor first.

128
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:12,791
All right…

129
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,208
…so you were saying?

130
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:22,250
About this accident with the ax
when your brother cut off your finger.

131
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,625
Well, we decided

132
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:30,666
to, um, execute Darth Vader
to pay him back

133
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,125
for killing Obi-Wan Kenobi.

134
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,541
What? No. You think Obi-Wan Kenobi's dead?

135
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:39,250
Well, he got chopped with a lightsaber
and vanished, so…

136
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,250
Well, vanished isn't the same as dead.

137
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,208
Exactly.

138
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:49,750
All right.

139
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,750
Okay, can you show me

140
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,666
how you were holding Darth Vader?

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,041
Like that.

142
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,666
Okay, all right, and your-- your brother,

143
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:10,125
he-- he took a massive great swing
with an ax,

144
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,541
cut off your finger,
clean through that joint,

145
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,333
without damaging
any of the ones next to it?

146
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,375
I… I guess so.

147
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,375
Wow, that's a-- that's a pretty good shot.

148
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,375
Then your mum came in the kitchen
and slipped on the blood,

149
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,750
and knocked herself out?

150
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,916
If… If that's what she told the cops…

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,500
-Mm-hmm.
-…then-- then yeah.

152
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,791
What I'm asking, Eli,
is whether you wouldn't like to revise

153
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,541
the story that you just told me
in any way at all.

154
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,708
No, no, no, um, I wouldn't.

155
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,541
Okay. All right.

156
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,833
Well, look,
I'll be in to see you a little bit later,

157
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,833
and the police might be in tomorrow.

158
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,125
There's a Detective Tim Cotton
who wants to have a word with you.

159
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,333
All right, then.

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,416
Yeah, she's gonna plead guilty,
so we're all good there.

161
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,250
And all the evidence will suggest
that her partner done a runner.

162
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,875
Mm-hmm.

163
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,875
I'm gonna go pay the kid a visit tomorrow.

164
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,625
Make sure he knows to keep schtum.

165
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,625
Hi! Mornin', darlin'.

166
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,208
Your mum's
not gonna fuckin' help you now.

167
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,958
Dear Alex,
excuse the wonky handwriting.

168
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,041
Long story short,
I wound up in hospital two days ago

169
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,750
after a disagreement with an ax.

170
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,458
The doctor reckons
I'm healing really fast.

171
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,500
Maybe because it was a clean cut.

172
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,000
-Who you writing to?
-A friend of mine.

173
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,833
A friend in Boggo Road Gaol?

174
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,750
-You reckon that's a bad thing?
-What'd your pal go to jail for?

175
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,000
He was a sergeant-in-arms
for a motorcycle gang.

176
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:37,208
Right. So he's a psycho,
and he knows your address now.

177
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,041
-That's pretty dumb.
-Well, he seems friendly in his letters.

178
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,666
-If he's a biker, he's a dead-set psycho.
-Ah, and you know a lot of bikers, do you?

179
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,333
Nah, but my mum does.

180
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,833
- Dr. Brennan says you got brain cancer.
- So?

181
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,500
You gonna start writing letters
to cancer patients now, are ya?

182
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,166
Not if they're all dicks like you.

183
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,375
-I'm Christopher.
-Eli.

184
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,666
A girl's name.

185
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,333
No, it's not. My dad got it
from a book he was reading.

186
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,875
I asked them to put on Diff'rent Strokes,
but there's more little kids than big,

187
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,250
so we all watch this shit.

188
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,458
These little pricks
will spend the rest of their lives

189
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,666
watching whatever the fuck they want.

190
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,041
I'll be dead in three months

191
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,291
and can't watch Diff'rent Strokes
when I want to.

192
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,791
Three months? Seriously?

193
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,666
Unless they can operate.
So, what happened to your hand?

194
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:37,458
You want the truth?

195
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,833
Nah, I want you to bullshit me like
everyone else does in this fuckin' place.

196
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,250
Well, my stepdad's a smack dealer,

197
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,875
and the enforcer for his network

198
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,375
cut off my finger
with a bloody great hunting knife.

199
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,875
What'd he do that for?

200
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,125
Thinks my stepdad
has a secret stash somewhere.

201
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,125
Does he?

202
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,041
No idea.

203
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,541
Well, where is he now, your stepdad?

204
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,666
I dunno.

205
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,750
They, uh-- They smashed him in the face
and then they dragged him off

206
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,458
and then they, um…
knocked my mum unconscious, so…

207
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,875
Hardcore, man.

208
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,291
Yeah.

209
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,833
Yeah, I just need
to get outta here quick-smart

210
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,750
and do a deal with these kidnappers.

211
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,250
- You're not shitting me, are you?
- Why would I be?

212
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,916
You're just some psycho
who'll be dead in three months.

213
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,375
How you plannin' to get out?

214
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,000
I'll wait for the tea trolley,
they'll be here at 3:00,

215
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,291
and make a distraction
while the doors are unlocked.

216
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,625
What kind of distraction?

217
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,666
Well, when my mate Slim was tryin'
to get out of Boggo Road Gaol,

218
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,083
he set fire to a big heap
of mattress fibers to distract the guards.

219
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,541
His plan was to go through the roof
and over the wall.

220
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,750
Did it work?

221
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,750
Get off me, you motherfucker!
Get off me!

222
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,833
No, not that time,
but he got bloody close.

223
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,916

Forensics have been
all over your house like a rash,

so breaking and entering's
probably not your best option.

260
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,791
Oh, hi, Gene.

261
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,541
Just need to get something from inside.

262
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:45,083
That was some carry-on the other night.

263
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,083
What happened?

264
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,791
Well, me and Gus decided to chop
an action figure in half with an ax,

265
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,500
and he got my finger instead.

266
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,166
Right.

267
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,750
'Cause when I looked out the window,

268
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:06,291
I… I saw Lyle being dragged off
by two blokes into the boot of a car.

269
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,500
You tell the cops that?

270
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,583
-Too right I did.
-And what did they say?

271
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,500
They told me to keep quiet about it
for my own safety.

272
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,750
Yeah, that figures.

273
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,666
Any word of Lyle?

274
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,791
No, but I'm gonna find him
before anything bad happens to him.

275
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,583
I reckon you're too late for that, matey.

276
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,041
Yeah.

277
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:35,125
But he did once give me this,
uh, back door key to look after.

278
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,250
"For a rainy day," he said.

279
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,750
-But it's not raining.
-Mate…

280
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,791
From what I've seen,
it's bloody well pissin' down.

281
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,666
I never saw you, all right?

282
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:53,833
Thanks, Gene.

283
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,750
Lyle!

284
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,083
Mum!

285
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,416
No.

286
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,500
No! No! No! No! No!

287
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,375
Who is this?

288
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,041
What are you doing there?

289
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,125
-I'm looking for Lyle's secret stash.
-How do you know Lyle's got a stash?

290
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,291
Well, Ivan Kroll thought he did.

291
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,291
That's why he cut off my fucking finger,

292
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,083
'cause he wants everyone
to be scared shitless of him.

293
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:44,333
Which is why none of the adults will help,
and I don't even know where to find Lyle.

294
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,583
And I don't even know who I'm speaking to!

295
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:50,916
Suppose you did find Lyle's stash,
what are you gonna do with it?

296
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:55,541
I'm gonna offer it to Ivan Kroll,
if he'd let Lyle go free.

297
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,416
So, who would you talk to to find Ivan?

298
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,583
-I don't know. The cops?
-Think harder.

299
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,125
Maybe Bich Dang?

300
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,916
-Stay safe, Eli.
-Wait. No! No! No!

301
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,916
Wait! Wait! Wait! Come on--

302
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,083
Hello, who is it?

303
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,208
Is Bich there?

304
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,833
It's Eli Bell, uh, a friend of Darren's.

305
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:54,541
One moment, please.

306
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,916
-Hello.
-Hi.

307
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Shoes.

308
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:08,458
Come with me.

309
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:18,208
And now here's Troy,
our favorite wheeler-dealer.

310
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:21,958
Thank you very much.
Yes, it's the Wheel of Fortune.

311
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,666
Some great prizes yet again.

312
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,291
We have some lovely contestants here,
who are going to take them all away.

313
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,958
We just love to give things a--

314
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,666
Eli Bell.

315
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,958
What do you want?

316
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:39,000
Uh, you once said that I could come back
and talk sometime.

317
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,708
-I need your help.
-You're filthy, go stand over there.

318
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,375
Why would I want to talk to you?

319
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,000
You betray me.

320
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,291
No, I didn't. How did I betray you?

321
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:55,875
You and Lyle, selling rubbish heroin,
saying it was mine.

322
00:23:55,958 --> 00:24:00,166
Bich Dang's heroin was 100% pure.

323
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,583
Now Lyle ruin my reputation.

324
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,500
Dustin Vang thinks
he can take over the market.

325
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm s-- I'm sure Lyle didn't plan that.

326
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:13,125
No one plan the Vietnam War,
but it happen.

327
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:17,791
Didn't plan for my parents' boat to sink,
but that happen too.

328
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,541
A lot of shit happen without plan.

329
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,791
-Why you still here?
-I need to speak with Ivan Kroll.

330
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:29,958
Can you contact him for me?
He came to your party.

331
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,083
Not my business.

332
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:35,458
Not yours either.
Not if you don't want to end up like Lyle.

333
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:39,333
-Wait, so what happened to Lyle?
-I don't know what happen.

334
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:43,875
You were supposed to be helping me,
but you fuck up.

335
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,791
Go home, have a bath.

336
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,000
I don't have a home.

337
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,083
Not my problem.

338
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:10,166
…car that's good for show,
it's a car that will go, go, go.

339
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,666
It handles like a dream,
what a great little machine.

340
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,083
Gus?

341
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:01,875
Hey, Eli.

342
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,958
I knew you'd show up eventually.

343
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:14,041
You're still talking.

344
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,541
That's good.

345
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:21,583
So, how long you been here at Robert's?

346
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,166
Couple days.

347
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:29,041
-So, he's in there?
-Just be careful.

348
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,625
He's just a bit unpredictable
when he's been on the piss.

349
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:36,458
-What's that horrible noise?
-That's him singing.

Are you all right, Dad?

364
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:40,000
It's-- It's me, Eli.

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,875
Dad?

366
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:44,708

Oof!

00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,416
Dad! Dad, stop it, that's Eli!

369
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:29,708
Don't worry, that's just
the double-strength beer talkin'.

370
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:35,041
He didn't know who you were.
He's quite sweet when he's sober.

371
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,583
- Help me drag him in there.
- Okay.

372
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,625
Mm…

373
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:56,125
I found an old lock under the house.

374
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:05,500
- Is there anything to eat here?
- He spends all his dole money on booze.

375
00:29:20,916 --> 00:29:22,625
I wouldn't eat anything in there.

376
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,750
-Is that mud or shit on your trousers?
-Mm? Oh, it's just mud.

377
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,875
I was in the tunnel at Sandakan Street
looking for Lyle's stash.

378
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:47,208
If we hand it over,
then they'll release him.

379
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:48,250
It's only fair.

380
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,666
I don't think
that's how the criminal mind works.

381
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,333
Lemme fix that.

382
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,250
How is your hand?

383
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,333
It's okay. Hurts a little bit.

384
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:06,791
To be honest, I think
they probably killed Lyle already.

385
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:09,750
-Dumped his body somewhere.
-Come on, Gus.

386
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:12,250
We can't just give up on Lyle like that.

387
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:15,000
He wrote something in the air
before they dragged him off.

388
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,583
What did he write to you?

389
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,666
"I love you, QSLG."

390
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:22,125
What the fuck's QSLG?

391
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,958
That's just when they hit him,
the letters went all wobbly.

392
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:30,208
I'm sorry, Eli.

393
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,750
Wanna see the rest of the place?
I'll show you around.

394
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:41,541
Sure.

395
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:54,958
This is his library.

396
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:59,833
He said he's read 'em all,
which is not impossible,

397
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:03,875
considering all he does all day
is read and drink

398
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:05,458
and watch Sale of the Century.

399
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:18,750
I remember this one.

400
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:45,875
We don't have any blankets,
but you can have this coat.

401
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:58,833
I'm gonna ring the limbs factory,
'cause if they fixed up Ivan Kroll's face,

402
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:01,291
then they'd have to know
where he lives, right?

403
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:06,250
I say we speak to Slim first.

404
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,458
See if he'd let us
stay with him for a bit.

405
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:11,000
-What do you reckon?
-All right.

406
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,250

Hey. Eli, Gus. What are you doin' here?

433
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:04,541
Eli reckons we should find Ivan Kroll
and do a deal with him.

434
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:07,833
Well, there's no way you're doin' that,
and I've already told you the reason why.

435
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,791
Good to see you got your voice back.

436
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:15,166
-Been to see your mum in prison yet?
-No. Not yet.

437
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,750
We need a responsible adult to take us.

438
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,958
- Yeah, so ask Robert.
- Have you ever met him?

439
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:22,625
Robert is a useless alco
and his place is a shithole.

440
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,291
You're not stoppin' here,
if that's your plan.

441
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:27,333
Why not?
Thought you were our friend, Slim.

442
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:30,458
I am. But you stay here,
they'll catch you and put you in care,

443
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:33,125
like me when I was a young nipper.
You can see how that worked out.

444
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,500
Well, what if we just hide out here until…

445
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:39,750
Until what? They're gonna get ya.

446
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:44,083
You're talking about a serious crim,
corrupt cops, the education department.

447
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:46,416
And they know everything,
they're fuckin' relentless.

448
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:49,291
-What's wrong with Robert's place?
-Everything.

449
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,291
To be honest, he's pretty unstable.

450
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,416
I mean, he thought Eli was a burglar
and attacked him with an ax handle.

451
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:58,916
Yeah, well, you gotta get him
off the piss, haven't you? Dry him out.

452
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,916
Sit down. I'll make you up some damper
and some tea and drive you back to town.

453
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,916
Fuck that, we'll manage ourselves.
Come on, Gus, let's go.

454
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:07,458
Eli.

455
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:11,291
Mate, don't get your knickers in a twist.
I'm just trying to be practical.

456
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:12,416
You're being a coward.

457
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,583
I'm tryin' to tell you
how the system works.

458
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:18,666
You go on like this, your mum won't see
the light of day, and you won't either.

459
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,500
And the pair of you,
you're gonna end up in care,

460
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:23,416
and I'll go on the pedo register.

461
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,791
Here, let me give you some money anyway.

462
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:29,875
Oh, keep your fucking money!
Gus, we're leaving.

463
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,583
Mate, now you're talking,
see if you can talk some sense into him.

464
00:37:35,666 --> 00:37:37,208
I'm goin' to the newspaper.

465
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:39,916
I'm gonna tell Caitlyn Spies
what really happened.

466
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,166
Big mistake, mate.

467
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,625
You'll just make things worse
for everyone.

468
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:45,791
How could it be worse, Slim?

469
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:48,375
Our mother's been locked up
for something she didn't do,

470
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:52,500
and our stepdad has been kidnapped
by a murderous fucking psychopath,

471
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:55,166
the police wanna put us in juvie,

472
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,708
and our dad tried to brain me
with a fucking ax handle!

473
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:02,750
Now name one thing
that could be worse in that picture!

474
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,083
Um, hello?

475
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:44,500
Can I help you?

476
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:47,041
Um, I'm here to see Caitlyn--

477
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,166
Push the button as you speak, please.

478
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,750
I'm Eli Bell,
I'm here to see Caitlyn Spies.

479
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,500
She expecting you?

480
00:38:57,083 --> 00:39:00,416
-No, but I got a story for her.
-What kind of story?

481
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:02,208
It's a crime story.

482
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:03,708
Are you a witness?

483
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:05,333
No, I'm a victim.

484
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,541
Caitlyn is busy on a deadline
at the moment.

485
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:12,000
Do you want to leave your name and number
and she'll get back to you?

486
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:15,333
Tell her I can get her an interview
with Slim Halliday.

487
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:18,791
Hold on a sec.

488
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:23,291
Hi, Caitlyn.

489
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:26,750
Yeah, I've got an Eli Bell at the door.

490
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:30,333
He says that he can get you
an interview with Slim Halliday.

491
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:31,708
Right-o.

492
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:36,708
Come in, then, she'll be down in a minute.

493
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,666
You can just take a seat there.

494
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:47,541
Hello, Courier-Mail.

495
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:48,958
Can Brian call you back?

496
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:51,750
He's in a shareholder meeting
with Mr. Broz right now.

497
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:54,125
-Yeah. Okay.
-Just goin' on a tea break.

498
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:57,375
Right-o. Speak to you later. Bye.

499
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:25,250
Are you waiting for me?

500
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm Caitlyn.

501
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:35,166
I--

502
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,250
Yes, I… I, um…

503
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:41,208
Shall we start
with your full name?

504
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:44,000
Oh… Why do you need to know that?

505
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:47,500
'Cause I'm planning to knit a cardigan
with your initials on it.

506
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,208
Uh, it's…

507
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:52,708
Christopher.

508
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:57,125
-Brain.
-Not Eli Bell, then?

509
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:00,791
It's what you told the receptionist.

510
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,375
Yes.

511
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:06,583
-I'll go with Eli Bell, shall I?
-Can we do this anonymously?

512
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:09,625
-Why?
-There's people that I need to protect.

513
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,708
The man that I'm about to tell you about
did terrible things to people.

514
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:17,666
All right, and are these friends
of Slim Halliday?

515
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,791
No. Way worse.

516
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:23,916
Is this anything to do with your hand?

517
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Yeah, um, but to understand it properly,
I'll have to go back a few weeks.

518
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:31,458
Actually, Eli, can we cut to the chase?

519
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:34,166
A, uh, tattooed leg just washed up
on Brighton Beach.

520
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,208
Something I have to look into, but…

521
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:39,291
Are you all right?

522
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,750
What kind of tattoo?

523
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,833
- Let me in! Let me in!
- Jesus.

524
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:50,125
Oh, shit, it's Raymond Leary.
Helen, where's security?

525
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,625
He's on a break.

526
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:54,291
Mr. Leary, please step away
from the glass.

527
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:57,208
Let me in! I know Broz is in there.

528
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:59,708
-Let me in!
-Who's Raymond Leary?

529
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:02,791
He's a building contractor.
Says his client wouldn't pay him,

530
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:05,000
he went bankrupt,
then his wife got depression

531
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:07,833
and killed herself.
He wants the paper to tell his story.

532
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:09,333
Let me in!

533
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:11,375
And why won't you?

534
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:14,041
'Cause his client,
Mr. Broz, is a major shareholder

535
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:16,000
who already took out a restraining order.

536
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:17,041
Yes, police?

537
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:20,375
This is the office
of The Courier-Mail at 2 Holt Street.

538
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:22,333
There's a guy tryin'
to break the door down.

539
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:30,375
-He's gonna kill himself.
-Wait, no, no, don't let him in.

540
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,250
Mr. Leary.

541
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:38,791
Eli! Eli, get back in here.

542
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:42,458
You're not winning any friends.
Just let it go. There's no point.

543
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:45,125
-Mate?
-Get out of the way, kid.

544
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:47,125
Just go home and put it in a letter.

545
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:48,541
-There's no point.
-Eli…

546
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:50,208
Get out of the way.

547
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,791
Oh, Helen, call an ambulance.

548
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:00,500
Eli, are you okay?

549
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:04,500
Gonna write about him now?

550
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:09,458
To be honest, probably not.
He's got a bit of psychiatric history.

551
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,791
That leg you mentioned.

552
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:13,541
That was a man's leg, right?

553
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,166
With a woman's name on it.

554
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:18,666
Uh, police haven't released
the details yet.

555
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:21,708
The woman's name is Frankie.

556
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:25,916
-Right, and how would you know that?
-She's my mum.

557
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:31,500
Step aside. Everybody, stand back.

558
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:34,000
No, Eli!

559
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:39,666
Hello, Courier-Mail.

560
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:48,125
Hey, I'm sorry I ran off.

561
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:50,666
It doesn't matter.

562
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,791
Someone found a leg
that washed up off Brighton Beach,

563
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,625
and it had a name tattooed on it.

564
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:13,041
Shit.

565
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,166
Doesn't mean they murdered him.

566
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:19,500
But you're right, it probably does.

567
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,833
Eli, you still gonna talk to the papers?

568
00:44:30,916 --> 00:44:33,833
No, Slim's right.

569
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:36,958
Just gotta keep quiet and…

570
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:41,750
sort out Robert…

571
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:44,750
…before anything gets worse
than it already is.

572
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:48,416
It's just you and me, Gus.

573
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:51,916
No one's gonna help us.

574
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:07,000
- Brian?
- Yes?

575
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:09,583
I had a walk-in
off the street this afternoon,

576
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:11,416
just something I'd like to follow up on.

577
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,500
Yes, no worries.

578
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:15,875
Now, before you run off on us,
where are you with Mr. Shark Leg?

579
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:18,708
His old mate in forensics…

580
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,708
sent that through for you this afternoon.
