1
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:13,291
Letter.

2
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:22,333
Dear Alex,

3
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,541
note my temporary change of address,

4
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,250
my dad Robert's place.

5
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:29,041
Gus and I are here
because Mum is in prison.

6
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:34,583
Gus has been getting back into painting,
partly to cover up the holes in the wall,

7
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,500
but they're all pretty weird.

8
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,000
Yesterday, he did one of me with red hair

9
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:42,041
leaving the big red chicken shop
on Barrett Street.

10
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,250
He called that one Better Red than Dead.

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,666
And now he's doing the story
of how our mum met our dad.

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,250
She never did tell us what made her
leave home and run off like that.

13
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:56,291
But anyway, for some reason,
she takes off hitching up north.

14
00:00:56,875 --> 00:01:00,625
She's just outside Townsville
when some sicko bundles her into his ute

15
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:03,541
and he drives away
off into the cane fields.

16
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,666
They hit some roadworks,
so he has to slow.

17
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,875
Don't you say a fuckin' word.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,958
Fuck it!

19
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,666
And then my mum just dives out
onto the tarmac.

20
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:18,833
Fuck!

21
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,166
Hey, slow down!

22
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,500
You're all right, love.
I got you. You're okay. You're okay.

23
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,458
Christ.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,875
Thank you.

25
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:46,416
Mum stared into the deep blue eyes
of the man who'd just saved her.

26
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,041
And that bloke was Robert Bell…

27
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,083
G'day.

28
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,041
…my father.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Mm…

30
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,833
Uh…

31
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,458
Fuck it.

32
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,416
Eh…

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,875
Hello.

34
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,375
Uh…

35
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:44,750
Ah, yeah.

36
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,625
Mm-hmm.

37
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,166
Mm…

38
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:51,875
Oh fuck. Fuck.

39
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,500
Oh fuck! Fuck!

40
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:55,875
Help! Help!

41
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,708
Oh! Ow! Oh!

42
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,541
Ah! Ah-ah-ah!

43
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,333
Help! Help! Help!

44
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,750
- Dad, what the…
- Shit!

45
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,333
Ow!

46
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,416
What-- What'd you do that for?

47
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,666
-Your fucking pants were on fire.
-I took 'em off, you fuckwit.

48
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,125
Everything all right, Robert?

49
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,833
Okay, folks, show's over.

50
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,875
- Okay.
- Thank you.

51
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,541
- Come on.
- Where are my glasses?

52
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,541
Eli, where are my glasses, mate?

53
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,625
Stinks of turps in here.

54
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:44,666
What happened?

55
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,000
I was just tryin' to get a drink.

56
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,666
Maybe you should go to the pub next time.

57
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,416
Well, maybe you should stop spending
my child support on paints and shit.

58
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,541
Maybe you should
go and take us to see our mum.

59
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,333
It's called agoraphobia, Eli.

60
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:02,166
Agoraphobia. Uh? "Fear of public places
with many people in 'em,"

61
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,208
as defined by the Oxford Dictionary.

62
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,583
-You can get someone else to take ya.
-Like who?

63
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,875
Well, I dunno.
Maybe your old mate Slim Halliday.

64
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,125
Slim won't go near the place.

65
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,666
We already asked.

66
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,500
Don't answer that.
That'll be child protection.

67
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,833
And you two gotta
get your arses back to school

68
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,333
before they take you to foster care.

69
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,791
And do not give me that look, Eli Bell!

70
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:24,208
It's not my fault your bloody stepfather
got eaten by a shark.

71
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,875
Oh, I'm sorry.

72
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,250
All right, look,
I'm gonna pick up my dole this arvo,

73
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:40,291
and you can all go get us
some chicken and chips for dinner, hey?

74
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,333
Family dinner.

75
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,125
Yeah?

76
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,583
Chicken, chips. Tomorrow I'll be better.

77
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,000
Uh…

78
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,333
Sorry, mate.

79
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:14,916
Tinkerbell.

80
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,458
Is it true your brother
cut your finger off with an axe?

81
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,666
It was an accident.

82
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,708
Want us to pay him back?

83
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,458
Gotta stand up for yourself, mate,
or you never know where it'll end.

84
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,958
Next time, he might cut your dick off.

85
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:35,333
- We're starting a gang. Wanna join?
- Thought you were in Darren's gang.

86
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,875
Darren's left school
to help his mum with her business.

87
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,416
What? He's helping Bich
run the restaurant now?

88
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,041
Her other business, bellend.

89
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,583
- I dunno anything about that.
- Sure you don't.

90
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,833
I heard your mum
got three to four years for dealing.

91
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,833
How's she going at Boggo Road?
Or haven't you been yet?

92
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,125
I hear they're all lezzies
or else having to fuck the screws.

93
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,583
If you're gonna visit,
you'd want to smarten yourself up first.

94
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,833
Give your hair a good shampoo, hey.

95
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,125
-I got 'im! I got 'im! Someone help.
-No! Ah!

96
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,791
-All right, open his arms.
-Calm down, mate.

97
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,958
Oh, come on. Oh, fuck off, Bobby.

98
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,791
- Come on, guys! Come on!
- How does that feel?

99
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,000
Rub it in all over.
Nourish the roots, there you go.

100
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,875
- Nice.
- Get off me!

101
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,750
How's that feel, Eli?

102
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,000
Did you get the video?

103
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:36,875
Hey, Eli.

104
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,458
What happened?

105
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:54,916
It's just tomato sauce.
Bobby Linyette and his mates got me.

106
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,208
-Want me to do 'em over?
-No.

107
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,458
I should learn to fight my own battles.

108
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,208
Better red than dead, right?

109
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,708
It gets better.

110
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:20,666
What does?

111
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,833
This life.

112
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,250
So good you'll forget it was ever bad.

113
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:30,791
Sure.

114
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,625
How's that gonna happen?

115
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,166
It just will.

116
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,250
I've been here before.

117
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,708
What are you crapping on about, Gus?

118
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,625
We live the same life over and over.

119
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:49,250
Once you die, you go back
and do it again, same but different.

120
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,583
Slim had a different theory.

121
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,166
It's not a theory.

122
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,000
You and me died once already, remember?

123
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,208
And we came back.

124
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,416
Each time, I… I try
and picture the mistakes we made,

125
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,041
so I know how to fix 'em.

126
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,250
Comes back to me
in random bits and pieces,

127
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,833
but it's just how the future speaks to us.

128
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,166
You remember that voice
on the red telephone, right?

129
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,291
Yeah.

130
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,333
Remember how you thought
you recognized it?

131
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,750
I think that was me.

132
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,791
Speaking to you from the future.

133
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,458
Look.

134
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,583
Gus, I like it
that we're talking now, but…

135
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,041
…please, don't you
go fucking psycho on me.

136
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,041
Life's hard enough as it is.

137
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,625
Help!

138
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,875
Hey. Hey, guard!

139
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:15,000
Frankie, cut it out with these knock-ups.
What is it this time?

140
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,708
I'm still waiting
for contact with my kids.

141
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:22,166
-There's a phone. You got a phone number?
-Yeah, my ex's and he's not answering.

142
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,916
- So write to them.
- Yeah, I tried that. No reply.

143
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,958
Well, write to them again, maybe.

144
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,458
I know what's going on here.

145
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,833
Tell me. What's going on?

146
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:36,250
Fucking Tim Cotton doesn't want me
talking to my family.

147
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,875
-I've no idea what you're talkin' about.
-Ask Detective Cotton.

148
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:44,458
I just really wanna talk to my family
like everyone else does.

149
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,666
Can you tell him that? Please.

150
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,833
Frankie, love, we're just tryin'
to give everyone their lunch here.

151
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,416
Put any messages for the higher-ups
in the complaints box.

152
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,250
Do you want a taste?

153
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:35,625
No.

154
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,833
No, thank you.

155
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,833
I need time to think.

156
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,583
Well, bloody oath.

157
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,583
This is the place to do it.

158
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,250
Mm… Shit.

159
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,208
Here, have a look at that.
Look at that, boys.

160
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,916
You'll have to get your arses
back to school, quick-smart.

161
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,625
We'll go when you take us to see our mum.

162
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,750
Fine, all right.
Well, you'll get taken away from here,

163
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,541
you'll go into a foster home,

164
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,583
and then you can
grow up to be career criminals

165
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,916
like, you know,
your old mate Slim Halliday.

166
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,458
She'll think we forgot about her!

167
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,458
Look, I'm not being a prick
for shits and giggles.

168
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,458
I'm tryin' to look out for ya.

169
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,708
Don't answer that.

170
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,208
This is Lyle Orlik.

171
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:13,000
A mid-level drug dealer from Darra
who reportedly went on the run.

172
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:18,041
Now, we all know heroin importation
is dominated by gangs out of Vietnam.

173
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,333
Cutting off limbs as payback
is kind of their signature.

174
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:26,208
So you're saying Mr. Orlik
isn't actually a shark attack?

175
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:31,958
"Ragged amputation
through the knee joint, cause unknown."

176
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,250
And did we track down who Frankie is?

177
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:42,041
Frankie Bell, Lyle Orlik's de facto wife,

178
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,333
was taken into custody a while back
for dealing and possession.

179
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:49,000
She has two sons, age 13 and 15,
enrolled at Greenview State School.

180
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,958
Now, the youngest, Eli,
showed up here the other day

181
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,000
with an injured hand, said bad people
had something to do with it.

182
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,875
-What sort of bad people?
-No idea.

183
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,041
He ran off when the police showed up.

184
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,833
Tytus had just arrived for a meeting

185
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,333
and Raymond Leary was trying to headbutt
his way through the front door.

186
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:11,500
Now, the hospital recorded
Eli's hand injury as a domestic accident.

187
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,791
Said his brother did it with an axe.

188
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,333
The 15-year-old?

189
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,041
My brother knocked me out
with a garden rake once when I was 15.

190
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,083
We were tryin' to re-enact El Cid.

191
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,541
The school won't give me their whereabouts
and I'm not sure they even know.

192
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,708
Why don't you hit up your mate Tim Cotton.
Perhaps he'll give us the skinny.

193
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:31,625
He's not my mate.

194
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,583
No, but he does fancy you,
which is the next best thing.

195
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,666
Come on, don't sulk.

196
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,791
Use your talents!

197
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:43,333

211
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,416
I was looking through
some of the old revenge killings

212
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,458
going back over the last five years.

213
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,333
Mostly drug couriers, mostly unsolved.

214
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,875
Well, those interstate crimes
are tough to pin down.

215
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,208
New South Wales cops,
dodgy as all get-out.

216
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,791
What? Unlike Queensland cops?

217
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,416

Who, the shark attack guy? What about him?

221
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
His kid, Eli Bell,
showed up at the newspaper offices,

222
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,541
missing a finger.

223
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,291
Said he had a story to tell.

Did he?

225
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,875
-Well, I haven't spoken to him yet.
-Don't.

226
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,333
Our investigations are currently underway.

I can tell you, off the record,

228
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,750
that Dustin Vang
is certainly on our radar.

229
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,000
The BTK gang leader
out of Sydney?

230
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,791
So you think Lyle Orlik
was probably a drug killing.

231
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:39,375
Listen, this is all strictly under
the dome of silence, you understand?

Until we get something
that stands up in court.

00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,250
You need to stay out of this one. You do.

235
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,125
-And how long is that gonna take?
-Months.

236
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,250
-Years.
-So there goes my whole story.

237
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,208
Sorry, Caitie.

I promise you, you'll be the first to know
when we get close to a conviction.

239
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,166
Until then, it would help us

240
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:02,416
if you let this one through to the keeper,
if you're familiar with that term.

241
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,208
Mm. Sure. I get asked to do that a lot.
One of the reasons I hate fucking cricket.

242
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,125
Hello?

243
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,750
Are you expecting anyone?

244
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,875
- Hello?
- Coming.

245
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,416
Ah, hello, Miss Birkbeck.

246
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,458
Hello, Eli, is your dad at home?

247
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,625
Um…

248
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,541
Yeah, he works night shifts.

249
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,416
So he's just…
He's just sleeping right now.

250
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,750
Wake him up for us, will you?

251
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,500
All right.

252
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,666
- Dad. Dad. Dad.
- What? Fuck off.

253
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,750
Um, it's Poppy Birkbeck
with a police officer.

254
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,583
-She's got handcuffs on her belt and she--
-Who the fuck is Poppy Birkbeck?

255
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,500
She's the school headshrinker.

256
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,166
Uh… Oh…

257
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,750
Open the curtain, will ya?

258
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,583
Uh…

259
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,208
Oh…

260
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, Eli.

261
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,708
-Tell me, do you like her?
-She's all right.

262
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:42,041
I mean, she's quite nosy.
Annoying. But, yeah, she's all right.

263
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,583
Well, tell her I'll be right out
in a tick, okay?

264
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,708
-Okay.
-Okay.

265
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:48,958
He's just coming.

266
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,333
Okay.

267
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,416
I'm here. I'm here.

268
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,458
Gus.

269
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,291
Come here. Come here. Come here.

270
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:04,916
Come here. Tidy this shit up, will you?
We got visitors. Visitors.

271
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,916
Tidy this shit up, all right? Thank you.

272
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,500
Okay.

273
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,041
Hello, I'm Robert Bell.

274
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,333
Poppy Birkbeck, the school counselor.

275
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,083
Eli's been telling me

276
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:31,125
about all the wonderful counseling
that you've been giving them.

277
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:32,958
We do our best.

278
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,916
Hm…

279
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,583
Getting to know the inner child is
the most important thing a school offers.

280
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,250
True. True.

281
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,000
Educating the mind
without educating the heart

282
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,166
is no education at all.

283
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,875
Absolutely. I live my life by that quote.

284
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,083
It's Aristotle.

285
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,083
What a lovely old Greek fella, huh?
He loved to stroll.

286
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,250
Uh, this is PC Daley.

287
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,125
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, PC Daley.

288
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,208
The thing is, Robert--
Um, may I call you Robert?

289
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,833
Yes, Pippy. Poppy.

290
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,666
The boys haven't shown up at school
for the last three weeks, and the fear--

291
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,958
Yeah, well, we're all still adjusting
to our new situation

292
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,916
with the boys' mum being taken away.

293
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,541
We heard there was a fire.

294
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,000
Chip pan. You know, it happens.

295
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,416
- Anyone injured?
- No, no, we're all good.

296
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:25,166
We're all-- We're good, we're good here.

297
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,833
-Do you mind if we come in for a moment?
-No.

298
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,625
No, of course not.

299
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:42,375
-Entering the residence.
-Yeah, copy that. Standing by.

300
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:46,791
Just been doing
some spring cleaning, it's a little awry.

301
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,000
Gus, Eli, this is PC Daley.

302
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,875
She's from
the Department of Child Protection.

303
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:02,333
How you doin'?

304
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:05,375
Yeah. Yeah. We're really good. Yeah.

305
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:09,375
-Sorry about your finger, Eli.
-Accident with an axe, I heard.

306
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:14,791
Yeah, it was. It was really stupid of me.
I shouldn't have done it.

307
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,583
Poor Gussie
must've been devastated.

308
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:22,083
Oh, Gus doesn't really do devastated.
Uh… Why don't you have a seat, Poppy?

309
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:28,166
Why don't you boys make yourselves scarce
so we can get to know each other?

310
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,583
Chat and, uh…

311
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:31,958
Oh, there we go. Sorry.

312
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:33,750
Um, thank you.

313
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,166
Maybe scare up some tea and bikkies, hey?

314
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,208
- Uh, okay, that's it, good boys.
- Come on, Eli.

315
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:46,541
Oh!

316
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:49,166
Uh…

317
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,041
Right, well…

318
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,666
"Tea and bikkies"?

319
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:08,708
It must be nice to have the boys home.

320
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:12,208
Oh, it's a great gift
and an even greater responsibility.

321
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,000
You understand they can't stay
away from school indefinitely?

322
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:18,416
Well, that's what I keep telling them.
Don't I, boys?

323
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,708
- Yep!
- Yep!

324
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:23,916
Whoa!

325
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,875
Whoa. Oh!

326
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:26,833
Fuck.

327
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:32,416
Our, uh, records indicate
that the boys haven't been

328
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,375
to visit their mother in prison yet.

329
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:38,333
No. No, it's been a busy time
for all of us.

330
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,541
Quite the file you got there.

331
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:44,958
It adds up.

332
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:47,416
Yeah.

333
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,208
Obviously, the boys have experienced
a lot of trauma over the years.

334
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:57,583
The breakup of your marriage,
the criminal activity of their stepdad,

335
00:24:57,666 --> 00:24:59,666
and now the removal of their mother.

336
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,583
Here.

337
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:04,791
Okay.

338
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:06,666
Um…

339
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,666
Uh, thanks, Gus.

340
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,750
Uh, we'll speak to you
and Eli in a minute.

341
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:23,041
Maybe pack an overnight bag
for yourself and your brother.

342
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,916
Wait. Wait, what?

343
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,375
The thing is,
Robert, the staff at school

344
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:52,500
all value your sons immensely.

345
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:57,083
We all think they have exceptional minds.
Really quite exceptional.

346
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:59,083
So what's this about overnight bags?

347
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:02,041
So we're here
in the hope you can convince us

348
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,541
that we don't need to take action.

349
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:08,041
Are you threatening
to take my boys away from me?

350
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,708
- No one's threatening anyone.
- No?

351
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:14,291
'Cause I think I've lived long enough
to know a threat when I hear one.

352
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:15,375
Robert.

353
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:18,500
You come in here
with your do-gooder sincerity,

354
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:21,000
and your…
and your bloomin' interrogations.

355
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:24,833
Mr. Bell, there was a fire in your house
and serious injury to one of your kids.

356
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,583
It's not our job to put you at ease.

357
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:29,541
Oh, well, that's good to know,
'cause you're certainly not doing that.

358
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:32,250
The point is two boys
are now in your sole custody.

359
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,708
Because I'm their dad!

360
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:37,458
Your own police record
is not exactly spotless.

361
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:40,000
Look, I-- I-- I'm not gonna deny

362
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:43,583
that I have a problem
with the drink on occasion,

363
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:47,041
and one thing leads to another,
as we all know.

364
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:50,541
Disturbance of the peace.
Assault, occasioning physical injury.

365
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:54,458
Mostly-- Mostly,
I'll add, on the receiving end.

366
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:55,666
Ever against the boys?

367
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:59,416
Oh, look, maybe a clip around the ear
just to keep 'em in line.

368
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,916
Nothing more extreme?

369
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,041
Look, I don't know what you're--
What-- What are you accusing me of?

370
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm not accusing, just asking.

371
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:10,000
Can we talk about Gus's artwork?

372
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:11,291
Yeah. I-- I--

373
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:15,375
Let's. I'd-- I'd like that, Poppy.
Let's-- Let's talk about art.

374
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:18,000
These paintings,
they're very good.

375
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,166
For a 15-year-old,
they're actually quite exceptional.

376
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,416
But the choice of subject
is a little disturbing at times.

377
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,166
Active imagination.
It-- It runs in the family.

378
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:32,625
Jesus, God. How many files
have you people got on us?

379
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:35,250
This one is just Gus's school artwork.

380
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:36,708
I was saying to PC Daley,

381
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:40,083
for a long while, Gus has been stuck
on one particular image.

382
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:42,583
Well,
there's no law against that, is there?

383
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:46,541
This is his entry
into the science fiction competition.

384
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,125
Good, it's good.

385
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:51,916
And this is his family portrait.

386
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:02,250
Yeah, it's…
It's beautiful. It's beautiful.

387
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:05,458
He… He likes car journeys. He always has.

388
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:09,416
Eli told me Gus was painting
a dream which both boys had.

389
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:12,833
He can describe the dream
very specifically,

390
00:28:12,916 --> 00:28:15,750
the sound of the car engine
as it leaves the road,

391
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,458
the smell of upholstery.

392
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:19,375
Yes, that's our Eli.

393
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:21,166
He's big on the details.

394
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,708
The thing is,
shared dreaming is not unheard of,

395
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:27,208
but it's… it's very unusual.

396
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:30,958
So, I wonder
if it would be more helpful for us

397
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:34,083
if we call this incident
what it really is?

398
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,083
Not a dream, but a memory.

399
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,791
A car accident happened two days
after your wife left you, Mr. Bell.

400
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:55,125
Ah, come on. What do you gotta
to bring this shit up for?

401
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:58,708
In her initial statement, later retracted,
she said that she thought

402
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,333
you'd tried to kill the children.

403
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:01,333
Bullshit!

404
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:03,208
Retracted.

405
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,750
She was just upset with me.

406
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:08,291
- So you didn't try to kill them?
- Of course not!

407
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:14,458
You people, you love this.

408
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:17,666
You're lovin' this, aren't you?
You are lovin' this.

409
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:22,208
No, Robert. I'm here in good faith
to listen to your version of events.

410
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,833
I'm sure we both want
what's best for those boys.

411
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:27,958
Oh, and what's best
is to take them away from me?

412
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:29,291
No one's saying that.

413
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:32,166
It's what you're both thinking,
isn't it?

414
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:34,000
So, how's that gonna help?

415
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:35,750
You split 'em up.

416
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:37,458
All they got's each other.

417
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:41,083
You put 'em in foster care.
You tell 'em their dad's a monster.

418
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,416
I love the boys.

419
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:48,791
They're my boys.

420
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,708
Those days when they were little,
they were…

421
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:57,208
they were the happiest times of my life.

422
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:08,208
You drove them
into the countryside,

423
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:11,208
at night in their pajamas,

424
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:14,750
and the three of you ended up somehow
at the bottom of a lake.

425
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:17,416
Fuck!

426
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:29,666
Okay. All right,
I'm gonna tell you exactly what happened.

427
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,916
I was takin' the boys
out to Cedar Creek Falls

428
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,250
on a camping trip.

429
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:56,291
Their mum and I had been
going through some stuff.

430
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:03,750
But those boys, they love their campin',

431
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:05,666
under the stars.

432
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:11,458
I get these panic attacks
when-- when I get stressed,

433
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:14,041
and I've had 'em
since I was a little fella.

434
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,250
I got the shakes.

435
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,291
Real bad.

436
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:23,875
I was coming into a blind corner.

437
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:25,666
I couldn't see where I was going,

438
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,791
and I didn't realize
I was going as fast as I was.

439
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:26,958
Come here!

440
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:27,875
Eli.

441
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:39,958
Eli. Eli, come on.

442
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:42,125
Jesus, don't go away.

443
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,291
I thought I was gonna lose Eli.

444
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:50,291
Help! Someone please help!

445
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:52,333
Eli, hey.

446
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:57,083
The bloke who… who lived in the cottage
on the dam, he called for help.

447
00:33:57,583 --> 00:34:00,458
Oh, please. Please!

448
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:02,375
I was shakin' him.

449
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:08,666
Callin' out to God
and prayin' to bring him back.

450
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,125
Oh, my beautiful boy.

451
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:19,500
It's okay. Come on. Come on.

452
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:21,875
- The ambulance is coming.
- Eli.

453
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:24,958
Oh Jesus, you scared me.

454
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:41,083
When the ambos came,

455
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:43,875
they said that we weren't the first
to go off there.

456
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:49,166
And it was a miracle
that no one weren't really hurt.

457
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:54,250
I think we were just lucky.

458
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,333
Dad.

459
00:34:58,416 --> 00:35:00,541
Oh, give-- give us a moment, boys.

460
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:02,250
We're-- We're-- We're busy.

461
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,666
Come on, come on, fuck off.

462
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,833
What do you want?

463
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,958
Don't let them take us away, Dad.
We're not going.

464
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:15,500
We don't care what happened before.

465
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:19,125
Gus and me don't wanna live
anywhere else except here.

466
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:30,833
Robert, if you can assure me
the kids will be attending school again,

467
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:34,958
and you take them to see their mother,
then it's possible.

468
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:38,083
Look, I… I know I've been a shit-ass dad.

469
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:42,041
I can do that.
I'm gonna turn over a new leaf.

470
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,375
You'll see.

471
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:46,166
You'll see, boys.

472
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,875
See you.

473
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,791
Oh, come on.

474
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:35,000
God, you're an ugly bugger.

475
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:39,458
He probably thinks
the same thing about you.

476
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:42,875
Once had a guy who got done
for sexual offenses with one of these.

477
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:44,916
Females are better looking, yeah?

478
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:49,291
I don't think looks is a factor
if you're into sex with animals.

479
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,083
What's that for?

480
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:57,583
Cutting his fighting teeth.

481
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,625
So he doesn't take chunks
out of the other males.

482
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:06,541
About Lyle Orlik…

483
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:09,875
The shark attack?

484
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,458
A couple of people are wonderin'
if that bloke could be still alive.

485
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:18,833
With an injury like that,
I'd say you'd have to be pretty lucky.

486
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:21,541
Did he strike you as a lucky man?

487
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:24,916
Not lucky at all
was my overall impression.

488
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,083
What do you use these for?

489
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:30,833
Cutting his toenails.

490
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:36,500
His son lost a finger
in a domestic disturbance, apparently.

491
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,375
Dangerous world out there.

492
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,791
A chick I know from The Courier-Mail
was sniffing around the story.

493
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:54,208
I'll speak to the boss.
See if he wants us to plug any leaks.

494
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:57,750
See, plugging leaks
is kind of what I'm most worried about.

495
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:01,875
-I strongly advise you--
-Tim, let's just get this straight.

496
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,875
Unless you're paying us
and not the other way around,

497
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:07,875
you don't get to do
any "strongly advising."

498
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:09,791
I'm on your side, Ivan.

499
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:12,791
I'm just trying to keep
the, uh, shark attacks to a minimum.

500
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,625
Well, in that case,
maybe you should do your job.

501
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:17,541
Get those kids off the street

502
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:21,458
and maybe stop this journo from sticking
her nose where she's not wanted.

503
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:23,750
-Oh, I'm working on it.
-Clearly not well enough.

504
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:25,583
Just don't do anything drastic, right?

505
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:28,791
The journo knows to drop it,
and I'm gettin' the kids sorted.

506
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:30,666
You do that.

507
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:33,875
Or else I'll have to do it for you.

508
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:01,125
-Will you be all right?
-Yep.

509
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:03,375
Welcome back, Tinkerbell.
Can I make a wish?

510
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:09,333
Dear Gus and Eli,

511
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:11,708
your old mate Slim here.

512
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:15,958
Been tryin' to ring you
a couple of times, but, uh, no answer,

513
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:18,208
so I assume you're busy with stuff.

514
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:23,916
Just to tell you that, uh…

515
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,708
Well, just to report
that I've had a bit of bad news.

516
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,916
Just to say, I'd hate to part on bad terms
so if you fancy a spot of fishin'…

517
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,833
Fuck.

518
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:51,583
Come on. Come on, I'll get your dinner.
Come on. Come on.

519
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,708
Dad, we're ready.
We're gonna miss the bus.

520
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,791
It's visiting hours for Mum.

521
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:14,541
All right, look, uh, boys, um…

522
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:19,750
I can't do this. Sorry.

523
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:22,416
The fuck, Dad, you promised.
What do you mean you can't do it?

524
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,333
Yeah, I dunno.
I dunno. She still hates me,

525
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:29,666
and she blames me
for the car accident stuff, it's…

526
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,416
It's all right. We'll just explain to her
like you explained to Miss Birkbeck.

527
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,625
It's not good.
It's-- She-- She won't believe it, mate.

528
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:37,666
-No.
-Get his trousers.

529
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:39,291
All right. Okay.

530
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:43,000
Dad, they won't let us visit Mum
without you. You're coming.

531
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:45,416
Yeah, look, I'm sorry, mate. I'm sorry.

532
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,833
-Just grab him.
-No. What?

533
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:48,916
- Grab him and I'll put on his pants.
- No.

534
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:52,500
- Hold him, Gus! Hold him.
- Agoraphobia! Agoraphobia!

535
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,416
- No, no, no!
- Yes.

536
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,166
-Yes!
-Oh God.

537
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,083
Oh God. Oh God.

538
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:59,000
Uh…

539
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,791
What is it now, for fuck's sake?

540
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,125
My heart. I'm serious.

541
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:05,500
- No. Stop.
- Call an ambulance.

542
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:09,541
-There's nothing wrong with your heart.
-There is. Call the ambulance.

543
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:11,375
I'm not kidding.

544
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:15,500
Dial triple zero. Dial triple zero.

545
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,833
Right, step back, we've got him.

546
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,166
All right, Robert. Breathe.

547
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:51,875
Head up. You're gonna be all right.
We're takin' you in for a check-up.

548
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,333
-Has this happened before?
-All the time, mate.

549
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:57,375
Anxiety attack.

550
00:41:57,458 --> 00:42:00,666
I'll do an ECG and his blood chemistry.
You'll have him back this evening.

551
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,250
Hello, Jim.

552
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,583
Hey, Rob.

553
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,166
-Hey.
-Sorry, Frankie, they're not comin'.

554
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:22,833
-What do you mean, they're not coming?
-The boys' father had a medical emergency.

555
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:26,000
They pitched up late at the front desk
but they can't get in without an adult.

556
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:27,291
Nah, fuck that.

557
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:30,250
Hey, hey, hey! Frankie, come on.
Don't make a scene.

558
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:31,708
I wanna see my boys.

559
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:33,583
- I wanna see my boys!
- Frankie!

560
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:36,250
Frankie, if you don't behave,
we'll take away your visiting rights.

561
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:38,291
You won't see no one
this side of Christmas.

562
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:40,000
I wanna see my boys!

563
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:42,500
I wanna see my boys!

564
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:49,291
I wanna see my boys!

565
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:51,375
Mum!

566
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:52,458
Mum!

567
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:54,375
Mum!

568
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:55,416
Mum!

569
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,500
Mum!

570
00:42:56,583 --> 00:43:00,208
Oi, you two.
Fuck off, or I'm callin' the cops.

571
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:26,833
Mm…

572
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:28,208
Go on, then.

573
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:22,541
Hey, Shelly.

574
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,208
Hey, Gus.

575
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:25,666
Oh.

576
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:27,000
Thanks.

577
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,250
How's your mum going?

578
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:34,208
Uh, I dunno yet.
Um, Dad was gonna take us to see her.

579
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:38,541
I like your mum.
Give her a big hug from me.

580
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:42,541
I don't think you're allowed hugs
in prison visits.

581
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:45,166
Nah, well, you can't really do it
on crutches either, so…

582
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:47,083
How is the treatment going?

583
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:54,833
There isn't one.

584
00:44:54,916 --> 00:44:56,291
Muscular dystrophy.

585
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,458
The worst kind.

586
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:01,541
Nothing you can do for it
except watch it get worse.

587
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:06,916
After a while,
I'll be too weak for crutches,

588
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,708
and then I'll have a wheelchair
until I'm too weak to breathe.

589
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,583
But miracles still happen, hey.

590
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:22,541
You're talking again.

591
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:24,458
Fuck miracles.

592
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:27,458
Tell me how I can help.

593
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:34,291
You want a burger?

594
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:36,000
Whatever.

595
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:12,333
Yeah, is this Gill?

596
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:15,458
I need to arrange a meeting
with Slim Halliday.

597
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:17,125
Eli.

598
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,416
I'm a friend of his.

599
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:22,500
Just to say
that I really need some advice.

600
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,291
Catching anything?

601
00:46:54,666 --> 00:46:56,000
Couple of little ones.

602
00:46:57,833 --> 00:46:58,958
You back at school now?

603
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:05,625
Yeah.

604
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,208
The cops made us go.

605
00:47:08,916 --> 00:47:12,541
-That's the ticket. Been to see your mum?
-She's not even answering our letters.

606
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,916
-Maybe she's embarrassed.
-About what?

607
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,333
She didn't do anything wrong.

608
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:20,208
Yeah, well, you know,
women are weird sometimes.

609
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:22,833
Reckon that the screws
don't want us to speak to her,

610
00:47:22,916 --> 00:47:25,500
in case we agree to spill the beans
about Lyle and Ivan Kroll.

611
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:27,333
I'm sure she misses you, mate, but…

612
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:31,083
she'd want you blokes
to just forget about all that stuff

613
00:47:31,166 --> 00:47:32,541
and get on with your lives.

614
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:34,375
Send her a plum pudding for Christmas.

615
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:38,166
She won't get it. They're stopping
our mail from getting through.

616
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,500
Yeah, they do that sometimes.

617
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:43,791
There are other ways
besides Her Majesty's Postal Service.

618
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:44,833
Like what?

619
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:46,708
Hang on a moment.

620
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,166
You get a bite?

621
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,083
Nibble.

622
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:52,666
So, what other ways?

623
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,541
Well, there's this fella I know.

624
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:55,875
George Masoumi.

625
00:47:57,333 --> 00:48:00,833
He's been doing fruit deliveries
to Boggo Road for the past 12 years.

626
00:48:00,916 --> 00:48:01,916
Guards know him,

627
00:48:02,875 --> 00:48:05,583
and agree not to check
the false bottom of his crates.

628
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:07,250
So what does he smuggle?

629
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:09,625
Whatever you like.
Cigarettes, sexy underwear.

630
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:12,791
What's the point
of sexy underwear in prison?

631
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:16,666
Another of life's enduring mysteries.

632
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:21,333
So, if I wanted to get a parcel
in secret to Mum,

633
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:24,333
then I could just give George money.

634
00:48:24,416 --> 00:48:26,708
Nah, you wouldn't have to pay him.
I helped his brother

635
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:29,041
through a long stretch of porridge,
so he owes me.

636
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:32,958
-What do you want to send her?
-Escape equipment.

637
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:35,750
Oh, wake up, Eli. She'll get caught
and they'll double her sentence.

638
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:36,791
You got away with it.

639
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:39,375
Yeah, but I had nothing to lose.
I was in there for life.

640
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:42,375
-She'll be out in four Christmases.
-Four years, Slim.

641
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:45,125
I'll be 17.

642
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:52,916
I'm sorry.
I just really miss her, you know?

643
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:56,041
I've got no grown-ups now.

644
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:58,791
It's just you and Robert.

645
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:02,958
Yeah, I know. But four years is nothing
in the great scheme of things.

646
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:06,416
And she'll get time off
for, you know, good behavior.

647
00:49:07,666 --> 00:49:09,750
Just knuckle down at school.
Make her proud of you.

648
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:12,666
Whoa, hold on.

649
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:15,458
You got another bite?

650
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:17,083
Yeah, it's that mangrove jack.

651
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:19,458
Bloody must weigh about ten kilos now.

652
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:21,625
I been stalking it ever since I came here.

653
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:22,958
Clever as all buggery.

654
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:26,166
It'd be a bloody shame
to shuffle off before it does.

655
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:29,833
Reckon you still got
a few years yet, Slim.

656
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:31,750
Not really.

657
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:35,291
Oat cell carcinoma. Stage four.

658
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:39,125
How many stages are there?

659
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:42,500
Four.

660
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,125
So, how long
have you got left?

661
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:51,750
Just a couple of months.

662
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:55,083
Couple of months?

663
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:57,083
No, no, Slim. Slim.
Why haven't you told me?

664
00:49:57,166 --> 00:49:58,791
Yeah, I was gonna write you a letter, but…

665
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:01,541
…but, you know,
I'm not much chop with that.

666
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:06,833
Please tell me you're getting treatment.

667
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:10,333
Not gonna put that shit in me.
Better ways to die.

668
00:50:10,416 --> 00:50:14,541
But you can't die, Slim.
You're the only dad we've got left now.

669
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:15,708
Robert's your dad.

670
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:17,416
And, to be honest,

671
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:20,333
I've probably taught you
about as much as I can.

672
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:22,291
You need to get the treatment, Slim.

673
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:26,708
I need you to stay alive.

674
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:28,458
Please.

Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam,

680
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:53,791
Grab the rod! Grab the rod!

681
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:55,250
It's the fucking fish!

682
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:56,750
Grab it! Grab the rod!

683
00:50:57,625 --> 00:51:00,166
-Yeah. Pull him in! Pull him in!
-Is that a bloody shark?

684
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:03,416
No, it's that bloody mangrove jack
