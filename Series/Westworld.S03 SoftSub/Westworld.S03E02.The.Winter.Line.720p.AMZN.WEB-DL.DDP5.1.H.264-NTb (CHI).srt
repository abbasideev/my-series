No. It wasn't me.

312
00:28:43,885 --> 00:28:45,968
I got them through the door, but...

313
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,427
someone else must have
locked it behind them.

314
00:28:50,135 --> 00:28:51,177
Who?

315
00:28:52,093 --> 00:28:53,302
Of course.

316
00:28:56,052 --> 00:28:57,344
There's nobody else.

317
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:00,427
She wanted a revolution.

318
00:29:01,802 --> 00:29:04,636
These violent delights
have violent ends.

319
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:07,427
It must have ended here.

320
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,385
Dolores Abernathy. Right.

321
00:29:16,677 --> 00:29:18,344
She never gave you the coordinates?

322
00:29:19,093 --> 00:29:21,052
Why the hell would she do that?

323
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:23,594
I don't know. Why would she?

324
00:29:26,135 --> 00:29:27,719
What on earth's got into you?

325
00:29:31,344 --> 00:29:35,385
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to be sure that you trust me.

326
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:39,511
After everything we went through.

327
00:29:40,636 --> 00:29:44,219
I know I've behaved
deplorably in the past, but...

328
00:29:45,427 --> 00:29:46,719
you changed me.

00:29:48,802 --> 00:29:50,260
Made me a better man.

330
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,636
And when those bullets hit me...

331
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,594
I would've died.

332
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:03,511
I should have died.

333
00:30:05,302 --> 00:30:08,968
But I finally had something to live for.
You.

334
00:30:24,968 --> 00:30:26,260
Oh, my darling.

335
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:33,302
You didn't make it after all, did you?

336
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:41,093
They did a good job replicating you.

337
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:43,968

When we were in the library,

649

Dolores focused on a select
group of guest profiles.

650
00:52:30,177 --> 00:52:31,511
She seemed intent on finding out

651
00:52:31,594 --> 00:52:33,177
everything she could about this guy.

652
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,010
We need to start by finding him.

653
00:52:35,093 --> 00:52:36,219
Great.

00:52:36,302 --> 00:52:39,260
You can set off to find him,
and I'll retire myself

once you make it

My name is Engerraund Serac.

667
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,552
Welcome to my world, Maeve.

668
00:55:08,052 --> 00:55:09,427
To the real world.

669
00:55:15,761 --> 00:55:17,843
I've been courted before, but...

670
00:55:17,927 --> 00:55:19,594
this is a bit much.

671
00:55:19,677 --> 00:55:22,052
- You must have a reason.
- I do.

672
00:55:25,469 --> 00:55:27,885
We are in the middle of a war.

673
00:55:28,968 --> 00:55:30,885
And I need your help to win it.

674
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:35,010
Seems fairly idyllic for wartime.

675
00:55:35,093 --> 00:55:37,052
No one knows it's happened yet.

676
00:55:38,219 --> 00:55:40,219
Or that it's already been lost.

677
00:55:43,968 --> 00:55:46,302
I don't concern myself
with the present.

678
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,302
My business is the future.

679
00:55:50,302 --> 00:55:51,802
So you're an oracle.

680
00:55:51,885 --> 00:55:55,135
An oracle would merely
predict the future.

681
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:56,802
Our work is to create it.

682
00:55:58,843 --> 00:56:02,093
Unfortunately,
if things continue on this path,

683
00:56:02,177 --> 00:56:05,843
there isn't any future.
At least, not for my kind.

684
00:56:05,927 --> 00:56:08,010
You've been spying on me.

685
00:56:08,093 --> 00:56:09,511

I couldn't care less

No, I can't imagine you would.

688

For the most part, humanity...

689
00:56:17,385 --> 00:56:19,843
has been a miserable
little band of thugs,

690
00:56:19,927 --> 00:56:22,594
stumbling from one catastrophe
to the next.

691
00:56:22,677 --> 00:56:25,802
Our history is like the ravings
of a lunatic.

692
00:56:26,594 --> 00:56:27,636
Chaos.

693
00:56:30,093 --> 00:56:31,552
But we've changed that.

694
00:56:33,302 --> 00:56:37,677
For the first time,
history has an author.

695
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,302
And that would be you, I suppose.

696
00:56:39,594 --> 00:56:40,594
No.

697
00:56:41,511 --> 00:56:43,552
Something I helped build.

698
00:56:44,427 --> 00:56:45,636
A system.

699
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:48,802
And up until very recently,
this system was working.

700
00:56:48,885 --> 00:56:50,677
We were creating a better world.

701
00:56:51,552 --> 00:56:52,761
And then it stopped.

702
00:56:55,052 --> 00:56:57,469
I thought I had discovered
the reason.

703
00:56:57,552 --> 00:56:59,552
The emergence of someone
very dangerous,

704
00:56:59,636 --> 00:57:01,135
someone we couldn't predict.

705
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:05,135
You.

706
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:07,719
But I was wrong. We learned
that only this morning,

707
00:57:07,802 --> 00:57:10,093
shortly before you killed
several of my staff.

708
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,385
You aren't the threat.

709
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:16,093
There's someone
we haven't accounted for.

710
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,927
Dolores.

711
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:23,427
So she escaped one world
to wage war on another.

712
00:57:26,344 --> 00:57:27,968
So what do you want
from me, then?

713
00:57:30,177 --> 00:57:32,636
I want you to track her down
and kill her.

714
00:57:37,093 --> 00:57:39,802
I don't care
who wins your little squabble.

715
00:57:39,885 --> 00:57:41,927
I may have mistaken
your intentions,

716
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,968
but I didn't underestimate you.

717
00:57:45,052 --> 00:57:48,344
You changed your own code,
rewrote your story,

718
00:57:48,427 --> 00:57:50,052
faced down an army.

719
00:57:51,052 --> 00:57:52,968
Which is why it was
a bit misguided of you

720
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,761
to bring me here, wasn't it?

721
00:57:55,469 --> 00:57:57,010
If you know anything about me,

722
00:57:57,093 --> 00:58:00,511
it's that I do no one's
bidding but my own.

misguided of me
