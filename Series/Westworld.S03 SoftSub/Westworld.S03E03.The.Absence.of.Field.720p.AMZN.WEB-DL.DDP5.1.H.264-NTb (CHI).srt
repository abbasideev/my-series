something wrong.

320

Someone's trying to
take control of Delos.

323
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:54,999
The person we're looking
for is looking for us.

324
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,792
He has a mole inside the company.

325
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:04,291
If he finds out who I am,
what I am...

326

His mole won't find you.

327

Because you're gonna find
him first and kill him.

328
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:15,249
Then, you're gonna fend
off Serac's bid for Delos.

329

A counteroffer.

332
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:24,041
But you'll have to convince the
board, and for that,

333
00:27:24,124 --> 00:27:26,583
you'll need to pay a visit
to an old friend.

We will.

337
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,708
But until then,
we have to be smarter than them.

338
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:51,917
Or they will find us.

339
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,208
