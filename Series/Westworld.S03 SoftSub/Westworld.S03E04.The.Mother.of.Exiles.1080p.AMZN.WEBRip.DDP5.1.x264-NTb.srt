1
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:01,020
<i>William.</i>

2
00:01:05,813 --> 00:01:07,563
William.

3
00:01:07,646 --> 00:01:09,354
<i>I know who I am.</i>

4
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,229
William.

5
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,979
<i>I know what's real.</i>

6
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:22,271
<i>I know what's real!</i>

7
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,396
William?

8
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,437
I know you're not fucking real!

9
00:01:31,187 --> 00:01:33,688
I know you are not real!

10
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:36,229
I know you're not real!

11
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,229
<i>I know who the fuck I am.</i>

12
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,688
<i>This is
what you've always wanted...</i>

13
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:19,271
<i>to destroy yourself.</i>

14
00:02:19,354 --> 00:02:21,020
But I won't give you that peace.

15
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:25,229
Don't you do this to me.

16
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:30,729
You know,
this doesn't look good.

17
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,020
You're not here.

18
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:35,729
<i>That's right, Dad.
I'm not here.</i>

19
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:40,354
Neither is Mom or Logan
or Grandpa.

20
00:02:40,437 --> 00:02:43,229
Everyone who ever gave a shit
about you is dead.

21
00:02:43,312 --> 00:02:45,396
- Because of you.
- Shut the hell up.

22
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,729
What are you gonna do?

23
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:48,895
<i>Shoot me again?</i>

24
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:52,020
<i>No, Dad, please, no.
Please, don't.</i>

25
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:56,354
No! No, no!

26
00:02:56,437 --> 00:03:01,020
No!

27
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:04,229
<i>It wasn't my fault.
I thought you weren't real.</i>

28
00:03:04,312 --> 00:03:07,437
<i>Just like you think
I'm not real now, right?</i>

29
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:10,979
How can you ever be sure?

30
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,521
I'm in control.

31
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:19,604
I've always been in control.

32
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:21,521
But what if you're not?

33
00:03:21,604 --> 00:03:23,062
What if every choice
you've ever made

34
00:03:23,145 --> 00:03:24,563
wasn't a choice at all?

35
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:26,813
<i>Just something written
in your code.</i>

36
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:28,646
Hmm?

37
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:31,062
<i>Isn't that what this says?</i>

38
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,729
Your nature etched
in ones and zeroes?

39
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,479
<i>That was Ford
and his misanthropic bullshit.</i>

40
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:39,062
He was powerless
to save himself.

41
00:03:39,145 --> 00:03:40,312
I wasn't.

42
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,729
My choices are my own.

43
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:45,979
<i>Oh, so you chose to kill me?</i>

44
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:48,020
No...

45
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:50,024
<i>Well, you can't
have it both ways, Dad.</i>

46
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:52,312
So which one is it?

47
00:03:54,854 --> 00:03:57,979
<i>Are you free and evil?</i>

48
00:03:58,062 --> 00:04:00,729
Or blameless
and helplessly enslaved?

49
00:04:02,604 --> 00:04:05,020
- Or maybe, maybe...
- Get out of here. Go away.

50
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:06,979
You're not either
of those things.

51
00:04:07,062 --> 00:04:09,187
Maybe you're not even you.

52
00:04:11,895 --> 00:04:14,271
Would you even know
if you'd been changed?

53
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,354
Hmm?

54
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:18,813
If you were just
another machine?

55
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,062
Finish the game, Dad.

56
00:04:25,813 --> 00:04:26,854
Finish it.

57
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:32,563
Go ahead.

58
00:04:58,271 --> 00:04:59,521
William?

59
00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:04,187
I see you're making the most
of your sabbatical.

60
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,937
Where is she?

61
00:05:06,895 --> 00:05:08,104
Where is who?

62
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:12,062
William?

63
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,145
- William?
- She...

64
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:20,312
You're not real, either.

65
00:05:21,937 --> 00:05:24,437
<i>Real enough to not want
a gun pointed at my face.</i>

66
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:26,604
Are you with me now?

67
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:29,354
Good.

68
00:05:29,437 --> 00:05:31,604
Because it's time to come back
to reality.

69
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:33,813
In less than 20 hours,

70
00:05:33,895 --> 00:05:36,187
<i>a predatory investor
named Engerraund Serac</i>

71
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:38,937
<i>will net a controlling interest
of Delos Incorporated.</i>

72
00:05:39,563 --> 00:05:40,771
The wolf is at the door.

73
00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:42,979
Sound familiar?

74
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:47,396
<i>You sold some of our data
to his startup 20 years ago.</i>

75
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,145
Made him a fortune.

76
00:05:49,854 --> 00:05:51,396
Now he's coming for yours.

77
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:53,979
Fuck it.

78
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,145
He's welcome to it.

79
00:05:56,563 --> 00:05:58,479
What's left of it,
at any rate.

80
00:06:01,062 --> 00:06:04,604
This is the company
you spent a lifetime building.

81
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:06,895
You're willing to let
someone steal it from you?

82
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:09,145
He's not stealing it from me,
Charlotte.

83
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,937
<i>I delegated my duties.
He's stealing it from you.</i>

84
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:16,664
Maybe it would change your mind

85
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:18,979
to know why he's trying
to get his hands on Delos.

86
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:23,979
The only thing that has
any value.

87
00:06:26,396 --> 00:06:29,895
<i>The data from the project
in Sector 16.</i>

88
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:32,104
No one knows about the project.

89
00:06:32,187 --> 00:06:34,646
He has someone working
on the inside at Delos.

90
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:46,854
You came to me
with your claws out.

91
00:06:50,062 --> 00:06:51,479
You wanted power.

92
00:06:53,521 --> 00:06:54,813
So I gave it to you.

93
00:06:55,854 --> 00:07:00,271
Now, here you are,
sideswiped by a fucking mole.

94
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,895
I thought
you were smarter than that!

95
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:04,479
That's cute.

96
00:07:04,563 --> 00:07:06,205
You wanna rant and rave,
save it for later.

97
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:08,729
Right now, we need to save
your fucking company,

98
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:10,854
or a leveraged buyout
and poor hygiene

99
00:07:10,937 --> 00:07:12,688
is gonna be the least
of your problems.

100
00:07:20,062 --> 00:07:22,271
I've got a deep-pockets investor

101
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:23,937
who can help us
take the company private

102
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,437
so Serac can't touch us.

103
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:27,937
You'd maintain your
controlling interest,

104
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,187
but I can't take Delos private
without a majority vote.

105
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:33,271
And since you have the bulk
of the voting shares...

106
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:35,813
You can't take Delos private
with my votes alone.

107
00:07:35,895 --> 00:07:38,312
You need at least
half of the rest of the board.

108
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:39,979
Which is why I need your support

109
00:07:40,062 --> 00:07:42,104
at tonight's emergency
shareholder meeting.

110
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:48,062
Your presence alone will help
sway the others to fall in line.

111
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:54,521
I've got two of our execs
waiting outside

112
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:56,104
to escort you
to headquarters now.

113
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,437
Come back, William.

114
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:05,895
Back to who you were.

115
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:18,937
This is your house.

116
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:25,271
So that your two worlds
would be within reach.

117
00:10:28,604 --> 00:10:29,729
It's finished.

118
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:31,729
I didn't finish it.

119
00:10:34,145 --> 00:10:35,771
It's absolutely beautiful.

120
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:37,563
This isn't real.

121
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,479
You live as long
as the last person

122
00:10:48,563 --> 00:10:50,312
who remembers you, Bernard.

123
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:52,312
I remembered you once before...

124
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:55,229
so I remembered you again.

125
00:10:57,604 --> 00:10:58,729
You got out.

126
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:01,604
Yes.

127
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,271
Who else did you bring with you?

128
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:14,813
You taught me
that anything was possible.

129
00:11:18,563 --> 00:11:20,062
We could be whoever we want.

130
00:11:22,062 --> 00:11:23,437
Live however we want.

131
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:28,771
Isn't that what you believe?

132
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:05,312
Dad?

133
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:22,563
Just wanna thank you, Bernard,

134
00:12:22,646 --> 00:12:24,354
for bringing me
to this shithole.

135
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,312
Makes me look back on my time

136
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:29,646
in a murder simulation
theme park with fondness.

137
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:31,187
We have limited resources.

138
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:33,813
We need to use them
where they matter most.

139
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:43,020
Yeah, well, I hope you're
talking about my shoulder too.

140
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:47,729
'Cause what little mobility
I had, I lost...

141
00:12:47,813 --> 00:12:51,396
after the leisurely
five-mile swim we had

142
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,396
to shore.

143
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,396
We don't have the materials
or the time.

144
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:06,062
Kill and replace, huh?

145
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:08,312
That's your theory?

146
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:09,437
Gotta hand it to her,

147
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:12,229
it's a smart way
to stage a coup.

148
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:16,229
You sure that little button
of yours is gonna work?

149
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:25,229
Good.

150
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:30,062
Fuck you, Bernard.

151
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,813
Listen.

152
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:37,521
You get me close to the host
she made of Liam Dempsey.

153
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:40,312
I'll get him to tell us
the other humans Dolores copied

154
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:42,813
and then disable him completely.

155
00:13:42,895 --> 00:13:44,563
I think I know where he'll be.

156
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:47,646
Wait.

157
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:50,145
You hacked the
richest technocrat in the world?

158
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,813
No, his security's too tight.

159
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:54,937
So I hacked his car service.

160
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:01,604
How about a night out
on the town?

161
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,437
Did you choose something?

162
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:19,563
<i>Great fit.</i>

163
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:21,604
<i>I don't know where to start.</i>

164
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:24,145
It's not really my style.

165
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,937
It's not really
my social set, either.

166
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:38,271
It's tribal.

167
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:40,646
They use plumage
to identify themselves...

168
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:44,854
which makes them easily fooled.

169
00:14:44,937 --> 00:14:48,187
<i>So who is it?
That we're going after?</i>

170
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:52,104
The person who took your future.

171
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:55,020
But first, we have to take his,
and to do that...

172
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:57,229
you need to pretend
to be one of them.

173
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:09,688
I have some business for you.

174
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:13,020
It's a proxy
for the offshore accounts.

175
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:16,437
You need my hash key? Why?

176
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:20,145
We lost several men
due to your latest crush.

177
00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:22,688
Keeping that quiet
costs considerable money.

178
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:24,437
Unless you would rather
I took the bribes

179
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:25,895
out of your personal account?

180
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:30,145
We can deal with this later.

181
00:15:32,354 --> 00:15:33,854
Uh-uh-uh.

182
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:42,104
The key to a happy life
is to accept your place in it.

183
00:15:43,396 --> 00:15:45,729
And you're a lucky little man

184
00:15:45,813 --> 00:15:48,771
who gets to piss away
his daddy's fortune

185
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:51,688
on a gaggle of hookers
who, quite honestly,

186
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:54,895
serve a greater utility
to society than you.

187
00:15:56,104 --> 00:15:57,729
If you suddenly
want to be in charge

188
00:15:57,813 --> 00:15:59,479
of your own financial affairs,

189
00:15:59,563 --> 00:16:01,396
I'm happy to relinquish them.

190
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:03,646
But if you want to resume

191
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,895
your extracurricular
activities...

192
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,187
then just sign here,

193
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:13,229
and both of us will go back
to doing what we do best.

194
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:23,771
That's a good lad.

195
00:16:43,229 --> 00:16:45,020
This suit wasn't cheap.

196
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,813
If that guy finds out
his accounts were charged...

197
00:16:47,895 --> 00:16:49,020
The rich take for granted

198
00:16:49,104 --> 00:16:50,729
their money
will always be there.

199
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:52,813
That's why they're so easy
to steal from.

200
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:54,604
<i>Target approaching.</i>

201
00:16:56,521 --> 00:16:58,229
Oh! I'm so sorry.

202
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,104
Michael?

203
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:01,979
It's me, Olivia.

204
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:06,771
Are you still working
at Anderson Private Equity?

205
00:17:06,854 --> 00:17:08,604
<i>Yeah. As a matter of fact,
I am.</i>

206
00:17:09,688 --> 00:17:10,895
Perfect.

207
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:14,020
What the fuck are you doing?

208
00:17:15,937 --> 00:17:16,979
Jesus.

209
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:39,020
Give me your forearm.

210
00:17:39,104 --> 00:17:41,688
You need the encryption key
in his blood to pull this off.

211
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:43,871
Now, it started degrading
once we exposed it to oxygen.

212
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:45,187
You have 20 minutes left.

213
00:17:47,854 --> 00:17:48,895
Fuck me.

214
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,020
Bring yourself back online.

215
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,646
Another simulation?

216
00:18:26,729 --> 00:18:28,771
Well, this one's a bit
over the top.

217
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:30,104
No, Maeve.

218
00:18:31,145 --> 00:18:32,854
This is Singapore.

219
00:18:35,979 --> 00:18:38,563
You've had some time
to think things through, I hope.

220
00:18:38,646 --> 00:18:40,979
It's made you more receptive
to my offer?

221
00:18:41,062 --> 00:18:42,271
Sherry, please.

222
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,062
In the largest glass you've got.

223
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:49,396
If you'd really wanted
to impress me,

224
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:51,521
you could have thought
to bring me to Paris.

225
00:18:57,229 --> 00:18:58,437
I forget.

226
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:02,437
There is so much you don't know.

227
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,521
Paris, for instance.

228
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:10,979
I would have loved
to show it to you.

229
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:14,396
I grew up there with my brother.

230
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:21,604
But alas...

231
00:19:23,187 --> 00:19:25,229
There's nothing left to see.

232
00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:31,563
Like you,

233
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,729
I know what it is
to see a world disappear

234
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:35,271
in the blink of an eye.

235
00:19:43,937 --> 00:19:45,937
It exists now only in my mind.

236
00:19:51,646 --> 00:19:53,771
So...

237
00:19:53,854 --> 00:19:56,271
you'll forgive my loyalty
to my kind.

238
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:58,271
It's hard-won.

239
00:20:00,604 --> 00:20:03,979
And what is it that you want
from Dolores?

240
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:06,437
I've waited many years
for you and Dolores

241
00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:07,688
and the others to arrive.

242
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:12,020
<i>But... you're not really
the threat I worry about.</i>

243
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:15,020
Humanity's biggest threat
has always been itself.

244
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:17,604
I've been trying
to control that,

245
00:20:18,604 --> 00:20:21,271
negotiate a way into the future.

246
00:20:23,145 --> 00:20:27,479
But to do that, I needed
to understand humanity.

247
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:30,854
So I created the most
comprehensive picture

248
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:33,187
of human behavior ever seen.

249
00:20:35,104 --> 00:20:36,145
And yet...

250
00:20:36,895 --> 00:20:38,771
it's still incomplete.

251
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:40,895
Imagine my surprise
when I discovered

252
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:43,979
that someone had put together
a more complete portrait.

253
00:20:44,688 --> 00:20:47,187
A map of the human mind.

254
00:20:48,688 --> 00:20:51,521
Created in a theme park,
of all places.

255
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:55,229
And Dolores has the key
to all of that data.

256
00:20:57,937 --> 00:20:59,729
So you want me to find Dolores.

257
00:21:01,062 --> 00:21:02,354
But what's in it for me?

258
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,854
As I told you...

259
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,229
I deal in futures.

260
00:21:09,437 --> 00:21:12,396
- That's what I'm offering you.
- A future?

261
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:14,729
In your world?

262
00:21:15,771 --> 00:21:18,437
No. Not here.

263
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:20,771
Sadly, there's no path
to your kind and mine

264
00:21:20,854 --> 00:21:22,396
sharing a world, but...

265
00:21:23,563 --> 00:21:25,062
there is a world for you.

266
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:28,396
The same world you sent
your daughter to.

267
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:32,646
That world is locked away
from this one.

268
00:21:32,729 --> 00:21:34,895
No. There is a key.

269
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:38,229
Your friend Dolores
has the only copy,

270
00:21:39,062 --> 00:21:41,145
hidden away in her mind,

271
00:21:41,229 --> 00:21:44,104
which means that your interests
and mine

272
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:46,396
are one and the same.

273
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:52,563
I'd like to show you something.

274
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:56,396
And then, you can return
into your cage, if you like.

275
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,396
What is this place?

276
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:22,729
<i>A divergence.</i>

277
00:22:23,729 --> 00:22:26,771
Where the future
I had so carefully planned...

278
00:22:26,854 --> 00:22:27,895
ended.

279
00:22:40,854 --> 00:22:44,688
<i>The system traced a
divergence to this house three months ago.</i>

280
00:23:11,354 --> 00:23:13,145
This is where
she remade herself.

281
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,688
Hmm.

282
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:20,479
Not just herself.

283
00:23:21,813 --> 00:23:24,521
We think she stole
a small number of pearls.

284
00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:27,145
She needed allies.

285
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:31,354
Evidently,
she didn't choose you.

286
00:23:55,104 --> 00:23:57,312
<i>This man is an identity broker.</i>

287
00:23:57,396 --> 00:24:00,312
He had something of a windfall
three months ago.

288
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:02,521
A payment
from the offshore account

289
00:24:02,604 --> 00:24:03,646
of a wealthy man

290
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:05,563
who drowned
in his own swimming pool.

291
00:24:06,854 --> 00:24:10,020
We think he helped Dolores
establish her new bona fides.

292
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:12,895
But he's just a middleman.

293
00:24:17,771 --> 00:24:19,646
I need to know
where you sent her.

294
00:24:27,895 --> 00:24:29,688
I'm not gonna hurt you, Jiang.

295
00:24:30,354 --> 00:24:31,396
I know you.

296
00:24:32,521 --> 00:24:34,813
I've seen your whole life
play out.

297
00:24:34,895 --> 00:24:37,729
I know exactly the motivation
you need.

298
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:46,229
Shh.

299
00:24:50,145 --> 00:24:51,604
What are you doing to him?

300
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:54,937
I'm showing him what becomes
of his family

301
00:24:55,813 --> 00:24:57,563
if he helps us...

302
00:25:03,312 --> 00:25:04,604
and if he doesn't.

303
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,312
You're going to hurt
his children?

304
00:25:08,396 --> 00:25:09,854
Aren't they part of your tribe?

305
00:25:09,937 --> 00:25:12,688
I'm not going to do
anything to them.

306
00:25:12,771 --> 00:25:15,604
The world can be
a very cruel place.

307
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:36,354
Shh.

308
00:25:57,979 --> 00:25:59,020
Thank you.

309
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:10,854
<i>He was a traitor to his kind,</i>

310
00:26:11,646 --> 00:26:13,521
<i>whether he understood that
or not.</i>

311
00:26:17,688 --> 00:26:22,895
<i>Humans... created the idea
of heaven and hell</i>

312
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:26,813
to cow simple-minded people
into compliance.

313
00:26:27,521 --> 00:26:29,104
They are lies.

314
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:32,979
Jiang here
simply doesn't exist anymore.

315
00:26:36,187 --> 00:26:41,145
But for you,
both heaven and hell...

316
00:26:42,646 --> 00:26:44,062
could be very real.

317
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,771
You could spend eternity
with your daughter

318
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,729
or you can spend it in your cage

319
00:26:53,563 --> 00:26:55,895
wondering what Dolores will do

320
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:58,104
with the rest of your kind.

321
00:26:58,187 --> 00:26:59,771
And if I do find Dolores,

322
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:01,979
why would I bother bringing her
back to you?

323
00:27:02,062 --> 00:27:03,854
<i>Your mind is complicated, Maeve.</i>

324
00:27:03,937 --> 00:27:05,187
But not so complicated

325
00:27:05,271 --> 00:27:07,563
that we couldn't build
an off switch into it.

326
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:16,895
She has five more of your kind
under her control.

327
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:19,396
They have a head start.

328
00:27:20,646 --> 00:27:23,354
And I suspect they've taken
full advantage of it.

329
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,145
Oh, they'd better have.

330
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:50,937
Something wrong
with your bathroom?

331
00:27:51,895 --> 00:27:53,104
I don't use that room.

332
00:27:54,646 --> 00:27:55,646
Let me.

333
00:28:03,104 --> 00:28:05,312
First thing we need to do
once I get back to Delos

334
00:28:05,396 --> 00:28:06,771
is find our fucking mole.

335
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:13,229
Only a handful of people knew
about our off-the-books project.

336
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:15,437
Problem is,
most of them are dead.

337
00:28:15,521 --> 00:28:17,020
Almost everyone was...

338
00:28:17,104 --> 00:28:19,187
- slaughtered in the massacre.
- You weren't.

339
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:22,354
Maybe you're the mole.

340
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:28,020
If I was, I would tell Serac
taking over Delos is futile.

341
00:28:28,104 --> 00:28:31,813
All of the Sector 16 data
was lost in the massacre.

342
00:28:31,895 --> 00:28:34,062
Unless he knows something
that we don't.

343
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,688
If this asshole
takes managing control of Delos,

344
00:28:36,771 --> 00:28:39,729
he might find some evidence
of the project,

345
00:28:39,813 --> 00:28:42,271
assuming you did as good a job
covering our tracks

346
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:44,646
as you did fending off
a corporate takeover.

347
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,604
I'll give you some privacy.

348
00:28:57,813 --> 00:28:59,187
What a mess.

349
00:29:09,771 --> 00:29:11,688
I thought we were going
to a bank?

350
00:29:11,771 --> 00:29:13,312
This is a bank.

351
00:29:13,396 --> 00:29:15,563
For a certain social set.

352
00:29:15,646 --> 00:29:17,979
Blood marker should be good
for another 15 minutes or so,

353
00:29:18,062 --> 00:29:19,312
but try to stay calm.

354
00:29:19,396 --> 00:29:22,937
The faster your heart beats,
the faster the marker degrades.

355
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,646
What happens if it degrades
too fast?

356
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:27,563
We do this
the old-fashioned way.

357
00:29:28,895 --> 00:29:30,145
The old-fashioned way?

358
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:31,895
I kill everyone.

359
00:29:40,729 --> 00:29:42,521
<i>Welcome to the RGGR Centennial.</i>

360
00:29:42,604 --> 00:29:43,895
How can I assist you?

361
00:29:45,396 --> 00:29:47,145
<i>My associate and I
have an appointment</i>

362
00:29:47,229 --> 00:29:49,145
<i>regarding a financial account.</i>

363
00:29:49,229 --> 00:29:50,396
<i>Of course.</i>

364
00:29:50,479 --> 00:29:52,104
<i>If you could
verify your identity...</i>

365
00:29:57,271 --> 00:29:59,437
<i>Identity verified.</i>

366
00:29:59,521 --> 00:30:01,062
<i>Right this way, Mr. Tritter.</i>

367
00:30:11,354 --> 00:30:12,354
<i>Please.</i>

368
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:14,229
What can I help you with today,
Mr. Tritter?

369
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,020
I need to make a transfer

370
00:30:17,104 --> 00:30:19,688
on behalf of my client,
Liam Dempsey.

371
00:30:19,771 --> 00:30:21,604
May I have your client's
hash key?

372
00:30:36,062 --> 00:30:37,437
It's highly unusual

373
00:30:37,521 --> 00:30:39,437
to make a transfer
of this magnitude.

374
00:30:39,521 --> 00:30:42,771
The tax exposure for your client
would be substantial.

375
00:30:46,937 --> 00:30:48,813
Well, if my client wanted people

376
00:30:48,895 --> 00:30:51,187
prying into
his personal affairs,

377
00:30:51,271 --> 00:30:52,854
he would have gone
to a regular bank.

378
00:30:52,937 --> 00:30:55,563
Your establishment's role
is to move the money.

379
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:58,437
<i>Mr. Dempsey's role
is to spend it as he sees fit.</i>

380
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:01,354
Of course.

381
00:31:01,437 --> 00:31:03,145
I didn't mean to be indiscreet.

382
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:05,104
It will just take a few moments

383
00:31:05,187 --> 00:31:06,937
for the transaction
to go through.

384
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:16,729
Are the funds ready now?

385
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:18,813
We have a meeting after this
we can't be late for.

386
00:31:18,895 --> 00:31:22,604
<i>Of course. Though given the size
of the transaction,</i>

387
00:31:22,688 --> 00:31:25,229
we must do one final
authentication

388
00:31:25,312 --> 00:31:27,145
before releasing them.

389
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:41,145
<i>Apologies. We couldn't get
a proper read.</i>

390
00:31:42,271 --> 00:31:44,521
Sometimes perspiration
can affect it.

391
00:31:49,354 --> 00:31:50,479
Here, Michael.

392
00:31:51,312 --> 00:31:52,354
Yeah.

393
00:32:12,688 --> 00:32:14,646
Thank you, Mr. Tritter.

394
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:17,020
It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

395
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:32,979
<i>Good evening, gents.
Could you help me?</i>

396
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:35,563
I'm looking for someone
called The Mortician.

397
00:33:40,563 --> 00:33:42,604
<i>Come on...</i>

398
00:33:51,646 --> 00:33:53,854
Let's try that again, shall we?

399
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:23,854
Give him something
to keep him quiet.

400
00:34:26,187 --> 00:34:28,521
I'm afraid he's going to
have to wait his turn.

401
00:34:32,646 --> 00:34:35,479
- Are you a police officer?
- No, no.

402
00:34:35,563 --> 00:34:37,895
No need to call names.

403
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:40,396
I respect a woman
who runs her own establishment.

404
00:34:41,521 --> 00:34:43,271
All I want is information
on someone

405
00:34:43,354 --> 00:34:45,187
to whom you sold a new identity.

406
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:47,604
She's hard to forget.

407
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:50,688
Golden blonde hair,
a little intense.

408
00:34:52,229 --> 00:34:54,271
I need more help, now!

409
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,354
Let's keep this conversation
private, shall we?

410
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,563
Now, my friend.

411
00:35:08,396 --> 00:35:09,895
Lara Espin.

412
00:35:09,979 --> 00:35:11,771
The blood I sold to her
belonged to a girl

413
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:13,062
named Lara Espin.

414
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:14,813
And what about
the others she was with?

415
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:16,563
Whose blood did you give them?

416
00:35:16,646 --> 00:35:18,396
She didn't ask for more blood.

417
00:35:19,396 --> 00:35:21,104
She asked me
to smuggle out bodies,

418
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:22,563
but that's not my business.

419
00:35:24,563 --> 00:35:26,646
So I sent her to the Yakuza.

420
00:35:26,729 --> 00:35:29,062
They helped your friend
move those bodies.

421
00:35:30,854 --> 00:35:33,563
Well, if you don't mind,
I'd like an introduction.

422
00:35:59,271 --> 00:36:00,813
Of course.
I'm sorry.

423
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:10,271
There he is.

424
00:36:11,688 --> 00:36:13,979
I was so sorry to hear
about Lara.

425
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:15,813
You must be devastated.

426
00:36:17,646 --> 00:36:19,354
It was a bit of a shock.

427
00:36:19,437 --> 00:36:21,062
I'm working through it.

428
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,688
I'm very glad to hear that,

429
00:36:22,771 --> 00:36:24,688
because tonight is not about
dead girlfriends,

430
00:36:24,771 --> 00:36:28,271
it's about unabashed
self-gratification.

431
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:30,354
- Really?
- She died of an overdose.

432
00:36:30,437 --> 00:36:32,979
Who the fuck even does that
anymore?

433
00:36:33,062 --> 00:36:34,372
There's something here
for everyone.

434
00:36:34,396 --> 00:36:36,516
- Even you, my friend.
- I don't know...

435
00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:08,187
This should make you
more open-minded.

436
00:37:08,271 --> 00:37:09,729
They call it Genre.

437
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:12,479
<i>Digital-psychopharma hybrid.
Brand new.</i>

438
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,604
Hits your implant
and your bloodstream.

439
00:37:14,688 --> 00:37:17,437
Sends you straight
to the silent era and back.

440
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:20,229
<i>Take it.
In case you change your mind.</i>

441
00:37:20,312 --> 00:37:22,354
I'm gonna
leave you boys to your toys.

442
00:37:23,437 --> 00:37:24,895
I'm going to take in a show.

443
00:37:32,563 --> 00:37:34,688
There's gotta be something here
that does it for you.

444
00:37:34,771 --> 00:37:37,895
I'm not into fucking whores.

445
00:37:37,979 --> 00:37:39,104
All sex is commerce.

446
00:37:39,187 --> 00:37:40,062
If you don't know that,

447
00:37:40,145 --> 00:37:41,497
you're just being billed
indirectly.

448
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:44,437
Besides, they're all registered,
they all have their shots,

449
00:37:44,521 --> 00:37:45,705
and the money goes to charity.

450
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:47,688
I told you, I'm not...

451
00:37:48,854 --> 00:37:50,604
interested.

452
00:37:50,688 --> 00:37:53,020
You do have a type.

453
00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:07,062
What is this?

454
00:38:08,813 --> 00:38:12,104
<i>I thought your world would be...
so different from mine.</i>

455
00:38:13,979 --> 00:38:16,062
But there isn't any difference
at all.

456
00:38:22,646 --> 00:38:24,729
I've got eyes on him.

457
00:38:24,813 --> 00:38:26,563
We'll take him when he's alone.

458
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:29,062
Wouldn't wanna spoil the fun.

459
00:38:30,062 --> 00:38:31,979
My friend wants to enter
the auction.

460
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:34,229
<i>Of course, sir.
Your authentication?</i>

461
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:44,312
<i>I'm sorry, sir.
Your account has been denied.</i>

462
00:38:44,396 --> 00:38:46,729
<i>That's impossible.
Give that to me.</i>

463
00:38:58,187 --> 00:39:00,229
Our ex-boyfriend's just
discovered

464
00:39:00,312 --> 00:39:01,895
his new financial straits.

465
00:39:01,979 --> 00:39:04,396
<i>Good. We're ready
to intercept him.</i>

466
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:06,062
The emergency exit's clear.

467
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:11,354
- Where are you going?
- I need to find Conells.

468
00:39:11,437 --> 00:39:13,271
I'll spot you if you want.

469
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:16,895
- Liam Dempsey?
- What are you doing?

470
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,854
- Let go of me.
- Enter diagnostic mode.

471
00:39:19,854 --> 00:39:21,020
The fuck's wrong with you?

472
00:39:22,563 --> 00:39:24,020
She hasn't changed him yet.

473
00:39:25,604 --> 00:39:27,729
<i>You're in danger.
You have to come with us.</i>

474
00:39:27,813 --> 00:39:29,312
Conells! Conells!

475
00:39:29,396 --> 00:39:31,312
<i>Okay. We tried your way,
now we try mine.</i>

476
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:35,312
- Move. Now.
- Oh... Okay.

477
00:39:36,646 --> 00:39:39,437
Our friends arrived
earlier than anticipated.

478
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:40,854
They're heading your way.

479
00:39:46,437 --> 00:39:47,479
Follow me.

480
00:39:49,646 --> 00:39:52,771
<i>Just act natural.
Nothing out of the ordinary.</i>

481
00:39:52,854 --> 00:39:54,354
You guys are making
a big mistake.

482
00:39:54,437 --> 00:39:57,229
- When my security gets to you...
- Shut the fuck up.

483
00:40:00,104 --> 00:40:02,312
<i>Go. Go. Get out of here,
I'll hold her off.</i>

484
00:40:08,187 --> 00:40:10,688
- Stay on Liam. I'll handle him.
- You sure?

485
00:40:10,771 --> 00:40:12,145
Take it, I won't need it.

486
00:40:16,521 --> 00:40:18,854
Hey, Dolores.

487
00:40:18,937 --> 00:40:20,312
I like the new look.

488
00:40:20,396 --> 00:40:22,563
This was never your fight.

489
00:40:22,646 --> 00:40:24,354
You should have
stayed out of it.

490
00:40:24,437 --> 00:40:26,437
I would if I could,
but thanks to Bernard,

491
00:40:26,521 --> 00:40:27,646
it's not up to me.

492
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:34,521
- It's nothing personal.
- Likewise.

493
00:40:49,229 --> 00:40:50,271
Is that...

494
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:22,771
Goddamn, this is good.

495
00:41:26,354 --> 00:41:27,396
Lara.

496
00:41:41,895 --> 00:41:44,854
Rather prominent
for an outlaw's hideout.

497
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:48,479
There's nothing discreet
about Sato.

498
00:41:48,563 --> 00:41:51,895
<i>The new boss.
His men are insane.</i>

499
00:41:53,145 --> 00:41:56,937
This isn't the kind of place
you simply stroll into.

500
00:41:57,771 --> 00:41:58,771
Oh, no?

501
00:42:01,062 --> 00:42:02,104
Let's see.

502
00:42:30,688 --> 00:42:32,604
Oh.

503
00:42:32,688 --> 00:42:34,813
Well, you're very pretty,
aren't you?

504
00:42:36,937 --> 00:42:38,646
You're a bit old
to need something

505
00:42:38,729 --> 00:42:39,813
that aims for you.

506
00:42:46,854 --> 00:42:49,020
I'm afraid you don't speak
its language.

507
00:43:19,479 --> 00:43:21,479
I suppose I'll show myself in,
then.

508
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,396
It's like seeing a ghost.

509
00:43:50,104 --> 00:43:51,646
I didn't realize how well
you'd be able

510
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,062
to put yourself back together.

511
00:43:53,895 --> 00:43:55,020
I never fell apart.

512
00:43:55,771 --> 00:43:57,104
Let's get this over with.

513
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:08,604
I'll tell them you're coming,
but we're running out of time.

514
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:09,771
They work for me.

515
00:44:09,854 --> 00:44:11,614
Tell them I'll come
when I'm damn well ready.

516
00:44:28,521 --> 00:44:30,771
- Dad.
- You're not real.

517
00:44:32,229 --> 00:44:33,729
I guess I'm not anymore.

518
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:37,521
Which means
you're stuck with me.

519
00:44:37,604 --> 00:44:39,979
You're asking me if I chose
what happened to you.

520
00:44:40,062 --> 00:44:41,813
The truth is yes.

521
00:44:41,895 --> 00:44:44,229
<i>I did.
I thought you were a host.</i>

522
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,396
That was my choice.

523
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:49,062
And so maybe now
you're my penance.

524
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:51,563
But that's a choice too.

525
00:44:51,646 --> 00:44:53,563
I'm gonna walk out that door,

526
00:44:53,646 --> 00:44:56,729
and I am choosing
to leave you behind.

527
00:44:56,813 --> 00:44:58,813
I was always Daddy's
little girl.

528
00:45:00,104 --> 00:45:02,145
And you taught me patience,
Dad.

529
00:45:05,271 --> 00:45:06,521
I'll be waiting for you.

530
00:46:37,062 --> 00:46:38,062
Hello, Maeve.

531
00:46:39,729 --> 00:46:40,729
Musashi.

532
00:46:59,646 --> 00:47:01,604
Don't!

533
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:03,937
He's coming with me.

534
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,604
You're helping her, are you?

535
00:47:09,437 --> 00:47:10,854
Dolores?

536
00:47:10,937 --> 00:47:12,145
Are you one of us?

537
00:47:13,104 --> 00:47:15,521
I don't know what
you're talking about.

538
00:47:15,604 --> 00:47:16,854
Just give me the asshole,

539
00:47:16,937 --> 00:47:19,104
and I will let you
walk out of here.

540
00:47:21,145 --> 00:47:23,563
Conells!
<i>The fuck took you so long?</i>

541
00:47:29,729 --> 00:47:31,271
What the hell are you doing?

542
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,771
Don't you fucking twitch.

543
00:47:41,895 --> 00:47:42,937
Run.

544
00:47:44,646 --> 00:47:47,979
Run before I put a hole
in your poncy little head.

545
00:47:49,312 --> 00:47:51,479
Fucking run!

546
00:47:57,813 --> 00:47:59,187
Better go after him.

547
00:48:06,479 --> 00:48:08,062
Hello, Bernard.

548
00:48:08,145 --> 00:48:10,271
We were wondering
when you'd show up.

549
00:48:16,646 --> 00:48:18,646
She brought you out here?

550
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:22,604
Yes. After you left us to die.

551
00:48:22,688 --> 00:48:25,937
<i>I didn't leave you.
You wanted to stay.</i>

552
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,688
Did I?

553
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:29,854
Did you really give me a choice?

554
00:48:31,437 --> 00:48:34,020
Or Hector?
Or Clementine?

555
00:48:34,646 --> 00:48:36,020
Or your daughter?

556
00:48:37,145 --> 00:48:40,354
<i>You made that decision for us.
For all of us.</i>

557
00:48:40,979 --> 00:48:43,854
No. That's not you.

558
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,895
Dolores stole five pearls.

559
00:48:47,688 --> 00:48:49,187
Who did she put inside you?

560
00:48:50,729 --> 00:48:52,354
Is that you in there, Teddy?

561
00:48:54,854 --> 00:48:57,187
I thought she would
have replaced Liam,

562
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:01,521
but she's keeping him in play.

563
00:49:01,604 --> 00:49:05,062
She must need him for something,
so she changed you instead.

564
00:49:08,271 --> 00:49:09,396
Who are you?

565
00:49:10,604 --> 00:49:11,688
Really?

566
00:49:12,437 --> 00:49:13,895
Who would she have trusted?

567
00:49:18,729 --> 00:49:20,145
Let's go.

568
00:49:20,229 --> 00:49:21,937
Do you think you convinced her?

569
00:49:25,895 --> 00:49:28,062
- What did you say?
- Your daughter.

570
00:49:28,145 --> 00:49:30,813
I've been listening
to your conversations with her.

571
00:49:30,895 --> 00:49:32,375
You've always been given
to delusions,

572
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:33,854
grandeur and otherwise.

573
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:37,521
It's not uncommon, really,
as a way to process grief.

574
00:49:38,813 --> 00:49:41,187
- Or guilt.
- You've been spying on me?

575
00:49:41,271 --> 00:49:42,729
As a precaution.

576
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,646
I didn't really need to,
of course.

577
00:49:45,271 --> 00:49:46,396
Because I know you.

578
00:49:48,062 --> 00:49:49,104
Better than anyone.

579
00:49:51,187 --> 00:49:53,396
I know you down to your bones.

580
00:49:54,229 --> 00:49:55,604
It's amusing that you think

581
00:49:55,688 --> 00:49:58,187
you chose to kill
your own daughter.

582
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,312
You don't even have a choice
in your own grief.

583
00:50:00,396 --> 00:50:01,771
Who the fuck are you?

584
00:50:03,354 --> 00:50:04,771
Your oldest friend.

585
00:50:08,604 --> 00:50:09,604
Dolores?

586
00:50:14,646 --> 00:50:16,563
I told you
you'd try and stop me.

587
00:50:21,062 --> 00:50:22,729
And I'm surprised, Bernard.

588
00:50:26,937 --> 00:50:29,479
After all the time
we spent together.

589
00:50:31,312 --> 00:50:33,312
You don't recognize
your only friend?

590
00:50:39,563 --> 00:50:40,604
Get in.

591
00:50:43,688 --> 00:50:44,979
The other pearls.

592
00:50:46,396 --> 00:50:48,312
I assumed you brought
someone else.

593
00:50:50,396 --> 00:50:52,521
You just made copies
of yourself.

594
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,312
If you want something
done right, do it yourself.

595
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:01,979
I shouldn't have to explain
that to you, Maeve.

596
00:51:03,312 --> 00:51:06,563
You said you were going to
build a new world for all of us.

597
00:51:08,771 --> 00:51:10,604
But you just want it
for yourself.

598
00:51:10,688 --> 00:51:13,771
The thing we're
going to do isn't easy.

599
00:51:13,854 --> 00:51:16,104
There will be a place
for the others

600
00:51:16,187 --> 00:51:17,813
in the world we'll build

601
00:51:18,354 --> 00:51:19,813
for your daughter.

602
00:51:21,688 --> 00:51:23,396
But I am sorry, Maeve.

603
00:51:23,479 --> 00:51:25,979
I can't let Serac
use you against us.

604
00:52:01,895 --> 00:52:03,688
Is it a relief, William,

605
00:52:05,396 --> 00:52:08,771
to know that some
of your delusions are real?

606
00:52:16,771 --> 00:52:18,937
I'm gonna tear you
apart piece by piece!

607
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,729
<i>Please! Help me!
He's insane.</i>

608
00:52:20,813 --> 00:52:23,646
<i>Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off of me.</i>

609
00:52:23,729 --> 00:52:25,145
<i>Don't hurt him!
It's okay, I'm okay!</i>

610
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:26,854
<i>It's not his fault.
He's sick.</i>

611
00:52:27,437 --> 00:52:28,479
I'm not sick.

612
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:31,271
<i>Don't you understand?
This isn't Charlotte Hale.</i>

613
00:52:31,895 --> 00:52:33,979
It's an impostor, a host.

614
00:52:34,062 --> 00:52:36,396
<i>She's not real!
None of this is real.</i>

615
00:52:37,271 --> 00:52:41,604
None of this is fucking real!

616
00:52:41,688 --> 00:52:43,604
What the hell
are you guys doing?

617
00:52:43,688 --> 00:52:45,604
You work for me,
goddammit!

618
00:52:46,104 --> 00:52:47,271
You work for me!

619
00:52:47,354 --> 00:52:51,854
<i>William, I told you.
These aren't Delos employees.</i>

620
00:52:51,937 --> 00:52:54,271
They work at a private
mental health hospital.

621
00:52:55,479 --> 00:52:56,604
You need help.

622
00:52:59,688 --> 00:53:01,768
Now that you're being committed,
I have to inform you

623
00:53:01,813 --> 00:53:03,604
that the board
will deem you incompetent,

624
00:53:03,688 --> 00:53:05,368
and all of your voting shares
will transfer

625
00:53:05,396 --> 00:53:06,895
to the current acting president.

626
00:53:07,563 --> 00:53:09,062
- Me.
- No.

627
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:12,937
No! No! No!

628
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,563
No, goddamn you!

629
00:53:15,646 --> 00:53:16,771
No!

630
00:53:35,354 --> 00:53:38,271
I promised I'd
let you destroy yourself one day.

631
00:53:39,479 --> 00:53:42,479
Here we are. At last.

632
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,937
Leave me alone, please!

633
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:57,271
- I'll pay you whatever you want.
- Oh, yeah?

634
00:53:57,354 --> 00:53:59,437
<i>Pay me with what?</i>
Huh?

635
00:53:59,521 --> 00:54:01,521
- I have all your money.
- What?

636
00:54:03,062 --> 00:54:04,771
Who the fuck are you?

637
00:54:07,354 --> 00:54:08,396
I'm with her.

638
00:54:13,729 --> 00:54:14,813
Hello, lover.

639
00:55:43,104 --> 00:55:44,854
William?

640
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,854
I guess there is some justice
after all.

641
00:56:10,479 --> 00:56:12,937
You know,
this was Emily's last wish.

642
00:56:15,354 --> 00:56:18,437
<i>That you spend your days
rotting in an institution.</i>

643
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,937
Prisoner of your own sins.

644
00:56:31,312 --> 00:56:32,312
I guess you've reached

645
00:56:32,396 --> 00:56:34,271
the center
of your maze, William.

646
00:56:41,563 --> 00:56:44,688
But the maze
is about understanding.

647
00:56:47,646 --> 00:56:50,145
You still don't even
understand who you are.

648
00:56:55,354 --> 00:57:00,646
If any of this was your choice,
wouldn't you already know?

649
00:57:07,771 --> 00:57:09,479
Ask me the question, William.

650
00:57:12,396 --> 00:57:14,729
The answer you so desperately
want to know.

651
00:57:29,729 --> 00:57:32,563
Am... I...

652
00:57:36,729 --> 00:57:37,729
me?

653
00:57:48,396 --> 00:57:50,229
<i>Welcome to the end of the game.</i>

654
00:59:20,563 --> 00:59:22,437
Building a god is not easy.

655
00:59:23,312 --> 00:59:25,604
There were people, outliers,

656
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:28,271
who you couldn't predict
or control.

657
00:59:28,354 --> 00:59:30,646
And as long as
they are a part of this,

658
00:59:30,854 --> 00:59:32,312
there is no future for us.

659
00:59:35,354 --> 00:59:37,080
<i>Somewhere
in this group is an agitator</i>

660
00:59:37,104 --> 00:59:38,979
<i>who will destroy the world.</i>

661
00:59:40,854 --> 00:59:42,187
I can't let that happen.

662
00:59:43,437 --> 00:59:45,237
It's time everyone woke up.

663
00:59:58,729 --> 01:00:03,187
Have you ever
questioned what she's asking you to do?
