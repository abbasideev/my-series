1
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,960
We have to stop them, Lucy.

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,000
He needs you on my side.

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,800
Okay.

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,840
Okay.

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,040
You wake me up.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,400
We stop him.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,120
But when it's done,

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,160
when he's gone,

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,680
you stay away from me.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,040
I make my own fate

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,800
on my own terms.

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,720
And we never speak again...

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,280
in that life, or any other.

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,320
Deal.

15
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,200
Shepherd. On your feet.

16
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,840
You've got another visitor.

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,960
There's no one else on my list.

18
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,520
Special dispensation.

19
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,240
You're still alive.

20
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,120
Have we met?

21
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
We have.

22
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,920
And we will. It's all relative.

23
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,600
You're not on my list.

24
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,000
You're not supposed to be here.

25
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
Yeah.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,080
I get that a lot.

27
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,880
Your watch has stopped.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,160
Couldn't part with it.

29
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,760
Someone once told me it was important.

30
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,440
What do you want from me?

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,520
You're going to change
more than you realise.

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,960
You played with the chaos,
and the chaos spat me out.

33
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,680
Not alive, exactly, but something adrift.

34
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Unbound.

35
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,280
That's impossible.

36
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,520
My whole life's impossible.

37
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,640
So is yours.

38
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,240
Yet here we are.

39
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,880
Who are you?

40
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,880
What do you want from me?

41
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,200
My name's Isaac Chambers,

42
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,880
and I want to know
why you killed my mother.

43
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,400
<i>Coming up on the show,
we've got Neil Cock coming in</i>

44
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,600
<i>to discuss his new novel,</i> Snowflakes.

45
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,200
<i>And we talk to paranormal podcaster,
Alice Rider</i>

46
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,880
<i>about the UK's most haunted locations,</i>

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,360
<i>from a bridge in Kilmarnock
to a go-kart track in St Kenneth.</i>

48
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,120
<i>But first, we're kicking off
your Saturday morning mix</i>

49
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,800
<i>with the Hazy Eights' "Supposed to Be."</i>

50
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,240
I'm gonna un-cuff one hand
so you can eat.

51
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,240
Don't try anything.

52
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Yeah.

53
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,480
- Lucy...
- It's best if we don't talk.

54
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,840
If you let me go,
I'll tell them you helped me.

55
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,440
Whatever he said to you,
whatever he has done, we can get you help.

56
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,760
We're both his victims.

57
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,840
Eat your sandwich.

58
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
Please.

59
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,440
I made your favourite.

60
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Eat it.

61
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,280
Good guess, right?

62
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,560
Or Ravi told you.

63
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,800
You know you're mildly allergic
to tomatoes?

64
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,760
It's why you get stomach cramps sometimes.

65
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,400
You usually figure that out in your 40s.

66
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,360
You don't stop eating them,
you just slice them... thinner.

67
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,160
Help me escape.

68
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,400
If you give evidence against him,
then maybe you can walk away.

69
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
Look,

70
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,960
- I don't think you're a bad person...
- But I will be.

71
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,560
I will be. If I walk away,
that's exactly what I will be.

72
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,880
Is there no part of you that remembers?

73
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,840
Remembers what?

74
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,960
All those children.

75
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,520
The ones who die today.

76
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,200
The ones who come after.

77
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,880
Just let me go.

78
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,800
I'm begging you.

79
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,120
I have a wife.

80
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,000
I have a child, Lucy.

81
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,160
Eat your sandwich.

82
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,320
We have to
do something about her.

83
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,880
We'll figure it out after.

84
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,880
If you let her go, you'll have to run.

85
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,880
- Lucy.
- It happens this morning.

86
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,360
- We need to focus.
- Where'd you leave your car?

87
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,960
It's outside Dhillon's place.

88
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,200
We'll pick it up on the way.

89
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,440
Park it on Brennan Street.
Gives us more options.

90
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,160
Get that map.

91
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,160
Keep it.

92
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,520
If you need me,
that's where I'll be tonight.

93
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,880
There is no tonight.

94
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,320
I'm giving you today.

95
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,200
That's all.
Whatever happens, this is as far as I go.

96
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,320
'Cause it has to end.

97
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,520
It never ends.

98
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,720
Isaac. Come here, sweetheart.

99
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,120
I have to go out for an hour or two.

100
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,760
I need you to stay here with Grandma.

101
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,120
Rest that leg.

102
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,360
Okay. Have you got your phone?

103
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,240
Keep it on you, yeah?

104
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,760
Come here. Give me a cuddle.

105
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
Don't go.

106
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,400
I will be back here before you know it.

107
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,880
Bad things are going to happen.

108
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,000
No.

109
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,360
No, they're not
because I'm going to fix it.

110
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,320
I'm gonna fix it.

111
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,880
<i>The lives we lead
are like tracks in the snow.</i>

112
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,840
<i>And when we live them again</i>

113
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,440
<i>we're walking in the tracks
we left behind.</i>

114
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,760
<i>But if our path changes,</i>

115
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,600
<i>there are no tracks.</i>

116
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,440
<i>It's like wading through a thick powder.</i>

117
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,080
<i>Some people find it hard.</i>

118
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,120
<i>A powerful explosion originated
on the first floor of the building</i>

119
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,640
<i>just after 11:00 a.m.</i>

120
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,480
<i>Not broken.</i>

121
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,880
<i>Not today.</i>

122
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,040
<i>Why did you think
this was broken? Did it look broken?</i>

123
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,680
<i>I'm not cold.</i>

124
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,080
<i>Do you think
it's because we're talking?</i>

125
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,000
<i>Do you think if we go really quiet,
you might be able to hear them?</i>

126
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,360
<i>Shall we try that?</i>

127
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,400
<i>All right, erm, close your eyes for me.</i>

128
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,880
<i>Keep them closed.</i>

129
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,960
<i>I'm gonna put some music on.</i>

130
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,920
<i>Now, you can listen to the music,</i>

131
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,240
<i>or you can listen to the voices.</i>

132
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,120
<i>Come from behind the curtain,
Amelia. Come on.</i>

133
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,440
<i>Let me see your lovely face.</i>

134
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,560
<i>It's not lovely,
it's ugly and horrible.</i>

135
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,400
<i>Well,
that's not a very nice thing</i>

136
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,360
<i>to say about yourself, is it?</i>

137
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,840
<i>One hour to go.</i>

138
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,680
I could get them out.

139
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,600
I could warn them.

140
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,480
No, you couldn't. If we change too much,
we could spook him.

141
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,880
Yeah, well, he won't know it's changed.

142
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,360
<i>No, but he will sense a déjà vu.</i>

143
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,640
Don't engage,
we both need to see his face.

144
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,200
That's the priority.

145
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,800
So what, you see his face,
learn who he is,

146
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,880
and you come back next time
and kill him as a baby?

147
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,920
I've never murdered a baby.

148
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,080
Oh. Well, that's good.
That's good to know.

149
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,880
Thank you for clearing that up.

150
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,400
<i>I don't know what's gonna happen next
but I have an idea.</i>

151
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,920
<i>An omen.</i>

152
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,480
<i>Lucy,</i>

153
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,040
<i>- if we don't survive this...</i>
- We do!

154
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,920
We have to.

155
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,200
<i>What are you doing?</i>

156
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,760
<i>I'm marking the moment.</i>

157
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,800
That is criminal damage.

158
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,200
- It's romantic.
- It's a crime.

159
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,760
You're a criminal. What are you carving?

160
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,360
It's just our initials.

161
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,280
And then every year on our anniversary,
we add another mark.

162
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
That is cheesy.

163
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,720
Cheesy vandalism, destruction of property,
anti-social behaviour.

164
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,680
You should get a big cheesy ASBO.

165
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,040
Oh, come on, it's not like I'm drawing
a big willy or something.

166
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,720
I would love that.
Do a big willy, go on.

167
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,160
Then every year we can come back
and add to it.

168
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,960
How exactly would we add to it?

169
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,960
I don't know. Erm, hairs?

170
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,800
You want to mark the years of our marriage
with crudely drawn pubes?

171
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,720
Hello, Lucy.

172
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,880
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

173
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,560
Oh, still holed up
in Leeds's finest hotel.

174
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,920
- Why?
<i>- Turn on the news.</i>

175
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,040
<i>Police have not confirmed
whether the attack was terror-related.</i>

176
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,160
Is that Hackridge?

177
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,440
<i>We're at the scene.</i>

178
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Is it safe?

179
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,280
<i>Er...</i>

180
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,000
What happened?

181
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,440
<i>Okay, yeah. Understood. I'll brief them.</i>

182
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,760
<i>Sorry, I've got to go.</i>

183
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,800
What... Lucy.

184
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,280
<i>We don't yet know
the precise cause of the blast</i>

185
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,880
<i>which</i> occurred <i>just after 11:00 a.m.</i>

186
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,520
Say cheese.

187
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,480
Cheese.

188
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,280
Let me see.

189
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,000
You're slipping.

190
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,280
Where's that watch?

191
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,800
Oh, well, this won't do, will it?

192
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,160
This won't do at all.

193
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,160
Leave it with me.

194
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,920
I'm sure I used to keep
some tape in here.

195
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,920
All right. Here we go.

196
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,000
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

197
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,200
Hello?

198
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,560
Is somebody there?

199
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,320
Are you here?

200
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,720
Is this now?

201
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yes.

202
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,160
Please, Evelyn.

203
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,200
It is Evelyn, isn't it?

204
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,160
I don't like it here.

205
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
Neither do I.

206
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,520
Can you hear them?

207
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,200
The voices.

208
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
The voices?

209
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,440
Yes.

210
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,800
I hear them all the time.

211
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,040
Do you know how to stop them?

212
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
No.

213
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,080
You have to listen to them, Evelyn.

214
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
Yeah?

215
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,080
You have to give them what they want.

216
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,040
What do they want?

217
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,440
I think they want you to let me go.

218
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,800
There.

219
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,760
That's better isn't it?

220
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,640
It's quiet.

221
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,760
Well, you can still hear them.

222
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,920
But only if you want to.

223
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,240
They still arguing?

224
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,320
Is it them?

225
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,320
No.

226
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,440
What do we do?

227
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
Hide.

228
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,400
Stop it. Stop it!

229
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,760
Shh-shh. Shh.

230
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,800
It's going to be okay. All right?

231
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,000
No one's gonna hurt you. I promise.
Just... Just stay there.

232
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,760
Where did they go?

233
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,040
You must be the mother.

234
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,880
Did you see where they put my keys?

235
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,560
Thank God. Thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you.

236
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,240
Not long now.

237
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,040
Are you still there?

238
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,440
Yeah, sorry.
Just had to get out of earshot.

239
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,480
<i>How many people are up there?</i>

240
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,880
Er, right now I count...

241
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
nine.

242
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,480
<i>Think anyone's noticed you?</i>

243
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,840
Not particularly.

244
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,800
<i>Be careful of the staff.</i>

245
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,560
Yeah, I will, I know what I'm...

246
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
<i>Lucy.</i>

247
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,800
There's a bag.

248
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,120
<i>- What?</i>
- There's a bag. Someone left a bag.

249
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,680
<i>What sort of bag?</i>

250
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,440
Er, rucksack.

251
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,160
Oh, you must have missed him.

252
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,280
<i>I didn't.</i>

253
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,440
Then where is he?

254
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
<i>Look around.</i>

255
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
Hang on.

256
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,880
<i>Lucy. Look around, you have to find him.</i>

257
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,240
<i>- Lucy?</i>
- Just wait.

258
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,160
- Oi! What do you think you're doing?
- Er...

259
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,760
- Why you going through my bag?
- Erm... Well, you just left it.

260
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,360
What? I was right there.

261
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,600
I'm really sorry,
I just... I thought it was...

262
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,016
- You thought it was what? Up for grabs?
- Is everything okay?

263
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,080
No, not really.

264
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,176
- It's fine. Just a misunderstanding.
- I leave my bag for a second,

265
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,480
she's going through it.

266
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,760
Look, I'm just, erm... I'm sorry, I...

267
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,096
- Er...
- Well, don't let her leave.

268
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,576
- I'm... I'm sorry.
- Don't let her leave.

269
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,640
Hey!

270
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,720
Oh, my...

271
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,160
- Are you there?
- What happened?

272
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,640
<i>Oh. I made a mistake.</i>

273
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,600
- Did you see his face?
<i>- It wasn't his bag.</i>

274
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,000
I can't go back in there.
You'll have to take over.

275
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,320
Well, er, that is not going to work.

276
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,480
Well, it's our only option.

277
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
My face has been
all over the fucking television,

278
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,176
<i>- it's not gonna work.</i>
- It's the only play we have.

279
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,880
Look, I'll come back to the car.

280
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,240
Lucy, don't...

281
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
God.

282
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,016
- Isaac? What's going on sweetheart...
<i>- Mum.</i>

283
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,120
- ...are you okay?
<i>- I've been trying to call.</i>

284
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,560
<i>We had to leave.</i>

285
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,840
Who's we? What happened?
Did someone come to the house?

286
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,240
<i>Grandma said we had to leave,</i>

287
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,120
<i>but I said we had to help you,
otherwise, they'll find you</i>

288
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,560
<i>and they'll take you away.</i>

289
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,480
I don't... I don't know what you're saying,
darling, where are you?

290
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,920
We're under the bridge
where you used to play...

291
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,080
Poohsticks.

292
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,880
Poohsticks.

293
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,480
<i>Why, Isaac? Why did you leave the house?</i>

294
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
She escaped.

295
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,960
<i>She'll be back soon.</i>

296
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,560
<i>Grandma says we're not safe here.</i>

297
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,640
Er...

298
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,960
<i>I think I can hear them.</i>

299
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,880
Erm, listen to me.
Listen, you don't let anyone find you.

300
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,680
You stay where you are, okay?

301
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,496
<i>- Will you come?</i>
- Yeah, I'm coming right now.

302
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,160
Just... Just stay on the phone.

303
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,000
<i>Welcome to
the Tidal phone voicemail service.</i>

304
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,760
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

305
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,080
Lucy, where the fuck are you?
Don't do this to me.

306
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,000
We're almost out of time.
You need to come back, do you understand?

307
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,400
You can't fucking do this!

308
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,360
Show me your face.

309
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,320
Show me your face.

310
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,400
- Can I have a word?
- Yeah, all right.

311
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,400
Erm, what's your name?

312
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,600
Er, it's Frank.

313
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,680
Frank, I need you to get
everyone out of the building.

314
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,120
- There's been a suspected bomb threat.
- What?

315
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,920
Quick as you can but do it quietly.
Don't cause a panic.

316
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,920
Er, right.

317
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,096
Say there's a carbon monoxide leak,
whatever you want.

318
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,280
Just get everyone
well clear of the building

319
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,240
and don't go upstairs.

320
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,680
I'll send them down to you.

321
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Don't worry.

322
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,960
Everything's gonna be fine.

323
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
Right.

324
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,760
Madam. We've got a security issue.

325
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,536
You need to take
your son outside right now.

326
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,440
What?

327
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,640
Right now, please.

328
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Okay.

329
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,960
Guys, these are all free today
but you've got to go downstairs right now.

330
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,920
Says who?

331
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,200
I do. I'm a policeman.

332
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,040
Go on, go. Before I change my mind.

333
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,960
Now come along.
Yep, we're going now.

334
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,720
Why, we haven't even got our toys.

335
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,040
Stay where you are, please.

336
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
Turn around.

337
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,360
I said turn...

338
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
Dhillon!

339
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,400
Put pressure on it.

340
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,360
Leave it in.
Leave it in or you'll bleed out.

341
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,600
Dhillon. Look at me.

342
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,960
Look at me.

343
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,560
Where did he go?

344
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,400
I'm sorry.

345
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,640
Police, open up!

346
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,440
Open the door.

347
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,920
Isaac?

348
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
Mum?

349
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,520
We're down here.

350
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,120
Isaac.

351
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,200
We have to go.

352
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,040
Isaac, Mum, hurry up!

353
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
Okay.

354
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,440
Isaac, what are you doing?

355
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,120
We don't need this.

356
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,120
Okay, okay.

357
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,280
Just pick it up quickly, okay?

358
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,080
Lucy.

359
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,360
Lucy?

360
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,960
Lucy? I know you're there.

361
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,920
I've got six armed officers out here.

362
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,520
I'd like to send them home.

363
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,160
But first I need to come in there

364
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,640
and make sure everyone's okay.
Can I do that?

365
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,640
No one else needs to follow me
unless you give them a reason to, okay?

366
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,680
Lucy Chambers, you are under arrest

367
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,080
on suspicion of the murder of Steven Dunn,

368
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,400
kidnap, assaulting a police officer,

369
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,840
and conspiracy to commit
a terrorist offence.

370
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
What?

371
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,096
- What, you're wrong, I didn't...
- You don't have to say anything,

372
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,400
but it may harm your defence

373
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,056
- if you do not mention when questioned...
- Sam, what...?

374
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,856
- ...something that you later rely...
- What are you saying because that's not...

375
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,760
...that you later rely on in court.

376
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,880
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

377
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,800
Did it go off?

378
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,800
The bomb?

379
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,040
What happened?

380
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,056
We're gonna take you down to the station
to answer some questions there,

381
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,200
but first...

382
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,360
first we need to know

383
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,280
- where we can find Gideon Shepherd.
- No, no, no. He was supposed to stop it.

384
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,000
So just tell me, Sam.

385
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,160
Just tell me what happened.

386
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,920
Hold there. Hold, hold.

387
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,480
Officers were dispatched
to 13 Wenbourne Street

388
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,160
following reports of an explosion there.

389
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:01,680
An eyewitness spotted Shepherd
in the area moments before.

390
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,440
That's all we know.

391
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,640
Cuff her.

392
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,760
Isaac.

393
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,480
- Isaac, come back here, my love.
- Hey.

394
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,440
Hey, hey. It's okay.

395
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
Erm...

396
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,680
Mummy is just gonna help us
answer some questions. That's all.

397
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,440
You want to take her away.

398
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
Isaac.

399
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,400
Come on.

400
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,080
Hey, come on.

401
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,920
Hey, it's all right.

402
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,400
You have to let me go, okay?

403
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,280
Look, you just stay with Grandma.

404
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,120
She will look after you

405
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,840
until I get back, yeah?

406
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,400
I'm sorry.

407
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,160
I'm so sorry.

408
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,280
You took me with you.

409
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,640
- There's no house because...
- There's no me.

410
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,800
So this is before?

411
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,160
Sometimes.

412
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,160
Sometimes it's before.
Sometimes it's what comes next.

413
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,640
You know what comes next?

414
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,600
Er, this... this isn't right.

415
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,400
You... You shouldn't have brought me here.

416
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,640
I had to. You said I had to.

417
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,280
What?

418
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,440
- You said we had to get away.
- No, I didn't. I didn't, sweetheart.

419
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,160
You will.

420
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,360
It's cold. Why is it so cold here?

421
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,080
It's always cold.

422
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,760
Where are we going?

423
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,640
We have to get away.

424
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,960
Isaac, Isaac. Stop, stop, stop.

425
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,040
This isn't right. I'm not...
I'm not supposed to...

426
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,640
Isaac?

427
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,520
Boyd.
We checked the whole house.

428
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,080
- There's nothing.
- No.

429
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,720
No, there wouldn't be, would there?

430
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,600
Because she disappeared.

431
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,640
She just disappeared.

432
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,240
Ah, trick of the light.

433
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,440
Maybe a hallucination.

434
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,320
You know, I was raised
to believe in miracles, but...

435
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,880
And now I've actually seen one, I can't...

436
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,080
- I can't even...
- But people don't just disappear, Boyd.

437
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,480
It's impossible.

438
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,640
It's not impossible if she did it.

439
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,080
It wasn't her.

440
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,200
It was him.

441
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,240
Isaac?

442
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,320
He's a special boy.

443
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,800
Special how?

444
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,880
Well, that's the question.

445
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,280
He can see the birds.

446
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,040
And they can see him.

447
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,880
He feels like a memory

448
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,200
and a promise,

449
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,840
and a wish.

450
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,560
He says he's not supposed to be here,
but that's not true.

451
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,200
Oh, no.

452
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,960
No, I think...

453
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,960
I think that Isaac
is exactly where he's supposed to be.

454
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,200
He's not coming.

455
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,200
No, don't... Don't scratch.

456
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,120
- It hurts.
- I know. I know.

457
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,040
But you don't have to walk on it anymore.

458
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,880
We're gonna get help, okay?

459
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,760
I just...

460
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,840
I need to make a call.

461
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,600
Okay.

462
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,880
Ma'am?

463
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,480
Found this in the sink.

464
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,000
Okay. I'll call it in.

465
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,280
Thank you for coming.

466
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,800
Did you fill up on the way?

467
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,480
Two miles back, I've got a full tank.

468
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,640
I'll pay you back.

469
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,680
We have to stay off the main roads.
I've worked out a route.

470
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,360
- Lucy.
- Take us as far as Gloucester.

471
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,440
- We'll make our own way from there.
- Where? Where are you going?

472
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,760
It's...

473
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,920
It's better if you don't know.

474
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,280
Better for who?

475
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,720
I know you've been lying to me.

476
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,880
About what happened last year.
About Isaac.

477
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,560
I never lied to you about Isaac.

478
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,760
- I can't help you if you don't talk to me.
- I will.

479
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,800
I will, but not here. In the car.
We cannot stay out here.

480
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,080
There's a road block on the 325.
Someone knows we're here.

481
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,040
What?

482
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,280
We have to move.

483
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,320
What happened at Rigby's?

484
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,200
Did you catch him? Did you see his face?

485
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,920
No. Someone did.

486
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,160
Gideon.

487
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,560
He came out of nowhere.

488
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,800
He could have killed me
but he let me live.

489
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,200
- Why?
- No idea.

490
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,240
But he'll regret it.

491
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,880
We can't use the roads.

492
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,440
Every route will be blocked.

493
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,920
We have to
take the foot path through the farm.

494
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,880
Make for the woods on the other side.

495
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,000
But we... we can't take him with us?

496
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,440
No, we can't.

497
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,880
You have to leave me.

498
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,960
It's the only way to stop him.

499
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,160
Everything is gonna be okay.

500
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,200
I promise.

501
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,720
I will... I will come back for you.
Do you understand?

502
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,880
I'll find you.

503
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,680
Lucy! We have to go right now.

504
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,600
It's okay.

505
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,720
- Lucy!
- What's this?

506
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,880
Okay... It's everything you need to know.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

507
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,200
Oh, I'm sorry...

508
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,680
This way.

509
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,840
- What do we do now?
- Shush.

510
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,200
- Gideon!
- Shut up!

511
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,680
They're gonna find us.

512
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,080
I can't let them take us alive.

513
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,760
No.

514
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,640
We have to reset, Lucy.

515
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,480
No, this is your fight, not mine.

516
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,320
I have a son.

517
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,920
I have a life, I can't...

518
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,440
Ravi's dead.

519
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,840
What?

520
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,960
Got them all out

521
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,400
but he couldn't save himself.

522
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,920
He's gone. I'm sorry.

523
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,400
You're lying.

524
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,080
- I wish I was.
- You're fucking lying!

525
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,696
- Armed police! Armed police!
- Drop your gun!

526
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,560
- No, no, no, don't. Lucy, don't.
- Put the weapon on the ground.

527
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,040
Don't shoot me. Please don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

528
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,440
I said drop the gun.

529
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,440
We have to reset while we still can.

530
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,760
No.

531
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,840
It's all right.

532
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,680
It's all right.

533
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,320
I've done this before.

534
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,600
You won't feel it.

535
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,960
You won't even hear the shot.

536
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,600
Drop the gun.

537
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,000
Stay perfectly still.

538
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,840
- Please.
- It has to be clean.

539
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

540
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,280
Close your eyes, count to three.

541
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,656
This is your last warning.

542
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,200
Count to three.

543
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,120
- No.
- Drop the weapon.

544
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,160
- One.
- Put the weapon on the ground.

545
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,240
- Two.
- Wait, what about Isa...
