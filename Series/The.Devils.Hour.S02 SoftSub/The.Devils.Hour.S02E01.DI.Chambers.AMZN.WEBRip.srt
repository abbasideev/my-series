1
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,720
<i>Déjà vu.</i>

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,696
<i>They say it's like
a short circuit in the brain.</i>

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,480
Jesus Christ!

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,120
<i>Your sense of a moment
plays through your memory centre,</i>

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,040
<i>makes you feel like
you've experienced all this before.</i>

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,280
My name's Lucy Chambers. I'm from
Children's Services. Can I come in?

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,120
If you don't open this door,
I'll fucking break it down!

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,040
Don't let him into this house.

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,080
<i>It's all connected.</i>

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,320
<i>Your dreams, your memories,</i>

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,320
<i>everything that happens,
everything that doesn't.</i>

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,680
I'm not supposed to be here.

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,200
Neither am I.

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,160
What makes you special, Gideon?

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,440
<i>I can remember the song,</i>

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,800
<i>and I can move the needle.</i>

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,640
<i>I've died more times than I can remember.</i>

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,720
<i>When I re-set,
all I have are my memories,</i>

19
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,920
<i>so I surround myself with every detail.</i>

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,680
<i>I learn the world's evils
like the lyrics of a song.</i>

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,760
<i>Whatever I do, wherever I go,</i>

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,960
someone always finds me eventually,
and it's always the same detective.

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,440
I am not your mummy.
I am an officer of the law!

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,400
Are you deaf or what?

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,960
Are you gonna calm down?

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,640
- How did you do that?
- I have no idea.

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,520
You said my life was different.
Different to what?

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,280
<i>I can help you remember.</i>

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,400
I stayed alive for you,
incarcerated, alone,

30
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,600
waiting for you to come back.

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,120
<i>You told me the worst thing
that ever happened to you.</i>

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,400
Thirty years ago, I stopped it.

33
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,440
<i>The last time we met,
you asked me to do this.</i>

34
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,040
You didn't realise how different
your life was going to be.

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,560
<i>You're not who you were.</i>

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,880
Lucy!

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,480
<i>Remember, Lucy, remember!</i>

38
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,560
Mummy?

39
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,680
Lucy.

40
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,520
You know the score.

41
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,240
I can't help you if you won't talk to me.

42
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,040
You know, when you first came here,
you didn't speak for a month,

43
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,640
so we used to make paper flowers...

44
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,720
in silence.

45
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,840
But I think you're a bit old for that now.

46
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,080
Why did you run away this time?

47
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,400
Where did you go?

48
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,000
Mum's cottage.

49
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,360
Why did you go there?

50
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,640
We used to keep letters in the fruit bowl.

51
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,480
Bills, birthday cards,

52
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,360
suicide notes.

53
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,800
I didn't wanna open it, so I hid it
where no one would ever find it.

54
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,760
What do you want it to say?

55
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,280
She didn't love me.

56
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,880
She didn't care about me.
She didn't want to be my mum anymore.

57
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,200
Why do you want it to say that?

58
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,240
Because then I can hate her,

59
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,640
and I never have
to think about her again.

60
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,200
Okay.

61
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,480
Well, I think if we're gonna do this,
we need to take a breath.

62
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,640
We need...

63
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,840
Fuck!

64
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,400
Fuck.

65
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,600
Fuck!

66
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,760
It's okay. I've got you.

67
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,880
I've got you. You're okay.

68
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,400
You're okay.

69
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,280
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

70
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,800
- Can I see some ID, please?
- No, I left it in the car.

71
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,280
Your date of birth?

72
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,120
5th December 19... 79.

73
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Too slow, try again. How old are you?

74
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,320
Eighteen.

75
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,640
- Why haven't you got any tits, then?
- Fuck off, yeah?

76
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,080
Look,
you're not gonna get served!

77
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,960
Oh, and you think you can do better?

78
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,080
Watch and learn.

79
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,400
Right. Are you
ready to tell me your name?

80
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,760
Okay, I'll go first.

81
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,720
I'm PC Holness.

82
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,080
You can call me Nick.

83
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,880
Nice to meet you, Nick.

84
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,120
Very good.
What part of Wales are you from?

85
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,600
That was really stupid
what you did in there.

86
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,760
Stealing cheap booze like that.

87
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,760
I mean, if you're not gonna pay for it,

88
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,960
you might as well treat yourself
to something decent.

89
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,080
Look, we don't have to go to the station.

90
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,960
Just tell me your name,
I'll drive you home,

91
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,176
have a word with your parents,
and that'll be the end of it.

92
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,120
- My parents are dead.
- Aye, right!

93
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,760
You go to school?

94
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,640
Not often.

95
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,960
Yeah, I used to skip a lot.

96
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,880
Now come on, where's home?

97
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,520
- Alright, cop shop it is then.
- Percy Street.

98
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,880
Percy Street?

99
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,000
Very nice.

100
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,200
Yeah, well,

101
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,400
my foster parents are posh cunts, so...

102
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,800
Aye.

103
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,360
There's a lot of posh cunts
in Percy Street.

104
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,040
Are they gonna be pissed off?

105
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,280
They'll probably kick me out.

106
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,960
I'll go somewhere else,
turn 18 in three months, so...

107
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,840
Alright, what happens then?

108
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,400
You know, you can't get
a decent job with a record?

109
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,160
What, a decent job, bit like yours?

110
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,400
Well, it's better to be
a cop than a robber.

111
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,200
It has its perks.

112
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,640
Bella likes your uniform, does she?

113
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,760
How do you know my wife's name?

114
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,600
That's her in the photo with the candles.

115
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,240
I reckon that's her name on the box.

116
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,560
Right. Come on.
No more messing around.

117
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,440
What's your name?

118
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,880
It's Lucy.

119
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,200
Lucy what?

120
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,880
Lucy Chambers.

121
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,840
Well, you've got a good eye for detail.

122
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,320
You'd make a better detective
than me, Lucy Chambers.

123
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,480
We don't have a burglar alarm.

124
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,120
I told Mike I thought we should get one.

125
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,520
You know, I've got some jewellery upstairs

126
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,760
and it's, well, it's quite expensive.

127
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,360
But you say that's all accounted for?

128
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,600
Didn't touch any of it.

129
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,720
We... we don't even think
that he went upstairs.

130
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,240
Maybe something spooked him,
a neighbour or the postman.

131
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,480
Yeah, but...

132
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,080
Mike left his iPad on the coffee table.

133
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,800
I mean, if you're gonna take one thing,
you would take that, right?

134
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,800
I'd have thought so.

135
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,280
Yeah, so why take the microwave?

136
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,640
Will he come back?

137
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,680
No. Don't worry. We'll catch him.

138
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,560
Yeah, alright, thanks, mate.

139
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,240
Er, just spoke to Ian next door, erm...

140
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,240
He reckons he saw
an old van parked down the road,

141
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,640
red Nissan, he reckons,
but there's no sign of it now.

142
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,640
A red Nissan. What model?

143
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,160
No idea, mate.

144
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,040
Are you okay, Joshy?
Are you okay, mate? Oh...

145
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,080
He's a bit shaken up.

146
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,920
He's worried the burglar's
gonna come back,

147
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,880
but he won't, will he, mate, hey?

148
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,800
Not with Daddy around, hey?

149
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,600
Actually if someone botches a burglary,
they do tend to come back for another go.

150
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,680
I'd suggest you get an alarm,
double locks on the doors.

151
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,920
Okay, mate. It's alright.

152
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,080
Wow. I'm guessing
you haven't got kids, then?

153
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay, mate. It's okay. You're safe now.

154
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,960
It's going to be okay.
Daddy's here, I'll protect you.

155
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,776
I mean, maybe don't say it
in front of the child.

156
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,720
Oh, God! I don't know why you
always get so soppy around kids.

157
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,240
- I don't get soppy.
- You do.

158
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,440
You'd be one of those
three-kids-and-a-mortgage people

159
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,160
with a dog and a ride-on mower
and a Citroën Berlingo.

160
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,840
And a wife, if I'm lucky.

161
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,240
Ugly wife. Short-sighted.
No sense of smell.

162
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,920
Oh! Bit out of my league.

163
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,480
I tell you what.

164
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,560
If we're both single
when we're 45, I'll marry you,

165
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,960
but we have to sleep in separate beds
and you will have to shave your beard.

166
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,200
Beards are sexy. This is a sexy beard.

167
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,320
No, it isn't, it's got crisps in it.

168
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,920
Did you ever hear about that weird case?

169
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,880
I think it was Dulworthy.

170
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,160
Someone broke in and didn't take
anything except a toy lion.

171
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,600
And the weirdest thing, a few months
later, they recalled those toys.

172
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,840
Loose eyes, choking hazard.

173
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,160
What the hell was that?

174
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,000
- Whoo!
- Weird time of day for fireworks.

175
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,440
So romantic, Ravi!

176
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,200
- Did you do all this for me?
- Oh, yeah.

177
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,160
I armed a bunch of farm kids
with some rockets, just for you.

178
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,360
What?

179
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,480
Nothing.

180
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,360
<i>♪ I am the one and only! ♪</i>

181
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,360
<i>♪ Nobody I'd rather be! ♪</i>

182
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,160
<i>♪ I am the one and only! ♪</i>

183
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,200
<i>♪ You can't take that away from me! ♪</i>

184
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,920
- There you go.
- No, no. On the house.

185
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,600
This woman saved my life. Seriously,
if it wasn't for her, I'd be homeless.

186
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,800
Yes, mate?

187
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,240
I arrested his landlord on drug charges.

188
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,800
Hard to chase up the rent
when you're in custody.

189
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,680
How do you drink this stuff?

190
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,120
Well, not like that.
Would you like some soda water?

191
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,440
Piss off.

192
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,720
Next round's my choice.

193
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,640
<i>♪ Away from me! ♪</i>

194
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,600
<i>♪ Ooh! ♪</i>

195
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,800
Oh!

196
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,576
There you go,
you're getting the hang of it.

197
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,560
No, I'm not.
This is gonna kill me tomorrow.

198
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,000
Hmm!

199
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,600
Mmm. Don't look.

200
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,800
- What?
- Don't look!

201
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,960
- Woman at the bar, sparkly top.
- What about her?

202
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,600
She's like totally checking you out.

203
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,560
No, she's not.

204
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,800
Buy her a drink.

205
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,760
What, and leave you on your own?

206
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,800
I'll hang out with Holness.

207
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,000
Bella's gonna kill him.

208
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,400
She will melt him down
and turn him into candles.

209
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,360
Lager-scented candles.

210
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,640
- You'll have to make the arrest.
- Bella Holness?

211
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,000
I think we'd need a SWAT team.

212
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,320
Ow!

213
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
What?

214
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,000
She's still looking.

215
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,000
Go on!

216
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,440
Fine.

217
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,400
<i>♪ Hey, there you, with the sad face ♪</i>

218
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,920
<i>♪ Come up to my place and live it up ♪</i>

219
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,800
<i>♪ You, beside the dance floor ♪</i>

220
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,080
<i>♪ What do you cry for, let's live it up ♪</i>

221
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,080
Fucking bastard!

222
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,320
Hey! Who fucking put that there?

223
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,960
Oh! There she is.

224
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,400
You know, your fancy man's
inside there talking to some bimbo.

225
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,680
He's not my fancy man.
He's my partner, Nick.

226
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,000
Is that why you're sulking out here?

227
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,800
I'm not sulking, I'm thinking.

228
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,720
Alright, suit yourself.

229
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,520
I'm gonna throw up and find myself a taxi.

230
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,240
Oh, give my love to Bella.

231
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,400
I will.

232
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,920
Don't know if she'll be
in a lovely mood, though.

233
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,280
Then again, you never know.

234
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,320
Goodnight, DI Chambers.

235
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,800
Goodnight, lover boy!

236
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,920
Who you calling lover boy?

237
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,400
What's her name?

238
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,800
Elena.

239
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,200
She's a school teacher.

240
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,400
Very wholesome.

241
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,000
What's on your mind, Chambers?

242
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,800
Toy lions and microwaves.

243
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,720
Somewhere in the noise,
there's always a pattern.

244
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,320
- What?
- Give yourself an evening off.

245
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,280
You let this stuff consume you.

246
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,760
This is the job, Ravi.

247
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,080
Amanda Milton and Margo Jackson
were last seen walking home from school

248
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,280
in the Tamford area at approximately
5:00 pm yesterday afternoon.

249
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,080
The nature of their disappearance
is not yet known,

250
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,320
but our response has been
swift and uncompromising.

251
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,320
We are coordinating with Hackridge Police

252
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,080
to ensure that no stone is left unturned,

253
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,800
and we are urging any members of
the public with relevant information

254
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,760
to come forward
and assist us in our enquiries.

255
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,560
Let's find these girls
and bring them home.

256
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,080
Oh, come on!

257
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,920
Argh! God!

258
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,720
- Argh! Oh!
- They don't have any Coke round here.

259
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,520
Oh...

260
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,080
What did you find?

261
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Did you ever speak to Holness
about the Jonah Taylor case?

262
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,560
Tried to. He's not exactly forthcoming.

263
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,240
There was traffic cam footage
from the end of the Taylor's road.

264
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,680
Several houses on the route,
only one vehicle unaccounted for.

265
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,200
A red Nissan Vanette.

266
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,920
Yeah, I remember.
They never tracked it down.

267
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,240
No, they didn't.

268
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,240
But this...

269
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,080
this was taken three days before
Amanda and Margo went missing.

270
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,560
It's a doorbell cam three streets away.

271
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,720
They always take the same
route home from school.

272
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,000
Now tell me, Ravi,

273
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,800
is that or is that not
a red Nissan Vanette?

274
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,720
Might be coincidence.

275
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,320
That car's at least 20 years old.
It's not a fucking coincidence.

276
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,800
Have you got a cigarette?

277
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,800
- You're not supposed to smoke in here.
- I'll open a window.

278
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,480
DS Dhillon.

279
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,040
Say that again, please.

280
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,200
What is it?

281
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,120
Okay, tell them
we'll be there in ten minutes.

282
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,440
Have they found them?

283
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,160
It's something else.

284
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,480
- Stay outside.
- I can handle it.

285
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,200
It's a kid, Ravi.

286
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,400
I can't have you plugged in,
not in there.

287
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,080
Stay out here, find out what we know.

288
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,320
Ladies and gents,
step back, please. Back.

289
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,360
<i>Husband had a record.</i>

290
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,200
On probation for assault.

291
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,240
Neighbour said he was pounding
on the back door till she let him in.

292
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,080
- Where is he now?
- No clue.

293
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,640
We put out an APW.

294
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,000
Conscientious neighbours.

295
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,000
Anyone see him leave?

296
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
Shane.

297
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,200
It's Shane, isn't it?

298
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,720
Shane, I need you to put down the knife.

299
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,320
I have Fisher.

300
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,920
Upstairs bathroom.

301
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,320
<i>Say again.</i>

302
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,280
Fuck!

303
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,520
No!

304
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,056
- Stand still!
- Stop resisting!

305
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,080
Fuck!

306
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,560
Put them on!

307
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,400
Right, get in.

308
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,040
Head down.

309
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,640
Let me see.

310
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,440
No, you'll faint.

311
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,800
I'll be brave.

312
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
- Does it hurt?
- Ah!

313
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,080
Only when I laugh.

314
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,560
House hasn't fallen down yet,
so that's something.

315
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,000
- It's not a supporting wall.
- We'll see.

316
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,560
Nah, it looks great, babe.

317
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,440
Cheers.

318
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,160
- Start on the attic tomorrow.
- You're not serious?

319
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,520
What?

320
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,760
Can't you sit still for one minute?

321
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,720
What do you think I'm doing now?

322
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,600
What is it, love?

323
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,720
We don't have time for this.

324
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,640
It's someone's little boy.

325
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,160
I thought it might be nice
to find a kid for a change.

326
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,400
And no one's reported him missing?

327
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,120
Not yet.

328
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Okay.

329
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,880
I still think you should have
gone for the gold one.

330
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,440
Here we go.

331
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,200
He's just up here.

332
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,800
Hello there.

333
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,560
My name's Ravi. What's yours?

334
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,160
Isaac.

335
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,480
Nice to meet you, Isaac.

336
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,760
This is my friend Lucy.

337
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,800
We're here to help you get home, okay?

338
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,360
He thinks this is his home.

339
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,320
Isaac.

340
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,640
- What's your mummy's name?
- Lucy.

341
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,800
Do you know her second name?

342
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,120
Chambers.

343
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,080
And do you know where Mummy is?

344
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,640
No, sweetheart.
I'm not your mummy.

345
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,640
No, I'm not, and we need to find her

346
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,920
'cause your mummy is gonna be
very worried about you.

347
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,920
You're my mummy.

348
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,880
No, I'm not Mummy.

349
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:49,880
Maybe... I look like Mummy.
Does she have hair like mine?

350
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,760
It's different.

351
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,640
Different how?

352
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,000
Oh... sweetheart.

353
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,040
Hey, don't get upset.

354
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,840
It's alright.

355
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,720
It's okay to cry if it hurts.

356
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,120
Sometimes crying makes it feel better.

357
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,720
What do we do?

358
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,360
- Er, I don't know.
- Well, someone must be missing him.

359
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,280
He can't just have
appeared out of thin air.

360
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,480
We'll call Children's Services, yeah?

361
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,520
Find him somewhere to stay.

362
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,680
No...

363
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,360
Isaac. You just...
You just need to stay here.

364
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,160
No, we're taking him back to the station.

365
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,480
Yeah, sounds good. How long?

366
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,440
Because we're not babysitters.

367
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,200
Sorry, what did you say your name was?

368
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,320
No, don't put me on hold.
Don't you...

369
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,480
Oh!

370
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,880
- Gotta love Children's Services.
- Helpful as ever?

371
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,640
Rob Shaw. Remember that name.

372
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,840
Prick.

373
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,000
Sorry.

374
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,400
I don't know what we do when we
get there. He's not gonna let me go.

375
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,320
- What do you think happened to him?
- I've no idea.

376
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,320
It's weird that no one's reported it.

377
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,480
Do you think someone abandoned him?

378
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
No.

379
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,080
- Who would do that?
- Someone who can't cope anymore.

380
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,520
Just leave him with another family.

381
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,000
It's possible.

382
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,520
You okay?

383
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,200
Yeah.
My arm's gone to sleep.

384
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,520
Come on, sweetheart. Let's swap.

385
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,680
Weird day.

386
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,240
Oh, you need to take the next left.

387
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,080
DI Chambers.

388
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,680
What?

389
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,680
What is it?

390
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,320
You need to turn around.

391
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,320
- What?
- Just turn around.

392
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,120
Stay here.

393
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,480
I'll find someone to take
the kid back to the station.

394
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,920
Do you think it's them?

395
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,040
Keep the door locked.

396
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,920
It's okay.

397
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,400
She's coming back. You'll be okay.

398
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,560
How about we listen to some music?

399
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,960
Would you like that?

400
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,800
She won't be long.

401
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,880
Looks like someone tried to weigh
them down, but the knot slipped.

402
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,080
There's a boat shop down the road.

403
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,800
Owner says he saw a van parked
out here the last few nights.

404
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,480
What sort of van?

405
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,600
Red. Doesn't know the make.

406
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,000
Might not be connected.

407
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,800
Everything's connected.

408
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,680
Isaac!

409
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,960
Isaac?

410
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,920
I took my eyes off him for one second.

411
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,761
- It's like he just disappeared.
- Kids don't just disappear, do they?

412
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,840
There's nowhere to hide.
I've searched everywhere.

413
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,520
What about in there?

414
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,000
It's locked.

415
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,960
So?

416
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,760
Can I help you?

417
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,160
Anything else you want to add?

418
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,640
It might help if you take us
through it again.

419
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,320
You know, get everything straight.

420
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,480
No.

421
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,040
Fine.

422
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:55,000
Interview with Harold Slade
terminated at 17:32.

423
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,040
- That make any sense to you?
- Only just got here, catch me up.

424
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,520
He didn't wanna hurt them.
He just wanted to...

425
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,920
keep them.

426
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,080
Sorry, Sam Boyd.

427
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,800
DC Boyd just transferred in from the Met.

428
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,040
What do you mean,
he wanted to keep them?

429
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,680
Well, he says it wasn't, erm, sexual.

430
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,160
Not sexual?

431
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,160
The key to that door was in his safe,

432
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,960
and we found
child pornography on his laptop.

433
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,600
What the fuck
did he do to them, Nick?

434
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,160
Nothing, according to him.

435
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,680
Then how did they die?

436
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,480
He's a big Tchaikovsky fan.

437
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,960
His wife surprised him
with a trip to Prague. Swan Lake.

438
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,600
Packed his case for him,
no time to double back for the kids.

439
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,640
Left them without food or water.

440
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,840
So, by the time they got back...

441
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:02,040
We're following up with the coroner,
but the theory is they died of...

442
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,320
thirst.

443
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,400
Oh, my...

444
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,200
He should have killed himself.

445
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,880
What made him turn himself in?

446
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,200
He was threatened.

447
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,176
Somebody saw him trying
to get rid of the bodies,

448
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,400
cornered him in the dark,
held a knife to his throat.

449
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,640
We're looking for a Caucasian male.

450
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,360
Tall, thin, Scottish accent, grey hair.

451
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,160
Cloven hooves, big old horns.

452
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,880
Slade said he was the devil
come to take him to hell.

453
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,160
This man said he could
see into the future.

454
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,000
Knew exactly when and where
those girls would be found.

455
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,840
- Right, so the devil made him do it?
- No, no, no.

456
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,880
- The devil made him confess.
- Sorry, erm...

457
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,560
You tied a red Vanette to the abduction?

458
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,480
Right, erm...

459
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,400
But it's...
it was just he was quite specific.

460
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,296
Specific doesn't mean
he's right in the head.

461
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,760
The guy's a fucking nut job.

462
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,160
No, no, I know but...

463
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,320
Well, it can't be a coincidence.

464
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,960
Guess what sort of car the devil drives?

465
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,800
Argh!

466
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,160
Name's Aiden Stenner.

467
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,200
Multiple stab wounds. Dead on arrival.

468
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,360
You see, they join these gangs and...

469
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,160
Well, it's just a matter of time.

470
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,520
You alright, mate?

471
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,880
Yeah, I'm fine.

472
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,360
- Do you wanna step outside for a minute?
- No.

473
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,160
It's not a gang attack.

474
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,680
How do you know?

475
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,600
Witnesses described
a thin man in his fifties or sixties,

476
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,200
white hair, Scottish accent.

477
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,400
They haven't seen him
around here before.

478
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,640
Get a statement from those kids.
I want an E-Fit for the suspect.

479
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,280
Put out an APW and check the CCTV
coverage on the buildings opposite

480
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,760
and every traffic cam
in a ten-mile radius.

481
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,320
We're not gonna
get a chance like this again.

482
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,560
<i>Slade said he was the devil
come to take him to hell.</i>

483
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,760
<i>There was traffic cam footage
from the end of the Taylor's road.</i>

484
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,280
<i>Several houses on the route,
but only one vehicle unaccounted for.</i>

485
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,520
<i>A red Nissan Vanette.</i>

486
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,960
<i>Yeah, I remember.
They never tracked it down.</i>

487
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,840
<i>Everything's connected.
But it can't be a coincidence.</i>

488
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,520
<i>Is that or is that not
a red Nissan Vanette?</i>

489
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,600
<i>Cloven hooves, big old horns.</i>

490
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,600
<i>We're looking for
a Caucasian male,</i>

491
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:55,080
<i>tall, thin, Scottish accent, grey hair.</i>

492
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,400
<i>Guess what sort of car the devil drives?</i>

493
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,800
<i>We've found a link
between multiple cases</i>

494
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,520
dating right back to the Jonah Taylor
abduction 12 years ago.

495
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:12,360
Sightings of a red Nissan Vanette,
which has, until now, never been traced.

496
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,680
We've cross-referenced past sightings
of the vehicle with recent ANPR hits.

497
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,480
Seems it always disappears
around the same black spot,

498
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,000
Thornham Green.

499
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,320
It's mostly farmland, single track lane.

500
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,000
Now, surveillance drones didn't
pick it up, but we did find this.

501
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,800
Used to be a holiday let.

502
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,520
The owner died some time ago.

503
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,760
No one claimed it.
It's supposed to be empty.

504
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,120
Thermal imaging tells a different story.

505
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:45,040
Working theory, this is
where our suspect is hiding.

506
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,720
Now, he is extremely resourceful

507
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,960
and quite possibly armed.

508
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,280
TFCs will brief firearms officers
on the finer details,

509
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,920
but we go in at night,

510
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,920
quiet, set up roadblocks.

511
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,800
Take him by surprise.

512
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,440
<i>ETA to target, 30 seconds.</i>

513
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,480
<i>We believe suspect is still in situ.</i>

514
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,160
<i>Proceed as planned on arrival.</i>

515
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,080
Clear!

516
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,160
Requesting medical support.

517
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,720
All clear! Suspect isn't here.

518
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,480
All units move in.

519
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,056
- Let's bring in aerial support.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

520
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,520
Sierra, Oscar, 43, control.

521
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,720
Any sign of the suspect?

522
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,880
Sierra, Oscar, 43, control.

523
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,360
This is DS Dhillon, request...

524
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,600
Stop there, please.

525
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,200
I said, stop there!

526
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,360
Is that you, Dhillon?

527
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,920
Are we really gonna do this again?

528
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,240
I would tell you to walk away
but I know that you won't.

529
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,560
Stop right there! Hands above your head!

530
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,960
You can't beat me.
I know every move you're gonna make.

531
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,480
Just let me pass.

532
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,800
I can't do that.

533
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,200
Alright.

534
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,600
Let's get it over with.

535
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,000
Don't come any closer.

536
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,200
I said stop!

537
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,240
Get a closer look at it.

538
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,880
Yeah, it's definitely it.

539
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,560
Get the plates as well.

540
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,480
He left on foot.

541
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,600
Tracks heed off in every direction.

542
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,040
This is petrol.

543
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,480
Ma'am?

544
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,480
Well, that thing runs on diesel.

545
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,600
So does the generator.

546
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,840
That means he's got another vehicle.

547
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,200
There's only one set of tyre tracks.

548
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,400
So he slips away on foot.

549
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,800
Keeps a back-up close to the main road.

550
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,920
Get me a map of the area.

551
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,920
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

552
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,520
- Let's move!
- I said move.

553
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,000
Armed police!

554
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,320
Armed police!

555
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,280
<i>DI Chambers, come in.</i>

556
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,320
Go ahead.

557
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,560
<i>We're a man down.</i>

558
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,360
Can he hear me?

559
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,880
It's hard to say.

560
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,680
Sleep it off, yeah?

561
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,360
It's over now.

562
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,160
We got him.

563
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,400
We fucking got him.

564
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,200
They haven't fed me.

565
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,360
Good.

566
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,480
This is DI Lucy Chambers
of the Hart Valley Constabulary.

567
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,800
It is the 11th of November.
The time is 21:42.

568
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,080
Would you state your full name
for the benefit of the recording?

569
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,800
Gideon Shepherd.

570
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,440
Mr Shepherd, you've been arrested

571
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,000
for the murders of Aiden Stenner
and Connor Larson.

572
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,680
Is that it?

573
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,680
How many people have you
killed, Mr Shepherd?

574
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,480
More.

575
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,840
Do you know how many times we've
had this conversation, DI Chambers?

576
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,040
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Existence is a circle, recurring,

577
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,240
and in every recurrence,

578
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,600
you and I sit in this room.

579
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,040
You ask me your questions,
I tell you the truth,

580
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,120
and I warn you what's gonna
happen if you don't believe me.

581
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,080
What is going to happen, Mr Shepherd?

582
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,880
You've read my notes.

583
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,280
Tried to.

584
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,160
You need to work on your handwriting.

585
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,600
So you keep telling me, detective.

586
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,720
What is going to happen, Mr Shepherd?

587
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,240
Seventeen dead.

588
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,320
Eleven children.

589
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,840
I can't stop it now, but you can.

590
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,920
- What have you done?
- Not me.

591
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,360
I'm not what you think I am.

592
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,600
You look at me and you see
the devil incarnate.

593
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,160
The real devil's out there,

594
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,080
lurking in the shadows.

595
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,280
The blur on the edge of the picture.

596
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,680
I don't know his face, but I've seen
what he can do, and so will you.

597
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,080
Next year, 17 dead, 11 children.

598
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,760
Mr Shepherd, I'm going to...

599
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,000
...refer you
for psychological evaluation.

600
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,200
I go to prison. I kill myself.

601
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,040
We start over.

602
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,200
But we always end up here, every time.

603
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,240
I can't beat you, Lucy.

604
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,800
So I want you to join me.

605
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,320
Join you?

606
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,320
I'll live, just this once.

607
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,360
I'll stay alive.

608
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,720
I'll serve my time and wait.

609
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,600
When you're ready to talk,
you'll know where to find me.

610
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,760
Until then...

611
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,800
I've said all I have to say.

612
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,720
You know, silence won't help your defence.

613
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,000
No comment.

614
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,600
DI Chambers.

615
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,040
<i>- Ma'am. It's DC Boyd.</i>
- Go ahead, Boyd.

616
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,280
<i>I'm just checking the CID logs.</i>

617
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,040
<i>A 999 call came through
about five minutes ago.</i>

618
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,120
<i>House fire at 7 Sycamore Drive.</i>

619
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,080
- Why are you telling me this?
<i>- It's just...</i>

620
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,720
<i>you've been there, ma'am, last month.</i>

621
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,440
<i>It's the house where
they found that boy, Isaac.</i>

622
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,640
Detective Chambers.

623
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,880
Did we get everyone out?

624
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,240
Looks that way.

625
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,520
They're treating the mother for burns.

626
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,920
Is everything alright, ma'am?

627
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,680
It's nothing, just a feeling.

628
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,720
Déjà vu.

629
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,840
Isaac?

630
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,560
Isaac, are you in there?

631
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,160
It's Lucy.

632
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,640
Lucy Chambers. Will you come out, Isaac?
We're not supposed to be here.

633
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,320
Daddy made me cold.

634
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,720
There's nothing to be afraid of.

635
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,360
I couldn't stop it.

636
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,960
What couldn't you stop?

637
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,760
The fire.

638
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,920
Oh, sweetheart,
you don't have to stop the fire.

639
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,080
Everyone's okay.
The firemen are putting it out.

640
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,600
It followed me here.

641
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,040
What do you mean?

642
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,720
Isaac?

643
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,800
What time is it?

644
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,560
Late.

645
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,680
I'm surprised they let you in.

646
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,240
Perks of the job.

647
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,760
I said I had to speak to my partner,

648
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,240
urgent police business.

649
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,680
Oh, lucky me.

650
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,800
Yeah, I lied.

651
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,280
I just wanted to be with... someone.

652
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,280
Are you okay?

653
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,200
No.

654
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,440
No, I think I might be losing my mind.

655
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,720
Me too.

656
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,760
We can go crazy together.

657
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,520
I'd like that.

658
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,560
Does it hurt?

659
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,920
It's not so bad.

660
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,160
Good.

661
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,280
<i>I know.</i>

662
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,560
<i>I'm insane for being here.</i>

663
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,080
<i>This might be my last chance.</i>

664
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,320
I'm running out of time.

665
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,960
No, you're not.

666
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,800
You and I have all the time
in the world, detective.

667
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,600
You will return to this life
just as I will,

668
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,240
just as we always have.

669
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,440
Only next time,
we make sure it's different.

670
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,480
How much will it change?

671
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,040
I can't say for sure.

672
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,560
A butterfly flaps its wings
and greets a thunderstorm.

673
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:18,120
I can save your mother's life,
but after that, we surrender to the chaos

674
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,640
and the chaos will wake you up,

675
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,760
make you remember this conversation.

676
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,080
So if we do this,

677
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:31,240
if you stop my mother
from killing herself,

678
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,560
I lose everything.

679
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,040
You'll lose, you'll gain.
You'll walk a different path.

680
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,720
I'll forget him.

681
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,800
You were always going to,

682
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,040
but if you wake up,
we can save them all.

683
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,560
- I shouldn't be here.
- Yes, you should.

684
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,280
Lucy.

685
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,120
You know this case.

686
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,680
Every foul detail, it's etched
into your soul, I know it is.

687
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,600
Not just Rigby's, but the others.
The schools, the soft play.

688
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,320
Wrap it up.

689
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,680
We have to stop them, Lucy.

690
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I need you on my side.

691
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,400
Okay.

692
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,600
Okay.

693
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,080
Are you okay?

694
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,640
It's okay.

695
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,680
Someone help!

696
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,040
- What's wrong?
- Call an ambulance!

697
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,680
It's okay.

698
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,040
You're gonna be okay.

699
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,000
Ravi.

700
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,840
I'm here.

701
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,360
Can I get you anything?

702
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,080
Don't let go.

703
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,600
I only ever needed you.

704
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,080
You know that, don't you?

705
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,080
Come on, Chambers.

706
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,680
I think you're hamming this up a bit.

707
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,240
You made me so happy.

708
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,880
We'll see each other again.

709
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,440
I promise.

710
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,640
I will find you.

711
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,880
I love you, Lucy Chambers.

712
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,080
Ravi.

713
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,240
I'm here.

714
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,760
I can hear music.

715
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,600
<i>So if we do this,
I lose everything.</i>

716
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,240
<i>You'll lose, you'll gain.
You'll walk a different path.</i>

717
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,800
<i>Our dreams can't hurt us, Lucy.</i>

718
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,920
<i>Can't hurt us now.</i>

719
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,640
<i>Still nothing.</i>

720
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:24,240
<i>He never cries,
never laughs, he never gets mad.</i>

721
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,760
He's just...

722
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,920
Isaac!

723
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,080
Isaac!

724
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,000
Coming through.

725
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,400
- Don't try to speak.
- Isaac.

726
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,160
- He's okay.
- Where is he?

727
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,720
- He's okay. He's being looked after.
- Did he get out?

728
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,920
He got out.
Your neighbours found him.

729
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,320
Is Ravi here?

730
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,320
- Ravi?
- Ravi...

731
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,200
Ravi. Ravi Dhillon, my husband.

732
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,160
Lucy.

733
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,560
Do you remember what happened?

734
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,160
I remember.

735
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:31,280
I remember everything.
