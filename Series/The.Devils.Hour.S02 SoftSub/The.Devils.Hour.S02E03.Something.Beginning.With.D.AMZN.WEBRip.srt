1
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,600
Nothing from ANPR.

2
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,360
The traffic cams picked it up
twice on New Park Road,

3
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,960
10:38, heading west
towards the high street,

4
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,160
11:07, coming back the other way.

5
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,360
Timing's fit the bombing at the toy shop.

6
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,680
Makes sense he'd use a stolen car.

7
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,680
- Do we know when it was stolen?
- No.

8
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,720
The owner's a Jack Graham,
22, trust fund kid.

9
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,280
Got pissed and jumped off a wall.

10
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,720
Someone nicked the car when
he was having his legs put back together,

11
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,880
sometime over the past eight days.

12
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,040
Well, canvas his neighbourhood.
This can't be a coincidence.

13
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,960
Find the thief, find the bomber.

14
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,400
It's a bit flash for
a getaway car though, isn't it?

15
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,160
You read the profile. He's on autopilot.

16
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,880
Invincible.
Thinks he can do what he likes.

17
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,000
No point sweeping for fibres.
It's all ashes in there.

18
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,840
But we found a footprint.
Size ten, trainer, wide fit.

19
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,840
Great. That narrows it down.

20
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,960
We could appeal for more information.

21
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,760
Blue Subaru, yellow hoodie. Might jog
someone's memory. Someone might know him.

22
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Or he's a recluse. Lives in
the middle of nowhere, cut off.

23
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,800
Faceless.

24
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,880
Yeah, but could be worth a try though.

25
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,720
Worth a try. Thanks, Boyd.

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,680
Bye.

27
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,600
Think she'll find anything?

28
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
No.

29
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,560
Not in this lifetime.

30
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,520
Fuck!

31
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,240
Fuck!

32
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Fuck!

33
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,480
Fuck!

34
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,320
Fuck, it's alright.

35
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,480
You're just having a bad dream.

36
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,960
We both are.

37
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,720
Just...

38
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,160
Let's go in...

39
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,280
Let's go inside, right?

40
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,800
That's it. Jesus.

41
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,360
Sit there. Don't move.

42
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,560
I'll find you a blanket.

43
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,200
Who... Who is it?

44
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Who...

45
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,160
Who is that?

46
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,680
Just a spill.

47
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,320
An echo.

48
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,240
He's not here.

49
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,560
Are we?

50
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,880
These...

51
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,240
are my memories.

52
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,680
Taken from where they were supposed to be.

53
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,720
Lifted out of their continuity.

54
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,280
Sometimes...

55
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,160
when I'm slipping,

56
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,280
when the chaos pushes back,

57
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,920
they seem to disappear.

58
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,880
The tin seems empty.

59
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,320
But it's not empty.

60
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,760
And neither are you.

61
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,280
I always bury this tin
somewhere no one will ever find it.

62
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,600
It's my fail-safe.

63
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,320
My anchor.

64
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,640
What did you bury out there, Sylvia?

65
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,840
What were you digging for?

66
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,520
Hello?

67
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,200
Hi, Mum.

68
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,480
Nothing yet.

69
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,720
He's coming, soon.

70
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,640
The owner's in hospital. I checked,
two broken ankles, no deviations.

71
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,200
He's on the same path.

72
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
Good.

73
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,520
Mum?

74
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,480
You alright? Did you say something?

75
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,520
I found her out in the garden last night.

76
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,160
She'd wandered out.

77
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,520
About half-three.

78
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,040
What was she doing?

79
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,120
Digging.

80
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,400
She buried something out there
a long time ago.

81
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,880
What?

82
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,840
A memory.

83
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,240
A useful one.

84
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,200
It's in the bag.

85
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,680
I sawed off the barrel.
It's easier to conceal.

86
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,120
You said that she wouldn't be a problem.

87
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,880
And she won't. Just lock the door.
Make sure she doesn't leave.

88
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,760
Oh, come on, Gideon.

89
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,120
If she stays here, you have
to do something for me.

90
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,120
Right.

91
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,280
They're offering a reward for my arrest.

92
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,920
And we've got four days
to find the bomber.

93
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,000
If I get my face in front of
the wrong camera, then this is all over.

94
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,600
It means I can't leave here,
not until we're sure.

95
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,960
You want me to play detective?

96
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,800
Pick up where you left off.
Find the thief.

97
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,760
Find the bomber.

98
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,040
Lucy?

99
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,640
Yeah, you're asking me
to spy on a mass murderer.

100
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
I'm just...

101
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,160
It might be more than spying.

102
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,760
You'll need to protect yourself.

103
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,720
<i>"Make your choice,
adventurous stranger.</i>

104
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,920
Strike the bell and bide the danger.

105
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,840
Or wonder till it drives you mad.

106
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,320
What would have followed if you had."

107
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,120
Right, I need to make dinner.

108
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,720
Two more pages.

109
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
One. But it's your turn to read.

110
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,760
What's this?

111
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,760
Meredith did it for me.

112
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,120
She said it was okay
because it's not forever.

113
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,040
You can have one too.

114
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,400
She showed me how.

115
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,080
<i>Now we have to wait.</i>

116
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,000
How long?

117
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,440
Thirty seconds.

118
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,160
Oh? Is that all?

119
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,440
How many did she give you?

120
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,640
Seven, for when they rub off.

121
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,280
You're happy.

122
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,600
Is that 'cause Meredith's your girlfriend?

123
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,280
- She's not my girlfriend.
- No, I know, I know.

124
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,680
She's... She's your friend.

125
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,560
Maybe a best friend?

126
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,080
You're my best friend.

127
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,280
Hmm.

128
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,120
<i>Strange, but real.</i>

129
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,160
<i>Unexplained phenomena,</i>

130
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,800
<i>paranormal events.</i>

131
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,680
<i>These are the true stories
that never made the headlines.</i>

132
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,120
<i>Too disturbing for the public eye.</i>

133
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,600
<i>Join us tonight as we attempt
to solve</i> The Unsolvables.

134
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,960
- What is this?
- Just keep watching.

135
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,600
Keep an open mind.

136
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,280
<i>Reincarnation.</i>

137
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,040
<i>For centuries, mankind has pondered
the question... Is there life after death?</i>

138
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,440
<i>Perhaps the answer lies in science.</i>

139
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,680
<i>Perhaps it lies in religion,
or perhaps it lies in a family home</i>

140
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,880
<i>on a quiet street in
the market town of Hackridge.</i>

141
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,720
<i>Evelyn Wiseman
began life as a happy baby,</i>

142
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,560
<i>a bright and inquisitive toddler.</i>

143
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,920
<i>But not long after
she began to speak in full sentences,</i>

144
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,800
<i>her parents realised
that something was wrong.</i>

145
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,480
<i>She started talking
about things she remembered.</i>

146
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,080
<i>Things that hadn't happened yet.</i>

147
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,640
<i>We thought, "Well, that's nothing.
That's just kids, isn't it? Imagination."</i>

148
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,320
<i>What are you drawing, Evelyn?</i>

149
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,480
<i>- What's it supposed to be?
- Death.</i>

150
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,880
<i>When she was three, she'd ask
if she could play with the pink house.</i>

151
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,040
<i>We'd say, "What pink house?
There is no pink house."</i>

152
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,760
<i>Then one day the neighbours
were having a clear out</i>

153
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,200
<i>and they brought round
this pink doll's house.</i>

154
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,160
<i>And her face lit up, and she said,
"There it is. There it is."</i>

155
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
<i>That was two years later.</i>

156
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,280
<i>We'd moved to a different town.</i>

157
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,760
<i>From an early age,
Evelyn would talk about leaving,</i>

158
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,640
<i>complaining that she wasn't
where she was supposed to be.</i>

159
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,560
<i>That they were all supposed to die in
a car crash on the 5th September, 1977.</i>

160
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,320
That is the date
that Shepherd mentioned on the tapes.

161
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,880
The exact date.

162
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,280
Where did this come from?

163
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,400
I... I was Googling anything
connecting the name Evelyn

164
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,160
with recurrence,
reincarnation, time loops.

165
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,720
Look, maybe we can track down the family,

166
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,320
get some answers.

167
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,120
What I wanna know is,

168
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,080
where did Lucy Chambers
get the name from?

169
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,480
Maybe she went down
the same rabbit hole you did.

170
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,560
Look, I know you want to trust her.

171
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,640
I want to. Doesn't mean I do.

172
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,680
Then bring her in for questioning.

173
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,656
- Not until we've got something more solid.
- But...

174
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,040
I accuse Lucy, she goes on the defensive.

175
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,680
Better to keep things friendly.

176
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,800
How friendly?

177
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,080
Look, I'm sorry, Ravi, but this
is dangerous. She is a suspect.

178
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,080
No, she isn't. She's a person of interest.

179
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,480
Right. Right.

180
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,841
So that's why you're spending
so much time with her, yeah?

181
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,480
Out of interest?

182
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,280
What happens if someone finds out?

183
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,240
They'll only find out if you tell them.

184
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,880
And she's not dangerous.

185
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,640
Hold it tight against your hip.

186
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
You don't want to sprain your wrist.

187
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Here.

188
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,600
Once it's loaded, it's going off.

189
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,080
Don't point it at anything
you don't want to die.

190
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,600
I don't want anyone to die.

191
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,120
That's not how it works.
It's him or his victims.

192
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,280
Try again. Tight to the hip.

193
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,280
I'm pregnant.

194
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,560
Are you sure?

195
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,280
It's very unlikely.

196
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,000
And yet, here we are.

197
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
- Do you know who?
- Ravi.

198
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,920
Does he know?

199
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,080
Not yet.

200
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,800
I can't go to prison.

201
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,880
I did.

202
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,080
Twenty-five years.

203
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,080
That's how long you kept me waiting.

204
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,320
Waiting for this,
this chance, this reckoning.

205
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,680
It's what you asked for,
it's what I gave you.

206
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,320
That wasn't me. She wasn't me.

207
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,560
She didn't have a mother.
She didn't have a son.

208
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,560
Some nights, I wonder if I'm going insane
and then I think, "No, no."

209
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,240
People who are insane
don't know they're insane,

210
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,200
so I stop wondering and I tell myself
that I'm doing the right thing.

211
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,880
That I'm not crazy.
Which is exactly what crazy people do.

212
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,760
So then...

213
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,240
I wonder if I'm crazy again,

214
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,200
and then it just goes round
and round in circles until I fall asleep,

215
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,080
and I dream about
everyone who's gonna die.

216
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,720
I don't know exactly
what's gonna happen next,

217
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,080
but I know that you're not
going to run away from this.

218
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,800
What makes you say that?

219
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,040
Because that's not who you are.

220
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,080
Got you.

221
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,400
This is a very good poem, Isaac.

222
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,080
Excellent handwriting, perfect spelling.

223
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,520
Did anyone help you with it?

224
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,680
Where did you get the idea from?

225
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,920
I thought of it.

226
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,040
What, you thought of it all on your own?

227
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,280
It wasn't something you saw on the telly,

228
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,240
or something you heard
a grown-up talking about?

229
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,160
Mum knows about it.

230
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,560
"The Devil's Hour".

231
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,480
What is the Devil's Hour, Isaac?

232
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,320
It's late at night.

233
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,880
When we have bad dreams.

234
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,960
When we get scared.

235
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,040
And do you often have bad dreams?

236
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,080
And things... things always
seem scarier at night, don't they?

237
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,000
Sometimes it happens in the day.

238
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,320
What do you mean?

239
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,200
I'm not allowed to talk about it.

240
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,560
You're always allowed to talk to me.

241
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,440
Is it a secret?

242
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,160
It's not a secret
if you tell people it's a secret.

243
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,240
That's what Mum says.

244
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,000
And does Mummy have a lot of secrets?

245
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Isaac,

246
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,840
if Mummy's secrets make you sad or afraid,

247
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,280
then it's better you don't keep them.

248
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,880
Do you understand?

249
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,520
I'm always here if you need me.

250
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,880
Can I go and play now?

251
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,720
'Course.

252
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,160
Sorry. Thanks for coming to speak with me.

253
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,560
You're welcome.

254
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,240
This looks like a good spot
for some pictures, what do you reckon?

255
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,760
Yeah, come on.
Let's find some nice birds.

256
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,720
I don't feel well.

257
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,320
Erm, we'll...
we'll find another park, okay?

258
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,960
Mum?

259
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Yeah.

260
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,880
We should go away.

261
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,600
Somewhere hot and too expensive.

262
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,800
Ravi?

263
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,000
Hmm?

264
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,040
You're talking in your sleep.

265
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,720
I'm sorry.

266
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,680
I was dreaming.

267
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,600
What about?

268
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,680
I don't know.

269
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,120
What time is it?

270
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,440
It's late.

271
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,760
Go back to sleep.

272
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,720
Shit.

273
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,640
Make it quick. Everyone's asleep.

274
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,680
<i>Not everyone. It's started.</i>

275
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,800
Our blue Subaru, stolen half-an-hour ago.

276
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,840
Have you got a face?

277
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,200
I've got something.

278
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,560
He had a key.

279
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,040
Must have lifted it from the owner.

280
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,200
Could be they know each other.

281
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,320
The owner's still in hospital.
He doesn't know his car's missing.

282
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,440
Maybe you should be the one to tell him.

283
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,240
Why... Why would he talk to me?

284
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,520
Because you're DI Lucy Chambers
of the Heart Valley Police,

285
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,000
and you are investigating a crime.

286
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,760
Impersonating a police officer.

287
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,880
I get caught, it's what,

288
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,840
<i>six months in prison?</i>

289
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,520
I have the feeling
you'll be quite convincing.

290
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,640
<i>Go on then, hit me!</i>

291
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,000
<i>Hit me!</i>

292
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,240
Oh...

293
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
Bugger.

294
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
Ow!

295
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,320
Hang on!

296
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,080
Hello?

297
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,040
Yes, speaking.

298
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,720
Erm, no, Victoria passed away
two years ago.

299
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,840
Oh. Thank you.

300
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,920
Erm...

301
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,160
Yes. Yes, I... No, I remember.

302
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,240
Well, I, erm... Not really, no.

303
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,920
It's Victoria who wanted to do it.
I'll be honest, I wasn't keen on the idea.

304
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,080
The police?

305
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,400
What do you mean? What...

306
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,760
Do... Do they know where she is?

307
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,240
Yes, of course
I'll speak to them, anytime.

308
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,200
Tell them I'll speak to them anytime.

309
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,360
What...

310
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,800
What... What else did they say to you?

311
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,320
But they have a lead?

312
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,600
No, I understand.

313
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,920
Well, I'll... I'll wait to hear from them.
Thank you.

314
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,800
Yes, erm...

315
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,640
Thank you.

316
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,680
Yes, goodbye.

317
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,560
- Excuse me?
- Just a sec, love.

318
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,400
- Erm...
- How can I help?

319
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,120
I'm DI Lucy Chambers. I'd like to speak
with one of your patients, a Jack Graham.

320
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,320
Jack Graham. Let's have a look.

321
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,000
You want the Hollingbrook Ward.
Down the hall, first on your right.

322
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,800
Yeah. Okay.

323
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,600
Oh, my God, the food is shit,
like, soup kitchen shit.

324
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,400
Drugs are killer though.
I've got a magic button.

325
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,080
Clickety-click, yes, please.

326
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,680
Mr Graham?

327
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,080
Yeah.

328
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,120
My name's Lucy Ch...
Detective Inspector Lucy Chambers.

329
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,200
I, erm... Could I have a word?

330
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,800
Yeah. Shit, yes.

331
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,640
Erm... Shit, sorry.
I've... I've got to call you back.

332
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,720
Is this about Dougie?
'Cause that has nothing to do with me.

333
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,400
What was nothing to do with you?

334
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,840
He took a shit in someone's bin.

335
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,680
I told him not to, but he still did it.

336
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,920
No, that's...
that's not why I'm here. Erm...

337
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,080
Mr Graham,
could I confirm that you are the owner

338
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:18,960
of a blue Subaru Impreza,
registration KIG 1250?

339
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,960
Yeah.

340
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,080
Why?

341
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,320
The car was, erm, stolen last night.

342
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,640
What?

343
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,080
One of your neighbours caught
the whole thing on a dashboard cam.

344
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,560
What did they do? Break a window?

345
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,080
Er, looks like they...
they had a key. Did you lose a set?

346
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,320
Fuck! Urgh!

347
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,080
Oh, I thought I'd lost them at the pub.

348
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,080
Someone's picked your pocket.

349
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,680
They must have got close to you.

350
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,120
Maybe you recognise him?

351
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,960
Oh, fuck!

352
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,880
Fuck no!

353
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,400
- Do you know him?
- That's Steve Dunn.

354
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,960
Fucking had to be him. Didn't it?

355
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,760
- Fucking had to be him.
- Who's Steve Dunn?

356
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,800
Drinks at The Masons, they reckon
he used to run with a gang.

357
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,600
Got into debt, always nicking stuff.

358
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,000
Mad as fuck.
The landlord's too scared to bar him.

359
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,480
What's his ideology?

360
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,040
- His what?
- His view of the world.

361
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,320
I don't know. We're not friends.

362
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,080
This is definitely him?

363
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,200
Okay.

364
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:43,160
We'll... We'll follow that up
and, er, let you know what we find.

365
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,560
Yeah. Cheers.

366
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,080
Thank you for your time, Mr Graham.

367
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,400
Hey, er...

368
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,680
be careful if you go after him.
He's... proper psycho.

369
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,680
Well, I framed them all.

370
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,280
Victoria didn't want them in the house,
but they're all still here somewhere.

371
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,760
In the chaos.

372
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,920
I'm trying to make this bike roadworthy
again. It's for my granddaughter.

373
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,320
How much of it was true?

374
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
The story on TV?

375
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,920
All of it. Erm, every word.

376
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,040
People said we made it up to,
to get attention, get on TV, but...

377
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,840
I didn't even want to do the show.

378
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,040
No, erm...

379
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,000
I... I don't like to talk about it.

380
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,520
Sorry.

381
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
No, no. It's...

382
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,920
When was the last time you saw Evelyn?

383
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,160
21st of November 1986.

384
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,920
And she just left?

385
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,880
Uh-huh, yeah.

386
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,120
She, er, she said goodbye and...

387
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,960
That morning she had a part-time job.

388
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,680
We thought things were getting better.

389
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,480
And then just before
she left for her shift,

390
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,200
she turned to us and said,
"I'm not supposed to be here."

391
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,160
Victoria asked her what she meant

392
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,200
and she said she had to
get away from the noise,

393
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,960
the echoes and she just had to leave.

394
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,440
You didn't try to stop her?

395
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,160
We thought it was an empty threat.
I mean, she said things like that before,

396
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,480
but she always came home.

397
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,400
Except this time, she didn't.

398
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,000
What else did she say?
Anything about where she was going?

399
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,160
Er, somewhere quiet.

400
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,840
Far away.

401
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,000
Erm, somewhere just for her.

402
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,160
But we did try to find her.
We just didn't know where to start.

403
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,120
Sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

404
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,160
I'm sorry.

405
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,840
No, it's okay.

406
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,080
We're sorry for digging this all up again.

407
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,600
It's never really been buried.

408
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,640
We used to talk about her every day.

409
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,920
She left because we didn't understand her
and we just wanted to understand.

410
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,600
Oh, careful. I...

411
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,560
Sorry, I meant to clean that up.

412
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,040
Did she paint this?

413
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,160
Yeah, yeah.

414
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,160
That's, er... that's part of her...
her black period.

415
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,160
It's not everyone's cup of tea,
but what can you do?

416
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,400
I can't throw them away,
they're part of her.

417
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,360
But this, you see, this is more like it.

418
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,880
She painted this. Porlock Bay.
We used to rent a cottage down there.

419
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,000
It's very beautiful.

420
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,160
Yeah.

421
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,280
Yeah, she loved her painting
more than anything.

422
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,680
She said it helped her
make sense of the world.

423
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,760
What about this?

424
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,320
Yeah. It's, er... That's one of her best.

425
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,320
Victoria hated it.

426
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,440
- Why?
- I think it worried her.

427
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,960
Evelyn said she painted it from memory,
but we'd never been there.

428
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,360
- It's not real.
- Do you mind?

429
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,160
Not at all.

430
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
Hm.

431
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,800
It's very detailed.

432
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,840
"Far Away".

433
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,280
She had a vivid imagination.

434
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,920
Sorry. Do you mind?

435
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,200
No, no. You go ahead if it's helpful.

436
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,960
It might be.

437
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,040
"We found her an old house on the moor."

438
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,480
That's what he said.

439
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,440
"Somewhere she'd never be found."

440
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,840
I think we've just found her.

441
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
See? Not broken.

442
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,680
Not today.

443
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,680
Why did you think this was broken?
Did it look broken?

444
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,200
Oh, that's just recording our voices,
just while Mummy's not in the room.

445
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,520
If there's anything
I want to share with her.

446
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,320
It's nothing to worry about.

447
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,160
Let's talk about things that change.

448
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,200
You said that this ornament was cracked.

449
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,560
What else?

450
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,960
The flowers? Yeah.

451
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,080
Flowers change every week.
I get fresh ones.

452
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,320
Sometimes they're not real.

453
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,200
What else do you see?

454
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,360
Other children.

455
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,880
Do they talk to you?

456
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,440
They're in another loop.

457
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,680
What does that mean?

458
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,600
It's a secret.

459
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,960
We don't have secrets in here, Isaac.

460
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,880
Can you see them now?

461
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,080
Why not?

462
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,080
I'm not cold.

463
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,360
Do you think it's because we're talking?

464
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,960
Do you think if we go really quiet,
you might hear them?

465
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,440
Shall we try that?

466
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,520
Okay, great.

467
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,800
Alright. Erm, close your eyes for me.

468
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,200
Keep them closed.

469
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,520
I'm gonna put some music on.

470
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,800
Now, you can listen to the music.

471
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,520
Or you can listen to the voices

472
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,880
and you can tell me if you hear...

473
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,160
Isaac?

474
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,760
Hi.

475
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,000
Lucy!

476
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,080
- How's he doing?
- Oh, well...

477
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,600
Hi, sweetheart. How'd you get on?

478
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,640
Good! Right, we've got to go.

479
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,640
Mummy made us late, again.
How was it?

480
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,360
Fine. Yeah, I think...
I think we broke new ground.

481
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,880
Oh, good. Do you mind
if we catch up on the phone?

482
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,936
It's just I promised to
have him somewhere by 5:00.

483
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,600
- Of course.
- Come on, darling.

484
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,440
Come on! Oh, what's this?

485
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,120
Sorry, yes. Thanks, that's mine.
Thank you, Isaac.

486
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,080
Thanks, Ruby.

487
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,800
Right. See you next week!

488
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,200
See you, then.

489
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,280
<i>Don't forget your PJs.</i>

490
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,160
<i>I told Debbie we'd be there by 5:30.</i>

491
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,640
<i>Nearly ready?</i>

492
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,840
Have you got everything you need?

493
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,480
Are you okay?

494
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,080
Ruby knows.

495
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,880
What does Ruby know?

496
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,000
- About me.
- What about you?

497
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,040
She knows what's wrong with me.

498
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,760
There's nothing wrong with you.
Do you understand?

499
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,400
You're perfect.

500
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,640
You're a miracle.

501
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,600
I don't want to be a miracle.

502
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,640
You like staying at Meredith's, don't you?

503
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,360
- I like it here.
- I know you do,

504
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,680
but it's just for tonight, I promise.

505
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,680
I just have something I need to do.

506
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,560
And then I'm yours forever.

507
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,640
Yes, I'm leaving now.

508
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,360
Well, do you hear this?

509
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,960
That's my front door.

510
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,960
Oh, stop pissing your pants.
I'll be there.

511
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,840
I said I'll be there!

512
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,600
Ah, fuck!

513
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,560
- Are you inside?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

514
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,040
Dunn's just left.

515
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,520
<i>What was he wearing?</i>

516
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,640
Nothing yellow.

517
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,320
I'll check the rooms.

518
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,600
<i>You're looking for electrical scrap.
Circuit boards, wiring, soldering kits.</i>

519
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,200
<i>Check for chemicals.</i>

520
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,360
Ammonium nitrate fertilisers,
plastic explosives.

521
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,800
<i>Try the backs of cupboards,</i>

522
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,600
loose floorboards, attic space.

523
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,720
<i>Lucy?</i>

524
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,120
<i>Lucy?</i>

525
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,640
Yeah, I know how to search a property.

526
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,960
Got a laptop.

527
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,240
And lots of boxes.

528
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,200
Do they smell?

529
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,720
Everything smells.

530
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,040
Be careful.

It's... full of trainers.

534
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,360
Knockoffs, I think.

535
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,000
There must be hundreds of them.

536
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,480
Shit.

537
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,520
- What?
<i>- Well, this is petty crime.</i>

538
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,560
It doesn't feel right.
What if it's not him?

539
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,640
<i>No.</i>

540
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,560
No, no. It's him.

541
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,040
<i>Can you open his computer?</i>

542
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,880
It's got a password.

543
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,440
<i>What make is it?</i>

544
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,680
Er, I can't...

545
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,640
I... I can't see a brand name.

546
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,840
Alright. Use Keyring One.

547
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,600
Oh... Hold on.

548
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,560
Er... Remind me?

549
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,480
F12.

550
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,280
Which life did you
spend hacking computers?

551
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:11,120
<i>None. I bought this off
a 14-year-old boy in an internet cafe.</i>

552
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,280
Oh.

553
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,640
Guess what his password is?

554
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,880
Is it "password"?

555
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,560
Got it in one! Impressive.

556
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,360
Go on then, Isaac, your turn.

557
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,680
I spy with my little eye,
something beginning with...

558
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,680
...D.

559
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,480
- Something beginning with D?
- D. D. D?

560
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,560
Debbie!

561
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,440
- No.
- No?

562
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,480
So self-centred, Debs.

563
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,600
What about drain?

564
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,400
Isaac?

565
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,840
Is it drain?

566
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,920
No.

567
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,080
Oh, hang on.

568
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,120
Hi.

569
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,120
Yes. Speaking.

570
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,800
That's great news.

571
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,080
I'll get the paperwork sent over tomorrow.

572
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,120
Thank you. Yeah. You too.

573
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,720
Bye.

574
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,640
Isaac?

575
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,920
He disappeared.

576
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,880
<i>None of this makes sense.</i>

577
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,360
<i>Maybe
he cleaned up his search history.</i>

578
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,320
Er, his password was "password", so...

579
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,720
Nothing for bomb.

580
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,280
Explosive.

581
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,440
What about Rigby's Toys?

582
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,120
No, there's nothing on here.

583
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,840
Er...

584
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:59,880
He has been checking
prices for used Subarus.

585
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,040
He sent them to a guy named French.

586
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,000
What?

587
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,920
What is it?

588
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,400
<i>- He's selling the car.</i>
- When?

589
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,720
This Saturday, 11:00 am,
car for cash, Mornes Hill car park.

590
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,040
That's just off the high street.
It's behind Rigby's.

591
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,960
Erm, buyer's from Newcastle.

592
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,240
They've done...

593
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,520
done business before.

594
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,560
It's a coincidence.

595
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,520
You said someone torched the car.

596
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,600
<i>We put out an APW.</i>

597
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,640
They must have known we were
looking for it, wrong place, wrong time.

598
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,080
Gideon, this isn't him.

599
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,960
No, no. It has to be.

600
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,640
<i>It's not!</i>

601
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,120
I've fucked up!

602
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,440
Oh, God.

603
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,600
What is it?

604
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,000
He's back.

605
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,320
- Isaac?
- Isaac?

606
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,560
Isaac!

607
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,600
- Isaac!
- Mum!

608
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,720
Oh, my God.

609
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,680
Meredith, go with Daddy.

610
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,160
Come on, pumpkin.

611
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,240
- Is he okay?
- Don't worry.

612
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,160
What happened, Isaac?

613
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,800
What happened?

614
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,480
It bit me.

615
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,520
What bit you?

616
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,400
The dog.

617
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,400
Where'd it go?

618
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,480
She scared it away.

619
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,560
Who did?

620
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,040
Isaac, who scared it away?

621
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,600
Mum.

622
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,280
Look, listen, alright?

623
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,360
That's not the day we agreed.

624
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,920
End of the week, we said end of the week.

625
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,720
Look, I'll get it back to you
with interest.

626
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,440
Just unfuck your ears for a second
and listen, yeah?

627
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,120
Saturday! That's not tomorrow,
but the next day, Saturday.

628
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,800
I'm shifting a motor, 15k, it's all his.

629
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,920
Will you fucking listen, you deaf prick?

630
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,320
He gets paid when I get paid.

631
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,160
15k and then we're square.

632
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,680
And if he thinks about
sending those kids round here,

633
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,920
they'll be leaving in fucking bin bags!

634
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,040
Work!

635
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,840
Oh, fucking work!

636
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,880
Fucking work!

637
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,560
Shit.

638
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,680
Shit!

639
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,960
Who the fuck are you?

640
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,560
How'd you get in here?

641
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,000
You one of Bianca's mates?

642
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,920
Do you think you can
fucking steal from me?

643
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,680
- No, I'm not! I'm not!
- What's that?

644
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,760
Oh, God!

645
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,800
Please let me go! Please!

646
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,640
You ain't going nowhere.

647
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,040
- What you got on?
- No.

648
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,760
Fuck!

649
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,280
Aargh!

650
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,000
Open the door.

651
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,120
Open the fucking door!

652
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,000
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

653
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,600
Aargh!

654
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,280
You are fucking dead!
