<i>Eleven children.</i>

20
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,840
The real devil's out there...

21
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,600
lurking in the shadows.

22
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,000
The blur on the edge of the picture.

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,880
<i>I don't know his face, but I've seen
what he can do, and so will you.</i>

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,600
<i>Next year, seventeen dead.</i>

25
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,000
Found these in the printer.

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Thanks.

27
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,040
Have you been home?

28
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,760
Oh, didn't see the point. Ravi's
still in Leeds on this training thing.

29
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,760
Have you slept?

30
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,760
Not sure.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well, we've accounted for all the victims.

32
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,240
None of them fit the profile,
the bomber got away.

33
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,720
We're still looking at CCTV.

34
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,000
- Any leads?
- No leads.

35
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,240
Just a reflection. Look here.

36
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,280
It's in the corner of the picture,
yellow hoodie.

37
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,840
But...

38
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
it never comes out clean.

39
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,080
Yeah, you plan something like this,
you know where the cameras are.

40
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,240
Yeah, well, you can't avoid them all.

41
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,640
We'll find him.

42
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,680
No. No, I don't think we will.

43
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,200
Yeah, that's the spirit.
Just sit there feeling sorry for yourself.

44
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,440
Shepherd was a fucking lunatic.

45
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,000
Same as whoever did this.

46
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,600
He knew something bad
was gonna happen,

47
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,600
just like I know
something bad's gonna happen,

48
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,080
'cause something bad
always fucking happens.

49
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,840
The world just keeps revolving from one...

50
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,600
fucked-up horror to the next.

51
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,520
And he got his numbers wrong.

52
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,440
He told me there'd be seventeen dead.

53
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,440
Last I checked there were sixteen.

54
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
What?

55
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Kelly Watson, she was, er...

56
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,320
she was nine months pregnant.

57
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,920
Look, it's...

58
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,880
- No, it's got to be...
- Okay.

59
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,040
- Okay, Nick.
- It's a coincidence.

60
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,520
How many times have you
watched that, by the way?

61
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm just listening to music.

62
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,640
Of course you are.

63
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,120
Silly me.

64
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,120
<i>Existence is a circle, recurring.</i>

65
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,640
<i>And in every recurrence,
you and I sit in this room.</i>

66
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,520
<i>You ask me your questions,
I tell you the truth.</i>

67
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,160
<i>And I warn you what's going to happen
if you don't believe me.</i>

68
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,480
It's been nearly a year,
and he's still dreaming about the fire.

69
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,800
I thought the nightmares would stop,
but they're getting worse.

70
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,680
Just wish there was a way
I could... make him forget.

71
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,040
I'm... I'm cautious with dreams.

72
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,240
They can be noisy and misleading.

73
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,280
There is a common theme, though.

74
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,840
When did Isaac last see his father?

75
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,800
Not since that night.

76
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,640
- Lucy, I think it might be...
- No.

77
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,080
He's never gonna see Mike again.

78
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
- With supervised visits...
- He left him.

79
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,840
He closed the door,
and he left him there to burn.

80
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,880
If I could prove it,
he would be in prison, but I can't.

81
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,320
- And you still don't believe me.
- It's a recurring nightmare.

82
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,320
- Based on a memory.
- A traumatic memory.

83
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,880
Muddled. Blended with imagination.

84
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,120
So what if he wasn't imagining it?

85
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,440
I mean, like, hypothetically.

86
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,000
What if he really experienced
all those impossible things?

87
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,640
How would you treat him?
Like, help him come to terms?

88
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,240
I... I'm not sure I follow.

89
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,280
Never mind.

90
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,080
I just don't want him
to be afraid anymore.

91
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,040
I wish I could... flick a switch.

92
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,880
Lucy, I wanted to ask if we could talk
about some one-to-one sessions.

93
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,120
Not all the time, just...

94
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,960
Mm, sometimes I feel like
he's picking up on your cues.

95
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,520
Lucy.

96
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,600
Yeah.

97
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,680
Sure. I mean,
I-I will think about it.

98
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Thank you.

99
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,720
What do you think?

100
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,160
I can't see it.

101
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,040
Here.

102
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,160
Give it a squeeze.

103
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Better?

104
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,280
Come on.

105
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,080
Got some bits for your room.

106
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,200
Five.

107
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,960
- Fifteen.
- Hmm!

108
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
It's all right.

109
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,960
It's just the house settling.

110
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,880
That's what happens with new houses.
They settle while we settle.

111
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,960
Isaac.

112
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,960
There are no ghosts here, I promise.

113
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,120
What is it?

114
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,520
Meredith said there's
no such thing as ghosts.

115
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,160
But there are.

116
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,720
There was one stood behind her
when she said it.

117
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,880
When was this?
When you went over to play?

118
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,200
Oh, sweetheart.

119
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,400
It's different here.

120
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,320
No one has ever lived in this house.

121
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,120
It's just for us.

122
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,800
Just for this lifetime, yeah?

123
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,400
This loop.

124
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,120
I'm not supposed to be here.

125
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,760
There's no such thing as "supposed to."

126
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,280
We're here because we choose to be.

127
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,120
Just like I chose to have you.

128
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,480
And I'm choosing to win this game!

129
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,360
Oi, mate!

130
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,400
Where you going?

131
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,640
- Walk away.
- What?

132
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,400
What's that, paedo?

133
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,360
- Why are you dressed like a paedo?
- Oi, catch!

134
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,680
Eh!

135
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,360
Give us your money or we'll report you
for being a fucking paedo.

136
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,960
I don't want to hurt you,

137
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,160
so just walk awa... Uhh!

138
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,120
Grab his phone! Quick, grab his phone!

139
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,400
Aargh!

140
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,520
Aargh!

141
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,720
Aaargh!

142
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,440
Aargh!

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,600
Dhillon!

150
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Sorry.

151
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,400
Don't faint on me.

152
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,680
Mnh-mnh.

Jesus Christ!

154
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,920
Just tell me what I need to know.

155
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,120
Victim was struck three times.

156
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,720
Skull fractures here, here and here.

157
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,520
This blow ruptured a blood vessel.

158
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,640
Cause of death, it was an intercranial
hematoma. Not instant.

159
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,640
That's why he was still walking around?

160
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,320
- He bled out.
- No, bled in.

161
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,880
Bleed was between the brain and the skull.

162
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Oh, for fuck's sake.

163
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,680
- Is there anything else?
- Nothing relevant.

164
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,960
Death from head trauma, open and shut.
You can charge your man.

165
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,400
- Right.
- Don't let him escape.

166
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,840
Hilarious. Get some
new material, Gibson.

167
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,080
DI Dhillon.

168
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,720
<i>Ravi, it's Sam.</i>

169
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,480
Sam Boyd.

170
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,680
Boyd?

171
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,640
Hi. Sorry, new phone.

172
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,440
<i>- Haven't got your number saved.</i>
- Yeah.

173
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,320
Sorry to call out of the blue but...

174
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,800
<i>Not a problem. You after a reference?</i>

175
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,840
A favour, a big one.

176
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,600
And you're gonna say no,
but I'm gonna keep on asking.

177
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,360
Of course you are.

178
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,200
Gideon Shepherd was sighted
in Hackridge Park last night.

179
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,680
<i>Hatby wants a DI on the ground.</i>

180
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,920
There are plenty of D.I.s where you are.

181
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,600
No, best one I know moved to Sheffield.

182
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,880
<i>And he's an expert on the case.</i>

183
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,640
The case that nearly got me fired.
Why do you think I moved here?

184
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,080
And we've already
cleared it with your DCI.

185
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,600
I'm not the one you want, Sam.

186
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,880
Why?

187
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,080
I mean, don't you wanna catch him?

188
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,240
Honestly?

189
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,720
I'm not sure I do.

190
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,360
<i>Ravi.</i>

191
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,640
He's out there.

192
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,480
He's close.

193
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,520
For all we know, he's planning something.

194
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,920
Yeah, of course he is.

195
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,800
<i>So help me. Please?</i>

196
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,800
<i>Look, it has to be you.
No one knows him like you do.</i>

197
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,680
That's not entirely true.

198
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,280
<i>Members of the public are
warned not to approach the suspect,</i>

199
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,320
<i>but to notify police
of any possible contact.</i>

200
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,240
<i>This is the first confirmed sighting
of Gideon Shepherd</i>

201
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,480
<i>since he escaped from police custody
eleven months ago,</i>

202
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,240
<i>seriously wounding two police officers
in the process. Wanted...</i>

203
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,280
Shit.

204
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
I told you not to come here.

205
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,560
You weren't answering your phone.

206
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,040
If someone followed you here...

207
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,680
I'm not the one
with my face in the paper.

208
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,320
You hurt people.

209
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,800
They didn't give me a choice.

210
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,480
- Kids.
- Barely.

211
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,440
I was outnumbered. I did what I had to.

212
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,200
Well, they're looking for you.

213
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,480
They've been looking for me
since I was 9 years old.

214
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
A thousand lives ago,
nothing changes.

215
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,640
Everything changes.
You don't know what happens next.

216
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,720
I have an idea.

217
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,080
There's something disgusting
walking around out there.

218
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,240
He could pass me in the street
and I wouldn't even know.

219
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,480
He could do anything to anyone.

220
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,800
But he won't.

221
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,960
We know what he does.

222
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,760
We know when he does it.

223
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,320
The monster just needs a face.

224
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,760
Don't smoke there,
you'll make the curtains smell.

225
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,280
You're gonna hate me
for saying this.

226
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,320
Mm, don't say it, then.

227
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,320
You need to take some time off.

228
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,440
Last year, with Shepherd and Slade,

229
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,080
and now this bombing.

230
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,840
I'm worried it'll break you.

231
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm worried it'll...

232
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
What?

233
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,640
Even when you're here...

234
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,080
you're not here.

235
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
And I miss you.

236
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,640
I know that's selfish. I just...

237
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,400
Ugh! You know what?

238
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,040
- Ignore me.
- No, that's okay.

239
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,160
You're right.

240
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
I am?

241
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,560
You only get one life.

242
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,160
And I miss you too.

243
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,360
We should go away.

244
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,680
Somewhere hot and too expensive.

245
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,560
I don't wanna go away.

246
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,080
I wanna have a baby.

247
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,680
<i>I'm not taking your fucking pills!</i>

248
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,040
<i>She's always here.</i>

249
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,200
She just sits there on the end of the bed.

250
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,880
Don't look at me like that.

251
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,880
Don't look at me like that!

252
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,480
Don't look at me!

253
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,080
Dr Ellis saw her this morning.

254
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,960
Couldn't get her back into bed.

255
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,920
Mum?

256
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,360
She had a good day yesterday.

257
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,000
Not sure what's happened.

258
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,560
Mum, let's, um...

259
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,840
Let's sit you down. Come on, that's it.

260
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
All right.

261
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,920
A nice sit-down.

262
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
There.

263
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,360
Mum?

264
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,320
Look at me.

265
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,520
Er...
Where's Dr Ellis now?

266
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,960
He's with another patient.

267
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,720
Of course he is.

268
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,480
What's changed?
What are you giving her?

269
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,840
Same dosage.

270
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,680
She may have built up a tolerance.

271
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,440
We need to look into options.

272
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,520
Where's the picture?

273
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,640
Dr Ellis wanted to see if she was
staring at the photo or...

274
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,640
just staring.

275
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,600
Can you put it back, please?

276
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,400
Mum.

277
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,000
Talk to me.

278
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,720
Hey? What's happened?

279
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,720
What's wrong, hmm?

280
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,840
- Mum!
- Give her time.

281
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,160
I've given her time.
She just keeps getting worse.

282
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,640
It's this place.

283
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,960
- This is the best place for her.
- Is it?

284
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,120
She needs specialist care.

285
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,440
If-if you want to talk to Dr Ellis...

286
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,536
Dr Ellis doesn't know what's
wrong with her, none of you do.

287
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,680
And you don't listen to me.
Nobody listens!

288
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,640
I'm sorry. I just...

289
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,760
Can you leave us, please?

290
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,120
Where are you?

291
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,760
Where have you gone?

292
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,480
I'm not gonna let you leave me again,
do you understand?

293
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,400
You have to come back.

294
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,160
You have to come back.

295
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
DI Dhillon.

296
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,760
DS Boyd.

297
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,280
Thanks for coming.

298
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,280
It's temporary.

299
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,720
Even so,
if I have to have a babysitter,

300
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,600
it's nice to have someone I can bully.

301
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,600
Should have just asked them
to promote you.

302
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,760
Well, you...
you can take that up with my wife.

303
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,880
And my 3-year-old. Plus, DI's
have to work on Sundays, so...

304
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,280
You still singing in the choir?

305
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,760
Badly but, you know, with feeling.

306
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,960
I've cleared a desk
for you upstairs, so...

307
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,080
I'll grab my pass,
we'll head straight out.

308
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,480
You don't wanna say some hellos?

309
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,960
They don't blame you, Ravi.

310
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,760
For Shepherd?

311
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,040
Or for Nick?

312
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,200
It's not a reunion, Sam.

313
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,640
Yeah. Just saying.

314
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,920
Thank you.

315
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,640
If it's all the same, I just wanna
get out there and put this right.

316
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,360
Yes. It's your call.

317
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,760
So, where do you wanna start?

318
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,720
<i>Now, these cameras
belong to the school,</i>

319
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,960
<i>so you need to be very careful with them.</i>

320
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,520
<i>Jason Williams.</i>

321
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,320
Are you listening?

322
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,080
No!

323
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,400
You're going to be taking
these home with you,

324
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,760
which means that you are responsible
for making sure they stay in one piece.

325
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,360
Martin, that goes for you too.

326
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,040
Er, no, Johnny, don't do that, please.

327
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,080
We're not taking pictures
of ourselves or each other.

328
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,840
Can we pay attention, please?

329
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,600
That goes for you too, Isaac Chambers.

330
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,440
Thank you.

331
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,240
I want you to take pictures of nature.

332
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,640
So... animals, trees, rivers, beaches.

333
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,920
But we're not just thinking about nature.

334
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,056
We're thinking about the effect
that people have on nature.

335
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,240
I thought you all
did brilliant work on these.

336
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,160
- What sort of effect does it...
- Lots of really nice ideas here.

337
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,080
- Or negative...
- Simon, please pay attention.

338
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,376
- I'm not gonna tell you again.
- Are we responsible or irresponsible?

339
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,200
I need to talk to a few of you
about your handwriting,

340
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,120
Okay. Pollution... Jason, put that down!

341
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,240
Isaac, what was I just saying?

342
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,920
What was I just saying?

343
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,800
Is that supposed to be funny?

344
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,840
What's wrong?

345
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,440
Are you feeling okay?

346
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,960
It's all right. It's not broken.

347
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,840
Quiet, please.

348
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,720
We don't wanna scare anyone.
This is all precautionary,

349
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,560
but we can't ignore coincidences.

350
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,160
Shepherd was a stone's throw away.

351
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,920
It's possible he's planning something.

352
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,360
Some of the kids come
to school through that park.

353
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,120
We need to make parents aware of
the risks but without causing a panic.

354
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,520
No, sure.

355
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,640
Sorry, Miss.

356
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,960
Sorry.

357
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,360
Sorry, I... I've forgotten your name.

358
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,640
DI Dhillon. Ravi.

359
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,040
All good?

360
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,160
Sorry. DS Boyd.

361
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,520
Er, Miss Rogers.

362
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,040
Elena. Isaac's teacher.

363
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,240
Great. Well...

364
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,920
if you see anything suspicious,
just give us a call.

365
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,920
Straight to mobile,
don't bother with the office.

366
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,440
Oh... er, thank you.

367
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,920
<i>"This is for you," said the kind dog.</i>

368
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,440
<i>"Thank you," said Thomas,
"now I don't have to be sad anymore.</i>

369
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,440
As long as I have this,
I will think of you,

370
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,640
<i>and I will never be lonely again."</i>

371
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,920
<i>"Never be lonely again."</i>

372
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,200
What are you doing here, Lucy?

373
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,360
Stocking up.

374
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,680
What are these?

375
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,880
Oh, pain au chocolat.

376
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,120
Don't tell me you've
never had pain au chocolat?

377
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
No.

378
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,120
Well, they're nice.
You have them for breakfast.

379
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,440
- Who has chocolate for breakfast?
- You only live once.

380
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,680
- No, you don't.
- Doesn't matter, they're not for you.

381
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,160
Who are they for?

382
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,440
Lucy?

383
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,160
Mum's in the car.

384
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,120
No. No, no, no, no. You can't do this.

385
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,920
She knows this house.

386
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,600
We made memories here,
it's the only place she'll find them.

387
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,160
You are not thinking clearly.

388
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,560
No. No, I'm not because if I don't do
something now, I will lose her forever.

389
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,520
There is no forever.

390
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,520
She will come back.

391
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,120
So will you, so will I,
and so will everyone else.

392
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,760
And round and round
it goes like a fucking pinwheel.

393
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:05,320
I tried to save her, I tried to
give her a life, but her body rejected it.

394
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,520
There's nothing you can do.

395
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,360
- You don't know that.
- I know everything.

396
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,800
My mind is thousands of years old.

397
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,160
You've got two lives in your head,
I've got hundreds.

398
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,200
I've burnt, I've drowned,
I've bled to death.

399
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,040
I've lived, I've loved.

400
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,640
- I can't help you.
- I'm not asking for your help.

401
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,400
I will come in every day.
I'll feed her, I'll bath her.

402
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,440
- No!
- You won't know she's here.

403
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,200
No, I told you.

404
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,120
You need to stay away from me.
You think you're safe?

405
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,280
You're not.

406
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,120
You think you know me? You don't.

407
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,640
I kill people.

408
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,440
You kill people who hurt others.

409
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,360
I kill people who get in my way.

410
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,000
She won't get in your way.

411
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,600
Excuse me.

412
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,080
Hello.

413
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,960
DI Dhillon.
I think we met last year.

414
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,840
Did we?

415
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,640
The Gideon Shepherd case.

416
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,640
Oh, right.

417
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,400
This is DS Boyd.

418
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,640
We'd like a word with the boss,
if that's alright?

419
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,320
Yeah, sure, wait there.
I'll see if he's free.

420
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,960
<i>No, she's not worked here
for months.</i>

421
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,320
- Are you still in touch?
- Off and on.

422
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,960
She handed her notice after...

423
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,440
- well, everything.
- Where's she working now?

424
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,640
Nowhere.

425
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,360
As far as we know.

426
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,440
What does she do for money?

427
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,000
Well, she had an insurance payout
when her house burnt down,

428
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,936
and she divorced her husband,
he had a bit of cash.

429
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,880
And she's been gambling.

430
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,800
I've seen her at the bookies
a couple of times.

431
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
Horse racing?

432
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,080
Wimbledon final. She won a stack of cash.

433
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,840
You don't get great odds on tennis,
so she must've staked quite a bit.

434
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,000
I guess everyone's luck turns eventually.

435
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,816
<i>It's been very difficult
to predict this season, hasn't it?</i>

436
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,320
<i>Most games have been hard to call
so there's every chance</i>

437
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,560
<i>- Kevin will surprise you.
- You're right.</i>

438
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,040
<i>They've made a comeback after
a challenging start to the competition.</i>

439
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,160
<i>Last five weeks
seen a fair few near misses.</i>

440
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,800
<i>The last two games have surprised me.
They've taken on some tough opponents.</i>

441
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,000
<i>Their new coach has
really proved himself.</i>

442
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,560
Ravi.

443
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,640
Hi.

444
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,200
- What are you...?
- I, um...

445
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,600
I'm back in town.
Thought we should catch up.

446
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,400
And I don't have your number, so...

447
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,280
How did you find us?

448
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,640
Well, I'm a detective.

449
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,000
- If it's a bad time, I could just...
- No, it's, er...

450
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,320
It's good to see you.

451
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,960
Hello, Isaac. Long time no see.

452
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,760
Hey. You remembered.

453
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,920
Um, Isaac, do you wanna
change out of your uniform, yeah?

454
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,280
Good boy.

455
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,120
It's a weird place to live, Chambers.

456
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,440
Yeah, well...

457
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,040
I haven't paid my TV license,
so hoping they don't find us out here.

458
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,160
Well, your secret's safe with me.

459
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,200
Do you wanna come in?

460
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,160
Do you want a beer? Or are you on duty?

461
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,920
Sort of.

462
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,680
Sort of?

463
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,520
You're back for him, aren't you?
I saw the news.

464
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,520
I thought it was over.

465
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,640
I thought...

466
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,600
all that stuff he said about
razor blades and resetting...

467
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,080
- maybe he just...
- Slashed his wrists?

468
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,560
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

469
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,080
How long are you back for?

470
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,120
As long as it takes.

471
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,640
I spoke to Isaac's teachers.

472
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,440
They're, er...
they're taking it seriously.

473
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,760
He's left us alone for a year.

474
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,560
He's a deranged monster,
and he's obsessed with you.

475
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,080
He was spotted in the park
behind Isaac's school.

476
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,280
Aren't you worried?

477
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,640
Mmm, should I be?

478
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,360
He's never hurt me,
he's never threatened me.

479
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,000
Yeah, well, he beat me
half to death, so...

480
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,120
I, um...

481
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,160
I keep a taser in the car now.

482
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,520
Is that allowed?

483
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Not really.

484
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,760
I tried to visit you in hospital.

485
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,280
Tried?

486
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,320
The boss said it was a bad idea.

487
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,160
I was fighting to keep my job.

488
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,400
Oh.

489
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,000
I did call after,
but you changed your number.

490
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,400
Downgraded. Digital detox.

491
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,560
Smart.

492
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,000
Nope, that's the point.

493
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,400
You should stay for dinner.
Made a... a cassoulet.

494
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,200
Or casserole. What's the different?

495
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,080
What is the difference between
a cassoulet and a casserole?

496
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,920
I just... It's... It's a stew thing.

497
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,800
I don't want to intrude.

498
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,320
No, I've made loads.

499
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,320
Plus, you know,
if you're worried about us,

500
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,680
you probably should stick around a bit,
you know, keep us safe.

501
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,000
I don't think you need me
to keep you safe.

502
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,880
I do need you.

503
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,200
Besides, it's like you said,
there's a monster on the loose.

504
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,000
You don't have to eat it all.
I probably gave you too much.

505
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,840
Not possible. This is delicious.

506
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,256
Well, you're lucky
you're getting real food.

507
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,240
We usually rely on Captain Birdseye,

508
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,800
or Colonel Sanders,
if I'm feeling really stretched.

509
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,640
Clearly have a thing
about men with beards.

510
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,160
Isaac prefers fish fingers, don't you?

511
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,240
Not a big fan of Brussels sprouts, I see.

512
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,480
Top tip:

513
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,920
They're much nicer if you roast them.

514
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,600
If you boil them, they go a bit stodgy.

515
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,400
Um, well, you don't have
to eat my stodgy sprouts.

516
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,760
Oh, I didn't. I just put them in
my pocket when you weren't looking.

517
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,920
Unbelievable!

518
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,960
Just for that,
you can do all the washing up.

519
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,960
- I was gonna offer anyway.
- Were you?

520
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,000
- Yeah. Because I'm very polite.
- Yeah.

521
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,840
Right.

522
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,040
Oh. Thank you.

523
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,600
Ready to do this?

524
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,320
Okay, you warm enough?

525
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,160
Shall we have a few pages of Narnia?

526
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,680
I'm tired.

527
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:08,040
Well, look, I will put Metal Mickey here.

528
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,480
He'll scare away
your nightmares.

529
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,560
Okay.

530
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,440
Sleep well, darling.

531
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,560
You're happy.

532
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,960
Am I?

533
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,840
Why do you say that?

534
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,200
He makes you smile.

535
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,880
And you make him smile.

536
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,560
So you should kiss him.

537
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,600
You can't just go round
kissing whoever you like.

538
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,200
Look, I'll kiss you instead.
Come here. Mwah!

539
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,240
Ah! Night-night.

540
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,320
Night.

541
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,440
What are you doing?

542
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,160
Sorry, I wasn't, er...

543
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,120
- Yeah, that's private.
- I know, I shouldn't have opened it.

544
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,000
But I did.

545
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,720
- Lucy.
- What?

546
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,880
It's just a dream diary.
My therap... thera...

547
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,360
Isaac's therapist told me to keep one.

548
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,680
A dream diary?

549
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,440
Mm-hmm.

550
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,160
Okay.

551
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,600
Okay.

552
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,600
Lucy, if there's any...

553
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,880
Sorry.

554
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,280
- Hey.
- Morning.

555
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,680
It's 8:30, yeah.

556
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,040
Sorry. I overslept.

557
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,200
Where?

558
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,960
Er...

559
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,200
You went...
You went to see Lucy Chambers?

560
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,600
It got late, I slept on the sofa.

561
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,600
I'll be five minutes.
I'm just gonna freshen up.

562
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,960
Ravi.

563
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,440
I've seen the tapes.

564
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,840
Gideon Shepherd.

565
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,600
He got to her.

566
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,880
- I know you don't see it.
- I see it.

567
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,000
I need you to look up a name.

568
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,040
Evelyn Wiseman.

569
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,960
See if there's a connection.

570
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,120
Evelyn Wiseman.

571
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,160
Did you get that from her?

572
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,360
I'll be five minutes.
