00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,160
Oh!

39
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,480
<i>...to avoid Hackridge High Street while
we ascertain the cause of the explosion</i>

40
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,840
<i>and secure the area.</i>

41
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,400
Lucy.

42
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,600
<i>Dunn came back.</i>

43
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,200
What happened?

44
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,680
It's not him, it's a dead end.

45
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,360
- Gideon...
<i>- It's alright.</i>

46
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,840
Nothing's changed.

47
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,600
We still know when it's gonna happen.

48
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,560
I just need to get close.

49
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,600
Do you know how to defuse a bomb?

50
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,600
<i>I have to see his face.</i>

51
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,480
Once I know who he is, I can stop him.

52
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,480
Next time? You're talking about
next time, another life.

53
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,040
<i>That's how it works.</i>

54
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,560
If I can't change it, I'll learn, I reset.

55
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,240
I'm not resetting.
I'm... I'm phoning the shop, okay?

56
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,160
I... I... I will call in a bomb threat.

57
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,040
Then we lose.

58
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,560
<i>Everything I've worked for.</i>

59
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,040
<i>He'll pick a new target.</i>

60
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,720
<i>I won't know where or when or how.</i>

61
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,920
<i>You make that call,</i>

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
you're putting everyone at risk.

63
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,240
No one can know but us, do you understand?

64
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,080
<i>Anything changes,
we lose him in the chaos.</i>

65
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,800
Just go home, Lucy.

66
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,040
<i>I don't think I can.</i>

67
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,880
Dunn's dead. He came at me, I shot him.

68
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,040
<i>Gideon?</i>

69
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,040
Did you clean up?

70
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,720
I... I didn't have time.

71
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,240
- I had to get out of there.
<i>- Did anyone see you go?</i>

72
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,840
I don't know.

73
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,960
Come back here.

74
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,000
Clean up, burn your clothes.

75
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,440
If you lie low,
we might still have a chance.

76
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,920
What about Isaac?

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,920
<i>You said he was with a friend.</i>

78
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,600
<i>Is he safe?</i>

79
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
<i>Lucy?</i>

80
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,840
<i>Lucy?</i>

81
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
Yeah.

82
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,640
Are you with me?

83
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,200
Do I have a choice?

84
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,800
I'll see you soon.

85
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Oh.

86
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,680
- Debbie?
<i>- Lucy.</i>

87
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,416
<i>- Sorry, I've been trying to call you.</i>
- Wait. What... what's happened?

88
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
<i>It's Isaac. We've just got
back from the hospital.</i>

89
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,000
<i>He was attacked, bitten by a dog.</i>

90
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,360
Er... He...

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,480
- He what?
<i>- Are you far away?</i>

92
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,880
No, no, no, I'm coming.
I'm coming right now. I'm coming.

93
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,760
<i>Sorry. I don't know what ha...</i>

94
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,840
He was right there
and then he wasn't.

95
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,680
Alright.

96
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,000
I took my eyes off him for a second.

97
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,080
A second.

98
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,080
This was tied to the wound
when we found him.

99
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,240
Erm, I'm gonna need to take him home.
Are you alright to walk, darling?

100
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,200
- Lucy...
- It's not your fault.

101
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,040
- Okay, it's just... It's not.
- No one saw a dog.

102
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,840
And whoever found him just left him there.

103
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,880
- Why would they leave him?
- I don't know!

104
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,320
- Debs...
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

105
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,920
Please stop saying sorry.
Okay? You've done nothing wrong.

106
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,880
Meredith was right next to him.

107
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,200
She says he vanished.

108
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,280
She says she saw him disappear.

109
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,160
It's just her mind playing tricks.

110
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,640
You know, it happens.

111
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,280
You weren't there.

112
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,040
No.

113
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,640
No, I wasn't.

You didn't have to come out.

126
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,440
What are we looking at?

127
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,840
Or trying not to look at?

128
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,880
Shotgun blast.

129
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,320
Likely a sawn-off.

130
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,280
No sign of a break-in.

131
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,320
What, gang crime?

132
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,160
Possibly. Take a look.

133
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
Yeah, I... I will if...

134
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,520
if you have a look at these.

135
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,320
From Shrewsbury Museum, archive photos.

136
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,720
Look at number four.

137
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,880
Do you recognise it?

138
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,120
That's the house in Evelyn's painting.

139
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,000
How did you find this?

140
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,840
Look at the caption.

141
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,120
"Far Away Farm."

142
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,520
This could lead us to Shepherd.

143
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,440
And... if Lucy Chambers knew about it,
that's obstruction.

144
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,520
Okay, we still don't know
what we've found here.

145
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,880
We've found Evelyn Wiseman!

146
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,760
Maybe we've found Jonah Taylor.

147
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,440
That house is 40 miles west of Birmingham,
we could go there tomorrow.

148
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,960
We've got a fresh body, still warm.

149
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,360
It's not a good time to go chasing ghosts.

150
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,200
I'll go. You stay on the homicide.

151
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,760
If this is a dead end,
I'll take the flak.

152
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,240
- And Lucy Chambers?
- I'll call her in the morning.

153
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,640
Ask her to answer some questions.

154
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,960
On the record.

155
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,040
Okay.

156
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,000
Good. Thanks.

157
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,520
And I know what you're up to.

158
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,040
Going out there.

159
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,400
Taking the flak.

160
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,960
You just wanna get away from the blood.

161
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,720
I like your watch.

162
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,920
It's broken.

163
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,320
If it's broken, why not, erm...

164
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,360
throw it out?

165
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,480
It keeps the ghosts away.

166
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,520
Then it's not broken, it's doing
exactly what it's meant to do.

167
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,920
Have you ever seen
a dog barking at nothing?

168
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,200
See, they sense things.

169
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,160
Things most people can't see.

170
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,280
The changes.

171
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,600
The ripples.

172
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,680
The things that aren't
supposed to be here.

173
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,880
I killed a dog.

174
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,000
A year ago.

175
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,560
Because it was broken.

176
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,640
It was dangerous.

177
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,760
I think that the dog that bit you...

178
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,680
was the dog that lived.

179
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,240
It saw you...

180
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,760
through the veil.

181
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,640
Caught the scent of a threat.

182
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,120
Of another life.

183
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,320
Of a world in which it no longer existed.

184
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,880
Keep the watch, Isaac.

185
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,440
You're going to need it.

186
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,320
Time for bed, Isaac.

187
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,280
Go upstairs, brush your teeth,
I'll be up in a minute.

188
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,960
Is there anything to drink?

189
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,440
Is that a good idea?

190
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,400
Cupboard by the stove.

191
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,880
You shouldn't have brought him here.

192
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,800
He's not safe with anyone else.

193
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,400
He's not safe here.

194
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,160
I don't know what happens next.
We may need to run.

195
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,680
Then we take him with us.

196
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,360
It's no life for a child.

197
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,520
He's not your responsibility.

198
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,720
I'm the reason he exists.

199
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,160
Isaac.

200
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,760
Look what you're doing.
You're getting it all on the carpet.

201
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,600
Come on, off to bed.

202
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
Mum?

203
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,600
Night-night, darling.

204
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,280
Night-night.

205
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,480
<i>- I have a plan.
- Go on.</i>

206
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,080
<i>Oh, it's stupid.</i>

207
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,880
Tell me your stupid plan.

208
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,920
Whenever we come here,

209
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,600
we talk about the past and you...

210
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,960
you think about the things you've lost.

211
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,520
I think we should talk about the future.

212
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,040
And all the things... What?

213
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,520
You've got your serious face on!

214
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,440
Well, that's because I'm very serious.

215
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,320
Mm. Mm-hm. Yeah. Of course.

216
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,600
I have a very serious question to ask you.

217
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,720
Okay!

218
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,560
Oh, my God!

219
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,880
- Lucy Chambers...
- Er...

220
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,720
- You're shaking your head.
- No, I'm not, I'm not.

221
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,720
Open it.

222
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,560
- Lucy Chambers...
- Yes.

223
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,040
- Will you...
- Yes.

224
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,920
- You will?
- Yes, I will.

225
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,760
- Ask me properly!
- You keep interrupting me.

226
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,240
Mm.

227
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,760
Will you marry me?

228
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,600
Yeah, I guess.

229
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,840
Well, get up, you idiot!

230
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,120
Shit!

231
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,080
Those things will kill you.

232
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,280
Have you figured it out yet?

233
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,200
I can't show my face in that shop
until the last minute.

234
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,960
It doesn't give me much time.

235
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,560
I could go in.

236
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,560
I'd blend in, I could keep an eye out.

237
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,560
- It's Dhillon, again.
- Answer it.

238
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,440
Everything's fine.

239
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,240
You can't see him today, you're too busy.

240
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,240
I told you to stop calling this number.

241
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,920
<i>Sorry, couldn't help myself.</i>

242
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,280
You good?

243
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,880
<i>Yeah, fine.</i>

244
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,200
<i>You?</i>

245
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,400
Yeah.

246
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,440
You at home?

247
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,440
No. Er, I'm at the hospital

248
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,080
with Isaac.

249
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,240
He got bitten by a dog, believe it or not.

250
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,880
Believe it or not.

251
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,640
Sorry?

252
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,760
I want you to come into the station.

253
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,760
We'd like you to answer some questions.

254
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,440
What... Who's "we"?

255
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,640
What questions?

256
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,560
<i>Ask for DS Boyd.</i>

257
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,800
Where will you be?

258
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,080
- I'm taking a trip.
<i>- Where?</i>

259
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,080
Ravi, if you want to ask me
some questions, just ask me.

260
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,280
Okay.

261
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,040
Where did you hear
the name Evelyn Wiseman?

262
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
What? Who's Evelyn Wiseman?

263
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,800
- Just come into the station, Lucy.
<i>- Er...</i>

264
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,280
I have to go. My phone's
about to run out of battery.

265
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,520
No, it isn't.

266
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,800
I'm really sorry. I will talk to you
later though. Love you.

267
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,640
I love you.

268
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
Love you.

269
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,920
I love you. I love you. I love you.

270
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,760
<i>Ravi?</i>

271
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,320
Call him back.

272
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
What?

273
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,680
We need to know exactly what they know.

274
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,160
If they have Evelyn's name,

275
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,080
they can find out where she is.

276
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,680
He said he's taking a trip.

277
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,040
- Gideon?
- What did you tell him?

278
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,400
Nothing.
He must've seen the name in my notebook.

279
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,320
It's fine. You said they never find her.

280
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,640
They never found her before
but we've changed it.

281
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,080
Anything can happen now.
I have to get to her.

282
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,000
She's not the priority. If they
catch you, this is all for nothing!

283
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,960
She knows about Rigby's.

284
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,560
She remembers, Lucy.

285
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,440
Well, what does it matter?
She won't tell the police.

286
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,520
She will. She's unstable.

287
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,560
If she tells the police,
they close the shop.

288
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,400
They investigate, the bomb never goes off.

289
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,000
I never see his face and we're back
to where we started, or worse.

290
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,480
- What's worse?
- They take us alive, after all this.

291
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,040
And it's not prison,
it's drugs, it's therapy.

292
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,280
If they numb our minds,
they make us forget.

293
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,800
No more echoes.

294
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,080
No more memories.

295
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
Hard reset.

296
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,640
Doesn't sound so bad
when you put it like that.

297
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,080
Ignorance won't make it bearable,
not when it happens again and again.

298
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,720
You won't be able to stop him.

299
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,440
And I'll be dead
years before you were even born.

300
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,680
Keep Dhillon out of my way.

301
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,320
If you hurt him...

302
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,560
I will fucking kill you.

303
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,640
You won't be the first.

304
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,200
If anybody comes here,
anyone at all, you hide.

305
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,160
And you call me. Do you understand?

306
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,200
There's only one number on this phone.
Remember how I showed you?

307
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,040
Hold on to your watch.

308
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,560
Don't lose your balance.

309
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,640
Okay.

310
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,440
Good boy.

311
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,000
I love you.

312
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,280
But you have to leave me?

313
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,960
I'm not leaving you.

314
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,160
Here, look at me.

315
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,960
I'm never going to leave you.

316
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,920
Never.

317
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,600
Keep the door locked.

318
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,320
Lucy.

319
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,360
We need to talk.

320
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,080
- I have somewhere to be.
- So you found her, Evelyn.

321
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
- What do you know about Evelyn?
- Let's go inside.

322
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,240
Let's not.

323
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,081
- It's a dead end. She's not there anymore.
- How would you know that?

324
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,800
Because I've been there.
I'm looking for answers, same as you.

325
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,000
- Then why didn't you tell me?
- I don't know. I...

326
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,600
I am just trying to move past it, him!

327
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,560
Everything that happened.

328
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,320
Ravi, there...

329
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,040
There is nothing out there.

330
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,680
I think I'll see for myself, thanks.

331
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,600
I'm pregnant.

332
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,840
How sure are you?

333
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,800
Three tests, three positives.

334
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,800
Well, what do you want to do?

335
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,040
Would it scare you if I said
I wanted to be a family?

336
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,440
We hardly know each other.

337
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,920
Do you really believe that?

338
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,400
I've never read this.

339
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,360
Don't know why.

340
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,120
It was always your favourite.

341
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,800
You've just lost my place.

342
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,000
That's what it feels like sometimes.

343
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,000
Coming back to a book without a mark.

344
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,960
You can't remember where you got to
and you slowly realise

345
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,400
you've read these chapters already.

346
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
Have you ever told me about this?

347
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,760
The bookmark?

348
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,680
No, I haven't.

349
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,160
It was your eighth birthday.

350
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,480
You went for a walk in Housden Forest.

351
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,400
You, your mum, your dad.

352
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,760
Rhea ran on ahead
and she found this note on the ground.

353
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,240
Finders keepers.

354
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,280
You threw a strop because
you wanted it for yourself.

355
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,800
It was your birthday,
why should she get a present?

356
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,440
But your parents said it was hers
so she should keep it.

357
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,480
- How...
- You sulked for the rest of the day.

358
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,560
And that night you went into her room

359
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,640
and you stole the note
from her piggy bank.

360
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,720
And when she realised it was gone,
she was so upset

361
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,600
she cried herself to sleep.

362
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,080
Everyone knew you'd taken it.

363
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,440
But you denied it
and denied it and denied it.

364
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,440
And you denied it
because you hated yourself.

365
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,320
You knew you couldn't spend it
so you kept it.

366
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,760
Preserved it, laminated it.

367
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,320
It's the worst thing you ever did.

368
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,120
It's your sense of justice.
It's the reason you do what you do.

369
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,640
I've never told anyone that story.

370
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,240
I know you.

371
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,880
I've known you a million times.

372
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,160
I've loved you a million times.

373
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,560
I am the only person you've ever told.

374
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,600
I'm the only person you'll ever tell.

375
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,040
What do you wanna do?

376
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,640
I wanna go to that house.

377
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,800
- I told you, it...
- It's a dead end.

378
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,920
Fine.

379
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,560
If we find it empty, that means
you're telling me the truth.

380
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,560
But if we find Evelyn Wiseman,

381
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,040
I'm taking her in for questioning.

382
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,680
And I'm arresting you for obstruction.

383
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,440
<i>I... I'm looking for a Jack Graham.</i>

384
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,520
Drives a blue Subaru Impreza.
I'm told he works here.

385
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,880
Not today. He's in hospital.

386
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,760
Jumped off a wall round back.

387
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,320
Broke both his ankles.

388
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,640
Silly twat.

389
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
Was Steven Dunn involved?

390
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
No.

391
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,280
He just drinks here.

392
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,680
Drank.

393
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Right.

394
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,600
Do you know who killed him?

395
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,000
No. I'm... That's what
we're trying to find out, so...

396
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,360
Sorry, erm...

397
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Just...

398
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,680
DS Boyd.

399
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,160
<i>Oh, hello.
It's Elena Rogers from Lyle Hill.</i>

400
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,680
Miss Rogers, hi.

401
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,760
Erm... What can I do for you?

402
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,120
<i>You said to call...</i>

403
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,680
if there was anything suspicious.

404
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,800
<i>Isaac Chambers is off today.</i>

405
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,720
<i>Apparently, he's been bitten.</i>

406
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Bitten?

407
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,040
<i>- By a dog.</i>
- What?

408
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,800
<i>I know.</i>

409
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,840
<i>Mum's worried it might be infected
so she's taken him back to hospital.</i>

410
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,160
Okay.

411
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,000
<i>It's not the first time
that Isaac's been injured.</i>

412
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,840
Well, last year, he burnt his hand.

413
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,640
<i>They were cagey on the details.</i>

414
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,320
And mentally, he's...

415
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,720
I'm worried about him.

416
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,200
<i>I should have spoken
to Children's Services,</i>

417
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,640
<i>but she used to run that department.</i>

418
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,120
<i>They're all friends with her.</i>

419
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,280
<i>It wouldn't be handled well.</i>

420
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,400
No.

421
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,200
I don't suppose it would.

422
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,640
There's something wrong with that family.

423
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,920
<i>I don't know what they're hiding but
someone needs to start asking questions.</i>

424
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,080
<i>I was hoping that someone might be you.</i>

425
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,280
Yeah.

426
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,800
I think it might be.

427
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,840
Well, look, thanks, Miss Rogers, erm...

428
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,920
I'll be in touch.

429
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,520
Hello, Grandma.

430
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,600
This is real.

431
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Evelyn?

432
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,960
Hello, Evelyn.

433
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,520
You're not supposed to be here.

434
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,240
Pack everything that matters.

435
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,800
Anchors, keepsakes.

436
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,480
I don't think we'll be coming back.

437
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,400
Evelyn, do you hear me?

438
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Evelyn?

439
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,720
There's a ghost in the mirror.

440
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,240
We need to get you out of here.

441
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,520
The police are coming.

442
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,960
They know where you are.

443
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,200
We have to tell Jonah.

444
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,800
Jonah is not the problem
right now, Evelyn.

445
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,880
Evelyn, Evelyn, stay with me. Evelyn.

446
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,680
I... I can't leave.

447
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,640
I have to fix
the washing machine tomorrow.

448
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,160
It's going to break.

449
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,120
You know what happens tomorrow.

450
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,400
It's going to happen again
unless I can stop it.

451
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,240
No, no, no. It's all wrong.

452
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,600
It doesn't happen like this.

453
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,800
You don't come here!

454
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,080
Evelyn, wait!

455
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,880
Evelyn, don't do this!

456
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,960
Please. I can't leave you here.

457
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,000
You understand me? I don't have a choice.

458
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,120
They're coming.

459
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,400
They're coming.

460
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,320
Thanks.

461
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,520
Is this your taser?

462
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,120
Put that back.

463
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,520
You ever used it?

464
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,000
I mean it.

465
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,880
Just put it...

466
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
back!

467
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,200
What the fuck are we doing?

468
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,320
You realise this is insane? We're driving
200 miles to look at an empty house.

469
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,480
So you keep saying.

470
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,960
Just turn around. I'll come
to the station, I'll go on record.

471
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,000
People lie on record.

472
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,480
You know me, Ravi.

473
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,960
Do I?

474
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,160
You've always known me.

475
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,560
We'll see.

476
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,120
I know this room.

477
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,800
This is my room.

478
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,880
Is it a dream?

479
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,640
It's all a blur.

480
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,480
Where's Lucy?

481
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,040
She's coming back.

482
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,160
She promised.

483
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,640
Isaac.

484
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,560
Your name is Isaac.

485
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,480
And you didn't cry when you were born.

486
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,120
But we...

487
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,440
we watched the birds together.

488
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,120
Oh, I've been...

489
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,920
I've been asleep for such a long time.

490
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,280
Thank you for waking me up.

491
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,480
<i>I know this is hard.</i>

492
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,920
<i>I know...</i>

493
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,400
But the police are coming.

494
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,080
If you don't leave with me now,

495
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,320
they're going to take you
and they won't understand.

496
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,320
They will make you tell them things,

497
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,320
things...

498
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,120
that will put a lot of people
in danger, a lot of people!

499
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,840
I can't leave you here.

500
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,920
Evelyn.

501
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,640
I can't trust you.

502
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,080
I'm sorry.

503
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,800
I'm sorry.

504
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,160
Do we have to start again?

505
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,560
No.

506
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,680
But you can't stay here.

507
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,680
Where are we going?

508
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,880
Somewhere safe.

509
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,880
- You have to pull over.
- No.

510
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,200
They can go back.

511
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,880
Ravi, no. No, no, no, no, no.

512
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,520
Get out of the car!

513
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,760
Drop the gun.

514
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,120
Now!

515
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,040
Stay back!

516
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,480
Last warning.

517
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,760
You shoot me with that thing,

518
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,280
every muscle in my body contracts,

519
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,360
including my trigger finger.

520
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,640
Put it down.

521
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,920
Get back in the car.
You do not understand what you're doing.

522
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,120
But she does.

523
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,600
Yes.

524
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,920
Gideon, drop the gun.

525
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,200
I can't do that.

526
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,080
We can explain.

527
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,160
He'll never believe you.

528
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,560
What won't I believe?

529
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,040
What the fuck is going on?

530
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,080
Ravi, you have to listen to him.

531
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,840
I would rather not hurt you.

532
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,160
The feeling isn't mutual.

533
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,040
Don't take another step.

534
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,120
No, no, no. Lucy?

535
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,440
- Is she okay?
- Lucy, can you hear me?

536
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,440
- Is she okay?!
- I don't know!

537
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,480
Lucy? Lucy?

538
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,200
Ravi.

539
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,680
Lucy? Lucy?

540
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,960
Are you alright?

541
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,040
Yeah.

542
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,000
They knew we were coming for her.

543
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,880
You told him.

544
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,640
There's... There's no signal here.

545
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,400
Aah! Argh!

546
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,760
Let me help you.

547
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,960
You've done enough.

548
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,880
Oh, come on,
you've never been good at this.

549
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,960
Just stop talking!

550
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,360
You're under arrest.

551
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,920
I need you to get off your feet.
You look like you're gonna faint.

552
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,520
Ravi, I can... I can explain.
I can explain everything.

553
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,760
You're going to.

554
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,840
- Can I help?
- DS Boyd.

555
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,800
Hart Valley Police.
I'm looking for a patient, Jack Graham.

556
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,400
- Er, Jack Graham.
- Oh, found his car, did you?

557
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,160
We did.

558
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,560
- He knows it was missing?
- Someone was in yesterday.

559
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,840
Showed him pictures. One of your lot.

560
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,560
- A police officer?
- Erm...

561
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,040
Detective, I think.

562
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,080
Did you get a name?

563
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,320
Don't remember.

564
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,640
I need to check your CCTV.

565
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,480
Hollingbrook Ward?

566
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,440
What sort of time are we talking?

567
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,000
10:00 am, thereabouts.

568
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,720
Uh-huh.

569
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,520
Oh, hello.

570
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,560
- Stop, stop, stop, stop. Go back.
- No, no.

571
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,680
You think that's who you're looking for?

572
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,040
I know it is.

573
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,840
You're not taking me home, are you?

574
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,680
If you were, we'd have
taken a right back there.

575
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,720
I meant what I said.

576
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,560
You can't pretend you don't believe me.

577
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,120
I know part of you does.

578
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,400
I know.

579
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,960
I believe that you believe it.

580
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,720
So I'm crazy. I'm losing my mind.

581
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,480
We can go crazy together.

582
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
What?

583
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,760
Seventeen dead.

584
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,120
Eleven children.

585
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,960
But you can't tell me where or when.

586
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,560
- It's too dangerous.
- What does that mean?

587
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,160
We can stop it.

588
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,720
But we need him
to go through with the plan.

589
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,600
We need to see his face,
it's the only way.

590
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,320
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

591
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,440
I do love you.

592
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,760
I don't know why.

593
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,040
But I do.

594
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,000
And I'm worried about you, Lucy.

595
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,080
I think you're gonna get hurt or...

596
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,400
or worse.

597
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,360
That's why I have to
take you to the station.

598
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,200
- No, you can't, Ravi!
- It's for the best.

599
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,160
Please. Look, just... Urgh!

600
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,120
Just look at me, look at me.

601
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,200
You know me. I know that you...

602
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,680
Ah!

603
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,360
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Just give me a s...

604
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,640
<i>Unfortunately, lots of women
do miscarry in their first trimester.</i>

605
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,600
<i>I'm very sorry.
We don't always know the reason why.</i>

606
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,000
<i>It isn't something that you did
and that's important to understand.</i>

607
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,480
<i>The ultrasound shows no uterine damage
so there's no ongoing cause for concern.</i>

608
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,840
<i>I do realise this is
quite difficult to process,</i>

609
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,440
<i>so if you have any questions
I'll try my best to answer them.</i>

610
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,880
<i>Miss Chambers?</i>

611
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,040
Is that it?

612
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,240
Sorry?

613
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,080
You said that.

614
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,960
Can I go now?

615
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,640
Lucy.

616
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,840
Erm, there's no reason
for you to stay here,

617
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,160
but if you would like to
stay a while longer...

618
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,480
No.

619
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,560
Thank you.

620
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,520
Could we...

621
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,160
have a minute?

622
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,560
Yeah. Of course.

623
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,520
You two, take care.

624
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,440
Talk to me.

625
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,840
You know we did IVF.

626
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,400
We what?

627
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,200
We tried for years.

628
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,120
<i>Never worked.</i>

629
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,520
You used to talk about your weak swimmers.

630
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,880
It just wasn't meant to be.

631
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,440
Neither was this. How could it be?

632
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,840
What kind of life would it have?
So it's good.

633
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,600
It's good that it's gone.

634
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,640
It's good that it's gone...

635
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,640
Amir.

636
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,800
If we had a boy,

637
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,560
I would have called him Amir.

638
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,640
What else do you remember?

639
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,440
I don't know what's happening to me.

640
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,760
I do. I do.

641
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,000
And I can make it make sense.

642
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,120
But for now...

643
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,280
you have to let me go.

644
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,840
I can't.

645
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,880
Is there a vending machine?
I really, really need something to eat.

646
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,640
I'll see what I can find.

647
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,840
Thank you.

648
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,360
Yeah?

649
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,360
I've been calling. Where've you been?

650
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,720
<i>Out of range.</i>

651
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,600
We need to talk about Lucy Chambers.

652
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,640
<i>She's more involved in this
than we thought.</i>

653
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,400
What do you have?

654
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,360
<i>It's circumstantial but I think
it's enough to want a DNA test.</i>

655
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,720
We found hair and blood
at Dunn's place, not his.

656
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,240
<i>Ravi?</i>

657
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,680
<i>Ravi, are you still there?</i>

658
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,880
<i>Ravi?!</i>

659
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,000
Okay.

660
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,520
Do what you have to do.

661
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,880
Call me when you find something.

662
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,920
- I have to go.
<i>- Ravi, wait.</i>

663
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,240
Ravi?

664
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,800
Just here, please.

665
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,640
Here you go.

666
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,000
It's out of a can but it's hot.

667
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,400
Best I can offer.

668
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,520
Where's Ravi?

669
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,920
I left him at the hospital.

670
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,280
Are you okay?

671
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,120
No.

672
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,480
But we're safe for now.

673
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,960
Lucy.

674
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,960
Mum?

675
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,000
- I am so sorry.
- Mum!

676
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,400
I couldn't get back to you.

677
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,000
I just couldn't.

678
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,160
But I am here now.

679
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,520
And I see you.

680
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,240
I see you.

681
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,240
I made Grandma better.

682
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,760
Yes, you did.

683
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,680
Nobody move.

684
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,960
Stay where you are.

685
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,560
Sam, what are you doing?

686
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,360
I followed you.

687
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,560
I don't know what's going on here,

688
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,720
but I need everyone to put
their hands on the table and...

689
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,120
Your wife's name is Danielle.

690
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,480
What?

691
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,000
You have a son called George.

692
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,440
He wants to be
a firefighter when he grows up

693
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,560
but he's actually
gonna be a graphic designer.

694
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,800
What are you talking about?

695
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,840
I know this is hard to believe
but I need you to remember.

696
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,760
I need you to understand.

697
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,840
Understand what?

698
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,520
- Stop!
- Sam, don't!

699
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,600
- Get off!
- Mum!

700
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,560
- No, no. No, no, no.
- Don't move!

701
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,040
Aagh! Aagh!

702
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,880
Aargh!

703
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,000
Get off!

704
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,720
Do not move!

705
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,920
Sam, you don't know
what you're doing! Please, stop!

706
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,240
You're insane!

707
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,600
Stay still. Just stay still!

708
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,800
You do not have to say anything,

709
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,640
but it may harm your defence...

710
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,600
Tie her up.
