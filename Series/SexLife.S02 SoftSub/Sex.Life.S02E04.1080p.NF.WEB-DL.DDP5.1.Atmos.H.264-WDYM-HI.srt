[Billie] <i>One of my professors once told me</i>

3
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,481
<i>a therapist can't depend on her patients</i>

4
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,109
<i>to be reliable narrators
of their own lives.</i>

[moaning]

00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,321
<i>Not because they intend to be deceitful,</i>

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,949
<i>but because the human condition is such...</i>

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,287
<i>that we can want things
to be one way so badly,</i>

9
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,249
<i>we aren't honest
about the way they really are.</i>

10
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,587
<i>We can't be honest with others,</i>

11
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,507
<i>because we can't even
be honest with ourselves.</i>

12
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,887
Hey, sleepyhead.

13
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,599
I had fun last night.

14
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:02,353
It was super unexpected,
but in like the best way possible.

15
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,021
[sighs]

16
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,816
It was definitely unexpected.

17
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,904
So, not to be weird or whatever,

18
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:14,157
but The National is playing
Pier 27 on Saturday

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,451
and some friends from NYU are going.

20
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,869
You want to come?

21
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,956
You go to NYU?

22
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,833
Yeah, I'm a junior.

23
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,418
Okay.

24
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,922
I'm gonna go make some coffee.

25
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,972
[Brett] Sweet mother of Jesus.

26
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,017
I had no idea your brother was here.

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,227
Spence, did you know?

28
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,396
No. Who could possibly think
anyone else was here?

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,106
It was so quiet all night.

30
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,525
Mm-hm.

31
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,444
All I heard was the sound of silence.

32
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,695
[moaning]

33
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,657
Ah-ah-ah. All right.

34
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,242
Hey, I'm not complaining.

35
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:01,538
Sounded like you had yourself
a good old time over and over.

36
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,624
I am complaining
because it is not at all disturbing

37
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,127
to hear your baby brother
getting his rocks off.

38
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,294
[door opens]

39
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,921
You have roommates.

40
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,133
Who's your friend, Cooper?

41
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,511
Uh, this is Summer.

42
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,930
Actually, I'm Autumn.

43
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,599
At least he didn't go with Spring, honey.

44
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,394
No big. I didn't remember his name
'til you just said it.

45
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,478
Ooh. I like her.

46
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,646
See you, Coop.

47
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,440
[door opens, then closes]

48
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,776
So, where did you and Autumn meet?

49
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,488
I think she was my Uber driver.

50
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,907
I hope you gave her a five-star rating.

51
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,784
Cooper, what are you doing?

52
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,203
Making up for lost time.
What does it matter to you?

53
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:46,374
This is the first time you spent the night
at our house since you split from Billie.

54
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,419
- You got a random teenager with you.
- Okay.

55
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,503
She's in college.

56
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,007
Shower's calling. Go easy on him, Spence.

57
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,220
You remember Francesca,
your "alleged" girlfriend?

58
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,724
I've never met her before
but she texted me last night repeatedly

59
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,244
saying she hadn't heard from you in days
and was worried sick.

60
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,562
- Shit.
- I covered for you,

61
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,522
but you introduced her to your kids.

62
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,857
What happened?

63
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,028
I had a run-in with Billie.

64
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,114
A couple, actually.

65
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,659
Cooper, you need to take time

66
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,037
to deal with the emotional fallout
from your split.

67
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,955
- I am.
- No, you're not.

68
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,499
You walked out on Billie
and ran straight to Francesca,

69
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,919
and you jumped in with both feet
on the same night.

70
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,295
Divorce is a huge loss.

71
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,589
- It's like a death.
- A death I wanted.

72
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:37,050
Everything I'm doing now is what I want.

73
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,885
Maybe for the first time in my life.

74
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,512
I did the whole
"sex is a salve for your problems" thing,

75
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,515
it works great for 15 minutes,
you feel like the hottest guy.

76
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,684
You forget how much
you fucking hate yourself.

77
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,519
No, I hate her. Not me.

78
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:52,023
Mm-hm. You've never hated anyone.
You've never had a reason to.

79
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,192
Which means you've lived
a pretty charmed life.

80
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,362
It also means now that things
aren't going exactly according to plan,

81
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,905
you don't know how to process.

82
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:04,535
I always knew some good would come out
of being a miserable, closeted gay kid

83
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,579
in uber-heteronormative '90s Connecticut.

84
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,331
It was fucking traumatizing.

85
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,458
But I dealt with my shit

86
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,253
so I could show up
for the rest of my life, including Brett.

87
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,337
Good for you.

88
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,548
Whatever you're going through,
just go through it.

89
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,759
Come out the other end like I did.

90
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,429
Try to minimize collateral damage.

91
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,682
It's not fair
to drag Francesca down with you.

92
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:33,982
Okay, honey, I am gonna miss you so much.

93
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,692
But I hope you have fun with Daddy.

94
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,861
Daddy said he's taking us for sledding
and hot chocolate.

95
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,945
He did?

96
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,823
That's great.

97
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:45,952
Yoo-hoo! Carpool's arrived.

98
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,453
Do you like my tiara?

99
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,957
It is my birthday tiara
and I'm going to wear it all day

100
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,126
even at my Manhattan spa party.

101
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,544
Are you as excited as I am?

102
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,339
Caroline, I am so sorry,
I don't think I'll be able to make it.

103
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,925
It's been a crazy few days.

104
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,512
Well, Hudson, why don't you
go jump in the car with Hannah,

105
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,389
and I will be right there.

106
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,472
Okay.

107
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,309
- Bye.
- Bye, sweetheart.

108
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,025
I know what happened
with Cooper and Trina.

109
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:22,697
And I think that you and Trina need to
talk it out in a relaxed environment.

110
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,657
Like a spa.

111
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,618
- No.
- You can't avoid each other forever.

112
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,203
Not in Greenwich, anyway.

113
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,665
Besides... it's my birthday

114
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,543
and I want my two besties
there to celebrate me.

115
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,088
Pretty, pretty, pretty, please.

116
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,298
Okay, fine.

117
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,381
Yay!

118
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,928
Oh, P.S., I saw the news this morning
about your sexy ex.

119
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,181
It's so sad what's happening to him.

120
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,515
What are you talking about?

121
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,767
The lawsuit.

122
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,018
What?

123
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,227
Oh.

124
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,693
I mean, at least it's a nice picture.

125
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,613
He is so photogenic.

126
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,788
Sash, what's with the getup?

127
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,708
This is what it's like when you're
top of Twitter's 10 Most Hated.

128
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,753
One second I'm talking
about Kam's magic penis

129
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,505
and the next, I'm anti-feminist?

130
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,548
It's ridiculous but it'll blow over.

131
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,343
- It's a 60-second news cycle these days.
- Yeah.

132
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:29,680
And, hey, at least
I'm not being sued for $450 million.

133
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,973
Oh, my God. Right?

134
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,558
I still can't believe it.

135
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,604
I mean, I'm sure Brad's totally innocent.

136
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,356
Of course you think that.

137
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,692
Brad loved his artists like family.
He would never steal from them.

138
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,779
Even that article
said it was that guy, Ron Shelby,

139
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,156
who did the actual embezzling.
Do you remember him?

140
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,785
I always had a bad feeling about him.
I even told Brad that when he hired him.

141
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:54,747
Plus, he shaved his arms.
Never trust a man who shaves his arms.

142
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,290
Brad must be devastated.

143
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,376
I wish there was something I could do.

144
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,379
Uh, yeah, that definitely falls
under the category of...

145
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,172
Not my sink, not my dishes?

146
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,216
I was gonna say,
not your garden, not your weeds,

147
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,676
but same thing.

148
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,759
I know.

149
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,388
Maybe I should reach out to him.

150
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:15,268
Do you not remember how hard it was
seeing him and his wife at Majid's party?

151
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,813
I really think
I have to put all that stuff to the side.

152
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:22,775
That business is cutthroat.
People can turn on you in a second.

153
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:27,363
You know, he probably
needs a friend right now.

154
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,073
You're gonna be his friend?

155
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,450
He'd do it for me.

156
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,120
And he would do it for you too, Sash.
You know that.

157
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,413
Okay, fine.

158
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,542
Are you sure you
aren't wanting to reach out to Brad

159
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,461
'cause you're in a bad place with Majid?

160
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,838
We're not in a bad place.

161
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,090
We're in no place.

162
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,302
He hasn't reached out since the party
and neither have I.

163
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,387
I haven't even had time to think about it.

164
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,307
- This is my first day back in the city.
- I know.

165
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,517
It's gonna be what it's gonna be.

166
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:01,481
But me reaching out to Brad
has nothing to do with Majid.

167
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,609
I'm gonna text him.

168
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,990
Hey.

169
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,618
Hey.

170
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,620
Do you want me
to cancel my shoot and stay?

171
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,373
I'm happy to.
I want to support you in any way I can.

172
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,834
It'll all be fine. I'm gonna beat this.

173
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,044
Of course you are.

174
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,714
You're Brad Simon,
you always come out on top.

[cell phone chimes]

176
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:34,971
What is it?

177
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,894
It's nothing. Just...

178
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,563
It's just one of the lawyers.

179
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,651
Listen...

180
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,656
I'm not just here
for the good times, okay?

181
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,951
I want you to know
you can lean on me all the time.

182
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,661
I'm your wife.

183
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,086
Don't forget to eat.

184
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,381
I won't.

185
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,634
You have a good shoot, okay?

186
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,824
Nothing.

187
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,159
A least someone has good boundaries.

188
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,747
Oh, wait. He's writing back.

189
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,126
He wants to meet.

190
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,460
Oh, for fuck's sake.

191
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,920
I have to be there for him.

192
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,839
It's the right thing to do.

193
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,605
His loft.

194
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,149
You know what?

195
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,820
I have enough of a clusterfuck of my own
to deal with today.

196
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,406
Have fun being Brad's friend.

197
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:18,034
I'm sure that's gonna be
super easy for you.

198
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,473
[Brad] Thanks for coming.

199
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,269
- For reaching out.
- Of course. Yeah.

200
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,856
Where's, um, Gigi?

201
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,690
She's...

202
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,235
She's on a shoot.

203
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,572
Do you want a coffee?

204
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,490
- Sure.
- Yeah.

205
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,616
Yeah.

206
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,170
[moaning]

207
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,936
You have a new couch.

208
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,355
It's pink.

209
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,399
It's blush.

210
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,859
I was assured of that.

211
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,571
And you're a Buddhist now.

212
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,324
Uh, Gigi got it.

213
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,451
She's made a few changes here.

214
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,121
[Billie] I can see that.

215
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,334
Thank you.

216
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,339
You wanna sit?

217
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,133
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

218
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:11,105
You were the first person I wanted to call
when it all happened.

219
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,443
You always warned me about Ron.

220
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,238
I really fucked up. I...

221
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,701
I wasn't overseeing the day-to-day
the way I should have.

222
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,120
I knew Ron was tough...

223
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,291
but I had no idea he was stealing.
I swear.

224
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,876
Of course you didn't.

225
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,753
I should've listened to you.

226
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,176
You've always known what's good for me.

227
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,761
Before I know it myself.

228
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,266
I'm always coming around too late.

229
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,439
I think I'm gonna lose the company.

230
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,569
I don't know who I am without it.

231
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:00,778
Brad...

232
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,241
You are not your company.

233
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:09,163
I know how much it means to you
and meant to you for your dad.

234
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,999
But you made all that right
before he passed.

235
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,793
There is so much more to you
than your success.

236
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,088
I'm about to be a father, Billie.

237
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,092
And I'm scared to death.

238
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,136
The money...

239
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,225
was the one thing
I knew I had going for me.

240
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,310
You know?

241
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,146
I knew, if nothing else, I...

242
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,486
I could provide for my son.

243
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,196
But now...

244
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,577
You're gonna be a great father.

245
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,456
I've always known that.

246
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:57,169
Whether it happened with us or with Gigi.

247
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,800
That little boy is lucky...

248
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,052
to have you as his dad.

249
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,306
You don't want to do this.

250
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:54,934
Maybe I do.

251
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,483
Well, I don't.

252
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:09,949
I can't.

253
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,915
You've always been right about me too.

254
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,337
This isn't who I am, who I want to be.

255
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,632
This is not who you are either.

256
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,272
[new age music playing over speakers]

257
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,482
Hello, Mick.

258
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,692
Oh.

259
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,445
I'm sorry.

260
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,864
Your assistant said you wanted to meet.

261
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,948
Sit down.

262
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:55,245
As I predicted,
your brand is bleeding out.

263
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,457
Got a Dr. Evans problem
you got to fix, stat.

264
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,210
I know, but I'm sure
it's all gonna blow over.

265
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,880
It's a 60-second news cycle
these days, right?

266
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,842
Besides, I have been
preparing some inspired

267
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,596
hashtag "IndependentWoman4Life" posts
that are gonna slay.

[mimics buzzer]

269
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,850
Not gonna cut it.
This is your personal Chernobyl.

270
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,812
You need to put on your hazmat suit
and clean this shit up.

271
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:23,357
You're writing a book called <i>Unattached.</i>
You gotta be unattached.

272
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,525
[Sasha] Okay, I hear you.

273
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:28,362
But here's another idea just to chew on.

274
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,947
What if I push back,

275
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:34,368
make Kam eat a little crow
so that we're reframing the issue to:

276
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,579
"Sasha Snow has got her man in check."

277
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,125
- It's good.
- It's shit.

278

Independent Woman for Life

279
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:47,006
rehabs some douchebag who shuts her up
in front of 4 million viewers?

280
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:51,468
Okay. That hand-over-mouth thing
was taken way out of context.

281
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,178
We were just joking around.

282
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,054
We're done.

283
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,723
[music stops]

284
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,982
Perception... is reality.

285
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,236
I was just on the phone
with <i>Goop Lab's</i> executive producer

286
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,447
pitching you for a regular segment.

287
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,242
She was practically
creaming her panties over the idea.

288
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,827
Oh, my God.

289
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,039
That's amazing.

290
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,624
Yeah, well, it's only a dress rehearsal.

291
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,919
You could be Gwyneth's Dr. Phil...

292
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,756
but you gotta do things my way.

293
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,340
I'm an independent woman.

294
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,135
Isn't it my job to question you?

295
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,431
Sally, get me Amanda Gorman on the phone.

296
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,310
I was just playing.

297
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,564
I really wanna make this work.

298
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,983
Then 86 the boyfriend.

299
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,402
- [Sally] <i>I have Amanda.</i>
- Amanda.

Poet! Renaissance woman of the century!

301
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,656
You ever hear of Goop?

302
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,370
Billie.

303
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,914
I'm so sorry I'm late.

304
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,833
I just... I got held up at, uh, school.

305
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,965
Well, all that matters is you're here now

306
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,303
and I scheduled some
amazing spa treatments for us,

307
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:21,266
including massages with
my favorite masseur of all time, Sven.

308
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,477
- Oh!
- That's his real name.

309
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,062
Wow. Can't wait.

310
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,482
Caroline, I have your room ready.

311
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,150
- Just how you like it.
- Great.

312
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:35,739
He knows I love a warm massage table
with a couple drops of eucalyptus oil.

313
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,242
See you later.

314
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:41,911
Billie...

315
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,665
I'm so sorry.

316
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,459
- I've been trying to reach you.
- I know.

317
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,464
- I just...
- [Helen] Billie and Trina?

318
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,716
Hi. I'm Helen,

319
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,637
and I am taking you for your
restorative couple's seaweed wrap.

320
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,348
Oh, no, no, no, no. We're not a couple.

321
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,853
This is a judgment free space. Follow me.

322
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:10,983
Hey, Ben.

323
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:16,071
Sorry, Cooper, but I have instructions
from Francesca not to let you up.

324
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,995
Could you please call her
and let her know I'm here?

325
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,372
Don't you want to call her yourself?

326
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,168
I think it'll be better if you do it.

327
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,551
Now, hand me your robes.

328
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,431
Ladies, we're all women of the earth here

329
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,810
and shedding our cloaks
is part of the cleansing process. Just...

330
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:52,274
[exhales sharply]
Good. Very good. Thank you.

331
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,193
Now, take the seaweed.

332
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:59,656
Go ahead. Take it and gently rub it
onto the front of your bodies.

333
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,368
Very good. Yes, Just like that.

334
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,455
And make sure to cover all the areas.

335
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,625
Really feel the curative effects
of that seaweed

336
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,878
as it draws out those toxins

337
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,965
and releases all of that negative energy.

338
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,385
[yelling] Release that energy. Release!

339
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,893
[in normal voice]
I want you to do each other's backs.

340
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:28,894
That's okay.

341
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,188
I have really long arms, I can reach.

342
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:35,984
No, no, no. Open yourselves up
to each other's restorative touch.

343
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,738
Hmm? I'll be back in a few minutes.

344
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,205
Is it okay to use
my restorative touch on you?

345
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,207
I hear it works wonders.

346
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,254
Honestly, it'll help
if I don't have to look you in the eye

347
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,130
when I say what I have to say to you.

348
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,801
Have at it.

349
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,518
I am so truly sorry...

350
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,477
and...

351
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:13,854
ashamed...

352
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,441
of what happened with Cooper

353
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,443
and especially Hudson.

354
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,527
Is he okay?

355
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,032
We convinced him
you two were playing a game.

356
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,327
He's young enough that he bought it.

357
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,372
I'm really glad.

358
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,585
What I did was not to hurt you.

359
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,838
I need you to know that.

360
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,382
I've just been...

361
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:47,139
so envious of you for having the guts
to go after your own happiness

362
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:51,059
when I don't even have the foggiest idea
what would make me happy.

363
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,603
What are you talking about?

364
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:59,526
Turns out the sex parties
were just a distraction

365
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,611
from what was happening in my marriage...

366
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,865
or what wasn't happening.

367
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,328
I tried going back to work. Like you.

368
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,166
Honestly, I'm grasping at straws,

369
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,335
and Cooper was one of those straws.

370
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,545
Trina.

371
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,257
You should not be envious of me.

372
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,427
I don't have anything figured out.

373
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,720
Not by a mile.

374
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,430
You made such bold choices.

375
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,016
You didn't just stay silent,

376
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,642
do what we're all supposed to do,

377
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,853
keep our mouths shut and act grateful.

378
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,899
You can make bold choices too, you know.

379
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:44,946
And I will be here
to help you in any way that I can.

380
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,408
[Helen] Okay, ladies.

381
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:52,287
Are we ready to rinse
all that negative energy away?

382
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,832
Yes, Helen. Let's rinse that shit away.

383
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,588
[Francesca] Cooper.

384
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,757
Here's your shit. We're done.

385
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,052
What the hell is he doing here?
The receptionist's not enough for you?

386
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,971
Got big cojones coming at me
given what you did with my wife.

387
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,599
I called Devon after you went MIA.

388
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,060
I called everyone
because I thought you were dead.

389
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:18,772
But after the earful I got from him,
you may as well be.

390
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:22,692
- Can we talk in private? Just you and me.
- No, he stays.

391
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:27,489
I want you to be humiliated
the same way you humiliated me.

392
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,117
Okay.

393
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,285
I'm sorry.

394
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:38,667
I jumped in with both feet too soon

395
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,504
and I hadn't processed all of
the unresolved baggage with Billie and me.

396
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,506
And I'm sorry
you got caught in the middle.

397
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,589
In the middle?

398
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,762
I thought we were
building a life together.

399
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,973
I lost my job because of you.

400
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:56,852
Now I'm unhireable because
you made me the whore of Wall Street.

401
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,980
I'm so sorry, Francesca.

402
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,654
The truth is, it wasn't just Trina.

403
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,073
There were others.

404
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,285
There was a woman
at the Chinese restaurant.

405
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,912
Oh, my God.

406
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,664
My Uber driver last night.

407
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,291
Dude.

408
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:23,378
I'm just... I'm fucked up right now. Okay?

409
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:26,214
I used to think Billie was the problem
in your marriage,

410
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,841
but maybe I had it wrong.

411
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,385
Maybe the problem is you.

412
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,431
- So, what can I do to make it right?
- You could've talked to me.

413
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,309
You could've told me
any part of what was going on.

414
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,936
But you did nothing. You said nothing.

415
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,856
This is private property.

416
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,193
Take your shit and get out.

417
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,530
Francesca, wait.

418
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,972
[Caroline sighs] I feel like a new woman.

419
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,685
How was your seaweed wrap?
You and Trina make up?

420
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:22,728
Yeah.

421
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,439
I think we did.

422
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,774
- Yay!
- Mm-hm.

423
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,069
I knew Helen would clear out
all of that bad energy.

424
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,321
She is very insistent about that.

425
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,489
Mm.

426
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,367
So...

427
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,162
have you talked to bad boy Brad
about the lawsuit?

428
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,998
No. Why would I?

429
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,750
- We're not together.
- I know.

430
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,753
But you never said why you're not.

431
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,047
Brad had such a pull on you.

432
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,049
I was so excited for what might happen.

433
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:54,010
I used to lie in bed thinking about
what your life was like now.

434
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,721
- Let me tell you...
- [Trina] What the hell, Caroline.

435
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,975
Your sick fuck of a masseur, Sven,
just tried to go down on me.

436
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,518
- What?
- Are you serious?

437
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,937
Yeah. I'm about to go report
his ass to management.

438
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,940
- No, no, no, you can't.
- Why not?

439
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:09,526
Did he try something on you too, Caroline?

440
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,363
Uh...

441
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,324
Okay, um...

442
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,620
Yes, he did.

443
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,164
And I let him.

444
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,793
In fact, I let him about once a month.

445
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,796
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I'm sorry.

446
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,090
I didn't realize
he was doing that with everyone.

447
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,259
I thought it was our special thing.

448
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,637
He probably thought he was doing
you a favor like he has been for me.

449
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,641
Okay, Caroline, I don't understand.

450
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,352
You always seemed
so happy in your marriage.

451
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,856
I am happy. I love Jeffrey.

452
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,483
But you said
I need to start questioning my life.

453
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,235
Oh, my God. So this is on me now?

454
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,072
No. I was inspired...
to figure out why I don't like sex.

455
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,743
Well, it turns out I do like sex.
I like sex a lot.

456
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,412
Just not with my husband.

457
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,874
Please don't report him.

458
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,002
Don't ruin this for me.

459
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,922
[woman on intercom]
<i>There's a delivery here</i>

460
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,299
<i>that requires your signature.</i>

461
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,717
Send him in.

462
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,348
[pop music playing]

463
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,641
Special delivery for Dr. Evans.

468
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,961
I was told a signature would be required.

469
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,007
I'm certain you'll leave your signature.

470
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
All...

471
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,803
over...

472
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,263
me.

473
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,413
You know these walls are paper thin.

474
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,166
Then you better not scream too loud.

475
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,633
Have fun being a patient, Dr. Evans.

476
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,803
[both moaning]

477
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,478
Well, the scent of eucalyptus
is forever ruined for me.

478
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,064
Oh, he gave you the eucalyptus too?

479
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,942
Listen, um...

480
00:28:56,651 --> 00:29:02,490
I know on some level
I should be... flattered.

481
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,702
I mean, you both are making
some really big decisions

482
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:09,706
based on... me and my life choices, but...

483
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,126
I'm not so sure that's a good idea.

484
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,210
[Caroline] Why not?

485
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,090
I did go see Brad today.

486
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,175
[gasps]

487
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,011
- Did something happen?
- It almost did.

488
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,513
I wanted it to.

489
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,099
But...

490
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,771
- I have a boyfriend.
- A boyfriend?

491
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,105
That's so exciting.

492
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,817
Well, I mean,
things are a little weird right now.

493
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,319
Because you still love Brad?

494
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:40,944
Brad is married.

495
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,282
He and his wife are about to have a baby.

496
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:47,035
No. That's so sad.

497
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,246
I mean, happy for them.
A child is a blessing.

498
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,539
But sad for you...

499
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,626
- and also me.
- [cell phone chimes]

500
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,923
- Oh, shit.
- [Trina] What's wrong?

501
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,006
Who is it?

502
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,511
Brad's wife.

503
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,599
[Kam] I know the last few days
have been rough,

504
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:13,019
but I'm happy to report
you still got your swagger.

505
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,940
But speaking of which,

506
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:22,654
Mick called me in to discuss
how to stop the hemorrhaging.

507
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,322
Like a Twitter tourniquet.

508
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:29,953
Actually, we decided
I should break up with you.

509
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,164
- Publicly.
- You're breaking up with me?

510
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,959
No, of course not.

511
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,796
We can keep seeing each other
just in private.

512
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,172
In secret?

513
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:45,885
Hey, secrecy... can be really hot.

514
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,429
Oh, my God.

515
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,016
That's why you came and seduced me.

516
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,978
To soften me up before lowering the boom.

517
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,563
That's not what this is.

518
00:30:56,646 --> 00:31:00,817
No, this is you sacrificing
your integrity for your brand.

519
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:07,282
I have to do whatever it takes
to expand my platform,

520
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,659
to teach women to fight back
against the patriarchy

521
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,744
and live the way they want to.
You know that.

522
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,954
Whatever it takes, huh?

523
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,123
My next book is called <i>Unattached.</i>

524
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,125
Your agent came up with that title,
not you.

525
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,712
It's a good fucking title
because it describes who I am,

526
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:24,549
who I've been for the last 17 years
before you showed up again.

527
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,551
But it's not who you are now.

528
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,095
Like it or not, you have a partner.

529
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,178
As of last week,

530
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,433
you were telling me how sustained you felt
by that partnership.

531
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,227
- Why don't you tell that to your fans?
- I will.

532
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,022
My next book can be about that.
I can be honest then.

533
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,482
Sasha, look around.

534
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:46,362
My whole career has been built
on living a life of integrity.

535
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,616
How could you possibly expect me to cosign

536
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,577
on selling some bullshit reality?

537
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,953
Oh, I see.

538
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,037
We're back to that.

539
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,041
Your career,
which always comes before mine.

540
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,208
Mm-mm. Stop.

541
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:04,380
That is not what this is.
I'm just not gonna live a lie.

542
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,634
I love you, Sasha Snow.

543
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,305
But you've got a decision to make.

544
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,936
["Cheers to Poison" playing]

545
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,482
[man] Elongate your torso.

546
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,818
All right. Chin up.
Yes. A little to the right.

547
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:26,778
Little to the left.

548
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,321
Beautiful. Okay.

549
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,032
Chin down a tiny bit.
Straight into the lens.

550
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,034
Right. Love that.

551
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,578
All right, legs up. Arch your back.

552
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,207
You're exquisite.

553
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,672
Sorry, Nino, I need ten.

554
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,755
[Nino] Okay.

555
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:02,605
Gigi, wow. You're gorgeous.

556
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,857
I know you were at the loft earlier.

557
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:09,320
I get notifications on my phone with
camera footage when someone buzzes up.

558
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,281
What were you doing there?

559
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,034
Oh, I just reached out
when I heard the news.

560
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,828
I wanted to make sure Brad was okay.

561
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,997
And then he asked you
to come over to our home,

562
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,082
that I'm getting ready for our baby.

563
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
As a friend.

564
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:33,052
You are the ghost in our relationship
and I think you always will be.

565
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,137
No, Gigi.

566
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,431
I only recently put it together
but I get it now.

567
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,183
You left your husband.

568
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,269
But by that time,
Brad was already with me.

569
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,897
So the only reason
you two aren't together is this baby.

570
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:45,981
That's not true.

571
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,819
Brad loves you.
That has never been a question.

572
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:50,903
I'm not an idiot.

573
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,282
I saw you both at the party.

574
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,868
How affected you were by each other.

575
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,121
I asked Brad not to contact you again.

576
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,623
But he couldn't help himself.

577
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,708
Look...

578
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,669
Brad is going through a lot.

579
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,754
Oh, I'm aware.

580
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,423
And you have no idea how it feels

581
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,217
to know that you're the one
he wants to talk to about this.

582
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,972
[sobbing] Shit. I can't fuck this up,
it's a $10,000 makeup job.

583
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,183
No, no. Okay, hold on.

584
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,352
Here you go.

585
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,865
You've had your chance.

586
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,993
Now it's my turn.

587
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,330
Please, let me have it.

588
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,927
[cell phone buzzing]

589
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:57,678
[groans]

590
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,351
Hey, Olga.

591
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:07,271
Hey, I was just calling to see
how much longer you're going to be.

592
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,900
Hudson says you're going sledding
and getting hot chocolate.

593
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,111
Oh... shit.

594
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,194
<i>I got, um...</i>

595
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:18,574
I got stuck at work
and I lost track of time.

596
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,454
Daddy says he's so sorry.

597
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,581
He loves you
and he'll see you in the morning.

598
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,917
Yeah, that.

599
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,588
Thank you, Olga.

600
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,094
[whistles]

601
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,265
I'll take another one, please.

602
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,475
Sorry, man. I gotta cut you off.

603
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,685
Happy to call you a cab.

604
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,897
I don't need a fucking cab.
I just need another drink.

605
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:51,815
Not my rules.

606
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,070
Okay.

607
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,784
Your job is to pour.

608
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,536
So, pour.

609
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,539
Do your fucking job.

610
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,293
You want me to come back there
and show you how to do it?

611
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,711
Cooper.

612
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,964
[Cooper] Emily?

613
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,886
What are you doing here?

614
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:23,890
I was getting drinks with some colleagues
and I saw you.

615
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,183
Oh.

616
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,019
Here, sit down.

617
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,102
Sit down.

618
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,439
Maybe you can get this guy
to get us a drink.

619
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,024
I can only stay a moment.

620
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,236
I heard you're getting divorced.

621
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,032
Oh.

622
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,532
Yep.

623
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,535
That's me.

624
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,872
- Mr. Failed Marriage.
- Don't do that to yourself.

625
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,583
No one ever tells you
how hard this part is.

626
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,837
For months, my standing Postmates order

627
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,089
was an avocado toast
and a fifth of Grey Goose.

628
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,717
Plus a straw.

629
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,220
Classy. I know.

630
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:09,101
Going through a divorce
can make you doubt yourself,

631
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,353
your choices.

632
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,647
You start to feel like a fraud.

633
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,899
Yeah. Except maybe I am.

634
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:17,859
The fraud.

635
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,531
I mean, the woman I've been seeing
would definitely agree.

636
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,367
And Billie.

637
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,495
Maybe they're both right.

638
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,578
Maybe...

639
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,543
Maybe I'm not the man
that I always thought I was.

640
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,379
No.

641
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,467
I've known you for a long time, Cooper.

642
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:45,805
Long before there ever was a Billie,
let alone this other woman.

643
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,724
I know your heart.

644
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,728
I know who you are. And...

645
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,482
I've always loved that man.

646
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,285
No. Not like this.

647
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,666
I know you'll find your way
back to yourself, but I can't.

648
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,419
I can't be here for this part.

649
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,767
[cell phone chimes]

650
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,657
[cell phone ringing]

651
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,294
[Majid] Billie.

652
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,483
How'd you know
I was a sucker for amaryllis?

653
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,568
Did you think these were for you?

654
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,070
I'm just selling these.

655
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,113
Sir, care to buy some flowers?

656
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,286
What are you doing here?

657
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,081
Yeah. So...

658
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:41,629
It actually took me a few days
to work up the courage to reach out.

659
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:47,218
Considered just letting the whole thing go
rather than... confessing.

660
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,221
It was like,
if I don't tell her, we're done.

661
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,932
If I do tell her,
we're probably done anyway.

662
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,141
Tell me what, Maj?

663
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,562
You were right.

664
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,190
You have been
unflinchingly honest with me,

665
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:04,068
so I know I need to just man up
and do the same.

666
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:08,030
Crystal was one of my original investors.

667
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:12,201
I'd been scraping pennies together,
raising money for a long time,

668
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:16,038
finally thought I had enough
to put a down payment on the space.

669
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:20,668
But then in the 11th hour,
the last piece of financing fell apart.

670
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,380
I didn't want to ask my family.

671
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:27,799
I couldn't.

672
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,634
So...

673
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,389
A buddy introduced me to Crystal

674
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,600
and she came through,
but there was a string attached.

675
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,855
I have sex with her.

676
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:46,193
That's... been the arrangement.

677
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,696
I haven't been with her since I met you.

678
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,906
I've been putting her off for months.

679
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,618
But the other night at the restaurant,
I knew I had to talk to her.

680
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,704
I shouldn't have let it
get as far as it did.

681
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,999
But after you left,
I spoke to her and I drew the line.

682
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:03,043
She is very clear on my boundaries now.

683
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:09,008
So, I was hoping maybe you
could give me another chance.

684
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,055
It's okay.

685
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,517
I get it.

686
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:24,315
I never would have forgiven myself
if I hadn't taken the chance. So...

687
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,488
Wait.

688
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,620
I know what it's like...

689
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,915
to want something so much...

690
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,086
you'll go after it,
no matter the consequences.

691
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,592
I saw Brad today.

692
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,429
I reached out under the...

693
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,724
guise of concern about the lawsuit.

694
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,142
But the truth is...

695
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:03,854
I wanted to see him.

696
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,108
Nothing happened.

697
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:12,988
But it almost did.

698
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,031
So...

699
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,535
Look, we're both adults.

700
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,497
We both have pasts.

701
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,793
And it would be naive
to pretend that we didn't.

702
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:34,969
