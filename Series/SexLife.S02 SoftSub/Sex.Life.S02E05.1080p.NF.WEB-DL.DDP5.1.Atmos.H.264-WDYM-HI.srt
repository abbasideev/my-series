00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,378
I'm gonna let you two talk
and I will call you later.

181
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,461
Yup.

182
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,591
[Billie] I wanted to, um...

183
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,843
To check-in.

184
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,055
That was pretty intense.

185
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,724
At least for me.

186
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,813
I know this isn't
what either of us hoped for...

187
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,606
Um...

188
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,194
But we can't judge our marriage...

189
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,531
by the worst things that we did.

190
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,534
And we can't judge each other,

191
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,245
or ourselves, that way either.

192
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,706
We have to honor all the beautiful moments

193
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,333
to keep them alive.

194
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,795
For our kids' sake, if nothing else.

195
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,548
They should know who we are.

196
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,925
They should know who we were together.

197
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,229
I can't think about it, Billie. All right?

198
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,400
I'm not gonna make it if I do.

199
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,485
Oh, Cooper, please.

200
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,530
I mean, if you keep
pushing all of this down,

201
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,324
then it's only gonna come back
to hurt you even more.

202
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,702
Thanks, doc. I'll take my chances.

203
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,246
Okay, look, we can't leave it like this.

204
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,499
See, actually, we can.
That is the beauty of the day.

205
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,377
Everything's figured out,
so we don't ever have to talk again.

206
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,171
Okay, yes, we do.

207
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,757
I'm sorry to have to bring this up
today of all days,

208
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,676
but it's happening this afternoon.

209
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,595
So, I, uh...

210
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,556
I've been seeing someone.

211
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,641
His name is Majid Mousavi.

212
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,935
He owns a restaurant in Manhattan.

213
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,479
It's gotten serious,

214
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,106
and I want him to meet the kids.

215
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,692
We decided that it would be...

216
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,569
today.

217
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,905
Oh, you decided, huh?

218
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,493
Hey, I mean, I guess if it's today,

219
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,953
well, then I don't get a choice, right?

220
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,289
But thanks for the FYI.

221
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,540
[car horn honking]

222
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,128
Yo! Connelly!

223
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,422
Happy fucking divorce, buddy.

224
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,757
Let freedom ring.

225
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,383
Hi, Billie.

226
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,762
Come on, get in the car.
Let's blow this joint.

227
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,472
Cooper.

228
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,557
[hip-hop music playing over stereo]

229
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,688
Have a great afternoon.

230
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,981
Cooper.

231
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,194
Hell is this thing?

232
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,947
This is a mid-engine Corvette Stingray.

233
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,491
Goes 0 to 60 in 2.9 seconds.

234
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,327
And it still cannot get me
away from Trina fast enough.

235
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,955
Look, I know I tried to sleep with Franny.

236
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,748
Multiple times.

237
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:53,958
Never got in.

238
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,835
And you never got to finish with Trina,

239
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,754
at least this time. So it's a lose-lose.

240
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,464
We're even, no apologies,

241
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,758
because husbands say they're sorry,

242
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,262
but real men, we say, "Suck on it."

243
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,388
Let's go.

244
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:10,975
I don't know, Dev.

245
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,019
I'm not really
in a party mood right now. The...

246
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,438
divorce has been brutal.

247
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,732
Oh, divorce is awesome.

248
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,110
Best money you ever spent. Come on.

249
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,696
We got the rocket ship
to go anywhere we want.

250
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,698
Say goodbye to misery.

251
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,701
Say, "Hello, gorgeous,"
to the greatest night of our lives.

252
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,370
It's over, dude.

253
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,081
You hung on way longer than you should've.

254
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,792
Now you gotta make up for lost time.

255
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:40,880
Let's do it.

256
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,256
Now we're talking.

257
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,970
- Got you a parting gift.
- Oh, Dev.

258
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,057
<i>Buon appetito.</i>

259
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,859
[Billie moaning]

260
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,790
Fuck it.

261
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,044
Yeah.

262
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,296
Buckle up, baby!

263
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,423
We're going to Disneyland!

264
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,506
[tires squealing]

265
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:34,183
Sash, these last three months
have been amazing. Your brand is on fire.

266
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,476
Single Girl Cruises,

267
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,646
Third Way Education Vacations,
Girls Night Out across the country.

268
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,981
Plus, the lingerie line
is through the roof.

269
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,610
And the new vibrator sold out on Amazon.

270
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:45,693
Amazing.

271
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,031
I'm glad my message is getting out there.

272
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,658
And Mick wants to talk.

273
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,661
He's thinking about doing
the new book as a stealth release.

274
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,622
Just dropping it online,
kind of like <i>Lemonade.</i>

275
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,669
It's not gonna be free,
don't worry about that.

276
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,171
Right.

277
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,466
But, boom, once it's out there,
we jam it into all the book clubs.

278
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:12,638
Oprah, Reese, Jenna Bush,
Emma Watson, Kaia Gerber.

279
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,806
What's happening?

280
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,058
Do you see a celeb?

281
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,644
Oh, no.

282
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:22,982
I saw Dua Lipa here last week.
She is so skinny.

283
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,193
We have the same Prada mini bag.

284
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,654
- Dua Lipa. Cool.
- Mm-hm.

285
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,200
[Sasha sighs] Um...

286
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,454
You know what?
This wine is running right through me.

287
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,666
- I'm just gonna use the ladies' room.
- Yeah.

288
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,209
- Be right back.
- Okay.

289
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,352
Oh, my God. Kam?

290
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,229
Sasha.

291
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,024
How are you?

292
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,650
Great.

293
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,027
How's your new book coming?

294
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,364
Almost done.
Already planning the next tour.

295
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,532
Everything's...

296
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,618
really good.

297
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,747
Well, glad to see you're so happy.

298
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,165
Take care.

299
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,128
I miss you.

300
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,678
Sorry.

301
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,306
I know you're on a date.

302
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,269
She's a colleague.

303
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,981
I'm helping her with a speech
she's giving at the UN.

304
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,359
Wow, impressive.

305
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,527
[woman] Sash?

306
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,115
I thought you said the doc was done.

307
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,451
You better hope Mick doesn't find out.

308
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,624
Really sorry about that.

309
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,292
Just like old times.

310
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,876
Look...

311
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,631
I know you don't owe me anything.

312
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:16,095
Do you think we could get a drink
and talk?

313
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,974
Someplace not by a bathroom
while people are waiting for us.

314
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,685
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important,

315
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,978
but...

316
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,898
I need this.

317
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,488
Why is Majid your boyfriend
and not your friend?

318
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,534
Well, he's my friend and my boyfriend.

319
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,329
Does he have kids or a dog?
Does he know Daddy?

320
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,331
No, no, honey.

321
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,542
He does not know Daddy.

322

323
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,755

I'm so excited to see you.

It's like I'm even more
turned on knowing...

327
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,304
And you're on speakerphone!

328
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,931

- Ah.

00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,015
<i>Sorry!</i>

00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,518
Hey there, Hudson and Ellary.

331
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,813
We're gonna have an awesome time today.
I cannot wait to meet you.

332
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,648
Okay.

333
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:14,736
All right then,
we'll see you soon, boyfriend.

334
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,946
<i>See you, baby.</i>

335
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,075
Why did he call you a baby?

336
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,917
- Smell that?
- Mm-hm.

337
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,837
That is the scent of possibility,
my friend.

338
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,840
Suck it in all the way down to your balls.

339
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,341
Oh, yeah.

340
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,389
My man, two shots of Patron
and you're going to keep them coming.

341
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:48,437
Aw, shit. I'm missing this presentation
with Deutsche Bank.

342
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,232
Oh, dude, tell Heinrich and Gandalf
to <i>küss deinen</i> ass!

343
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,027
- You know what, you're right.
- Yeah.

344
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,737
Fuck it. Cheers.

345
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,032
To never having to visit
with Trina's awful parents

346
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,951
in fucking Toledo ever again.

347
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,495
Here's to never having to pretend

348
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,706
that the craziest lingerie outfit
she wears

349
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,349
don't make her look like a total whore.

350
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,126
- [groans]
- Cheers to that.

351
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,210
All right.

352
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,715
We gotta figure out
your divorce bucket list, right?

353
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,301
All the shit you're gonna do
with your newfound freedom.

354
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,803
- Top three. Go.
- No, I don't know!

355
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,933
I'm gonna get...
I'm gonna get a bachelor pad in the city.

356
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,310
- Yeah.
- With a big screen TV.

357
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,355
I'm gonna watch the game
whenever the hell I want

358
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,107
without anyone trying to fuck me
in the middle of it.

359
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,442
Come on, bigger!

360
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,525
[groans]

361
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:42,783
Yeah, I'm gonna learn to surf
in the Maldives.

362
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,160
- Bigger!
- I'm gonna go to space.

363
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,663
- There you go.
- With fucking Musk and Bezos.

364
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,915
I'll find that roadster
he launched up there.

365
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,833
I'm gonna drive that bitch around Mars.

366
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:56,380
Or we can just find some chicks
to shag here tonight, right?

367
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,048
Yes, on Mars.

368
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,261
Dude, trust me,
ditching she-who-shall-not-be-named

369
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,722
is going to be the best decision
you've ever made in your life, all right?

370
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,058
Do you have any more that coke?
Did we bring that?

371
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:13,397
Easy, space cowboy,
how about we just examine our prospects?

372
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,276
- Ooh.
- Mm-hm.

373
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,820
I got dibs on the redhead.

374
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,364
Fine. You can have her first.

375
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,954
Bottle of Cristal, four glasses.

376
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,747
[bartender] Yes, sir. Coming right up.

377
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,042
Ladies.

378
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,585
Who's up for some champers?

379
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,211
Sure.

380
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,465
I'm Piper, this is Bianca.

381
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,426
What are we celebrating?

382
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,428
Freedom.

383
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,721
[all chuckling]

384
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,390
Hey, free man. Is it snowing out?

385
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,064
Any more where that came from?

386
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,276
Why don't you ladies come up
to our room and find out.

387
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,612
- We have a room?
- Yes.

388
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,114
We have the Shangri-La Suite,

389
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:07,034
because I told you
tonight is going to be a celebration.

390
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,794
- Mommy, look.
- It's beautiful.

391
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,380
- Can we stop, Mommy? Please?
- Okay. Yes.

392
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,132
But just for a minute, okay?

393
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,468
Oh!

394
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,221
Wow.

395
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,413
Billie.

396
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,002
Is this your boyfriend?

397
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:06,343
No. No, this is my old friend, Brad.

398
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:12,474
This is Ellary and this is Hudson.

399
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,060
I remember.

400
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,727
Yeah.

401
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,647
How you going, little man?

402
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,900
Up top. Right there. Oh, that's nice.

403
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,153
Hey, they're cool kicks.
Wish I had a pair.

404
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,198
- Maybe I can borrow yours, huh?
- Your feet are too big.

405
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,658
[Brad] What? These?

406
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:32,786
I guess you're right.

407
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,748
And who's this little one?

408
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,834
This is my son.

409
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,460
Hendricks.

410
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,296
Wow, Hendricks.

411
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,422
[Brad] Yeah.

412
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,760
[Billie] Look at you. You did it.

413
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,305
You're a dad.

414
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,389
Yeah.

415
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,102
It's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

416
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,646
But whatever happened to the...?

417
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,234
Well, the last time
we spoke things were...

418
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,611
- Complicated?
- Yeah.

419
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,779
Yeah.

420
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,657
I did lose the company.

421
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,951
Oh, my God, Brad.

422
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:16,663
It turns out it doesn't even matter.

423
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,916
It's being a father. This...

424
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,628
This is what I was born to do.

425
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,174
And I'll get back to it at some point.

426
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,801
Start all over again
with new artists. So...

427
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,219
It's all good.

428
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,893
And what about Gigi?
Is she okay with everything?

429
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,647
She loves her son.

430
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:45,984
[Majid] Billie.

431
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,694
Hi, babe.

432
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,322
Brad.

433
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,576
Congrats.

434
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,077
Thanks, mate.

435
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:03,168
Uh, Majid, this is Hudson.
This is Hudson and this is Ellary.

436
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,129
- So great to finally meet you guys.
- [Billie] Yeah.

437
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,590
Oh, come on, you know how
to shake hands. Come on.

438
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,593
- Hey.
- I should get out of here.

439
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,676
Why?

440
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,476
- It was great running in to you, Billie.
- Yeah. You too.

441
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,064
What a day.

442
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,607
[Majid] Hey, it's not over yet.

443
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,690
Yeah.

444
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,402
Today is ours.

445
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,961
[pop music playing over speaker]

446
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,379
[cheering]

447
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,631
[Piper] Give me those pants, hot shot.

448
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,800
- [Devon] Want them?
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

449
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,972
[laughing]
Cute little panties there, Tarzan.

450
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,891
- That's hot.
- Yeah. Yeah, I like my junk secured.

451
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,231
What can I get you?

452
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,732
I'll take a Jack and Coke.

453
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,194
Feels a bit like
a Jack and Coke kind of night?

454
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:20,537
You know what?
Let's just skip the Jack, huh?

455
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,622
And go straight to the coke.

456
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:31,506
Whoa. I bet you can't get
all that in a oner.

457
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,174
I got this.

458
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,761
[snorting]

459
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,181
[clears throat] Oof!

460
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,351
- Yeah.
- [hip-hop music playing over speaker]

461
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,894
I love this song.

462
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,938
[all laughing]

463
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,578
[shouting]

464
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,540
I am a golden god!

465
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:10,337
Yo, Machine Gun Connelly, your shot.

466
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,635
- [Cooper] Fuck.
- [all laughing]

467
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,180
Dude, you're supposed to walk
around the furniture.

468
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,808
Well, who put the fucking chair there,
huh?

469
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,185
Huh?

470
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,519
Fuck this chair.

471
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:30,273
- Hey, fuck this chair! Fuck this chair!
- Fuck this chair!

472
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:35,737
[all chanting] <i>Fuck this chair!
Fuck this chair! Fuck this chair!</i>

473
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,825
[glass breaking]

474
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,702
[car alarm blaring]

475
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,125
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

476
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,544
Just take the shot. Just take the shot.

477
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,462
Come on.

478
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,714
Ladies, ladies! Bras.

479
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,925
[knocking on door]

480
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,223
- [in high-pitched voice] Who is it?
- [laughing]

481
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,810
That looks hard.

482
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:10,397
No. I'll show you how.
You can do this. Just, uh, knee first.

483
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,857
Hold it above your knee and buck,
kick your knee up.

484
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,319
Try again, try again, try again.

485
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,529
You got it.

486
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,740
Okay, do it one more time, one more time.

487
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,368
I hate this game!

488
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,954
Your mom said you love soccer.

489
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:38,508
Um, okay. You know, when I was little,
every time I tried to kick a ball,

490
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,301
I fell on my butt,

491
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:45,765
but I kept trying because the only way
you get better at something

492
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,143
is through perseverance.

493
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,519
You can't give up so easy.

494
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,771
You said "butt."

495
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:58,611
Yes, yeah, I said "butt,"
because when I was little,

496
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,196
I fell on my tiny butt,

497
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,949
and if I fall now,
I fall on my big, big butt.

498
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,576
Oh, my God, you have a butt.

499
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,495
He has a butt! Everyone has a butt!
There's butts everywhere.

500
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:11,291
There's so many butts!
Butts, butts, butts!

501
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:12,374
[shouts]

502
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,878
You know what's a better word than butt?

503
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:18,631
Chocolate!
Does little miss cutie like chocolate too?

504
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,092
She certainly does.

505
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,971
Hey, what do you say
we go to my restaurant

506
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,932
and order one of everything
on the dessert menu.

507
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,893
You ever heard of a Nutella lava melt?

508
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,479
- I love Nutella.
- High five. Unh!

509
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,315
Okay. Let's go. Leave your car.

510
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,484
It's a few blocks.
It's a nice day. Let's walk.

511
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,567
Okay.

512
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,869
Let's walk.

513
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,537
Here we go!

514
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:57,253
It's been a crazy ride
these last few months.

515
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,796
I'm sure.

516
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,300
With the foundation, the vibrator.

517
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,053
I saw the billboard.

518
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:06,845
Can't miss it.

519
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,099
And the crossword.

520
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:12,684
Right?

521
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:20,485
Still it hasn't been everything
I thought it would be.

522
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,363
Because something's missing.

523
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:26,950
You.

524
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,621
It's been like
standing on Kilimanjaro all alone.

525
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,832
Until today.

526
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:38,628
You walked in
and I felt this jolt of electricity

527
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,796
through my whole body.

528
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:44,425
I felt that too, but these last few months
have been really hard, Sash.

529
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,179
I've been dreading running into you.

530
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:53,768
Because that's how this town is.
I just knew if I saw your face...

531
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,274
I'd be done for.

532
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,552
What are you doing?

533
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,054
I don't know.

534
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,560
All I do know is that I love you.

535
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,396
I want to be with you.

536
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,316
I don't know how to make that happen,

537
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,903
but you are what I want.

538
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,577
Okay. All right.
Look, how about 10 Benjamins

539
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,579
and my wife's ticket
to <i>Jagged Little Pill?</i>

540
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,372
You know you want to go with me.

541
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,266
[Bianca] I guess it's time to head home.

542
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,394
I'm gonna miss the two of you
all night long.

543
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,478
No.

544
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,483
I don't wanna go home.
It's the last place I wanna go.

545
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,235
Sorry, hot shot, but our fun is done.

546
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,530
Unless, of course, you wanna
put some more money in the meter.

547
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,577
Yes. Okay, I hired them.

548
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,497
But, dude, it was only to guarantee
a great fucking time

549
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,707
and a great time fucking.

550
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,917
[laughing]

551
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:45,046
And you really thought
that two hours was gonna do it?

552
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,756
Oh!

553
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,133
Really?

554
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:53,012
Ladies, how much
for the rest of the night?

555
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,390
Five grand.

556
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,266
Each.

557
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,897
You take Apple Pay?

558
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,650
Apple Pay, Zelle, Venmo,

559
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,111
and PayPal for you old guys.

560
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,530
- Shit, this is fucking awesome, bro.
- [laughing]

561
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,619
Wow. Cool car.

562
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,830
Yeah, that's insane.

563
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,874
But... where do we sit?

564
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,004
- Oh, shit.
- You're right. Yeah.

565
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,214
Piper and I could sit on your lap...

566
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,882
or maybe call an Uber.

567
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:34,012
No, I got a better idea.

568
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:02,206
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

569
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,584
- We need to talk. We need to talk.
- No.

570
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:11,424
Look, there are a million things
that don't make sense right now,

571
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,301
but please,

572
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,304
let's just have this one moment.

573
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,556
You and me.

574
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:21,975
Together.

I brought it for you.

589
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:42,223
Clearly you have never been around kids
on a sugar high.

590
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:46,060
Come on, it's a special day.
A little chocolate never hurt anyone.

591
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,646
Can Majid come to my soccer game tomorrow?

592
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:56,487
Um... Well, it's not up to me.
I mean, it's up to Majid.

593
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,865
I would be honored.

00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,241

00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,621
Uh, okay, you two, enjoy.

596
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:09,542
I just need a minute
to talk to your mom. Okay?

597
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:12,420
Okay. Whoa, Maj,
I can't leave my kids all alone

598
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,131
in a busy restaurant
in the middle of New York City.

599
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,132
Don't worry.

600
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:19,844
Hey, Barb, can you sit
with my little friends for a sec?

601
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,012
Happy to, boss.

602
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,308
I just need a minute.

603
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,733
Oh. [laughing]

604
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,069

Mm. Maj, what are you doing?

608
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,788
I just want you so much.

609
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,041
Okay, yeah. Well, I want you too,

610
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,793
but I really do
have to get back to the kids.

611
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,049
Yeah. You're right. I'm sorry.

612
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,510
But...

613
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,555
I know...

614
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:10,937
one way that you could be
at Hudson's game tomorrow.

615
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:16,108
Come stay with us in Connecticut tonight.

616
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:19,945
You sure?

617
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,450
This feels good.

618
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,036
We feel good.

619
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,706
I mean, I never thought
this is how today would end, but...

620
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,085
Maybe we are the new dream.

621
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:40,216
Sometimes your worst day can be your best.

622
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:53,896
Trust me, it's a lot cheaper than a wife
and a hell of a lot more fun.

623
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,358
Delivery service, baby,
that's some white glove shit right there.

624
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,818
Hey, you're welcome.

625
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,861
Thanks for coming out.

626
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,113
My pleasure.

627
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,448
Don't worry, this will make you happy.

628
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:10,288
Hey, let's get out of here.

629
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,622
Where did you have in mind?

630
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,041
Wherever these 'vettes
can stretch their legs a bit.

631
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,918
Let's see what these babies can do.

632
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:19,297
How about some place
I can show you what I can do?

633
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,424
[Devon] How about we hot tub it up?

634
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,175
Trina took the kids to her parents'.

635
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,593
So I got the house to myself.

636
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,429
Beep, boop, bap, boop.

637
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,015
Spa module activated.

638
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:33,394
I don't want to go to Greenwich.
We're in a New York state of mind.

639
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:38,357
We're going backcountry, bro.
See what these babies can do.

640
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,072
That was amazing.

641
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:50,244
That has never been our problem.

642
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:58,002
Look, I know we need to talk.
What did you want to tell me before?

643
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,173
Well...

644
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,010
these past few months...

645
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,138
a lot's been happening for me too.

646
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,143
First Do No Harm is expanding to Asia.

647
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,147
Setting up an operation center
in Singapore.

648
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,817
It'll double the number
of people we can serve.

649
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:22,985
So...

650
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,490
So, what are you trying to say?

651
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:29,992
I leave in a month.

652
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,787
Oh, my God.

653
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,539
I knew I needed to get out of New York

654
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:39,460
if I had any chance of getting over you.

655
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,464
I figured I'd never run into you
on Kay Poh Road.

656
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,759
So I drove you out of town?

657
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:51,222
Well, you are a big part of the reason
why I came back in the first place.

658
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,600
At least the hope of you.

659
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,190
I know.

660
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,612
We're right back where we were
all those years ago.

661
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,993
But I would never
be able to live with myself

662
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,540
if I didn't at least ask.

663
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,712
- Come with me.
- [chuckles]

664
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,672
Kam.

665
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,552
I don't know.

666
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,721
There's no right or wrong answer.

667
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,224
Whatever you decide.

668
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,561
You'll always be my dream.

669
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,446
[doorbell rings]

670
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,074
[Billie] Hi, hold on.

671
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,954
Ellary's still awake?

672
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,790
This is what happens
when you jack little people up on sugar.

673
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,256
[Ellary crying]

674
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:11,427
I know, I know. Okay.

675
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,304
Wow, this house is beautiful.

676
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,263
Yeah.

677
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,266
- A little bigger than your New York place.
- Oh.

678
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,853
Oh. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

679
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:24,190
Ah. Welcome to my other life.

680
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,192
I gave Olga the night off, so...

681
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,736
Okay, there's wine in the fridge.

682
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,489
I'm gonna put Ellary to bed
and I will be back in 10.

683
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,449
I'm good, don't stress.

684
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,176
It's so weird to be back here.

685
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,179
What do you mean back?

686
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,056
I grew up in Connecticut.

687
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:00,518
My parents still live here.
Married for 35 years.

688
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,810
Living the dream.

689
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:06,315
No, fuck that dream. This is the dream.

690
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:16,825
Sorry. It took forever to get Ellary down.

691
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,870
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

692
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,174
Long day.

693
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,222
Yeah. Yeah.

694
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,768
I should, uh...

695
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,436
I should probably take a shower.

696
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,730
Maybe...

697
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,360
you could come with me?

698
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,114
Do you want to come upstairs?

699
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,449
Are you sure?

700
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,119
It is why I asked you here.

701
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:08,836
Whoo!

702
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,421
This is crazy.

703
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,924
It's an Algonquin word. Did you know that?

704
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,885
- What did you say?
- Connecticut.

705
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:20,472
The Native Americans
were here long before us, so...

706
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,141
[Cooper] <i>That's an Algonquin word.</i>

707
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,517
Connecticut:

708
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,312
