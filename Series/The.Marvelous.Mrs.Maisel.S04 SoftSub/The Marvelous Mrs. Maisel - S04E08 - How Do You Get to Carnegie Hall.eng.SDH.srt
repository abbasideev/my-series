up all the other managers.

1029
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:23,710
Moishe is out of the woods.

1030
00:40:23,794 --> 00:40:24,877
-FRANK: Hey.
-Who?

1031
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:26,712
My ex-father-in-law. He is awake.

1032
00:40:26,796 --> 00:40:28,714
Hey, show some enthusiasm.

1033
00:40:28,798 --> 00:40:30,299
Why? It's your ex-father-in-law.

1034
00:40:30,383 --> 00:40:32,009
I don't give a shit about
your first-grade teacher,

1035
00:40:32,093 --> 00:40:33,260
your pediatrician or the first guy

1036
00:40:33,344 --> 00:40:35,262
who felt you up, either, by the way.

1037
00:40:35,346 --> 00:40:37,598
Susie! Hey, I got a weird one.

1038
00:40:37,682 --> 00:40:40,434
Yeah, that is not a sentence
you just yell out in public, Maggie.

1039
00:40:40,518 --> 00:40:41,769
Just for future reference.

1040
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:44,021
Some guy says he works for
Tony Bennett, and he wants

1041
00:40:44,105 --> 00:40:45,898
to talk to you about
booking one of your clients.

1042
00:40:45,982 --> 00:40:47,858
SUSIE: Really? Tony Bennett?

1043
00:40:47,942 --> 00:40:49,443
Well, send it on over.

1044
00:40:49,527 --> 00:40:51,612
Tony Bennett. You hear that?

1045
00:40:51,696 --> 00:40:54,323
-Tony Bennett's calling me.
-Well, his guy is.

1046
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:56,742
Well, his guy is, but
his guy is calling me

1047
00:40:56,826 --> 00:40:59,287
-because Tony Bennett told him to, so…
-Susie.

1048
00:41:01,038 --> 00:41:03,207
-Hold on, Maggie.
-MAGGIE: Okay.

1049
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:05,209
I was having a great
day for a minute there.

1050

Lenny put my name in
to open for Tony Bennett

1051
00:41:07,253 --> 00:41:08,796
at the Copa this week.

1052
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,172
The Copa?

1053
00:41:10,256 --> 00:41:11,590
The sold-out run at the Copa?

1054
00:41:11,674 --> 00:41:13,759
This… this sold-out run at the Copa?

1055
00:41:13,843 --> 00:41:15,052
That's the one.

1056
00:41:15,136 --> 00:41:17,638
Yeah, with the big
full-page ad that says,

1057
00:41:17,722 --> 00:41:19,807
"Hello, boys.
This show's a really big deal,

1058
00:41:19,891 --> 00:41:21,642
"and anyone associated with this ad"

1059
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:23,769
is gonna be rich and
famous and very, very happy."

1060
00:41:23,853 --> 00:41:24,812
Bingo.

1061
00:41:24,896 --> 00:41:27,106
BOTH: No opening acts.

1062
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,316
Yep. Hang up the phone, Maggie.

1063
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,068
-Why?
-I moved.

1064
00:41:31,152 --> 00:41:32,486
-Where to?
-I'm dead.

1065
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:35,072
-You are?
-Just hang up the goddamn phone.

1066
00:41:35,156 --> 00:41:36,615
Okay.

1067
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:38,325
Sorry.

1068
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:39,952
No problem.

1069
00:41:40,036 --> 00:41:41,494
You want some coffee?

1070
00:41:41,578 --> 00:41:43,121
Uh, sure.

-Susie, don't.
-Don't what?

Okay, no cream.

1081
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:04,142
this whole building used
to be somewhere else?

1082
00:42:04,226 --> 00:42:05,643
I'm gonna go with no.

00:42:05,727 --> 00:42:07,854
-The building has not been moved.
-You know, Midge,

1084
00:42:07,938 --> 00:42:09,689
that Bennett gig seems
like a big opportunity.

1085
00:42:09,773 --> 00:42:11,691
You might want to
give it a second thought.

1086
00:42:11,775 --> 00:42:13,276
Thanks, Frank. Susie and I have a plan.

1087
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,694
Is the plan to open for Tony Bennett?

1088
00:42:14,778 --> 00:42:15,820
'Cause that sounds like a good plan.

Tony Bennett is a great singer.

1091

-Yes, please.

Don't open the door.

Can I talk to you a minute?

-Who?
-Martini and Rossi.

I don't know. They're just hanging out.

1108
00:42:59,488 --> 00:43:01,323
Here. They are hanging out here.

1109
00:43:01,407 --> 00:43:03,325
Yes, here.
They got this place for me, remember?

1110
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:05,744
They found the furniture for me.
They suggested the layout.

1111
00:43:05,828 --> 00:43:07,621
-Why?
-Why?

1112
00:43:07,705 --> 00:43:09,623
'Cause it's not obvious
to the eye, Miriam.

1113
00:43:09,707 --> 00:43:11,166
It's a lot of fucking space to fill.

1114
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,460
Susie, think.
Why did they do all this for you?

1115
00:43:13,544 --> 00:43:15,045
'Cause you're just so fun to be around?

1116
00:43:15,129 --> 00:43:16,338
Fuck you. I am fun.

1117
00:43:16,422 --> 00:43:18,590
These guys aren't pals
with people without a catch.

1118
00:43:18,674 --> 00:43:20,092
What's the catch?

1119
00:43:21,135 --> 00:43:22,177
What do you care?

1120
00:43:24,555 --> 00:43:25,931
They said something about a taste.

1121
00:43:26,015 --> 00:43:28,183
-A taste of what?
-Okay, you need to relax.

1122
00:43:28,267 --> 00:43:29,476
These guys are mobsters.

1123
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,478
Hey, I know what they are, okay?

1124
00:43:31,562 --> 00:43:33,730
They kidnapped me for
a night, if you remember.

1125
00:43:33,814 --> 00:43:35,899
What are they getting a taste of?

1126
00:43:35,983 --> 00:43:37,901
Look, they did a favor for me.

1127
00:43:37,985 --> 00:43:40,362
Someday, I will do a favor for them.
That's how it works.

1128
00:43:40,446 --> 00:43:43,615
What favor? You have nothing
to give guys who want a favor.

1129
00:43:43,699 --> 00:43:45,784
-I have, too.
-I am the favor.

1130
00:43:45,868 --> 00:43:47,369
Okay. We are done here.

1131
00:43:47,453 --> 00:43:48,954

Now, I will admit that the
timing does seem suspicious,

1167
00:45:06,406 --> 00:45:10,576
but I need to make it very
clear that I did not have the thing

1168
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,733
because you told me
about your girlfriend.

I am surprised that she's pregnant,
