1194
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:26,314
You know, "Rose" is fine.

1195
00:44:26,398 --> 00:44:28,274
Rose Weissman has not
answered my question.

1196
00:44:28,358 --> 00:44:30,443
And she also hasn't passed the mustard.

1197
00:44:30,527 --> 00:44:33,571
Well, I'm relatively new to the game.
A few months.

-Beginner's luck.
-Uh-huh.

1201
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:39,702
Have you ever seen a
dog try to eat the kibble

1202
00:44:39,786 --> 00:44:41,329
out of another dog's dish, Rose Weissman?

1203
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:43,289
-Thankfully, no.
-It's ugly.

1204
00:44:43,373 --> 00:44:45,708
-Very ugly.
-A dog has one dish.

1205
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:47,585
He shouldn't have to
share his kibble with anyone.

1206
00:44:47,669 --> 00:44:49,754
Ladies, I think there's
been a misunderstanding.

1207
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:51,589
So you're not working as a matchmaker?

1208
00:44:51,673 --> 00:44:53,007
Well, yes, I am.

1209
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:54,759
But I assure you I'm not trying to eat

1210
00:44:54,843 --> 00:44:56,552
the kibble out of anyone's dish.

1211
00:44:56,636 --> 00:44:58,471

-Melamid's my territory.
-I don't understand.

1213
00:45:01,141 --> 00:45:03,351
Manhattan is divided up into territories.

1214
00:45:03,435 --> 00:45:05,353
It's the only way to keep
the peace after the wars.

1215
00:45:05,437 --> 00:45:06,437
The wars?

1216
00:45:06,521 --> 00:45:09,023
You don't want to know about the wars.

1217

Lost a lot of good ladies in the wars.

1218
00:45:11,151 --> 00:45:15,321
However, once everyone got
their piece, the wars stopped.

1219
00:45:15,405 --> 00:45:17,198
Now we each have our territory.

1220
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:19,075

1221

Washington Heights.

00:45:21,995 --> 00:45:23,788
West End, Midtown, Hell's Kitchen.

00:45:23,872 --> 00:45:25,915
Jews are everywhere,
but I stick to the Jews,

1224
00:45:25,999 --> 00:45:27,625
and Melamid's a Jew.

1225
00:45:27,709 --> 00:45:30,753
Well, I'm sorry.
I didn't know about the territories.

1226
00:45:30,837 --> 00:45:33,089
-You got our letter, didn't you?
-What letter?

The letter that you ignored.

1228
00:45:34,257 --> 00:45:35,758

Oh, that letter.

Yes, I did get it.

I just didn't understand it.

1232
00:45:41,556 --> 00:45:42,932
You didn't understand "stop"?

00:45:43,016 --> 00:45:44,767
-It's one word.
-What are you, an idiot?

00:45:44,851 --> 00:45:46,352
No. I understand it now.

New York is such a big city.

Surely, there's enough
business to go around.

been listening to us.

You are competition that
we do not need or want.

Now, we are ladies, and as ladies,

1244
00:46:04,496 --> 00:46:06,205
we wanted to give you a chance.

If you had pulled this
stunt out in Staten Island,

1246
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,792
all that would've been
left of you is that hat.

1251

Mr. Melamid would not approve.

00:46:23,765 --> 00:46:25,975
None of your other clients would, either.

1255
00:46:26,059 --> 00:46:28,978
What my daughter does has
nothing to do with my business.

Matchmaking isn't a business.
