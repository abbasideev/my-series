If I'd have known, I
would've said that the kid

190

had been abducted or something.

191
00:07:04,498 --> 00:07:06,042
I promise to tell you next time.

192

And what do we need a code for?

193
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,754
All you have to do is call and
say, "I picked another loser,

come the fuck down and save me."

195
00:07:11,381 --> 00:07:13,257
We need the code in case
he walks by and hears me.

196
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:14,884
I don't want to hurt his feelings.

197
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,844
Well, all I know is this
is the third crappy date

198
00:07:16,928 --> 00:07:18,054
you've been on this month.

199
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,139
You gotta kiss some frogs.

200
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,766
You can't date civilians.

201
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,726
-Well, who am I going to date?
-Someone in the business.

202
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,478
I am not gonna date a comic.

203
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:28,314
A comic? God, no. You fuck
that frog before you date a comic.

204
00:07:28,398 --> 00:07:31,442
-Then who?
-I don't know.

205
00:07:31,526 --> 00:07:32,735
How about a ventriloquist?

206
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,445
Why the hell would I
date a ventriloquist?

You've got kids.
Seems like a slam dunk to me.

You've gotta be kidding.

210
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:39,575
At least he's bound
to have a personality.

211
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,743
Two, actually.

212
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,578
-A ventriloquist?
-Yes.

A man who sits with a
wooden version of a tiny man

214
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:45,039
on his lap and tries to make it talk.

215
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:46,207
That's who you want me to date?

216
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,291
When I look at you, I see ventriloquist.

217

-Hey, Susie…
-What, Miriam?

218
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:56,853

relationship that you had?

220
00:07:57,428 --> 00:08:00,471
We always talk about me and
my relationships. What about you?

221

I haven't seen you with anybody

222
00:08:01,723 --> 00:08:03,642
-since we've been together.
-So?

223
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:06,520
-Just curious about your life.
-My life is you. That's it.

224
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:08,939
Thinking about you. Talking about you.

225
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:11,650
Waiting for you, rescuing
you from bullshit dates.

226
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:13,318
-I don't have time for anything else.
-Yeah, but…

227
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:15,112
As soon as I get you off my fucking hands

228
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:17,531
and make you a star, I can
shove you out on an iceberg

229
00:08:17,615 --> 00:08:19,116
and focus on something else.

230
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,410
Fine.

What?

232
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,250
Maybe I've been hanging
out with you for too long,

233
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:30,634

you wore the wrong hat.

just pee-pee and go back to bed.

251

And Susie is blasting that damn TV again.

260
00:09:42,284 --> 00:09:43,576
She's been having trouble sleeping.

261
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,411
The TV helps her relax.

262
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:47,163
Has she tried sleeping pills?

263
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:50,333
Your mother has a gallon
jug of them in the closet.

264
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:52,210
She says they make
her loopy the next day.

Who says my pills make me loopy?

267
00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:58,717
I was just saying to Miriam

268
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:01,762
that Susie has stayed
here longer than expected.

269
00:10:01,846 --> 00:10:04,890
Her friend dying in her
apartment really threw her.

I'm sorry, but when my close
friend Mordecai Glickman

00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:10,354
died playing squash,

272
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:13,607
I was back on the squash
court at 6:00 the next morning.

273
00:10:13,691 --> 00:10:15,484
I forgot that it was to play Mordecai,

274
00:10:15,568 --> 00:10:17,444
so it was all for naught,
but you get my point.

275
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:19,780
Her time here does seem endless.

276
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:22,032
And I told Asher he could bunk here.

277
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:25,077
Should I steer him to
some godforsaken motel?

278
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:28,080
There's room for Asher.
It'll be tight, but we'll get by.

Zelda, it's so late. Why are you here?

281
00:10:32,877 --> 00:10:35,087
Miss Susie is using a plate and a glass,

282
00:10:35,171 --> 00:10:37,381
so I stayed late so I can wash them.

283
00:10:37,465 --> 00:10:38,924
Zelda, I'll wash Susie's
plates when she's done.

284

-But that's my job, Miss Miriam.
-It doesn't matter.

288
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:51,228

-I can turn it down.
-You don't need to turn it down.

-Excuse me, Abe?
-Yeah.

There's a guy here.

298
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:20,967
He's been sitting in the
hallway for half an hour.

299
00:11:21,051 --> 00:11:23,428
We finally asked, and he
said he was a friend of yours.

00:11:23,512 --> 00:11:25,430
-Of mine?
-Then he said, "Check that.

I could see you were busy typing…
it looked important.

Maybe you were
tattling on a sick relative

the best in the business, too.

-You want to

walk around the Village a bit?
Get some souvenirs?

You don't have bowls? Don't you eat soup?

329
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:35,334
I don't trust soup.
It tells you it's food,

330

00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:03,238
Because you look very
nice in your blue suit.

345
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:05,407
-Thank you, but…
<i>-Well, it was nice catching up.</i>

346
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:08,076
Remember, wear your blue
suit Friday night. I love you.

347
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,079
-And your room is here when you want it.
<i>-Ma?</i>

348
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:12,414
-Wait, Ma.

349
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:14,249
So, when this soup tells you it's food,

350
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,085
does it speak or spell it out
in little alphabet letters or…

351
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:19,588
I think it's time for you
to meet my parents.

352
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:22,257
-Did you hear me?
-Nope.

353
00:13:22,341 --> 00:13:23,675
I put them off for as long as I could,

354
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,510
-but we are out of time.
-Nope.

355
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:27,554
-We have no choice.
-Nope.

356
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:29,264
-Mei.
-Are you insane?

357
00:13:29,348 --> 00:13:31,933
-I know it'll be awkward.
-It'll be a disaster!

358
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:34,144
Joel. I mean…

359
00:13:34,228 --> 00:13:35,687
They won't care that you're short.

360
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:38,273
But they will care that I
look like their dry cleaner.

361
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:40,525
You're in luck.
My mother does not use a dry cleaner.

362
00:13:40,609 --> 00:13:43,112
Are you aware of all the
colorfully descriptive words

363
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:44,733
that'll come to their
minds when they see me?

364
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:44,989
No.

365
00:13:45,073 --> 00:13:46,532
-You want me to rattle them off?
-No, thanks.

366
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:48,117
I'll just write them down.

367
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:49,952
I've heard these terms my entire life,

368
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:51,829
so the list will be comprehensive.

369
00:13:51,913 --> 00:13:52,872
This is not helping.

370
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:54,290
Mei.

371
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:55,917
-Mei.
-Hold on.

372
00:13:57,418 --> 00:13:59,462
Okay. You made your point.

373
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:00,963
You think I'm an idiot?

374
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:02,882
I know that there's a
lot of ugly shit out there

375
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:05,134
that people…
Oh, now, that one, you made up.

376
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:06,552
That was my nickname in kindergarten.

377
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:08,554
Look, I know my parents.

378
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:11,015
You being Chinese…
yes, it will be a surprise.

379
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:13,476
But trust me, it will not
be their biggest problem.

380
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,019
-No?
-You not being Jewish,

381
00:14:15,103 --> 00:14:16,145
that's gonna wake the neighbors.

382
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:18,189
Right.
They don't want you with a gentile.

383
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,316
And a Chinese girl is
like a double gentile.

384
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,151
Triple gentile. More.

385
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:24,487
Basically, you're walking in
with the Lawrence Welk singers.

386
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:27,198
Well, what's the alternative, huh?
We're together.

387
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:29,492
They have to find out. Your parents know.

388
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,202
Yes, they do.

389
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:33,621
Would you like to know all
the colorfully descriptive words

390
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:35,164
that came to their minds
when they found out?

391
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:36,874
I'll just write 'em down.

392
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,627

Do you understand what's happening here?

394
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,006
My mother's sending
girls to my workplace.

395
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,508
One's coming Friday,

396
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,343
and I have no proof
she's not sending the rabbi.

397
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,637
Well, he's not much of a
rabbi if he's working on Friday.

398
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,222
She won't stop till I'm married.

399
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,348
I'm okay with being a mistress.

400
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,891

-You were with Midge.

-Sorry.
-What the fuck?

403
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,522
I know. I'm sorry. I am. But…

404
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,942
I can't.

00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,903

-Mei.

-Get this, get this.
-Yeah, this is fucking great.

414
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,509
Come on, all you told me is
you cut some guy's balls off.

415
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,553
Right, right. We cut them off.

416
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,555
But we stuffed them
into the other guy's mouth.

417
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,056
And the other guy's balls

418
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,393
-got stuffed into the first guy's mouth.
-Yeah.

419
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,228
Yeah, when you cut off a guy's balls,

420
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:38,938
you're supposed to
stuff them in the mouth

421
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,815
of the guy the fucking balls belong to.

422
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,526
So we were like, "What do we do?
Switch them back?"

423
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,112
How do you do that?
I mean, rigor mortis was setting in.

424
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,530
Their jaws were clenching tight.

425
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,282
Yeah, yeah.
So, we were weighing our options.

426
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:52,076
Then we heard sirens,
so we decided to split.

427
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,244
I know you make half this shit up,

428
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:54,245
but it's still fucking great.

429
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,664
Yeah, we really don't make things up.

00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,416

-but sounds like a douche.
-I don't want to talk about it.

436

Well, he's Giancana's
anyway, so we can't touch him.
