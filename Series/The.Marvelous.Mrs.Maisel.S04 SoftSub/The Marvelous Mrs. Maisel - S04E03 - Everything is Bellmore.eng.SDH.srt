Back in high school…

1076
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:32,594
Mepham High in Bellmore,
out on Long Island…

1077
00:42:32,678 --> 00:42:34,179
I took this speech class.

1078
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:36,139
One day, the teacher stands me up

1079
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:38,141
in front of everybody
and gives me a topic.

1080
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:40,435
Zoos. Are they good or bad?
Some shit like that.

1081
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:42,020
I was supposed to be against them.

1082
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:45,148
Told me to take five full
minutes to make my case. Now,

1083
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:47,442
I'm feeling fairly
confident about the subject,

1084
00:42:47,526 --> 00:42:48,985
so I start my little spiel,

1085
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:51,446
going on about how
animals shouldn't be in cages

1086
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,614
and how we're the real animals

1087
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:53,990
for putting them
there in the first place…

1088
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:55,283
-Mm-hmm.
-…when all of a sudden,

1089
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:57,577
I get beaned in the head by an eraser.

1090
00:42:57,661 --> 00:43:01,039
I check to see who threw it,
and it was the fucking teacher.

1091
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:02,874
Now, I'm surprised, to say the least,

1092
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:05,460
but I continue my little
speech with a masterful segue

1093
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:08,213
into the science of evolution
and how we're no less animal

1094
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:09,589
than any other of God's creatures

1095
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:11,424
that is, if God exists; I threw that in

1096
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:14,761
when another fucking eraser
hits me in the fucking head.

1097
00:43:14,845 --> 00:43:16,596
And it's like that every ten seconds

1098
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,889
for the rest of my speech.

1099

1101
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:24,229
But I soldier on and get
through the five minutes.

1102
00:43:24,313 --> 00:43:27,357
Afterwards, I ask my teacher,
"What was that all about?"

1103
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:29,359
And she says, "Mr. Schneider."

1104
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:31,069
For I was Schneider at the time.

1105
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:33,488
"Mr. Schneider, I was simply training you

1106
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:34,614
"to block out distractions."

at you, and you did good."

1110
00:43:40,704 --> 00:43:43,206
but it turned out to be
a very valuable lesson.

1111
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,208
