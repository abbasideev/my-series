00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,711
<i>I just moved along with it.</i>

352
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:04,298
<i>Blend in… that was the strategy.</i>

353
00:12:05,341 --> 00:12:06,425
<i>When I got to the front,</i>

354
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:08,594
<i>everyone was kneeling.</i>

355
00:12:08,678 --> 00:12:11,055
<i>So I knelt, too.</i>

356
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,141
<i>That's when I saw him.</i>

357
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:16,560
<i>He was holding this silver cup.</i>

358
00:12:16,644 --> 00:12:19,730
<i>And in order not to look suspicious…</i>

359
00:12:19,814 --> 00:12:23,025
-Abe, you didn't.
-I took Communion.

360
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,860
-Oh, my God.
-I think the priest

361
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,028
was suspicious.

362
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,364
Especially when he
said, "the body of Christ"

363
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:29,865
and I answered, "mazel tov."

364
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:30,866
My head is spinning.

365
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,867
So, there I was,

366
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,369
with a mouthful of Christ,

367
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,329
wondering what the hell to do.

368
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:37,915
I left immediately and took it out.

369
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:42,378
And now… what do I do with it?

370
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,213
Wrap it up in something. Set it aside.

371
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,507
-We've got bigger worries.
-They mentioned Miriam

372
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:48,634
and the grandchildren by name.

373
00:12:48,718 --> 00:12:51,554
Go clean up. We will figure this out.

374
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:59,521
I really appreciate you coming
to this showcase yourself

375
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:01,356
and not just sending an associate.

376
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,525
You won't be sorry. Alfie's the best.

377
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:04,609
-[KNOCKING]
-Don't come in!

378
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:06,236
I said don't come in.

379
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,529
Midge Maisel is here.

380
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:09,072
[QUIETLY] Now? She's early.

381
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:11,783
Uh, so I'll see you
Friday night, Mr. Glatter.

382
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:13,535
Thank you. Tell Midge to wait.

383
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:14,536
I'm here.

384
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,537
I need her to wait!

385
00:13:15,621 --> 00:13:17,080
-Could you step outside?
-Really?

386
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,124
She's already in. Let her stay.

387
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,543
-[CRYING]
-Why is she crying?

388
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:22,961
Why are you here?

389
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:24,546
-We had an appointment.
-At 1:00.

390
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,382
No, at 11:00, and it's
noon, so I'm an hour late.

391
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:29,843
DINAH: I told her 11:00 so
she'd be here at noon! You said,

392
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:31,928
"That fucking Miriam, she's
always an hour fucking late

393
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,847
because she doesn't give a
shit about anyone but herself!"

394
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:36,141
Thank you! And I didn't say that!

395
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:37,976
Well, you're here. Sit.

396
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,812
Because I actually have a happy
piece of news to share with you.

397
00:13:40,896 --> 00:13:42,564
Happy news. I'm all ears.

398
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:43,982
Took a lot of string-pulling,

399
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:45,859
but you said you wanted a headlining gig.

400
00:13:45,943 --> 00:13:47,444
I got you a headlining gig.

401
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:48,445
Are you kidding?

402
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:49,696
Thousand-seat theater.

403
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,822
Good pay, too.

404
00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:52,157
Amazing. Where's the gig?

405
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:53,408
Croatia.

406
00:13:53,492 --> 00:13:54,993
Where is that, Pennsylvania?

407
00:13:55,077 --> 00:13:57,412
The Republic of Croatia.
That's where the gig is.

408
00:13:57,496 --> 00:13:59,664
The name of the place
is in their language,

409
00:13:59,748 --> 00:14:03,835
which loosely translates as
"Make Laugh Showing Teeth."

410
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:04,836
Croatia?

411
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,546
Uh, specifically Zagreb.

412
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,672
I think that's the capital.

413
00:14:07,756 --> 00:14:09,841
-DINAH: It is!
-Thank you!

414
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:11,468
It's a five-night stand,

415
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:13,887
but the place only turns on
its electricity one night a week.

416
00:14:13,971 --> 00:14:15,472
So you would fly in for that one night,

417
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:17,557
do the gig, then fly back.
Then you wait six days

418
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:19,559
and you fly back into
Zagreb, do another gig,

419
00:14:19,643 --> 00:14:21,311
-and then fly back.
-For five straight weeks?

420
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:22,896
Now, you're gonna need shots.

421
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,856
Uh, smallpox, tetanus, diphtheria.

422
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,858
Apparently it's excruciatingly painful,

423
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:28,485
so you want to get 'em
about a week before you go.

424
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:30,695
Susie, I can't do all that
traveling back and forth

425
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,739
to a far-off country for one show a week.

426
00:14:32,823 --> 00:14:33,907
I'll drop dead.

427
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:34,991
No, not if you get your shots.

428
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,077
Pass.

429
00:14:38,704 --> 00:14:40,330
You said, "Make me a headliner."

430
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:41,915
In the Western Hemisphere.

431
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:44,209
-So it's a no.
-It's a million noes.

432
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:46,336
So you'll warm up for Sophie
Lennon, but you won't take this?

433
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,588
That was a mistake
that I won't make again.

434
00:14:48,672 --> 00:14:50,340
You know, I don't think
I can do better than this.

435
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:52,342
Do you understand?
I mean, just last week,

436
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:54,344
I had a pretty big guy
angling to check you out.

437
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,012
I didn't even have a place
to send him to see you.

438
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,013
Who?

439
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,348
You ever heard of Gordon Ford?

440
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,350
Really? Gordon Ford would come see me?

441
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:01,518
Yes. Well, no, not him.

442
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:03,061
He's too big. But his booker.

443
00:15:03,145 --> 00:15:05,522
His booker?
Well, that's still pretty big, his booker.

444
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:07,774
…'s intern. His booker's intern.

445
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:10,068
But he was really into it.
And he reports to the booker,

446
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:11,778
and the booker reports to Gordon Ford.

447
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:13,488
Fine. If they really want to see
me, they can always come over…

448
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:15,031
Before you finish that goddamn sentence,

449
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:18,368
these guys cannot come to
an illegal strip club to see you.

450
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:19,911
They're too legit.
They can't be seen there,

451
00:15:19,995 --> 00:15:21,329
so they just won't do it.

452
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:24,082
And there is no local
headlining gig for you.

453
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,625
Not in the near future.

454
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:28,044
I am working on it,
but let's be realistic.

455
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,629
-I'm going to lunch.
-Good.

456
00:15:29,713 --> 00:15:31,173
Go. Take a handkerchief.

457
00:15:32,507 --> 00:15:33,925
-What's the matter with her?
-[SIGHS]

458
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:37,095
Long story. Just don't make
friends, 'cause she's got to go.

459
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:38,263
Oh. Poor thing.

460
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:40,390
She's not professional, you know?

461
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:41,808
She's got these boyfriends
she's always fighting with,

462
00:15:41,892 --> 00:15:44,227
and her tiny family's
always running around.

463
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:47,063
Too much drama, too much trouble.
A lot of snot.

464
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:48,982
Well, I was gonna get the
Alfie showcase info from her.

465
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:50,358
I'm bringing four with me.

466
00:15:50,442 --> 00:15:51,693
Just grab a flyer.
It's underneath that pile.

467
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:53,945
-Which one?
-The one on the right.

468
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:55,780
Not that one. Next to it.

469
00:15:55,864 --> 00:15:57,115
The other next to it.

470
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,075
You glued to your seat or something?
Show me.

471
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,745
-It's right there.
-Why aren't you standing?

472
00:16:03,038 --> 00:16:04,122
Susie?

473
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:06,291
I'm not wearing pants.

474
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,792
Really?

475
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:09,586
No, I just thought I'd do
some light comedy for you.

476
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,837
Yes, really.

477
00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:12,547
Well, so what?
I've seen you in your boxers.

478
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:16,134
Um… I'm not wearing boxers.

479
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:19,262
-You're just… naked down there?
-Yes.

480
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:20,597
Don't you stick to the seat?

481
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:22,098
It wasn't a choice.

482
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,975
The phone rang, Dinah wasn't in yet,

483
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:25,310
and I wasn't done dressing.

484
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:27,812
-But…
-Get all your questions out now!

485
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:30,607
You dress yourself completely
on the top, then do the bottom?

486
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:31,733
-[PHONE RINGING]
-Yes.

487
00:16:31,817 --> 00:16:33,569
And not, like, start with underwear

488
00:16:33,653 --> 00:16:35,613
on top and bottom and
then move on to outerwear?

489
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:38,282
-No.
-Susie Myerson and Associates.

490
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:39,700
May I ask who's calling?

491
00:16:39,784 --> 00:16:40,993
Who is it, Nicky?

492
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:44,872
It's Sandy Bishop, at
McCormick-Hatlestad.

493
00:16:44,956 --> 00:16:45,873
Oh, hi, Midge.

494
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:47,708
I have to take this.

495
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:50,002
Submit the rest of your
questions in writing, okay?

496
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:51,879
-I'll talk to you later.
-Close the door

497
00:16:51,963 --> 00:16:52,838
on your way out.

498
00:16:52,922 --> 00:16:54,882
Hey! Miriam!

499
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:57,176
-Mr. Bishop, hello.
-Midge. Long time no see.

500
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,178
Hi, Frank. You guys helping out?

501
00:16:59,262 --> 00:17:01,055
-Whenever we can.
-Yeah, we hooked her up

502
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,640
-with this place, you know.
-I know.

503
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:04,475
And she's very happy here.

504
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,352
So, uh, you taking the Croatia gig?

505
00:17:06,436 --> 00:17:07,603
At Make Laugh Showing Teeth.

506
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:09,063
-Uh, no.
-NICKY: Really?

507
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:11,607
-It's a thousand-seater. Headliner.
-With electricity.

508
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:13,067
I can't take it for many reasons,

509
00:17:13,151 --> 00:17:15,027
but, for one, I can't
leave the kids that long.

510
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:17,488
Ah. So it's a family thing.

511
00:17:17,572 --> 00:17:18,489
Mainly.

512
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:22,910
Okay. "Not taking due to family."

513
00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:24,078
You keeping track?

514
00:17:24,162 --> 00:17:26,664
Well, you're part of
our family now, right?

515
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:30,209
Oh. Sure. I mean, my immediate
family's growing by the second,

516
00:17:30,293 --> 00:17:31,919
-so why not?
-Miriam,

517
00:17:32,003 --> 00:17:36,632
unless I'm mistaken, are you expecting?

518
00:17:36,716 --> 00:17:38,509
You're glowin' but you're not showin'.

519
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:41,804
No.
My husband and his mysterious girlfriend

520
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:43,389
are expecting, and [INHALES]

521
00:17:43,473 --> 00:17:44,807
