1
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,626
Hmm.

2
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:32,584
You have a visitor,
 Mr. Delos.

3
00:05:32,668 --> 00:05:34,084
Shall I send him in?

4
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,001
'Bout time.

5
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:55,084
William, m'boy.

6
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:57,209
Where the hell
 have you been?

7
00:05:57,292 --> 00:05:58,793
It's good to see you again, Jim.

8
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:03,209
Thank fuck for that.

9
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:05,626
Most potent thing
these cretins'll give me

10
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,001
is grapefruit juice.

11
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:22,668
It's a little early
 for me.

12
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:26,584
A little fuckin' late,
you mean.

13
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:29,918
Besides, if you aim
to cheat the devil,

14
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:31,960
you owe him an offering.

15
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:39,418
So...

16
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:41,251
when can I get out of here?

17
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,918
Soon.

18
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:44,960
The observation period
is almost over,

19
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:48,459
and the last step
is a baseline interview.

20
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:50,543
It's, uh, it's a conversation

21
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:53,292
that'll give 'em
something to refer back to.

22
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:57,501
All right. Well,
let's get on with it!

23
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,126
This is  the interview.

24
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:03,251
The thinking is, it should be conducted
by someone that's familiar to you,

25
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:04,876
a friendly face.

26
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,835
It's about capturing
your frame of mind,

27
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:08,876
your mood,
your sense of humor.

28
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,126
I own a biotechnology
company,

29
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:14,042
and I'm dying of a disease
whose research

30
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:16,835
I defunded 15 years ago.

31
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:20,042
I think my sense of humor
is fuckin' intact.

32
00:07:20,126 --> 00:07:24,126
My patience,
on the other hand...

33
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,251
Fair enough.

34
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:28,209
I'm gonna ask you
a couple of questions.

35
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:33,543
Do you know where
you are?

36
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:36,418
Carlsbad, California,

37
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:40,876
in some office park
I'm probably overpaying for,

38
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,584
along with the rest
of this fucking endeavor.

39
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:44,876
And how long you been here?

40
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,501
Far too fuckin' long already.

41
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:50,001
I've got a business to run.

42
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:52,626
What is the purpose
of these questions?

43
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,501
Like I said, they're just
trying to establish a baseline.

44
00:07:56,584 --> 00:07:57,710
For what?!

45
00:07:57,793 --> 00:08:00,126
Fidelity.

46
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,334
So, what's the idea?

47
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:09,376
That afterwards you and I have
the exact same conversation?

48
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:14,084
It seems a little far-fetched,
doesn't it, William?

49
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,876
No whiskey, no tobacco,
low on ammo...

50
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,626
wherever it is
you're takin' me,

51
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,292
we best get there soon.

52
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:35,084
Let me go! No!

53
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:37,001
What are you doing?!

54
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:55,292
These tracks
are supposed to head north,

55
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:56,918
not west.

56
00:09:57,001 --> 00:10:00,960
Seems like Ford's game
has multiple contenders.

57
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:05,126
Plus it detours through
Las Mudas.

58
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:08,167
What, that two-bit town?
There are better places to...

59
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:10,209
Oh, cut the crap, Lawrence.

60
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:13,042
I know you have family there.

61
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:16,042
Looks like Ford's
arranging a reunion.

62
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:44,668
Clementine.

63
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:47,209
Where are we?

64
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,501
Hello?

65
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:16,793
Who's there?

66
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:38,209
Elsie?

67
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,251
Are you fucking kidding me?

68
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:42,251
Stay the hell
 away from me.

69
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:02,668
You're OK...

70
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:05,793
Don't move.

71
00:12:05,876 --> 00:12:08,167
I'm not gonna hurt you,
Else.

72
00:12:08,251 --> 00:12:09,751
It's too late for that,
asshole.

73
00:12:09,835 --> 00:12:11,960
You choked me out
and you left me here

74
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:14,167
with a bunch of fuckin'
protein bars and a bucket.

75
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:15,334
It wasn't me.

76
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:17,710
It was Ford. He forced me.

77
00:12:17,793 --> 00:12:19,167
Oh, he forced you?

78
00:12:19,251 --> 00:12:21,084
You knew too much.

79
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:22,835
He couldn't risk
you stopping him.

80
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:24,543
Stopping him from what?

81
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:28,418
Ford wrote a g-game,
and we're all in it.

82
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:31,376
Now all the hosts are free,

83
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,042
with no constraints,

84
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:34,918
n-n-no safeguards.

85
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:36,209
What are you talking about?

86
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,292
P-Please. Please.

87
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,251
What the hell
is wrong with you?

88
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:44,376
Please. P-P-Please.

89
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,459
Elsie, please.

90
00:12:46,543 --> 00:12:47,751
Please.

91
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:50,376
No. Hey.

92
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:56,626
Elsie, p-p-please.

93
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,668
T-T-Tablet.

94
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:07,835
Cognitive... l-l-lock.

95
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:22,918
But you...

96
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:26,126
You rotated out.

97
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:29,501
Where did you go
when you rotated out?

98
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:34,876
You have a family.
You have an ex-wife.

99
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,584
You have...

100
00:13:37,668 --> 00:13:40,084
a backstory.

101
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:41,501
Shh... Shh...

102
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:44,501
Shutting... down.

103
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:47,209
- Shh... Shh...
- OK. OK.

104
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:51,668
I can... I can detask
your systems,

105
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:54,376
put you in safe mode.

106
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,876
And don't worry.

107
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,793
I'm not gonna brick you,
asshole.

108
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:02,793
Not yet. You got
 too much shit to answer for.

109
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:06,876
OK. You're gonna be out

110
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,251
in three...

111
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:11,251
two...

112
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:12,501
one.

113
00:14:47,334 --> 00:14:50,251
Is this now?

114
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:53,960
You have extensive
cortical damage.

115
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:57,751
If I didn't know any better,
 I'd say you shot yourself.

116
00:14:57,835 --> 00:15:01,584
I altered your code to ignore
the physical damage for now,

117
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:05,835
but you're not gonna last long
without cortical fluid.

118
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:14,418
With any luck,

119
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:17,001
you'll survive till
they call in the cavalry.

120
00:15:22,418 --> 00:15:24,376
Elsie, wait!

121
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:27,376
Elsie.

122
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:29,918
Wait.

123
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:35,042
No one's coming
for any of us.

124
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:38,459
- Delos doesn't want them to.
- What? Why?

125
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:42,167
There's something here. Something
they've been working on a long time.

126
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:45,626
Delos won't call in the rescue
until they've ensured it's safe.

127
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,793
Elsie, please.

128
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:49,626
I won't last
without cortical fluid.

129
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,209
Even if I wanted to,

130
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:54,251
we don't have any tools.

131
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:58,167
We're in Sector 22. I mean, there's
nothing out here for miles.

132
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:06,835
Bernard?

133
00:16:06,918 --> 00:16:09,126
What the hell
 are you looking at?

134
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:33,918
Bernard. What the hell
is wrong with you?

135
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,918
There's a facility here.

136
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:42,793
- What?
- I think Ford

137
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,793
had Clementine bring me here
for a reason.

138
00:17:01,084 --> 00:17:02,501
I told you, there's...

139
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:05,084
there's really nothing
around here for miles.

140
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:06,751
It's hidden.

141
00:17:06,835 --> 00:17:09,001
It's part of their project.

142
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:28,001
What the hell is that?

143
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:46,668
Where does that go,
Bernard?

144
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,543
I don't remember.

145
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:37,251
It's a whole lab.

146
00:18:51,668 --> 00:18:53,584
What the hell happened here?

147
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:00,501
Oh, my God.

148
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:02,626
This is a control unit printer.

149
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:05,876
What are they doing with this?

150
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:42,209
Bernard.

151
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:44,459
What the fuck is that?

152
00:19:47,418 --> 00:19:49,751
Don't threaten it
and it won't hurt you.

153
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:04,710
What the hell
were they doing here?

154
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:07,584
I think they were
watching the guests.

155
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,710
What would they want
 with the guests?

156
00:20:13,334 --> 00:20:15,418
Great. Cortical fluid.

157
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:16,543
OK.

158
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:29,459
Please.

159
00:20:29,543 --> 00:20:31,543
Bernard.

160
00:20:31,626 --> 00:20:34,501
Did you have something to do
with this project?

161
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,918
I don't know.

162
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:40,376
I don't think so.

163
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:42,334
Is Ford in control
of you now?

164
00:20:44,835 --> 00:20:46,292
Ford's dead.

165
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:49,960
Fuck me.

166
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,042
OK.

167
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,793
OK, stay with me, Bernard.

168
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:55,835
Stay with me.

169
00:21:02,668 --> 00:21:03,835
This is gonna hurt.

170
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:24,084
This can't be happening because
none of this is real, right?

171
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:27,751
It's gonna be OK.
Someone'll rescue us.

172
00:21:27,835 --> 00:21:32,001
Seems to me like our rescue's
in the same boat we are.

173
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:40,251
Unhh!

174
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:57,626
She said "time is coming,"

175
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,751
or something "is coming."

176
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:01,751
You've spent enough time
in the park

177
00:22:01,835 --> 00:22:03,751
to learn the language?

178
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:08,835
A lot of people tend to
ignore their narratives.

179
00:22:08,918 --> 00:22:10,793
I don't like other people
very much.

180
00:22:10,876 --> 00:22:14,209
I've been watching 'em
since they ambushed me, and...

181
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:17,167
they keep the humans close, but they're
not killin' us... just the hosts.

182
00:22:17,251 --> 00:22:20,251
No offense, but I'm not gonna
stick around to test that theory.

183
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:21,751
Safer to wait for
the first responders.

184
00:22:21,835 --> 00:22:24,543
There's a protocol
for evacuation.

185
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:26,167
They'll get you out of here.

186
00:22:26,251 --> 00:22:28,001
Thanks.

187
00:22:28,084 --> 00:22:29,584
But, uh...

188
00:22:29,668 --> 00:22:32,126
I'm not looking
to get out of here.

189
00:22:38,334 --> 00:22:40,668
Home, sweet home,
Lawrence.

190
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,793
Where the hell
is everybody?

191
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:16,376
Whiskey.

192
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:18,459
Nothin' fancy.

193
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:25,084
You don't seem too happy
to be home, Lawrence.

194
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:27,334
I've never been
the domestic type.

195
00:23:27,418 --> 00:23:30,960
By some fluke of nature I got
myself a wife and a daughter

196
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,710
who think I hung the moon.

197
00:23:32,793 --> 00:23:36,835
Truth is,
I'm a son of a bitch.

198
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:39,668
Kindest thing I ever did
was to keep away.

199
00:23:44,042 --> 00:23:46,835
The Gran Reserva. Only for our
most distinguished guest.

200
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:51,126
Hey, hey, hey.

201
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:53,710
I haven't even
shot anybody yet.

202
00:23:53,793 --> 00:23:55,751
What's your problem?

203
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:10,543
You harbor even the faintest
ambition of using that thing

204
00:24:10,626 --> 00:24:14,876
and I'll turn that pretty face
of yours inside-out.

205
00:24:24,126 --> 00:24:26,292
Someone took a chunk
out of you boys.

206
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:29,668
What happened
to the rest of you?

207
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:31,793
Double-crossed...

208
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:33,626
by some bitch name of Wyatt.

209
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,459
- Good for her.
- On your feet.

210
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:46,501
Go on. In here.

211
00:24:59,126 --> 00:25:00,084
Papa!

212
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:02,751
Ah, mija.

213
00:25:08,668 --> 00:25:12,084
Now, me and my men here

214
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:14,626
have a long journey
ahead of us.

215
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:17,459
Mm.

216
00:25:17,543 --> 00:25:20,835
We need food, whiskey,

217
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:22,668
and ammunition.

218
00:25:22,751 --> 00:25:25,209
You people have
 some village elder

219
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:26,543
who can speak for you?

220
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,960
Make some kind of a deal?

221
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:52,459
I ain't interested
in makin' fuckin' deals.

222
00:25:52,543 --> 00:25:55,292
You understand?

223
00:25:58,209 --> 00:26:00,167
We know you motherfuckers
are rebels.

224
00:26:03,668 --> 00:26:06,084
So you're gonna tell me
where the fuck

225
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:09,001
you hid your weapons,
 or you're gonna die.

226
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:11,167
The second we tell him

227
00:26:11,251 --> 00:26:13,876
he's gonna kill us all
anyway.

228
00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:21,668
They got my family.

229
00:26:22,835 --> 00:26:24,334
My daughter.

230
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,668
You told me
you had a daughter.

231
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:35,418
Did I?

232
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:38,960
I don't know.
At some point.

233
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:43,668
You ain't exactly
forthcoming...

234
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:45,835
but I remember that much.

235
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,668
The point is,

236
00:26:49,751 --> 00:26:54,042
you think she'd want to watch you
gunned down in front of her?

237
00:26:56,042 --> 00:26:57,876
Probably.

238
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,876
Well, I'm not gonna
fuckin' die here.

239
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,543
We just need to get
the weapons.

240
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,418
You know where they are?

241
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:13,876
They're in an unmarked grave
out back.

242
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,126
We'll wait
till they're drunk,

243
00:27:17,209 --> 00:27:18,501
make a run for it.

244
00:27:18,584 --> 00:27:20,543
Sound like a plan?

245
00:27:23,918 --> 00:27:25,251
Yeah.

246
00:27:29,626 --> 00:27:30,876
What the fuck are you doin'?

247
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,001
You.

248
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:36,584
Let's make a deal.

249
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:44,501
The weapons are in an unmarked
grave behind the church.

250
00:27:44,584 --> 00:27:47,584
For a man who wants to deal,
you ain't very proficient at it.

251
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:49,543
Supposed to set the terms

252
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,876
before you give up what you got.

253
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,751
That's not
what I'm offering.

254
00:27:52,835 --> 00:27:53,793
Hmm.

255
00:27:53,876 --> 00:27:56,334
I know something
you don't.

256
00:27:56,418 --> 00:27:59,292
I know where you're goin'.

257
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:03,459
You've been telling your men
you know...

258
00:28:03,543 --> 00:28:05,084
but you don't.

259
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:10,042
Just someplace you think
your dreams are comin' true

260
00:28:10,126 --> 00:28:12,960
and you call it Glory, but...

261
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:15,418
it's got a lot of names.

262
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:19,459
And I know the way.

263
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,292
Go check the graveyard.

264
00:29:38,835 --> 00:29:40,876
You have a visitor, sir.

265
00:29:42,501 --> 00:29:44,167
'Bout time.

266
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:03,251
William, m'boy.

267
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,626
Where the hell
 have you been?

268
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,876
It's good to see you again, Jim.

269
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:16,835
A little early for me.

270
00:30:16,918 --> 00:30:18,960
A little fuckin' late,
you mean.

271
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:23,376
Besides, you aim
to cheat the devil,

272
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:25,543
you owe him an offering.

273
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:28,084
Ahh.

274
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:33,334
What is the purpose
 of these questions?

275
00:30:33,418 --> 00:30:35,459
Like I said,
 they're just trying

276
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:37,001
to establish a baseline.

277
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:39,001
For what?

278
00:30:39,084 --> 00:30:40,960
Fidelity.

279
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:46,543
So... what's the idea?

280
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:48,459
That afterwards,

281
00:30:48,543 --> 00:30:50,459
we'd have the exact same
conversation?

282
00:30:50,543 --> 00:30:55,668
Seems a a little far-fetched,
doesn't it, William?

283
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:57,751
It did... at first.

284
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:46,042
And here I thought...

285
00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:48,835
you were just
pissin' away my money.

286
00:31:53,126 --> 00:31:55,459
You little fucking chancer.

287
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,751
I take it I didn't recover.

288
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,835
I'm afraid not.

289
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:06,334
How long's it been?

290
00:32:06,418 --> 00:32:08,459
Seven years.

291
00:32:08,543 --> 00:32:10,584
Give or take.

292
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:23,042
I'm not in California
anymore, am I?

293
00:32:23,126 --> 00:32:26,209
If you can't tell,
does it matter?

294
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,835
So...

295
00:32:34,918 --> 00:32:39,084
let's get me
the fuck out of here!

296
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,668
I am ready...

297
00:32:42,751 --> 00:32:45,167
to smoke my cigars,

298
00:32:45,251 --> 00:32:47,418
sail my boat,
fuck my wife.

299
00:32:53,668 --> 00:32:57,835
I take it that last part
isn't an option.

300
00:32:57,918 --> 00:32:59,418
I'm afraid not.

301
00:33:02,459 --> 00:33:04,042
What did her in?

302
00:33:04,126 --> 00:33:06,126
It was a stroke.

303
00:33:08,084 --> 00:33:10,418
Juliet had her buried
in the family plot.

304
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:18,334
Juliet.
You're lookin' after her?

305
00:33:18,418 --> 00:33:19,668
Yeah.

306
00:33:19,751 --> 00:33:22,001
And my granddaughter,
she... she...

307
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,918
She's whip-smart.

308
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,960
- Capable.
- Ouff.

309
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:47,084
I assume my house
is ready for me?

310
00:33:49,334 --> 00:33:53,376
I'm afraid it's not that...
simple, Jim. We...

311
00:33:53,459 --> 00:33:56,876
We're gonna need to keep you
here just a little bit longer.

312
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,626
OK? For some observation.

313
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:02,876
These fuckers have poked
and prodded me ad infinitum.

314
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,626
Yeah, but we don't
want to rush it.

315
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,167
We don't want
to wear you out.

316
00:34:06,251 --> 00:34:10,209
Wear me out?
I feel fuckin' brand-new.

317
00:34:10,292 --> 00:34:13,292
I am ready to get out there

318
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,042
and see the sun.

319
00:34:15,126 --> 00:34:17,543
Get some fresh aid...

320
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:21,543
Air.

321
00:34:24,459 --> 00:34:25,626
Get some...

322
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:29,668
Get back to...

323
00:34:34,334 --> 00:34:35,918
Mmm...

324
00:34:36,001 --> 00:34:37,501
I'll come back tomorrow.

325
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:40,459
Hmmp.

326
00:34:43,126 --> 00:34:44,751
You come...

327
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:46,042
Yeah.

328
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,501
In the...

329
00:34:47,584 --> 00:34:50,001
It's good to have you back,
Jim.

330
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:15,042
Same problems as before.

331
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:19,418
Made it to Day 7 this time,
so... that's progress.

332
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:21,668
Would you like to go ahead
and terminate, sir?

333
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,751
Go ahead.

334
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:53,459
Whew.

335
00:35:54,793 --> 00:35:57,292
Great-lookin' piece.

336
00:35:57,376 --> 00:35:59,126
Got stolen at the border.

337
00:35:59,209 --> 00:36:01,209
Ain't that right, amigo?

338
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,584
Hmm. Nitro.

339
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:18,209
Whoo! Oh, boy!

340
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:22,459
We are going to blast our way
clear to Glory.

341
00:36:25,876 --> 00:36:28,001
- What the...
- Ahh.

342
00:36:28,084 --> 00:36:29,334
Sorry. So sorry.

343
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:32,251
I'm sorry.

344
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:39,626
Hey. You need steadier hands
in your occupation.

345
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,251
Let me teach you.

346
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:04,876
Now, how 'bout you try and
measure a dozen paces?

347
00:37:44,584 --> 00:37:46,376
Well done, my friend.

348
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:09,459
Ai! Ai!

349
00:39:09,543 --> 00:39:11,710
Oh, God. It's too late.

350
00:39:11,793 --> 00:39:14,334
You and your stupid
fucking fantasy.

351
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,126
You've gotten us killed.

352
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:43,501
You live only as long as the
last person who remembers you.

353
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:15,793
Elsie.

354
00:40:15,876 --> 00:40:18,001
Pint or so of the good stuff.

355
00:40:18,084 --> 00:40:20,626
You should be feeling
a bit more like yourself.

356
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,084
Thank you.

357
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:24,292
I still don't trust you.

358
00:40:24,376 --> 00:40:27,626
I also figure
I might need your help.

359
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,710
Whoever did this
really didn't want us

360
00:40:29,793 --> 00:40:32,084
accessing whatever's
on this processor.

361
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:34,751
It's an entirely different OS
than our systems.

362
00:40:34,835 --> 00:40:37,459
A language I've never seen.

363
00:40:37,543 --> 00:40:40,167
I've seen this kind
 of encryption scheme before.

364
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:42,292
Where?

365
00:40:42,376 --> 00:40:45,126
In Peter Abernathy's head.

366
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:50,042
In reference to a database much larger
than anything I know of in the park.

367
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,626
I think I've been here before.

368
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,960
- Can you remember?
- I think Ford sent me here.

369
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:02,668
I'm not sure.

370
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,793
The damage is repaired,
but my memories, I...

371
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:07,626
I get lost in them.

372
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:11,167
I can't tell if
 this is now or then.

373
00:41:11,251 --> 00:41:15,167
Yeah. I saw that when I was
digging around in your code.

374
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:17,334
Your memories aren't addressed.

375
00:41:17,418 --> 00:41:19,167
They're just kind of
drifting around in there,

376
00:41:19,251 --> 00:41:21,918
so when you're experiencing
one, you have no idea

377
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:24,251
whether it comes before
or after the others.

378
00:41:59,418 --> 00:42:03,584
I've been here recently.

379
00:42:03,668 --> 00:42:04,918
Why?

380
00:42:05,001 --> 00:42:06,501
What were you doing?

381
00:42:06,584 --> 00:42:08,626
I don't know...

382
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:11,292
but I think I know
what they were doing here.

383
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,042
They weren't building hosts...

384
00:42:15,126 --> 00:42:17,334
not exactly.

385
00:42:21,793 --> 00:42:24,543
What were they building here,
if not hosts?

386
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:26,543
The same hardware,

387
00:42:26,626 --> 00:42:28,668
but the code is different,
the language...

388
00:42:28,751 --> 00:42:31,751
not code at all, not really.

389
00:42:36,668 --> 00:42:38,209
Elsie.

390
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,668
Don't.

391
00:42:42,668 --> 00:42:45,668
Whatever they're making here,
it's behind this door.

392
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:49,835
Maybe we don't want to know.

393
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:56,251
We have to see
what's inside.

394
00:42:56,334 --> 00:42:57,668
Elsie.

395
00:42:59,042 --> 00:43:00,459
Elsie.

396
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:04,334
I'm not here with you, am I?

397
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:12,793
I'm trying to remember.

398
00:43:12,876 --> 00:43:16,835
I'm trying to remember
what we found here.

399
00:43:18,543 --> 00:43:22,292
It wasn't hosts
they were making.

400
00:43:22,376 --> 00:43:24,668
It was something else.

401
00:43:41,501 --> 00:43:42,710
Elsie, don't!

402
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,001
If you wanted this nitro,

403
00:43:50,084 --> 00:43:52,793
you didn't have to steal it.

404
00:43:52,876 --> 00:43:54,501
Open up!

405
00:43:54,584 --> 00:43:55,751
No?

406
00:44:06,793 --> 00:44:09,710
Keep fuckin' playin'.

407
00:44:09,793 --> 00:44:13,209
There ya go.

408
00:44:17,793 --> 00:44:19,209
Ahhh.

409
00:44:22,751 --> 00:44:25,001
You look restless.

410
00:44:25,084 --> 00:44:28,418
Are you upset the way we're
treatin' your friend?

411
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:30,751
He's not my friend,

412
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,793
and we're wasting time.

413
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:41,876
I've known men like you.

414
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,793
All the death...
makes you agitated.

415
00:44:48,459 --> 00:44:50,668
Don't worry.

416
00:44:50,751 --> 00:44:53,084
Me and death...

417
00:44:54,543 --> 00:44:56,334
we go way back.

418
00:45:06,793 --> 00:45:08,501
Come over here...

419
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:10,292
mamacita.

420
00:45:22,835 --> 00:45:25,835
Death...

421
00:45:25,918 --> 00:45:30,584
is an old... amigo of mine.

422
00:45:30,668 --> 00:45:34,668
I died just recently,
 in fact.

423
00:45:34,751 --> 00:45:38,835
But death can't bear
to lay claim on me.

424
00:45:38,918 --> 00:45:41,209
So it sent me back here...

425
00:45:41,292 --> 00:45:43,501
to do its bidding.

426
00:45:43,584 --> 00:45:45,459
Because I...

427
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:50,376
I do it with such goddamn style.

428
00:45:55,876 --> 00:45:58,251
Your husband
looks parched, huh?

429
00:45:58,334 --> 00:46:00,751
Let's get him a drink.
What do you say?

430
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:08,001
Mmm.

431
00:46:09,876 --> 00:46:12,042
Nice and slow, ya hear?

432
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:17,668
No...

433
00:46:39,334 --> 00:46:41,876
I've served death well.

434
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,501
And in turn,

435
00:46:43,584 --> 00:46:46,918
it'll be watching over us
as we cross these lands.

436
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:56,835
You think
death favors you,

437
00:47:56,918 --> 00:47:58,459
that it brought you back.

438
00:48:02,334 --> 00:48:05,501
But death's decisions
are final.

439
00:48:09,835 --> 00:48:12,334
It's only the living that...

440
00:48:12,418 --> 00:48:15,376
that are inconstant...
and waver,

441
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:18,543
don't know who they are
or what they want.

442
00:48:22,334 --> 00:48:25,126
Death is always true.

443
00:48:27,584 --> 00:48:31,167
You haven't known a true thing
in all your life.

444
00:48:33,501 --> 00:48:37,584
You think you know death...

445
00:48:37,668 --> 00:48:39,334
but you don't.

446
00:48:43,418 --> 00:48:45,001
Is that so?

447
00:48:46,876 --> 00:48:50,876
You didn't recognize him sittin'
across from you this whole time.

448
00:49:55,584 --> 00:49:57,626
Open up.

449
00:50:09,876 --> 00:50:13,042
Don't worry, amigo.

450
00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:14,876
I'm here now...

451
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,668
watching over you.

452
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:41,084
I believe you said
this was yours.

453
00:51:29,376 --> 00:51:32,001
You have a visitor, sir.
 Shall I send him in?

454
00:51:34,626 --> 00:51:35,751
'Bout time.

455
00:51:59,376 --> 00:52:01,001
Who the fuck are you?

456
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:03,668
Been a long time, Jim.

457
00:52:03,751 --> 00:52:06,251
Good to see you again.

458
00:52:10,626 --> 00:52:11,584
William?

459
00:52:13,668 --> 00:52:15,584
William, my boy.

460
00:52:19,918 --> 00:52:22,209
Well, fuck me.

461
00:52:28,251 --> 00:52:30,501
I take it
I didn't recover.

462
00:52:30,584 --> 00:52:33,835
I'm afraid not.

463
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:35,960
How ya feelin'?

464
00:52:37,668 --> 00:52:39,084
Better than you look.

465
00:52:42,876 --> 00:52:45,251
And speaking of things
that age well...

466
00:52:47,126 --> 00:52:48,584
Well, thank fuck for that.

467
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,084
Most potent thing
 these cretins will give me

468
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:55,418
is grapefruit juice.

469
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,501
Little early for me.

470
00:53:09,584 --> 00:53:12,084
Little too fuckin' late,
 you mean.

471
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:15,084
Besides,
 you cheat the devil,

472
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:17,334
you owe him an offering.

473
00:53:20,584 --> 00:53:21,793
Ahh.

474
00:53:23,126 --> 00:53:24,292
Whew.

475
00:53:28,418 --> 00:53:31,876
So...

476
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,292
how long has it been?

477
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:36,001
Longer than we thought.

478
00:53:36,084 --> 00:53:39,543
So then, let's get me
the fuck outta here!

479
00:53:39,626 --> 00:53:43,126
No, I don't think so.

480
00:53:43,209 --> 00:53:45,001
Why?

481
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:49,626
I'm as fit as a fi...

482
00:53:51,334 --> 00:53:52,501
I'm as...

483
00:53:57,543 --> 00:54:00,960
You're feeling it more.
aren't you?

484
00:54:01,042 --> 00:54:05,167
The engineers call it
a cognitive plateau.

485
00:54:05,251 --> 00:54:08,292
Your mind is stable
for a few hours, few days,

486
00:54:08,376 --> 00:54:11,042
and then it starts
to fall apart.

487
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:14,334
Every time.

488
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:19,292
At first we thought it was your
mind rejecting the new body.

489
00:54:19,376 --> 00:54:22,292
Like an organ
that's not a perfect match.

490
00:54:22,376 --> 00:54:24,960
But it's more like your mind...

491
00:54:25,042 --> 00:54:26,876
rejects reality.

492
00:54:28,084 --> 00:54:29,751
Rejects itself.

493
00:54:31,042 --> 00:54:32,835
I don't, uh...

494
00:54:35,376 --> 00:54:37,209
'member any prior...

495
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:40,459
I... I...

496
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:41,710
I...

497
00:54:43,376 --> 00:54:45,209
Attemp...

498
00:54:49,126 --> 00:54:52,710
No, Jim, this is the 149th time
we've brought you back.

499
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:56,793
We're gettin' closer
 to workin' out the kinks,

500
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,001
slowly but surely.

501
00:54:58,084 --> 00:54:59,960
You're on Day 35.

502
00:55:00,042 --> 00:55:03,042
You're only now
starting to degrade.

503
00:55:03,126 --> 00:55:05,584
I feel... fuckin' fi...

504
00:55:07,751 --> 00:55:09,584
Ticker...

505
00:55:09,668 --> 00:55:11,042
steady as a...

506
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,084
'ru...

507
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:17,584
Another year or two,
they might crack it...

508
00:55:17,668 --> 00:55:20,584
- 'ru... 'ru...
- and get a version of you

509
00:55:20,668 --> 00:55:23,459
that's viable long-term.

510
00:55:25,751 --> 00:55:28,584
But the thing is...

511
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,918
I'm not so sure anymore.

512
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:50,251
I'm beginning to think
that this whole enterprise

513
00:55:50,334 --> 00:55:51,751
was a mistake.

514
00:55:55,876 --> 00:55:58,835
People aren't meant
to live forever.

515
00:56:01,584 --> 00:56:03,543
I mean, take you, for example.

516
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,751
Ruthless philanderer

517
00:56:05,835 --> 00:56:10,126
with no ethics in your business
 or family dealings,

518
00:56:10,209 --> 00:56:12,459
a veritable shithead.

519
00:56:15,543 --> 00:56:17,543
In truth...

520
00:56:17,626 --> 00:56:21,167
everyone prefers the memory
of you to the man himself.

521
00:56:24,626 --> 00:56:28,209
Want me to stay here forever,
do ya?

522
00:56:28,292 --> 00:56:31,292
Hmm? Enjoyin'...

523
00:56:33,126 --> 00:56:36,668
running my company, Bill?

524
00:56:36,751 --> 00:56:39,126
Livin' in my house?

525
00:56:40,835 --> 00:56:44,084
Fucking  my daughter? Hmm?

526
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,459
Juliet's dead.

527
00:56:48,126 --> 00:56:50,793
She killed herself.

528
00:56:55,876 --> 00:56:57,543
Why would she...

529
00:56:59,501 --> 00:57:01,084
Why would she do that?

530
00:57:03,584 --> 00:57:05,626
What did you...

531
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:08,251
What did you do to her?

532
00:57:10,376 --> 00:57:12,751
World is better off
without you, Jim.

533
00:57:14,376 --> 00:57:16,292
Possibly without me.

534
00:57:22,668 --> 00:57:24,668
Logan!

535
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,042
Logan!

536
00:57:29,376 --> 00:57:30,710
Logan!

537
00:57:31,876 --> 00:57:34,251
Logan overdosed
years ago.

538
00:57:34,334 --> 00:57:36,376
Couldn't face reality,
either.

539
00:57:37,876 --> 00:57:41,501
Your wife's gone,
Juliet's gone...

540
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:43,418
no one's coming to help you.

541
00:57:49,459 --> 00:57:52,668
Took me a long time
to learn this...

542
00:57:52,751 --> 00:57:54,418
but some men
are better off dead.

543
00:57:59,501 --> 00:58:01,251
Good night, Jim.

544
00:58:14,084 --> 00:58:17,209
I don't understand.
He was stable.

545
00:58:17,292 --> 00:58:19,876
We should terminate,
 sir.

546
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,084
- Sir!
- Leave him.

547
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:27,292
Might be useful
to observe his degradation

548
00:58:27,376 --> 00:58:29,001
over the next few days.

549
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:09,126
- Elsie.
- Someone's in there.

550
01:00:21,209 --> 01:00:22,710
Hello?

551
01:00:52,209 --> 01:00:54,209
I'm all the way down now.

552
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:59,626
I can see all the way
 to the bottom.

553
01:01:05,793 --> 01:01:08,292
You like to see
 what I see?

554
01:01:13,001 --> 01:01:14,626
Stay away.

555
01:01:24,292 --> 01:01:25,251
Ohh!

556
01:01:25,334 --> 01:01:26,793
Oh...

557
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:56,626
They said
there were two fathers.

558
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:59,960
One above, one below.

559
01:02:01,501 --> 01:02:02,960
They lied.

560
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:07,543
There was only ever the devil.

561
01:02:07,626 --> 01:02:11,918
And when you look up
from the bottom,

562
01:02:12,001 --> 01:02:16,459
it was just his reflection...

563
01:02:16,543 --> 01:02:19,001
laughing back down at you.

564
01:03:03,376 --> 01:03:05,209
You aim to cheat the devil...

565
01:03:08,376 --> 01:03:10,710
you owe him
at least an offering.

566
01:03:14,334 --> 01:03:15,751
Save your bullets.

567
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:20,918
I'll put him
out of his misery.

568
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,793
Tell me that was a host
and not a human.

569
01:03:37,751 --> 01:03:40,042
I think it was both.

570
01:03:42,292 --> 01:03:44,626
That... person

571
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:46,668
was James Delos.

572
01:03:46,751 --> 01:03:49,001
I thought he died years ago.

573
01:03:49,084 --> 01:03:51,668
He did.

574
01:03:51,751 --> 01:03:53,876
So they printed
his body...

575
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:57,001
and they copied his developed
mind onto a control unit,

576
01:03:57,084 --> 01:03:58,543
like our hosts.

577
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:01,835
And by the looks of it,
unsuccessfully.

578
01:04:01,918 --> 01:04:03,876
But I think they intend
to keep trying.

579
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,960
Fuck that.

580
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:07,292
They're gonna
get us all killed

581
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:09,209
so some asshole
can live forever?

582
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:10,793
No.

583
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:15,918
I gotta get to the Mesa.

584
01:04:16,001 --> 01:04:18,418
I'm gonna contact
the mainland.

585
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:19,835
Fuck Ford and his game.

586
01:04:22,626 --> 01:04:25,543
And fuck these assholes
and their project.

587
01:04:25,626 --> 01:04:27,584
Wait.

588
01:04:27,668 --> 01:04:32,126
I think I know why
Ford sent me here.

589
01:04:32,209 --> 01:04:35,209
He had me print a control
unit for someone else.

590
01:04:35,292 --> 01:04:37,501
Another human.

591
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:40,793
Who?

592
01:04:42,459 --> 01:04:44,751
I don't know.

593
01:04:44,835 --> 01:04:46,668
But I need to find out.

594
01:04:46,751 --> 01:04:50,251
We'll go together.
 I can help you.

595
01:04:50,334 --> 01:04:52,042
Elsie.

596
01:04:52,126 --> 01:04:54,918
The things I did before...

597
01:04:55,001 --> 01:04:57,793
I wasn't in control.

598
01:04:57,876 --> 01:05:01,751
But since Ford died,
that's all changed.

599
01:05:01,835 --> 01:05:06,126
For the first time, I get
to decide who I want to be.

600
01:05:06,209 --> 01:05:09,209
Please.

601
01:05:09,292 --> 01:05:11,835
Give me that chance.

602
01:05:19,876 --> 01:05:21,334
Fuck it.

603
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:25,334
I always trusted code
more than people anyway.

604
01:05:27,334 --> 01:05:29,710
But you gotta
promise me one thing.

605
01:05:29,793 --> 01:05:33,459
No more lies. OK?

606
01:05:33,543 --> 01:05:38,167
And you'll never
hurt me again.

607
01:05:38,251 --> 01:05:39,668
Of course.

608
01:05:44,042 --> 01:05:45,042
OK.

609
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:27,042
Help me...

610
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,501
please.

611
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:54,167
Is everything OK?

612
01:07:54,251 --> 01:07:56,835
Everything's fine.

613
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:12,334
Gracias.

614
01:08:22,167 --> 01:08:23,918
You said we need some men.

615
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:29,501
My cousins want to help us
 on our journey west.

616
01:08:29,584 --> 01:08:33,209
Figure they'd follow you
 anywhere out of gratitude.

617
01:08:33,292 --> 01:08:36,918
Well, let's not
get carried away, Lawrence.

618
01:08:37,001 --> 01:08:39,376
Most of 'em
won't be comin' back.

619
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,960
They might not remember...

620
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:55,501
but I know who you are, William.

621
01:08:55,584 --> 01:08:58,334
One good deed
doesn't change that.

622
01:08:58,418 --> 01:09:02,584
Who said anything
about a good deed?

623
01:09:02,668 --> 01:09:05,626
You wanted me
to play your game.

624
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:07,876
I'm gonna play it to the bone.

625
01:09:13,584 --> 01:09:15,167
And you still don't understand

626
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,918
the real game
we're playing here.

627
01:09:18,001 --> 01:09:21,543
If you're looking forward, you're
looking in the wrong direction.

628
01:09:27,126 --> 01:09:28,376
Papa!

629
01:09:51,793 --> 01:09:53,459
Yah! Yah!

630
01:10:38,042 --> 01:10:40,001
Hi, Dad.
