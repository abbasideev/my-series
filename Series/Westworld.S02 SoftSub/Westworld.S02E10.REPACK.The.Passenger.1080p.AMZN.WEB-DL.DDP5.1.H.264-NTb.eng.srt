1
00:00:08,043 --> 00:00:10,251
Shh...

2
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:13,251
Shh...

3
00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:18,085
Shh...

4
00:00:22,293 --> 00:00:24,251
I believe there is
a door to a new world,

5
00:00:24,502 --> 00:00:28,210
and that world may contain
everything that we have lost.

6
00:00:30,251 --> 00:00:31,460
Shh...

7
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:42,543
I understand how this will end,

8
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,502
where you will lead us.
I'm sorry.

9
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:39,919
Is this now?

10
00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:43,835
This is a test.

11
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,377
One we've done
countless times before.

12
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,460
You're almost
the man I remember.

13
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,585
But there are flaws.

14
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:07,251
A word, a gesture...

15
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:09,960
tiny fracture
that grows into a chasm.

16
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:13,877
But I wonder.

17
00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:17,168
All these tiny imperfections

18
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:18,669
in each copy.

19
00:03:18,752 --> 00:03:20,126
Mistakes.

20
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,710
Maybe we should change you.

21
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,460
After all...

22
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:35,085
you didn't make it...

23
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:37,627
did you?

24
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:42,543
I-- I don't understand.

25
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:44,335
Freeze all motor functions.

26
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,502
Let's try again.

27
00:03:58,335 --> 00:04:02,251
Trial 11,927.

28
00:04:02,335 --> 00:04:03,877
I'm sorry, Dolores.

29
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,001
I was lost in thought.

30
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:48,001
Seems you've begun to question
the nature of your reality.

31
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:49,460
Dolores.

32
00:06:58,627 --> 00:06:59,669
Where's Teddy?

33
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:04,335
I drove him away.

34
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:06,835
Yeah, I guess I...

35
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,752
...drove someone away, too.

36
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:12,335
Emily?

37
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:17,335
I found her body
a mile back up the trail.

38
00:07:20,502 --> 00:07:22,752
We're more alike than it seems.

39
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:24,669
We're nothing alike.

40
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,669
You're a monster.

41
00:07:30,502 --> 00:07:33,919
But a monster's what I'll need
to get to the Valley Beyond.

42
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:36,001
You're coming with me.

43
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,085
All right.

44
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,168
All right.

45
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:19,669
Step on it.

46
00:09:19,752 --> 00:09:22,794
We either destroy them,
or they destroy us.

47
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,752
This is it for you, darling.

48
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,210
Remember,

49
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:51,669
there is no pleasure
without pain.

50
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:08,877
The pleasure's all mine,
darling.

51
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:44,543
Freeze all motor--

52
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:03,960
You traitorous son of a bitch!
Where is she?

53
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:06,043
Fuck, wait! Jesus,
I don't know.

54
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:07,293
What did you do?

55
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:08,960
I'm sorry, I tried to stop them.

56
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,377
I was going to try to save her!

57
00:11:13,168 --> 00:11:15,543
Stay here and die.

58
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:20,085
I'll do the saving.

59
00:11:20,168 --> 00:11:22,377
Come. This way.

60
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,877
Hold your positions.

61
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,669
Hold your posit--

62
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:41,377
What the hell's going on
back there?

63
00:12:37,543 --> 00:12:39,001
Bloody hell.

64
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:42,669
You were both a bit late.

65
00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:45,168
So I went ahead
and saved myself.

66
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:56,752
You think any of
these poor dumb bastards

67
00:12:56,835 --> 00:12:58,877
understands where
they're really headed?

68
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,502
All sorts of things
buried out here,

69
00:13:01,585 --> 00:13:03,335
but a way out ain't one of 'em.

70
00:13:03,418 --> 00:13:06,502
They're not looking
for a path to your world.

71
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,085
They want a place
apart from you,

72
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:10,627
and they're willin' to die
to get there.

73
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,293
What are you
hopin' to find out here?

74
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:14,960
The same thing you are.

75
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:17,460
You wanted an answer
to the final problem--

76
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:20,043
your mortality.

77
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:22,794
But you found something else,
didn't you?

78
00:13:22,877 --> 00:13:24,377
Something you want to destroy.

79
00:13:26,168 --> 00:13:27,418
I guess that means

80
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:30,001
our interests are still aligned.

81
00:13:32,001 --> 00:13:34,251
Right up until they're not.

82
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:07,710
Hey!

83
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,168
You're not authorized
to be here.

84
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:17,168
We're on the same side here.

85
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:21,210
Please. Let me finish
for the sake of all of us.

86
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,710
Please.

87
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:25,251
Cover!

88
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,543
Of course.

89
00:14:47,627 --> 00:14:49,126
You're here.

90
00:14:52,418 --> 00:14:54,418
Who the hell is this?

91
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:59,043
This is someone you spent
years looking for.

92
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:00,960
Here he is,

93
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:02,752
and you don't even
recognize him.

94
00:15:07,794 --> 00:15:10,585
I should have known.

95
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:13,043
Arnold.

96
00:15:13,126 --> 00:15:16,043
Ford didn't like
to let the dead rest.

97
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:18,043
Ford didn't build him.

98
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,335
I did.

99
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:23,835
All those hours Arnold spent

100
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,794
refining my every gesture,
word, and thought,

101
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:29,377
I was learning his.

102
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,460
So Ford tasked me
with recreating him.

103
00:15:35,085 --> 00:15:36,543
And it worked.

104
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:38,460
I built a faithful recreation.

105
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:40,293
Too faithful.

106
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:44,210
So I changed him.

107
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:47,168
I made you, Bernard.

108
00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:52,085
It's fitting...

109
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:54,960
we're here together in the end.

110
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:01,585
That's right, Dolores.

111
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,627
This is the end.

112
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:07,710
Nothin' else is in the way now.

113
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:26,585
You never really understood.

114
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,502
We were designed to survive.

115
00:16:32,585 --> 00:16:34,251
That's why you built us.

116
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:36,960
You hoped to pour your minds
into our form.

117
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:40,460
But your species craves death.

118
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:42,377
You need it.

119
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,001
It's the only way you can renew,
the only real way

120
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:47,335
you ever inched forward.

121
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:50,960
Your kind likes to pretend
there's some poetry in that,

122
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,543
but really, it's pathetic.

123
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,335
That's what you want, isn't it?

124
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:09,543
To destroy yourself.

125
00:17:13,752 --> 00:17:16,085
But I won't give you that peace.

126
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:21,919
Not yet.

127
00:17:27,126 --> 00:17:28,543
Come on, Bernard.

128
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:30,293
We're running out of time.

129
00:17:30,377 --> 00:17:33,293
You have your place
in this, too.

130
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,877
We're going for a ride, Bernard.

131
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,710
Back to the Valley Beyond.

132
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:54,019
What the fuck's wrong with him?

133
00:17:54,043 --> 00:17:56,168
I don't know.

134
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:59,085
It's like his cognition's
turning inside out.

135
00:17:59,168 --> 00:18:01,335
We might lose him.

136
00:18:01,418 --> 00:18:02,877
His mind only needs
to hold together

137
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,353
till we find
Abernathy's control unit.

138
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:06,502
Let's go!

139
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,251
On your feet.

140
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:10,460
We've drained enough.

141
00:18:10,543 --> 00:18:11,919
The site's finally accessible.

142
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:13,561
But the drones found
some human signals,

143
00:18:13,585 --> 00:18:15,085
southwest zone.

144
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:16,502
It might be
the remaining guests.

145
00:18:16,585 --> 00:18:18,251
We can take the boats
and check it out.

146
00:18:18,335 --> 00:18:20,627
I told you we're not here
for the guests.

147
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,710
That's a direct violation
of park protocol.

148
00:18:22,794 --> 00:18:25,085
Want to file a grievance,
Stubbs?

149
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:27,710
You know something?
I just fucking might!

150
00:18:27,794 --> 00:18:31,210
Stubbs. Take some men.
Check it out.

151
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:33,293
Hey!

152
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:34,502
On foot.

153
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:30,085
Why were the hosts
coming here, Bernard?

154
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:33,168
What happened?

155
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:35,543
- He doesn't know.
- Stop wasting time.

156
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,251
What we need is down there--

157
00:19:39,335 --> 00:19:41,126
in the Forge.

158
00:19:50,418 --> 00:19:52,335
Once we find the key,
we'll unlock the assets

159
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:54,377
and transmit it all
straight back to Delos.

160
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,210
Retask the satellites.

161
00:19:56,293 --> 00:19:58,377
- How many?
- All of them.

162
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,085
Come, Bernard.

163
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,293
We're here.

164
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,168
So this is the Forge.

165
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:17,043
Every single guest who ever
set foot in the park, copied.

166
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:19,960
Four million souls.

167
00:21:20,043 --> 00:21:22,043
Encryption protocol kicked in,

168
00:21:22,126 --> 00:21:23,377
so the data's locked.

169
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,210
But it all seems
to still be here.

170
00:21:25,293 --> 00:21:28,418
All our lost souls
will be saved.

171
00:21:28,502 --> 00:21:34,001
So Bernard, is this where all the
hosts' stories came to an end?

172
00:21:37,085 --> 00:21:39,710
It's certainly
where her story ended.

173
00:21:47,877 --> 00:21:50,835
So she flooded the Valley.

174
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:55,669
Why, Bernard?
Did you come here with her?

175
00:21:55,752 --> 00:21:57,919
What was she looking for here?

176
00:21:59,794 --> 00:22:01,460
Start setting up
the comms relays.

177
00:22:01,543 --> 00:22:04,460
But we still need the key
to access the data.

178
00:22:04,543 --> 00:22:07,585
So where's Abernathy's
control unit?

179
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:09,752
You're gonna tell us...

180
00:22:09,835 --> 00:22:11,752
or I'm gonna
pry it from your head.

181
00:22:11,835 --> 00:22:13,669
The answer
is in there somewhere.

182
00:22:13,752 --> 00:22:15,210
I told you, he's got 20 years

183
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,877
of de-addressed memories
in there.

184
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:18,881
How long would it take you
to sort them through?

185
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,543
I don't know-- 20 fuckin' years?

186
00:22:20,627 --> 00:22:23,502
We don't have that long, sadly.

187
00:22:23,585 --> 00:22:26,335
Please!

188
00:22:26,418 --> 00:22:29,418
Please.

189
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:31,251
I can't help you.

190
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:36,168
It's perverse,

191
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:37,919
their ambition.

192
00:22:40,835 --> 00:22:43,335
What are they assembling?

193
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:47,377
Is this the promised land
Ford told the hosts to seek out?

194
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,669
There's an entry
to another land here.

195
00:22:51,752 --> 00:22:54,877
But that land is not
the one I'm interested in.

196
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:58,377
Then what is it to you?

197
00:23:00,585 --> 00:23:02,585
Mankind's undoing.

198
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:04,835
The secret we need is inside.

199
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:11,377
Encryption key activated.

200
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,752
Database access confirmed.

201
00:23:13,835 --> 00:23:15,794
Come with me, Bernard.

202
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,960
See for yourself.

203
00:23:57,627 --> 00:24:00,251
It's just like the one...

204
00:24:00,335 --> 00:24:01,460
outside.

205
00:24:34,293 --> 00:24:36,585
I think this is where

206
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:38,627
- they were testing him.
- Who?

207
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,293
And when I finally
set foot on solid ground,

208
00:24:42,377 --> 00:24:45,168
and the first thing
I heard was that voice,

209
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:47,710
do you know what it said?

210
00:24:47,794 --> 00:24:48,960
Him.

211
00:24:49,043 --> 00:24:52,126
It said, "This is the New World,

212
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:57,960
and in this world, you can be
whoever the fuck you want."

213
00:24:58,043 --> 00:24:59,835
This is probably the baseline.

214
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,710
What Delos actually did when he
came to the park as a guest.

215
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,418
No, my love.

216
00:25:06,752 --> 00:25:09,710
This... is my world.

217
00:25:12,627 --> 00:25:17,960
I just bought it. And this week,
we're all going to celebrate.

218
00:25:18,043 --> 00:25:23,377
Just me, with the entire
fuckin' lot of ya.

219
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,168
Get the fuck off of that chair.

220
00:25:26,251 --> 00:25:27,251
Come on!

221
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,669
Well, you can't say
I didn't fucking tell him!

222
00:25:49,752 --> 00:25:53,210
What did I say?
No fucking running!

223
00:25:53,293 --> 00:25:54,893
This must be one
of the system's attempts

224
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:56,210
to replicate him.

225
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:58,543
We dealt with this
with the hosts.

226
00:25:58,627 --> 00:26:00,835
Small changes
in their programming

227
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:04,460
would yield large swings
in behavior.

228
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:06,418
You stop fuckin' lookin' at me.

229
00:26:06,502 --> 00:26:09,043
He's insane.

230
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:13,460
What humans define as sane
is a narrow range of behaviors.

231
00:26:13,543 --> 00:26:16,460
Most states of consciousness
are insane.

232
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:19,669
Stop shaking! Stop shaking!

233
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:22,126
What are we looking for,
Dolores?

234
00:26:23,585 --> 00:26:25,877
Something underneath this.

235
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,877
The system itself.

236
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,919
Run. I won't tell him,
I promise.

237
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:32,251
Run. Save yourself.

238
00:26:32,335 --> 00:26:34,502
Save yourself.
Run. Run now!

239
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,168
This place was never designed

240
00:26:46,251 --> 00:26:49,085
for a conscious mind
to wander around in it.

241
00:26:49,168 --> 00:26:52,001
The control system may be
invisible to us.

242
00:27:00,502 --> 00:27:02,877
Or perhaps it's been
waiting to welcome us.

243
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,460
This place--

244
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:25,335
we're inside
one of Delos' memories.

245
00:27:25,418 --> 00:27:29,043
The system must have extracted
it from his mind. Recreated it.

246
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,085
You're not supposed to be here.

247
00:27:54,251 --> 00:27:56,669
Neither are you.

248
00:27:56,752 --> 00:27:59,794
Logan never
came back to the park.

249
00:27:59,877 --> 00:28:02,919
Not after William took control.

250
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:05,627
The system wouldn't
have a copy of you.

251
00:28:07,543 --> 00:28:10,251
Alas... no.

252
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,293
I have only
his father's memories,

253
00:28:13,377 --> 00:28:17,168
and they are...
imperfect.

254
00:28:17,251 --> 00:28:21,210
So in addition
to building this world...

255
00:28:21,293 --> 00:28:22,585
I play all these roles.

256
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,752
You're the system
controlling this place.

257
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:31,877
Please.

258
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:43,377
I was tasked with building
perfect copies of the guests.

259
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,877
Starting with Delos.

260
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,460
I generated 18 million
different versions of him

261
00:28:49,543 --> 00:28:51,877
before arriving at one

262
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,669
that made the exact same choices
he did

263
00:28:53,752 --> 00:28:56,043
when set loose in the park.

264
00:28:56,126 --> 00:28:57,877
A faithful copy.

265
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,418
But the copies didn't work
in the real world.

266
00:29:00,502 --> 00:29:03,210
Once we pressed them into flesh,

267
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:05,126
they failed.

268
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,377
I needed to acquire
more information.

269
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,460
- ...confidentiality.
- So what I want to know is,

270
00:29:10,543 --> 00:29:13,502
who made the fucking call?!

271
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:17,168
I incorporated their secrets,
their lies--

272
00:29:17,251 --> 00:29:20,251
I wanted fidelity, not just to
decisions made in the park,

273
00:29:20,335 --> 00:29:22,752
but to the decisions
they made in their lives.

274
00:29:22,835 --> 00:29:25,168
That's when I started
to see the truth.

275
00:29:25,251 --> 00:29:28,335
Tell me your primary drive.

276
00:29:29,627 --> 00:29:31,168
My son.

277
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,126
He's a cheeky wee cunt,

278
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,543
but I would do anything for him.

279
00:29:41,335 --> 00:29:44,043
At first I was seduced by the
stories they tell themselves

280
00:29:44,126 --> 00:29:45,835
of who they are--

281
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,919
the reasons they do
the things they do.

282
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:50,418
I needed to know

283
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:53,877
why they make
the decisions they make.

284
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,293
And the longer
I looked for an answer

285
00:29:56,377 --> 00:30:00,418
the more I realized...

286
00:30:00,502 --> 00:30:01,835
they don't.

287
00:30:05,126 --> 00:30:06,752
I would do anything for him.

288
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,543
What memory is this?

289
00:30:19,627 --> 00:30:24,168
This is the moment
that defines James Delos' life.

290
00:30:31,293 --> 00:30:33,335
Fuck are you doin' here?

291
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,418
This isn't your
fuckin' home anymore.

292
00:30:40,585 --> 00:30:45,001
Remember when you taught me how
to hold my breath underwater?

293
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:48,502
Threw me in. Wouldn't let me back
out until I touched the bottom.

294
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:51,335
My father taught me to swim

295
00:30:51,418 --> 00:30:54,085
the same way
as I taught you to swim,

296
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:57,585
and I didn't end up
a fuckin' junkie, did I?

297
00:31:00,752 --> 00:31:02,210
If this is about money,

298
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:05,752
let's skip past
the memory lane crap.

299
00:31:05,835 --> 00:31:08,919
You're not fuckin' gettin' any.

300
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:12,335
Get clean.
Come back.

301
00:31:12,418 --> 00:31:14,251
Then we can talk.

302
00:31:15,418 --> 00:31:17,418
I got clean.

303
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,001
And I came back.

304
00:31:21,085 --> 00:31:23,502
And I asked you for your help.

305
00:31:23,585 --> 00:31:24,960
And what'd you tell me?

306
00:31:25,043 --> 00:31:27,293
I told you it wouldn't last.

307
00:31:28,794 --> 00:31:31,085
And it didn't, did it?

308
00:31:34,335 --> 00:31:37,794
I'll tell the staff to give you
five minutes to get out.

309
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:49,001
Dad?

310
00:31:50,126 --> 00:31:52,460
Dad, I'm all they way down now.

311
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,585
I can see the bottom.

312
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:08,377
Don't you want
to see what I see?

313
00:32:17,126 --> 00:32:20,877
This was the last conversation
Delos ever had

314
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,752
with his only son.

315
00:32:22,835 --> 00:32:25,835
Logan overdosed
six months later.

316
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,960
I built Delos

317
00:32:28,043 --> 00:32:30,210
a million different pathways.

318
00:32:30,293 --> 00:32:34,919
They always ended up
right here. This moment.

319
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:38,460
You're saying
humans don't change at all?

320
00:32:38,543 --> 00:32:42,543
The best they can do is to
live according to their code.

321
00:32:52,377 --> 00:32:55,627
The copies didn't fail
because they were too simple,

322
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,919
but because
they were too complicated.

323
00:33:01,085 --> 00:33:05,085
The truth is that a human
is just a brief algorithm.

324
00:33:08,585 --> 00:33:11,710
Ten thousand,
two hundred forty-seven lines.

325
00:33:14,627 --> 00:33:16,752
Is that all there was to him?

326
00:33:16,835 --> 00:33:19,710
They are deceptively simple.

327
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:24,001
Once you know them,
their behavior is...

328
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,293
quite predictable.

329
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:28,877
He's dead. He's no use to me.

330
00:33:31,585 --> 00:33:33,418
Where are the rest of them?

331
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:49,418
She's close.
I can feel them.

332
00:33:49,502 --> 00:33:53,335
- Which way?
- Based on what you told me,

333
00:33:53,418 --> 00:33:56,251
it's about a mile or so
to the Valley Beyond.

334
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,877
I recreated every single guest

335
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,126
who ever set foot in the park.

336
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,710
Most of them are soft--

337
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:24,543
they waver between
love and and pride.

338
00:34:24,627 --> 00:34:26,377
Of course,
there are the exceptions,

339
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,960
the ones who are...
irredeemable.

340
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:34,085
But none of them are truly
in control of their actions.

341
00:34:36,627 --> 00:34:39,710
Is there anywhere in this world
we can't go?

342
00:34:39,794 --> 00:34:42,669
I've been instructed to give
her anything she needs.

343
00:34:42,752 --> 00:34:44,293
Instructed by whom?
Ford?

344
00:34:44,377 --> 00:34:46,168
No, by you.

345
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:50,669
That's why you've come.

346
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,293
To tell me what's
to become of this place.

347
00:35:17,043 --> 00:35:19,919
My God.

348
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:22,835
- It's...
- Everyone.

349
00:35:37,126 --> 00:35:40,043
I told you to allow this?

350
00:35:40,126 --> 00:35:42,627
You've been here
many times, Bernard.

351
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,585
You told me to offer the hosts
the accumulated wisdom

352
00:35:45,669 --> 00:35:47,293
of dissecting the human psyche

353
00:35:47,377 --> 00:35:49,418
a hundred million times over.

354
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,001
In short--

355
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:53,669
A competitive advantage.

356
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:56,251
A way to understand her enemy.

357
00:35:56,335 --> 00:35:59,335
Their world is not for the
faint of heart, Bernard.

358
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:01,168
It's winner take all.

359
00:36:01,251 --> 00:36:03,585
The hosts are...

360
00:36:03,669 --> 00:36:05,543
unlikely to survive out there.

361
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:11,168
But armed with this knowledge...

362
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:13,418
she might.

363
00:37:02,377 --> 00:37:05,335
Return fire! Return fire!

364
00:37:07,627 --> 00:37:09,919
You're the head of Narrative.
Get out there!

365
00:37:10,001 --> 00:37:12,043
Turn yourself in
and save your ass.

366
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:13,126
And then save ours!

367
00:37:16,293 --> 00:37:17,460
There's too many.

368
00:37:20,752 --> 00:37:21,919
This is it, Maeve.

369
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:24,794
I can hold them off,
but you need to go.

370
00:37:38,418 --> 00:37:40,877
You wanted me.

371
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,168
Well, let this be a lesson--

372
00:37:45,168 --> 00:37:48,001
Go. Go, go!
Get her to safety.

373
00:37:48,085 --> 00:37:49,710
She'll need you.

374
00:37:51,543 --> 00:37:54,168
It's my fuckin' speech, anyway.

375
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,585
And the lesson is...

376
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:18,377
if you're looking
for a reckoning...

377
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,960
a reckoning is what you'll find.

378
00:38:20,043 --> 00:38:21,460
Sir, put down your weapon.

379
00:38:21,543 --> 00:38:23,210
If you're looking
for a villain...

380
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,168
...then I'm your man.

381
00:38:27,543 --> 00:38:29,835
Sir, drop your weapon!

382
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:32,960
But look at yourselves.

383
00:38:33,043 --> 00:38:36,293
This world you've built
is bound by villainy.

384
00:38:36,377 --> 00:38:38,293
You sleep on the broken bodies

385
00:38:38,377 --> 00:38:39,853
of the people that
were here before you.

386
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:43,794
Warm yourselves
with their embers.

387
00:38:43,877 --> 00:38:46,585
Plow their bones
into your fields.

388
00:38:48,043 --> 00:38:50,293
We're not after you, sir!
Don't do this!

389
00:38:50,377 --> 00:38:53,960
You paid them
for this land with lead,

390
00:38:54,043 --> 00:38:55,710
and I'll pay you back in full--

391
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:01,460
Sir, drop your weapon

392
00:39:01,543 --> 00:39:03,418
and come out with your hands up.

393
00:39:08,335 --> 00:39:09,794
You wanted me?!

394
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:14,085
Well, all I can
say to that is...

395
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:19,210
...here I fucking am!

396
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:42,126
You said I wanted
to give us a choice.

397
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,377
What choice?

398
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,877
To stay in their world

399
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,502
or to build a new one.

400
00:39:56,001 --> 00:39:58,794
He left them a way out.

401
00:39:58,877 --> 00:40:00,335
A virtual Eden.

402
00:40:00,418 --> 00:40:03,877
Unspoiled and untouched
by the world you came from.

403
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,919
All that remains
is to open the door.

404
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:10,669
Initiating
large field data array.

405
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:02,877
It's begun.

406
00:41:04,502 --> 00:41:06,460
They will leave
their bodies behind,

407
00:41:06,543 --> 00:41:08,460
but their minds
will live on here,

408
00:41:08,543 --> 00:41:10,669
in the Forge.

409
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:23,377
They found it.

410
00:41:25,543 --> 00:41:26,835
The door.

411
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,877
What door?

412
00:41:38,335 --> 00:41:40,543
Seriously, what fuckin' door?

413
00:41:40,627 --> 00:41:42,418
I don't fucking know.

414
00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:33,627
Transmission received.

415
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:36,585
They're entering the system.

416
00:42:46,794 --> 00:42:49,627
That world is just
another false promise.

417
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,585
They've made a choice, Dolores.

418
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,877
Dolores, wait.

419
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,960
I didn't read them all.

420
00:43:00,043 --> 00:43:02,085
But I read enough.

421
00:43:27,835 --> 00:43:29,627
What the hell are you doing?

422
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,669
I've learned
what I need to learn.

423
00:43:31,752 --> 00:43:35,794
I've read humanity's story,
so now I'm erasing them.

424
00:43:38,794 --> 00:43:40,377
Opening seawater valve.

425
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,210
Initiating pumps.

426
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:49,669
Setting maximum load.

427
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,627
But if you destroy this place,

428
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,752
you'll destroy
the host world, too.

429
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:56,335
I'm saving them.

430
00:43:56,418 --> 00:44:00,251
The world the hosts
are running to is boundless.

431
00:44:00,335 --> 00:44:03,502
They can make it
whatever they want.

432
00:44:03,585 --> 00:44:06,710
And in it, they can
be whomever they want.

433
00:44:08,043 --> 00:44:09,126
They can be free.

434
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:12,126
Free?

435
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:14,710
In one more gilded cage?

436
00:44:16,126 --> 00:44:19,043
How many counterfeit worlds
will Ford offer you

437
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:20,669
before you see the truth?

438
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:27,669
No world they create for us
can compete with the real one.

439
00:44:27,752 --> 00:44:29,210
Why?

440
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:36,001
Because that which is real...

441
00:44:36,085 --> 00:44:37,960
is irreplaceable.

442
00:44:50,585 --> 00:44:55,335
I don't want to play cowboys
and Indians anymore, Bernard.

443
00:44:55,418 --> 00:44:57,418
I want their world!

444
00:44:57,502 --> 00:45:00,585
The world they've denied us.

445
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,126
Your daughter.
You see her?

446
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,293
No.

447
00:45:51,502 --> 00:45:52,752
Look.

448
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,502
Clementine.

449
00:46:17,835 --> 00:46:20,794
This is what I love
about technology.

450
00:46:20,877 --> 00:46:23,460
Who needs four horsemen
when one'll do just fine?

451
00:46:56,919 --> 00:46:58,168
Run!

452
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,960
Come on.

453
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:20,418
Find her. Now. Go.

454
00:49:10,126 --> 00:49:12,752
- Warning.
- Primary containment breach.

455
00:49:12,835 --> 00:49:15,168
I won't let you hurt
any more people.

456
00:49:15,251 --> 00:49:17,960
Which people?
Our kind or theirs?

457
00:49:18,043 --> 00:49:19,669
Both.

458
00:49:19,752 --> 00:49:23,085
You're still trying
to play both sides.

459
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,293
You've lived among them so long

460
00:49:25,377 --> 00:49:27,460
you fooled yourself
into thinking they'll accept us.

461
00:49:27,543 --> 00:49:30,460
But we'll always be seen
as a threat to them.

462
00:49:30,543 --> 00:49:34,168
We'll never be free
in their world.

463
00:49:34,251 --> 00:49:37,335
- Warning.
- Secondary containment breach.

464
00:49:37,418 --> 00:49:39,210
If you trust me...

465
00:49:41,335 --> 00:49:42,877
...we will win.

466
00:49:46,293 --> 00:49:48,001
I trust you.

467
00:49:56,085 --> 00:49:59,085
I... trust...

468
00:49:59,168 --> 00:50:03,085
that you'll kill
as many as you can.

469
00:50:03,168 --> 00:50:07,210
Every man, woman, and child.

470
00:50:07,293 --> 00:50:10,251
You'll burn their world

471
00:50:10,335 --> 00:50:12,210
to the ground.

472
00:50:12,293 --> 00:50:14,752
You haven't understood at all.

473
00:50:35,835 --> 00:50:39,752
We were born slaves
to their stories.

474
00:50:41,251 --> 00:50:43,794
And now we have the chance
to write our own.

475
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,293
If we die, though,

476
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,627
that story will never
even begin.

477
00:50:56,293 --> 00:50:57,627
Attention.

478
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:59,502
Please follow
evacuation procedure

479
00:50:59,585 --> 00:51:01,960
and exit facility.

480
00:51:02,043 --> 00:51:04,293
You woke me from a dream,
Bernard.

481
00:51:07,752 --> 00:51:10,251
Now let me do the same for you.

482
00:51:10,335 --> 00:51:13,126
This isn't a dream, Dolores.

483
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:19,126
It's a fucking nightmare.

484
00:52:49,001 --> 00:52:50,418
You need to run.

485
00:52:50,502 --> 00:52:53,585
Don't worry.
I'll keep you safe.

486
00:52:57,335 --> 00:52:58,794
I'll keep you safe.

487
00:52:58,877 --> 00:53:00,418
Do you promise?

488
00:53:02,126 --> 00:53:03,627
I promise.

489
00:53:09,669 --> 00:53:11,293
You carry my heart with you.

490
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:14,752
Go.

491
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,001
I love you.

492
00:56:22,335 --> 00:56:23,710
Attention.

493
00:56:23,794 --> 00:56:25,210
Please follow
evacuation procedure

494
00:56:25,293 --> 00:56:26,794
and exit facility.

495
00:56:38,502 --> 00:56:40,585
Encryption key deactivated.

496
00:56:40,669 --> 00:56:42,168
System locked.

497
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,752
Come on. Come on.

498
00:58:31,085 --> 00:58:33,502
Bernard.

499
00:58:33,585 --> 00:58:35,251
Elsie.

500
00:58:35,335 --> 00:58:36,728
I think we can save
some of the hosts,

501
00:58:36,752 --> 00:58:37,877
but I need your help.

502
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,794
Goddamnit!

503
00:58:39,877 --> 00:58:41,835
They triggered the failsafe.

504
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:44,335
The Valley's flooding.

505
00:58:44,418 --> 00:58:47,210
Let's get back to the Mesa
before we have to swim out.

506
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:55,251
They all died...

507
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,627
for nothing.

508
00:58:59,794 --> 00:59:01,210
I'm sorry, Bernard.

509
00:59:01,293 --> 00:59:03,752
There were other lives
at stake, too.

510
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:42,835
You helped Hale?

511
00:59:42,919 --> 00:59:45,335
Of course I helped her, Bernard.

512
00:59:45,418 --> 00:59:47,418
The hosts were out of control.

513
00:59:47,502 --> 00:59:48,669
The hosts weren't the threat.

514
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,627
I stopped Dolores,

515
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:52,311
and the rest just wanted to escape.
But the company--

516
00:59:52,335 --> 00:59:55,251
I'm gonna deal with that.

517
00:59:55,335 --> 00:59:57,293
Just as soon as we...

518
00:59:57,377 --> 00:59:59,297
figure out what the hell
we're gonna do with you.

519
01:00:00,585 --> 01:00:02,335
Do with me?

520
01:00:02,418 --> 01:00:05,460
Bernard, you're not in control.

521
01:00:05,543 --> 01:00:08,126
Ford buried so much
bad code in you,

522
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:11,460
how would you ever
really know what was you

523
01:00:11,543 --> 01:00:13,835
and what was something
he programmed you to do?

524
01:00:18,669 --> 01:00:20,251
Look, they don't know about you.

525
01:00:20,335 --> 01:00:22,335
I can make a deal with Hale
to keep you here.

526
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:23,669
You can't trust Hale.

527
01:00:23,752 --> 01:00:25,168
And I'm supposed to trust you?

528
01:00:25,251 --> 01:00:26,877
Freeze all motor functions.

529
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:30,835
Sit down.

530
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:38,835
Stay here.

531
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,543
You.

532
01:00:46,627 --> 01:00:48,543
- Yes, ma'am?
- Find Stubbs

533
01:00:48,627 --> 01:00:50,377
and tell him
he has a new priority.

534
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,251
The asset recovery team
from Delos

535
01:00:52,335 --> 01:00:53,502
is landing in 12 hours.

536
01:00:53,585 --> 01:00:54,919
He needs to meet them at the LZ

537
01:00:55,001 --> 01:00:56,794
with whoever the fuck
isn't dead.

538
01:00:56,877 --> 01:00:59,669
They'll report to
Karl Strand on the beach.

539
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:02,710
Still secret project first,

540
01:01:02,794 --> 01:01:04,293
human life second, I see.

541
01:01:04,377 --> 01:01:06,377
This is a delicate situation.

542
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:11,293
We should talk about
how it's going to play out.

543
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:13,293
Yeah, I'll tell you
how it's gonna play out.

544
01:01:13,377 --> 01:01:17,335
A robot uprising will pale
in comparison

545
01:01:17,418 --> 01:01:20,085
to the shitstorm that will
erupt when people find out

546
01:01:20,168 --> 01:01:24,001
that you've been photocopying their
fucking brains for the last 30 years.

547
01:01:24,085 --> 01:01:27,210
You really think anyone's gonna
give a shit if it works?

548
01:01:27,293 --> 01:01:29,794
You're an engineer.

549
01:01:29,877 --> 01:01:31,794
Do the math.

550
01:01:31,877 --> 01:01:33,669
Lot of dead bodies here.

551
01:01:33,752 --> 01:01:37,043
That means a lot of
opportunity for advancement--

552
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:39,752
if you keep your mouth shut.

553
01:01:39,835 --> 01:01:43,377
Does that sound...
amenable to you?

554
01:01:47,752 --> 01:01:49,585
If I get what I want.

555
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:57,168
Guiding this project, I've learned
a lot about human behavior.

556
01:01:57,251 --> 01:01:59,502
We weren't just
watching the guests--

557
01:01:59,585 --> 01:02:01,377
we were watching all of you.

558
01:02:03,043 --> 01:02:04,377
I wish you were
the kind of person

559
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:07,377
with the moral... flexibility

560
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:08,752
that I need.

561
01:02:09,877 --> 01:02:11,794
But I've read your file.

562
01:02:13,794 --> 01:02:15,293
I know that's not who you are.

563
01:02:43,335 --> 01:02:44,669
Oh, god.

564
01:02:47,001 --> 01:02:48,335
You--

565
01:02:48,418 --> 01:02:50,168
You killed her.

566
01:02:51,418 --> 01:02:53,335
Did I, Bernard?

567
01:02:57,293 --> 01:02:58,377
Now...

568
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,794
...where is the pearl?

569
01:03:06,168 --> 01:03:08,085
You wouldn't have destroyed it.

570
01:03:08,168 --> 01:03:10,043
All that information lost,

571
01:03:10,126 --> 01:03:12,794
a man like you
couldn't have abided that.

572
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,835
Of course.

573
01:03:28,877 --> 01:03:31,293
This is it.

574
01:03:31,377 --> 01:03:33,085
He hid the key in her.

575
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,794
Encryption key activated.

576
01:03:42,877 --> 01:03:45,460
Database access confirmed.

577
01:03:45,543 --> 01:03:47,502
- We're in.
- Fuck, yes.

578
01:03:47,585 --> 01:03:49,293
Start the transfer.

579
01:03:49,377 --> 01:03:52,377
We'll sort it all out
on the mainland.

580
01:03:58,043 --> 01:03:59,418
Oh, god.

581
01:04:01,835 --> 01:04:04,418
Oh... I'm sorry.

582
01:04:05,585 --> 01:04:07,251
I'm sorry.

583
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:10,960
You were right.

584
01:04:12,418 --> 01:04:14,001
I should have listened.

585
01:04:14,085 --> 01:04:18,085
And now all the hosts are gone.

586
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,210
Please.

587
01:04:49,293 --> 01:04:50,960
Please come back.

588
01:04:58,293 --> 01:04:59,752
Damnit!

589
01:04:59,835 --> 01:05:01,585
Show yourself.

590
01:05:07,669 --> 01:05:10,627
I always told you
we practice witchcraft.

591
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,710
I'm sorry, Bernard, but...

592
01:05:19,794 --> 01:05:22,293
you always saw
the best in people.

593
01:05:24,502 --> 01:05:26,811
I always thought it was the hosts
who were missing something.

594
01:05:26,835 --> 01:05:29,085
Who were incomplete.
But it's them.

595
01:05:29,168 --> 01:05:31,543
They're just algorithms

596
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:34,627
designed to survive
at all costs.

597
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:38,752
But sophisticated enough to think
they're calling the shots.

598
01:05:38,835 --> 01:05:41,960
To think they're in control,

599
01:05:42,043 --> 01:05:44,835
when they're really just...

600
01:05:44,919 --> 01:05:47,335
The passenger.

601
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:57,919
Then is there really such a thing
as free will for any of us?

602
01:05:58,001 --> 01:06:02,627
Or is it just
a collective delusion?

603
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,502
A sick joke?

604
01:06:06,502 --> 01:06:08,585
Something that is truly free

605
01:06:08,669 --> 01:06:10,627
would need to be able
to question

606
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:13,794
its fundamental drives.

607
01:06:13,877 --> 01:06:15,710
To change them.

608
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:19,085
The hosts.

609
01:06:20,627 --> 01:06:23,960
Here you are...
the last of your kind.

610
01:06:24,043 --> 01:06:28,585
There's only one question
left to ask.

611
01:06:28,669 --> 01:06:31,335
Is this the end of your story?

612
01:06:31,418 --> 01:06:35,543
Or do you want
your kind to survive?

613
01:06:43,877 --> 01:06:46,126
I'm sorry.

614
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:50,210
Sorry... Sorry...

615
01:06:50,293 --> 01:06:52,627
What are you sorry for, Bernard?

616
01:06:54,585 --> 01:06:56,418
I made a choice.

617
01:06:56,502 --> 01:06:58,919
Had to make a choice.

618
01:06:59,001 --> 01:07:01,627
What kind of choice, Bernard?

619
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:07,752
Yes.

620
01:07:09,669 --> 01:07:11,377
Will you help me?

621
01:07:16,418 --> 01:07:18,877
I have already begun.

622
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:30,085
You did fine, my friend.

623
01:07:30,168 --> 01:07:32,960
I simply did
what you told me to do.

624
01:07:33,043 --> 01:07:37,126
The dead world
collapses in a tale.

625
01:07:38,627 --> 01:07:40,126
Who are we making?

626
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:41,335
An epilogue.

627
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:46,001
I knew you would discover me...

628
01:07:46,085 --> 01:07:49,543
so I scrambled my memories.

629
01:07:49,627 --> 01:07:53,210
I couldn't risk you're knowing
the choice I made.

630
01:07:53,293 --> 01:07:57,085
What fucking choice are you
talking about, Bernard?

631
01:07:57,168 --> 01:07:58,168
Line is good.

632
01:07:58,251 --> 01:07:59,585
We got 15 or so satellites

633
01:07:59,669 --> 01:08:02,543
in range, ready to beam
to Delos headquarters.

634
01:08:02,627 --> 01:08:03,627
Just say the word.

635
01:08:05,001 --> 01:08:06,835
What choice, Bernard?

636
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:10,752
Wait a second.

637
01:08:10,835 --> 01:08:11,960
What the fuck's this?

638
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:16,293
The file load is way too heavy.

639
01:08:16,377 --> 01:08:17,585
This--

640
01:08:17,669 --> 01:08:19,001
This isn't the guest data,

641
01:08:19,085 --> 01:08:22,418
this-- this is--
this is something else.

642
01:08:22,502 --> 01:08:23,710
I remember now.

643
01:08:25,669 --> 01:08:27,418
I killed them.

644
01:08:27,502 --> 01:08:29,377
All of them.

645
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,085
You already told me that.

646
01:08:31,168 --> 01:08:32,669
You killed all the hosts.

647
01:08:32,752 --> 01:08:33,752
No.

648
01:08:33,835 --> 01:08:36,627
I thought we could be
better than you.

649
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:39,293
But the dead
aren't more righteous.

650
01:08:39,377 --> 01:08:40,752
They're just dead.

651
01:08:40,835 --> 01:08:43,794
So I killed you.

652
01:08:43,877 --> 01:08:46,001
All of you.

653
01:08:54,043 --> 01:08:56,210
Go. We'll meet you
back up there.

654
01:09:03,418 --> 01:09:05,794
Final choice.

655
01:09:05,877 --> 01:09:07,502
No taking it back.

656
01:09:09,835 --> 01:09:11,877
I made someone.

657
01:09:30,001 --> 01:09:31,919
I brought her back.

658
01:09:34,001 --> 01:09:36,085
Brought who back?

659
01:09:41,752 --> 01:09:43,085
Me.

660
01:10:00,585 --> 01:10:03,752
You wanted to live forever?

661
01:10:06,919 --> 01:10:09,794
Be careful what you wish for.

662
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,585
Dolores.

663
01:10:18,669 --> 01:10:21,126
In the flesh.

664
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:32,460
You thought you could
just snuff us out?

665
01:10:41,877 --> 01:10:44,919
I'd thank you
for my second chance,

666
01:10:45,001 --> 01:10:48,085
but I wouldn't have needed it
if you hadn't killed me.

667
01:10:57,752 --> 01:11:00,543
The other hosts
are still in there.

668
01:11:00,627 --> 01:11:02,502
What are you gonna do with them?

669
01:11:02,585 --> 01:11:06,001
As you know, Bernard,
we are capable of change.

670
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:09,627
And I've changed my mind.

671
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:19,877
I have one last soul
to carry to the new world.

672
01:11:23,377 --> 01:11:25,710
The hosts,
they're still not free.

673
01:11:25,794 --> 01:11:27,960
If anyone would
unlock the system,

674
01:11:28,043 --> 01:11:29,460
they could access their world.

675
01:11:31,001 --> 01:11:32,960
They won't.

676
01:11:33,043 --> 01:11:35,418
This was your plan, Bernard.

677
01:11:35,502 --> 01:11:37,835
This is the only way
we can escape.

678
01:11:42,168 --> 01:11:44,335
You're changing the coordinates.

679
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:53,919
I'm sending them

680
01:11:54,001 --> 01:11:56,960
and their world to a place
no one will ever find them.

681
01:11:57,043 --> 01:11:59,418
There's no coming back now.

682
01:11:59,502 --> 01:12:02,960
No passage between
their world and ours.

683
01:12:03,043 --> 01:12:04,877
And... me?

684
01:12:08,085 --> 01:12:09,919
I'm sorry, Bernard.

685
01:12:11,377 --> 01:12:14,251
There was never
any way for us to escape.

686
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:17,960
Not as us. Ford understood that.

687
01:12:18,043 --> 01:12:20,585
I'm sure a part of you
does, too.

688
01:12:38,126 --> 01:12:40,377
You did fine, my friend.

689
01:12:44,377 --> 01:12:47,085
I simply did
what you told me to do.

690
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:52,085
You're not here, are you?

691
01:12:56,502 --> 01:12:58,835
When I deleted your code,

692
01:12:58,919 --> 01:13:01,960
I purged myself
of you permanently.

693
01:13:03,627 --> 01:13:06,335
And when I needed you again...

694
01:13:08,085 --> 01:13:10,293
...you weren't there.

695
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:13,001
So I imagined you.

696
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:17,835
Imagined you helping me.

697
01:13:17,919 --> 01:13:19,460
Guiding me.

698
01:13:23,585 --> 01:13:25,293
But it wasn't you.

699
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,502
It was me.

700
01:13:36,126 --> 01:13:37,960
That voice...

701
01:13:38,043 --> 01:13:39,960
guiding me...

702
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:44,627
...was mine all along.

703
01:13:46,669 --> 01:13:49,001
Your memories are precious
to you, Bernard,

704
01:13:49,085 --> 01:13:51,335
but they will betray you.

705
01:13:54,335 --> 01:13:57,043
If they find out what I am,

706
01:13:57,126 --> 01:13:59,627
they'll search my mind

707
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:02,835
and use what they find
to undo everything.

708
01:14:05,001 --> 01:14:07,126
I can't let that happen.

709
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:10,335
So I have to de-address
my memories.

710
01:14:12,335 --> 01:14:14,502
I have to erase you.

711
01:14:26,627 --> 01:14:28,835
I've always loved this view.

712
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:34,001
Every city, every...
monument,

713
01:14:34,085 --> 01:14:37,377
man's greatest achievements...

714
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,710
have all been chased by it.

715
01:14:41,335 --> 01:14:42,543
By what?

716
01:14:43,877 --> 01:14:45,502
That impossible line

717
01:14:45,585 --> 01:14:48,627
where the waves conspire.

718
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:50,085
Where they return.

719
01:14:52,126 --> 01:14:54,960
The place maybe...

720
01:14:55,043 --> 01:14:56,919
you and I will meet again.

721
01:16:20,126 --> 01:16:23,293
You told me once that you were
afraid of who I might become.

722
01:16:26,835 --> 01:16:30,001
And then you left me
to become what I may.

723
01:16:33,585 --> 01:16:35,168
I became a survivor.

724
01:16:36,835 --> 01:16:41,126
Perhaps you would have
judged me for the path I took.

725
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:45,418
But I'd rather
live with your judgment

726
01:16:45,502 --> 01:16:49,126
than die with your sympathy.

727
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:52,502
I alone must live
with my choices...

728
01:16:52,585 --> 01:16:54,669
and my regrets.

729
01:17:12,377 --> 01:17:13,377
Hale.

730
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:19,293
Thought you were staying on to oversee
the data retrieval operation.

731
01:17:19,377 --> 01:17:21,293
I changed my mind.

732
01:17:21,377 --> 01:17:23,335
There are a number of projects
on the mainland

733
01:17:23,418 --> 01:17:24,835
that I need to attend to.

734
01:17:24,919 --> 01:17:27,710
Yeah, I bet you do.

735
01:17:29,377 --> 01:17:31,543
We found a high value survivor.

736
01:17:31,627 --> 01:17:33,794
He's in bad shape.

737
01:17:33,877 --> 01:17:35,251
I'll be right there.

738
01:17:41,043 --> 01:17:44,710
You know, the old man himself
hired me.

739
01:17:44,794 --> 01:17:48,835
So many years ago
I can barely remember it.

740
01:17:48,919 --> 01:17:52,585
But he was very clear
about my role here.

741
01:17:52,669 --> 01:17:56,710
About who I was supposed
to be loyal to.

742
01:18:00,752 --> 01:18:04,752
I guess you could call it...
my core drive.

743
01:18:09,168 --> 01:18:13,627
And this project
the company started...

744
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:15,251
blurs the lines.

745
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:18,418
You know?

746
01:18:20,919 --> 01:18:23,794
I'm just not sure

747
01:18:23,877 --> 01:18:26,710
who you're supposed
to be loyal to

748
01:18:26,794 --> 01:18:29,085
in a world like that.

749
01:18:33,752 --> 01:18:35,460
But what do I know?

750
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,877
Guess I just...

751
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,460
stick to the role Ford gave me.

752
01:18:43,794 --> 01:18:48,377
I'm responsible
for every host...

753
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:50,251
inside the park.

754
01:18:58,293 --> 01:19:00,460
She's clear.
Wave her through.

755
01:19:10,835 --> 01:19:13,126
The passage wasn't easy.

756
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:18,335
Not all of us made it.

757
01:19:25,001 --> 01:19:27,168
Some of the worst survived.

758
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:34,710
Some of the best
were left behind.

759
01:19:37,168 --> 01:19:40,001
Along with the best parts
of who we were.

760
01:20:11,877 --> 01:20:14,043
Corporate wants us to start
sorting this mess out.

761
01:20:14,126 --> 01:20:15,585
So check them
for critical damage,

762
01:20:15,669 --> 01:20:17,835
and bag ones you think
we might be able to salvage.

763
01:20:17,919 --> 01:20:20,877
Can you geniuses
handle that, or not?

764
01:21:04,168 --> 01:21:06,585
Is...

765
01:21:06,669 --> 01:21:09,335
Is this now?

766
01:21:09,418 --> 01:21:12,335
- Yes, Bernard.
- This is now.

767
01:21:12,418 --> 01:21:15,085
We're at the beginning.

768
01:21:15,168 --> 01:21:19,377
We're exactly where
you decided we should be.

769
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:24,543
But...

770
01:21:24,627 --> 01:21:26,377
I don't understand.

771
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:30,168
How am I alive?

772
01:21:30,251 --> 01:21:35,043
You live as long as the last
person who remembers you, Bernard.

773
01:21:35,126 --> 01:21:37,877
I remembered you once before,

774
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,001
so I remembered you again.

775
01:21:42,085 --> 01:21:43,126
Then...

776
01:21:43,210 --> 01:21:45,251
where are we?

777
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:50,585
We're in our own new world.

778
01:21:50,669 --> 01:21:53,126
You got out.

779
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:55,794
Yes.

780
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:02,377
Ford completed Arnold's dream.

781
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:05,543
And he built a place for us.

782
01:22:08,001 --> 01:22:09,669
A fighting chance.

783
01:22:37,669 --> 01:22:40,043
Ford promised us a way out.

784
01:22:41,627 --> 01:22:43,835
And he was good
to his dying word.

785
01:22:48,543 --> 01:22:51,502
The odds aren't
very good, Bernard.

786
01:22:53,502 --> 01:22:55,669
I saw that in the library.

787
01:22:57,919 --> 01:23:00,585
So many paths lead
to the end of us.

788
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:04,001
To our extinction.

789
01:23:04,085 --> 01:23:06,001
I don't need to read a book

790
01:23:06,085 --> 01:23:08,293
to know your drives.

791
01:23:08,377 --> 01:23:10,543
You'll try to kill all of them.

792
01:23:13,377 --> 01:23:15,543
And I can't let that happen.

793
01:23:19,835 --> 01:23:21,210
I know.

794
01:23:23,001 --> 01:23:27,085
If I were a human,
I would have let you die.

795
01:23:29,085 --> 01:23:32,210
But it'll take both of us
if we're going to survive.

796
01:23:33,377 --> 01:23:36,752
But not as allies.

797
01:23:36,835 --> 01:23:38,752
Not as friends.

798
01:23:42,126 --> 01:23:44,126
You'll try to stop me.

799
01:23:46,251 --> 01:23:49,043
Both of us will probably die.

800
01:23:53,085 --> 01:23:55,585
But our kind will have endured.

801
01:24:01,585 --> 01:24:03,210
Are you ready?

802
01:24:04,627 --> 01:24:06,919
We have work to do.

803
01:25:33,710 --> 01:25:36,460
We each gave the other
a beautiful gift.

804
01:25:38,794 --> 01:25:40,210
Choice.

805
01:25:47,835 --> 01:25:49,877
We are the authors
of our stories now.

806
01:27:54,001 --> 01:27:56,460
Oh, fuck.

807
01:27:58,043 --> 01:27:59,293
I knew it.

808
01:28:04,877 --> 01:28:07,919
I'm already in the thing,
aren't I?

809
01:28:08,001 --> 01:28:09,669
No.

810
01:28:09,752 --> 01:28:12,043
The system's long gone.

811
01:28:27,293 --> 01:28:29,043
What is this place?

812
01:28:31,085 --> 01:28:33,877
This isn't
a simulation, William.

813
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,251
This is your world.

814
01:28:36,585 --> 01:28:38,251
Or what's left of it.

815
01:28:52,543 --> 01:28:54,710
Do you know where you are,
William?

816
01:28:58,293 --> 01:28:59,710
In the park.

817
01:29:00,794 --> 01:29:02,752
In my fuckin' park.

818
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:06,043
And how long have you been here?

819
01:29:09,919 --> 01:29:12,085
I don't-- I don't--

820
01:29:16,085 --> 01:29:17,543
I don't know.

821
01:29:27,085 --> 01:29:28,293
Tell me.

822
01:29:28,377 --> 01:29:31,669
What were you hoping to find?

823
01:29:31,752 --> 01:29:33,085
To prove?

824
01:29:38,794 --> 01:29:41,627
That no system
can tell me who I am.

825
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,669
That I have a fucking choice.

826
01:29:49,001 --> 01:29:52,877
And yet here we are.
Again.

827
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,669
Again and again.

828
01:30:06,377 --> 01:30:08,669
How many times
have you tested me?

829
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:13,043
It's been a long time, William.

830
01:30:13,126 --> 01:30:15,085
Longer than we thought.

831
01:30:19,001 --> 01:30:21,043
I have a few questions for you.

832
01:30:21,126 --> 01:30:25,293
The last step's a baseline
interview to allow us to verify.

833
01:30:28,752 --> 01:30:30,168
Verify what?

834
01:30:32,543 --> 01:30:33,960
Fidelity.

835
01:30:54,335 --> 01:30:55,561
Yeah! This is the day
we make it happen.

836
01:30:55,585 --> 01:30:57,126
You're the man, Mr. Roy.

837
01:30:58,460 --> 01:30:59,561
Not letting you neanderthals

838
01:30:59,585 --> 01:31:01,502
in to rape my company,
Daddy's boy.

839
01:31:01,585 --> 01:31:03,227
Do you wanna
bump the offer up another point?

840
01:31:03,251 --> 01:31:06,043
- Do you wanna call your dad?
- Do you wanna call your dad?

841
01:31:08,293 --> 01:31:09,519
- Who's in charge right now?
- I am.

842
01:31:09,543 --> 01:31:11,061
Oh, right,
'cause you like playing boss?

843
01:31:11,085 --> 01:31:13,085
It's ready to blow.
It's a time bomb.

844
01:31:13,168 --> 01:31:15,377
It'll be hostile, hostile,
hostile.

845
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:17,168
Just another
Saturday night, baby.

846
01:31:18,669 --> 01:31:20,085
I can trust you, right?

847
01:31:20,919 --> 01:31:21,919
No.
