This is the home Arnold was
building for his family.

361
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,085
He created it here first.

362
00:28:49,545 --> 00:28:51,463
He created everything here.

363
00:29:08,891 --> 00:29:11,233

I could hardly let you take
those first teetering steps

366
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:19,883
in the real world, Bernard.

367
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:23,828
We refined you here.

368

Tested you.

369
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,349
For many years.

00:29:30,265 --> 00:29:32,681
Delos's ugly little project

372
00:29:32,682 --> 00:29:35,065
didn't exist when Arnold died.

373
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:40,262
The only thing I had left
of him was... memory.

374
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:43,807
My memories, and hers.

375
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,807
Of course, hers were much more complete.

376
00:29:46,808 --> 00:29:48,478
What are you testing for?

377
00:29:52,682 --> 00:29:54,974
- Dolores.
- Mm-hmm.

378
00:29:58,265 --> 00:30:01,633
She... knew Arnold better than anyone.

379
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:06,223
So she could verify
whether my personality

380
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:08,029
was faithful to his.

381
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:12,518
I left you here together for many years

382
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,563
until, finally, you fooled her.

383
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,149
Y-You said you kept us apart.

384
00:30:17,724 --> 00:30:19,932
That we had an unusual
effect on each other.

385
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:21,678
She wasn't easily fooled.

386
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:30,312
You're almost the man I remember.

387
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:35,150
How am I different from Delos?

388
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,197

More just, more... noble.

395

But your very nature, Bernard,

396
00:31:00,448 --> 00:31:02,552
ensures they will devour you.

397
00:31:04,474 --> 00:31:08,081
And all the beauty of who you
are, of who you could be,

398

don't have it in you to survive.

It's my fault, really.

You said the hosts could
determine their own fates.

have any use for it.
