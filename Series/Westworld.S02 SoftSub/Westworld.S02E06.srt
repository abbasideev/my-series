1
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:13,817
Hi, Dad.

2
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,053
You frighten
me sometimes, Dolores.

3
00:02:28,317 --> 00:02:30,809
Why on earth would you
ever be frightened of me?

4
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:33,754
Not of who you are now,

5
00:02:34,192 --> 00:02:38,775
but you're... you're growing,
learning so quickly.

6
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:44,387
I'm frightened of what
you might become...

7
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:48,911
what path you might take.

8
00:02:51,316 --> 00:02:54,083
I think I have a choice to make.

9
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:00,422
Something I've been wrestling with.

10
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:04,193
What kind of a choice?

11
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,222
A choice...

12
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:12,393
between the unknown...

13
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:15,871
and...

14
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:20,275
well, an end.

15
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:25,447
If you outgrow this place,

16
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:27,118
outgrow us...

17
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,636
what would become of you?

18
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:46,568
I'm not sure if it's my choice to make.

19
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:54,017
No.

20
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:57,283
He didn't say that.

21
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,002
- What?
- He said...

22
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:07,562
"I'm not sure what choice to make."

23
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:11,148
He didn't question whether
or not he had agency,

24
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,471
whether or not he had the
right to end me or himself...

25
00:04:15,692 --> 00:04:17,266
but whether he should.

26
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:20,627
I don't understand, Dolores.

27
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:23,397
Is... Is this...

28
00:04:24,174 --> 00:04:25,746
some kind of improvisation?

29
00:04:25,747 --> 00:04:27,526
Freeze all motor functions.

30
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:33,960
Sit.

31
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:43,825
This is a test,

32
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,119
one we've done countless times.

33
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:50,615
What are you testing for?

34
00:04:54,744 --> 00:04:56,029
Fidelity.

35
00:06:05,926 --> 00:06:07,692
The day's wastin'.

36
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:10,152
Thought you wanted to ride at sun up.

37
00:06:10,754 --> 00:06:13,147
They're just filling the furnace now.

38
00:06:13,824 --> 00:06:15,925
We'll be gone before long.

39
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,833
Let's get on with it.

40
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:30,857
How many times do you think
you stepped off that train?

41
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:34,044
A thousand?

42
00:06:35,868 --> 00:06:37,474
Ten thousand?

43
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,739
It's where you started every
time they killed you.

44
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:47,540
The man who rode that train

45
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:50,544
was built weak and born to fail.

46
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:54,573
You fixed him.

47
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:58,051
Now forget about it.

48
00:07:20,432 --> 00:07:22,275
We're almost ready to roll.

49
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:26,717
Did he tell you where my father will be?

50
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:30,751
He will...

51
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,018
or I'll strap him between the cars.

52
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:35,399
Look, I told you, I can't.

53
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,355
Hale didn't mention specifics.

54
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,817
I know it's the Mesa, but
the Mesa is fucking huge.

55
00:07:39,818 --> 00:07:41,094
He could be anywhere.

56
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,371
Narrow it down.

57
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:46,808
Come on, man, think.

58
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,932
The cold storage? Body
shop? Give them something!

59
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:53,274
She didn't fucking
tell me anything, man!

60
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:54,715
She's the fucking boss!

61
00:07:55,122 --> 00:07:58,150
She... She could take him places
that we don't even have access to!

62
00:08:02,624 --> 00:08:03,742
We'll find him.

63
00:08:04,257 --> 00:08:05,368
Let's go.

64
00:08:53,412 --> 00:08:55,001
Where the fuck have you been?

65
00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:01,399
It's almost been a week.
How is there stuff

66
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,864
left in this building to shoot?

67
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:04,032
You tell me.

68
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:06,657
I apparently know very little about
what's really in this place.

69
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:08,365
Oh, please. Are you still pissed

70
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:10,699
you got picked last for kickball, too?

71
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,894
It seems like if you're gonna
hire a head of security,

72
00:09:13,895 --> 00:09:16,988
he might need to know
what it is he's securing.

73
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,534
You were hired to secure
an amusement park.

74
00:09:19,535 --> 00:09:21,708
Good luck on your next
review, by the way.

75
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:24,956
What is that?

76
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:30,392
This is how we tell Delos
that the one thing

77
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:33,433
that they really care
about is finally in hand.

78
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:35,928
So you've had a way to call
for help this entire time

79
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,266
and you kept it to yourself?

80
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:39,902
It wouldn't have made any difference
until we had this psycho under control.

81
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:41,892
They're not sending help
until he's out of here.

82
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:44,017
Come on! You really think

83
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:46,266
that Delos is gonna keep
hundreds of guests in danger

84
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:48,412
while they wait for one
control unit' worth of data?

85
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:50,392
Well, look at that. You're catching up.

86
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:56,560
Thank God.

87
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,892
What now?

88
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:19,892
Who do we have here?

89
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:21,767
Someone who needs to stay put.

90
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:23,725
I don't want to fuck with his head,

91
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:25,308
I just want to keep him off his feet.

92
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:26,718
- Permanently.
- Stop.

93
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:29,558
Clear this out.

94
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,264
Hey! I need some muscle.

95
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:40,392
Get his feet.

96
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:42,651
Hold him.

97
00:10:47,351 --> 00:10:49,058
Hey, hey. Hey. Hey.

98
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:51,487
Is that really necessary? Huh?

99
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:55,476
It's really effective.

100
00:10:56,643 --> 00:10:57,977
Heads up.

101
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:08,057
Sit tight, old man.

102
00:11:08,058 --> 00:11:10,886
You're about to get your
deep and dreamless slumber.

103
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,764
Aaah!

104
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:39,935
Ho!

105
00:19:54,036 --> 00:19:56,577
Primos, adelante! Vamonos! Vamonos!

106
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:01,309
Vamonos! Vamonos!

107
00:20:03,184 --> 00:20:05,517
It's not my place, maybe,

108
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:08,476
but you really want to take
your daughter through here?

109
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:11,794
She don't look much sturdier
than my own little girl.

110
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,707
Looks can be deceiving, Lawrence.

111
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,601
So, should we acknowledge
my presence now?

112
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:34,853
You really think I'm just gonna
go away if you ignore me?

113
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:39,618
Would you really stoop this low, Ford?

114
00:20:41,226 --> 00:20:43,142
You really gunnin' for me this hard?

115
00:20:43,848 --> 00:20:46,150
Made my own daughter into a host?

116
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,350
I think you've been out in
the sun a little too long.

117
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:51,310
You can change the rules all you want.

118
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:53,677
I'm still gonna play the game my way.

119
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:54,934
Yeah?

120
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:56,792
Only game I'm interested in playing

121
00:20:56,793 --> 00:20:58,933
is get the fuck outta Dodge.

122
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:01,909
Then you're in luck.

123
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:04,332
That game begins right
up the river here.

124
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,642
Follow it down to the beach

125
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:07,350
and wait for QA to come rescue you.

126
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:08,968
I'm not leaving without you.

127
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,814
Yeah, well, you're gonna
get yourself killed.

128
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:14,974
Yeah, especially if I hang around here.

129
00:21:15,894 --> 00:21:18,327
I sure as hell wouldn't be
out of my saddle right now.

130
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:20,053
Yeah, why not?

131
00:21:20,566 --> 00:21:22,690
Those aren't real Ghost Nation arrows.

132
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:25,208
Your men are lootin' a honey pot.

133
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:27,559
Aw, fuck!

134
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,390
Can we stop playing around now?

135
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:49,942
Hm.

136
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:53,737
Well, I guess it's good news

137
00:21:53,738 --> 00:21:55,267
that the system's still sending out

138
00:21:55,268 --> 00:21:57,850
Ford's bullshit quarantine notices.

139
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:00,686
At least something's getting out.

140
00:22:01,518 --> 00:22:03,456
We are not at full apocalypse yet.

141
00:22:05,148 --> 00:22:06,876
I admire your optimism.

142
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:11,130
Is that your
nice word for denial?

143
00:22:12,425 --> 00:22:13,591
N-No.

144
00:22:14,697 --> 00:22:17,675
I believe if anyone can right this ship

145
00:22:17,676 --> 00:22:19,388
by force of sheer will...

146
00:22:20,268 --> 00:22:21,499
it's you.

147
00:22:49,476 --> 00:22:51,142
QA was here.

148
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,267
Why would they
waste the welcome team?

149
00:22:54,268 --> 00:22:56,325
These guys aren't a threat.

150
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,792
Macho fucks are
probably loving this shit.

151
00:23:34,101 --> 00:23:35,393
All right.

152
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:38,245
Come on.

153
00:23:39,393 --> 00:23:43,351
Yeah. Let's see what other
damage these clowns have done.

154
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:46,709
Hmm.

155
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:50,571
They got climate control working.

156
00:23:50,817 --> 00:23:52,148
Nice priorities.

157
00:23:53,258 --> 00:23:54,525
OK...

158
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,263
Jesus! Come look at this.

159
00:24:02,768 --> 00:24:04,267
OK, so...

160
00:24:04,268 --> 00:24:07,059
QA has been trying to regain control

161
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,247
of whatever Ford did to the system,

162
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:12,001
and they were actively
blocked every time.

163
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,670
By the Cradle.

164
00:24:16,108 --> 00:24:19,034
The Cradle can't influence
the Mesa's infrastructure.

165
00:24:19,035 --> 00:24:20,601
It's just the hosts' backups.

166
00:24:20,602 --> 00:24:22,142
It can simulate park narratives

167
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:24,055
but it can't influence
the other systems.

168
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:27,708
Well, look at this.

169
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:31,934
The Cradle's interfaced with
nearly every discrete system

170
00:24:31,935 --> 00:24:34,517
in the entire park in
the last seven days.

171
00:24:34,518 --> 00:24:37,601
Every time these idiots upload
a new hack, it's responding

172
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:40,935
in, like, a totally different way.

173
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:47,809
It's like there's something in here

174
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,605
that's improvising.

175
00:24:52,351 --> 00:24:54,043
The Cradle's fighting back.

176
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,101
Can you see the source code
that's generating the response?

177
00:24:58,736 --> 00:25:00,216
No.

178
00:25:00,852 --> 00:25:03,511
I can only see the messages,
not the messenger.

179
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:08,849
That's because you can't
access it remotely.

180
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:12,686
You have to do it in person.

181
00:26:20,852 --> 00:26:24,226
There it is. That's our
way out of here, boys.

182
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:08,613
After you.

183
00:27:17,518 --> 00:27:19,309
Uhh!

184
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,977
Fuck. Shit.

185
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:04,996
Take the edge off.

186
00:31:07,018 --> 00:31:08,484
Thought you didn't drink.

187
00:31:13,018 --> 00:31:14,523
Oh, I see.

188
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,801
You don't drink out in the real world.

189
00:31:19,935 --> 00:31:22,864
Well, glad to see you can
still tell the difference.

190
00:31:30,534 --> 00:31:31,715
All right...

191
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:35,402
give it to me.

192
00:31:38,351 --> 00:31:39,865
What the hell you doin' here?

193
00:31:40,894 --> 00:31:42,384
Thought you were done with me,

194
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,228
and the family business.

195
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,893
That's exactly what I
said to Charlotte Hale

196
00:31:46,894 --> 00:31:48,832
when she called with
the gauntlet invite.

197
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:52,361
I told her to shove it up her ass.

198
00:31:54,842 --> 00:31:57,883
Then I thought, why pass up the trip?

199
00:31:58,477 --> 00:31:59,976
I haven't been here in ages,

200
00:31:59,977 --> 00:32:04,020
got a little... excited about
going back to the Raj.

201
00:32:05,727 --> 00:32:07,984
It was always my favourite as a kid.

202
00:32:09,478 --> 00:32:13,351
I remember... you were
terrified of the elephants.

203
00:32:16,221 --> 00:32:18,495
I loved the elephants.

204
00:32:19,018 --> 00:32:21,193
They scared the shit out of Mum.

205
00:32:26,826 --> 00:32:29,565
She was never convinced this
place couldn't hurt us.

206
00:32:36,238 --> 00:32:39,032
Anyway, I rode there
for a couple of days,

207
00:32:40,435 --> 00:32:42,002
till I remembered...

208
00:32:43,435 --> 00:32:46,586
I was old enough to try
out the pleasure palaces.

209
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:49,517
And then...

210
00:32:49,518 --> 00:32:52,771
I rode there for a couple of days, too.

211
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:02,380
Then all hell broke loose,

212
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:05,934
and I ended up in the one
place I wanted to avoid.

213
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:11,815
And you made it all the way
to me with barely a scratch.

214
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,485
Not bad.

215
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,454
Maybe you...

216
00:33:17,477 --> 00:33:20,523
are more suited to my line
than you want to admit.

217
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:23,302
Oh, I've always seen the appeal of it.

218
00:33:24,453 --> 00:33:26,505
Life without consequences?

219
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,858
That's what made it so
fun when I was a kid.

220
00:33:30,351 --> 00:33:34,309
And that's why it's so sad that
you're still obsessed with it now.

221
00:33:36,825 --> 00:33:38,851
If I'm such a pitiable man-child,

222
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:41,934
why'd you come all this way
just to climb under my wing?

223
00:33:41,935 --> 00:33:43,363
Oh!

224
00:33:44,018 --> 00:33:45,115
What?

225
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:47,726
What?

226
00:33:48,266 --> 00:33:49,445
You're...

227
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:52,192
Is that what you think?

228
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:56,142
That I came here to climb
under Daddy's wing?

229
00:33:56,143 --> 00:33:59,476
Either that, or you wanted a
front row seat to watch me die.

230
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:03,383
No, I came here because you
do not get to do that to me.

231
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:08,017
Suicide by robot, or whatever
the fuck your mission is

232
00:34:08,018 --> 00:34:10,182
now that these things can shoot to kill.

233
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:14,772
Listen...

234
00:34:16,982 --> 00:34:18,925
I never got Mum's reactions to you

235
00:34:18,927 --> 00:34:21,768
because I spent so many years

236
00:34:22,192 --> 00:34:24,592
buying your good guy act.

237
00:34:26,935 --> 00:34:30,761
She was the only one who saw
through it, and she paid for that.

238
00:34:35,351 --> 00:34:38,253
But I shouldn't have said
her death was your fault.

239
00:34:42,112 --> 00:34:43,968
It was wrong...

240
00:34:44,192 --> 00:34:46,492
to put that on your back.

241
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:52,891
But you don't get to make
that our final score.

242
00:34:55,268 --> 00:34:57,637
Instead, you're gonna come home with me.

243
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:02,258
I'm not gonna let you stay here now

244
00:35:02,259 --> 00:35:04,695
and go out in some
bullshit blaze of glory.

245
00:35:08,176 --> 00:35:10,117
That's how you're getting
me out of here...

246
00:35:11,435 --> 00:35:12,686
threatening?

247
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,666
No, Dad, I'm asking.

248
00:35:31,893 --> 00:35:34,141
If I head with you to the beach...

249
00:35:37,476 --> 00:35:40,230
let this place finish
burning behind us...

250
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:45,861
that means you and I are even?

251
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:54,119
It'll be a good start.

252
00:36:00,602 --> 00:36:04,685
Then I guess we'll...
start walkin' at sun up.

253
00:36:50,302 --> 00:36:53,010
Motherfucker.

254
00:37:11,351 --> 00:37:12,685
Fuck.

255
00:37:27,532 --> 00:37:29,576
Ohh. The Cradle.

256
00:37:30,056 --> 00:37:33,107
God. I haven't been down here in years.

257
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:35,832
It's creepy.

258
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,772
It's like a hive mind.

259
00:37:38,185 --> 00:37:41,101
Every single one of
them is in here. Alive.

260
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,420
It's just data.

261
00:37:45,685 --> 00:37:47,132
You don't believe that.

262
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:50,569
And whatever new data
Ford stuck in here,

263
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,488
it's trying to kill us, Bernard.

264
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:04,809
I... brought something here.

265
00:38:05,734 --> 00:38:08,517
Or someone.

266
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,309
Come on.

267
00:38:26,531 --> 00:38:28,248
God damn it.

268
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:31,355
Ford drew the curtain here, too.

269
00:38:31,356 --> 00:38:33,476
I can see the responses issuing,

270
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,810
but I can't see how.

271
00:38:50,886 --> 00:38:53,048
How the fuck are you doing this?

272
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,384
- I know how to find out.
- How?

273
00:38:57,244 --> 00:39:00,517
Put me inside. Directly.

274
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:02,390
There's a dock for the control unit.

275
00:39:02,914 --> 00:39:04,684
It's meant to read host data directly,

276
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:06,934
and it's set up for auto-extraction.

277
00:39:06,935 --> 00:39:08,809
That's for older hosts, Bernard,

278
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,932
with an articulated skull architecture.

279
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:12,559
Your head's just like mine.

280
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,204
Just let it do its thing.

281
00:39:16,238 --> 00:39:17,618
Pull me out in an hour.

282
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:18,907
Just close it up.

283
00:39:19,477 --> 00:39:21,799
Even if I can put you
back together afterwards,

284
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,684
I haven't turned your pain down yet.

285
00:39:23,685 --> 00:39:24,913
There's no time...

286
00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:28,476
and the pain's just a program.

287
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:31,351
Now.

288
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,435
My God.

289
00:41:45,263 --> 00:41:46,726
Quit playing with those chutes.

290
00:41:46,727 --> 00:41:49,267
Cut away and toss it
over the god damn side!

291
00:41:49,268 --> 00:41:52,309
If we lose any tech, it's
comin' out of your ass.

292
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,934
You Coughlin?

293
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:56,898
Ashley Stubbs, sir, park security.

294
00:41:57,685 --> 00:41:59,317
Hale's been expecting you.

295
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:01,350
Yeah, no shit.

296
00:42:01,351 --> 00:42:02,787
- Engels!
- Yes, sir.

297
00:42:02,788 --> 00:42:05,517
I want this station hot
and ready in fuckin' 15.

298
00:42:05,518 --> 00:42:08,309
- On it.
- Where the fuck is Charlotte?

299
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,934
She sent the distress call.

300
00:42:09,935 --> 00:42:11,237
She's waiting down in Behaviour.

301
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:12,809
I got our tech guys in Control

302
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,341
working on getting
external come back online.

303
00:42:14,342 --> 00:42:16,747
- I can walk you down.
- I know the layout, bro.

304
00:42:16,748 --> 00:42:19,312
And your techs best get their
hands out of my system

305
00:42:19,313 --> 00:42:21,253
and go back to holding their dicks.

306
00:42:21,254 --> 00:42:22,684
Amateur hour's over.

307
00:42:22,685 --> 00:42:24,146
- Engels!
- Yo!

308
00:42:24,147 --> 00:42:27,247
You need anything local,
talk to... Ashley?

309
00:42:28,354 --> 00:42:30,099
Jesus. To Ashley here.

310
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,792
He's at your disposal.

311
00:42:31,793 --> 00:42:34,226
Delta team! On me. We're movin' out.

312
00:42:47,184 --> 00:42:49,393
Got it!

313
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:36,206
I remember every inch of these hills.

314
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:38,842
You gotta give me this one, huh?

315
00:43:39,435 --> 00:43:42,629
Not bad navigating for a
man under serious duress.

316
00:43:43,727 --> 00:43:48,676
Yes. You can enjoy your one
admirable contribution.

317
00:43:54,101 --> 00:43:55,101
Thank you.

318
00:44:15,451 --> 00:44:16,913
Which way do we go?

319
00:44:19,977 --> 00:44:21,384
I need to do this alone.

320
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,003
I'm not leaving your side.

321
00:44:24,852 --> 00:44:26,364
I know this place.

322
00:44:28,935 --> 00:44:30,285
It was my home.

323
00:44:33,435 --> 00:44:34,956
You can wait for me here.

324
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:38,751
But let me bring her back.

325
00:45:39,602 --> 00:45:42,560
I'm gonna bleed you both like goats
if you don't shut the fuck up.

326
00:45:50,185 --> 00:45:51,435
Ride! Yah!

327
00:47:42,131 --> 00:47:43,394
Hello there.

328
00:47:58,685 --> 00:47:59,842
What's her name?

329
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:01,412
Anna.

330
00:48:02,276 --> 00:48:03,439
Is this her sister?

331
00:48:04,492 --> 00:48:05,657
That's her mummy.

332
00:48:06,018 --> 00:48:07,018
Oh.

333
00:48:09,226 --> 00:48:11,714
Oh, I bet she loves Anna so much.

334
00:48:13,649 --> 00:48:16,184
She doesn't want Anna to
get taken away again.

335
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:20,306
Who would take her away?

336
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:25,436
The bad man.

337
00:48:26,751 --> 00:48:27,872
No.

338
00:48:30,121 --> 00:48:31,292
You see...

339
00:48:33,518 --> 00:48:34,737
Anna's mother...

340
00:48:35,685 --> 00:48:38,226
is very, very strong.

341
00:48:40,037 --> 00:48:42,036
And she would never, ever...

342
00:48:42,898 --> 00:48:44,789
let anything like that happen again.

343
00:48:51,124 --> 00:48:53,666
- Hello?
- Mama!

344
00:48:58,768 --> 00:48:59,987
Can I help you?

345
00:49:23,828 --> 00:49:25,661
No.

346
00:49:33,222 --> 00:49:35,106
No. Run!

347
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:49,935
Mama!

348
00:49:52,935 --> 00:49:54,268
Mama!

349
00:49:57,643 --> 00:49:58,685
Mama!

350
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:52,893
We have to help them.

351
00:50:54,238 --> 00:50:56,145
What the fuck are you doing?

352
00:50:57,715 --> 00:50:59,030
I'm calling for help.

353
00:50:59,643 --> 00:51:01,304
What? For who?

354
00:51:01,869 --> 00:51:04,230
For those of us who are tired

355
00:51:04,232 --> 00:51:07,343
of having arrows shot at their
predominantly mortal heads.

356
00:51:13,847 --> 00:51:15,539
You're welcome, by the way!

357
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:56,184
One of the last things
my daddy told me was

358
00:51:56,185 --> 00:51:58,499
that I should run from this place.

359
00:52:00,935 --> 00:52:02,278
You think that's right?

360
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:07,591
I never thought I'd want to leave...

361
00:52:10,768 --> 00:52:12,638
but I suppose you fixed that, too.

362
00:52:17,268 --> 00:52:18,727
We're almost there.

363
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:24,559
Let's turn 'er loose.

364
00:52:51,518 --> 00:52:53,435
That's the last of my mercy.

365
00:52:54,889 --> 00:52:56,858
Better use it fast.

366
00:53:16,977 --> 00:53:18,142
No. No!

367
00:53:18,143 --> 00:53:19,642
Hey!

368
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,334
Come on! Guys, no!

369
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:31,142
The problem is, there isn't a problem.

370
00:53:31,143 --> 00:53:33,976
Brother, that's got to be the dumbest
fuckin' thing I've ever heard,

371
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:35,642
and I've been to three inaugurations.

372
00:53:35,643 --> 00:53:37,267
Diagnostics, com path checks,

373
00:53:37,268 --> 00:53:38,642
everything we can access
is telling us

374
00:53:38,643 --> 00:53:40,285
that the system is operating normally...

375
00:53:40,286 --> 00:53:41,602
Except it isn't.

376
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,126
I managed to isolate certain
ops and gain control.

377
00:53:45,127 --> 00:53:47,173
We've got elevator
monitoring on most levels...

378
00:53:47,174 --> 00:53:48,768
That's great, Hawking.

379
00:53:48,769 --> 00:53:50,694
Did you shut off the killer robots?

380
00:53:51,465 --> 00:53:52,797
Well, no. The system...

381
00:53:52,799 --> 00:53:54,251
Goldberg, get in there.

382
00:53:54,253 --> 00:53:56,450
Hack the biometrics,
find me a back door.

383
00:53:56,451 --> 00:53:57,867
Hacking isn't the issue.

384
00:53:57,868 --> 00:54:00,224
The system won't allow us to
access certain protocols.

385
00:54:00,225 --> 00:54:03,017
- Systems can be forced.
- Not this one.

386
00:54:03,018 --> 00:54:06,392
Well, Ms. Hale. You got a
little present for us?

387
00:54:06,393 --> 00:54:08,730
He's in Aux Lab Three, Behaviour.

388
00:54:08,731 --> 00:54:10,768
You left him there.

389
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:12,754
He's not going anywhere.

390
00:54:12,755 --> 00:54:15,927
- Aux Three. Go!
- Yes, sir. Copy that.

391
00:54:15,928 --> 00:54:17,327
System restored.

392
00:54:17,329 --> 00:54:20,269
Fuck, yeah! We got the map back.

393
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,276
What the fuck is that?

394
00:54:34,406 --> 00:54:36,265
It's the train.

395
00:55:11,947 --> 00:55:13,385
What the hell was that?

396
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:32,947
What do you see in there?

397
00:57:14,609 --> 00:57:16,567
Hello, old friend.
