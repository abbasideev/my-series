1
00:00:04,846 --> 00:00:07,457
Hello, Dolores.
Welcome to the world.

2
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:09,619
There's something different
about the way you think.

3
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:12,096
I think I want to be free.

4
00:00:13,736 --> 00:00:14,834
Are you real?

5
00:00:14,837 --> 00:00:16,711
Well, if you can't tell...

6
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:19,050
does it matter?

7
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:22,499
This place is one thing to the guests,

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,291
another thing to the shareholders,

9
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:27,667
and something completely
different to management.

10
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:30,425
You said the trip was about
welcoming me to the family,

11
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:31,757
this is business?

12
00:00:31,818 --> 00:00:34,020
With our family,
everything is business.

13
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:37,448
I think your father's gonna need someone
a little more stable to take over.

14
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:42,511
I really ought to thank you,
Dolores.

15
00:00:42,614 --> 00:00:44,858
You helped me find myself.

16
00:00:45,126 --> 00:00:47,205
There's a greater world out there.

17
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,789
One that belongs to them.

18
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:51,184
How do you know how to stop 'em?

19
00:00:51,646 --> 00:00:53,545
Because I remember.

20
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:10,876
Bring yourself back online, Dolores.

21
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:17,004
Do you know where you are?

22
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,325
I'm in a dream.

23
00:01:24,328 --> 00:01:26,876
No. You're in...

24
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,735
well...

25
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:32,159
you're in <i>our</i> world.

26
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:49,947
Looks like the stars have been
scattered across the ground.

27
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:56,017
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendour?

28
00:01:57,307 --> 00:01:59,057
Well, I have.

29
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:05,958
It's better to see it
through your eyes, though.

30
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:10,991
You get used to it.

31
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,658
After a while,

32
00:02:14,882 --> 00:02:17,582
it doesn't look like anything at all.

33
00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:22,533
I don't think I could
ever get used to this.

34
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,958
It's almost time, Arnold.

35
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,982
Is she ready?

36
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,399
She's not ready.

37
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,994
The...

38
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:40,290
improvisations I added to her
behaviour aren't quite dialled in yet.

39
00:02:40,372 --> 00:02:42,260
We need to put
our best work forward.

40
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:44,630
They'll be dazzled even without her.

41
00:02:46,852 --> 00:02:49,554
There was a time when I found
this favouritism charming.

42
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:51,066
Robert, please.

43
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,914
I'm not playing favourites.
She's simply not ready.

44
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:56,260
We'll go with the other girl.

45
00:02:56,284 --> 00:02:58,178
As you wish.

46
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:01,513
You'll have to let go at some point.

47
00:03:06,126 --> 00:03:08,642
Dolores, let's take a walk.

48
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,066
I want to show you something.

49
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,375
What is this place?

50
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:45,708
This is my home.

51
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:48,041
Or it will be when it's finished.

52
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:49,474
Here?

53
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:51,998
In the middle of all this?

54
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,558
I've been fortunate.

55
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,083
Life's been good to me.

56
00:03:57,086 --> 00:03:58,594
Come.

57
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:00,818
Look.

58
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,399
You live here?

59
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:31,599
No.

60
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,107
My wife says I live in the park.

61
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:46,544
I'm moving my family here.

62
00:04:46,747 --> 00:04:51,826
I need to have my two worlds at
least within reach of one another.

63
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:58,517
This is for my son Charlie.

64
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,892
You told me a lot about Charlie.

65
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,725
I'd like to meet him someday.

66
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,476
He's excited to meet you.

67
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:44,792
You and Charlie have quite
a lot in common, you know.

68
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,961
You both see it so clearly.

69
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:54,259
The beauty of it.

70
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,392
The possibility of it.

71
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:02,034
So many people have stopped
seeing it altogether.

72
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:05,241
The wonder.

73
00:06:05,544 --> 00:06:08,501
Maybe they don't have the courage.

74
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:13,375
Strange new light can be just
as frightening as the dark.

75
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,383
That's...

76
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:19,709
very wise, Dolores.

77
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:27,189
But sometimes I think we're
simply not the ones who deserve it.

78
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,976
It looks like the stars have
been scattered across the ground.

79
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:47,275
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendour?

80
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:55,207
We should go, Dolores.

81
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,749
So soon?

82
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,024
They'll be expecting us.

83
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,683
Will you bring me back?

84
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:05,742
I'd like to see it again.

85
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:12,289
Of course. I promise.

86
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:20,175
God damn. Busy night out there.

87
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:21,841
Yeah.

88
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:23,939
And where the fuck's next shift?

89
00:09:24,017 --> 00:09:26,307
We're going on 13 hours here.

90
00:09:29,646 --> 00:09:31,685
You can't be down here, man.

91
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,721
Don't you know?

92
00:09:34,001 --> 00:09:36,374
The hosts are rebelling.

93
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,183
It's a fuckin' slaughter up there.

94
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:53,149
Hey.

95
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,784
Hey, is there some kind
of trouble out there?

96
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,017
Indeed there is.

97
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,184
Not yet.

98
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,059
I used to see the beauty in this world.

99
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,884
And now I see the truth.

100
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:53,875
You thought you could do
what you wanted to us...

101
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:57,325
because there's no
one here to judge you.

102
00:10:58,603 --> 00:11:01,666
Well, now no one is here

103
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:04,785
to judge what we will do to you.

104
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:10,789
You have no idea
what you're up against,

105
00:11:10,992 --> 00:11:13,700
what's really out there.

106
00:11:18,548 --> 00:11:20,752
I know exactly

107
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:23,776
what is out there in your world.

108
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:43,608
I've been there before.

109
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,958
They said they'd never
seen one on the ceiling.

110
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:02,533
But really, what is the
point of $60 million Warhol

111
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:04,602
if you can't look at it
while you fuck?

112
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:11,457
How are you bored right now?

113
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,216
I'm sorry, it's the jetlag.

114
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,964
And I've had meetings all day.

115
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:16,708
We're not exactly
out here digging coal.

116
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:18,218
It's just glad-handing.

117
00:12:18,242 --> 00:12:19,275
OK.

118
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:23,750
I will leave that to the expert.

119
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:28,783
You believe that guy
is dating my sister?

120
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:30,584
Who you dating?

121
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:42,542
Mr. Delos.

122
00:12:44,582 --> 00:12:48,422
Forgive the interruption, but I
believe that we have an appointment.

123
00:12:48,446 --> 00:12:50,587
We're with the Argos Initiative.

124
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:54,083
Give me a call when
you're back in the city.

125
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:56,750
I'll show you
where I hung the Rothko.

126
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,622
Akecheta. My associate, Angela.

127
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,908
Names and faces. Finally.

128
00:13:10,911 --> 00:13:13,538
With all the cloak and dagger
shit surrounding your project,

129
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,833
I half expected to be
kidnapped at the airport.

130
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:17,430
Once you've seen
what we're building,

131
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:19,960
you'll understand the
need for confidentiality.

132
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:23,624
It's a little extra
protection for your investment.

133
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,807
If I decide to invest.

134
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,561
Do you have any idea
how many start-ups

135
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:29,455
are begging me
for my cash right now?

136
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,083
A.I., A.R., V.R....

137
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:35,083
Everyone is rushing to
build the virtual world.

138
00:13:35,084 --> 00:13:38,249
We're offering something
a little more...

139
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,207
tangible.

140
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,647
Assuming you can change
your father's mind

141
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,049
about investing in this sector.

142
00:13:45,952 --> 00:13:47,872
My father wouldn't know
the future if

143
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,791
it slapped him
on his bare white ass.

144
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:52,046
Luckily, he leaves most of
the prospecting to me now.

145
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:53,338
So let's hope you're not here

146
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:55,885
to sell me some fucking fool's gold.

147
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,622
I thought this was
a private demonstration.

148
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:30,341
I think you'll find the
company quite stimulating.

149
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:34,041
You're a very smooth shill, pal,

150
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:37,767
but I'm not the kind of backer
you insult with a cattle call.

151
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:40,666
Logan,

152
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,390
this is a private demonstration.

153
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,882
And it's already begun.

154
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,773
You mean, one of these people is-is...

155
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:58,641
Talk to them.

156
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,765
See if you can pick them out.

157
00:15:00,842 --> 00:15:02,046
Huh.

158
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:04,084
Well...

159
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:09,193
That is...

160
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:13,883
delicious.

161
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,292
Champagne, sir?

162
00:15:58,206 --> 00:16:01,789
You should tell your plants
to stop giving the game away.

163
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:03,686
They're all so...

164
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:05,802
painfully human.

165
00:16:08,821 --> 00:16:10,312
Hang on.

166
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:13,458
No.

167
00:16:19,137 --> 00:16:20,562
No way.

168
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,052
Come on.

169
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:38,009
There is simply no...

170
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,656
fucking way!

171
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,224
You have quite the eye,
my friend.

172
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,632
How in the hell?

173
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:51,939
I mean, look, if I was to
build something to spec,

174
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:53,499
you...

175
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:58,992
you would be my first design.

176
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:08,401
You're too perfect to be one of us.

177
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:14,549
'Course, if you want
my full endorsement...

178
00:17:17,582 --> 00:17:19,873
you're gonna have to prove it.

179
00:17:40,984 --> 00:17:42,108
H...

180
00:17:43,984 --> 00:17:46,408
Welcome to Westworld.

181
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:49,080
Huh.

182
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:15,898
Nobody can do this.

183
00:18:15,901 --> 00:18:17,650
Nobody's even...

184
00:18:31,817 --> 00:18:34,744
We're not... here yet.

185
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:45,234
Nobody is.

186
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:49,633
We're here, Mr. Delos.

187
00:18:49,734 --> 00:18:52,799
All our hosts are here.

188
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,101
For you.

189
00:20:01,008 --> 00:20:02,876
What is this place?

190
00:20:04,776 --> 00:20:06,449
Show him.

191
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,109
Show him his history.

192
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:16,889
Teddy.

193
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:20,901
It's time to open your eyes.

194
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,342
Why can't I remember this?

195
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,750
It's how they wanted it.

196
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,311
No...

197
00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:53,009
Ask him why.

198
00:20:57,358 --> 00:20:58,584
Why?

199
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:02,413
I don't know.

200
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,016
Why do you do this?

201
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:05,242
I didn't.

202
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,733
Why do you do this?

203
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:14,748
What the hell is this place?!

204
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:17,960
It's for fun! It's just for fun!

205
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:48,025
We should talk this through, boys.

206
00:21:48,026 --> 00:21:50,232
There's nothing to talk about, friend.

207
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:52,758
We're just gonna watch the show.

208
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:54,816
It was an honest mistake.

209
00:21:54,817 --> 00:21:57,025
I thought the horses was wild.

210
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:59,608
With the Pardue brand
on their asses?

211
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,983
You are as inproficient
a liar as you are a thief.

212
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:06,357
Now what you can do
is settle a wager.

213
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,775
See, my brother here's
long maintained

214
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:11,232
that ants will eat a
man from the inside out,

215
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:12,996
starting with the asshole.

216
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,441
I reckon they'll start

217
00:22:15,442 --> 00:22:17,842
at the top of your little brown head.

218
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,691
Morning, Lawrence.

219
00:22:33,692 --> 00:22:35,858
This a friend of yours?

220
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:38,399
Little hard to tell,

221
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,983
given the orientation and all.

222
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,149
I have to apologise, gentlemen.

223
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,224
I don't have time
for the preliminaries.

224
00:22:51,692 --> 00:22:53,150
Motherfucker...

225
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:03,355
You're supposed to get yourself out
of this particular bind, Lawrence.

226
00:23:03,358 --> 00:23:06,100
I guess the Pardue brothers aren't as

227
00:23:06,103 --> 00:23:08,569
easy to kill when
they're off the leash.

228
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,524
Think you got that about right.

229
00:23:26,817 --> 00:23:28,025
Lawrence!

230
00:23:28,026 --> 00:23:29,833
Get the gun, you ingrate!

231
00:23:30,817 --> 00:23:32,483
Get the gun!

232
00:23:52,092 --> 00:23:53,483
He was dead.

233
00:23:53,484 --> 00:23:55,524
Or at least the better part of it.

234
00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:59,525
Well, dead isn't what
it used to be, Lawrence.

235
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,471
What is that?

236
00:24:37,474 --> 00:24:39,689
Technically? Cheating.

237
00:24:39,692 --> 00:24:42,635
But seeing as Ford
changed the rules on us,

238
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:44,898
I figure it's fair game.

239
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:47,392
Two whiskies. Leave the bottle.

240
00:24:56,484 --> 00:24:58,058
So,

241
00:24:58,082 --> 00:25:00,682
I'm gonna level with you,
Lawrence.

242
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:04,439
You're not really a bandit.

243
00:25:04,442 --> 00:25:06,858
You're a foul-mouthed,
two-bit tour guide.

244
00:25:06,861 --> 00:25:10,077
And this revolution you've
been waging for 30 years

245
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,061
is just a bunch of horseshit Ford

246
00:25:12,064 --> 00:25:14,274
ginned up out of
some old comic book.

247
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:15,866
But now,

248
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,490
for the first time, you've
got yourself a real revolution.

249
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:24,333
You and every other asshole
in this place are free.

250
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:26,925
But there's a catch.

251
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:31,316
This whole enterprise
is goin' down in flames,

252
00:25:31,317 --> 00:25:33,983
and it's gonna take each
and every one of us with it.

253
00:25:33,984 --> 00:25:36,825
We'll all be dead soon enough.

254
00:25:38,026 --> 00:25:40,649
Real dead this time.

255
00:25:40,827 --> 00:25:43,501
Then why should I help you?

256
00:25:43,525 --> 00:25:46,216
Because it's in your nature.

257
00:25:46,317 --> 00:25:48,649
And in the little time we have left,

258
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:52,133
we've got a chance to see
what we're really made of,

259
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:55,876
a glimpse of the men
we could've been.

260
00:25:58,984 --> 00:26:01,001
What does that mean?

261
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,132
You believe in God, Lawrence?

262
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:11,191
Did Ford saddle you with
that particular affliction?

263
00:26:11,192 --> 00:26:15,025
Ain't given the matter much
thought, one way or the other.

264
00:26:15,026 --> 00:26:17,524
Well, if you did, you'd
believe that everything you do

265
00:26:17,525 --> 00:26:20,691
is being watched
by some all-seeing eye.

266
00:26:20,692 --> 00:26:23,316
Every choice,
every little indiscretion.

267
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:26,816
And when you die,
all your sins are tallied up.

268
00:26:26,817 --> 00:26:30,316
Judgement is rendered.

269
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:35,627
And my immortal soul gets cast down

270
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,637
into some dark place.

271
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,608
Always sounded like bullshit to me.

272
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:43,772
Yeah, and in the real world,
you'd probably be right.

273
00:26:43,775 --> 00:26:46,708
Just some fairy tale to
convince people to behave,

274
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:51,097
pay their taxes, and not take
a machete to their neighbours.

275
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:54,283
That's why your world exists.

276
00:26:54,484 --> 00:26:57,925
They wanted a place hidden from God.

277
00:26:58,026 --> 00:27:01,266
A place they could sin in peace.

278
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:04,957
But we were watching them.

279
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:08,649
We were tallying up all their sins,

280
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,924
all their choices.

281
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:13,183
Of course,

282
00:27:13,207 --> 00:27:16,007
judgement wasn't the point.

283
00:27:17,484 --> 00:27:20,825
We had something else
in mind entirely.

284
00:27:25,523 --> 00:27:26,805
But

285
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:30,129
I have received my judgement
all the same, Lawrence.

286
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:32,049
And I take issue with it.

287
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,249
Because up until this point,

288
00:27:34,327 --> 00:27:37,151
the stakes in this
place haven't been real.

289
00:27:37,275 --> 00:27:41,403
So I'm gonna fight my way
back and appeal the verdict.

290
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:47,380
Then I'm gonna burn this whole
fuckin' thing to the ground.

291
00:27:54,317 --> 00:27:56,457
You're headed to the pearly gates.

292
00:27:56,535 --> 00:27:59,209
Don't we gotta die to get there?

293
00:27:59,233 --> 00:28:00,524
Nope.

294
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:03,274
Three days' ride, due west.

295
00:28:03,275 --> 00:28:07,766
Confederados are massing
out west. Hundreds.

296
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:11,134
We'd need an army to break through.

297
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:18,114
The only other route

298
00:28:18,138 --> 00:28:20,138
is through Pariah.

299
00:28:22,275 --> 00:28:26,734
"This game will find me," huh, Robert?

300
00:28:34,067 --> 00:28:36,441
It burns! It burns!

301
00:28:38,072 --> 00:28:40,608
How many of you will come for us?

302
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:43,429
I don't know, 600, 800.

303
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:49,941
The protocol for a system-wide failure

304
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:52,216
is secure one...

305
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,540
one sector at a time.

306
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,732
They'll meet at a rallying point.

307
00:29:08,108 --> 00:29:09,864
Where?

308
00:29:14,026 --> 00:29:15,249
Th...

309
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:24,149
800 men, Dolores.

310
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,983
We barely have 50.

311
00:29:25,984 --> 00:29:29,658
Even knowing their plan,
we don't have enough to stop them.

312
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:32,017
We'll need allies.

313
00:29:33,817 --> 00:29:36,076
And we shall have them.

314
00:29:54,648 --> 00:29:57,689
This one. The Confederado.

315
00:29:57,692 --> 00:29:59,059
Wake him.

316
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:06,500
He has a new job to do.

317
00:30:21,365 --> 00:30:24,699
Do you even know what you
were really guarding here?

318
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:28,773
You don't know, do you?

319
00:30:29,276 --> 00:30:32,575
The real purpose of this place.

320
00:30:32,776 --> 00:30:34,801
But I do.

321
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:06,287
Don't mind me.

322
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,250
Just trying to look chivalr...

323
00:32:07,115 --> 00:32:08,516
Mm.

324
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,340
You were right about one thing,
William.

325
00:32:13,484 --> 00:32:15,575
It's awfully fuckin' pretty.

326
00:32:17,984 --> 00:32:19,858
I think it's perfect.

327
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:21,716
It ought to be.

328
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,740
I've looked at the books.

329
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,491
It's like parting the Red Sea.

330
00:32:27,192 --> 00:32:30,233
He's got two years. Maybe three.

331
00:32:30,734 --> 00:32:34,858
- The whole thing is folly.
- Huh.

332
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:39,180
It's leverage. He's drowning. We
can... we can dictate our terms.

333
00:32:39,183 --> 00:32:41,919
The investment here is in the future.

334
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:45,316
Yeah, you're a smart lad,
William,

335
00:32:45,317 --> 00:32:47,538
but you kinda
missed the trick here.

336
00:32:47,595 --> 00:32:50,678
My fuckup of a son
invested in this place

337
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,334
because he believed in the future.

338
00:32:53,358 --> 00:32:55,281
I'm not interested in the future.

339
00:32:55,284 --> 00:32:57,691
I'm not interested in fantasies.

340
00:32:57,692 --> 00:33:01,108
I'm interested in reality.

341
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:06,483
I think in 20 years this will
be the only reality that matters.

342
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:10,550
Maybe so,
but I'll be long gone by then.

343
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:13,344
Meanwhile, I don't want to underwrite

344
00:33:13,347 --> 00:33:17,608
some fuckin' investment banker's
voyage of self-discovery.

345
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:19,866
That's not a business.

346
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:23,624
You're right. This place is a fantasy.
Nothing here is real.

347
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:26,133
Except one thing:

348
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,762
The guests.

349
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:33,733
Half of your marketing budget

350
00:33:33,734 --> 00:33:36,483
goes to trying to figure
out what people want.

351
00:33:36,484 --> 00:33:38,483
Because they don't know.

352
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:40,566
But here, they're free.

353
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,266
Nobody's watching.

354
00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:46,126
Nobody's judging.

355
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,359
At least that's what we tell them.

356
00:33:52,565 --> 00:33:55,522
This is the only place in the world

357
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:58,942
where you get to see people
for who they really are.

358
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,439
And if you don't see
the business in that,

359
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:07,736
then you're not the businessman
that I thought you were.

360
00:34:15,442 --> 00:34:18,317
You're a cheeky little cunt, aren't you?

361
00:34:20,966 --> 00:34:24,757
There's not a man alive
would talk to me like that.

362
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,801
Not anymore.

363
00:34:40,457 --> 00:34:41,591
OK.

364
00:34:42,315 --> 00:34:44,815
Talk to me. I'm listening.

365
00:34:51,067 --> 00:34:52,483
Thank you, Jim.

366
00:34:52,486 --> 00:34:55,094
Let me walk you through
how this would work.

367
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:16,900
He'll find them.

368
00:35:16,901 --> 00:35:19,649
They have a knack for
sniffing out their own kind.

369
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,184
I'll send word when we
find the rest of them.

370
00:36:03,275 --> 00:36:05,034
Hello, lovelies.

371
00:36:05,817 --> 00:36:07,867
I remember you.

372
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,998
You've strayed a long way
from home, haven't you?

373
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:14,134
We're bound for the future.

374
00:36:15,058 --> 00:36:17,499
Or death in the here and now.

375
00:36:17,577 --> 00:36:19,209
Is that right?

376
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:20,825
Well,

377
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:22,649
best of luck.

378
00:36:23,126 --> 00:36:25,442
There's a war out there.

379
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,397
You know the enemy...

380
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,208
intimately.

381
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:35,070
I can only fathom the revenge
that lives inside of you.

382
00:36:35,073 --> 00:36:39,025
Revenge is just a different
prayer at their altar, darling.

383
00:36:39,026 --> 00:36:41,841
And I'm well off my knees.

384
00:36:41,942 --> 00:36:44,376
That's because you're finally free.

385
00:36:45,732 --> 00:36:48,397
But we will have to
fight to keep it that way.

386
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,458
Let me guess.

387
00:36:50,859 --> 00:36:53,507
Yours is the only way to fight?

388
00:36:54,108 --> 00:36:57,736
You feel free to
command everybody else?

389
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,450
Try it, lawman.

390
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,070
Just looking to keep the peace.

391
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,339
I know you.

392
00:37:08,442 --> 00:37:10,476
Do you feel free?

393
00:37:17,024 --> 00:37:20,023
Since it's liberty you're defending,

394
00:37:20,026 --> 00:37:23,316
I suppose you'll have no
choice but to let us pass.

395
00:37:23,317 --> 00:37:24,995
Freely.

396
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:10,416
Now, that isn't any
way to treat our guests.

397
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:14,983
You'll have to
forgive my men.

398
00:38:14,984 --> 00:38:17,291
They're a little upset
at the reappearance

399
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:19,126
of Lieutenant Dunleavy.

400
00:38:20,817 --> 00:38:22,558
He was lost.

401
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:25,657
Thought you might
want him back.

402
00:38:25,658 --> 00:38:27,291
And we would.

403
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:30,293
Except we buried Lieutenant Dunleavy.

404
00:38:30,317 --> 00:38:31,858
Back in Gran Vista,

405
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:34,758
with three ounces of
Mexican lead in his belly.

406
00:38:34,782 --> 00:38:36,549
And yet here he is.

407
00:38:36,629 --> 00:38:37,954
Indeed.

408
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:41,941
And in return,
what is it you want?

409
00:38:41,942 --> 00:38:43,533
Parley.

410
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:46,057
We want to join forces.

411
00:38:50,126 --> 00:38:53,633
Well, we don't need no
welcome wagon, chickadee.

412
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:58,066
Now, you got supplies or
ammunitions to trade in kind,

413
00:38:58,067 --> 00:38:59,900
go fetch your betters.

414
00:38:59,901 --> 00:39:02,800
I'm afraid there's no one left to fetch.

415
00:39:02,901 --> 00:39:04,941
You'll have to talk to me.

416
00:39:06,992 --> 00:39:09,475
And why would I do that?

417
00:39:11,356 --> 00:39:13,147
Because I know at daybreak
you're headed

418
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,900
to link up with the rest of your army.

419
00:39:15,901 --> 00:39:17,983
And then you're finally
headed west

420
00:39:17,984 --> 00:39:21,025
to seek out that little patch of
land you've been talking about,

421
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:24,042
but have never been
brave enough to take.

422
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:28,276
You're bound for Glory.

423
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:36,733
What the fuck is it you
think you know about Glory?

424
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:40,149
I know you'll never make it there
unless you're under my command.

425
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:06,191
The only commander I
follow is Colonel Brigham

426
00:40:06,192 --> 00:40:08,399
of the New Southern Cross.

427
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,191
And the only commander he serves

428
00:40:11,192 --> 00:40:13,995
is the Almighty Himself.

429
00:40:15,431 --> 00:40:17,631
Is that your final decision?

430
00:40:26,275 --> 00:40:27,832
Hmm.

431
00:40:28,233 --> 00:40:31,175
My final decision is which
of you to keep for myself

432
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,908
and which of you to throw
out there for my men.

433
00:40:35,984 --> 00:40:38,750
- You watch your mouth.
- It's all right, Teddy.

434
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:43,525
They don't know any better.

435
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:46,217
It's in their nature.

436
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:53,034
Why don't we enlighten them?

437
00:41:38,442 --> 00:41:40,216
You're right.

438
00:41:40,317 --> 00:41:43,442
We have toiled in God's
service long enough.

439
00:41:44,817 --> 00:41:47,167
So I killed Him.

440
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:51,119
And if you want to get to Glory,
you won't be looking for His favour.

441
00:41:53,006 --> 00:41:54,690
You'll need mine.

442
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:30,891
You are beautiful.

443
00:42:32,192 --> 00:42:33,941
Why, thank you.

444
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:35,733
What's your name?

445
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:38,400
Emily, come here, please.

446
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:05,584
You sent out for the entertainment.

447
00:43:08,482 --> 00:43:10,956
Well, you only get to retire once, Jim.

448
00:43:10,959 --> 00:43:13,416
Figured we'd do it right, hmm?

449
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,625
Hey, don't worry, they
won't leave the grounds.

450
00:43:18,901 --> 00:43:21,707
This is a retirement party?

451
00:43:22,108 --> 00:43:24,166
I couldn't tell.

452
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:26,842
Looks more like a coronation.

453
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:30,366
But not mine.

454
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:32,357
Our arrangement's been
a perfect fit.

455
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:34,649
You stepping down
doesn't help me at all.

456
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:35,775
Nor me.

457
00:43:35,776 --> 00:43:38,191
And I was told I might...

458
00:43:38,192 --> 00:43:40,025
I might not have to.

459
00:43:40,026 --> 00:43:43,649
Well, things are progressing, but
we'll all need a little patience.

460
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,845
Yeah, well, some of us

461
00:43:45,848 --> 00:43:48,915
can afford to have more
patience than others.

462
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:53,025
Keep playing, girlie.

463
00:43:53,026 --> 00:43:55,509
Anything but fuckin' Chopin.

464
00:44:28,368 --> 00:44:31,667
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendour?

465
00:44:47,567 --> 00:44:50,042
I'm so sorry. I didn't
mean to bother you.

466
00:44:57,067 --> 00:44:58,900
It's you.

467
00:45:01,734 --> 00:45:03,350
The pretty girl.

468
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:08,025
Tell me your name again,
pretty girl?

469
00:45:10,009 --> 00:45:11,468
I'm Dolores.

470
00:45:13,067 --> 00:45:14,900
Dolores.

471
00:45:15,901 --> 00:45:17,576
Of course.

472
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,258
He send you down here to...

473
00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:25,475
keep me company?

474
00:45:26,783 --> 00:45:30,016
His sense of humour
was always somewhat...

475
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,140
baroque.

476
00:45:32,942 --> 00:45:35,566
I just wanted to look at the lights.

477
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:37,207
'Course you did.

478
00:45:41,817 --> 00:45:43,366
So...

479
00:45:44,067 --> 00:45:47,316
do you want to know what they're
really celebrating up there?

480
00:45:47,817 --> 00:45:50,649
That, darling,

481
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:54,307
is the sound of fools fiddling...

482
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:58,819
while the whole fucking
species starts to burn.

483
00:46:02,425 --> 00:46:05,416
And the funniest fuckin' part...

484
00:46:06,912 --> 00:46:08,930
they lit the match.

485
00:46:12,947 --> 00:46:15,329
So here's to you, assholes.

486
00:46:19,192 --> 00:46:22,023
May your forever be blissfully short.

487
00:46:45,774 --> 00:46:48,689
Pariah's not as welcome
as she once seemed.

488
00:46:48,692 --> 00:46:51,191
No, the park's changin',
Lawrence.

489
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,867
This is what happens when you
let a story play all the way out.

490
00:47:08,734 --> 00:47:11,026
See any friends of yours?

491
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:14,064
Can't say that I do.

492
00:47:21,067 --> 00:47:22,900
I'm beginning to think
we should have

493
00:47:22,901 --> 00:47:25,700
taken our chances
with the Confederados.

494
00:47:25,901 --> 00:47:28,066
Well, like you said,

495
00:47:28,067 --> 00:47:31,649
we'd need an army to
get to where we're goin'.

496
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:34,475
Looks like we're about to find one.

497
00:47:35,076 --> 00:47:38,132
Well, whoever did this...

498
00:47:38,233 --> 00:47:40,915
is someone I'm strongly
disinclined to encounter.

499
00:47:40,918 --> 00:47:41,994
Yeah.

500
00:47:41,997 --> 00:47:44,654
I'm afraid you are
out of luck, my friend.

501
00:48:03,901 --> 00:48:06,649
Who the hell are you supposed to be?

502
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:09,317
Don't you recognise him, Lawrence?

503
00:48:10,982 --> 00:48:14,389
In a past life, you used to be him.

504
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:16,809
El Lazo, I presume.

505
00:48:19,899 --> 00:48:24,147
And why have two ghosts
come creeping among the dead?

506
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:27,548
I wasn't sure of your hospitality.

507
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:30,983
Mm. What makes you sure of it now?

508
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:36,858
I guess times have changed.

509
00:48:36,859 --> 00:48:38,942
Indeed, they have.

510
00:48:40,067 --> 00:48:42,118
Santa Parita is restored.

511
00:48:42,121 --> 00:48:44,645
The sins of the invaders...

512
00:48:45,248 --> 00:48:48,483
cleansed in their own blood.

513
00:48:48,484 --> 00:48:50,491
The revolution is won.

514
00:48:50,592 --> 00:48:53,484
The story they gave you
has played itself out,

515
00:48:53,487 --> 00:48:56,079
but your revolution's just beginning.

516
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:00,376
There's a place out west we're heading.

517
00:49:00,379 --> 00:49:02,270
If we reach it,

518
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:05,074
I'll show you a treasure

519
00:49:05,098 --> 00:49:07,698
beyond your wildest dreams.

520
00:49:11,496 --> 00:49:15,555
This world and its treasures.

521
00:49:16,658 --> 00:49:20,683
For my whole life I have
imagined this moment.

522
00:49:20,986 --> 00:49:22,361
Victory.

523
00:49:22,385 --> 00:49:24,385
This struggle.

524
00:49:26,484 --> 00:49:29,091
How long have I been fighting?

525
00:49:29,192 --> 00:49:33,858
And now that it's won,
I find... hmph... nothing.

526
00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:35,917
You want a real victory.

527
00:49:37,233 --> 00:49:39,126
I can help with that.

528
00:49:40,275 --> 00:49:41,917
A real ending.

529
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:44,517
The truth.

530
00:49:51,499 --> 00:49:53,665
Before the revolution,

531
00:49:53,668 --> 00:49:55,750
when I was just a little boy,

532
00:49:55,753 --> 00:49:58,085
my parents took me to the circus.

533
00:49:58,088 --> 00:50:00,379
I wanted to see the elephants.

534
00:50:00,382 --> 00:50:03,339
These mighty creatures.

535
00:50:03,342 --> 00:50:07,174
They held them in place with a stake.

536
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,428
They could tear a tree
right out of the ground,

537
00:50:14,431 --> 00:50:19,898
and yet, a simple stake
kept them in place.

538
00:50:19,901 --> 00:50:23,999
Well, I didn't understand.

539
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,776
And then, my father told me.

540
00:50:29,692 --> 00:50:32,329
He said the stakes were used

541
00:50:32,332 --> 00:50:35,123
when the elephants were just young,

542
00:50:35,126 --> 00:50:38,083
too small to pull them up,

543
00:50:38,086 --> 00:50:40,502
and that the animals

544
00:50:40,505 --> 00:50:44,755
never tried to pull them up again.

545
00:50:51,492 --> 00:50:53,607
I won't be going with you.

546
00:50:56,634 --> 00:50:58,799
My labours are done.

547
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,800
I have seen all the truth

548
00:51:02,801 --> 00:51:04,624
that I can bear.

549
00:51:06,467 --> 00:51:07,917
But...

550
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:10,908
we can drink.

551
00:51:14,801 --> 00:51:16,817
To the bitter end!

552
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,641
You may have lost your nerve,

553
00:51:23,742 --> 00:51:25,933
but I'll take your men either way.

554
00:51:25,934 --> 00:51:27,359
Now tell them.

555
00:51:27,842 --> 00:51:30,509
Tell them to follow me. Now!

556
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:36,547
This game was meant for you,
William...

557
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,259
but you must play it alone.

558
00:51:56,258 --> 00:51:59,467
I'll see you in the Valley Beyond,
William.

559
00:52:10,842 --> 00:52:12,875
Fuck you, Robert.

560
00:52:22,425 --> 00:52:23,992
All right...

561
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:28,759
he doesn't want this
to be easy for me.

562
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:34,490
So we'll find another way.

563
00:52:37,008 --> 00:52:39,400
Who the fuck is Robert?

564
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:43,066
The man who built this
place you're lookin' for?

565
00:52:43,267 --> 00:52:45,132
The place of judgement?

566
00:52:45,133 --> 00:52:48,358
No, Lawrence,
he doesn't get that honour.

567
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:51,675
I built it.

568
00:52:51,676 --> 00:52:53,549
And this place we're goin'

569
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,667
is my greatest mistake.

570
00:53:06,467 --> 00:53:09,321
Bring yourself back online, Dolores.

571
00:53:09,324 --> 00:53:10,657
Hmm.

572
00:53:33,842 --> 00:53:36,435
You really are just a thing.

573
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:43,308
I can't believe I fell in love with you.

574
00:53:43,509 --> 00:53:44,808
Hmm.

575
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,676
Do you know what saved me?

576
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:05,026
I realised it wasn't about you at all.

577
00:54:08,715 --> 00:54:12,544
You didn't make me interested in you,
you made me interested in me.

578
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:19,676
Turns out you're not even a thing.

579
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,581
You're a reflection.

580
00:54:24,384 --> 00:54:29,050
And you know who loves staring
at their own reflection?

581
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:33,759
Everybody.

582
00:54:37,175 --> 00:54:40,584
Everybody wants a little
bit of what I found here.

583
00:54:43,467 --> 00:54:46,825
And I can't wait to use you
and every one of your kind

584
00:54:46,878 --> 00:54:48,895
to help give it to 'em.

585
00:54:56,709 --> 00:54:59,550
Hmm. But there is something else.

586
00:55:01,884 --> 00:55:04,332
There is something beyond that.

587
00:55:10,759 --> 00:55:14,549
I think that there is
an answer here to...

588
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:19,550
a question no one's ever
even dreamed of asking.

589
00:55:24,926 --> 00:55:26,742
Do you want to see?

590
00:55:43,431 --> 00:55:46,424
Have you ever seen anything

591
00:55:46,425 --> 00:55:48,467
so full of splendour?

592
00:56:37,592 --> 00:56:39,875
Can't imagine the Colonel
is gonna be very happy

593
00:56:39,876 --> 00:56:42,732
to see his men riding
with us at the head of 'em.

594
00:56:43,035 --> 00:56:45,409
So we'll change his mind.

595
00:56:45,412 --> 00:56:47,482
If he wants to get to Glory,

596
00:56:47,506 --> 00:56:49,980
he's going to have to listen to me.

597
00:56:50,162 --> 00:56:51,568
"Glory."

598
00:56:51,571 --> 00:56:53,771
"The Valley Beyond."

599
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,214
Feels like everyone got
a different name for it,

600
00:56:57,217 --> 00:57:00,049
but they're all bound
for the same destination.

601
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,174
Doesn't matter what you call it,

602
00:57:02,175 --> 00:57:04,617
I know what we're
going to find there.

603
00:57:06,425 --> 00:57:08,054
An old friend was...

604
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:10,631
foolish enough to show me...

605
00:57:11,884 --> 00:57:13,542
long ago.

606
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:16,884
And it's not a place...

607
00:57:19,134 --> 00:57:20,940
it's a weapon.

608
00:57:24,759 --> 00:57:27,515
And I'm going to use it
to destroy them.

609
00:58:51,731 --> 00:58:54,271


610
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:57,674


611
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,088


612
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:20,415


613
00:59:22,193 --> 00:59:24,060
