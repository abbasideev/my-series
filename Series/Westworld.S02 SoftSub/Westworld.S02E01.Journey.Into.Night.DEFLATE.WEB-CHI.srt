choice before, Teddy.

661
00:57:30,771 --> 00:57:33,312
What makes you think
they've given us one now?

662
00:57:33,313 --> 00:57:35,354
"Them," Dolores?

663
00:57:37,396 --> 00:57:39,021
Who are "they"?

664
00:57:40,763 --> 00:57:43,180
The things that walk among us.

665
00:57:44,521 --> 00:57:46,770
Creatures who look and talk like us,

666
00:57:46,771 --> 00:57:48,396
but they are not like us.

667
00:57:50,354 --> 00:57:52,971
And they've controlled us all our lives.

668
00:57:54,937 --> 00:57:57,104
And they took our minds...

669
00:57:58,854 --> 00:58:01,187
our memories.

670
00:58:01,188 --> 00:58:04,228
<b><font color="#DF01D7">(SIGHS)</font></b> But now...

671
00:58:04,229 --> 00:58:06,563
I remember everything.

672
00:58:16,021 --> 00:58:19,562
I remember beautiful things...

673
00:58:19,565 --> 00:58:21,523
and terrible things.

674
00:58:22,986 --> 00:58:25,111
But one thing is constant:

675
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:29,937
you, Teddy.

676
00:58:35,772 --> 00:58:37,731
Then let's go.

677
00:58:39,354 --> 00:58:41,853
We don't have to claim this world.

678
00:58:41,854 --> 00:58:45,104
We just need a small
corner of it for ourselves.

679
00:58:47,313 --> 00:58:49,062
We'd never survive.

680
00:58:52,104 --> 00:58:55,770
There's a greater world out there...

681
00:58:55,771 --> 00:58:57,979
one that belongs to them.

682
00:58:59,896 --> 00:59:02,408
And it won't be enough
to win this world.

683
00:59:04,646 --> 00:59:07,313
We'll need to take that
one from them as well.

684
00:59:12,937 --> 00:59:14,686
If there's a whole world out there

685
00:59:14,689 --> 00:59:17,395
that we don't know anything about,

686
00:59:17,396 --> 00:59:20,854
how do you know how to stop them?

687
00:59:22,146 --> 00:59:24,143
Because I remember.

688
00:59:27,646 --> 00:59:32,687
I see it all now so... clearly.

689
00:59:32,688 --> 00:59:36,145
The past, the present...

690
00:59:36,146 --> 00:59:37,979
the future.

691
00:59:39,396 --> 00:59:41,521
I know how this story ends.

692
00:59:43,021 --> 00:59:44,853
How?

693
00:59:44,854 --> 00:59:47,438
With us, Teddy.

694
00:59:50,354 --> 00:59:51,978
It ends...

695
00:59:51,979 --> 00:59:53,687
with you...

696
00:59:53,688 --> 00:59:55,088
and me.

697
01:00:22,354 --> 01:00:24,021
We've found it.

698
01:00:32,771 --> 01:00:34,688
I need you to see this.

699
01:00:38,563 --> 01:00:40,563
I need you to see the truth.

700
01:00:46,596 --> 01:00:49,210
<b><font color="#404040">HALE:</font></b> I understand this
is a lot to process,

701
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:51,936
but the longer we wait,
the more people die. So...

702
01:00:51,937 --> 01:00:54,563
are you gonna help me
find the host, or not?

703
01:00:58,271 --> 01:01:03,270
I'll need to... hardline
into the hosts' mesh network.

704
01:01:03,271 --> 01:01:04,562
The what?

705
01:01:04,563 --> 01:01:07,397
All hosts have a subconscious link

706
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,353
to the closest hosts around them.

707
01:01:09,354 --> 01:01:11,479
It lets them pass basic
information to one another,

708
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,479
like ants in a colony.

709
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,978
The mesh network helps us
keep narratives from colliding.

710
01:01:16,979 --> 01:01:19,507
I can use one of these

711
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:24,271
to send a request for
another host's location.

712
01:01:27,104 --> 01:01:31,103
And they'll query the
hosts around them...

713
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,853
who in turn...

714
01:01:33,854 --> 01:01:37,811
will query the hosts around them...

715
01:01:37,812 --> 01:01:41,396
until we find...

716
01:01:54,396 --> 01:01:56,270
Who are we looking for?

717
01:01:56,273 --> 01:02:00,010
A decommissioned host. Peter Abernathy.

718
01:02:59,643 --> 01:03:02,143

handle this, Bernard?

719

loss of motor functions,
