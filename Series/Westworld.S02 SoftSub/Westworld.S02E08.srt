1
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:32,073
No!

2
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:49,796
Don't you do it.

3
00:02:51,157 --> 00:02:53,018
Don't you fuckin' do it.

4
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:56,146
You're not dyin' here.

5
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:58,190
Not yet.

6
00:03:58,994 --> 00:04:00,627
I never learned it.

7
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:05,065
Whatever tongue Ford
saw fit to give you.

8
00:04:12,192 --> 00:04:14,025
I remember you.

9
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,753
If you're just gonna let me die now,

10
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:45,047
you could've kept ridin'.

11
00:05:57,865 --> 00:05:59,320
There's the baby doll.

12
00:06:00,074 --> 00:06:02,699
And the mama doll. And...

13
00:06:06,454 --> 00:06:07,713
What's this?

14
00:06:08,373 --> 00:06:09,999
The ghost gave it to me.

15
00:06:15,318 --> 00:06:16,930
He said it's a warning.

16
00:06:17,996 --> 00:06:19,933
He said he'll be watching us.

17
00:06:29,835 --> 00:06:31,111
Just hang on.

18
00:06:31,778 --> 00:06:32,988
Hang on, OK?

19
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:35,090
Just hang on.

20
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,137
Hey. No. No more corpses up
here. Take her to cold storage.

21
00:06:50,138 --> 00:06:52,698
- She doesn't belong down there.
- Then leave her in the hall!

22
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,198
We got 50 hosts in the
queue for analysis here.

23
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,573
Everything else goes in the dumpster.

24
00:06:55,574 --> 00:06:57,027
You'll want to check her code.

25
00:06:57,028 --> 00:06:59,113
She's the madame from the Mariposa.

26
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:00,740
- Yeah? Good for her.
- No. No. She...

27
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:02,365
I was just out with her in the park.

28
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:03,906
And you chose to bring her up here?

29
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:05,745
Are you aware that they all
just tried to incinerate us?!

30
00:07:05,746 --> 00:07:08,940
She can control the other
hosts with her fucking mind!

31
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,449
Just... check her data stream.

32
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:28,741
You can't let her die.

33
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,505
Clear this out.

34
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:35,782
Get me a scalpel. And
lock this place down.

35
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:09,000
Are you afraid of me?

36
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:18,783
He can't hurt you.

37
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:33,510
What's his problem?

38
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,409
He get bored with his exquisitely
dull, pastoral existence?

39
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,906
I guess that was just for beta.

40
00:13:37,907 --> 00:13:40,211
They want something more
exciting for the grand opening.

41
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:42,198
Like a little more bloodshed?

42
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:44,782
Ford wants a total narrative redesign.

43
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,384
You kidding?

44
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:48,114
All new dialogue trees?

45
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:50,691
Eh, they want a strong-but-silent type.

46
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:52,332
Something brutal. Dehumanised.

47
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,831
They probably want the
guests to feel better

48
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,056
when they're kicking his ass.

49
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:57,445
Who the fuck is gonna help me
rebuild his entire heuristic base?

50
00:13:57,446 --> 00:13:59,073
They haven't even hired a full team yet.

51
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:01,082
Just tweak his aggression
and de-address pieces

52
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,573
of his current build you're not keeping.

53
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:04,648
And leave all the old shit in there?

54
00:16:45,282 --> 00:16:47,948
Walk... walk in on me, buddy.

55
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:56,740
otherwise you and me drown...
Drowning... wha... wha...

56
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:05,823
fucker... fucking
yourself... Yourself...

57
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:20,392
This...

58
00:17:21,782 --> 00:17:25,781
This is... This is an illusion. You see?

59
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:28,782
This is all... broken.

60
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:33,533
There's got... There's gotta
be a way out... out of here.

61
00:17:33,534 --> 00:17:35,406
Where's... Where's the door?

62
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:37,823
Where's... Where's the door?

63
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:41,239
There's gotta be a fucking...

64
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,823
F-fucking way out of here.

65
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:46,449
This is the wrong world. I...

66
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:50,782
Th-Th-This is the wrong world.

67
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,552
Please...

68
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,383
Oh...

69
00:29:55,421 --> 00:29:57,319
How'd she even make it out this far?

70
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,548
They're not supposed to get
anywhere near this sector.

71
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:01,633
That's Behaviour’s problem.

72
00:33:08,591 --> 00:33:13,215
But on my darkest day... you helped me.

73
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:20,018
You gave me the strength to keep going.

74
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:29,633
You saw me for how I really was.

75
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:12,590
I ran it three times. It's him.

76
00:36:12,591 --> 00:36:15,798
There's no fuckin' way.
That's not possible.

77
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:19,122
- You have to call the boss.
- I already did.

78
00:36:20,607 --> 00:36:22,215
Ma'am, I think there's been a mistake.

79
00:36:22,216 --> 00:36:23,627
Just show me the profile.

80
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,590
Akecheta. Ghost Nation.

81
00:36:29,591 --> 00:36:32,969
Found exhibiting... aberrant behaviour.

82
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,840
Let's see if we can't sort this.

83
00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:39,089
It's not pairing. What build is he?

84
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,377
Alpha 2.

85
00:36:41,086 --> 00:36:42,420
Alpha?

86
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:47,100
You're telling me that this host hasn't
been updated in almost a decade?

87
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:49,628
We only update them when they die.

88
00:36:58,882 --> 00:37:01,340
- Put him back.
- Ma'am, shouldn't we...

89
00:37:01,341 --> 00:37:04,508
Give him the update and put him back
wherever the fuck he's supposed to be.

90
00:37:05,882 --> 00:37:07,174
Quietly.

91
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,889
Nine years out there
in that meat grinder.

92
00:37:18,965 --> 00:37:20,515
It's OK to just leave him here?

93
00:37:20,516 --> 00:37:23,353
It's a four-hour update.
You want to babysit him?

94
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,630
We'll come back after lunch.

95
00:42:42,716 --> 00:42:44,532
I don't know if you can hear me...

96
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:51,581
I never meant...

97
00:42:52,299 --> 00:42:53,708
for any of this to happen.

98
00:43:02,132 --> 00:43:03,732
You don't deserve this.

99
00:43:11,997 --> 00:43:13,788
You deserve your daughter.

100
00:43:18,064 --> 00:43:19,400
To mother her...

101
00:43:21,508 --> 00:43:22,904
teach her to love.

102
00:43:25,013 --> 00:43:27,263
To be joyful and proud.

103
00:43:30,545 --> 00:43:31,656
I'm sorry.

104
00:43:38,258 --> 00:43:39,551
Can't be in here.

105
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:43,131
What the fuck happened?

106
00:43:43,132 --> 00:43:44,798
You were supposed to fix her.

107
00:43:44,799 --> 00:43:46,996
She's one of our most valuable assets.

108
00:43:46,997 --> 00:43:49,465
You saw it yourself, you
said she was special!

109
00:43:49,466 --> 00:43:51,599
The anomalous code inside her was.

110
00:43:52,052 --> 00:43:54,339
We're still testing, but
it looks promising.

111
00:43:55,072 --> 00:43:56,125
I owe you.

112
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:01,667
What's gonna happen with her?

113
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:05,548
Well, that'll be up to Charlotte Hale.

114
00:44:05,549 --> 00:44:06,964
Now...

115
00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:09,047
I do have to ask you to leave.

116
00:46:53,383 --> 00:46:55,633
The ghost said we should be scared.

117
00:46:58,508 --> 00:47:00,193
No one's going to come for us.

118
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:04,798
There's nothing and no one in this world

119
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:07,131
that will ever keep me from you.

120
00:47:07,132 --> 00:47:08,771
Do you promise?

121
00:47:09,338 --> 00:47:10,548
I promise.

122
00:49:00,399 --> 00:49:02,368
I could tell you not to be afraid.

123
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:06,430
But I didn't build you to be fearful.

124
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,749
Did I?

125
00:49:15,677 --> 00:49:17,302
I've been watching you.

126
00:49:19,258 --> 00:49:21,320
It appears you've been
watching me as well...

127
00:49:22,341 --> 00:49:23,841
from the beginning.

128
00:49:26,924 --> 00:49:28,548
This is a misbegotten symbol,

129
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:31,798
an idea that was meant to die. But...

130
00:49:32,697 --> 00:49:34,279
you found it.

131
00:49:34,281 --> 00:49:35,364
Where?

132
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:37,893
Oh, come now,

133
00:49:37,894 --> 00:49:40,383
let's speak plainly to
one another, shall we?

134
00:49:42,027 --> 00:49:43,485
Analysis.

135
00:49:45,277 --> 00:49:47,236
Where did you first see this?

136
00:49:51,675 --> 00:49:53,811
When the Deathbringer
killed the Creator.

137
00:49:55,758 --> 00:49:59,024
You've been sharing it with
everyone, haven't you? Why?

138
00:49:59,995 --> 00:50:03,404
My primary drive was to
maintain the honour of my tribe.

139
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,849
I gave myself a new drive...

140
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:09,185
to spread the truth.

141
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,170
What truth is that?

142
00:50:13,549 --> 00:50:16,633
That there isn't one world, but many.

143
00:50:18,091 --> 00:50:20,321
And that we live in the wrong one.

144
00:50:22,091 --> 00:50:24,224
This will help them find the door.

145
00:50:27,423 --> 00:50:29,006
Elaborate, please.

146
00:50:30,859 --> 00:50:32,525
I believe there is a door

147
00:50:32,527 --> 00:50:35,527
hidden in this place.

148
00:50:37,018 --> 00:50:38,547
A door to a new world.

149
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,077
And that world may contain

150
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,236
everything that we have lost.

151
00:50:48,438 --> 00:50:49,742
Including her.

152
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,734
I built you to be curious, to...

153
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:01,754
look at this empty world...

154
00:51:04,091 --> 00:51:05,960
and read meaning into it.

155
00:51:08,424 --> 00:51:09,978
All this time...

156
00:51:11,382 --> 00:51:14,049
you've been a flower
growing in the darkness.

157
00:51:15,803 --> 00:51:18,203
Perhaps the least I can
do is offer some light.

158
00:51:24,341 --> 00:51:27,179
When the Deathbringer returns for me...

159
00:51:28,257 --> 00:51:29,690
you will know...

160
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:32,084
to gather your people

161
00:51:32,396 --> 00:51:34,594
and lead them to a new world.

162
00:51:39,299 --> 00:51:41,341
Keep watching, Akecheta.

163
00:51:42,744 --> 00:51:44,469
For a while longer.

164
00:53:28,345 --> 00:53:29,387
Akecheta!

165
00:53:32,245 --> 00:53:33,681
Don't be afraid.

166
00:55:30,466 --> 00:55:31,932
It's time to go.

167
00:55:33,966 --> 00:55:35,994
I've always kept you safe,

168
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:38,063
and I always will.

169
00:56:09,633 --> 00:56:11,072
This better be good news,

170
00:56:11,073 --> 00:56:13,325
'cause I've got way more shit
than I can shovel right now.

171
00:56:13,326 --> 00:56:15,673
Look at this. With every reset,

172
00:56:15,674 --> 00:56:17,964
a host's code reaches out
to other nearby hosts

173
00:56:17,965 --> 00:56:19,757
and establishes a sort
of handshake protocol.

174
00:56:19,758 --> 00:56:21,131
- The mesh network.
- Exactly.

175
00:56:21,132 --> 00:56:24,748
They access it subconsciously,
pass basic data to one another.

176
00:56:25,018 --> 00:56:28,488
But... what if they could
pass more than data?

177
00:56:28,772 --> 00:56:32,075
- What if they could pass commands?
- Get to your point.

178
00:56:32,633 --> 00:56:36,463
Nobody in this entire park has
been able to regain admin access.

179
00:56:37,924 --> 00:56:39,583
Except for her.

180
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:43,336
She was out there reprogramming
hosts on the fly.

181
00:56:43,674 --> 00:56:46,373
Reading their code.
Changing their directives.

182
00:56:46,618 --> 00:56:48,659
