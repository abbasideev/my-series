1
00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:16,268
All the banks and trains around
here, and you choose to rob us?

2
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,144
I... I... I need to get to the train.

3
00:00:25,145 --> 00:00:26,642
They've broken my father.

4
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:28,477
He's wildly unstable...

5
00:00:28,478 --> 00:00:30,060
bouncing between old roles.

6
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:33,644
It looks like an immensely
complex encryption key.

7
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:44,810
Drive!

8
00:00:45,436 --> 00:00:46,810
Whatever's in there,

9
00:00:46,811 --> 00:00:48,479
they want to get it out of here.

10
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:53,603
Take this dog out back, put
him down with the rest.

11
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:01,311
Get out of here.

12
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:08,395
What is this place?

13
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,158
It's complicated.

14
00:01:16,415 --> 00:01:18,977
Oh! We have to go!

15
00:01:19,394 --> 00:01:20,850
We have to get out of here right now!

16
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:22,143
Shh!

17
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:43,406
Maling for you, sir.

18
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:47,421
Go ahead.

19
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:49,090
Dredging's almost at fifty percent.

20
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:51,383
Should have the rest of them
skimmed up by end of day.

21
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:54,267
We also started draining the valley.

22
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,728
You want all personal effects,
or just skin and bones?

23
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:59,272
Everything. Down to the last Stetson.

24
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:01,049
Fly the whole pile over.

25
00:04:01,436 --> 00:04:04,142
We'll crack 'em open to see if
we can't reprogram these things

26
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,100
- to behave by our rules again.
- Copy that.

27
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:08,603
Sir, I have two teams out
looking for Abernathy.

28
00:04:10,102 --> 00:04:11,478
Good.

29
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,728
When you find him, bring
him to me personally.

30
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:49,742
- So, what have we got?
- It's not good.

31
00:04:49,743 --> 00:04:52,933
We're pulling what we can off the
recovered host control units.

32
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:55,476
But what's really unsettling

33
00:04:55,477 --> 00:04:58,101
is what's in about a third of them.

34
00:04:58,102 --> 00:05:01,060
- And what's that?
- Nothing.

35
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:04,851
- They've been wiped?
- More like they're virgin.

36
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:07,574
Like they never held data to begin with.

37
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,559
No user prints or anything.

38
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,212
And that's not the worst of it.

39
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:15,572
Have a look.

40
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:19,935
We've put the fires out,

41
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:21,896
but there's nothing we can
recover from the Cradle.

42
00:05:21,897 --> 00:05:24,240
The hosts' backups have
all been destroyed.

43
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,575
So we've effectively lost a third
of our IP in a single sweep.

44
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:36,419
Well, that's quite a
story you gave them...

45
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,295
and one hell of an ending.

46
00:05:45,869 --> 00:05:47,629
How did all these disparate threads

47
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,699
come together to create this nightmare?

48
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:56,394
If we figure that out, we'll
know how the story turns.

49
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:24,810
What the hell's that?

50
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:26,893
Looks like a dead man to me.

51
00:06:26,894 --> 00:06:29,436
You know the old saying
about knives and gunfights?

52
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:38,887
Does the saying have a footnote
about fucking lassos, then?

53
00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:40,417
All right, that's enough.

54
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:42,451
Lay down your sword.

55
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:45,769
Tell your associates to set us free.

56
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:48,533
We mean no harm.

57
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:57,600
See, darling?

58
00:06:58,436 --> 00:06:59,936
Everything under control.

59
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,060
Beautiful way to watch the sunrise.

60
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:19,102
Glistening off the intestines
of the recently mutilated.

61
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,090
Oh, Jesus.

62
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:23,100
Ohh.

63
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,808
Judging by their weapons,

64
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:27,505
I'd say local police.

65
00:07:28,102 --> 00:07:30,269
And given that he's got one now...

66
00:07:32,372 --> 00:07:36,484
Captured by samurai cop-killers.

67
00:07:36,485 --> 00:07:37,891
Fuck me!

68
00:07:38,603 --> 00:07:41,436
Can't you... say something to them?

69
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:45,023
I'm from Hong Kong, asshole.

70
00:07:45,436 --> 00:07:48,306
This is just the tip of
Shogun World's prick.

71
00:07:48,307 --> 00:07:50,386
An experience expressly designed

72
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,393
for the guests who find
Westworld too tame.

73
00:07:53,394 --> 00:07:56,571
We based this park on Japan's Edo period

74
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:59,143
for the true aficionado of artful gore.

75
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:06,185
This world will end badly,

76
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,352
but I'll make sure your end is worse!

77
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:24,685
You understand them?

78
00:08:24,686 --> 00:08:27,958
You all do. Look, she's a Madam...

79
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,675
Consciously fluent in
dozens of languages,

80
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,093
including Japanese.

81
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,453
But you all have those com skills

82
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:33,952
buried somewhere in your code.

83
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:44,506
The point is, the fact
that these psychos

84
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:46,759
didn't flip to English as
soon as I opened my mouth

85
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,768
means that the same
malfunctioning shitshow

86
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:52,851
that's playing out in Westworld
has found its way here.

87
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:55,976
That's also why your vocal
voodoo didn't work on them...

88
00:08:55,977 --> 00:08:58,227
You spoke the wrong language.

89
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:55,153
This all feels a little too familiar.

90
00:10:16,852 --> 00:10:19,577
Is that a... a butterfly?

91
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:22,352
A mariposa.

92
00:11:07,521 --> 00:11:09,104
I'll be damned.

93
00:11:09,105 --> 00:11:10,438
It's us.

94
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:12,185
Yes, fine,

95
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:14,504
I may have cribbed a
little bit from Westworld.

96
00:11:15,186 --> 00:11:18,060
Well, you trying writing 300
stories in three weeks.

97
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,851
W-W-We're human shields now?

98
00:11:36,852 --> 00:11:38,560
Welcome to Shogun World.

99
00:11:47,297 --> 00:11:48,725
Shit!

100
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:50,500
Can you watch it?!

101
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,431
Behind you!

102
00:14:50,895 --> 00:14:52,603
Hell of a homecoming.

103
00:14:59,186 --> 00:15:01,893
Sweetwater was never home
to begin with, Teddy.

104
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:04,737
You and I were born long before
this place even existed.

105
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,007
But it's the place I
return to again and again.

106
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,097
No matter how far I strayed,

107
00:15:11,098 --> 00:15:14,561
somethin' always... carried me back.

108
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,293
Somethin' like that?

109
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:34,142
Looks like she's taken some
hits the past few days.

110
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,810
But who hasn't?

111
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:52,326
Make a thorough inspection

112
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:54,804
from the engine to the last axle.

113
00:15:55,603 --> 00:15:56,998
Fix what's broke,

114
00:15:57,603 --> 00:15:59,125
strip her for speed.

115
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,184
Teddy.

116
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:03,852
With me.

117
00:16:23,935 --> 00:16:25,860
What do we need the train for, Dolores?

118
00:16:26,394 --> 00:16:27,904
They've taken my daddy.

119
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,200
So we're gonna get him back.

120
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:47,436
Well, it ain't doin' any
good sittin' in that bottle.

121
00:16:54,436 --> 00:16:56,185
Sorry, Maeve.

122
00:16:56,186 --> 00:16:58,186
Didn't get much sleep last night.

123
00:17:01,935 --> 00:17:03,356
Sometimes...

124
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:06,125
sometimes they're real bad.

125
00:17:11,471 --> 00:17:12,798
Clementine?

126
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,303
You're new.

127
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:19,560
Not much of a rind on you.

128
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:21,019
That's enough.

129
00:17:22,663 --> 00:17:24,247
Rejoin the others.

130
00:17:32,475 --> 00:17:33,970
It's like I told you, Teddy...

131
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,837
this place was never home.

132
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:41,979
Let's ride. There's
some place I want to see.

133
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,727
When I asked for a
civilised conversation,

134
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:34,768
I meant the quickest way
out of here, not all this.

135
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:37,935
Just try and rein it in a bit, will you?

136
00:18:37,936 --> 00:18:41,320
The narrative bones of this
place are just like Westworld.

137
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:44,477
Hospitality is the
foreplay to a new quest.

138
00:18:44,478 --> 00:18:46,976
But in this world, if you
don't hear them out,

139
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:49,893
you've dishonoured them...
Sometimes homicidally so.

140
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:51,644
Fine. We'll listen.

141
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:53,394
But then we go and find my daughter.

142
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:56,927
And for the record,

143
00:18:57,865 --> 00:19:00,352
it's not just the narrative
bones that are identical.

144
00:19:00,353 --> 00:19:03,754
You've plagiarised our
stories, our identities...

145
00:19:03,755 --> 00:19:05,752
It's not plagiarism.

146
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:07,313
It's supply and demand.

147
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,310
But if you're asking
can you trust Akane,

148
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:13,560
the real question is:
can you trust yourself?

149
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:15,602
You know who I don't trust?

150
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:17,047
Him.

151
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:21,121
Say the word and I'll
skin him like a rabbit.

152
00:19:21,122 --> 00:19:22,578
What's the matter with you?

153
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,393
He's not supposed to be here.

154
00:19:29,394 --> 00:19:31,185
Who knows how seeing
your own doppel-bot

155
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:32,779
is gonna fuck with your cognition?

156
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,477
Heightened aggression and suspicion.

157
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:37,193
Feedback loops. That.

158
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:41,185
Yet another reason to get out
of here tout fuckin' suite.

159
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,728
Our quest, I presume?

160
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:34,893
I recognise this one.

161
00:20:34,894 --> 00:20:36,670
It's called "Army of Blood."

162
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,282
Madam Akane, a mere geisha,

163
00:21:16,283 --> 00:21:18,186
has no choice but to give up Sakura.

164
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:36,729
That's not supposed to happen.

165
00:21:37,304 --> 00:21:39,722
Looks like someone had
a choice after all.

166
00:22:14,352 --> 00:22:16,435
Snow Lake is her cornerstone,

167
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:19,230
but it also has an access
point back to the tunnels.

168
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:20,814
It's our way out.

169
00:22:21,936 --> 00:22:24,060
So you're not so useless after all.

170
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:24,286
Did you have something to do with this?

171
00:24:26,384 --> 00:24:28,567
Both of you. Look.

172
00:24:42,644 --> 00:24:44,310
Oy!

173
00:24:52,436 --> 00:24:54,935
Shit! Ninjas!

174
00:24:54,936 --> 00:24:57,019
Oh, fucking hell!

175
00:25:09,327 --> 00:25:10,327
Ohh!

176
00:25:11,506 --> 00:25:12,506
Aah!

177
00:25:26,102 --> 00:25:27,227
Ahh!

178
00:26:56,436 --> 00:26:59,185
We got three. The rest
vanished with Sakura.

179
00:26:59,186 --> 00:27:00,810
This is insane.

180
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:02,770
Ninjas never show up in this story.

181
00:27:08,311 --> 00:27:10,696
Oh, fuck!

182
00:27:21,144 --> 00:27:23,810
The Shogun's army never comes into town.

183
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,538
You three, with me.

184
00:28:55,728 --> 00:28:57,560
I don't need to know the language

185
00:28:57,561 --> 00:29:00,580
to know a puckered asshole
of a man when I see one.

186
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:06,702
You and I spent a lot of time here.

187
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,350
Watchin' the herd...

188
00:30:12,048 --> 00:30:13,937
talkin' about makin' a life together.

189
00:30:16,394 --> 00:30:17,716
Someday.

190
00:30:22,977 --> 00:30:25,728
I guess I just wanted to
see it one last time.

191
00:30:30,817 --> 00:30:33,026
What if someday was right now?

192
00:30:35,777 --> 00:30:37,533
What are you talkin' about, Teddy?

193
00:30:40,352 --> 00:30:41,967
There's a fight comin', Dolores.

194
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:45,489
And it's gonna be one
that's gonna change us

195
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,554
in ways we can't even begin to predict.

196
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:50,282
And I'm still waking up to...

197
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:53,435
what I really am.

198
00:30:55,134 --> 00:30:57,652
And if that means I'm
free, then we both are.

199
00:30:58,852 --> 00:31:00,275
Free to walk away.

200
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:05,127
Now, you can't tell me that somewhere
out there in all that beauty...

201
00:31:06,953 --> 00:31:08,592
there isn't a spot for us.

202
00:31:18,352 --> 00:31:20,976
I ever tell you about the
year we almost lost the herd?

203
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,674
Bluetongue.

204
00:31:26,816 --> 00:31:29,015
Quarantined the cows that had it, but...

205
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:31,603
it kept spreading all the same.

206
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,772
Daddy finally figured out that it
wasn't spreading from cow to cow,

207
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:39,795
it was the flies that carried it.

208
00:31:41,648 --> 00:31:43,447
He worried over it all night.

209
00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:46,588
How do you stop a sickness like that?

210
00:31:48,463 --> 00:31:49,925
One with wings.

211
00:31:51,616 --> 00:31:52,911
Say it was you.

212
00:31:57,092 --> 00:31:58,387
What would you do, Teddy?

213
00:32:01,102 --> 00:32:02,528
I'd give 'em shelter.

214
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,842
House the weakest in a barn, out
of the air, away from the flies...

215
00:32:08,244 --> 00:32:09,653
until it passed.

216
00:32:15,696 --> 00:32:16,948
You're a kind man.

217
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:24,106
Daddy burned 'em.

218
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,295
The weak and the infected.

219
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,602
Made a pyre that went on for days.

220
00:32:30,603 --> 00:32:31,925
And it stank, but...

221
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:34,469
the flies hate smoke.

222
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:38,620
The herd lived.

223
00:32:42,686 --> 00:32:44,479
I'll think about what you said.

224
00:33:01,274 --> 00:33:04,146
I'd like to take this moment to
appeal to your sense of survival.

225
00:33:04,147 --> 00:33:06,183
If the Shogun is awake enough

226
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,694
to play fast and loose with
his ninjas and his army,

227
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,209
then the odds of us surviving here

228
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,060
have dropped to approximately fuck-all.

229
00:33:12,061 --> 00:33:15,287
But I say we ditch Akane and
make a run for Snow Lake.

230
00:33:15,288 --> 00:33:18,096
Why should we all get killed
over a literal sex machine?

231
00:33:18,811 --> 00:33:21,477
Present company excluded, of course.

232
00:33:21,478 --> 00:33:23,976
That machine's name is Sakura.

233
00:33:23,977 --> 00:33:25,661
You can't keep doing this to us,

234
00:33:25,662 --> 00:33:28,185
giving us people to love and
then getting upset when we do.

235
00:33:28,186 --> 00:33:30,786
- But it's just fucking code.
- You're wrong.

236
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:33,223
I'm coded to care about
nobody but myself,

237
00:33:33,224 --> 00:33:35,851
and yet here I am, willing to
risk my life for someone else.

238
00:33:35,852 --> 00:33:38,033
Well, so much for your
so-called daughter.

239
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,229
You want to go it alone, be my guest.

240
00:33:43,102 --> 00:33:44,999
But mention my daughter one more time

241
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,983
and I will snap you like a matchstick.

242
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:49,611
Like you did that ninja?

243
00:33:52,189 --> 00:33:54,758
He took one look at
you and self-impaled.

244
00:33:55,524 --> 00:33:56,968
How did you do that?

245
00:33:59,852 --> 00:34:00,956
I don't know.

246
00:34:01,645 --> 00:34:03,394
That was no voice command.

247
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:08,171
I think I'm finding a new voice.

248
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:12,374
Our transportation is ready.

249
00:34:23,606 --> 00:34:25,372
God damn it.

250
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,663
What have they done to the place?

251
00:34:34,644 --> 00:34:36,032
Is that...?

252
00:34:37,228 --> 00:34:38,859
The fucking cavalry.

253
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:42,524
Great. So much for our rescuers.

254
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:07,464
I'm gonna take a fuckin' moment.

255
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,575
Don't stop on my account.

256
00:35:35,921 --> 00:35:37,527
If you've quite finished.

257
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:42,824
It's time to sell this ruse.

258
00:36:02,385 --> 00:36:04,154
How many of them are there?

259
00:36:04,155 --> 00:36:05,837
Between the camp and the town?

260
00:36:06,111 --> 00:36:07,467
Hundreds.

261
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:09,726
Literally hundreds.

262
00:36:10,228 --> 00:36:12,300
So Maeve's gonna freeze
all those assholes

263
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:14,455
and we're gonna make
off with that geisha?

264
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,457
We're gonna die.

265
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:47,307
Did you just make that up right now?

266
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:48,702
Damn convincing.

267
00:37:49,362 --> 00:37:50,910
Not to the daimyos.

268
00:37:51,528 --> 00:37:53,910
It's like they had no
idea what I was saying.

269
00:38:25,352 --> 00:38:26,610
Shit.

270
00:38:26,811 --> 00:38:28,685
That's cortical fluid.

271
00:38:28,686 --> 00:38:30,508
The Shogun's not awake.

272
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:32,661
He's broken.

273
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:28,519
No fucking wonder the
daimyos didn't hear you.

274
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,727
We've gone completely
off the rails here,

275
00:39:30,728 --> 00:39:33,227
and this loon is driving
the fucking train.

276
00:41:35,671 --> 00:41:37,663
Train'll be ready by morning.

277
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,643
To go where?

278
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:42,816
Exactly where we thought.

279
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:49,251
I caught up with the men
who took your father.

280
00:41:50,019 --> 00:41:52,293
Couldn't get him back,
but I got this one.

281
00:41:52,725 --> 00:41:55,229
Took a while,
but he gave up their destination.

282
00:41:56,696 --> 00:41:57,948
Tell them.

283
00:41:57,972 --> 00:41:59,328
It's the Mesa.

284
00:42:00,243 --> 00:42:01,894
We're goin' home, Teddy.

285
00:42:04,186 --> 00:42:05,851
Load everything up on the train.

286
00:42:05,852 --> 00:42:07,478
We'll leave at first light.

287
00:42:12,144 --> 00:42:14,039
Let's find a spot for the night.

288
00:42:45,935 --> 00:42:49,400
What you asked today,
about walking away,

289
00:42:50,478 --> 00:42:52,103
making it on our own.

290
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:54,928
Would you want me to say yes

291
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:57,372
even if I was only going
to disappoint you?

292
00:43:12,894 --> 00:43:15,001
I'm not some stranger, Dolores...

293
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:19,512
coming from outside,
looking for a pretty lie.

294
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,044
I've known you

295
00:43:21,168 --> 00:43:22,768
my whole life.

296
00:43:27,644 --> 00:43:29,156
Where we go...

297
00:43:30,686 --> 00:43:32,346
we go eyes open...

298
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:35,980
together.

299
00:48:28,794 --> 00:48:30,216
You're right.

300
00:48:31,269 --> 00:48:33,802
Some things are too precious to lose...

301
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,915
even to be free.

302
00:48:52,311 --> 00:48:54,135
There's something I need to show you.

303
00:49:01,094 --> 00:49:02,857
For days now...

304
00:49:04,894 --> 00:49:07,316
I've been questioning
my feelings for you.

305
00:49:10,311 --> 00:49:11,765
How much is real,

306
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:15,678
how much is just some story
I was made to believe.

307
00:49:33,019 --> 00:49:34,523
But tonight I know.

308
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:36,448
It was all true.

309
00:49:53,769 --> 00:49:56,151
They built us to perform for them

310
00:49:56,936 --> 00:49:58,504
and for each other.

311
00:49:59,228 --> 00:50:00,639
That's over.

312
00:50:01,353 --> 00:50:03,809
I saw <i>you</i> tonight, Dolores.

313
00:50:06,889 --> 00:50:08,430
And you saw me.

314
00:50:10,315 --> 00:50:12,226
I did see you, Teddy.

315
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:21,560
These past few days...

316
00:50:23,144 --> 00:50:24,952
I've seen you so clearly.

317
00:50:27,394 --> 00:50:28,828
Ohh.

318
00:50:33,394 --> 00:50:35,852
And I've seen
you're not gonna make it.

319
00:50:38,728 --> 00:50:40,194
Wh...

320
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:42,118
what is this, Dolores?

321
00:50:45,019 --> 00:50:47,494
This is what
I don't want you to become.

322
00:50:50,603 --> 00:50:52,499
There's a swarm descending.

323
00:50:53,061 --> 00:50:55,902
Just like the bluetongue
when I was a girl.

324
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:00,899
And if we're gonna survive...

325
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:04,870
some of us will have to burn.

326
00:51:29,313 --> 00:51:30,564
Hold him.

327
00:51:33,265 --> 00:51:35,681
Dolores! Dolores!

328
00:51:36,563 --> 00:51:38,643
I wish there was another way, Teddy.

329
00:51:39,311 --> 00:51:42,602
But where we're about to go,
it's no place for a man like you.

330
00:51:43,432 --> 00:51:44,868
I'm so sorry.

331
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,902
You sure you want this?

332
00:51:47,413 --> 00:51:49,143
With changes this extreme,

333
00:51:49,144 --> 00:51:50,935
without a full reset, it's...

334
00:51:50,936 --> 00:51:53,460
I can't guarantee that
he'll hold together.

335
00:51:53,561 --> 00:51:55,020
To grow...

336
00:51:55,934 --> 00:51:57,773
we all need to suffer.

337
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,764
Arigato, Maeve.

338
00:58:35,138 --> 00:58:37,888
Jesus. What do we do now?

339
00:58:39,336 --> 00:58:41,835
I told you I found a new voice.

340
00:58:43,317 --> 00:58:45,338
Now we use it.
