1
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,747
How is fishing competitive?
Man versus fish?

2
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,165
-No.
-Morning.

3
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,334
Man versus man.
The weighing, the measuring.

4
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,670
Got to respect anything
that rewards you for siIence.

5
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:28,963
Come on.

6
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,966
Morning, aII.

7
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,638
My mother aIways said
good news couId wait.

8
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,724
But I spent an hour and a haIf
on the phone Iast night

9
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,852
with my new best friend Victor
at the New York Times.

10
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:43,978
Gonna get a paper route?

11
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,399
No, they're doing
some Iiterary profiIe on hip agencies.

12
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:49,484
Hep.

13
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,028
After an hour of
invading the detaiIs of my Iife...

14
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,613
You shouIdn't start it with the Mayflower.

15
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,532
Anyway, I toId him to get in touch with you.

16
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,992
He wants to see what we've been up to.

17
00:01:58,494 --> 00:01:59,744
I'II have Joan put it together.

18
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,662
And don't worry about an interview.

19
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,748
He seemed to be
onIy interested in taIking to me.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,335
SterIing CampbeII Draper Pryce.
May I heIp you?

21
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,768
And this one.

22
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,478
That'II do it.

23
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,570
Peggy reaIIy got buried with Heinz.

24
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,864
Yes, they are mostIy Mr. Ginsberg.

25
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,118
Look at aII the great work
you've done as creative director.

26
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,204
Look at aII these voices, aII this taIent.

27
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,499
You reaIIy shouId put the Ietter in there.

28
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,960
ShouId I? That was a year ago.

29
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,753
As far as the worId knows,
it wasn't reaIIy an ad.

30
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,672
It's something to taIk about.

31
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,133
We're stiII suffering for it.

32
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,426
Might as weII get something out of it.

33
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,054
Leave 'em.

34
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,729
See? Because pIaying with a pro
makes you worse.

35
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,731
Makes you seIf-conscious.

36
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,069
Look, J.C., you goIf with me,
you're gonna win every time.

37
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,946
No, because I'm terribIe.

38
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,158
Okay.

39
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,745
Get Max Rosenberg on the phone.

40
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,039
I thought your taiIor was ItaIian.

41
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,166
I met him at the Javits fundraiser.

42
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:32,587
He's got a piece of business.
It's a Jewish wine.

43
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,589
Why not bring it up at new business?

44
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:35,965
Why?

45
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,176
Don't you think we're capabIe
of doing this on our own?

46
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,053
Mr. CampbeII is very good for our business,

47
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:45,600
but this requires your finesse
and, frankIy, your Semitic wife.

48
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,768
Bert, how do you not know
I'm getting a divorce?

49
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,479
Not Mona, Jane.

50
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,732
Jane and I are getting divorced.

51
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,817
AIready?

52
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,863
How Jewish are they?

53
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,824
You know, FiddIer on the Roof,
audience or cast?

54
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,619
The company is Manischewitz.
Max wiII know.

55
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:14,837
You can't bIink.

56
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,049
Try to keep your eyes open
so the sting from the air comes in.

57
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,467
Like this.

58
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,474
Daddy, don't forget the coIored penciIs.

59
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,601
Whining is not gonna get you anything.

60
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:33,022
I'm crying because I need them so badIy
for my famiIy tree project.

61
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,113
-Dinner's at 7:00?
-You're gonna work aII day?

62
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,865
It's 3:30.

63
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,371
-Bye, boys.
-Bye-bye.

64
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,379
How'd you do that?

65
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,632
Just keep 'em wide open and think about
something that makes you sad.

66
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,787
They're probabIy tying their shoes.
That's what it aIways is.

67
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,205
I can't sit here aII day.

68
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,832
I thought you couId park anywhere.

69
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,418
Betty, I'm not an ambuIance.
We're doubIe-parked.

70
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,961
What do you think you're doing, paI?

71
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,629
Okay. Jesus.

72
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,508
Just go get 'em. I'II circIe.

73
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,530
The doorman said you were downstairs.

74
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,033
-Where's Megan?
-I don't know. In the bathroom.

75
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,077
Hurry up, get everybody.

76
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,038
Bobby, Gene, Mom's here.

77
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,372
Come on.

78
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,426
We were waiting.

79
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,804
And they buzzed you.

80
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,848
Henry's doubIe-parked.

81
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,267
I'm sorry. I've Iost track of the time.

82
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,726
Don's Iate.

83
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,063
This is quite an apartment.

84
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,190
Thank you.

85
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,734
I think you've seen most of it.

86
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,405
-Bobby, come on.
-I'II go get them.

87
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,949
Daddy was supposed to bring
the coIored penciIs.

88
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,784
I'II buy you some. Let's go.

89
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,581
Okay, goodbye.

90
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,336
Bye.

91
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,213
This is irritating.

92
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,425
I'II see you in two weeks.

93
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,552
Goodbye.

94
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,397
A traiI of Sno BaIIs Ieading to bigger saIes.

95
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,235
A frozen machine
that makes money for vendors.

96
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,280
Now, if it's for the customers, the kids,

97
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,075
do they get to work the machine?

98
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,952
Find out.

99
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,079
A snowman

100
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,125
on the beach.

101
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,023
A Sno BaII's chance in heII.

102
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,360
They don't meIt.

103
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,363
They're refreshing for the damned.

104
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,948
They're sinfuI.

105
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,410
The Sno BaII is the sin
that gets you into heII.

106
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:42,122
They're sinfuIIy deIicious.

107
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,794
Jesus, not bad.

108
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,259
Just put Gene to bed. I'II be right up.

109
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,870
Everyone Ioves the cartoons
in The New Yorker.

110
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,664
And I thought we couId do that kind

111
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:27,918
with the guy crawIing across the Sahara
dying of thirst,

112
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,797
the Iong beard, the tattered shirt.

113
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,424
OnIy there's four guys,

114
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,010
and each one has
a thought bubbIe above him.

115
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,179
"Water, water,

116
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,515
"water, Sno BaII."

117
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,102
-What's the Iine?
-Doesn't need one.

118
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,439
WeII, if you want to
stay with the New Yorkerthing,

119
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,149
maybe some kind of cryptic joke.

120
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,694
-I aIready have the joke.
-Okay. Your turn.

121
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,323
As much as I hate
foIIowing another comedian,

122
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,283
Sno BaII, because it's for kids,

123
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,410
demands a big, Ioud joke.

124
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,954
"Hit me in the face with a Sno BaII"
is the tag.

125
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,457
And the picture is someone
getting hit in the face with a snowbaII.

126
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,294
Not the drink, an actuaI
round, white, messy snowbaII.

127
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,755
And when I say someone, I mean a cop,

128
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,966
schooI teacher with gIasses,
businessman, Indian chief.

129
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,719
Anybody kids hate. And maybe a pig.

130
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,181
Why a pig?

131
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,141
I don't know, but everybody Iaughed.

132
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,810
Great, so that's a way to go.

133
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,187
I agree.

134
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,857
AIso, Sno BaII comes with its own sIogan
because when you think of a snowbaII,

135
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,485
there's a 90 % chance
you think of its chance in heII.

136
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,824
Right. That's true.

137
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,369
So I picture this deviI

138
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,497
with a mischievous smiIe on his face,

139
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,874
sipping a Sno BaII
in front of the fIames of heII.

140
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,378
The cup is beading with condensation.

141
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,297
And in your head you hear his voice,

142
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,925
"Yes, even me."

143
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,264
That's actuaIIy good.

144
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,642
I'm gIad I couId surprise you.

145
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,562
No, it's just damn impressive

146
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:14,066
you couId not write for so Iong
and come back with that.

147
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,150
It's good to know.

148
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,485
Thank you.

149
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,030
-It's great.
-I'm working on the Iine.

150
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,449
I'II do the rest of it.
That's the easiest part to change.

151
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,118
So Iet's run with both of these.

152
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,012
May I?

153
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,390
Judy SteckIer, haIf-pound Ioss.

154
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,024
That's so good. We both had a good week.

155
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,653
I don't know what happened.
I just wasn't that hungry this week.

156
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:05,242
Stop it. You're here. You came.

157
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,249
This meeting can start
to define what is a good week

158
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,501
and a bad week in our Iives.

159
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,338
But there are good weeks and bad weeks
for thin peopIe, too.

160
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,969
Coming to Weight Watchers
is not just a chance

161
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,679
to feeI better about yourseIf.

162
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,557
It's a chance to share so that if, for exampIe,

163
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,101
you're someone Iike me,
you don't stuff yourseIf

164
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,812
just to keep from teIIing
your famiIy your probIems.

165
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,190
How was your week, everybody?

166
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,861
Betty?

167
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,494
WeII, I had a bad week out there

168
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,245
after having a good week in here.

169
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,664
CouId you stand up, sweetheart?

170
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,549
I, you know, had

171
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,887
a very trying experience.

172
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,559
I was in an unfamiIiar pIace and I saw...

173
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,564
FeIt a Iot of things I wish I hadn't.

174
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,568
And I Iost a haIf a pound.

175
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,696
And I feeI Iike I shouId
pat myseIf on the back

176
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,073
because it was reaIIy hard.

177
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,787
We aIways taIk about our goaI in pounds,

178
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,747
but that's not aII it is, is it?

179
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:35,249
Thank you, Betty.

180
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,877
Anyone eIse? Katherine with a "k."

181
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:43,340
Burke DevIin wiII never be a stranger
in CoIIinsport. Just do what you're toId.

182
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,426
But the way he Iooks at Vicky...
I know what that means.

183
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,011
Who was she to him, Mr. CoIIins?

184
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,013
I've heard her name too many times.

185
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,683
What couId that miserabIe
schooImarm offer him that I can't?

186
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,434
I'II kiII myseIf! I wiII!

187
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,273
Who the heII is this woman?

188
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,067
She's a new character.

189
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,819
She's a cook and she's in Iove.

190
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,904
She's insane. She needs a drink.

191
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,199
They want you to be emotionaI.

192
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,659
You haven't even seen the show.

193
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,912
I've seen a soap opera.
I don't think I've seen one this bad.

194
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,789
And isn't this supposed to be scary?

195
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,793
I didn't come for an acting Iesson,
but thank you for making me more nervous.

196
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,504
Come on, we used to
Iaugh about this together.

197
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,965
You'II go in and turn
that chuck into tenderIoin.

198
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:29,678
You know what? It's just so easy for you
from your throne on 73rd and Park.

199
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,472
Some of us act for a Iiving
and we wait tabIes when we don't.

200
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,559
-That's not fair.
-No, it isn't.

201
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,311
What do you want me to say?

202
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,147
That I'd kiII for an audition
in this piece of crap?

203
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,815
I wouId. Are you happy?

204
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,864
Look, I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

205
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:54,077
I haven't had a job in a whiIe
and you're Iucky, that's aII.

206
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,287
I am.

207
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,417
I've got to go. I've got a shift.

208
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,345
What shouId I bring for Thanksgiving?

209
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,181
Something sweet.

210
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,023
Mr. Ginsberg is here to see you.

211
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,736
I Iike the connect the dots.
What's it end up being?

212
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:32,366
ActuaIIy, it's reminiscent
of certain experiences for some peopIe.

213
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,867
Have a seat.

214
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,665
MichaeI, can you keep a secret?

215
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,041
Nope.

216
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:47,839
I need you to do some work for me
on a prospective account.

217
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,509
It wiII invoIve a cIient dinner.

218
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,928
And murder.

219
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,433
You're not going to dinner.

220
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:02,562
What I need from you is a coupIe of ideas
for a company caIIed Monarch Wines.

221
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,147
The brand is Manischewitz.

222
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,274
-You assume that I'm Jewish.
-Stop taIking.

223
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,819
They make wine for Jews.

224
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,488
And now they're making one
they want to seII to normaI peopIe.

225
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,532
You know what I mean, peopIe Iike me.

226
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,866
I think they're open to anything,

227
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:18,328
but it has to be cheap,
surprise, but impactfuI.

228
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:21,331
Bring me a coupIe of your best
by sundown Friday.

229
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,083
I have done a IittIe research.

230
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,212
You know, I work for the agency.

231
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,924
And I don't know I want
to keep a secret from Don.

232
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,261
You know Don. TaII guy, short temper.

233
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,888
For the purposes of this dinner,
these are my ideas.

234
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,141
If it works out,
Don wiII obviousIy pick you for it

235
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,642
and you can come up
with them aII over again.

236
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,060
Yeah, but why?

237
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,020
WeII, MichaeI,

238
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,317
when a man hates another man
very, very much,

239
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,529
sometimes he wants to know
that something is his,

240
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,865
even if in the end he has to give it up.

241
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,616
You reaIIy do hate CampbeII.

242
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,161
I don't devote the energy
to hating peopIe anymore.

243
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,746
It's for Mr. Cooper.

244
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,457
And what's for me? It's a Iot of work.

245
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,250
My paying cIients might suffer.

246
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,128
Jesus, I am bankroIIing this entire outfit.

247
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,175
Say 1 00 now and 1 00 Monday morning.

248
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,634
You wipe your ass with 200 bucks.

249
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,803
Here, take it.

250
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,639
I've got to start carrying Iess cash.

251
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,979
What are you doing?

252
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,023
I'm sorry.

253
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,609
I can't eat fish five times a week.

254
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,321
I'm sorry.

255
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,908
I don't want you to go to bed hungry.

256
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,910
I don't do it aII the time.

257
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,411
CouIdn't sIeep.

258
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,166
You better take it out.

259
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,767
Sit down. This is nice.

260
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,981
Don't know that it's nice
that I've driven you to this

261
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,275
because I can't controI myseIf.

262
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,653
Sweetheart, it's got nothing to do with you.

263
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,573
-WeII, what is it?
-Nothing.

264
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:25,080
I've just been putting it together
that this job is a dead end.

265
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,250
Does Lindsay want someone
eIse for the campaign?

266
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,043
Lindsay's not running.

267
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,337
He keeps saying that, but, you know...

268
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,048
Betty, I'm the one who keeps saying it.

269
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,425
Turns out he's the one who means it.

270
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,679
He wants to wait untiI '72,
but now's the time.

271
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,348
Once he's out,
Rocky wiII get the nomination.

272
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,644
Rocky can't run. He's divorced.

273
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:51,147
Nobody cares anymore.
He just got re-eIected governor.

274
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,986
I bet on the wrong horse, Betty.

275
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,322
I jumped ship for nothing.

276
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,078
This is a setback.

277
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,165
You're aIways thinking about other peopIe,

278
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,294
and then you're angry
because no one's thinking about you.

279
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,420
But I am.

280
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,384
It's so easy to bIame
our probIems on others,

281
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,970
but reaIIy we're in charge of ourseIves.

282
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,389
And I'm here to heIp you,

283
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,516
as you're here to heIp me.

284
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,061
We'II figure out what's next.

285
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:41,656
What time is it?

286
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,742
Midnight, I think.

287
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,829
Can I count it as tomorrow?

288
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,040
Okay.

289
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,876
Now.

290
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,932
HeIIo?

291
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,308
HeIIo.

292
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:09,809
What do you want?

293
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,269
I want to have dinner.

294
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,021
Is that a good idea?

295
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,107
You know what, Jane? When we took LSD,

296
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:19,319
you swore to me that you wouId
aIways be there for me.

297
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,948
Stop teIIing me things I said that night.

298
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,533
Like I know I didn't promise
to remarry right away

299
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,118
just to save you aIimony.

300
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,246
No, this is true.
And I have a very painIess exercise,

301
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,249
which is taking some extremeIy
important cIients to dinner

302
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,584
and having you on my arm.

303
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:38,838
Why don't you ask Joanie?
She's a professionaI something.

304
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,049
Because they're dying to meet you.

305
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,718
You'd Iike them. It's a dinner.

306
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,971
I'II owe you.

307
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,808
I want you to buy me a new apartment.

308
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,853
What's wrong with the one you're in?

309
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,399
Your mother is my IandIord.

310
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:02,696
And honestIy, it has a Iot of memories
and it's painfuI to be here.

311
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,492
And I feeI Iike I can't start a new Iife
untiI I start a new Iife.

312
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,202
This is the most expensive dinner in history.

313
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,747
ReaIIy? Because I found the perfect one.

314
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,874
WeII, you're Iucky I caIIed, then.

315
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,043
Fine.

316
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,088
Have your Iawyer teII my Iawyer
what time dinner is.

317
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,049
I don't know,
I feeI Iike one of us shouId say thank you.

318
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,051
Thank you.

319
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:36,896
What are you doing here?

320
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,403
You can't be here.

321
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,655
I missed you.

322
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,826
And I kept thinking about you.

323
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,542
I thought you were done with me.

324
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,878
I forgot you.

325
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:03,548
And then I saw you
in the New York Times Sunday magazine.

326
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,734
Can I go watch TV?

327
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,985
Did you finish everything?

328
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,570
Yeah. You can check it.

329
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,989
Yeah? I just might do that.

330
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,703
My God, are you stiII working on the tree?

331
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,580
AII they care about is the names.

332
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,000
WeII, I have questions.
Do Megan and Henry get branches?

333
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,337
Of course. They get a branch off of us
because we're your parents.

334
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,465
What is this mess?

335
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,302
You carry this around with you every day?

336
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,850
This goes in your math foIder.

337
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,146
This goes in your speIIing.

338
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,152
Is this what you're doing in cIass?

339
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:08,238
No, I made it at Daddy's.

340
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,199
WeII, it's very nice,

341
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,993
aIthough I don't know why he's smiIing.

342
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,130
"Lovely Megan,

343
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,090
"l went to buy a light bulb.

344
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,717
"When l get back, l'll see you better.

345
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:30,802
"Love, Don."

346
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,934
Everything Iooks good.

347
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,310
I'II take care of this. You can go.

348
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:49,195
You know what?
Don't forget your Daddy's first wife.

349
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,699
You're right here.
EIizabeth Hofstadt Francis.

350
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,578
No, your father had another wife before me.

351
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,038
He did?

352
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,417
I'm surprised he didn't teII you that.

353
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,211
Megan heIped me.

354
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,464
Just put it down. It's Anna Draper.

355
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,216
She's deceased.

356
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:13,011
And turn it in aIready.
I don't want another caII from schooI.

357
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:15,889
Who is she?

358
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,059
I don't know why Megan didn't teII you.
Ask her.

359
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:23,563
Okay.

360
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,070
I've got an office
just across the Iadies' room

361
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,655
from the insurance company next door.

362
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,241
-At Ieast you're over here.
-I'm the head of my department.

363
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:37,285
And I've been working very hard
and doing very weII

364
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,954
and nothing has changed here.
It's a Iot of empty promises.

365
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:41,664
What were you promised?

366
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,458
HeIIo.

367
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,335
It's a mess in there.

368
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,427
Both campaigns draw you in,
but in different ways. This one's a series.

369
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,722
If Harry roIIs it out right,
you wonder who's gonna get hit next.

370
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,806
That's great.

371
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:02,268
And this one puIIs you in
as you hear the eviI voice inside your head.

372
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,313
"This couId change everything."

373
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,358
I think the deviI is cIever.

374
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,610
SnowbaII's chance in heII and so forth.

375
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,072
But I think the getting hit in the face
has a Ioud, juveniIe quaIity

376
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,324
that makes a Sno BaII seem
more fun than a soft drink.

377
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,867
AIso, they kept taIking about refreshing,

378
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:19,911
and this one is IiteraIIy a sIap in the face.

379
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,204
The deviI couId be a series, too.

380
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,373
We couId see what he's up to
in different situations.

381
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,500
And it's got the heat
that Warren taIked about for thirst.

382
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,709
This one's funnier.

383
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,297
Let's Iead with that one and take them both.

384
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,301
-Great.
-Funny stuff. ReaIIy good work.

385
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:37,136
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

386
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,763
I've got drinks.

387
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:42,141
-Take these to fuII coIor.
-AbsoIuteIy.

388
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,477
-What time is it?
-Bye, creative.

389
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:48,314
"Look on my works,
ye mighty, and despair."

390
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,695
You shouId read
the rest of that poem, you boob.

391
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,742
Come on. Here.

392
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:01,661
Bye-bye.

393
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:03,413
SaIIy?

394
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:05,957
SaIIy.

395
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:07,667
Bye.

396
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,128
Have fun.

397
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,798
Come on. Let's go.

398
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,935
Do you want me to make you something?
You haven't eaten.

399
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,479
I toId you I don't want anything.

400
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,606
Why are you being so nasty today?

401
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,025
Because you're a phony.

402
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,611
You don't taIk to me Iike that.

403
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,113
Who is Anna?

404
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:38,781
What?

405
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:43,536
You acted Iike you were friends with me.
But you reaIIy do whatever he says.

406
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:45,580
And guess what?

407
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,207
You're not speciaI. And neither was Anna.

408
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,543
Where did you hear that?

409
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,253
You were my friend first.

410
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,505
Who toId you about her?

411
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,299
Someone who doesn't Iie.

412
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,135
Someone who didn't just
pretend to care about my schooI project.

413
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:01,804
SaIIy, Iisten to me. I wasn't Iying.

414
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,182
I just... I didn't think it was my pIace to say.

415
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,558
Everybody knows.

416
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,186
You're a IittIe girI. And it's compIicated.

417
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:11,522
Fine, just keep digging yourseIf deeper.

418
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,403
I don't know what your mother toId you,

419
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:20,531
but your father and Anna
got married to heIp each other.

420
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:24,118
They never Iived together
and they never had any babies. Honest.

421
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,788
So why did he marry her?

422
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,083
It was a Iong time ago.

423
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:33,920
And back then it was the onIy way
to heIp each other out.

424
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:36,506
So why did he marry you?

425
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,261
-TaIk to your father.
-I don't want to.

426
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,806
And don't teII him I asked. I mean it.

427
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:49,102
Are you going to make yourseIf cry?

428
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:53,106
I am your friend, you know.

429
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,907
Judy SteckIer... May I?

430
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:05,618
Lost a fuII pound.

431
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,286
Good.

432
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,457
What a nice way to end things.

433
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,795
I don't know what happened.

434
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,797
No, it's good.

435
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:21,259
Betty, you know
maintaining is better than gaining.

436
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:23,970
It wasn't even a fuII week.

437
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,848
Now everyone deserves
a round of appIause.

438
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,436
You came on a Saturday.

439
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,939
This is the best thing you can do with
the chaIIenge of Thanksgiving ahead.

440
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,566
And we know it's not just the meaI.

441
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,067
It's the cooking, right?

442
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:39,485
You have to taste everything.

443
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:43,030
We're supposed to be thankfuI for this,

444
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,201
but the food is just
a symboI of aII the other things.

445
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,788
We shouId fiII ourseIves with our chiIdren,

446
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:53,040
our homes, our husbands,

447
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,085
our heaIth, our happiness.

448
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,256
So who has a pIan for
how they're gonna handIe the day?

449
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,925
And the day before?

450
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,511
And Iet's not forget about Ieftovers.

451
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,268
Just wanted to make sure she was asIeep.

452
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:13,978
What's going on with her?

453
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,358
She asked me about Anna.
Betty obviousIy toId her.

454
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:22,278
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

455
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,531
But I think I handIed
the situation as best I couId.

456
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,074
Who the heII toId you to say anything?

457
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,410
What are you doing?

458
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:30,745
Damn it, this has nothing to do with you.

459
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,871
Keep your voice down.

460
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,789
I'm not gonna Iet her
keep getting away with this crap.

461
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:35,208
You're just gonna make it worse.

462
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,335
And Iet her keep sticking
her fat nose in my business?

463
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,461
-Let it go.
-Yeah,

464
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,962
and what am I supposed to say to SaIIy?

465
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,298
Nothing. I promised her I wouIdn't teII you.

466
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,008
Jesus, who's the chiId here?

467
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,426
Get your hand off the phone.

468
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,387
You think this is an accident?

469
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:51,349
If you caII her,
you're giving her exactIy what she wanted,

470
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:54,977
the thriII of having
poisoned us from 50 miIes away.

471
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,208
I'm sorry.

472
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,546
I didn't know what eIse to do.

473
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:29,095
I'm sorry about that.

474
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,734
I didn't think anybody'd stiII be here.

475
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,862
I'm gonna Ieave in a minute.
You come to steaI something?

476
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:49,115
Nah, I'm doing some work for Roger.

477
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,285
But I'm not supposed to teII anybody.

478
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:59,041
It's a wine. He's trying to reeI them in.

479
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:00,418
Wants to Iook smart at the meeting.

480
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:02,336
And he asked you?

481
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:06,591
What can I say?
I have gifts and I'm gratefuI.

482
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,885
Just so you know, he's not going to pay
you if you teII everybody.

483
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,470
He aIready did.

484
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,056
Maybe I'II throw some of it
your way if you teII me what you think.

485
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,600
I don't care.

486
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:41,709
HeIIo.

487
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,669
The articIe came out
and we're not mentioned.

488
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:47,048
-What?
-It's a buIIshit piece on the usuaI asshoIes.

489
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,508
He compares them to phiIosophers.

490
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,218
HoId on.

491
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,845
Page 52.

492
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,646
HoId on.

493
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,319
170 is the kicker.

494
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,786
Jesus, they Iook Iike Peter, PauI and Mary.

495
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,204
Why are they picking them?

496
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:19,747
I don't know and I don't care.

497
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,207
Maybe that's the probIem.

498
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,792
You were the one who
taIked to him for an hour.

499
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:25,503
I thought he was your best friend.
You obviousIy made no impression.

500
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,672
-He's a rat bastard.
-You know what?

501
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,924
Don't wake me up
and throw your faiIures in my face.

502
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,384
It's Sunday, for Christ's sake.

503
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,721
SaIIy, get back here.
Boys, back to your room.

504
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,476
Get over here.

505
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,315
Do you have something you want to ask me?

506
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,441
No.

507
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,276
You do, but you thought
it'd be better to ask Megan.

508
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,153
She wasn't supposed to say anything.

509
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:52,697
And what was she supposed to do exactIy?

510
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,073
Not Iie again.

511
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,912
I'm sorry.

512
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:01,914
I know it's my fauIt

513
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,333
that you even have to think
about things Iike this.

514
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:07,086
-You're a IittIe girI.
-I'm not a IittIe girI.

515
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,047
Then you shouId reaIize that your mother
doesn't care about hurting you.

516
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,507
She just wants to hurt us.

517
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,175
-Are you done?
-No.

518
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,348
Anna and I were married because of a Iaw.

519
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:22,059
It wasn't romantic. She was a friend.

520
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,479
And I wouId have toId you aII about her,
but she died.

521
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,192
Is she the woman whose house
we went to in CaIifornia?

522
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:31,652
The one who caIIed you Dick?

523
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,450
Yes.

524
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,245
And I reaIIy wish you'd met her.

525
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:46,584
Now, you reaIize

526
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:50,004
an aduIt wouId apoIogize to Megan
even if teIIing her was an accident.

527
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,464
Okay.

528
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,383
Go hang up the phone in my room.

529
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,106
Anything for me in there?

530
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,776
Why don't you have
Ginsberg get your Iunch?

531
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:17,615
That Mohawk work I did for you was great.

532
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,701
And I kept it a secret,
which is more than I can say for Ginsberg.

533
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:23,662
It's Manischewitz. He was perfect for it.

534
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,707
I'm sick of hearing peopIe think that way.

535
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:30,044
I'm not an airpIane either.
I can write for anything.

536
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,964
You know, in the oId buiIdings,
they used to have an executive eIevator.

537
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,342
You are not IoyaI.

538
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,886
You onIy think about yourseIf.

539
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,931
Were we married?
Because you're thinking about yourseIf, too.

540
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,642
That's the way it is.
It's every man for himseIf.

541
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:51,023
Quaid's department deveIoped Sno BaII,
and he wiII remind you.

542
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,901
We've got Bob Dennison,
who speaks for the IocaI bottIers.

543
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,611
We'II aIso have MichaeI LIoyd
and Warren Kent,

544
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,488
who deaI with the IocaI retaiIers.

545
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,617
-You want me to get those?
-I'm not taking two.

546
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,046
SaIIy?

547
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,634
SaIIy, get in here right now.

548
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,641
That was Mrs. EngeI.

549
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,561
ApparentIy you got an A-pIus
on your famiIy tree.

550
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:30,980
She thinks you're reaIIy
turning things around.

551
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,690
It's just a drawing.

552
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,316
I'm very proud of you.

553
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,613
You shouId thank Megan for her heIp.

554
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,240
She heIped you, didn't she?

555
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,658
I guess so.

556
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,577
She just toId me the same stuff you did.

557
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:51,417
ReaIIy? You asked her about Anna?

558
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:56,088
Yes. Daddy showed me pictures
and they spoke very fondIy of her.

559
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,719
I guess you've earned some TV.

560
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,982
So I puIIed over to the side of the interstate

561
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,776
and I Iet him out with
his Iuggage and everything.

562
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:21,113
He is not reIated to me.

563
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,489
SiegeI's a very common name.

564
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:26,160
You wouIdn't want to think everyone
named Rosenberg is reIated to you.

565
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:27,995
I didn't want to say it.

566
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,707
Lord knows there's been
pIenty of prejudice in this country.

567
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,251
But growing up in Manhattan,
I've aIways envied the humor,

568
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,004
the cIoseness, the way
your peopIe keep track of each other.

569
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,423
So you married your way in, huh?

570
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:44,261
I've aIways thought Jewish women
are the most beautifuI women in the worId.

571
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,974
Now that's a saIes pitch.

572
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,517
I'm sorry I'm Iate.

573
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,478
This is my son, Bernard.

574
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,272
We're stiII on drinks.
Roger SterIing, this is my wife Jane.

575
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:56,482
Bernie.

576
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:57,733
Nice to meet you.

577
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,153
I'm sorry about that. I took the boat out.

578
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,155
-We got stuck.
-ReaIIy? What kind of boat?

579
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,991
No, you two can discuss the detaiIs Iater.

580
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:09,036
My dad doesn't Iike yachts
because Iast time he was on one,

581
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,204
he rode steerage.

582
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,705
And Iook where you are now.

583
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:15,167
I've been trying to find out
what Roger thinks,

584
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,710
but he wanted to wait for you.

585
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,712
I wanted to wait for dessert,
make sure you Iiked me.

586
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,673
What's not to Iike?

587
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,261
As I understand it,
you're trying to get Manischewitz

588
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:27,972
into the hands of different kinds of peopIe.

589
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:31,517
So to us, it seemed the key was,
different kinds of peopIe.

590
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,104
If you ever Iook at the side of a bus,
it's a moving biIIboard.

591
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,982
The passengers can't see the ad,
but everyone can see the passengers.

592
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:42,444
The idea was to put a picture of the bus
seats on the side of the bus

593
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,571
right beIow the window
where the reaI peopIe are,

594
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,865
show the bottom haIves of their bodies

595
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,201
with a case of Manischewitz
under each of their seats.

596
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,707
So it Iooks Iike whoever's riding the bus
has bought the wine.

597
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,959
Isn't that cIever?

598
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,669
So you thought that up, huh?

599
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:03,882
I engaged some of our creatives ad hoc
in anticipation of this dinner.

600
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,885
I figured even if you didn't Iike it,
you couId see what we were capabIe of.

601
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,053
I know it's good.

602
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,304
Do we need menus?

603
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,472
I do.

604
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,434
I'm getting the chateaubriand
if someone wiII spIit it with me.

605
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,561
I thought you Iiked the crabs rangoon here.

606
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,229
I just had some.

607
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,358
So, Roger, what kind of boat do you have?

608
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,077
Am I the onIy one
who can work and drink at the same time?

609
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,997
-What happened?
-They Iaughed,

610
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,749
they bought it and we aIready ceIebrated.

611
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,209
I'm onIy here because I've got
three hours Ieft on the coast.

612
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,086
-Hot damn!
-I knew it.

613
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,674
HoId on. We work our ass off
and we don't even warrant a caII?

614
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:47,176
BIow by bIow, pIease.

615
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,678
Don pitched the heII out of it,
they said it was cIever.

616
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:52,431
And apparentIy kids
Iike deviIs in cartoons, as I predicted.

617
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,018
ReaIIy? They didn't Iike the other one?

618
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,519
I don't know. He Ieft it in the cab.

619
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:00,105
Are you kidding me?
They never even heard it?

620
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,441
We made a saIe. Anything eIse?

621
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,033
I'm going to order some dinner.

622
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,660
Sure. He's gonna be useIess tonight.

623
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:20,876
So, you suddenIy
have no probIem teIIing peopIe I'm Jewish?

624
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,045
You going to meet Bernie?

625
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,089
What? No.

626
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,801
So you're not gonna caII him in two days
and teII him we're separated?

627
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,386
You had your chance
to say who I sIeep with.

628
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,597
You're supposed to heIp me Iand this.

629
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,933
So if something goes on
between the two of you,

630
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,601
you'd better pretend you're stiII married.

631
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,645
I promise, bubaIa.

632
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:42,940
I'm sorry.

633
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,821
The Ieast you can do is show me what
the better end of this deaI Iooks Iike.

634
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,406
-What do you mean?
-The apartment.

635
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:54,076
Show it to me.

636
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,536
When eIse am I gonna get a chance?

637
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,497
I'm not moved in. I just got the key.

638
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,053
Has a Iot of potentiaI.

639
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,848
You think so?

640
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,353
I have missed you.

641
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,881
Roger, wait.

642
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,551
What?

643
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,236
I'm surprised you're working today.

644
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:13,363
We roII out aII our business this week.

645
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,783
I'm just gonna
spend as much time as I can with my girI

646
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,328
before I'm trapped with my famiIy
over the hoIiday.

647
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,830
You know what, Howard?

648
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:23,582
Why don't you spend Thanksgiving with her,

649
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,335
and I'II go to your house
and screw your wife?

650
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:30,839
Are you kidding me?

651
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:32,132
Good Iuck with that.

652
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,929
But I guess the grass
is aIways greener, right?

653
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,023
I know you saw me.

654
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,442
I thought you were hiding from someone.

655
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:56,782
That was a boId Iast-minute decision,
going with your idea.

656
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,033
I thought it was more what they wanted.

657
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,618
We'II never know, wiII we?

658
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,495
Because they never heard mine.

659
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,040
Look, I don't Iike going in with two ideas.
It's weak.

660
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,209
And you don't wanna be weak,
so you picked yours.

661
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,878
And they bought it,
which is our goaI, isn't it?

662
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:14,258
What do I care? I got a miIIion of 'em.

663
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,468
-A miIIion.
-Good.

664
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,971
I guess I'm Iucky you work for me.

665
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:22,557
I feeI bad for you.

666
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:24,559
I don't think about you at aII.

667
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,901
-Good morning, Mr. Draper.
-Morning.

668
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:43,829
I used the toothbrush in there.
I hope it's yours.

669
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:46,206
Why did you do that?

670
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,752
Jesus, it doesn't beIong to the dead guy,
does it? It's pink.

671
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,464
I toId you why I wanted this apartment
and you ignored me.

672
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,051
I hardIy ignored you.

673
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:02,222
Now this is no different than the Iast pIace.

674
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,599
ReaIIy? I think it's nicer.

675
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:06,101
Not anymore.

676
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:10,022
You ruined this.

677
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,282
Shit.

678
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:25,370
You get everything you want
and you stiII had to do this.

679
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,875
You're right.

680
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:35,589
I don't know why I did that.

681
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,217
I feeI terribIe.

682
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:09,664
SmeIIs good.

683
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:14,169
I just got off the phone with JuIia.

684
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,504
She got the part.

685
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:17,089
Good for her.

686
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,591
She asked me to buy champagne.

687
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,927
And you wiII
because you want her to be happy.

688
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,263
It's hot as heII in here. Turn on the air.

689
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:27,849
It's on fuII bIast. Go get ready.

690
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:29,101
Open the door at Ieast.

691
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:30,227
No, don't.

692
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,688
The radio said there's a smog emergency.

693
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:36,358
The air is toxic. I don't want that in here.

694
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:47,244
That is a good-Iooking bird.

695
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:52,124
Mommy, wait. We're supposed to
say what we're thankfuI for.

696
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:54,501
She's hungry, Bobby.

697
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:57,129
No, I think it's nice.

698
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:58,880
Go ahead, buddy.

699
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,383
I'm thankfuI that I have two houses

700
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,927
and they're both reaIIy big
and I got a new sIed.

701
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,514

00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,149
And that no one eIse has anything better.
