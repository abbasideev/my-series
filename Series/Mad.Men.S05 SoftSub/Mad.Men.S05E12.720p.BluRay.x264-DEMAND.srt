1
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:43,793
Buongiorno, Gino.

2
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:48,214
-Mr. Covington, you're early.
-l'm not in a rush, believe me.

3
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,343
Don?

4
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:54,846
Jed, Jed Covington from Dancer.

5
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,931
Jed, nice to see you.

6
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,016
Please have a seat. l'm almost finished here.

7
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,937
Believe me, he's impossible to bother.
This is a man who won Jaguar.

8
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,105
What is that?

9
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,900
lt's like an expensive, unreliable Dodge.

10
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,193
What, they didn't go for that?

11
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:14,115
We tried writing sexy like you did,
but frankly our creative went home early.

12
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,160
Well, we'll see what's left of what we did
after working with them for a month.

13
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,621
And Peter Campbell, is that his name?

14
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:26,544
Boy, were they impressed with him.
This is a big win for your little agency.

15
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,469
So, you really eat English muffins?

16
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,387
Yes, but they're not English.

17
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:40,183
Well, to those of us at the 4A's,
everything about you is American.

18
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,726
Your sense of humor, your hard work.

19
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,063
A lot of people join
professional associations

20
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:50,401
and just use it as an excuse
to drink and hand out business cards.

21
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:52,904
Well, there has been a bit of that.

22
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:57,492
There's an unelected position
as head of our fiscal control committee.

23
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,661
We'd be honored to have you run it.

24
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,165
l'm sure there are others more deserving.

25
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,168
Who? Fifteen months
after losing Lucky Strike

26
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,505
to landing a car, you kept that place afloat.

27
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:15,009
-l suppose the world could see it that way.
-Well, the 4A's could use a little of that.

28
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:22,683
And there's a little trip to The Greenbrier
for the conference with wives or without.

29
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,812
Well, l suppose, l accept.

30
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,773
But don't expect any miracles.

31
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,858
Great. And don't be so modest.

32
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,614
Thank you, gentlemen.

33
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,032
This shouldn't be longer than an hour.

34
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,328
Scarlett,

35
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,789
you have to make sure
the freelance squatters are relocated

36
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,915
before the partners meeting.

37
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,125
Also?

38
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,294
Also there should be danish.

39
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,297
All partners present?

40
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,549
Aye.

41
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,634
Shall we begin with old business?

42
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,886
Ongoing.

43
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:03,015
lf l may begin, we've received
a confusing request from Jaguar.

44
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,226
They want to explore the idea
of going with a fee structure

45
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,811
as opposed to straight commission.

46
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,565
-ls there a difference?
-Well, it's a very interesting issue.

47
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,650
ln its most simplistic form,

48
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,236
the money we receive
for work on an account is derived

49
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,865
from the 1 5 % commission
included in our media purchases,

50
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,783
plus the markup on production costs.

51
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,119
But under a fee structure,

52
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,414
the client merely pays
for the work being done,

53
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:30,001
plus a negotiated one-and-a-half
to 2% profit.

54
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,252
Well, that is interesting.

55
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,255
The client asked for it. That's not good.

56
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,507
What if Dunlop Tires wants to do that?

57
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:41,137
That's a good hypothetical.
lf they can get it, won't everyone want it?

58
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,221
Whatever it is?

59
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,641
lt's not hypothetical.
Dunlop called last night. They'd like to meet.

60
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,393
Well, why didn't you say something?

61
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,103
l was going to wait for new business.

62
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,563
ls it new business yet?

63
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,565
l don't know.

64
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,567
What are the billings?

65
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,361
A little under a million,
including sporting goods and tubing.

66
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,196
But every Jaguar wears them.

67
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,948
So you know
they've heard good things about us.

68
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,452
lncoming calls, what a welcome sound.
Thank you, Mr. Campbell.

69
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:10,124
Shouldn't we have a vote
on the fee versus commission question?

70
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,834
l already said no.

71
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,963
Or should l leave
so you all can do whatever you want?

72
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,259
l move we tell them we'll look into it,
and then we'll look into it.

73
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,886
l second that.

74
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,138
All in favor?

75
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,309
So, more new business?
Back to ongoing business?

76
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,312
Do we have any birthdays?

77
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,484
ls there a TV there?
Tonight's WiId WiId West.

78
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,070
You guys will miss school
and you're getting to go skiing.

79
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,113
l think the WiId West is very low on that list.

80
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,574
Now put your bowl in the sink
and go get dressed.

81
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,534
Henry will be home in an hour.
l wanna beat the traffic.

82
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,498
Try these. They're the biggest ones.

83
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:54,460
l don't wanna wear someone else's shoes,
especially ski boots.

84
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,879
You know that they're sweaty.

85
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,255
Oh, my gosh!

86
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,423
Try them on.

87
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,467
Eleanor has smaller feet than me now.

88
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,219
And l'm not going skiing anyway.

89
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,846
You think you're going to sit in the lodge
and read a book? Forget it.

90
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,933
l would have rather gone to school
and come home and found you all gone.

91
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,769
ls this your plan, to ruin our ski trip?

92
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,730
l'm old enough that l can stay alone
while you go laugh your heads off.

93
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,524
Fine! l'll leave you locked in a trunk.

94
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,275
Just let me go to Daddy's.

95
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,694
Do they ever take you on vacation?

96
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:23,072
Megan and Daddy took me
to Disneyland where it's warm.

97
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,491
You want to spend
the weekend there with her

98
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,034
because she lets you do whatever you want.

99
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,161
She lets me eat whatever l want.

100
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,373
Mrs. Francis on line one.

101
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:35,960
Hello?

102
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,380
l wanted to know if you would have
any problem with me strangling Sally.

103
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,841
Should we be having
this conversation on the phone?

104
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,093
l'm not joking. She's fresh.

105
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:48,222
And l'd prefer not
to have her sour puss ruining our trip!

106
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,267
Well, if you think killing her
is the only way out of that...

107
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
We're dropping her off.

108
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,730
-Mr. Cooper here to see you.
-Send him in.

109
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,023
l'm gonna be busy all weekend.

110
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,316
lt's your child bride
she wants to spend time with.

111
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,527
Are you still asking for a favor?

112
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,695
l'm not asking.

113
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,488
We're dropping her off in an hour.

114
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,074
She can sleep
with the doorman for all l care.

115
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:14,874
l have a question l don't know
how to phrase other than as an accusation.

116
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,042
What?

117
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:19,420
l took it upon myself
to evaluate the fee issue.

118
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,965
And upon examination of our books,
l found this canceled check

119
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,010
in an unopened statement.

120
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,723
l'd ask you if you knew about it,

121
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,558
but your signature's on the check.

122
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:35,853
So it is.

123
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,481
l thought we agreed to forego bonuses.

124
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,691
-We did.
-And yet you gave him one.

125
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,070
Bert, l'll take care of it.

126
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,031
You know, you can't keep being
the good little boy

127
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,492
while the adults run this business.

128
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,628
Dawn, could you get Mr. Pryce in here?

129
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,438
You wanted to see me?

130
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:20,648
Close the door.

131
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,864
Did you hear about the 4A's?

132
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,535
l hope it's all right.
l accepted on behalf of the firm.

133
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,411
What the hell is this?

134
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,874
This.

135
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,918
l remember.

136
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,002
l didn't sign it.

137
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,798
Of course you did. Right there.

138
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,341
You want me to play detective?

139
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,094
Don, we all sign a lot of things.

140
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,262
ls this the only one?

141
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,598
l won't sit here and bear this interrogation.

142
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,975
You want a professional to do it?

143
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,025
l'm giving you a chance to come clean.

144
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,986
ls this the only one?

145
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,374
How did you get this?

146
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,630
Cooper opened the latest bank statement
and the books.

147
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,639
lt was a 1 3-day loan.

148
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,225
But then we canceled the bonuses.

149
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:42,104
You delayed them
and then you canceled them.

150
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:47,359
Then you wanted the money for Joan.
And l'm the one who's committed the crime?

151
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,278
-Are you gambling?
-No.

152
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,573
l owed taxes on my portfolio,

153
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:57,494
which l liquidated to put $50,000
into this firm after we lost Lucky Strike.

154
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,496
lf you needed it so badly,
why didn't you ask?

155
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,917
Why suffer the humiliation
for a 1 3-day loan?

156
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,045
That was my money!

157
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,927
l'm gonna need your resignation.

158
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,306
Just a moment.

159
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,268
l'm sorry and l am remorseful.

160
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:26,774
l don't know how it came to this,
but the company's in shipshape.

161
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:32,988
And l will make good by Easter,
even if l have to pull my son out of school.

162
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,867
You embezzled funds
and you forged my signature.

163
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:41,080
l apologize deeply for involving you.

164
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,460
l suppose l picked you because
you've always been the most decent to me.

165
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,297
l'm doing the most decent thing
l could possibly do, Lane.

166
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,174
l'm letting you resign.

167
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:58,597
l have never been compensated
for my contributions to this company,

168
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,433
including my role in its very existence.

169
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,563
Who would ever have dreamt
of the word "Jaguar"?

170
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:13,445
l took away nothing from P.P.L.,
while you lined your pockets.

171
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,074
And l have operated on a loss
for three years!

172
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,327
Please reconsider.

173
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,083
l'm sorry.

174
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,794
l can't trust you.

175
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,464
l'll cover the money that you owe.

176
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,219
Because 7,500 is nothing to you.

177
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,931
Do you know how the rest of us live?

178
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,435
And in the end, who's been harmed, really?

179
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,937
Can you imagine what would happen
if a client found out?

180
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,857
l'll lose my visa.

181
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,528
l can't go back to England, not like this.

182
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,032
What would l tell my wife?

183
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,201
What would l tell my son?

184
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,999
You'll tell them that it didn't work out,
because it didn't.

185
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,045
And you'll tell them
the next thing will be better,

186
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,755
because it always is.

187
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,012
Take the weekend.

188
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,598
Think of an elegant exit.

189
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:24,725
Cooper doesn't know anything.

190
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,170
l feel a bit light-headed.

191
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,255
That's relief.

192
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,260
l've started over a lot, Lane.

193
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,264
This is the worst part.

194
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,711
Were you celebrating with Don?

195
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:36,588
Celebrating?

196
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,008
Scarlett told me about
your 4A's chairmanship. Congratulations.

197
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,636
You look busy.

198
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,806
l'm thinking about
taking a vacation this Easter.

199
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,102
Where are we going?

200
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,230
Do you think there is a difference
between Bermuda and Hawaii?

201
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:57,609
Well, neither is suitable for commemorating
the death and resurrection of our Lord.

202
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,240
Can you imagine me locked in a hotel room
with a baby and my mother?

203
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,659
l suppose you'd rather l imagined you

204
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,787
bouncing in the sand
in some obscene bikini.

205
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,292
l think you should
take your party elsewhere.

206
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,796
Well, bon voyage.

207
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:08,013
l had to get up very early this morning
to go to work,

208
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,350
to make more money,
buy you more champagne.

209
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,647
Go back to bed.

210
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:24,029
She's a 25-year-old coat check girl
from Long lsland or Rhode lsland.

211
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,908
She'd never had room service before.
lt's too easy.

212
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,118
Why do we do this?

213
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,330
For the sex, but it's always disappointing.

214
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,040
For me, anyway.

215
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,917
l don't like what we're doing.

216
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,585
So you're drinking with a purpose.

217
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,921
l'm tired of this piddly shit.

218
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,508
l'm tired of living in this delusion
that we're going somewhere

219
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,426
when we can't even give
Christmas bonuses.

220
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,805
What about your speech
about how we were arriving and so forth?

221
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,432
Or we've arrived?
l don't remember, but it was good.

222
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:53,892
So you feel different since Jaguar?

223
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,894
-We're getting incoming calls.
-Pete is.

224
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,854
Look, l don't like him,
but he's kind of turned things around.

225
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,064
He still thinks small.

226
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,943
Dunlop's another Topaz.
lt's another Mohawk.

227
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,319
lt's another coat check girl.

228
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,946
-So you don't want it?
-No.

229
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,448
l don't want Jaguar, l want Chevy.

230
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,202
l don't want Mohawk, l want American.
l don't want Dunlop, l want Firestone.

231
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,913
Don't yell at me. l'd love to have Firestone.

232
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,707
l spent the night
at the American Cancer Society

233
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,208
with my hand in Jim Barton's pocket

234
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,210
and you told me l was wasting my time.
You told me he was dead.

235
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,379
Because Ed Baxter told me
the Lucky Strike letter

236
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,922
poisoned us with all those companies.

237
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,924
What? Why didn't you tell me that?

238
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,136
Because l wrote that letter.

239
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,431
You let that wax figurine discourage you?

240
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,934
Why didn't you just ask me?
l'll get you a meeting with Firestone.

241
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,604
-lt doesn't mean it's not true.
-Jesus, Don.

242
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,565
You used to love "no."
"No" used to make you hard.

243
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,859
And whether you admit it or not,
things have changed.

244
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,154
You just beat out two huge firms
for that shitty car account.

245
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:51,575
Caroline, get me James Barton
at Firestone Tires.

246
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,455
No, get Ed Baxter.

247
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,748
Let that go.

248
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:01,627
What's Dow Chemical bill? 20 million?
lt's about the same size as Lucky Strike.

249
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,213
l'm telling you, Ed Baxter is Moby Dick.
There are easier whales.

250
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,633
So you can't get me a meeting.
They're three buildings away.

251
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:08,925
Look, l'm sure he'll meet with you.

252
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,554
Even if it's just to watch you eat shit,
but it's complicated.

253
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,097
What about Kenny?

254
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,725
ln case you've forgotten, he's squeamish
about working with his family.

255
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:18,894
Then fire him.

256
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,823
Hi!

257
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,408
What are you doing here?

258
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,619
My dad didn't even tell you, did he?

259
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,665
l'm spending the weekend here
because l didn't wanna go skiing.

260
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,626
l thought you'd be excited.

261
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,545
l just didn't know.
What's wrong with skiing?

262
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,632
l hate her so much. She's such a phony.

263
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,884
You know that's not true.

264
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,594
Can we have tea?

265
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,224
Go ahead and put the water out.

266
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,189
Sorry l'm late.

267
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,359
l don't mind waiting 20 minutes
for an unspecified meeting with my boss.

268
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,028
l mean, it's not like
your imagination would run wild.

269
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,075
So we're going after your father-in-law.

270
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,953
l see.

271
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,579
Well, l've told you before,
l can't help with that.

272
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,747
That's what l'm counting on.

273
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:22,874
What the hell does that mean?

274
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,419
We want the business
and it has nothing to do with you.

275
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,503
And we'd like to keep it that way,

276
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,089
since you'd prefer not to jeopardize
your relationship with your wife.

277
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:35,220
So what do you think's gonna happen
when Ed calls me the minute you call him?

278
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,764
l don't know.

279
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:44,187
l suppose you could not answer the phone.
You might be having a drink with your boss.

280
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,191
That's very smart.

281
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,612
l guess there's nothing
l can do to muck it up now.

282
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:54,614
What the hell does that mean?

283
00:17:56,117 --> 00:18:00,036
Well, l'd hate to bring it up with Cynthia,
even by accident.

284
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,832
Look at you.

285
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,085
What would it take for you to do nothing?

286
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,963
Some kind of partnership,
assuming it works out?

287
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,592
No, l don't want to be your partner.
l've seen what's involved.

288
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:21,641
All l need is a promise
that if you get it, you'll force me on it.

289
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:23,977
Okay.

290
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,229
You really fought us.

291
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,148
And two other things.

292
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:33,278
Pete doesn't go to the meeting
and Pete doesn't go to any meetings.

293
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,994
As you were.

294
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:55,717
Where are you coming from?

295
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,511
Hemisphere Club.

296
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,015
l've got good news. l talked to Ed.

297
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,476
-What did he say?
-That he'll see you Monday morning.

298
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,812
Monday? Are you kidding me?

299
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,608
You said to get you a meeting.
l got you a meeting.

300
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:16,571
You think this is a serious meeting,
giving me 48 hours to prepare?

301
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,864
l think that's up to you.

302
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,870
Don't lose your nerve.
l like that guy l saw today. l missed him.

303
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,383
When did you get here?

304
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,219
After lunch.
They couldn't wait to get rid of me.

305
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,430
-Where's Megan?
-Taking a nap.

306
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,146
l love when you surprise me.

307
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,439
l forgot about it.

308
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,025
Well, don't forget Betty's not coming home
until Monday afternoon,

309
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,902
so you can drive her out to school
Monday morning.

310
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,988
l have a meeting. You'll have to do it.

311
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,532
l have an audition.
l'm gonna be gone all morning.

312
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,828
Sally, you'll be here alone Monday morning.

313
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,288
Megan's got plans until lunch.

314
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,039
-l have school.
-Not anymore.

315
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,708
Turn off the damn TV.

316
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:13,587
Anything else?

317
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,839
You don't even call me?

318
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,173
Do you know how insulting it is,

319
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,426
the assumption
that l have nothing else to do?

320
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,511
l had to fire Lane today.

321
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,430
What?

322
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,099
What happened?

323
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,522
He stole money from the company.

324
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,941
He seems so honest.

325
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,068
Why would he do that?

326
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,653
What's the difference?

327
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,115
lt's all just gossip at a certain point.

328
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,241
You can't tell anyone.

329
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,662
ls the firm okay?

330
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,706
We'll be fine.

331
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,876
Did you eat orjust drink?

332
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:54,586
l'm not hungry.

333
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:58,173
Well, you're gonna have dinner
with your daughter.

334
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,634
-l have a lot of work to do.
-So do l.

335
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,177
After dinner.

336
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,309
What are you doing there?

337
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,769
We're going to dinner.

338
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,395
No, dear.

339
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,398
We're going to celebrate. More, obviously.

340
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,150
No, damn it.

341
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,569
What's gotten into you?

342
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,405
l've had a dreadful day, dear.

343
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,158
Not all of it.

344
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:29,496
l'm tired of you refusing
to recognize the successes when they come.

345
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,501
l know your work is unpleasant sometimes,
but l'm very proud of you.

346
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,379
You're very kind.

347
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:41,091
You obviously had a good day
that turned into a bad day

348
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,801
and you drank too much.

349
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,429
But you came home to me on time.

350
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,932
Now you're taking me to dinner.

351
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,475
No arguments.

352
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,692
Can't we just take a cab?

353
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,031
l thought racing green.

354
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:21,006
-How did you get this?
-l wrote a check.

355
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:25,051
l hope you're not cross. You know what?
l don't care if you are.

356
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,886
You never spend on yourself.

357
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:30,515
lt's always about my travel
or Nigel's schooling.

358
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,810
And l told the salesman you were a partner
at the car's advertising agency

359
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,354
and he gave me a very fair price.

360
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,442
Come, let's take a little drive.

361
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,236
lt's lovely.

362
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,697
Go on, sit in it.

363
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:53,163
Oh, dear. You really did overdo it.

364
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,753
Okay, found it.

365
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,338
You sure you don't wanna come?

366
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,175
He wants to work. Look at him.

367
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,053
He's got a big meeting tomorrow.
He'll be miserable.

368
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,559
You girls have fun.

369
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,362
lt's cleared up.

370
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,783
You could just go round the block
if you're still not feeling steady.

371
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,493
l've work to do.

372
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,369
l don't understand you.

373
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:36,790
Are you really going
to spend your whole weekend working?

374
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,125
Don't you like your present?

375
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:44,714
l love the car and l love you so much,
but l don't feel right driving it

376
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,468
until l've taken care of
some of these errands l've let go.

377
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,304
There'll be plenty of time, dear.

378
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:57,393
You got sick from drink again yesterday.
Why do you continue?

379
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,979
lt's cognac. lt settles the stomach.

380
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:04,651
Well, finish up and then we'll go for a drive.

381
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,656
l don't think there's really anything to see.

382
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,201
l was telling Sally about my plan
to ensnare David.

383
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,578
Either way, Carter's gonna wanna
rehearse with you alone.

384
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:16,704
Can l get some coffee?

385
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,373
l'll have some, too.

386
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:19,999
He's not gonna bring you coffee.

387
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:23,878
Georgy Girl,

388
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,756
Alfie, Gambit,

389
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,759
Night of the Generals, Blow-up?

390
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:32,011
Anything without abortions
or foreigners in it?

391
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:34,848
Let's see. Fistful of Dollars.

392
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,851
l think your father would kill me
if l see that without him.

393
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,979
So, l don't understand.
Do you like David or Carter?

394
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:44,232
Well, Carter likes me.
Do you know what he said to me?

395
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:48,361
l can't believe l didn't tell you this.
He asked if l was a redhead everywhere.

396
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,029
Stop! Okay?

397
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,991
No, it's okay. l have a boyfriend.

398
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,618
-Since when?
-A while.

399
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,787
But l don't know if he likes me that way.

400
00:24:57,872 --> 00:24:59,414
Then he's not a boyfriend.

401
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,042
A lot of great romances
start out as friendships.

402
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:08,882
A boyfriend's a person
that makes you feel special.

403
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,552
A person that knows you.
And holding hands is plenty.

404
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:22,020
-You should see if you can get a drink.
-l don't want a drink.

405
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,791
-Are you using the lodge phone?
-No.

406
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:10,169
l told Betty and Henry
to take their ski vacation and shove it.

407
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,506
-Are you stuck with Bluto again?
-No, l'm at Megan's.

408
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,008
That's better, l bet.

409
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,928
Actually, l'm gonna be
all alone tomorrow morning.

410
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,179
Wanna come visit me?

411
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,431
Really?

412
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:22,640
You can take the train.

413
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,100
lt's not that easy.

414
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,728
l've gotta sneak off campus,
which is serious.

415
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:30,189
Plus, it's a 20-minute bike ride to the station
and then two hours on the train.

416
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,816
Forget it.

417
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,444
For a year you've been saying
how much you wanted to visit me.

418
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,195
Are we ever gonna see each other?

419
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,906
All right.

420
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,617
The earliest l can get
to Grand Central is 8:30.

421
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,620
l'm gonna have to work on my paper tonight
to get it typed tomorrow.

422
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,457
783 Park, apartment 1 7B.

423
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,375
l gotta get a pen.

424
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,824
Do your homework, don't use the juicer,
and l'll be home around 1 :00.

425
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,576
The first thing l'm gonna do is feel that TV.

426
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:26,079
-Break a leg.
-Thanks.

427
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,009
You gonna tell me
what you're gonna talk about

428
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:42,845
or is my look of surprise
part of the sales pitch?

429
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,263
l don't want it to sound rehearsed.

430
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,141
No danger of that.

431
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,687
Just go in there and keep your cool.

432
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,607
But if he baits you,
l want you to punch him in the balls.

433
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,153
-What happened to your enlightenment?
-l don't know.

434
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,532
lt wore off.

435
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:05,118
Just a minute.

436
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:18,131
Hey.

437
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,799
Come in.

438
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,219
You didn't check the peephole.

439
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,306
l knew it was you, silly.
The doorman sent you up.

440
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,310
-You don't look that different.
-Well, you do.

441
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,982
What do you think?

442
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,653
There's a kid at school
whose parents have one better than this.

443
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,488
lt has a second floor.

444
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,701
-What do you wanna do?
-Are you kidding?

445
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,744
The museum's right across the park.

446
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,539
We don't go across the park.
There's bums on the other side.

447
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,458
l've got money for a cab.

448
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,710
Okay. Let me get my jacket.

449
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:05,386
How'd they get all these animals?

450
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,972
Teddy Roosevelt killed them.

451
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,683
Do you think they were a family?

452
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,852
l hope so. Otherwise, what were they doing?

453
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,606
Walking around saying,
"We just need a baby to finish this diorama."

454
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,987
There's this kid, Anderson, he's a senior.

455
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,948
He keeps picking fights with me
and he's twice my size.

456
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,200
What a jerk.

457
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:32,288
All the senior lacrosse guys
peed in my locker.

458
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,208
They ruined my jersey.
They're a bunch of sadists.

459
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:39,378
Henry got picked on when he was little,
and now he runs a city.

460
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,797
That's true.

461
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,804
l keep wishing he would leave her.
l know it's wrong. l feel really bad.

462
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,599
Don't. You can't make it happen.

463
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,313
Just so you know,
l could get in trouble, too,

464
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,940
but l really wanted to see you.

465
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,025
Yeah, l can't believe l almost didn't come.

466
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,237
My stomach hurts.

467
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,906
Maybe you're hungry. Want some caribou?

468
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,203
Listen,

469
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,705
l feel kind of bad.

470
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,043
They were teasing me
and l might have told them

471
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,255
that l was coming to the city
to do it with you.

472
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:25,758
Really?

473
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,010
Yeah.

474
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:31,055
They don't know how old you are.
l hope that's okay.

475
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:37,687
You can say whatever you want, but l...

476
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,064
l'm not sure that's the way l like you.

477
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,857
Yeah, good.

478
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:47,113
Yeah. l always think that you're
like my little sister, except smart.

479
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,157
You have a mustache.

480
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,911
l usually shave on Sunday night.
l didn't think you'd care.

481
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,454
l don't like it.

482
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,378
l really don't feel well. l'll be right back.

483
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,630
Okay. Meet me in Africa.

484
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,152
Mr. Baxter will see you now.
You can leave your coats.

485
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,323
An hour and 45 minutes.

486
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,992
Better than l thought.

487
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:41,292
This is Tom Schafer, director of marketing.
Jack Schmidt, head of household.

488
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,419
-Roger Sterling.
-Don Draper.

489
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,263
Ed, you said they were gonna
bring your son-in-law.

490
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:56,182
Ken knows better.

491
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,559
So, Don, what's so urgent?

492
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,853
l didn't say urgent. l said imminent.

493
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,605
Well, Ed, l wanna talk about your business.

494
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,190
What about it?

495
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:06,192
See, l've been looking at what you're doing

496
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:07,943
and l think you're in
desperate need of change.

497
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,196
-And you're just the guy to do it.
-l am.

498
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,366
Are you still the guy who wrote that letter?

499
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,909
l don't wanna hear about that letter again.

500
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,827
Do you know how hard we fought
to save that account?

501
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,788
And they stabbed us first, believe me.

502
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:20,998
And nobody's gonna wanna be
in the cigarette business.

503
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,333
The government's in the process
of killing it.

504
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,793
So you're vindictive?

505
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,295
Not as vindictive as you, apparently.

506
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,214
l had a feeling
this is what this was all about.

507
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:30,758
lt's not. This is about your business.

508
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,260
Well, we appreciate that,
but we're very happy with MacManus.

509
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,679
l'm sure they're very happy with you.

510
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,514
But you don't owe them anything.

511
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,474
All they have to do
is keep running the same work.

512
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,226
You're on the back burner over there,

513
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,978
subsidizing all the great creative work
they're doing

514
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,231
and paying for new business lunches.

515
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:47,775
As soon as you walk away,
that place will fold up like a tent.

516
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,778
We're at 50 % market share
in almost everything we make.

517
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:54,532
Because you have a big line
of diverse and charismatic products.

518
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:58,327
And you keep making more,
Ziptape, Styrofoam, Rovana.

519
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,162
And why do you do that?

520
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:03,833
Because even though success is a reality,
its effects are temporary.

521
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,251
You get hungry,
even though you've just eaten.

522
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,422
At the old firm,
we had London Fog raincoats.

523
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:13,342
We had a year where we sold 81 %
of the raincoats in the United States.

524
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:14,468
Name another raincoat.

525
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:18,222
But we didn't stop working for them
because 81 % isn't enough.

526
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,099
Tell me about napalm.

527
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,727
You mean that stuff those kids
outside your building are screaming about?

528
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,188
Napalm was invented in 1 942.

529
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:28,983
The government put
it in flamethrowers against the Nazis,

530
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,568
impact bombs against the Japanese.

531
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:34,321
lt was all over Korea. l was there.
And now it's in Vietnam.

532
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,783
But the important thing is
when our boys are fighting and they need it,

533
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,995
when America needs it,
Dow makes it and it works.

534
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,625
But it doesn't change the fact
that we're happy with our agency.

535
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,128
Are you? You're happy with 50%?

536
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,838
You're on top and you don't have enough.

537
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,424
You're happy
because you're successful for now.

538
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,717
But what is happiness?

539
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,886
lt's a moment
before you need more happiness.

540
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,555
l won't settle for 50% of anything.
l want 1 00 %.

541
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,433
You're happy with your agency?
You're not happy with anything.

542
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:07,271
You don't want most of it. You want all of it.
And l won't stop until you get all of it.

543
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:10,733
Thank you for your time.

544
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:14,320
Thank you for stopping by.

545
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:24,830
l'll buy you a drink
if you wipe the blood off your mouth.

546
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:37,676
Sally?

547
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,389
Sally!

548
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,600
What's going on?

549
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,394
She just pulled up in a cab with a $25 fare.

550
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,521
l got it.

551
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,858
Sally? Let me in.

552
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,568
ls Henry out there?

553
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,029
No. Let me in.

554
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,704
l got my... My period started
and l didn't know what to do.

555
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,918
l just wanted to come home.

556
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:15,464
lt's okay. We'll take care of it.

557
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,928
lt's okay, sweetheart.

558
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,349
lt's okay.

559
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,772
l'm sorry to bother you,
but can l leave these here?

560
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,232
Why?

561
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,568
Mr. Pryce hasn't come in yet
and his door is locked,

562
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,112
and l don't feel comfortable
with the company's records

563
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,613
parked on the edge of my desk.

564
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,156
Just leave them.

565
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,995
Please tell him
to call me the minute he gets back.

566
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,580
Thank you, Dawn.

567
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,715
-Can l help you?
-ls Sally here?

568
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,884
She's not. Who are you?

569
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,928
l'm Glen. l left my bag here.

570
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,346
Do you know where she is?

571
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:05,973
No. l just asked you.

572
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,766
What is going on? What are you doing here?

573
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,351
l don't know, okay?

574
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,687
We went to the museum
and she said she wasn't feeling well,

575
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,938
and then she just took off.

576
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,774
l looked for her and finally just thought,
maybe she came back here.

577
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,276
l just need my bag, okay?

578
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,986
Calm down.

579
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,077
-When was this?
-l don't know.

580
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:29,997
l was at the museum for a long time.

581
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,916
l really looked for her.

582
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,960
l didn't do anything. l just want my bag.

583
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,755
l would have left it,
but l've got a book on Nat Turner in there

584
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,048
and my paper's due tomorrow.

585
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,884
Don't move.

586
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,889
-Hello?
-Yes, Megan.

587
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,892
l was just calling to say
if you or Don were wondering where Sally is,

588
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,018
she found her way home.

589
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,103
Thank God.

590
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,189
l just found out or l would have called.

591
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,567
What happened?

592
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,277
Well...

593
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,031
She became a woman today. She started.

594
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,995
l think she just needed her mother.

595
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,666
No, of course.

596
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,251
Well, let her know that l'm glad she's okay.

597
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,544
l will.

598
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,424
What happened?

599
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,593
She wasn't feeling well.

600
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:26,512
-Was that Betty?
-Yes.

601
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:32,935
Where are you going?

602
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,104
To Grand Central
to get the train back to school.

603
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:38,065
l've already lost one kid today.
l'll put you on the train.

604
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,568
Well, it doesn't leave until 7:00.

605
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:49,660
Look, just wait here, finish your paper.
l'll take you later.

606
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,290
Do you want something to eat?

607
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,042
lf you don't mind.

608
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:23,902
What's going on?

609
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,740
l think something's
terribly wrong in Mr. Pryce's office.

610
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,241
l can't get the door open.

611
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,753
Dear Lord.

612
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,101
Jesus.

613
00:39:58,897 --> 00:39:59,980
Here.

614
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,026
Are you feeling better?

615
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,445
-l'm so embarrassed.
-Don't be.

616
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:10,532
And if you ever get in trouble like that again,
just ask another woman.

617
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:11,950
They'll understand.

618
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,411
Oh, gosh, l don't wanna talk about it.

619
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:16,622
Move over. l wanna lie down.

620
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:28,467
There's a lot of responsibilities,
but that's what being a woman is.

621
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,470
And when it happens every month,

622
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,305
even though it's unpleasant,

623
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,557
it means everything's working.

624
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:40,312
lt means everything's ready for a baby
when you want one.

625
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:46,151
And maybe you'll have a beautiful girl
and you can tell her all this.

626
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,500
Well, l'll tell you one thing,
if they haven't called the agency,

627
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,168
they probably called the men in white coats.

628
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:04,795
Hello?

629
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,558
l think you should sit down.

630
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,101
What's going on?

631
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,104
Lane hanged himself in his office.

632
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,856
What?

633
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,283
Cooper sent everybody home.

634
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:37,161
Told them there was a building emergency.
Nobody knows.

635
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,456
What the hell happened?

636
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,041
Who knows?

637
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,544
Come on, l'm taking you home.

638
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,046
No, l wanna wait.

639
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,548
For what?

640
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,384
We're waiting for the coroner
to cut him down and take him away.

641
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,140
What, he's still in there?
We can't leave him like that.

642
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,482
They said not to disturb the body.

643
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,401
-lt's a crime scene.
-Come on.

644
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,737
We can't leave him like that.

645
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,963
Get something to cut him down.

646
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,514
Here, cut.

647
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:45,896
Jesus.

648
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:10,295
Come on.

649
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,348
Let's go.

650
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:33,902
"To my fellow partners."

651
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:36,280
Open it.

652
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,624
lt's a resignation letter.

653
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,170
lt's boilerplate.

654
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,112
What are you doing home?

655
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:22,200
Hello, Mr. Draper.

656
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:23,827
Who are you?

657
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,456
This is Glen. He's Sally's friend.
He's waiting for his train.

658
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:28,832
Where's Sally?

659
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,376
She went home. l'll explain later.

660
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:34,963
l don't understand. l gotta lie down.

661
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:36,423
We've met before.

662
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,009
l used to live down the street in Ossining.

663
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,635
You know my mother, Helen Bishop?

664
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,263
Oh, right.

665
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,265
l should just go.

666
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,392
And sit in Grand Central until 7:00?

667
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,894
l'll be fine.

668
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,062
Where are you headed?

669
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:53,523
l go to Hotchkiss. lt's up in Lakeville.
lt's a couple of hours away.

670
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,068
That's fine. Let's go.

671
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,444
Are you sure?

672
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,071
Yes.

673
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:03,492
Are you okay?

674
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,036
l had a bad day. We can talk about it later.

675
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,998
Thank you very much
for your hospitality, Megan.

676
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:12,084
lt was very nice to meet you.

677
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,642
Why does everything turn out crappy?

678
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,477
What do you mean?

679
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:34,231
l don't know.

680
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:36,691
Everything you wanna do,

681
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,488
everything you think is gonna
make you happy just turns to crap.

682
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:44,032
You're too young to talk that way.

683
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,784
But it's true.

684
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:54,876
What do you wanna do?

685
00:45:56,838 --> 00:46:00,799
lf you could do anything,
what would you do?
