1
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,545
Did you eat my pack of vioIet candy?

2
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,547
What?

3
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,173
It's purpIe and siIver.

4
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:51,718
Don gave it to me
before a presentation once.

5
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,761
-No.
-I need it.

6
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,764
-So you'II buy another one.
-That's not the same.

7
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,433
Don't be such a strict CathoIic.

8
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,435
I'II buy one for you and I'II say a brucha.

9
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,980
How about tonight
we go see that stupid movie

10
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,190
about the guy being hunted in Africa?

11
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:09,318
-The Naked Prey.
-I don't know, Abe.

12
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,612
You're gonna resist the chance
to see CorneI WiIde naked?

13
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:14,365
I heard he wrestIes a boa constrictor.
Sounds pretty dirty.

14
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,325
I can't think beyond my presentation.

15
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,661
There's aIways speciaI circumstances.

16
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,622
That's not true.

17
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,541
I've been working on Heinz for months.

18
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:27,295
You know what you want?
You want to take me to work with you,

19
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:30,214
and stick me in a drawer
and open it whenever you get bored.

20
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,468
Fine. You don't want to
see each other anymore?

21
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,553
Jesus!

22
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,305
You aIways want
to push the button on the whoIe thing.

23
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,641
I come aII the way up here to make Iove.

24
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:44,228
HaIf the time, you don't want to
and then you just do it to get it over with.

25
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,147
It's just hard when I come right from work.

26
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,982
I need a second when I waIk in the door.

27
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,068
-You sound Iike my dad.
-Fine.

28
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:54,405
We'II go to the movies. I just can't promise
that my mind won't be eIsewhere.

29
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,199
Your mind is aIways eIsewhere.

30
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,409
Why are you doing this right now?

31
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:01,829
Most men wouIdn't even
have this conversation. They'd just Ieave.

32
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,873
And why wouId they do that?

33
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,543
I'm your boyfriend, not a focus group.

34
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,712
Have a shitty day.

35
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,177
I don't know. Can't you make it tiII Friday?

36
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,430
Because today is not a good day.

37
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:22,350
This conversation went in a circIe
and we're back where we started.

38
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,268
The answer is no.

39
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,647
Yeah, me, too.

40
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,065
I just had the same conversation.

41
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,234
No, I think they were different
because yours was private.

42
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:33,778
Sorry I'm Iate.

43
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,988
There's no pIace to pee in this city.

44
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,324
-She just got here.
-Then why are you giving me a hard time?

45
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,369
We had the funniest thing
outside our buiIding.

46
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:45,039
A bunch of students with backpacks
asked us how to get to Broadway.

47
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,625
What's so funny about that, Jethro?

48
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,586
It's Iike the campaign.
We couId have cast it right there and then.

49
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:55,424
-Megan, can I have a moment?
-Sure.

50
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,552
-She goes to casting now?
-I guess so.

51
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,262
She's kind of been my junior on this.

52
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,640
I was buying dinner
Iast night for this Iarge-breasted girI

53
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,142
who caIIs herseIf SaIome,
and she's Iooking at the menu,

54
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:09,021
ridicuIing this Grandma Moses drawing
and she's baIIs-out funny.

55
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,149
But I ignore her because aII I can think of

56
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:15,236
is I'II never be abIe to draw
as weII as a photograph.

57
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,285
Oh, thank God.

58
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,453
I couIdn't take one more omen of doom.

59
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,038
I'm sorry.
We're gonna have to miss the presentation.

60
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,833
We have to head upstate
for Howard Johnson's.

61
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,419
-ReaIIy?
-You're running the show.

62
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,879
How does me sitting there change anything?

63
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,381
Howard Johnson's, huh?

64
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,009
I Iove the coIors, the atmosphere,

65
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,219
-the cIams.
-She's never been to one.

66
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,599
I'm reaIIy sorry.

67
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,143
No, we have aII your work, I guess.

68
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,937
I'II check in from the road. Get your stuff.

69
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,237
Break a Ieg.

70
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,158
-WeII, that's a disaster.
-Don't Iisten to him.

71
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,743
That's a vote of confidence.

72
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,828
Give me one of those.

73
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,293
The fire is primaI.

74
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:17,465
These kids, they aII come there aIone,

75
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,427
and gathered in a circIe,
they suddenIy feeI incIuded.

76
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:27,350
They're safe from whatever is out there
in the night, in the darkness.

77
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:33,522
It's the beans that brought them together
on that cooI night at the end of the summer.

78
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,867
I wish someone was eating beans.

79
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,827
That guy is.

80
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,663
I did ask for coIIege students.

81
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,623
I know that, Raymond.

82
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,750
And we want you to have
everything you asked for.

83
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:57,171
WeII, stop writing down what I asked for
and try to figure out what I want.

84
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,633
Raymond, I saw you when she was taIking.

85
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,094
-You were off somewhere.
-It's very sentimentaI.

86
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,512
I have that memory.

87
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,639
That's for me. That's not for kids.

88
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:10,017
Kids have memories.

89
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:14,105
And so do the homemakers
who make a home with Heinz.

90
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,023
Raymond, can you see
how passionate she is?

91
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:19,735
Photography wiII reaIIy capture the fun
on their faces. And the gIow.

92
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,154
Did Don sign off on this?

93
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,323
Don Ioves this work.

94
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,326
Maybe Don doesn't understand
what you wanted either.

95
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,619
Let's not speak for Don.

96
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:31,122
I'm sorry.
I'm not a word person Iike you peopIe.

97
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,665
Sure, you are.

98
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,251
And your words are aIways, "I don't Iike it."

99
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,463
And I think you're right.
We don't understand you.

100
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,632
Because you do Iike it.

101
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,092
I think you just Iike fighting.

102
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,427
Peggy, you're being oversensitive.

103
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:50,933
Do you know how often peopIe come in here
and Iook at work and feeI something?

104
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,977
AImost never.

105
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,021
You have to run with this.

106
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,565
It's young and it's beautifuI.

107
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,776
And no one eIse is gonna figure out
how to say that about beans.

108
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,488
Can you beIieve this girI?

109
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,408
I don't know. Can you?

110
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:13,205
Miss, you're Iucky that I have a daughter
or I wouIdn't be so understanding.

111
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,501
Raymond, they're frustrated,
but they're not through.

112
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,130
I'm frustrated, too.

113
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,760
-It's cIose, I guess.
-It's damn cIose.

114
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,137
Why don't just you and I
have dinner tonight?

115
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,931
Maybe take in a show?
Take your mind off things?

116
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,017
You can try.

117
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,985
I've got to admire you.

118
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,322
That was a compIeteIy suicidaI move.

119
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,782
Women usuaIIy want to pIease.

120
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,409
Give me sketches of the taIking beans.

121
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,369
I'II write new diaIog.

122
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,086
-You're off the business.
-What'd he say?

123
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,796
He said you're off the business.

124
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,314
Everyone has somewhere to go today.

125
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,941
I'm going to the movies.

126
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,651
Very good.

127
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,995
One of them gave Sam a first-class scratch.

128
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,915
Not very good-tempered, are they?

129
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,583
Well, neither are you when you're hungry.

130
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,460
l don't suppose you've fed them.

131
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,504
No, l can't say l have.

132
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,423
You didn't pack any lion's milk
for me before I Ieft.

133
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,800
You didn't ask me.

134
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,512
You're going to get in troubIe.

135
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,682
Want some?

136
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,477
Sure. What the heII.

137
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,526
Come on.

138
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,367
-HeIIo.
-Hi.

139
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,994
But why don't they?

140
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,704
lt's at least two days since they've eaten.

141
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,372
-They'll just die.
-Yes, l know.

142
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,875
lt must be the formula.
We haven't hit on it yet.

143
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,501
We'll just have to try again.

144
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,129
Right, back to the drawing board.

145
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,506
-Formula...
-Thirteen.

146
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,139
Oh, George, l've just been thinking
about the cod-liver oil.

147
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,898
She's not gonna make it out there
on her own.

148
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,150
You've got to keep it down.

149
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,236
Okay.

150
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,198
Aren't you worried?

151
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,163
It'II turn out aII right.

152
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,679
That evening, we suffered
all the agony of parents

153
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,098
whose teenage daughter
is out on her first date.

154
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,350
No.

155
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,940
Just watch the movie.

156
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,197
We returned the next day only to find Elsa

157
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,075
minus both the young lion and her food.

158
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,507
I toId you a dozen sometimes
I was coming in.

159
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,133
And I said no, you're not coming in.

160
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,593
'Cause you don't want I shouId see you?

161
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,345
You see me at home, for Christ's sake.

162
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,138
You stare at me when I'm sIeeping.

163
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,598
I don't want to see you anyway.

164
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,725
-I just want to use the photocopy.
-For what?

165
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,727
I'm buiIding my case.

166
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,562
Again?

167
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,773
Who's this?

168
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,318
I'm Peggy OIson. I work with Ginsberg.

169
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,862
WeII, I'm the originaI.

170
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,323
Okay. It's bedtime.

171
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,398
Miss OIson.

172
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,489
-What time is it?
-It's 8:30.

173
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,824
Mr. Draper's on the phone.

174
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,039
I'II take it in here. You can go.

175
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,332
Good night.

176
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,506
-HeIIo?
-Dawn didn't get any caIIs.

177
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,591
Did you get any caIIs?

178
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,385
-About what?
-Has anyone caIIed you?

179
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,387
I don't think so.

180
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,681
Okay.

181
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,976
Listen, it didn't go weII.

182
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,063
-l've got to go.
-I take fuII responsibiIity.

183
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,398
HeIIo?

184
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,332
Why didn't you teII me you had a famiIy?

185
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:52,378
-Your father's nice.
-He's not my reaI father.

186
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,088
PeopIe don't understand.

187
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,673
-Are you adopted?
-ActuaIIy, I'm from Mars.

188
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,678
It's fine if you don't beIieve me,
but that's where I'm from.

189
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,264
I'm a fuII-bIooded Martian.

190
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,894
Don't worry.
There's no pIot to take over Earth.

191
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,647
We're just dispIaced.

192
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,108
Okay.

193
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,527
I can teII you don't beIieve me.

194
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,530
That's okay. We're a big secret.

195
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,157
They even tried to hide it from me.

196
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,577
That man, my father,

197
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,705
toId me a story
I was born in a concentration camp,

198
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,124
but, you know, that's impossibIe.

199
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,212
And I never met my mother
because she supposedIy died there.

200
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,256
That's convenient.

201
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,551
Next thing I know, Morris there
finds me in a Swedish orphanage.

202
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,886
I was five. I remember it.

203
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,139
That's incredibIe.

204
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,057
Yeah.

205
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,810
And then I got this one communication.

206
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,979
A simpIe order.

207
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,232
"Stay where you are."

208
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,653
Are there others Iike you?

209
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,780
I don't know.

210
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,492
I haven't been abIe to find any.

211
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,397
-HeIIo?
-Hi. It's me.

212
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,108
You at work?

213
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,860
No, I'm home.

214
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,822
Come up here.

215
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,034
You need me, huh?

216
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,495
I aIways need you.

217
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,456
What happened?

218
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,876
This guy toId me
the strangest thing at work today.

219
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,128
Yeah?

220
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,715
He said he was born
in a concentration camp.

221
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,675
But that's impossibIe, right?

222
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,595
It happened.

223
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,432
-Come up here.
-Okay.

224
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,309
Hurry.

225
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,409
I'm going to go in there
and sit down with the door cIosed.

226
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,703
And I want you to buzz me
when he comes in.

227
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,249
One buzz for Don,
two buzzes for Mr. and Mrs.

228
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,471
-Who died?
-Let's pIay hooky.

229
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,014
ShouId I cIose the door?

230
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,809
Remember when we used to represent
doubIe-sided aIuminum?

231
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,186
I remember twins and a hospitaI.

232
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,604
Not that part.

233
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,190
Bob Whozit's moved over
to Howard Johnson's

234
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,733
to heIp them with their new modeIs.

235
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:07,239
So how about a compIeteIy debauched
and unnecessary fact-finding boondoggIe

236
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,991
to the fIagship in

237
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,827
PIattsburgh, New York?

238
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,955
Just an hour from scenic Lake PIacid.

239
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,665
Are you kidding me?

240
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,375
Did you ever hear the one
about the farmer's daughter?

241
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,168
This is where it aII takes pIace.

242
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,630
-No.
-Don, come on.

243
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,134
AIone, I'm an escapee
from some expensive mentaI institution.

244
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:30,387
But the two of us,
we're a coupIe of rich, handsome perverts.

245
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,473
-I Iove Howard Johnson's.
-We'II try and stop by.

246
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,059
I think MontreaI is an hour away.

247
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,021
Look, the whoIe point of going
is to forget about her.

248
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,815
I mean, I'm supposed to have dinner
with Jane's snooty friends,

249
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,984
sit around taIking about Frank LIoyd Rice.

250
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,653
I aIways say it that way. They hate it.

251
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,114
You know what?

252
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,951
-I'm gonna take Megan.
-ReaIIy?

253
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,786
You can bring Jane.

254
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,538
Megan gets aIong with everyone.

255
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,498
You're very funny. Forget it.

256
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,334
NewIyweds.

257
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,044
I'II give Dawn the guy's name.

258
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:11,470
Dawn, I need you to get me out of everything
through the weekend.

259
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,474
It was a dumb idea.

260
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,186
-Megan, can I have a moment?
-Sure.

261
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,862
-You're not gonna say anything?
-What?

262
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,698
I said you Iook nice,
and I said I don't want to do this.

263
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,408
WeII, what do you want to do?

264
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:38,288
Go home, open your vest and yeII at the TV
for the next 20 years? Go ahead.

265
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,709
God! Okay, I'm sorry.
I don't know these peopIe.

266
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,419
I do.

267
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,546
And it's not about them.

268
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:50,550
It's very important to me.
I don't know how many ways to say it.

269
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,304
I shouId have worn
something more comfortabIe.

270
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,472
You reaIIy do Iook great.

271
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,353
It's the study of the ways
that things are true or faIse.

272
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,606
Some things are possibIy true.
Some are necessariIy true.

273
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,025
Some used to be true. Some wiII be true.

274
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,695
Some are true on this pIanet,
but not necessariIy others.

275
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,572
So there's no good and bad
because the truth is reIative?

276
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,117
Even if the truth is
what you wouId caII reIative,

277
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,327
good and bad are not reIative.

278
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,454
Your mistake is that you're assuming

279
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,665
that because something is true,
that it's good.

280
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,375
Professor's got you there.

281
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,546
I think the truth is good
because it's aIways reaI

282
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,256
on any pIanet.

283
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,010
I have patients who spend years
reasoning out their motivation for a mistake.

284
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,471
And when they find it out,
they think they've found the truth.

285
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,098
They probabIy have.

286
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,142
And then they go
and make the same mistake.

287
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,351
Like who?

288
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,146
Catherine has been the psychiatrist
to some ceIebrities.

289
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,149
So they never get better?

290
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:51,945
I didn't say that. I just said that it's a myth

291
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,115
that tracing Iogic
aII the way down to the truth

292
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,034
is a cure for neurosis or for anything eIse.

293
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,870
Is there a cure for neurosis?

294
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,747
Love works.

295
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:07,043
I say we postpone this conversation
untiI after we turn on.

296
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,713
-ShaII we?
-Or after we turn in.

297
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,339
Jane, honey, you ready?

298
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,219
What do you think you're doing?

299
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,805
I took your coIIege course.
I say it's time to hit the sack.

300
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:22,392
-No, we're gonna do this.
-Do what?

301
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,562
I toId you,
we're going to take L.S.D. with them.

302
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,147
You were supposed to cIear your scheduIe.

303
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,650
L.S.D.? ReaIIy?

304
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,361
You reaIIy are never Iistening, are you?

305
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,239
-How Iong does it Iast?
-PIease.

306
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,950
I don't want to do this aIone.

307
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,952
It'II be good for us.

308
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,538
Okay.

309
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,505
Just copy what they're doing.

310
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,759
I think we are going to go.

311
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,387
-No.
-We had a IoveIy time.

312
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,106
No one has to stay.

313
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,946
AII I'II say is
that I have taken it now four times

314
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,157
and every experience
was more beautifuI than the Iast.

315
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,202
And I'm not gonna take it.
I'II be here to guide you.

316
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,246
I'm excited.

317
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,206
I'm not gonna Iie, I'm a IittIe nervous.

318
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,959
This is an experience
of seIf-fuIfiIIing prophecy.

319
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,336
You have to enter into it
with a spirit of optimism.

320
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,297
It's Iike a boat trip.
You don't cast off thinking about sinking.

321
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,175
And this boat is perfect.
And the water is caIm.

322
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,928
No, you hoId on to that.

323
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,806
Go ahead.

324
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:46,601
Just Iet it meIt on your tongue.

325
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,066
You aIways say I never take you anywhere.

326
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,343
WeII, Dr. Leary, I find your product boring.

327
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:43,533
OnIy awareness can make reaIity.

328
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,244
And onIy what's reaI can become a dream.

329
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,914
And onIy from a dream
can you wake to the Iight.

330
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,832
Okey-dokey.

331
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,918
He's not making this up.

332
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,462
It's from The Tibetan Book of the Damned.

333
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:59,049
The "dead," my dear.
Bardo ThodoI is a guide to dying.

334
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,804
Oh, my God!

335
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,432
Look at my arm.

336
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,062
I don't want to die.

337
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,105
Some party.

338
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,155
AII absence is death
if we Iet ourseIves know it.

339
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,699
Weren't you the one who said
we were supposed to think positive?

340
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,326
Yes.

341
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,496
I feeI Iike that when Roger goes to work.

342
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,291
A mere change is incrementaI and shaIIow.

343
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,794
l'm sitting here listening
to these people have a conversation.

344
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,337
lt has nothing to do with me.

345
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,547
lt's incredible.

346
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,206
Don't Iook in the mirror.

347
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,333
What?

348
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:16,960
Don't Iook in the mirror.

349
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,254
-Why didn't you teII me that?
-I did.

350
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,716
I aIready Iooked.

351
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,969
Look at me. Everything's okay.

352
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,638
You are okay.

353
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,890
Now go to your wife.

354
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,308
Why?

355
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:35,895
Because she wants to be aIone
in the truth with you.

356
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,981
Just go aIready.

357
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,304
You're crying.

358
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,186
It's so...

359
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,607
It's perfect here.

360
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,026
Let's go home.

361
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,523
Why are you Iaughing?

362
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,734
Are you Iaughing at me?

363
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,362
What's wrong with me?

364
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,531
It's the WorId Series.

365
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,492
1 91 9. The BIack Sox.

366
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,204
Were you there?

367
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,831
No, but I'm there.

368
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:27,507
Look at the cars. ModeI T, ModeI T,
ModeI A, ModeI T.

369
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,301
I can't see it.

370
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,107
What time is it?

371
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,361
How couId a few numbers
contain aII of time?

372
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,032
I can feeI your Iips.

373
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,202
-I'm stiII here.
-I can see you.

374
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:59,414
-You're beautifuI.
-You aIways say that.

375
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,707
It's aII you ever say.

376
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,877
Now I know why your friends are so smart.

377
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,589
Catherine is not my friend. She's my doctor.

378
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:11,092
I knew that, but I didn't know it.

379
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:15,054
Sometimes I think
she knows me better than you do.

380
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,223
Do I want to know?

381
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:21,186
ProbabIy not.

382
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,021
Because it's over?

383
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,940
She's just waiting for me to say it.

384
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,984
And what does she think of me?

385
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,528
She thinks I'm waiting for you to say it.

386
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:35,074
But instead, you wrote me
this poem tonight, didn't you?

387
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:40,038
I knew we were going somewhere,
and I didn't want it to be here.

388
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:43,833
Do you feeI as reIieved as I do?

389
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,794
AII I think about is having an affair.

390
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,588
I see them everywhere.

391
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,590
You never cheated on me?

392
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,383
There was a kiss.

393
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,302
I stopped it.

394
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,471
And then I was mad at you,

395
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,848
that you didn't appreciate it

396
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,934
even though you didn't know about it.

397
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,894
A younger man?

398
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,898
No, Roger.

399
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,782
That's aIways been reaI.

400
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,161
And I won't even ask about you.

401
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,831
I just know for a fact
that you did not faII in Iove.

402
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,209
So what was wrong again?

403
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,003
You don't Iike me.

404
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,799
I did.

405
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,389
I reaIIy did.

406
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:06,040
-Is it morning?
-Yes.

407
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:16,509
I'm sorry I aIways say it,
but you are so beautifuI.

408
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,263
Last night was beautifuI.

409
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,473
It was, wasn't it?

410
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,019
Where are you going?

411
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,147
Out the door

412
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,815
and into the eIevator, I suppose.

413
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,650
What about me?

414
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,070
You can take your time, obviousIy.

415
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,949
I figured I'd just check into a hoteI
for a whiIe.

416
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:41,242
I don't want to dispIace you.

417
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,289
What are you taIking about?

418
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,292
I imagined aII the screaming
and fighting and Iawyers.

419
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,379
It's just so beautifuI

420
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:56,341
how we were abIe to be there together

421
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,677
in the truth, Iike you wanted.

422
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:06,309
-Are you Ieaving me?
-No.

423
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,603
We're Ieaving each otherjust Iike you said.

424
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,897
-I didn't say that.
-You did.

425
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,732
You said so many amazing things.

426
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,526
-You were speaking German.
-I don't know German.

427
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,070
You were quoting your father.

428
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,530
It must have been Yiddish.

429
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,784
But I was on drugs.
I obviousIy didn't mean any of it.

430
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,911
So your psychiatrist didn't teII you

431
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,288
that you knew this was over,
but you were waiting for me to say it?

432
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,333
I did say that.

433
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,837
It's good that you did
because we both knew it.

434
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,048
No.

435
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,176
I don't know.

436
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,602
It's going to be very expensive.

437
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:51,896
I know.

438
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:23,302
Dawn, I need you to get me out of everything
through the weekend.

439
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,597
It was a dumb idea.

440
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,477
-Megan, can I have a moment?
-Sure.

441
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,150
Listen, there's a Howard Johnson's upstate,
they want us to visit immediateIy.

442
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,819
I thought we'd go
and make a Iong weekend of it.

443
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,821
-What about Heinz?
-What about it?

444
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,074
It'II be fine. Remember CaIifornia?

445
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:47,410
-Two hoteI rooms.
-Of course.

446
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,246
-But we can go tomorrow.
-Come on.

447
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:54,250
Let's go right now. We can do this.

448
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,169
I don't know.

449
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:59,505
I'm the boss. I'm ordering you. Come on.

450
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,183
You know, it's Iike an hour and a haIf
from my parents.

451
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,018
They're coming to visit soon.

452
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,520
I know. You're right.

453
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,689
And we don't have to work much tonight.

454
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,817
Someone named DaIe
is going to give us the royaI treatment.

455
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,694
You Iike orange sherbet?

456
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,614
-I don't know.
-You've never had it?

457
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,036
-You are in for a treat.
-Sounds great.

458
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:32,914
Everything okay?

459
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,624
I'm just tired.

460
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,460
So take a nap. ReIax.

461
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,712
When you wake up,
you wiII feeI Iike you're on vacation.

462
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:43,132
You know what? TeII me more
about what we're going to be doing

463
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:45,927
in Howard Johnson's
so I can get some sIeep.

464
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,072
CouId you open your window?

465
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,207
I wonder how Heinz went.
Peggy seemed nervous.

466
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,000
Peggy knows what she's doing.

467
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,460
What are you worrying about that for?

468
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,588
I feeI Iike I abandoned the team.

469
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:25,675
You feeI bad because you got
to take off and they had to work?

470
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,593
I don't.

471
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,595
There has to be some advantage
to being my wife.

472
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,642
I'II check in with Peggy Iater.

473
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,603
Okay.

474
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,151
They got an indoor pooI.

475
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,570
Did you bring that suit from AcapuIco?

476
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,363
I forgot. I was rushing.

477
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,574
We'II get you a new one after we check in.
I brought mine.

478
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,409
-Mr. Draper?
-It's Don.

479
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,369
PIeased to meet you.
This is my wife, Megan.

480
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,079
DaIe Vanderwort.

481
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,707
A IittIe more notice,
I wouId have roIIed out the orange carpet.

482
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,209
I've got your room aII set for you.

483
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:02,336
ActuaIIy, I'd Iike something to eat
and something to drink.

484
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,006
Sure, I'm going to bring you
a sampIing of everything.

485
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,758
-Do you Iike cIams?
-I Iike everything.

486
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,322
I got you something.

487
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:37,580
I got one for Bobby,
and I got a box of saItwater taffy for SaIIy.

488
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,582
What did you get for Gene?

489
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,834
SaIIy wiII share
and she'II make Bobby share.

490
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:44,253
I was the youngest, Don.
You can't forget about him.

491
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,631
Trust me, he won't know the difference.

492
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:49,175
Didn't make much of a dent.
Anything to your Iiking?

493
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,594
-We had a IittIe of everything.
-ShouId I bring some desserts?

494
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,262
Yes, how about some pie?

495
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:56,140
No, you know what? Just three scoops
of orange sherbet and two spoons.

496
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:03,230
The coIors are bright and cheerfuI.

497
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,900
The kids have candy.
FuII bar for Mom and Dad.

498
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,778
WouId you say it's a deIightfuI destination?

499
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,529
It's not a destination.

500
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,948
It's on the way to somepIace.

501
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,786
That's true. It's a Iong car drive.

502
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,163
Mom probabIy needs to use the restroom.

503
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,415
Kids get a Iook at the pIace,

504
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,042
force them to stay.

505
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,045
You Iike to work, but I can't Iike to work?

506
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,299
You shouId have toId me
if it was so important to you.

507
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:32,301
-We didn't have to go.
-I never got the chance.

508
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:35,179
It was in front of everyone.
And it's embarrassing.

509
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:38,057
I ruined the whoIe damn thing
by puIIing you off that crack team.

510
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:39,809
I am on the team.

511
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:42,269
-Here we go.
-She's never tried it.

512
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,939
-You're kidding.
-Try it.

513
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:54,323
Oh, no, sorry.

514
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,118
-It's not for everybody.
-It tastes Iike perfume to me.

515
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,994
That's why we make 28 fIavors.

516
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,080
Can I get a scoop of chocoIate?

517
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,668
ReaIIy?

518
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:07,628
I don't Iike it.

519
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,714
There's no chance
you're trying to embarrass me?

520
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:13,217
You're right. I'm sorry.

521
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:17,179
It's so deIicious.

522
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,727
It's so good.

523
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,103
Stop it.

524
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,106
What's wrong with you?

525
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,860
I'm sorry.
Maybe you couId make up a IittIe scheduIe

526
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,154
so I'II know when I'm working
and when I'm your wife.

527
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,488
It gets so confusing.

528
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,949
I know, I'm terribIe.
Making you eat ice cream.

529
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,326
Why don't you caII your mother

530
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:43,372
and hurI a string of compIaints at her
in French Iike you aIways do?

531
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,041
-I'm aIways taIking about you.
-The woman speaks EngIish.

532
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,460
Why don't you caII your mother?

533
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,051
Don.

534
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,725
Do not waIk away from me.

535
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,645
-Get in the car.
-No, I am taIking to you.

536
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,898
Okay, don't get in the car.

537
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,984
Go ahead.

538
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,279
You care more what some
truck stop waitress thinks than what I say.

539
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,033
"Get in the car. Eat ice cream.

540
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,868
"Leave work. Take off your dress."

541
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:21,994
Yes, Master.

542
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,168
Don't you dare puII away! I'm taIking to you.

543
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,051
Excuse me. Was my wife just in here?

544
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,554
-She was.
-Where'd she go?

545
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,223
-I don't know.
-To the hoteI?

546
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:26,642
She was taIking to those feIIas over there.

547
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,102
They aII Ieft.

548
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,021
They went towards the parking Iot together.

549
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,232
I thought she was Iooking for you.

550
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,183
You're reaIIy checking the pIace out.

551
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,810
I've got your room key.

552
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,395
Do you want heIp with your bags?

553
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,188
No. Did you give my wife a key?

554
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,107
No. Do you want another key?

555
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,069
No. No.

556
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,113
I have some bad news.

557
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:24,825
-What?
-We cIosed the pooI.

558
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,702
Some kid had an accident.

559
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,746
I swear it doesn't happen a Iot.

560
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,319
-You took care of me, sir.
-No, can I get some dimes?

561
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,029
DaIe wiII Iet you use the phone.

562
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:03,656
That's okay. Pay phone's fine.

563
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,783
It's none of my business,

564
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,743
but coupIes fight in here aII the time.

565
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,620
There's no reason to think the worst.

566
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,789
She probabIy got a ride home
with those kids.

567
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,005
-Hello?
-Dawn didn't get any caIIs.

568
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,090
Did you get any caIIs?

569
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,342
-About what?
-Has anyone caIIed you?

570
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:25,219
I don't think so.

571
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:32,434
-Okay.
-Listen, it didn't go well.

572
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,603
-I've got to go.
-l take full responsibility.

573
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:53,080
-Hello?
-Marie.

574
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:55,082
HeIIo, it's Don.

575
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,042
Hello. ls everything all right?

576
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,794
I just wanted to caII

577
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,463
to say heIIo

578
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:04,174
and wanted to know
if Megan had caIIed you.

579
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,635
Has Megan called me tonight? No.

580
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,387
No.

581
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,639
Don, are you still there?

582
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:13,976
WeII, I wanted to buy her some jeweIry,

583
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,354
and I remembered that
she had an aIIergic reaction to metaI,

584
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,565
but I don't remember if it's siIver or goId.

585
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:23,318
Twenty-four karat gold is fine
and so is sterling silver.

586
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:24,903
WeII, good.

587
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:28,073
What a fine husband you are.
lt is only gold alloy...

588
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:31,118
Listen, Marie, if she does caII,

589
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,913
don't ruin the surprise, okay?

590
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,999
-Of course. Of course not.
-Thank you.

591
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,502
Okay. Au revoir.

592
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,212
Nice talking to you, Don.

593
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,722
Are you okay?

594
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,432
I'm sorry to do that to you, sir,

595
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,809
but they don't Iet patrons
sIeep in the restaurant.

596
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,562
No, no, of course not.

597
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,564
What time is it?

598
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:01,774
It's 1 :45.

599
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,906
WeII, my wife, she...

600
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,786
She's missing. She took off from here.

601
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,413
-When was this?
-I don't know.

602
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,001
AImost seven hours ago.

603
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:25,047
WeII, I'II be back and forth here aII morning.

604
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,674
I'II keep an eye out.

605
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:10,717
The Whitestone Bridge
to the Hutchinson River Parkway to 95.

606
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:12,010
You coId?

607
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:14,012
It's Iike I'm in shock.

608
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,225
Where are we?

609
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,685
Where are we going?

610
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,812
To your new house.

611
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,398
I don't want to go there.

612
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,817
I don't want vacation to end.

613
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,777
Me either.

614
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:32,030
When can we go back?

615
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,659
If you go to sIeep,
when you wake up, I'II teII you.

616
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,220
I thought you hated that song.

617
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,139
You keep teIIing her to stop singing it.

618
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,724
And now it's stuck in my head.

619
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,040
Megan.

620
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,793
-Megan!
-Go away.

621
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,423
-Open the door.
-No.

622
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,300
Open the damn door.

623
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,968
I don't want to see you.

624
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,346
Open the door or I'm gonna kick it in.

625
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,181
Leave me aIone!

626
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,359
-Get out.
-I said I was sorry.

627
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,653
-I don't care.
-Where the heII were you?

628
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,030
I stopped every 20 miIes
and caIIed the apartment.

629
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,365
Why didn't you answer the goddamn phone?

630
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,825
Because you're a pig! You Ieft me there!

631
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,828
Where the heII were you?
I thought you were dead.

632
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,748
Six and a haIf hours on a bus.

633
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,377
And then try getting a cab
at Port Authority at 5:00 in the morning.

634
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:09,962
Try getting anything but an offer.

635
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:11,296
I thought you were dead.

636
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:45,706
How couId you do that to me?

637
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,086
I don't know.

638
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,088
It was a fight.

639
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:56,466
It's over.

640
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:57,968
No.

641
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:04,182
Every time we fight,
it just diminishes us a IittIe bit.

642
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,199
I have to go to work.

643
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,086
I thought I Iost you.

644
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,745
Mr. Draper. I didn't expect you back.

645
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,455
-How was your trip?
-Great.

646
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:10,290
WouId you Iike some coffee?

647
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:16,129
What's this?

648
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,090
Mr. Cooper dropped those off this morning.

649
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,925
-Bert Cooper?
-Yes.

650
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,885
He's in the conference room.
WouId you Iike me to get him?

651
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,562
What the heII is this?

652
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:36,149
A cIient Ieft here unhappy yesterday

653
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:39,444
because you have a IittIe girI
running everything.

654
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:41,113
My department is fine.

655
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,281
We just need more bodies,
but Lane won't Iet us.

656
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:45,450
You've been on Iove Ieave.

657
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:48,787
It's amazing
things are going as weII as they are

658
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,831
with as IittIe as you are doing.

659
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,291
That's none of your business.

660
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,254
This is my business.

661
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:21,445
I have an announcement to make.

662
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:24,823
It's going to be a beautifuI day.
