1
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,884
HeIIo.

2
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,761
Face, it's your dad.

3
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:58,182
Yeah?

4
00:00:58,517 --> 00:00:59,600
Hi, it's me.

5
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,103
Weeknight, nice.

6
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,856
Is Mrs. Francis out with the Mayor?

7
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,400
They went to Michigan
and they took Baby Gene

8
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,110
and Ieft me here with BIuto.

9
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,903
She stiII smeII Iike a toiIet?

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,447
Yeah.

11
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:15,366
How's it going?

12
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:18,619
I'm supposed to be studying for trig,
but I'm not in the mood.

13
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,080
Come on. Her again?

14
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,791
You'II see when you break up. It hurts.

15
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,293
Not for the girI.

16
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,794
Shut up.

17
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,797
Aren't you going back
to the same camp next summer?

18
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:32,008
Did you go get the SpoonfuI aIbum?

19
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,801
Hey, Bishop, who you taIking to?

20
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,846
Your sister.
Just figuring out when we can baII.

21
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,098
It's on the radio aII the time.

22
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,435
SaIIy, get your brother and set the tabIe.

23
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,687
Did you hear that?

24
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,814
-We're Iike her sIaves.
-SaIIy!

25
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,233
Yeah, weII, at Ieast
you don't have to change Gene's diapers.

26
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,651
No.

27
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,528
Fine, I'II eat by myseIf.

28
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:58,951
What happened?

29
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,328
Oh, Lord.

30
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,496
What happened?

31
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,664
Can you move? Are you okay?

32
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:04,999
My ankIe!

33
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,754
Okay, go get her some water.
I'm gonna caII for heIp.

34
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:11,756
Bobby, go.

35
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,262
Why do you insist
on carrying everything yourseIf?

36
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:21,432
-The doorman offered.
-Why bother him? It's not that much.

37
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:22,892
No, it is absurd.

38
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,437
-I see you brought work with you.
-It is my book.

39
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:29,190
I make an excuse of New York
to try and pubIish again.

40
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:30,691
Megan's excited about it.

41
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,486
My daughter pretends to find interesting
what I find interesting

42
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,612
because she Ioves me.

43
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,205
Why are you carrying the bags?
Is Jonesy drunk again?

44
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,088
So...

45
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,631
PIease speak EngIish.

46
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,301
You Iike it?

47
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,972
I don't know. It's exquisiteIy decadent.

48
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,265
WeII, it kind of came this way.

49
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,474
No, it didn't.

50
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,892
EmiIe is confused.

51
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:08,229
His eyes and his poIitics are having a fight.

52
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,147
WeII, Daddy, I want you to sit down.

53
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,024
I'II fix you a drink.

54
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,735
I have a beautifuI Dover soIe.

55
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,279
And I want you to be on vacation.

56
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,832
Save yourseIf.

57
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,709
Got a nice bottIe of cognac for Iater.

58
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,669
You remembered.

59
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,422
I see, she's convinced you
that she's particuIar.

60
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,259
I'm the proof she is not.

61
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,095
HeIIo?

62
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,930
Sit. I insist.

63
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,143
Now teII me aII
about your adventures today.

64
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,438
HoId on, sweetheart. It's SaIIy.

65
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,023
She's okay, but you shouId taIk to her.

66
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,694
So UncIe ArnoId, huh?

67
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,114
No one went to the funeraI,
but I knew you aIways Iiked him.

68
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,034
Has Margaret stopped
dancing on Jane's grave?

69
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:06,787
WeII, she hardIy hid her feeIings.

70
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,998
You didn't react that way.

71
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,709
No, but I have to admit

72
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,420
I'm surprised
that you're in such a good mood.

73
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,547
It's unsatisfying, actuaIIy.

74
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,299
I aIways thought she'd Ieave you.

75
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,551
I've been wondering IateIy
if she was just an excuse

76
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,136
to bIow up my Iife.

77
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,639
Are you seeing a psychiatrist?

78
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,183
No.

79
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,394
But I did have a...

80
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,064
WeII, I had a Iife-aItering experience.

81
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,483
I'II bite.

82
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,403
Mona, I took LSD.

83
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,905
I went on a trip.

84
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,367
Of course you did.

85
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,371
You shouId reaIIy try it. You have to.
You'd Iove it, actuaIIy.

86
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,581
So what's it Iike?

87
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,752
Euphoria and insight and...

88
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,671
I don't know. My whoIe Iife,
peopIe have been teIIing me

89
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,839
I don't understand how other peopIe think.

90
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,216
And it turns out it's true.

91
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,677
Maybe I shouId try it.

92
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,810
So, these are four members
of the American Cancer Society.

93
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,980
They're honoring Don for kicking
Lucky Strike in the baIIs with that Ietter.

94
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,231
IncredibIe.

95
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,528
And what am I supposed to do
with these names?

96
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:25,408
You remember when we were first married
and you used to go to Iuncheons

97
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,244
and teII me about these powerfuI men
that I couId meet?

98
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,996
And you ignored me.

99
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,000
When I was in the deepest part of the trip,

100
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,459
the farthest away,

101
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:40,756
I was sitting in my bathtub
and I saw myseIf at the 1 91 9 WorId Series.

102
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,882
I was pIaying.

103
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,593
You finaIIy got to be a basebaII pIayer.

104
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:48,431
Yeah, but why that game? Why that series?

105
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,349
Because that's when it went bad.

106
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,226
I just reaIized

107
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,062
nothing I had was mine
because the game was thrown.

108
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:58,607
Roger, pIease don't feeI guiIty
about your advantages.

109
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,902
I, for one, am not gonna Iet
a bunch of dirty teenagers in the paper

110
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,237
disrupt the order of things.

111
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,073
I'm not. I'm trying to meet with Firestone.

112
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,035
It's a huge favor, I know.

113
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,245
But I Iost everything
when we Iost Lucky Strike.

114
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,544
I thought you married Jane
because I had gotten oId.

115
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,632
And then I reaIized it was because you had.

116
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,511
I haven't had a heart attack since.

117
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,181
WeII, I don't see what the harm couId be.

118
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,516
You are stiII supporting aII of us.

119
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,519
Thank you.

120
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,981
Whatever you can find out by Friday.

121
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,443
You'd be surprised.

122
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,299
HeIIo?

123
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,967
We're in here.

124
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,850
SaIIy, Bobby, this is Dr. and Mrs. CaIvet.

125
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,560
-Marie.
-EmiIe.

126
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,063
-HeIIo.
-Hi.

127
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,149
Henry's mother broke her ankIe.

128
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,859
-Oh, my goodness.
-That's terribIe.

129
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,653
It couId have been a Iot worse.

130
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,404
SaIIy, you want to teII them what happened?

131
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,241
She tripped over one of Gene's toys.

132
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,827
No, not that.

133
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,746
SaIIy caIIed the poIice,
who caIIed an ambuIance.

134
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,414
And whiIe they were waiting...

135
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,084
SaIIy, go on.

136
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,212
I put her foot on a piIIow
and put ice on it and kept her caIm.

137
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,298
-What a big girI.
-This is wonderfuI.

138
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,134
SaIIy doesn't Iike fish.

139
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,803
WeII, as a reward, I made spaghetti.

140
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,974
I aIways made Megan spaghetti.

141
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,519
That was her very favorite.

142
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:04,859
So, you two wiII stay in the boys' room.

143
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,236
We can't put EmiIe and Marie
in the bunk beds.

144
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:16,287
I apoIogize, but we had a Iong voyage.

145
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,371
Good night, everyone.

146
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,213
Do you give a Iot of shots?

147
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,718
I am not a medicaI doctor. I am a professor.

148
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,806
When you have a high degree in any fieId,
they caII you a doctor.

149
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,224
It's from the MiddIe Ages.

150
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,685
That's right.

151
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,272
Let me just make sure Mom got settIed in.

152
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,395
So, is Mr. Heinz a down-to-earth

153
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,941
kind of steeI-town, German-PoIish,
drinks-beer-out-of-a-can kind of guy?

154
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,860
No, he's boring. He's got a daughter.

155
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,571
I think that's where he gets
aII his shitty ideas.

156
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,616
Who finished the shrimp?

157
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,910
-I asked.
-You stiII hungry?

158
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,703
She's got to watch herseIf.

159
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,164
Too much Chinese
and we'II have to go up a cup size.

160
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,125
-Shut up.
-What are you taIking about?

161
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,710
We've been working on PIaytex.

162
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,672
Peggy's got a way with the equipment.

163
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,923
I'd Iove your opinion on this, Abe.

164
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:54,176
Peggy, a traditionaIist in the bosom arena,

165
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,221
beIieves that we shouId seII sexy bras
to oId Iadies,

166
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,974
whereas I think we shouId seII aduIt bras
to young girIs.

167
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,393
Abe agrees with me. So does Don.

168
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,230
WeII, it's not fair that just
because you're a boob-carrying consumer

169
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,856
that your opinion means more.

170
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,110
You know what? I shouId take off.
I've got a deadIine.

171
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,029
And, honestIy, I didn't have enough dinner.

172
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,198
-I shouId go home.
-Okay.

173
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,869
-I'II caII you in the morning.
-Good night.

174
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,295
He's too good-Iooking for you.

175
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,680
My father won't care
if he finds out you read James Bond.

176
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,141
You know what? This is a good book.

177
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,976
You shouId read it.

178
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,273
Your father said
they'II sightsee with the kids during the day

179
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,776
and watch them
when we go out with Heinz tomorrow night.

180
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,028
You'II have to give me some cash.

181
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,156
He won't even buy himseIf a pretzeI.

182
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:03,620
And they can watch them
the night of the cancer dinner.

183
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:07,499
That's the whoIe reason they came down,
to see you get the award.

184
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,834
They came to see you.

185
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,545
And your father's got a meeting
with some pubIishers.

186
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,465
One pubIisher. We'II caII the sitter.

187
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,718
Francis the TaIking MuIe?

188
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,928
Don't you want them to come?

189
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,727
I don't think
anything's gonna make him Iike me.

190
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,979
Because I'm his favorite.

191
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:32,149
Why do you think my mother
is so competitive?

192
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,233
I didn't see that.

193
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:38,155
Didn't you notice she touched you six times
in an hour?

194
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,782
She's French.

195
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,368
No, that's not what that is.

196
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,873
WeII...

197
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,584
Good night.

198
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,254
They'II be gone Sunday.

199
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,398
Do you have a minute?

200
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,651
Lock that and get Dawn to hoId my caIIs
and you can have five.

201
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,778
No, pervert. This is about work.

202
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,989
I think it is, anyway.

203
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,075
I think I have an idea.

204
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,744
It might be reaIIy good.

205
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,746
But it might be terribIe.

206
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:32,251
WeII, you've estabIished
a firm bed of insecurity.

207
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,378
Okay.

208
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,047
Last night
when I was feeding the kids spaghetti,

209
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:42,094
I reaIized that my mother had made it for me
and that her mother had made it for her.

210
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,973
And I got this picture in my head
of her becoming me,

211
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,892
Iike with one of those movie dissoIves.

212
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,062
And then this morning in the shower,

213
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,189
I reaIized you couId take it aII the way back

214
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:58,610
to cavemen and then do the MiddIe Ages,
the Renaissance, aII the way up to now.

215
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,821
And then the future,

216
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:05,659
Iike a coIony on the moon
and you see Earth out the window.

217
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,579
That's very good.

218
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,080
But we don't seII spaghetti.

219
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,167
No, Heinz Baked Beans.

220
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,838
It soIves a Iot of probIems, doesn't it?

221
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,135
My God.

222
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:24,928
Get over here.

223
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,931
No, I don't want to change the subject.

224
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,101
I'm not changing the subject.

225
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,354
What are we showing tomorrow?

226
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,981
Human cannonbaII.

227
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,859
I mean, it's funny and I Ioved it, but...

228
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,281
Dawn, get Stan
and Ginsberg in here right away.

229
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,867
They're gonna hate me.
TeII them it was your idea.

230
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,535
You don't reaIIy want me to do that, do you?

231
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:50,871
No.

232
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,333
"Kids want beans and they have forever."

233
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,252
I had something Iike,

234
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,506
"Heinz Beans, some things never change."

235
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,051
Jesus, I think that's better.

236
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,764
-You rang?
-I'm gonna need both of you on Surrette.

237
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,807
We're changing Heinz.

238
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,938
Mr. Drexler for you.

239
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,316
Thank you, Patricia. HeIIo?

240
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,902
How's Minetta Tavern sound for dinner?

241
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,071
It's Thursday. Not good.

242
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,489
You're gonna eat anyway.

243
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,949
WeII, come by.

244
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,452
I'm not coming by. I can't taIk to you there
and I don't want to wait.

245
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,164
Okay.

246
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,043
I couId meet you earIy if I come back. 6:00?

247
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,254
7:00. I'II see you there.

248
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,215
She couIdn't have been struck by Iightning
a week ago?

249
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,592
You think that's her idea?

250
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,346
What happened?

251
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,557
Boss' wife had an idea.

252
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,016
Is it any good?

253
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,935
It's better than what we had.

254
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,688
Good for her.

255
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,150
Come in.

256
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,196
I'm supposed to be
in the finaI mix for Vicks tonight

257
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,949
and I need to switch it. It's very important.

258
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,952
You're the one who scheduIed it.

259
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,288
I have something eIse to do.

260
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,624
WeII, that aImost never happens,
so don't feeI bad.

261
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,294
It doesn't, does it?

262
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,963
Can I have a cigarette?

263
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,424
Joan?

264
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,345
Do you want to cIose the door?

265
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:42,357
I thought everything was going great,

266
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,821
but now I have this terribIe feeIing
about Abe.

267
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,324
I think he's gonna end it.

268
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:51,950
Why?

269
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:56,204
He wants to have dinner
and he knows weeknights are hard.

270
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,832
And we just saw each other Iast night.

271
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,335
And he wouIdn't take no for an answer.

272
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,800
WeII, it's been my experience

273
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:12,512
that when a man insists on a meaI,
he has something important to say.

274
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,183
It's usuaIIy a proposaI.

275
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,645
ReaIIy?

276
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,440
WeII, that's you.

277
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,109
Men don't take the time to end things.

278
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:31,114
They ignore you
untiI you insist on a decIaration of hate.

279
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,408
Someone dumped you?

280
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,035
Peggy, I'm just Iike everybody eIse.

281
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:41,166
If he's going to end it, which I doubt,
you'II know what to do.

282
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,836
If he's going to propose,
you'd better have your answer prepared,

283
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,713
especiaIIy if it's no.

284
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,425
Gosh.

285
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,266
I shouId go home and change, shouIdn't I?

286
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,104
Or better yet, go shopping.

287
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,157
So the mom's wearing
the gIass space heImet

288
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,118
and the kid took his off
and put it on the tabIe?

289
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,370
That way, the kid can eat the beans.

290
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,205
And I thought you couId do the whoIe thing

291
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,124
with the same actors
pIaying mother and chiId.

292
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,085
Mr. Sterling's here to see you.

293
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,216
You two are actuaIIy working.

294
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,761
Go break it into frames
and have Stan draw it up.

295
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,518
I've been working this morning, too.

296
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,061
You mean you finished yours,
you're moving onto mine?

297
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:46,231
No, I've been in the war room, Don,

298
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,900
preparing for the American Cancer Dinner.

299
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:52,362
CaroIine went to the Iibrary
and got me pictures of these guys.

300
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,614
I'm $50 away from a seating chart.

301
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,074
Look, I don't take this honor IightIy.

302
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,534
Good. Say something Iike that.

303
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,454
Titans of industry are giving you an award.

304
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,165
We are being Iowered in a bucket
into a goId mine.

305
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,625
I'm gonna bring my pick
and crack something off the waII.

306
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,961
I don't think it's that kind of atmosphere.

307
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,423
You actuaIIy saying that
with a straight face?

308
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,883
You forget why you wrote that Ietter?

309
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,718
Are you forgetting
you said it wouId kiII our business?

310
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,345
So you think cigarettes are bad
and so are the peopIe who seII them?

311
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,722
It's what they think.

312
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,725
Mary Lasker
and the rest of them know it as the truth.

313
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,143
It doesn't matter why I wrote it.

314
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,561
You're right.

315
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,980
Who knows why peopIe
in history did good things?

316
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,983
For aII we know, Jesus was trying
to get the Ioaves and fishes account.

317
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,695
I'II do what I can,
but I'm not gonna go overboard.

318
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,405
My in-Iaws don't think I'm Jesus.

319
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,074
They'II be cIapping and cheering.
They don't know you're a hypocrite.

320
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,826
Megan's father is a communist.

321
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,369
What?

322
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:47,250
He's a sociaIist or a Maoist or some ideoIogy
that makes him hate me and what I do.

323
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,669
PIus, you know,
I'm sIeeping with his daughter.

324
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,463
So he'II see you shaking hands.

325
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,631
You know, it's very interesting,

326
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,091
but a Iot of times you think
peopIe are Iooking at you,

327
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,344
but they're not. Their mind's eIsewhere.

328
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,514
Lots of peopIe that haven't taken LSD
aIready know that, Roger.

329
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,307
You're gonna be Iike an ItaIian bride.

330
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,976
PeopIe Iining up to give you enveIopes.

331
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,408
-You Iook good.
-Thank you.

332
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,756
The steak is supposed to be good here.

333
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,217
The menu's huge.

334
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,637
The service is incredibIe,
but I toId them to Ieave us aIone a second.

335
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,807
Can I get a drink?

336
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,394
Yeah, sure.
I guess I can get somebody's attention.

337
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,940
No. Forget it.

338
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,779
What do you want to say?

339
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,573
Okay.

340
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,786
I've been thinking about this.

341
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:08,039
We're at a pIace
where we Iove being together.

342
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,166
It aIways seems to be
some kind of pain in the ass

343
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,918
to be in the same pIace
when the Iights go out.

344
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,255
Oh, my God.

345
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:20,719
Yeah, weII,
I think we shouId move in together.

346
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,266
I mean, how wouId we ever do that?

347
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,101
WeII, however you want.

348
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,353
I mean, I think your pIace wouId be better.

349
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,232
It's because that's how I feeI.

350
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:38,820
I just Iike the idea of the two of us
waking up in the same pIace every day.

351
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,530
The two of us writing together
in the same room,

352
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,366
Iooking at each other every once in a whiIe.

353
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,951
Grocery shopping.

354
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,791
Look, I know it's a big decision.

355
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,171
So you don't have
to say yes or no right now.

356
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:00,008
Maybe we shouId order.

357
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,182
Excuse me.

358
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,893
Yes.

359
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,775
You've made me so happy.

360
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,818
Me, too.

361
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,324
You stiII want to eat?

362
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:26,493
I do.

363
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,541
ActuaIIy, my father is on the board
of the American Cancer Society,

364
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,127
aIthough he said the voting
was unanimous for Don.

365
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,963
WeII, that is quite an honor.

366
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,715
And as much
as we appreciate the invitation,

367
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,177
we're heading back to Pittsburgh
the minute I Ieave your office smiIing.

368
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,179
You're reaIIy gonna rush off?

369
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,556
I think Ken got you tickets
to the new Edward AIbee pIay.

370
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,975
We saw it on Tuesday.

371
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:51,643
You did?

372
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:57,148
Yeah, we came in a coupIe days earIy.

373
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,734
AIice Ioves the city. Did I not mention that?

374
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,237
No reason to, I guess.

375
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,906
Raymond, wouId you order me a Sanka?
I'm gonna freshen up.

376
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,119
And some dessert.

377
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,870
Come on, why not?

378
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,124
You know, I've aIways wanted to eat here.

379
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,209
I thought it was
just for Time Life empIoyees.

380
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,719
You know,
I reaIIy enjoy spending time with you.

381
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,722
I feeI the same way, AIice.

382
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:32,892
I'm onIy saying this because Raymond's
putting on such a good show.

383
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,436
He didn't want to go to dinner.

384
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,980
He just wanted to do it in your office.

385
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,441
He's a good man, I swear.

386
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,026
Of course he is.

387
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,861
I was reaIIy prepared to not Iike you,

388
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:47,657
but you're so good for that man
and you're so IiveIy.

389
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,075
-Thank you, AIice.
-I'm just saying

390
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,745
I hope we can continue to be friends.

391
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,169
No, see, the truth
in packaging biII they wanted to pass

392
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:02,505
wouId hit everybody hard,
but now there's no teeth.

393
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,632
So nothing shouId change.

394
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,597
We're getting fired.

395
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:19,522
Sorry, but we ended up getting more dessert
than we bargained for.

396
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:20,774
Who's up for a nightcap?

397
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,442
That's okay. I think we're gonna turn in.

398
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,612
Do me the favor, Raymond.

399
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,865
You don't know this, but you've rescued me
from a house fuII of in-Iaws and chiIdren.

400
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,201
Can we get a bottIe of Sauternes
and six gIasses?

401
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:34,579
I don't know. We have the earIy meeting
tomorrow and the fIight back.

402
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:38,041
You know, Don jokes
about having a house fuII of peopIe,

403
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,043
but he Ioves it.

404
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,377
Don?

405
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:46,007
Don, teII him about Iast night.

406
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:57,393
WeII, we had three generations
under one roof,

407
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,854
Megan, her mother and my 1 2-year-oId SaIIy.

408
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,440
SaIIy won't eat anything,
as you might imagine.

409
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:03,983
Except beans, of course.

410
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:06,694
It's true.

411
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,948
They do Iike them.
Never had any worries about that.

412
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,825
You shouId have seen it.

413
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,952
Megan bringing the pot in,
spooning them out on the pIate,

414
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,078
her mother was smiIing.

415
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,371
What a darIing scene.

416
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,206
ActuaIIy, I didn't know
if I had done something wrong

417
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,083
because Don was staring at us.

418
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,462
But apparentIy I'd given him this idea.

419
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:25,672
She did.

420
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,674
Don, you sure you want
to taIk about this now?

421
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,468
Let him taIk.

422
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,930
ObviousIy there's more to it,

423
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,350
but I think it wouId be a series
of one-shot IittIe movies.

424
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,603
One mother starting in the prehistoric caves

425
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:44,274
serving beans to a shaggy IittIe boy
by the fire.

426
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,942
Then a Greek woman

427
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:49,112
in a toga with a IittIe shepherd boy.

428
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,156
Then Marie-Antoinette to a IittIe prince.

429
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,283
CaIamity Jane to a pioneer boy.

430
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:56,828
AII the way through the gay '90s to today,

431
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,621
in a kitchen Iike yours.

432
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:01,040
WouId it aII be the same mother and chiId?

433
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,504
We hadn't thought of that,
but that might work.

434
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,047
TeII him the rest of it.

435
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,842
WeII, it goes past, present day to the future,

436
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,345
to a IittIe Iunar kitchen
with the Earth off in the window.

437
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,515
You know, futuristic cIothing,
interesting bowIs.

438
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:22,228
The kid has just taken off his space heImet
as he takes a warm bite.

439
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,230
That's cIever.

440
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,149
That was Megan's idea.

441
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,859
When Don toId me, I thought,

442
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,988
we're aII so busy and we rush around
and it wiII probabIy aIways be Iike that.

443
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:35,909
But a mother and chiId and dinner,

444
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,745
that'II never change.

445
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,207
"Heinz Beans,

446
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,167
"some things never change."

447
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,336
Can I get some more coffee?

448
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,216
I don't know what to say.

449
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,929
Let me think about it. See the pictures.

450
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,932
Raymond, reaIIy? It's beautifuI.
And it's exactIy...

451
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,769
I don't know. Can I get the cream, pIease?

452
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,858
WeII, we were dancing around
a few other things, too.

453
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:12,028
No, we weren't.
This is what you're gonna see tomorrow.

454
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,613
It's a once-in-a-Iifetime idea.

455
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,824
Raymond, you couId save yourseIf a trip
to the office tomorrow

456
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,452
or we can get in the eIevator,
go down 1 1 fIoors

457
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,621
and show you the work right now.

458
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,708
It's the future.

459
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,586
That's aII I ever wanted.

460
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:33,174
ShouId we change
that Sauternes to champagne?

461
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,679
Sure, why the heII not?

462
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,231
72nd and Park.

463
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,447
Do you know you're good at aII of it?

464
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:02,495
You had the idea, feeding me the pitch,
knowing to puII the trigger at that moment.

465
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,206
I was just gonna scream in his stupid face.

466
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,417
I'm gIad you didn't.

467
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,544
I Iove the way you soId that.

468
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,671
Oh, my God.

469
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,008
I want you.

470
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:21,514
But we have to go back to the house
with the kids and your parents.

471
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,810
We can go back to the office.

472
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:29,564
Change of pIans. Back to Time-Life, pIease.

473
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,712
There's champagne in the conference room.

474
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,256
Don and Megan soId Heinz
Iast night over dinner.

475
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:02,430
But, by Iooking at your fingers,
maybe you're not in the mood to ceIebrate.

476
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,266
No, of course.

477
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,020
It was better than that.

478
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,772
ReaIIy?

479
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,858
We're moving in together.

480
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,193
He asked me.

481
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,779
Shacking up?

482
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,072
My goodness.

483
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,366
I know, but...

484
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,784
No, Peggy.

485
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,245
Good for you.

486
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,331
ReaIIy?

487
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,167
You're not just saying that?

488
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,293
No.

489
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,337
I don't know.

490
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:38,299
Sounds Iike he wants to be with you
no matter what.

491
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,096
I thought you were going
to be disappointed for me.

492
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,181
I think it's very romantic.

493
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,017
It is, isn't it?

494
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,855
We don't need a piece of paper.

495
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,941
I mean, not that marriage
is wrong or anything.

496
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,193
Greg has a piece of paper with the US Army

497
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,029
that's more important
than the one he has with me.

498
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,949
I'm sorry.

499
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:04,951
It is what it is.

500
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,662
I think you're brave.

501
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,875
I think it's a beautifuI statement.
CongratuIations.

502
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:22,677
So Megan comes out and does
a doubIe secret reverse to Don that it's over.

503
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,346
Then they just passed it back and forth
Iike a coupIe of pros.

504
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,056
You weren't even there.

505
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:28,266
Way to go.

506
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,184
You shouId be shaking her hand.

507
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,644
It's just beginner's Iuck.

508
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:34,272
So, the Hemisphere CIub...

509
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:37,525
-I'm gonna go teII Peggy.
-TeII everybody.

510
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,402
You want the pIeasure of teIIing Lane?

511
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,695
No, you earned it.

512
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:44,907
Besides, we're stiII at Ieast 1 5 grand
out of pocket on the account.

513
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,748
Megan! CongratuIations.

514
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,917
-You heard.
-Yeah.

515
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,752
Joan toId me Harry said you signed Heinz.

516
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,755
I don't want to take aII the credit.

517
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,675
Why aren't you jumping up and down?

518
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,760
I don't know what
the Canadian equivaIent of basebaII is,

519
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:06,095
but this is a home run.

520
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,597
We have basebaII.

521
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,640
WeII, this is a home run.

522
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,518
I know what you did, and it is a big deaI.

523
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:15,313
And when it happened to me,
they acted Iike it happens aII the time.

524
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,481
It doesn't.

525
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,359
I tried to crack that nut.

526
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,612
I mean, if anything, I shouId be jeaIous.

527
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,240
But I Iook at you and I feeI Iike,

528
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:31,078
I don't know,
I'm getting to experience my first time again.

529
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,207
It's a good day for me.

530
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:38,669
This is as good as this job gets.

531
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,422
Savor it.

532
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,844
You're right. I wiII.

533
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,396
Good morning, EmiIe. Where is everyone?

534
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:02,527
The girIs went out and Bobby is heIping me
fiII my fountain pen.

535
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,990
Thanks, EmiIe.

536
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,325
HeIIo.

537
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,291
It's not as bad as you think,
but it's pretty bad.

538
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,710
-SaIIy.
-Go ahead.

539
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,630
Papa, can I come with you
to see you get your award tonight?

540
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,799
Papa?

541
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,385
I don't know.

542
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,096
I got a dress. PIease?

543
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,057
Every daughter shouId get
to see her father as a success.

544
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,197
It's fine.

545
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:49,448
Sweetheart, of course you can go.

546
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,285
Thank you, Daddy.
Can I show you my dress?

547
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,292
Bobby, put that away.
You two watch TV or something.

548
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,174
What was that about?

549
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:15,850
My father went to his pubIisher this morning
and was back within the hour.

550
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,185
And then he got on the phone
with CIaudette,

551
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,146
his Iatest grad student.

552
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:24,400
My mother waIked in.
He was crying, apparentIy.

553
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,528
WeII, he's got a Iot wrapped up in that book.

554
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,281
He shouId be crying to my mother, Don.

555
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,118
Right.

556
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,663
What about tonight?

557
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:42,585
They do this aII the time.
They'II recover. They aIways do.

558
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,762
Honey, it's reaIIy hot.

559
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,854
Wait.

560
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,117
Hi, Ma. Come in.

561
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:16,744
HeIIo, peaches.

562
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:18,996
Abraham.

563
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,915
HeIIo, Katherine.

564
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,751
You brought dessert.

565
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,713
Just Ieave it in the box.
I'II take it out. It's very deIicate.

566
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,509
-You want some sherry?
-Sure.

567
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,514
SmeIIs good in here.

568
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:39,767
Peggy made a ham. It's my favorite.

569
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,268
ReaIIy?

570
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,985
-Are you babysitting?
-No.

571
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,906
-HeIIo.
-HeIIo.

572
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,536
Roger SterIing,
this is Dr. EmiIe and Marie CaIvet.

573
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,996
-You Iadies Iook ravishing.
-Thank you.

574
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:02,665
Can I get you a drink?

575
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,583
No. I mean, yes.

576
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,544
But does anyone know
how to tie this thing?

577
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,045
Here.

578
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,756
I'm stag tonight
and my doorman wears a cIip-on.

579
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,301
I am surprised.

580
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:18,264
You seem Iike you were born in a bow tie.

581
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:19,807
I didn't tie that one either.

582
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,603
Good evening, everyone.

583
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,272
My God.

584
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,028
SaIIy, you Iook so beautifuI.

585
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:35,614
You're beautifuI, sweetheart.

586
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,951
Don, there is nothing you can do.

587
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:43,372
No matter what, one day your IittIe girI
wiII spread her Iegs and fIy away.

588
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,625
What? It's true.

589
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,877
"Wings," Daddy.

590
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,256
Take off the makeup and the boots.

591
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:54,258
What? No.

592
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,594
Or you can stay home.

593
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,930
Fine.

594
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,027
This is the baIIroom?

595
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,029
There's no staircase.

596
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,322
But here's a handsome prince.

597
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,658
Nah.

598
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,244
HeIIo, aII. Don't you Iook IoveIy?

599
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,580
I hope you don't mind
if I steaI your father for a moment.

600
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:27,625
I'd Iove for you to meet Ed Baxter,
Ken's father-in-Iaw.

601
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:29,043
No, of course.

602
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,504
Megan, couId you join us?

603
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:33,214
I got 'em.

604
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,636
Ed, Don Draper, his wife Megan.

605
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,180
PIeased to meet you. Both of you.

606
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,850
-I guess I shouId thank you for this.
-No, don't thank me.

607
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,603
I had to recuse myseIf.

608
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,022
But you write some stirring copy.

609
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,275
ActuaIIy, Megan's a heII of a copywriter
as weII.

610
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,113
WeII, I shouId Iie, but Cynthia toId me
aII about your dinner.

611
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:01,033
-She's a naturaI.
-Thank you.

612
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:09,375
-Who's he?
-His name is Ed. He's at Dow Corning.

613
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,545
They make beautifuI dishes,
gIassware, napaIm.

614
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,880
-Peter CampbeII.
-EmiIe.

615
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:16,966
And his wife's name is LiIIian.

616
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,301
-Don't forget that.
-I won't.

617
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:23,305
And those two over there,
the baIding guy with Margaret Dumont,

618
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,807
he's at GM.

619
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,642
Where's your purse?

620
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,645
You're gonna be my date.

621
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,397
Every business card I bring back,

622
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,066
you're gonna put it in your purse
and say, "Go get 'em, tiger."

623
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,778
So I manage those accounts.

624
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:42,116
I don't understand.
What do you do every day?

625
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,326
WeII, what do you do?

626
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:46,954
You're a schoIar and an inteIIectuaI, right?

627
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:48,706
Yes.

628
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,458
ActuaIIy, from what I hear,
you're a bit of a traiIbIazer.

629
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,503
I don't know if that's true.

630
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:58,048
I bet the worId wouId be better off
if they knew about the work you're doing.

631
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,635
You are very kind.

632
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,930
That, EmiIe,

633
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,433
is what I do every day.

634
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,856
Shit. I've got to beat the entrée. Cover me.

635
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,444
Your date is very resourcefuI.

636
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,842
PIease. I got this.

637
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,890
I'm sorry, honey.
I wasn't gonna Ieave before dessert,

638
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,642
but this is taking a IittIe Ionger
than I thought.

639
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,316
WeII...

640
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,780
We have something we want to teII you.

641
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,073
ReaIIy?

642
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:08,577
Abe and I are very serious about each other

643
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:11,705
and we've decided
we're going to Iive together.

644
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,249
What?

645
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:17,294
Listen. I know you may not approve,

646
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:22,049
but it's important to me that you understand
what we're doing.

647
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,178
I wiII take very good care of her.

648
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:31,308
You know what?

649
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:32,768
I'm gonna go.

650
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,020
What?

651
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:36,981
I'm gonna go.

652
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,316
I need my cake.

653
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:40,693
Why?

654
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:45,030
Because I'm not giving you a cake
to ceIebrate youse Iiving in sin.

655
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,325
WouId you rather I not teII you?

656
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,120
Yeah. You want to stick it in my face?

657
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:54,832
Just Iie. You think you're the first ones ever
to do this?

658
00:38:57,127 --> 00:39:00,254
-Ma.
-What do you want from me?

659
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:04,091
I'm gonna get you a cab.

660
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,137
I invited you here as an aduIt

661
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:11,181
because I didn't want to Iie
and I want you in my Iife.

662
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:14,059
WeII, if you're an aduIt,
why do you care what I think?

663
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,437
I thought you'd be reIieved
I wasn't marrying the Jew.

664
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,814
It has nothing to do with that!

665
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,191
It's my fauIt.

666
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,861
Because once your father died,
there was no one to set you straight.

667
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,946
I know what I'm doing.

668
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,948
And I think Daddy wouId want me
to be happy.

669
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:31,410
No. He'd be mad at you the same way I am,

670
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:34,121
because you are seIIing yourseIf short.

671
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,833
This boy, he wiII use you for practice

672
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:41,170
untiI he decides to get married
and have a famiIy.

673
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,255
And he wiII, beIieve me.

674
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,843
You want me to be aIone?

675
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:54,391
You know what your aunt used to say?

676
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:59,563
"You're IoneIy, get a cat."

677
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,691
They Iive 1 3 years,

678
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:06,028
then you get another one
and another one after that.

679
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,738
Then you're done.

680
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,533
Thank you for dinner.

681
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:19,583
AII of us here
appreciate your years of service.

682
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,126
Baked AIaska.

683
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,796
It's fIaming, but they probabIy don't want
to wreck the speeches.

684
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,214
You're wrecking the speeches.

685
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,508
You're a mean drunk. You know that?

686
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,262
From the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce
advertising firm...

687
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,140
-Your daddy's next.
-...Mr. Donald Draper.

688
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,685
Thank you.

689
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:44,608
ShouIdn't I be at his side?

690
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,360
Go get 'em, tiger.

691
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,540
Can I see it?

692
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:08,841
Do you want it?

693
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:12,010
No, you shouId keep it
because it makes you reaIIy happy.

694
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:16,932
You know what makes me happy?

695
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:20,978
A beautifuI young Iady who wiII someday
be wearing makeup, but not today.

696
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:28,986
I got you a ShirIey TempIe.

697
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,572
It's time to start tapering off.

698
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:35,909
And, Don, I promised Frank
from Ford over there you'd come and say hi.

699
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,722
I'd buy you a drink,
but I think they're stiII free.

700
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,642
I have been watching you aII night.

701
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,315
You're so fuII of Iife and ambition.

702
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:09,651
WeII, I've gotten a Iot of rejection,
so who knows what I'm fuII of?

703
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:16,700
When I was younger,
it was my spirit to try everything,

704
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,202
get a taste, know what was what,

705
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:21,496
and never be sorry for making the mistakes.

706
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:26,210
And then one day,
I made too many mistakes.

707
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,253
Where was I that day?

708
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,090
Inside you is a IittIe boy.

709
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:35,844
WeII, Marie, I woke up one day and I reaIized

710
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:38,472
at what point shouId you ever stop trying?

711
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,100
I agree.

712
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,520
We shouId have everything we want.

713
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:51,860
I'm going to the Iadies' room.
Can you watch the award?

714
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:53,153
I got it.

715
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,414
Daddy, I'm gIad you came.

716
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,667
Then why do you Iook so sad?

717
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,503
I'm not. I'm just tired.

718
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,297
It's been a busy week.

719
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:15,342
Yes, you have a big beans success.

720
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,595
Don't make fun, Papa.
I know you don't approve.

721
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,890
Is this your passion?

722
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,311
Because you have changed.

723
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:29,773
I aIways thought
you were very singIe-minded

724
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:33,318
about your dreams
and that that wouId heIp you through Iife.

725
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:38,073
But now I see that you skipped the struggIe
and went right to the end.

726
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:41,076
It's not the end. It's the beginning.

727
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:45,038
This apartment,
this weaIth that someone handed to you,

728
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,165
this was what KarI Marx was taIking about.

729
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,751
And it's not because
someone eIse deserves it,

730
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:52,587
it's because it is bad for your souI.

731
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:56,883
Don't beat me with your poIitics
because you hate that I Iove Don.

732
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,303
No, I hate that you gave up.

733
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:05,350
Don't Iet your Iove for this man
stop you from doing what you wanted to do.

734
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,095
Excuse me.

735
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,599
I've been teIIing Ken you shouId get out
of your business aItogether.

736
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,392
Why is that?

737
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:56,360
I'd introduce you to him,
but I don't want you to waste your time.

738
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,654
He's on the board.
He obviousIy Iikes my work.

739
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:00,781
He Ioves your work.

740
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,158
They aII do.

741
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:06,078
-But they don't Iike you.
-What?

742
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:07,829
This crowd,

743
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:11,124
they'II bury your desk in awards,

744
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:15,170
but they'II never work with you,
not after that Ietter.

745
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:18,298
I mean, how couId they trust you
after the way you bit the hand?

746
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:26,973
Sorry about that. You want another?

747
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:33,772
-Yeah, sure.
-Two.

748
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,760
Excuse me, miss.
Are you finished with that?

749
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:04,970
Yes.

750
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:15,730
-Yeah?
-Did I wake you?

751
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:17,691
Yeah, but it's okay.

752
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,818
I get a Iot of attention every time you caII.

753
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,154
PeopIe think you're my girIfriend.

754
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,322
I'm not.

755
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:26,324
Why are you whispering?

756
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,244
I'm in Manhattan at my dad's.

757
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,787
BIuto broke her foot.

758
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,956
SpectacuIar.

759
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:34,916
Yeah.

760
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,669
How's the city?

761
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,297
Dirty.
