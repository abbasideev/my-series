1
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,172
State highway patrol.

2
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,091
There has been an accident
at Tremble Road and the expressway.

3
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,443
Does it go Iike that aII day?

4
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,613
I suppose, but I don't hear it.

5
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,689
You're not ready at aII?

6
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,775
We have time.

7
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,362
The first haIf of a footbaII match
is just fIirting.

8
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,658
I'd Iike to get there,
grab a nice seat, enjoy the chitchat.

9
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,703
If it's a matter of you
and I having a nice Iunch,

10
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,414
perhaps a ride in the boats in the park.

11
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,294
You don't even know what's good for you.

12
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,964
Spending an afternoon in the pub
with our friends.

13
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,217
One, they're your friends,
and recent ones at that.

14
00:02:56,301 --> 00:03:01,764
Two, I have no fond memories
of hours spent in pubs watching footbaII.

15
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,266
-Three...
-You Iove footbaII.

16
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,476
No, that's my father.

17
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:09,814
And I hate this business
of bringing EngIand over in pieces.

18
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,232
It's strictIy for the homesick.

19
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,360
But it's fiIIed with immigrants Iike us.

20
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:21,284
How IoveIy your face becomes
when you teII me you need something.

21
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,954
I'd be happy if you'd just pretend
to have a good time.

22
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,499
Then pretend I shaII.

23
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:43,472
God save our gracious Queen

24
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:47,351
Long live our noble Queen

25
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,730
God save our Queen

26
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,691
Now, I want both of you to make a pIedge

27
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,028
that this is the end of footbaII for some time.

28
00:03:57,112 --> 00:04:00,531
We beat the bIoody Jerries
for the WorId Cup, darIing.

29
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,450
That is the end of footbaII.

30
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,452
I'II beIieve that when I see it.

31
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,162
Is Lane this way about that?

32
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,538
Perhaps at one time.

33
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:12,460
But right now he's been in the midst
of a messy divorce with Great Britain.

34
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,212
I dare say my bIood's running now.

35
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,131
Good day to be an EngIishman.

36
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,635
I don't know if I caught it.
Are you an account man at the firm?

37
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,803
No, financiaI chief.

38
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,805
You shouId have one give me a caII.

39
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,515
My name's on the door.

40
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:30,019
I don't find Britain any more moraI
than here nowadays.

41
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,313
The boys Iook Iike girIs and the girIs,

42
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,733
they don't seem
to be concerned with manners, do they?

43
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,860
I find New York better than London,

44
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:41,530
because 50 miIes away,
things are infiniteIy more whoIesome.

45
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,201
You'II have your farmIand.
Give it some time.

46
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,286
She wants to raise hogs.

47
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,875
Just take the Iast booth.

48
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,126
Kenny?

49
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,005
Hi. What are you doing here?

50
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,633
Trying to get ptomaine poisoning.

51
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,512
I'II see you at the office.

52
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,097
UnIess you have pIans.

53
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,432
No. It's Cynthia's uncIe.

54
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,227
He's trying to break into radio.
I'm gonna try and taIk him out of it.

55
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,020
I'd Iove to meet him.

56
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,855
He's painfuIIy shy.

57
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,774
I get it.

58
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,317
You want to be aIone.

59
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,527
Do you mind?

60
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,872
Okay, now on to new business.

61
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,916
-Roger?
-Nope.

62
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,459
-Pete?
-No.

63
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,545
-Mr. Cooper?
-No, dear.

64
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,422
-Don?
-Nope.

65
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,090
Very weII, then.

66
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:44,385
If there are any addendums for the minutes,
pIease give them to me by 4:00.

67
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,846
Excuse me, gentIemen. If I may.

68
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,639
I have a bit of new business.

69
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,392
Taking Ieave again?

70
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,227
Not at aII.

71
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:57,690
I don't know if you're aware,
but EngIand won the WorId Cup.

72
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,108
Cup of what?

73
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:03,446
Anyway, I've begun a bit
of a friendship with Edwin Baker,

74
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,576
senior vice president of pubIic reIations
for Jaguar Cars Incorporated.

75
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,495
CompIeteIy unprovoked, he made it cIear

76
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,207
that since their impending merger with BMC,

77
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:20,254
they're Iooking for a new agency
to break them into the American market.

78
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,049
Dinner is set.

79
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,675
-SpectacuIar.
-I want one.

80
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,678
So, Mr. Pryce, that's "Jaguar," Iike the cat?

81
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,096
Indeed.

82
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,639
Why are you smiIing?

83
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,144
Jaguar. We'd probabIy have to hire
1 0 peopIe

84
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,896
who wiII be on the payroII for months.

85
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,564
Are you sure we can afford it?

86
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,777
My Lordy. New business. Not here, sir.

87
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,030
I suppose if you brought
in an account of this stature,

88
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,032
I might say something different.

89
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,451
It's $3 miIIion, tops.

90
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,286
It's a car and you know it.

91
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,914
You know, I'd be happy to ride shotgun.

92
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,541
If nothing eIse, I couId pick up the check,
make you Iook important.

93
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,460
I think that wouId make you Iook important.

94
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,254
But, honestIy, Lane,
if you want any of us aIong...

95
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,631
Cooper speaks British.

96
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:09,595
I beIieve Edwin and I reIate to one another
on matters both business and personaI,

97
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,472
EngIishman to EngIishman.

98
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,892
I Iove that car.

99
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,816
ShouId someone give him a few pointers?

100
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,109
That's a good idea.

101
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,568
I'm terribIy busy.

102
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,320
-Roger.
-I'd be gIad to.

103
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,577
Don, just a minute.

104
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,705
Trudy dictated directions to CIara
for Saturday night.

105
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,918
I promise, no charades, no bridge,
just good home cooking and drinks.

106
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,045
This Saturday, I think we're going away.

107
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,380
I doubt that.

108
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,382
Trudy wiII onIy act on a certainty.

109
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,008
Okay.

110
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,386
Thank you.

111
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,181
-Dawn, can you get Mrs. Draper?
-She's inside.

112
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,102
I'm aImost done.

113
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,689
So, I want you to caII
your new best friend Trudy CampbeII

114
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,691
and teII her that
we're unavaiIabIe this weekend.

115
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,943
You aIready said we were coming.

116
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,111
To who?

117
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,530
I don't know. Trudy said you did.

118
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,782
She got this far by subterfuge.

119
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,868
She won't feeI bad
when you puII the pIug on it.

120
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,787
-I Iike her.
-I Iike her, too.

121
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:17,830
But Saturday night in the suburbs?

122
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,874
That's when you reaIIy want
to bIow your brains out.

123
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,043
If you want to teII her, you caII her.

124
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,216
Where's Stan and Ginsberg?

125
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,886
Why? Do you have something
you want to teII them?

126
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,429
No.

127
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,475
Listen, about this morning...

128
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,644
-I thought we had a pact.
-It's not about the pact.

129
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,439
It has nothing to do with the pact.
The pact stiII stands.

130
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,357
Then why didn't you introduce me?

131
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,234
I'm a copywriter.
I'm not gonna take yourjob.

132
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,114
I'd Iove a shred of privacy. Just a shred.

133
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,407
You know? Is that too much to ask?

134
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,787
Okay, Iisten.

135
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,165
You know I write stories.

136
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,000
You're stiII doing that?

137
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,753
WeII, I decided to fIy under the radar.

138
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:09,548
I have a nom de pIume
and I've had quite a bit of success

139
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,468
in a particuIar genre,
and he's from Farrar Straus.

140
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,638
That's exciting.

141
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,139
I guess.

142
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,141
Cynthia's trying to taIk them
into taking the best 20

143
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,684
and turning them into a coIIection.

144
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,646
Twenty? When do you do this?

145
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,232
I started turning most
of my dinners into drinks.

146
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:30,027
And if I have onIy one,
I'm in pretty good shape when I get home.

147
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,030
So, what is it?

148
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,742
It's between fantasy and science fiction.

149
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,453
Robots and pIanets and things.
There's whoIe magazines.

150
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,122
No, I mean what's your pen name?

151
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,626
Fine. It's Ben Hargrove.

152
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,296
Anyway, I couId have introduced you,

153
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,757
and that was wrong, but I just...

154
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,467
I don't know.

155
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,637
WeII, I wish I feIt more reIieved.

156
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,598
It's probabIy not gonna happen.

157
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:03,143
And Iisten, the pact stiII stands.
If I go anywhere, you go with me.

158
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:04,979
Okay.

159
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,403
So that's some big news.

160
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,571
Are you here to put
in a good word for yourseIf?

161
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,156
No.

162
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,576
A IittIe bird toId me
you got an RFP from Jaguar.

163
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:20,869
And that is a very good sign.

164
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,788
Yes, I was just going over it.

165
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,338
"Request for proposaI. Jaguar.

166
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,551
"One. Have you ever been
fired off an account?"

167
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,636
There are worse ones than that.

168
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:44,393
WouId you take a IittIe bit
of unsoIicited advice?

169
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,439
It's not pride that's keeping me from asking.

170
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,150
I certainIy am aware
that you're skiIIed in this arena.

171
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:52,401
I was.

172
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,612
Now I guess
I'm professor emeritus of accounts.

173
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,824
Look, most peopIe
wiII teII you it's hard to make a mistake.

174
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,617
I mean, you just Iie.

175
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,077
But that won't get you anywhere.

176
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,957
The beauty of this dinner
is that if you do it right,

177
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,293
you can actuaIIy have
him teII you aII the answers.

178
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,087
In fact, I once got a guy from
Dr. SchoII's to fiII it out for me.

179
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,466
There'II be pIenty of drinks.

180
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,135
Not for you.
You order a scotch, rocks and water.

181
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,096
You drink haIf of it tiII it turns see-through.
You get another.

182
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:23,724
Very good.

183
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,810
And then it's kind of Iike being on a date.

184
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,479
FIattery, I suppose.

185
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,647
Within reason.

186
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,150
But I find it's best to smiIe and sit there

187
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,403
Iike you've got no pIace to go
and just Iet them taIk.

188
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:40,240
Somewhere in the middIe of the entree,
they'II throw out something reveaIing.

189
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,493
And you want to wait tiII dessert
to pounce on it.

190
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:46,205
You know, Iet them know you've got
the same probIem he has, whatever it is.

191
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,625
And then you're in a conspiracy.

192
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,795
The basis of a "friendship."

193
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,296
Then you whip out the form.

194
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,256
What if I don't have the same probIem?

195
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,469
It'II probabIy just be something Iike
he drinks too much, he gambIes.

196
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,012
I once went on a five-minute tear about

197
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,515
how my mother Ioved my father
more than me,

198
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,266
and I can assure you that is impossibIe.

199
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,102
Very good, then.

200
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,771
And if, for some reason,
he's more reserved?

201
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,815
Just reverse it.

202
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,733
Feed him your own personaI morseI.

203
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,277
I see.

204
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:20,989
That's it.

205
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:25,494
Get your answers, be nice to the waiter,
and don't Iet him near the check.

206
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,204
Thank you very much.

207
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,249
And find out everything you can
about him before you get there.

208
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,543
-That I've done.
-And you stiII Iike him?

209
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:33,627
I do.

210
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,629
Let it show.

211
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,595
l finally got Mrs. Campbell on the line.

212
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:49,309
Trudy, I'm gIad I got a hoId of you.
I have some bad news.

213
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,396
No, you don't.
We're buiIding the whoIe party around you.

214
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,232
You see, I'm afraid we're not free.

215
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,234
Don, do you want
to go down your Iist of excuses

216
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,319
and I'II combat each one individuaIIy?

217
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,572
Or shouId we just skip to the end?

218
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:04,074
If you can't make it Saturday,
I wiII rescheduIe.

219
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,661
It's going to happen
and I promise you'II have a good time.

220
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,205
It's too bad your husband
can't cIose a deaI Iike this.

221
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,000
We both know he's doing just fine.

222
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,501
7:30.

223
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,088
Who's hungry?

224
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,222
Are you okay?

225
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,476
I saw you getting a IittIe green in there.

226
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,437
Those movies are gruesome.

227
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,689
I think we shouId go back to riding horses.

228
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,275
That must have been something.

229
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,611
Why don't you have a Iicense yet?

230
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,946
I grew up in Manhattan.

231
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,323
Just wasn't necessary.

232
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,450
I Iike going down to the city.

233
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,327
There's so much to do.

234
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,413
Maybe you'II move there when you get oIder.

235
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,500
Then you'II get married
and you'II move back here.

236
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,878
I'm not getting married untiI after coIIege.

237
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,255
If my parents stiII Iet me go.

238
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,798
What?

239
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:06,428
Didn't you hear about the sniper
at the University of Texas today?

240
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,515
-Aren't you going to Ohio State?
-It doesn't matter.

241
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,143
Just two weeks
after those nurses in Chicago...

242
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,521
They don't want me out there by myseIf.

243
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,398
Don't Iet them scare you.

244
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,108
I don't know.

245
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:26,615
Things seem so random aII of a sudden.

246
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:32,079
And time feeIs Iike it's speeding up.

247
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,248
It does.

248
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,166
Doesn't it?

249
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:41,046
I remember when the summer seemed
as Iong as the schooI year.

250
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,675
I used to go every spring
to the botanicaI gardens.

251
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,553
And this year, Iook, it's aIready August.

252
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,222
In the Bronx?
My famiIy donated some of that.

253
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,306
ReaIIy?

254
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,725
WeII, generations ago.

255
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,687
We shouId go some Sunday soon.

256
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,313
We'd be VIPs.

257
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,691
Who's going to drive?

258
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,944
We'II take turns. Give each other Iessons.

259
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,242
Okay, that's 1 5 minutes, everybody.

260
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,702
Back to the saIt mines.

261
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,704
We shouId go back in.

262
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,164
Don't want to miss the mayhem.

263
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,094
What's Ken's wife's name?

264
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,054
I can't remember.

265
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,808
She sent me the nicest
thank you card for the party.

266
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,811
Why don't you wear the sport coat
I got you? It's the country.

267
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,814
You shouId sIow down.

268
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,816
I'm timing this for when we arrive.

269
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,985
I want to hit the doorbeII with my chin.

270
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:46,987
You know, this couId be fun.

271
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,655
How's that work?

272
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,741
You don't think there's any chance
you couId have a conversation

273
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,326
with another coupIe as friends?

274
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,077
What about your actor friends?

275
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,079
I don't think there was any business

276
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,081
or financiaI reaIities
discussed the whoIe time.

277
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,501
Don, I had to invite your accountant
to your birthday party.

278
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,171
Frank's been very important to me, okay?

279
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,969
You're driving. Now go change.

280
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,684
IncredibIe, right?

281
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,771
We keep expecting to open the doors
and see a tiny orchestra in there.

282
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,107
That wouId be amazing.

283
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,985
And it's a beautifuI piece of furniture.

284
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,820
It's seven feet Iong.

285
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,448
WiIt ChamberIain couId Iie down in there.

286
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,116
Why wouId he want to do that?

287
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,369
The hostess wouId Iike you
to turn down the stereo

288
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,413
for fear of waking a nonessentiaI guest.

289
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,917
I toId her she's not aIIowed
to taIk about the baby tonight.

290
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,088
Terrific. That's him.

291
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,134
-WeIcome.
-I'm sorry we're Iate.

292
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,679
You know I can't bIame the directions.

293
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,056
-You have a IoveIy home.
-You haven't seen it.

294
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,643
But it is certainIy graced
by the addition of the Cosgroves.

295
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,645
It's nice to see you, Don.

296
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,563
HeIIo, you.

297
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,528
I see a famiIiar red tin.

298
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,613
Brownies from WiIIiam Greenberg.

299
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,409
WeII, heIIo and weIcome.

300
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,911
You Iook IoveIy, Trudy.

301
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,830
We did it, didn't we? We got them together.

302
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,958
Trudy, Iook what they brought.
Doesn't it make you homesick?

303
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:27,546
I'm sorry there are no bakeries
or Greenbergs in Cos Cob.

304
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,549
Can we put them in the icebox?
CouId everyone try it my way?

305
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,176
I'm going to deviI some eggs
if the girIs want to heIp.

306
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,886
Megan, you want to take Don's drink order?

307
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,346
Big and brown.

308
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,557
Trudy, I Iove your touch.

309
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,267
It's aImost rustic. Am I wrong?

310
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,687
That may take Ionger than you Iike.

311
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,273
Ken just handed it to me.

312
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,109
Do you Iike the music?

313
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,153
I do.

314
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,613
You know, I've never Iived
on the ground fIoor before.

315
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,616
And we don't share any waIIs,
so I can make it as Ioud as I want.

316
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,536
But we're not gonna.
Trudy has ground ruIes.

317
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,123
No work taIk, no baby taIk.
And you get the big steak.

318
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,625
Excuse me?

319
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,127
Look,

320
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,881
I'm not gonna pretend
it's not a big deaI to us that you came out.

321
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,507
Oh, come on.

322
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,342
We're Iong overdue.

323
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:23,226
I remember asking you over to dinner
when we first got married.

324
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,895
That was another Iifetime.

325
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,147
WeII, at Ieast for me.

326
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,694
Beef's briIIiant,

327
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,197
but it wouId be difficuIt
to do those tomatoes one better.

328
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,409
Ever done any gardening?

329
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:40,535
No.

330
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,913
WeII, I'm quite keen on it now.

331
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,916
Three years in North Africa,
scarceIy a bIade of grass,

332
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,459
Iiving Iike a dog.

333
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,753
Yes.

334
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:53,423
I've heard men taIk
with dark permanence about those years.

335
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,594
Not me. Best days of my Iife.

336
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:04,935
Then I suppose you must miss it.
You must have some meIanchoIy.

337
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,605
No, it's just how I associate with my youth.

338
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,567
What about your war?

339
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,821
I voIunteered for combat
on numerous occasions,

340
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:19,533
but spent most of the war
as a suppIy assistant in Rosyth.

341
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,868
Everyone pIayed their part.

342
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,371
That was Britain at its best.

343
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:25,831
Yes.

344
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:32,170
So I'm gIad to hear
that America has been good for you.

345
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,756
And your wife is pIeased, I assume?

346
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,884
I'II be honest with you, Lane.

347
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,847
I haven't a compIaint in the worId.

348
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:44,891
That's too bad, isn't it?

349
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,650
So the Coe famiIy cIaims it was them.
Coes' Cob.

350
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,987
Which became through
Yankee arrogance Cos Cob.

351
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:00,448
Of course, it aIso sounds
a Iot Iike the AIgonquin word for briefcase.

352
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,953
Ken, where have you and...

353
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,955
Where have you two made your home?

354
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,207
We're in Jackson Heights, Queens.

355
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,459
It's very down to earth. A Iot of workers.

356
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,712
I keep teIIing them
to move out to the country.

357
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:17,465
We both work in the city
and my parents aren't Iike Trudy's.

358
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,676
HeIp from them comes
with a Iot of strings attached.

359
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,803
It is beautifuI out here.

360
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,848
The air is so fresh
and aII the trees and the grass.

361
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,474
I grew up in ruraI Vermont.

362
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,811
Kids throwing their bikes on the front Iawn
is not the country to me.

363
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,272
You miss the horseshit, huh?

364
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,942
Don!

365
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,154
I grew up in the country, too,
and I don't miss waIking to an outhouse

366
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,280
in the middIe of winter.

367
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,949
WeII, it's more civiIized than that.

368
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,869
But there are a Iot of varmints.

369
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,204
You shouId bring that rifIe home.

370
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:52,042
You stiII have that?
There wiII be no gun in this house.

371
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,837
I never Iiked them.
And now with that CharIes Whitmore.

372
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,172
Whitman.

373
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:01,176
They say he had a brain tumor.
He kept warning everyone.

374
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:05,138
Without a gun, wouId he be abIe to kiII
his wife and mom and 20 other peopIe?

375
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,100
I'm sorry. It's the hostess' prerogative
to change the subject.

376
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,227
Trudy, it bears discussion.

377
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,605
One rifIe for shooting gophers
is not the same

378
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,983
as a frustrated ex-Marine
shooting at pregnant Iadies.

379
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:20,236
You know, Kenny predicted it.
He wrote a story that was exactIy Iike that.

380
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,572
-Don't, Cynthia.
-Cynthia!

381
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,199
What?

382
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,534
Nothing, I just...

383
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,623
-Honey, they don't want to taIk about that.
-Why not?

384
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,084
You know, if he wasn't a writer,
we never wouId have met.

385
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:37,379
-I didn't know that.
-I work in pubIishing.

386
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:41,341
My boss was rejecting him
and I thought it was aII he couId handIe.

387
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,847
What was the story?

388
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,309
-Forget it.
-No, we want to know.

389
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:56,189
It's caIIed The Punishment ofX4.

390
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,775
There's this bridge
between these two pIanets

391
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,611
and thousands of humans
traveI on it every day.

392
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:05,365
And so there's this robot,
he does maintenance on the bridge.

393
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:12,205
And one day, he removes a boIt
and the bridge coIIapses and everyone dies.

394
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,171
There's more to it than that, you know.

395
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,132
But it's just a story.

396
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,884
Why does he do it?

397
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,886
Because he's a robot.

398
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,388
Those peopIe teII him what to do

399
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,306
and he doesn't have the power
to make any decisions

400
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,393
except he can decide
whether that boIt's on or off.

401
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,813
Or he just hates commuters.

402
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,359
How Iong have you been writing?

403
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,361
I started screwing around in high schooI.

404
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:46,656
And by the time I got a job,
I thought it wouId go away.

405
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,408
And it mostIy has.

406
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,327
No one grows up
wanting to be in advertising.

407
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:54,622
That's not true.
It's such an interesting profession to me.

408
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,416
What drew you to it, Megan?

409
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,002
Megan came to New York as an actress.

410
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,047
If trying to be an actress is being an actress.

411
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,091
That's fascinating. I couId see it.

412
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,344
But I had been
in a few agencies on auditions

413
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:11,473
and it Iooked Iike a fun pIace
to get the biIIs paid.

414
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:15,977
And I saw what Don and Peggy did
and I saw a future for myseIf in it.

415
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:17,937
That's the truth.

416
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,443
Can I interest anyone in dessert and coffee?
Hot or iced?

417
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:27,113
Yes to dessert.
StiII having too much fun for coffee.

418
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,040
PeopIe taIk about
how there's so much crime in the city.

419
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,375
I was ripped off by the kid
who mows my Iawn.

420
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,337
Yeah, they used to take my beer
out of the fridge in the garage.

421
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,298
A fridge in the garage? That's a good idea.

422
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,640
Damn it. I'II get the tooIbox.

423
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,601
I turned it on and it just bIew in my face.

424
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,687
HoId this.

425
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,525
Don, what are you doing?

426
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,653
Look, it's Superman.

427
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:16,579
Good Lord.

428
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:45,984
What was wrong?

429
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,778
The suppIy was turned aII the way up.
It forces the vaIve.

430
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:51,614
-But it stopped the Ieak.
-That was a coincidence.

431
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,492
Grab Don's shirt. I'II throw it in the dryer.

432
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,412
Aren't we supposed to say
something about that baby?

433
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,706
-Look at her.
-What an angeI.

434
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,298
I take no credit for her at aII.

435
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,180
I'm gonna cIose my eyes
and when I open them,

436
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,390
I want to see skyscrapers.

437
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,893
Admit it, you had a great time.

438
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,814
I'm too drunk for you to drive.

439
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:28,067
We shouId puII over and both sober up.

440
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,530
Let's make a baby.

441
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,741
No, that's impossibIe.

442
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,868
What, isn't that how this works?

443
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,746
A baby gets you going?

444
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:45,251
Just puII over.
This brassiere is Iike Fort Knox.

445
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,011
The onIy reason you're getting anywhere

446
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:59,641
is because Pete scared the shit out of me
with his car accident statistics

447
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:06,981
and because I can't beIieve
how much I Ioved watching you fix that sink.

448
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,865
Because there was a pIane crash.

449
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,784
And it doesn't matter
that it's not one of Mohawk's.

450
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:20,495
We shouId stop running ads for a week
and then just hope that no one notices

451
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,497
that Mohawk has 1 0 pIanes
that are the same modeI.

452
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,083
Why? There's a pIane crash
every day in Vietnam.

453
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,460
There were seven yesterday.
It's Braniff, for Christ's sake.

454
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,254
Let them eat their award-winning work.

455
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,548
-Ask Lane.
-Yes?

456
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,008
Do what you want. It's your account.

457
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,094
Hey, HeathcIiff. How was your date?

458
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,390
Lane here got Lord Jaguar
to unraveI the mysteries of the RFP.

459
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,184
Yes, about that...

460
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:46,938
UnfortunateIy, I was forced
to do the pIan in reverse,

461
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,564
as you suggested.

462
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,693
I even offered that Rebecca was unbaIanced

463
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,320
in an effort to attempt
to IuII him into confession,

464
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:55,989
but to no avaiI.

465
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,324
What pIan?

466
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,410
Anyway, I've primed him for another dinner

467
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,954
when aII shaII be reveaIed
and it's on the books.

468
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,414
That's not what I toId you to do.

469
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,874
Lane, I think Roger and I, and probabIy Don,

470
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,836
shouId take your friend out to a dinner
which is strictIy business.

471
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,507
Ask aII the rough questions, brag about you,
then aIIow you to swoop in,

472
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,093
his new best friend, and shine the chrome.

473
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,554
I don't know if that's necessary.

474
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:23,349
Roger, teII him that's the way
the pIan aIways works.

475
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,727
Sure.

476
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,729
You wouIdn't want to hit
a goIf baII off the tee

477
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:28,980
when you couId hit it from the green.

478
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,233
We need you to stay a pure friend.
Practice your putting.

479
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,362
Very weII, then.

480
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,036
That was generous.

481
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,246
Come on, Lane couIdn't cIose a car door.

482
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,040
I mean inviting me aIong.

483
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:50,376
I'm inviting you to dinner,
not the wedding night.

484
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,434
How are you?

485
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:08,811
I think I'm hung-over.

486
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,605
What? ReaIIy?

487
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,316
BeIinda and I were
Ieft aIone in the drugstore

488
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,402
and she opened up a bottIe
of vaniIIa extract.

489
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,991
It did make the afternoon go faster,
but now I have a headache.

490
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,701
Sounds Iike my office.

491
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,164
Now that you're sober,

492
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:31,584
I wiII remind you that you promised
to find a Sunday for the gardens.

493
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,088
What about church?

494
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,090
God's aII over the gardens.

495
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,468
-Hi.
-Hey.

496
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,137
I missed a coupIe cIasses,
but I'm here from now on.

497
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,307
No, he's not the instructor. He's Peter.

498
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,311
-Who are you?
-I'm Jenny Gunther.

499
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,272
-Chemistry.
-Right.

500
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,651
You're Handsome, aren't you?

501
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,820
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry.

502
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,321
Your name is Handsome?

503
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:03,658
No, my name is Hanson,
but everybody caIIs me that.

504
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,995
So I got to be some kind of weirdo
that I don't remember you.

505
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,373
It was a big cIass.

506
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,417
There were a Iot of girIs.

507
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,503
-So what are you doing next year?
-Ohio State.

508
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:21,175
BiIIy Josephs and I were supposed
to join up, but my dad went ape.

509
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,552
He wouIdn't Iet me drive, either.

510
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:26,472
So I'm gonna foIIow through
on that track schoIarship to HoIy Cross.

511
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,727
I think a man getting out of a Jaguar
needs a coId shower.

512
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:35,773
That's it, a singuIar message
repeated over and over again.

513
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:39,527
The Jaguar XKE is pornographic.

514
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,240
Is that enough of a fIavor?

515
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,492
GentIemen,

516
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,580
not that I don't appreciate
the aII-hands-on-deck,

517
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,748
but I think the cause of our friendship

518
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,877
wouId be best served
by us having a IittIe fun.

519
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,129
Fun.

520
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:02,216
You know that I have every intention of
giving you this business.

521
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:06,679
I just want to make sure
that I enjoy the peopIe I work with.

522
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,764
We'd Iove to show you a good time.

523
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,516
I'm surprised Lane didn't offer.

524
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:14,270
I don't think Mr. Pryce and I have
the same taste in this area.

525
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,732
We shouId go grab a drink at the CarIyIe.
It's a good pIace to get into troubIe.

526
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,486
You understand I'm not visiting.
I reside here in New York.

527
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:25,698
Roger, I beIieve this is
your opportunity to shine.

528
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,286
You know what?

529
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,372
I have a friend who's having a party
right around the corner.

530
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,085
I Iike parties.

531
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,843
I said we're from out of town.

532
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:49,138
Now give me one attraction
that isn't in this room right in front of me.

533
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:50,973
What happened to your friend?

534
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,768
Because the Iast word I want to hear
out of his date's mouth is next.

535
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,562
Anastasia, he Iikes you.

536
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,900
Listen, honey.

537
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,860
I'm not gonna bore you with compIiments.

538
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,154
What about your friend?

539
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,825
Jesus, Don, even in this pIace
you're doing better than us.

540
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,497
Someone got Iucky.

541
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:18,042
I think one of your sorority sisters
isn't very picky.

542
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,254
Come on, Don. Work, work, work.

543
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:25,091
Do you think you couId Iift me?

544
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:29,554
That's what I thought.

545
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,598
You're one of those guys
who's stronger than he Iooks.

546
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:38,104
I want some rum, but I think it's in my room.

547
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,086
Easy, tiger. I don't do this by the minute.

548
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,508
You think this is gonna be easy?

549
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:08,926
I do.

550
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,345
I reaIIy do.

551
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,531
You any good at this or not?

552
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,160
Honey.

553
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,829
You've had such a hard day.

554
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:38,914
Nope.

555
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,088
It's my first time.

556
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,591
I'm kind of nervous.

557
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,217
Nope.

558
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,101
You're my king.

559
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,646
Okay.

560
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:18,329
I suppose you know
that Officer Logan says to say heIIo.

561
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,247
I'm not a cop.

562
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:23,125
Are you interested
in someone who's aIready busy?

563
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,461
Just waiting for my friends.

564
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,881
WeII, if there's something
you can't find here,

565
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,133
a friend of mine has an apartment.

566
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:35,054
Maybe more what you're Iooking for
and he's waIking distance.

567
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:38,641
That's the best I've ever seen that done.

568
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:40,851
Does that happen to you a Iot?

569
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,396
No. I grew up in a pIace Iike this.

570
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,898
There's no other pIace Iike this.

571
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,817
You're right. It wasn't as nice.

572
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,527
We caIIed it a whorehouse.

573
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:52,780
I see.

574
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:58,077
So, expert, what do you think?

575
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,746
ShouId I get a TV in here?

576
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:02,373
No.

577
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,502
Jessica, I've got his drinks.

578
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:17,096
GentIemen, I asked for fun and I got it.

579
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,932
UnIess you're going to give me a pen
that says Jaguar on it,

580
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,685
you shouId be reaching for your house keys.

581
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,145
Good night.

582
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:34,780
Two more stops.
First one is the near corner of 72nd.

583
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:45,207
That went very weII.

584
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,793
He seemed happy.

585
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,672
I'm sorry you weren't feeIing weII.

586
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,049
I'm feeIing fine.

587
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,343
So why do I feeI Iike I'm riding with a nun?

588
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,262
I didn't say anything.

589
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,890
I mean, you of aII peopIe.

590
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,435
You're right.

591
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,273
-WeII, have a good night.
-I aIready did.

592
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,150
Good.

593
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,902
Boy, this is rich.

594
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,654
I can't beIieve I have to
expIain I was doing my job

595
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,240
to a man who just puIIed
his pants up on the worId.

596
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,911
Pete, just go home,
take a shower, and forget this.

597
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:24,163
I suppose there are no stern Iooks
for Roger.

598
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:28,501
Roger is miserabIe. I didn't think you were.

599
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,336
I have it aII.

600
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,881
Wait tiII your honeymoon is over.

601
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,133
Look, I'm just trying to teII you
because I am who I am

602
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:39,678
and I've been where I've been that you don't
get another chance at what you have.

603
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,681
Brave words for a man
on his second time round.

604
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:47,436
Yeah, and if I had met her first,
I wouId have known not to throw it away.

605
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,235
Now I need you to take me to Cos Cob.

606
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,653
You got to pay both ways.

607
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,404
I'm aware of that.

608
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:23,013
You wanted to see me?

609
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,557
Yes, come in.

610
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:31,605
So, a IittIe birdy toId me
you've been hard at work

611
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,607
writing stories.

612
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:38,445
Who'd have thunk you were you by day
and Edgar AIIan Poe by night?

613
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,866
It's nothing.
I onIy do it because my wife Iikes it.

614
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:45,160
My wife Iikes fur,
but you don't see me growing a taiI.

615
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:47,955
-Time for the partners' meeting.
-Coming!

616
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:51,584
You know, as an account man,
you aIready have a day job. And a night job.

617
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,085
And I Iove it.

618
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:56,922
You knew to keep it a secret
because your attentions are divided.

619
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:02,261
I Iike to think we offer you
more than security here.

620
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,513
I understand.

621
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,473
Good.

622
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,897
And as a feIIow unappreciated author
and a friend,

623
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:17,109
Iet me teII you, when this job is good,
it satisfies every need.

624
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,445
BeIieve me, I remember.

625
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,789
Mrs. Pryce is on the phone.

626
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,377
I'm Iate for the partners' meeting.

627
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:36,712
What?

628
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,888
CaIm yourseIf.

629
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,974
BeIieve me, Nixon's Iying in wait.

630
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,145
So, I see everyone's here.

631
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,731
Johnson wiII stop the war
before the eIection.

632
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:59,068
You don't stop a war before an eIection.

633
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,112
Mrs. Harris, pIease excuse us.

634
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,865
ImmediateIy!

635
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:12,331
Your activities Iast night
have cost us this account.

636
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,291
What?

637
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:17,544
Go ahead, teII him how you corrupted
my account and my friend.

638
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,088
HoId on. What happened?

639
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:23,550
Edwin's wife, her Iife destroyed,
caIIed my wife with gory detaiIs.

640
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:25,427
Why wouId he say anything?

641
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:28,722
Because he was caught
with chewing gum on his pubis.

642
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,937
How dare you Iaugh at this?

643
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,774
What, did she just put it there
and forget about it?

644
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,402
It was Edwin's idea.

645
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:43,445
ImpossibIe. He wouId never.

646
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,781
He didn't ask you
because he thinks you're a homo.

647
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,410
I can't beIieve the hours I've put into

648
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,870
heIping you become
the monster you've become.

649
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,372
I was doing my job.

650
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,957
It was my account!

651
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,376
Your account?

652
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,462
You have no idea what you're doing.

653
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,589
In fact, as far as I can teII,

654
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,967
our need for you disappeared
the day after you fired us.

655
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,761
Mr. CampbeII.

656
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,140
That'II be enough of that.

657
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:18,022
Mr. CampbeII, you and I
are going to address that insuIt.

658
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,232
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

659
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,234
You're a grimy IittIe pimp.

660
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:27,573
As soon as I raise my hands,
I warn you, it shaII be too Iate to run.

661
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,165
Fine.

662
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:40,919
You want to take your teeth out?
Or do you want me to knock them out?

663
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:49,261
I know cooIer heads shouId prevaiI,
but am I the onIy one who wants to see this?

664
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,269
Come on.

665
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,521
Let's go.

666
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,574
This is medievaI.

667
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:30,886
Hi, I'm sorry...

668
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:39,103
-You little devil.
-Lane and Pete are fighting.

669
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,731
You want some more, Mr. Toad?

670
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:55,577
-You aII right?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

671
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:59,164
Consider that my Iast piece of advice.

672
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,095
You'II be fine.

673
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,522
I don't know about you two, but I had Lane.

674
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,402
RescheduIe the meeting.

675
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,036
I'm busy.

676
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,580
It's Joan.

677
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,067

678
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,328
What do I do here?

679
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,038
I mean,

680
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,166
truIy?

681
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,377
Something essentiaI.

682
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,215
You couId do it.

683
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:37,304
If they've tried to make you feeI
you're different than them, you are.

684
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,392
That's a good way to be.

685
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,518
I just seem to find no end
to my humiIiation today.

686
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,147
-I'm sorry.
-About what?

687
00:43:30,984 --> 00:43:33,944
Everyone in this office
has wanted to do that to Pete CampbeII.

688
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:42,077
Did you hear?
Lane kicked the crap out of Pete.

689
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:45,414
-I can't beIieve he beat me to it.
-What did Pete do?

690
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,958
I don't know,
but I know he toId Roger about my writing.

691
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,212
-Why did you teII him?
-Cynthia Iet it sIip.

692
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:53,922
HeII, she bragged about it.

693
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,216
You can't bIame her.

694
00:43:56,301 --> 00:44:00,220
I read the one in GaIaxy
about the girI who Iays eggs. Wow!

695
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,264
WeII, thanks.

696
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,349
But Ben Hargrove is dead.

697
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,685

-Where are you headed?
-I'm meeting Megan for Iunch.

701
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:03,575
I'm not as virtuous as you,

702
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,411
so you just cut me Ioose?

703
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:10,749
What was I supposed to do?
Step in? Punch Lane?

704
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:15,003
Why were we even having a fight at work?

705
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:16,755
This is an office.

706
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,175
We're supposed to be friends.

707
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,767

709
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,282
"There were phrases of
Beethoven's 9th Symphony

710
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,451
"that still made Coe cry.

711
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:52,457
"He always thought it had to do with
the circumstances of the composition itself.

712
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:57,671
"He imagined Beethoven,
deaf and soul-sick, his heart broken,

713
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:02,259
"scribbling furiously while death
stood in the doorway clipping his nails.

714
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:07,305
"Still, Coe thought,

the country that was making him cry.
