1
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:06,315
What are you doing? l'll make breakfast.

2
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,196
Don, you're gonna be late.

3
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:16,534
Damn it.

4
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,375
-Bonjour, Marie.
-Would you like an omelet?

5
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:26,252
l'd better not.

6
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,962
You can't eat an egg?

7
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:29,505
Do l have to call the dentist?

8
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,924
lt'll go away. lt always does.

9
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,969
Go easy on the mouthwash.

10
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,346
Have fun.

11
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,810
Why bother him?

12
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,520
With what?

13
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,735
"We're sorry that there's been
no response to your reel.

14
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,615
"We would encourage you to try our
advanced film workshop for a low..."

15
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,241
What is it?

16
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,661
l paid for a screen test.

17
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,498
They were supposed to send it to agents.

18
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,292
And they weren't interested?

19
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,420
How could they have
sent it to anybody but me in a week?

20
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:11,172
They're selling classes.

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,675
lt's a great thing
to take advantage of hopeless people.

22
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:16,886
Hopeless?

23
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,607
Beth, l don't know
if you remember Pete Campbell.

24
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,610
Of course. We almost had dinner.

25
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,825
How was the second honeymoon?
Did you create another beneficiary?

26
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,577
So where are you off to?

27
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,206
She's gonna stay
with her sister for a little bit.

28
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,791
And where is that?

29
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:50,586
You know what, honey?
l'm going to the smoker.

30
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,798
-We'll have to stand.
-You don't have to come.

31
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,010
Don't take it personally.

32
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,972
She's in a mood.

33
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,977
Excuse me. Can l just get by here, please?

34
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,062
-Go right ahead.
-Thank you.

35
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,824
Morning.

36
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,036
-38? Where are you going?
-l made a mistake.

37
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:26,789
Okay.

38
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,835
Because l heard that
the parachute company upstairs

39
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,962
got a big government contract
and moved to Washington

40
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,797
to be closer to the cemetery or something.

41
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,592
For once, mind your own business, Harry.

42
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,889
All l'm saying is if we're getting more space,
l'll take anything without a column in it.

43
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,766
We offered you another office
and you turned it down.

44
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,352
You didn't want his office either.

45
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,229
So is it true or not?

46
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,403
l need a window, Joan. l'm getting scurvy.

47
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,785
Adam?

48
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:16,130
Topaz. Always less expensive. Never cheap.

49
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,969
-l hate it.
-No, you don't.

50
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,638
So we're aiming for cheap girls?

51
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,098
-Girl's not cheap.
-So we're cheap.

52
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,309
Art, come on.
We agreed on a value approach.

53
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,645
-l hate the word "cheap."
-And so do l!

54
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,813
That's why l put the word
"never" in front of it.

55
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,649
You say the word, you put it on their mind.

56
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,070
l hate to quote you directly,

57
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,323
but didn't you say that with Topaz,
a girl could be sexy for pocket change?

58
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,533
l thought it was gonna be
"Two for one, twice the fun."

59
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,118
That really sounds cheap.

60
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,828
Perhaps Don can answer this.

61
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,247
Gentlemen, how are you?

62
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,334
Art and Marvin object to the word "cheap."

63
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,672
You're aware the word
does not refer to Topaz.

64
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,384
Clearly it states the exact opposite.
And it's very funny.

65
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,636
We're supposed to be part of a fantasy,

66
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,013
and l don't think cheap
is part of any girl's fantasy.

67
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,890
Why don't you get a girl's opinion?

68
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,809
l used to take that as a given here.

69
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,186
And l'm not talking about
black coffee out there.

70
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,691
-We're happy to copy test it for you.
-What's that gonna cost?

71
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,818
They're not charging us.
They should've done it already.

72
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,778
-Let me walk you out.
-See you soon.

73
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,952
Why the hell didn't you get any research?

74
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,829
Because we never had
to do it for them before.

75
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,623
The client didn't like it and we did.

76
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,291
ln the end, isn't that
how we know it's good?

77
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,585
-Then this is a success.
-l consider it a success.

78
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,255
You didn't have to go a single day
without telling me l'm an idiot.

79
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,551
l'll tell you what,
l'm so bored of this dynamic.

80
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,639
l have your sister-in-law.

81
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,727
-Hello, Judy.
-No, it's me.

82
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:55,604
Beth.

83
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,190
-l know who it is.
-l have to see you.

84
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,817
Jesus, l'm at work.

85
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:05,072
Clara, could you go to the lobby
and get me a pack of Life Savers?

86
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,907
What's wrong with the machine?

87
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,285
l want them fresh.

88
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:13,247
So you ran into me on the train
and suddenly remember who l was?

89
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:17,668
Meet me where you wanted to meet before,
the Hotel Pennsylvania.

90
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:20,546
l'll be there at noon
under the name Mrs. Campbell.

91
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,424
l hope you like waiting. That's what l did.

92
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,093
This may be our last chance.

93
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,018
Why is this so hard?

94
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,647
lt has to be 1 25 words
and 1 5 of them have to be "Ajax."

95
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,776
Fellas, can l have Miss Olson
to myself for a minute?

96
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,781
Do you smoke?

97
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:47,907
Not really.

98
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,116
Well, get started.

99
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,744
Smoke it, name it, sell it.

100
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:52,995
What is it?

101
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,790
Philip Morris' top secret ladies' cigarette.

102
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,042
Leo Burnett thinks it's too small,
and now it's in review.

103
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,211
So it's yourjob to make sure they're sorry.

104
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,171
-Great.
-Evan!

105
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,550
Flip through the research at your leisure
and then get your little ones on it.

106
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,928
Did they tell you anything l should know?

107
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:11,680
Does your boyfriend light your cigarettes?

108
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,641
-l don't smoke.
-Yes, you do.

109
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,894
lt's gotta make noise.
Maybe she lights it herself.

110
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,481
So is that what it is,
or is it something like that?

111
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,984
You're a woman and you smoke.
What do you want?

112
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:31,075
All of last year's third
and fourth quarters' work has posted

113
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,912
with sizeable checks from Vicks,
Sugarberry and Heinz in the bank.

114
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,082
And with Mohawk returning
to its prestrike billings,

115
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:42,211
revenues are up 34% from last year,
making this our best quarter.

116
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,672
lt's March. lt's our only quarter.

117
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,133
Not this year. Ever.

118
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,176
And with Jaguar due to run

119
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,887
and Butler shooting
and running within the month,

120
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,182
projections for next quarter
are equally bright.

121
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,059
Have you found me an office?

122
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,354
Unfortunately, l was unable
to go upstairs this morning.

123
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,605
Harry Crane.

124
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,941
But l am meeting
with the building manager at lunch.

125
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,860
Get more than we need.

126
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,570
Any objections?

127
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,623
l'm sorry, but l feel
someone has to voice the negatives.

128
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,794
Perhaps after one quarter, we should be
careful not to overextend ourselves.

129
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,045
Can we just vote?

130
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,798
Or we could table
this discussion until June.

131
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,134
-All in favor of tabling the vote?
-Aye.

132
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,470
Tabling does not require a vote.
lt only needs to be seconded.

133
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,182
-What is this, parliament?
-ls this meeting over yet?

134
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,349
No, it's not.

135
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,935
Don, l give you my proxy.
l have things to do.

136
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,109
We can do that?

137
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,291
Thank God.

138
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,834
Stop it.

139
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,713
-l knew you'd show.
-Because l'm pathetic?

140
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,301
lf you're so angry, why did you come?

141
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,929
You know l had to.

142
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,351
Come sit with me.

143
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,277
l'm not going to my sister's.

144
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,950
l... Well, Howard checked me
into the hospital this morning.

145
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,285
For what? What's wrong?

146
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,916
lt's hard to explain, but l've been very blue

147
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:49,463
and the doctors seem to think
the only thing to do is electroshock.

148
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,716
Shock treatment? You're not crazy.

149
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:58,931
Look, Peter, l wanted to see you
because it's going to be different after.

150
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,891
lt always is.

151
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,936
You've done it before?

152
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,646
Yes.

153
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,984
And it creates this sort of gray cloud.

154
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,444
The last time, l lost months and...

155
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,864
This is wonderful. You're wonderful.

156
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,953
l don't want to forget and l'm afraid l will.

157
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,918
l told them l was going
to my niece's birthday party.

158
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,587
l have to be back by 5:00
so l'll be ready for tomorrow.

159
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,174
What makes you think l would do this?
You are crazy.

160
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,012
Please.

161
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,849
Please give me this.

162
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,031
Oh, God.

163
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,454
Why does everybody want redheads?

164
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:07,041
Anybody can become a redhead.
l mean, even Julia's working.

165
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,834
Working?

166
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,546
She did three days on Dark Shadows
and then they fired her and cut her out.

167
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,341
Shit. l keep telling her how good she was.

168
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:22,306
This is why you're not working.
You won't answer the phone.

169
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,020
Hello?

170
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,855
l can hear you.

171
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,568
Heavy breathing?

172
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,570
l thought it was a wrong number,
but they keep calling

173
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,405
and they never say they're sorry.

174
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,700
l wish you would have told me
we had company.

175
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,327
l wouldn't have come out like this.

176
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,120
Hello. Nice to meet you.

177
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,790
-Mother, this is Emily from class.
-Pleasure.

178
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,501
Megan, did you get me an appointment
for a wash and set?

179
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,794
Yes, Mama.

180
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,546
-How long are you in town for?
-Only a week.

181
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:58,759
l wanted to spend Easter with my daughter.
My husband is an atheist.

182
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,552
What are your plans for today?

183
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,431
-We are looking at the casting notices.
-Bonne chance.

184
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,478
She's so elegant and encouraging.

185
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,271
l guess so.

186
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,775
Listen.

187
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:22,533
l hope you know that if l could ever help you
in any way, l would want you to ask.

188
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,451
Okay.

189
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:29,790
My agent put me up for this part.
lt's really cute.

190
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,251
lt's based on Beauty and the Beast

191
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,796
and, well, it's a commercial
for Barnett shoes.

192
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:37,673
And?

193
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,135
Don's the Draper
in Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, isn't he?

194
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,430
-Do you mean Butler shoes?
-Yes, that's it.

195
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,850
Look, l really don't want
to make you uncomfortable.

196
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,811
l am completely prepared for no. l just...

197
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,355
lt' a European type.

198
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:59,486
l'm sorry, but Don doesn't do that.
That's not the way it works.

199
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,321
lt's really up to the client.

200
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,532
All l want is an audition.

201
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,326
l'd ask you who l have to sleep with,
but l don't think you'd like it.

202
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,999
Okay. l'll see what l can do.

203
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,211
l am your eternal slave.

204
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,089
But if it doesn't work out,

205
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,008
you're gonna have to act
like you never asked.

206
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,384
Now find me a job.

207
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,353
l should go.

208
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,899
Howard's coming by after work.

209
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,234
lt was terrible.

210
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,196
l couldn't find the party,
then l couldn't get a cab.

211
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,448
For four hours?

212
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:59,046
Don't tell me you're not happy right now.
Don't tell me you don't feel better.

213
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,810
Howard can't make you do this.

214
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,024
He wants to control you. He's a monster.

215
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,653
You just hate him
because he voted for Goldwater.

216
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,905
This is not a joke.

217
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:29,701
Let's go to Los Angeles. l've been there.
lt's filled with sunshine.

218
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,745
l can't.

219
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,040
Why?

220
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,087
lt's so dark, Peter,

221
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,548
that l just

222
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:48,136
get to this place
and l suddenly feel this door open

223
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,265
and l wanna walk through it.

224
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,518
That's for weak people,

225
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,563
people who can't solve a problem.

226
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,483
You want to solve a problem? Zip me up.

227
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,289
And then you'll leave.

228
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:20,085
-And what if you forget you love me?
-Peter.

229
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,964
l don't know you and you don't know me.

230
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,176
We just happen to have the same problem.

231
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,096
l know, but we're only sad
because we're apart.

232
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,851
Then l was wrong.

233
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,313
l really should go.

234
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:40,647
Why?

235
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,067
Because it works.

236
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:45,944
Really?

237
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,038
Five more minutes.

238
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,632
-Hello.
-How are you feeling?

239
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,508
-Better.
-Good.

240
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,093
Just in case, l made soup.

241
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,429
l'll change for dinner.

242
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,891
We'll be right out.

243
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,066
Are you really feeling better?
l didn't get a kiss.

244
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,984
l swear l'm better.

245
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,871
Emily was telling me that Butler shoes
is shooting a new commercial.

246
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,998
"Beauty and the Beast."

247
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,712
Well, she said they're looking
for a European girl.

248
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,547
And l was thinking,

249
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:52,010
well, l'd be mad at myself if l didn't ask,

250
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,805
and, well, l wouldn't ask

251
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,183
if l didn't think l'd be right for it,
but l really am.

252
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,936
What?

253
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,695
All l want you to do is put my name in a pile.

254
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,822
l know they're gonna wanna see
what l look like on film

255
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,865
and l happen to have it.

256
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,536
You wanna be in a commercial?

257
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,413
l wanna work.

258
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,165
lt's in town, so l'd be home for dinner.

259
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,585
-l thought you hated advertising.
-l never said that.

260
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,715
Well, you certainly don't think it's art.
And you're an artist, aren't you?

261
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,467
Are you mad at me?

262
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,136
l'm just surprised.

263
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,972
lt's not theater, it's not Broadway,
it's not film.

264
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:41,351
A national commercial?
All my friends would kill for it.

265
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,438
-You'd get in the union, you'd get exposure.
-You'd get money.

266
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,273
That's why they want it. You don't need that.

267
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,944
Do you know how hard this was
for me to even ask you?

268
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,073
Do you know how hard it would be to ask
Charles Butler Jr. to hire my wife?

269
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,368
l just want an audition. l'll be Megan Calvet.

270
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,414
Ken, Stan and Ginsberg are gonna be there.
They know who you are.

271
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,627
-l'm gonna call the dentist.
-No. l'm better.

272
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:13,008
Listen, just forget l brought any of this up.

273
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,260
lt's just...

274
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,972
lt's been so hard, you know.

275
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:28,023
l do. Look, you don't want it this way.

276
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,234
You wanna be somebody's discovery,
not somebody's wife.

277
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,323
You're right. l know you're right.

278
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,287
-Aren't you gonna get it?
-No. They've been hanging up all day.

279
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,085
Hello?

280
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,254
Who is this?

281
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,673
-Hello, is Marie there?
-Emile?

282
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,384
Marie, s'il vous plait.

283
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,345
lt's your father. l think he's drunk.

284
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:03,517
Hello?

285
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,851
Daddy's on the phone.

286
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,357
-AIIô, Emile.
-She's got it.

287
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,860
Marie, it's Roger.

288
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,704
Marie, it's Roger Sterling.
l've used up all the French l know.

289
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,340
What is Regina?

290
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,931
Thank you.

291
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,852
Megan, you know l would if l could.

292
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,563
Of course.

293
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,566
l'm gonna take a bath before dinner.

294
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,838
How did you know l was here?

295
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,549
Because Don was complaining
you were drinking all his liquor.

296
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,635
So you wanted to see me?

297
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,429
You could have arranged a dinner
for the four of us.

298
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,598
Really? You'd do that?

299
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,850
No, because l'm not that kind of woman.

300
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,019
No, no, of course you're not.

301
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,770
lt's just, well, l enjoy your company

302
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,732
and l thought if you were willing
to broach impropriety ever so slightly,

303
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,859
l could have dinner
brought to my apartment.

304
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,652
The kid from room service can chaperone.

305
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,697
Room service? ls it a hotel?

306
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:44,034
The Stanhope.
And you can just ask for me in the lobby.

307
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,327
lt's very discreet.

308
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,370
They just send the girls right up?

309
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,581
Look, l called you.

310
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,459
ln fact, l had hung up on your daughter
about a dozen times today.

311
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:56,463
l'm not asking for anything more
than a little conversation, l swear.

312
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,050
l'll try to get away

313
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:03,094
on the condition
that you lower your expectations.

314
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,263
Below conversation?

315
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,095
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

316
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,347
How are you feeling?

317
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,474
-Could you get me some ice?
-Right away.

318
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,144
Mrs. Harris wants to see you.
She's been waiting in there quite a while.

319
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,400
Morning.

320
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,652
What can l do for you?

321
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,323
l want to reopen the conversation
about more space.

322
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,033
You're not gonna put anybody
in here, are you?

323
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:08,368
No.

324
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:13,498
lt's just l've been trying so hard
to be so responsible and careful

325
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,292
and l don't even know why,

326
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:19,587
because every day l open the mail
and there's more money.

327
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,715
That's the idea, isn't it?

328
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,134
l got this this morning.

329
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:31,558
The death benefit
from the company insurance policy.

330
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:34,561
lt's $1 75,000.

331
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,604
So what's your question?

332
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,775
Why would he do that?

333
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,863
You'll never get an answer.
You can't think about that.

334
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:49,909
But l do. And then l can't stop it.
What could l have done?

335
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,245
Nothing.

336
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,290
lt's not true.

337
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,918
Why didn't l give him what he wanted?

338
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,879
What did he want?

339
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,096
And now there's this, this profit.

340
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,224
How much did he put in for collateral
after Lucky Strike left?

341
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:14,851
$50,000.

342
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,394
We should pay that back.

343
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,397
-Shouldn't we have a vote?
-No.

344
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,066
Cut a check to his wife.

345
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,612
Are you under the weather?

346
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,447
l have a hot tooth.

347
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:30,992
l know a dentist.
He's in the steeple of the Chrysler Building.

348
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,286
Even if he can't help you,
you still get to see the view.

349
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,579
lt'll go away.

350
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:39,667
l have your ice.

351
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,544
l'll take that.

352
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,422
Put that on your face, not in a drink.

353
00:23:56,227 --> 00:24:00,438
l don't feel well.
Just go to The Cloisters without me.

354
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,536
No, Mother.

355
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,663
l'm sad.

356
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,665
l know.

357
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,169
What do l do?

358
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:39,102
Why are you always so nice to strangers?
You don't ever care what l wanna do.

359
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,025
You're supposed to be encouraging.

360
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:50,405
Not every little girl
gets to do what they want.

361
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:53,324
The world could not support
that many ballerinas.

362
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,702
ls that what you tell yourself?

363
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,389
l'm sorry to drop by like this.

364
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:20,727
lf l sound distracted, it's only because
l'm waiting for a bed to be delivered.

365
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,146
My mother is coming to stay.

366
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,356
That should be helpful.

367
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,775
-May l?
-Of course.

368
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,697
l'd offer you something,
but l have nothing in the house.

369
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:39,370
First, let me offer my apologies.

370
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,040
But with the funeral abroad

371
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:45,210
and you declining our offer
to have a memorial,

372
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:48,004
l really haven't been sure
how to express our condolences.

373
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:52,550
lt may be the difference in our cultures,
but we're not ones to wallow.

374
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,763
Well, l'm not sure if you're aware,

375
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:01,643
but last year the partners
were required to put up collateral.

376
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:05,021
And although the firm
has six years to repay,

377
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:09,067
it was unanimous that we try
and help you through this difficult time.

378
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,585
Again, l'm very sorry for your loss.

379
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,880
Yes, l hope you feel better.

380
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,341
l think it'll make a difference.

381
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,509
How much is it?

382
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,135
$50,000.

383
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,973
You had no right to fill
a man like that with ambition.

384
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,979
l found this in his wallet.

385
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,816
Who is this?

386
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,946
-l don't know.
-Don't just consider the office.

387
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,031
Think of all the brothels you frequent.

388
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,702
-l should go.
-Yes, perhaps you should.

389
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,751
l'm truly sorry for your loss.

390
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,753
lt's probably difficult for you to believe,

391
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:14,924
but it was even more than $50,000
that already belonged to him,

392
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,384
so don't leave here thinking

393
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,095
that you've done anything for anyone
but yourself.

394
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,700
Hello.

395
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:44,871
Say hi to Daddy.

396
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:49,167
The table's set in there.
l wanted to leave these out for you.

397
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:52,545
What is this?

398
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:54,630
They're the plans for the pool.

399
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,883
They can start in May right after the rain.

400
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:58,676
That's you.

401
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:03,222
-l don't know, Trudy. lt's awfully permanent.
-l know.

402
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,391
lt'll add tremendous value to the property.

403
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,685
And Lord knows you're so much better
when you get some sun.

404
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,563
Tammy could drown.

405
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,981
What is wrong with you?

406
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:13,733
l'm sorry.

407
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,069
This doom and gloom, l'm tired of it.

408
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,797
Not one thing you said was true.

409
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,884
No dinner, no chaperone, no conversation.

410
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,095
Stop being demure.
You're already on the bed.

411
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,186
l hoped that you would call.

412
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,064
And l hoped that you would come.

413
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,316
And not just for obvious reasons.

414
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,277
l don't believe you.

415
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:04,325
You know, one of my partners,
he ended it all.

416
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:11,499
You'd have to be so sure you were going
someplace better, wouldn't you?

417
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,544
But l think maybe that place is here.

418
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,297
Why are you saying this?

419
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,842
Would you take LSD with me?

420
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,052
What?

421
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:26,973
l love that you're so calm,
but you're adventurous.

422
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:32,937
And honestly, l need to take it again
to really appreciate here

423
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,398
and l don't wanna do it alone.

424
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,734
And l think if you were there,
then it'd be okay.

425
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,614
Roger, please don't ask me for anything.

426
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,325
Please don't ask me to take care of you.

427
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,920
ls there anything else l can do?

428
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,727
There you are, right where you are.

429
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,191
l missed you.

430
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,906
Jesus. Come on.

431
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,366
Let's get you to bed.

432
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:31,871
-Where's your mother?
-She abandoned me.

433
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,505
You can't even kiss me?

434
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:45,051
Just go to the dentist,
because l need you right now.

435
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,094
-Megan.
-Please.

436
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,765
lt's the only thing l'm good for.

437
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,017
What the hell happened today?

438
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,855
This is what you want, isn't it?
For me to be waiting for you.

439
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,733
That's why you won't give me a chance.

440
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,027
That's not true.

441
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,488
l know, l know.

442
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,783
Because it's either that or l'm terrible.

443
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,411
But how the hell would you know?

444
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,664
You're really drunk.

445
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:19,794
Sleep it off.

446
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,597
Where were you?

447
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,474
l have friends in New York.

448
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,269
How could you leave her like that,
drunk out of her mind?

449
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:39,146
She's married to you. That's yourjob.

450
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,607
She left my house a happy girl.

451
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,818
And you show up and she's miserable.

452
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,571
l know it's hard to watch,

453
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:49,365
but this is what happens
when you have the artistic temperament

454
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,325
but you are not an artist.

455
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,536
Take my advice,

456
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,498
nurse her through this defeat
and you shall have the life you desire.

457
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,129
l have postcards to write.

458
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:29,488
You almost had a nasty abscess.

459
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:32,283
You should have had it extracted days ago.

460
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,660
l kept thinking it would go away.

461
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:37,538
Yeah? You're lucky you didn't lose yourjaw.

462
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,794
Just breathe through your nose.

463
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,811
You're in bad shape, Dick.

464
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,649
What are you doing here?

465
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,360
l lost my job when l died.

466
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,490
l'm gonna do you a favor and take it out.

467
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,661
But it's not your tooth that's rotten.

468
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,579
Don't go.

469
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,750
Don't leave me.

470
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,087
Don't worry.

471
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,047
l'll hang around.

472
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,799
Get it?

473
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:41,519
You're gonna be sore,
so just take it easy for the rest of the day.

474
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:47,066
Fill that prescription l gave you
and don't smoke for 24 hours.

475
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:57,576
Mrs. Dawes?

476
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,831
Beth, your brother's here to see you.

477
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,210
Yes, of course. Come in.

478
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,259
You know, you're right.

479
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,761
You really do have the same eyes.

480
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,013
l'm so glad you came.

481
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:22,768
How are you feeling?

482
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,604
l don't have a brother.

483
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,606
lt was the only way l could get in.

484
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:30,443
But what are you doing here?

485
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,946
Well, l was worried about you.

486
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,033
That's right.

487
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:44,915
l'm sorry.

488
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:47,752
l'm in the wrong room.

489
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,879
But you can still visit.

490
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,757
But l'm here to visit my friend.

491
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,009
Please.

492
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,261
Please, keep me company.

493
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,648
What's wrong with your friend?

494
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:13,986
He...

495
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:22,870
He got involved

496
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,665
with another man's wife.

497
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,587
And that put him in the hospital?

498
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,467
From the complications.

499
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,680
Why did he do it?

500
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:48,562
Well, all the regular reasons, l guess.

501
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,357
He needed to let off some steam,

502
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:54,610
he needed adventure,
he needed to feel handsome again.

503
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,863
He needed to feel that he knew something,

504
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,074
that all this aging was worth something

505
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,827
because he knew things
young people didn't know yet.

506
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:08,332
He probably thought it would be like
having a few tall drinks

507
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,167
and feeling very, very good.

508
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:12,920
And then he'd go back to his life and say,

509
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,841
"That was nice."

510
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,386
But then he got sick?

511
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,557
When it went away,

512
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,560
he was heartbroken.

513
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:34,692
And then he realized everything
he already had was not right either

514
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,571
and that was why it had happened at all.

515
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,701
And that his life with his family was some

516
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,664
temporary bandage on a permanent wound.

517
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,171
Don't worry.

518
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,466
They'll fix him up here.

519
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,052
They're very good.

520
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,601
He'll be fine.

521
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,115
Well, it was nice to meet you.

522
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,452
Good luck with your friend.

523
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,813
Oh, my goodness.

524
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,943
How are you?

525
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,321
-Are you waiting for somebody?
-Nope.

526
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,205
What are you doing here?

527
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,499
-Did you lose yourjob?
-No.

528
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,209
Did you?

529
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,794
You look good.

530
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:19,421
How's Megan?

531
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:20,881
She's good.

532
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,218
You're kind of new at that job
to be avoiding the office.

533
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,679
Just knocking out the cobwebs.

534
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,223
Someone told me this works.

535
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,310
So it's going well?

536
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,187
Yeah.

537
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,189
ls that okay?

538
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,901
That's what happens
when you help someone,

539
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,987
they succeed and move on.

540
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,408
Don't you want them to?

541
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,284
l'm proud of you.

542
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,205
l just didn't know it would be without me.

543
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,916
Well, put me on your call list.

544
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,876
What are you working on?

545
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,212
We're trying to get that women's cigarette
you were after.

546
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:02,715
God, l miss that easy money.

547
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,093
lt's easy to have. lt's not easy to win.

548
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:08,554
You'll beat it.

549
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,684
Well, l'm going to Virginia
to tour the factory.

550
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,811
l'm going on a plane.

551
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,897
-Richmond's nice.
-lt's not Paris.

552
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,483
And l'm going with Frank Gleason.

553
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,197
-Will you give my love to Megan?
-Sure.

554
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,367
We should all get together.

555
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:31,910
Yes.

556
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:40,753
Howdy, partner!

557
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,798
What do you say we get off in Harrison,

558
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,342
get back on the train
and go get into some trouble?

559
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,636
-What?
-l'm on my own.

560
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,765
You can say you fell asleep. You did.

561
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,143
You are the most disgusting person
l have ever seen.

562
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,436
Come on!

563
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,689
How could you do that to that woman?

564
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:04,193
You just couldn't wait to get her
in the hospital and erase her brain.

565
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,363
lt's you?

566
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:12,034
She always spreads her legs
for the first chump she can find.

567
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,330
What you doing?

568
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,539
Break it up!

569
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,087
-Knock it off!
-Gentlemen, calm down!

570
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,464
You okay, buddy?

571
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,633
You, Max Schmeling, you go that way.

572
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,134
-He started it.
-Out!

573
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:32,096
-My things are in the bar.
-That's not a surprise.

574
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,974
You're a real prick, you know that?

575
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,061
Listen, buddy, you're gonna
give it a couple of minutes,

576
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,521
you're gonna go down there and apologize.

577
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:41,980
To him?

578
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,107
Never.

579
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,484
You gotta ride the train every day
and he's a fellow commuter.

580
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,777
And l don't like fighting on my train.

581
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,028
lt's your train.

582
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:52,324
Are you paying to ride on it?
We're paying you to ride on it.

583
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,285
You work for us, so why don't you
go down there and apologize to him?

584
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,497
-l'm about to throw you off.
-Go ahead, you fat piece of crap.

585
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,166
l am an officer of the New Haven line.

586
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:04,336
Well, l'm president
of the Howdy Doody circus army.

587
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,880
-That's it, come on. You're coming...
-Get your hands off me!

588
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,137
You can't do that!

589
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,181
Get off the train. Harrison!

590
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,517
Next stop, Harrison.

591
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,524
What on earth happened?
Were you in another car accident?

592
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,734
The car's fine. There's not a scratch on it.

593
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:30,320
l'm not worried about the car.

594
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,489
My goodness, look at you.

595
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,534
l fell asleep and ran into a ditch.

596
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,119
Come with me.

597
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,751
l can't live like this.

598
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,130
Knowing you're out there working so hard

599
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,716
and then wondering if you're going to
come home and in what condition.

600
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,218
l'll come home.

601
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,598
l think you were right.

602
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,725
And first thing tomorrow morning,

603
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,394
we're going to find you
an apartment in the city.

604
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:44,496
l think this is where the staircase goes.

605
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:51,628
l'm going to have
the same view as you, Don.

606
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:54,339
Congratulations.

607
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,642
There she is. There's our Beauty.

608
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:07,894
Nice to see you again.

609
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:09,938
You look perfect.

610
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,483
-When do we start?
-When they're ready.

611
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:20,032
l can't believe this is happening.

612
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,200
Miss Calvet, would you step in, please?

613
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,371
You know l love you.

614
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:33,045
Rehearsal in five.

615
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:14,086
Give me an Old Fashioned.

616
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,938
Excuse me, do you have a light?

617
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:23,989
Thank you.

618
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,909
l'm sorry, but my friend down there,

619
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,372
she was wondering.

620
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,500
Are you alone?
