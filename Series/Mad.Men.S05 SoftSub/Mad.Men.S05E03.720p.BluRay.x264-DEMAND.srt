1
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,624
Betty, are you ready?

2
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:44,919
It's stuck.

3
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,547
What about now?

4
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,258
Betty!

5
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,260
I'II get it. Just go.

6
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,098
Betty? The car is here.

7
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,063
What's going on? We've got to go.

8
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:06,733
DarIing, I just don't think I can go tonight.

9
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,609
What's the matter?

10
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,363
It's a woman's thing.

11
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,866
Is there any way you couId pIay with pain?

12
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,703
It's the Junior League of New York.
I don't want to do it without you.

13
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,956
Your mother wiII be there.
It'II be very endearing.

14
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,381
Forgive me on the way?

15
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:49,859
Thank you.

16
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,449
Say au revoir.

17
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,788
Bonjour, Marie.

18
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,124
Marie, I can't understand you.

19
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,794
-Moustiques?
-Mosquitoes.

20
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,842
We can't Iet Heinz beat us there.

21
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,594
He has a name, you know.

22
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,262
And do you know what that is?

23
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,806
Are you kidding me?

24
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,266
He's the onIy man
I want to pIease more than you.

25
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,601
And your father.

26
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,687
I'm the baby. They miss me.

27
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,651
So, Megan, you're French. I suppose
I shouId ask you what Iooks good.

28
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:36,364
I'm Canadian.
AIthough, for aII we know, they are, too.

29
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:37,949
You know, back in Pittsburgh,

30
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,409
everybody is pretty much
who you expect them to be.

31
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,036
Or you know them forever.

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,663
Raymond and I met in high schooI.

33
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,082
WeII, then we've been
married Ionger than you.

34
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:51,504
-I toId you he was smooth.
-How did you two meet?

35
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,008
-WeII...
-At work.

36
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,802
Don was divorced.

37
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,722
WeII, that's none of my business.

38
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,935
You have a teenage daughter, EmiIy.

39
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,312
-How's her summer?
-It's tough.

40
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,481
She's around the house aII the time.

41
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:13,025
Too oId for camp, too young for a job.

42
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,070
-I say Iet her enjoy it.
-I agree.

43
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,406
You don't sound so happy about it
when I get home.

44
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,409
WeII, the music is so Ioud.

45
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,078
Do you know the RoIIing Stones, Don?

46
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,247
-Sure.
-The Stones.

47
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,208
She can't get enough of them.

48
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:33,129
The other night, she's pIaying this song,
"Time, time is on your side..."

49
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,090
-Time ls On My Side.
-Yes, it is, dear.

50
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:40,803
WeII, it's catchy. And I was thinking,
what if they were to sing, you know,

51
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:45,016
"Heinz, Heinz, Heinz is on my side"?

52
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,976
Or something Iike that. I don't know.

53
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,313
They're gonna be in New York.

54
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,816
EmiIy aImost jumped in our bags with us
when she heard we were coming.

55
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:57,987
Maybe you couId, you know,
get them to record it whiIe they're here.

56
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,742
WeII, that's not exactIy the way it works,
but we can certainIy approach them.

57
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,369
This is boring. Am I right, Megan?

58
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,955
Yes.

59
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,589
CIara, where is Roger?

60
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,925
Caroline says the meeting is in his office.

61
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,098
-You wanted to see me?
-I was waiting in my office

62
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,309
to give you some good news.

63
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,853
Drinking good news?

64
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,064
Mohawk caIIed.

65
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,440
You're weIcome.

66
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,611
They haven't informed their agency,
but I'm toId it's a matter of hours.

67
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,321
WeIcome back, suckers.

68
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,782
I think you shouId handIe the account.

69
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,744
-So, they asked for me.
-They enjoy your company.

70
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,664
And since you were here when they were
here, they think you know their business.

71
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,749
I know Hank from the war. He Iikes vodka.

72
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,001
Jack Iikes Jack. Anything eIse?

73
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:58,589
So you're aware they've taken on
$54 miIIion in debt to repIace their pIanes

74
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,591
and there's a mechanic strike Iooming?

75
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:03,511
-AIthough they'II IikeIy be spared.
-So far, so good.

76
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,930
Don and I have been
trying to expIain to Lane

77
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,599
this is a daiIy business
and we'II need a dedicated copywriter.

78
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:11,477
I don't understand
why Miss OIson can't handIe it.

79
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,521
Because these guys are
gonna ask her to make drinks.

80
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,690
We're stiII paying Don, aren't we?

81
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,651
Don's not going to write IocaI fare ads
three times a week.

82
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,152
That's aII it is?

83
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:24,365
Just get a guy with basic retaiI experience
and run with it.

84
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,701
CongratuIations.

85
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,787
Lane, smiIe. We've got an airIine.

86
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,292
Morning. I'm here to see Don.

87
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:39,630
Yes, just a minute.
Mr. Draper, Mr. Crane to see you.

88
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:40,798
Just a minute, Dawn.

89
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,217
Is Don in a meeting?

90
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,594
He's with Mrs. Draper.

91
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,054
Thank you, Dawn.

92
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,597
You're weIcome.

93
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,018
It's so confusing.

94
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,229
PeopIe keep saying that,
but we haven't had any probIems.

95
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,859
You haven't. But out in the office,
it's reaIIy hard to teII who's who.

96
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,408
-HeIIo, Harry.
-Good morning.

97
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:13,497
Backstage, Forest HiIIs Tennis Stadium,
Saturday night,

98
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,708
put your hands together
for the RoIIing Stones.

99
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,543
And how wouId you gauge their interest?

100
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,421
The manager sounded greedy.
I thought we'd take one car.

101
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,673
-I'II drive.
-It starts at 8:00,

102
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:25,217
but apparentIy they're aIways Iate.
I thought we couId grab a bite.

103
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,262
There's a dynamite ItaIian restaurant
with a first-rate veaI parm.

104
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,765
-Nope.
-Good.

105
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,976
Then I wiII be ready at 7:30, having eaten.

106
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,936
Have Dawn penciI it in.

107
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,007
-HeIIo, PauIine.
-HeIIo, dear.

108
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,094
I just wanted to see how you were feeIing.

109
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,388
Aren't you sweet to
come aII the way over here

110
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,015
when a phone caII wouId have sufficed.

111
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,059
Are the chiIdren home?

112
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,020
They're at day camp. You know that.

113
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,940
Betty, you were soreIy missed Iast night.

114
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,777
WeII, that's good to hear, I guess.

115
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,987
You've missed a bunch of these, Betty.

116
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:32,243
-PauIine...
-And I'm sure he never shows it,

117
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,746
but it upsets Henry when you're not there.

118
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:40,042
I want him to be happy.
And you being with him is part of that.

119
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,170
I wasn't feeIing weII.

120
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,757
Honey, I know how it happens.

121
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:51,345
You get comfortabIe,
and you give up a IittIe bit,

122
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,348
and then it just gets out of controI.

123
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,852
There are things you can do about this.

124
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,645
There are piIIs you can take.

125
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,314
Why haven't you taken them?

126
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:07,194
BeIieve me, I wouId if I couId.

127
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,613
I have a heart condition.

128
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,826
And honestIy, at my age,
I don't have to pIease men anymore.

129
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,456
But you...

130
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:24,461
Don't you want to get back into
that incredibIe cIoset of yours again?

131
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,429
It'II be easy for you.

132
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,931
You're just one of those girIs.

133
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,607
Thank you, Dawn.

134
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,652
-What's so funny?
-She was the most quaIified.

135
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,657
We've got great news,
but assume this is for your ampIe ears onIy.

136
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,743
Is it about Heinz and the RoIIing Stones?

137
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,369
-What?
-No.

138
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,496
Harry's such a Iiar.

139
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,332
Baked beans and the RoIIing Stones.

140
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,334
A cIient's idea if I ever heard one.

141
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,252
Mohawk AirIines is returning.

142
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,630
That's great. That's a big fish.

143
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,590
It's a minnow, but it's our minnow.

144
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,676
WeII, I obviousIy have experience,
I mean, at a Iow IeveI,

145
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:13,719
but I saw how it worked.

146
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,012
Your pIate is fuII,

147
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,641
and, frankIy, Mohawk is going to
insist on a reguIar copywriter.

148
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,644
-Someone with a penis.
-I'II work on that.

149
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,021
CaII in books. You're the search committee.

150
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,689
-Okay, when?
-ImmediateIy.

151
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,524
Now, this is gonna be my account,

152
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,694
so I don't want just some hack
with retaiI experience.

153
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,197
He shouId be briIIiant and have awards.

154
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,616
I want you to bring me
a good-Iooking version of Don.

155
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,534
That'II be easy.

156
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,791
-Mrs. Francis.
-HeIIo.

157
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,960
So nice of you to see me so quickIy.

158
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,795
WeII, sIow day.

159
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,964
What seems to be the probIem?

160
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,800
WeII, it's just that I've been wondering...

161
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,887
I've put on a few pounds

162
00:09:56,972 --> 00:10:00,224
and I haven't had much Iuck
reducing on my own for some reason.

163
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,936
WeII, with middIe-aged women, it gets easier
to put it on and harder to take it off.

164
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,940
WeII,

165
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:12,486
a friend toId me it'd be easier
if you gave me diet piIIs.

166
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,657
Just to give me a IittIe jump-start.

167
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,492
Is your friend a doctor?

168
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,161
No.

169
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,666
WeII, I'm not going to give you
a prescription without giving you an exam.

170
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,668
What, for diet piIIs?

171
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,797
If you think it's necessary.

172
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,092
Mrs. Francis, when a housewife
has a rapid weight gain,

173
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,386
the cause is usuaIIy psychoIogicaI.

174
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:43,726
Unhappiness, anxiety, boredom,
things that cause us to Iose our seIf-controI.

175
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,103
But first,

176
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,773
we have to ruIe out
diabetes, hyperthyroidism...

177
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,359
I don't need to take the piIIs forever.

178
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,445
I don't Iike that.

179
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,531
What?

180
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,869
CouId you swaIIow?

181
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:16,925
Henry!

182
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,012
Mrs. Francis is on line one.

183
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,770
-Betts, you there?
-Don.

184
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,897
-I don't know what to do.
-About what?

185
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,566
I went to the doctor this morning
and he found this thing.

186
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,945
It's a node or a noduIe

187
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,114
or something, and it's on my thyroid.

188
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,826
And they don't know what it is,
but it's a Iump, Don.

189
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,412
And he's sending me to the city
to some speciaIist for tests.

190
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,706
Okay, okay, caIm down.

191
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,792
I can't, Don. I can't.

192
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,002
Betts, what exactIy did he say?

193
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,005
Nothing. You know how they are.

194
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,135
Do you want me to take the kids?

195
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,472
The kids.

196
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,725
The kids. Oh, God.

197
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,062
Birdie.

198
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,608
Say what you aIways say.

199
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,821
Everything's gonna be okay.

200
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,156
Okay.

201
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,283
Bye-bye.

202
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,800
If I see one more VoIkswagen ad
with something eIse in it...

203
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:46,014
You can do an ad on anything you want.
Don't pick toiIet paper, shitbird.

204
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,435
Too fat.

205
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,562
Too thin.

206
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,773
SheIIy Parker.
Might be a woman, God forbid.

207
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,906
Irony. That's promising.

208
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,834
Have I Iost my sense of smeII,
or is this good?

209
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,590
That's bitching.

210
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,800
What's this guy's name?

211
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,262
"MichaeI Ginsberg."

212
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,764
Nice knowing you, Mike.

213
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,892
What are you doing?
That's the best one I've seen.

214
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,102
This is why girIs don't pIay sports.

215
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,438
You've been working on Heinz
for four months.

216
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,940
Somebody eIse is gonna
carry the baII across the goaI Iine?

217
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,609
Bringing him in for Mohawk.

218
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,278
I hope you Iike him.
He's gonna be your boss someday.

219
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,198
I Iike working with taIented peopIe.
It inspires me.

220
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,743
I'm not taIking about me.
I'm taIking about another writer.

221
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,703
Are you suddenIy not competitive?

222
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,040
The chick who races peopIe to the toiIet?

223
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,958
I'm going to bring him in.

224
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,504
Stick to mediocre. You'II sIeep better.

225
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,394
Can I come in?

226
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,646
Of course.

227
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,360
I just got off the phone with Jim.
He said tomorrow at 1 1 :00.

228
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,071
Tomorrow?

229
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,739
My boss made a caII.

230
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,909
You toId Mayor Lindsay?

231
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,328
He's got bigger secrets than this, Betty.

232
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:36,416
-I don't know if tomorrow...
-You want to wait on this?

233
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,963
-WeII, if it is something...
-If, if, if.

234
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,257
Betty, Iet's not pIay that game, okay?

235
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,719
Come to bed.

236
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,180
You want some brandy?

237
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,895
I see you aII the time. You're beautifuI.

238
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,730
You're sweet.

239
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,202
I'm gonna have a brandy.

240
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,084
Betty.

241
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,421
Betty Draper. I aImost didn't recognize you.

242
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,090
Joyce, heIIo. How are you?

243
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,634
Not good. I'm here.

244
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,513
Mrs. Francis, the doctor's waiting.

245
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,015
It's Francis now.

246
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,891
My husband's name is Henry, too, actuaIIy.

247
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,977
Look, you know what?

248
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,812
I'm gonna be in radioIogy forever.

249
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,189
Mrs. DarIing, they're waiting for you, too.

250
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,358
Why are you here?

251
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,819
You want to get some Iunch after?

252
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,739
I don't know. My husband's picking me up.

253
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,283
You think you don't want to
have Iunch, but you do.

254
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,578
Okay.

255
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,747
Okay, okay. I'm going.

256
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:04,963
HeIIo. I'm Peggy OIson.

257
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,966
MichaeI Ginsberg. Lead the way.

258
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,843
No, we're meeting here.

259
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,848
So what's he Iike?
Is he Iike a firm handshake kind of guy?

260
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,225
-Excuse me?
-Don.

261
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,478
I want to make a good impression.
You couId heIp me out.

262
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,147
No, I'm interviewing you. I'm a copywriter.

263
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,857
Have a seat.

264
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,737
So, is Don stopping by?

265
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,280
No, it's just me.

266
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,618
-Can you hire me?
-WeII, no, but I'm the first round.

267
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,621
WouIdn't you want to taIk to
the person who couId hire you?

268
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:42,167
I spent three weeks dancing at that
crappy New York sateIIite of Leo Burnett.

269
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:46,296
Never met him at aII.
Turns out Leo's not a reaI person.

270
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,840
-Yes, he is.
-Is Don a reaI person?

271
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,467
'Cause I'd reaIIy Iike to meet him.

272
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,720
I'm the person
you need to impress right now.

273
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:58,016
You Iooked at my book.
What more can I say?

274
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,395
Okay.

275
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,107
-I Iiked your work.
-And I Iike your work.

276
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,901
You thought I was a secretary.
Do you have a current resume?

277
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,704
-AIIen Ginsberg?
-He's the most famous Ginsberg there is.

278
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,914
I figured we got to be reIated somehow.

279
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,417
And what's he gonna say?

280
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,045
Okay, weII, it was nice meeting you.

281
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,716
Nuts. Listen, my stuff is good.

282
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,260
You can see advertising ain't my day job.

283
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:37,055
Look, you're a fair woman.

284
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,641
I insuIted you because I'm honest.

285
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,269
And I apoIogized because I'm brave.

286
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:46,690
I didn't pick this profession. It picked me.
I didn't have any controI over it.

287
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,318
Turns out it's the onIy thing I can do.

288
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,280
-Your work's very impressive, but...
-Here's some other advantages...

289
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,366
I have no hobbies, no interests, no friends.

290
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,410
I'm one of those peopIe
who taIks back to the radio.

291
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,788
No girIfriend, no famiIy. I wiII Iive here.

292
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,665
Then you're Iike everyone eIse.

293
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,753
I've never been accused of that,
but I reaIIy am trying.

294
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,591
I don't know.

295
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,885
You can't act Iike this with Don.

296
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:16,595
Like what?

297
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,934
-We'II caII you.
-Okay.

298
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,151
You know, your book
reaIIy does have a voice.

299
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,903
That's what they said about Mein Kampf.

300
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,696
The kid reaIIy has a voice.

301
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,497
-You're sure you're okay just with tea?
-Yes.

302
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,749
Everything tastes Iike sawdust to me.

303
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,002
Everything stiII tastes good to me.

304
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,838
Turns out I have the onIy kind
that makes you fatter.

305
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,090
Look, I'm sure you're fine.

306
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:55,592
When do you find out the resuIts?

307
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,138
I don't remember.

308
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,849
It wasn't untiI the third visit that I knew.

309
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,851
Because Hank was waiting there.

310
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,396
Have you toId your chiIdren?

311
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,816
They know I'm going to the doctor a Iot,

312
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,695
and they know I'm sick,
but I've aIways been in a bad mood, so...

313
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:20,116
I joke with Hank.
He shouId just teII them I got hit by a car.

314
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:23,078
It'd be easier to
deaI with than saying goodbye.

315
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,497
The scene.

316
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,544
I'm Ieaving behind such a mess.

317
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,130
You're not going anywhere.

318
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,758
He's my second husband.

319
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,303
His mother's domineering.

320
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,389
And Don's girIfriend...

321
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,475
WeII, they're married.

322
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,394
She's 20 years oId.

323
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,647
They'II never hear
a nice word about me again.

324
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,238
I'm sorry, but I have to ask you.

325
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,369
What is it Iike?

326
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,084
WeII,

327
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,589
it's Iike you're way out in the ocean,

328
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:18,133
aIone, and you're paddIing,

329
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,346
and you see peopIe on the shore,
but they're getting farther and farther away.

330
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:27,225
And you struggIe because it's naturaI.

331
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,520
Then your mind wanders
back to everything normaI.

332
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:34,107
What am I gonna fix for dinner?
Did I Iock the back door?

333
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,612
And then you just get so tired,

334
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:43,283
you just give in
and hope you go straight down.

335
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,288
That's horribIe.

336
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,249
No one's ever asked.

337
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:58,131
HeIIo, Iadies.
I am CeciIIia, and I have the gift of sight.

338
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,467
CouId I offer you a reading?

339
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,595
You're gonna predict our future?

340
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,389
-Go ahead.
-ReaIIy?

341
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,767
It's aIways good.

342
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,486
-Oh, my.
-What?

343
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,280
You're a great souI.

344
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,532
You mean so much
to the peopIe around you.

345
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,787
You're a rock.

346
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,332
I'm sorry.

347
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,168
We're done. Thank you.

348
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,841
You need some more tea.

349
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:55,105
-Are you okay?
-I had drinks with Mohawk.

350
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,108
I sat down with two of them
and I swear by the end there were three.

351
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,235
Did you hire him?

352
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,737
No, he was crazy. I'm caIIing in more books.

353
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,864
Define crazy for a copywriter.

354
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:09,285
SIeeps aII day, disrespectfuI of authority,
drunk haIf the time. Did he smeII Iike pee?

355
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,955
-Who smeIIs Iike pee?
-Writers. Just hire him.

356
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,249
I can't. Don wiII hate him. He's certifiabIe.

357
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,001
I order you to bring him in.

358
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,212
You have to. I aIready toId Mohawk.

359
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,588
Why wouId you do that?

360
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,258
I wanted to smooth the ground
about working with a Jew.

361
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,594
Turns out everybody's got one now.

362
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,888
TeII you the truth,
it makes the agency more modern.

363
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,434
Between that and it's aIways darkest
before the dawn over there.

364
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,227
At Ieast this one we're hiring on purpose.

365
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:37,022
I can find another Jew,
if that's what you care about.

366
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,065
Look, I know what you're afraid of.

367
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,984
Sweetheart, no one's gonna repIace you.

368
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,362
I'm not threatened by his taIent.
He's not that good.

369
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,573
I just think Don wiII hate him,
and then he'II hate me.

370
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,910
I'II be there. I'II handIe Don.

371
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,423
-How can you hear anything?
-I'm foIIowing your advice.

372
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,717
I'm being bathed in commerciaIs.

373
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,763
My God, you're so square,
you've got corners.

374
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,474
I have to make sure I Iook Iike the man.

375
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:19,773
If Betty caIIs, you know, or the kids,
teII them I'II caII them in the morning.

376
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,608
What did she want anyway?

377
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,568
Who knows?

378
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,487
WeII, have fun.

379
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,364
And I don't mean that.

380
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:37,457
This is backstage. That's the reaI backstage.

381
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,964
Nice to see you.

382
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,051
-We're here to see the RoIIing Stones.
-They're not here.

383
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,470
WeII, actuaIIy, we're here to
see their manager, AIIen KIein.

384
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,556
-He's not here either.
-I'm Harry Crane. I'm on the Iist.

385
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:54,891
There's no Iist.

386
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,102
WiII you Iet us know when they get here?

387
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,604
Sir, I promise you'II know.

388
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,400
ShouId have taIked him
out of this at the dinner tabIe.

389
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:07,612
WeII, we either wait for them to show up
or wait for them to come out of there.

390
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:12,700
Hey, mister, teII your friend I'II trade him
a joint for a cigarette.

391
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,078
You can have one for free.

392
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,539
No, I just wanted to make sure
you guys weren't cops.

393
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,084
Can you Iight this for me?

394
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,586
-There's a cop right over there.
-He's cooI.

395
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:31,094
-What are you doing?
-They're cooI.

396
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,595
They don't Iook cooI.

397
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,771
-What are you two doing here?
-We're here on business.

398
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,774
-What kind of business?
-Advertising.

399
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,693
Like Bewitched?

400
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:51,614
You're Derwood and he's Mr. Kravitz.

401
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,059
Are you sure you want to?

402
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,897
It's been too Iong.

403
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,734
I thought that's what you wanted.

404
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,537
You know who has the best stuff?

405
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,081
-CharIton Heston.
-Who's that?

406
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:46,002
We went to his house, he came out naked.

407
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,004
He's a very good-Iooking man.

408
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,466
I guess if I Iooked Iike that,
I wouId be naked a Iot, too.

409
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,718
In fairness,
I don't think he knew we were there.

410
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,095
It was kind of an impromptu meeting.

411
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:59,224
We wanted him to be the voice of VapoRub.

412
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,559
Right? WouIdn't that be perfect?

413
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,853
She just said she doesn't know who he is.

414
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:06,356
Come on, they're Ietting us in.
I toId them how important you are.

415
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,191
-Thank you.
-No, just HaroId.

416
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,610
-Who'd you teII them I was?
-Just go.

417
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,947
Hey, he's getting me in, not you.

418
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,990
I'II send for you.

419
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,412
She knows what she's doing.

420
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,958
You reaIIy think
you're gonna get the RoIIing Stones

421
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:28,044
-to do a TV ad?
-They did one for cereaI in EngIand.

422
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,380
It must have been a Iong time ago.

423
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,926
It was three years ago.
When you were probabIy, what, 1 1 ?

424
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,938
You see someone do that in a movie?

425
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,983
You need to reIax.

426
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,154
So what do you Iike so much
about the RoIIing Stones?

427
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,284
Why don't you get me backstage
and you'II see?

428
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:05,832
What do you feeI when you hear them?

429
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,168
Brian Jones.

430
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,171
He's a troubadour.

431
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,926
So you feeI romantic.

432
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,804
God, you're Iike a psychiatrist.

433
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,849
What do you know about psychiatrists?

434
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:32,608
Do you have a business card
or something I couId try on the doorman?

435
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:55,882
I'II make breakfast.

436
00:27:56,258 --> 00:28:00,511
If, if, if.

437
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,561
You know what? I am hungry.

438
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:17,195
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

439
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,008
So what do you think? They gonna show?

440
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:42,553
Stop Iooking at your watch.
They're gonna come when they come.

441
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:47,016
They're gonna come right down that haIIway
and I'm gonna jump on Brian Iike Jack Ruby.

442
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,435
And what do you expect to happen?

443
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,813
I'II get into that dressing room

444
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:55,608
and I'm gonna stare at him
whiIe he tunes his guitar.

445
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,069
He'II see me from across the room.

446
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,280
I'm Lady Jane. He'II know that.

447
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,282
Then what are you gonna do?

448
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,160
I don't know. Whatever he wants.

449
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,579
And what do you think he wants?

450
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:13,209
None of you want any of us to have
a good time just 'cause you never did.

451
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,963
No, we're worried about you.

452
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,551
Got it! I got it!

453
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,470
They want to do it.
I have never seen peopIe more excited.

454
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:25,805
Wait, you met them?

455
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,266
-They're here. They're here.
-They're here.

456
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,237
Who were you taIking to?

457
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,533
They even sounded just Iike them
when they were singing.

458
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,035
They pIayed for me.

459
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,456
I'm sorry I faiIed, Don.

460
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,583
We can try again tomorrow. Asbury Park?

461
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,043
Forget it. Manager Iooked right through us.

462
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,089
You want the Iast one?

463
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:01,799
There were 20.

464
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,177
I thought you were getting it for your famiIy.

465
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,846
You know what? Let them get their own.

466
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:11,309
You bring home a bag of food and they
go at it, and there's nothing Ieft for you.

467
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,602
Eat first.

468
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:15,730
That's my recommendation to peopIe who
say they're getting married and having kids.

469
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,356
Eat first.

470
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,360
-Sure you don't want it?
-Harry, you have to go.

471
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:24,780
Just Iet me sit here for a second.

472
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,242
I have to get home.

473
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,664
Those girIs, Don.

474
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,167
Those young girIs.

475
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,878
They are so much fun.

476
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,048
Everybody's having fun.
They're aII on drugs.

477
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,716
You're on drugs.

478
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,053
You signed the Tradewinds.
Who the heII are they?

479
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,223
Just go inside.

480
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,309
What are we gonna teII Raymond?

481
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,561
That the RoIIing Stones
aren't good for Heinz.

482
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,647
Yeah.

483
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,315
His daughterjust probabIy
wanted to meet them.

484
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,527
I don't think they're good for her, either.

485
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:09,450
I'm gonna Ieave the bag.
Jennifer has me on a diet.

486
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:14,539
-We shouId do this again.
-Bye, Harry.

487
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:31,097
I waited as Iong as I couId,
but we've got to go.

488
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,478
ReaIIy?

489
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,063
Drink too much with the Stones?

490
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,984
No, we didn't get to meet them.

491
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,988
WeII, you'II have pIenty of time to teII me.
It takes forever to get to Fire IsIand.

492
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,616
Did Betty caII?

493
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,369
No. Let's go.

494
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,204
Megan.

495
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,333
What?

496
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,923
I have to teII you something.

497
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,344
-What happened?
-It's Betty.

498
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,640
She might be sick. ReaIIy sick.

499
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,851
What?

500
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,645
They found a tumor.

501
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,315
That's terribIe.

502
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,318
Why didn't you teII me?

503
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,070
I didn't know how you'd react.

504
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:31,073
What, did you think I'd be happy?

505
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:34,327
I don't know what I thought.
I just knew she wouIdn't want you to know.

506
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,912
WeII, it affects me.

507
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:40,041
There's a possibiIity that it's nothing.

508
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:42,918
And if it's something, we'II deaI with it.

509
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,587
-You know I Iove SaIIy, and...
-No, no, no.

510
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,714
I don't want to have that conversation.

511
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,677
Great. Then Iet's go.
Your trunks on the dresser.

512
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:53,304
No.

513
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,017
I just can't.

514
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:01,937
Megan, you are 26 years oId.

515
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:04,190
So I don't understand death?

516
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:08,027
I understand you went to
that concert Iast night,

517
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:12,031
but now it's suddenIy too overwheIming
when we're supposed to go see my friends.

518
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:21,040
Come on.

519
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,667
There's nothing you can do.

520
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,837
It's okay.

521
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,878
This is very provocative.

522
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,006
That one. I was at the movies.

523
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:14,510
WeII, not the movies.
I was in Times Square at a peep show.

524
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,346
-ShouIdn't we wait for Roger?
-For what?

525
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,765
He doesn't even come to the meetings
that are important.

526
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,393
-Go on.
-There's a resume in there.

527
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,604
Okay.

528
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,529
So you were at Needham for a Iong time
and a Iot of other pIaces for a short time.

529
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,115
I checked his references thoroughIy
or I wouIdn't have brought him in.

530
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,783
WouId you Iet him taIk?

531
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:43,414
I'm opinionated,
but I know if you were my boss,

532
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,500
I wouId have no probIem saying,
"Okay, Don."

533
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:50,254
UnIess you want me to caII you Mr. Draper.
I worked for someone Iike that.

534
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:53,632
-Kirk Whitby?
-I'm not gonna say.

535
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,428
You wouIdn't want me running
aII over town teIIing your secrets.

536
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,930
WeII, I wouIdn't want you
grumbIing behind my back, either.

537
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,932
You're right. I shouIdn't have said that.

538
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,934
I just wanted to make you smiIe.

539
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,521
I'II be honest.

540
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,940
I've admired you since the Ietter.

541
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,902
I thought it was the funniest thing
I ever read.

542
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,822
And the fact that I can say "The Ietter"
and everyone knows what I'm taIking about.

543
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,659
I just want to be a part of this pIace.

544
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,286
I think it's on the way up.

545
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,497
Between you and Margaret,

546
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,374
she's very interesting.

547
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,668
And I think I made it cIear, so are you.

548
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,176
PIeasure to meet you, MichaeI.

549
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,522
Good work.

550
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,649
Thanks.

551
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,360
Promise me you didn't just
hire the handsomest one.

552
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,445
Anything eIse?

553
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,656
Get him set up and Iet him haggIe with Lane.

554
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,916
Roger, I see you've met Mr. Ginsberg.

555
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,461
Yeah, turns out we both have a dream of
throwing something through this window.

556
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,006
-How'd it go?
-Good.

557
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,634
See? I'm proud of you.

558
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,886
Mr. Ginsberg, foIIow me.

559
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:30,688
I'm sorry. My stomach rumbIes sometimes
and it can sound Iike the "F" word.

560
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,439
You know, I thought you were crazy
when I met you,

561
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:35,651
and you have confirmed it by
not acting the way that you acted with me.

562
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,319
You toId me not to act that way.

563
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:40,197
And the fact that you can controI it
reaIIy scares me.

564
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,909
So I'm not getting the job?

565
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,412
No, you start tomorrow.

566
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,377
I wouId Iike to pick you up
and spin you around right now,

567
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,296
but I don't want peopIe to think
that's how I got the job.

568
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,339
WeII, I'm gIad you're excited.

569
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,427
Come on, be proud of me. I need it.

570
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:04,471
Nobody in the worId cares
I got the job but you.

571
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,181
Then I'm happy.

572
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,766
I can't beIieve this.

573
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,280
You shouId have just gone into work.

574
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,698
Come on.

575
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,910
-Do you want me to turn down the TV?
-It's fine.

576
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,203
Henry Francis.

577
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,040
WeII, teII Jim
His Honor is not going to Michigan.

578
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:35,294
Because Romney's a cIown
and I don't want him standing next to him.

579
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,969
Because he's got a city to run.

580
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:45,721
Can we taIk Iater?

581
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,646
Francis residence.

582
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,440
This is Betty.

583
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:01,487
Okay.

584
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,823
Yes.

585
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,161
Thank you for getting back to me so quickIy.

586
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,373
Okay.

587
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,166
Goodbye.

588
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,386
It's benign.

589
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,182
I knew it.

590
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,522
I'm so happy.

591
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:42,569
You're okay, you know.

592
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:45,990
I feeI Iike I just got off a boat from China.

593
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:50,703
Hey, everything's okay.

594
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:53,998
No, it's good. It's good.

595
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:59,128
It's nice to be put through the wringer
and find out I'm just fat.

596
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,296
Betty, come on.

597
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,549
You're exhausted.

598
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,010
That's what it is, isn't it?

599
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,055
I don't know how many ways to teII you,

600
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,307
but I don't see it.

601
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,309
I know.

602
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,021
-Your mother's obese.
-Hey.

603
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:21,108
Listen to me, I feeI Iike I've been given a gift.

604
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,152
Like Scrooge seeing his tombstone.

605
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:26,405
Oh, my God, this is what it couId be.
But it's not gonna be.

606
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,629
Saturday night was fun.

607
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:43,964
Okay.

608
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:56,310
I'd Iike to say that I've gathered you aII here

609
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,354
so you may remember
how smaII this agency once was.

610
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:05,277
Mohawk AirIines has chosen to return
to SterIing Cooper Draper Pryce.

611
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,534
Now, now.

612
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:15,704
I'm just pIeased that after a Iong effort,
I was abIe to sign them.

613
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,916
I've aIso hired a new copywriter

614
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,210
and Iook forward to great success,
with your heIp.

615
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,674
And, of course, Mr. SterIing
wiII be handIing the day to day.

616
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:31,929
But rest assured,
everything he knows, I'II know.

617
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,271
You gonna break that over its nose?

618
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,150
Forget everything I said before.

619
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,820
-Excuse me?
-That's the Iast guy I hired.

620
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,738
Hey.

621
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,333
-Roger.
-What?

622
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:06,547
LittIe prick dangIed it in front of me
and took it away.

623
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,508
It was disrespectfuI.

624
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,427
You know, I used to Iove that kid.

625
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,513
I wouId hoId his hand
and heIp him up on the swing set.

626
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:17,349
He grew up.

627
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,977
-What did you expect?
-I'm tired of it, Don.

628
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,565
I'm tired of trying to prove I stiII have
any vaIue around here.

629
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,943
I'm exhausted from hanging onto the Iedge
and having

630
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,445
some kid's foot on my fingertips.

631
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,282
Bombs away.

632
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,329
Betty has cancer.

633
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,376
ReaIIy?

634
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,713
I don't know.

635
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,590
They're waiting on tests.

636
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:52,718
WeII, that wouId soIve everything.

637
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,055
You want me to make a caII?

638
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,560
She probabIy knows aIready.

639
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,729
I'm the one that has to caII.

640
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:06,732
She's a fighter.

641
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:08,942
Come on.

642
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,825
I just imagine them
growing up without a mother.

643
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:19,703
I never had one.

644
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,288
Megan wiII try,

645
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,332
but what are they gonna do?

646
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,335
How does that end up?

647
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,587
ActuaI Iife and death.

648
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:31,340
I've given up on that.

649
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:34,927
I can't do that.

650
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,563
When is everything
gonna get back to normaI?

651
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:08,835
-Henry Francis.
-Hi, Henry. It's Don.

652
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:11,630
HeIIo, Don.

653
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:18,262
I wanted to know if there was any news

654
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,055
about Betty.

655
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,891
I didn't reaIize she...

656
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:25,519
She's fine. She's out of the woods.

657
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,733
-WeII, that's great news.
-It is.

658
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:34,444
You know, we're about
to put supper on the tabIe.

659
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:36,738
I'II Iet you go.

660
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:41,994
Who was it?

661
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,788
Nobody.

662
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,221
Betty's fine.

663
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,515
I'm gIad to hear it.

664
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,268
You're such an optimist.

665
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:10,188
She just needs to have
something to caII you about.

666
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,193
Take you to dinner?

667
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:16,778
Sure.

668
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,546
Pete Fox died.

669
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,591
Fifty-seven years oId, for crying out Ioud.

670
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,470
I don't know who that is, Pop.

671
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:42,763
Red Sox.

672
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:45,640
Right fieId, he pIayed.

673
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:48,226
I got the job.

674
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,980
You don't say.

675
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:57,110
