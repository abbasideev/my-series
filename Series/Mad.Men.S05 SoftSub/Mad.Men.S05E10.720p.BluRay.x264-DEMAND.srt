1
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,338
-Hello?
-l apologize for the hour.

2
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:50,091
You instructed me to avoid your offices.

3
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,926
But we have good news.

4
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,430
Thank goodness.

5
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:59,058
The Hansard procedure negotiations
have concluded as promised.

6
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:02,812
You need only wire
the full £2,900 by Thursday

7
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,232
and your slate will be clear
with the lnland Revenue.

8
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,859
As promised?

9
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:11,154
Your promise was to extricate me
from this situation altogether.

10
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,364
My promise was to keep you out of prison.

11
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,825
Thursday.

12
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,953
How am l supposed to find
$8,000 in two days?

13
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,038
That's not possible. That's no help at all.

14
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:24,792
Look, Lane, you gave
Her Majesty's portion to a foreign power,

15
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:28,212
and the tax man is keen
to make an example of an expatriate.

16
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,924
This is the very best news there could be.

17
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,551
You should get a pencil.

18
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,970
l'll give you the information.

19
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,687
What are you doing out here?

20
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:47,064
Business. Get back to bed, dear.

21
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:50,151
-What are you looking for?
-Go back to bed this minute!

22
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,995
Scarlett, hold this and stand here.

23
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,206
No.

24
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,708
Mr. Kinsey called regarding lunch.

25
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,754
-What does he want?
-l think he wants to have lunch.

26
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,590
-What's wrong with him? He's very polite.
-Yeah.

27
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,842
You should have seen him
at Ken's bachelor party.

28
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,970
-l think he was on LSD.
-Really?

29
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:22,308
He's sort of been threatening to "spot" by.

30
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,227
Scarlett, here you are.

31
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,521
l'm sorry, Mr. Pryce. Do you need me?

32
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:30,107
Only in that l wanted you
to direct me to Mr. Crane.

33
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,567
Please leave us.

34
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,694
l'll meet him for coffee.

35
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,159
l was hoping we could discuss
the first quarter media projections.

36
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,369
Sure.

37
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,752
These numbers are very positive.

38
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,629
They're projections.

39
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,465
They're derived from reality,
but they're hopes and dreams.

40
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,008
January and February look great.

41
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,594
Heinz, Mohawk, Vicks, all pretty stable.

42
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,346
When will they become commitments?

43
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,806
l can't predict the future, Lane.

44
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,224
l don't know
what the Russians are going to do.

45
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,059
We may be living underground
by Lincoln's birthday.

46
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,523
That's my only copy.

47
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,282
Hope you don't need any actual paperwork
because everything's out by my desk

48
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,492
and my desk is out by Chuck.

49
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,786
How's Rebecca?

50
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:27,039
About the same, underfed and underpaid.

51
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,165
And Laura?

52
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,835
She calls me during the day
and she's peachy.

53
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,587
But l come home and she's blue.

54
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,590
-To the holidays.
-To gin.

55
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:40,261
So, Walt, what do you think
about extending our credit by $50,000?

56
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:45,057
l didn't know we were
going to talk real business.

57
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,602
Should l slow down?

58
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,565
How do things look for '67?

59
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,109
The projections suggest...

60
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,362
No projections.
We're only interested in commitments.

61
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,323
Yes, the commitments are firm,

62
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,950
but no one's been paying their bills on time.

63
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,786
l got it. Done.

64
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,707
Are you going away?

65
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,376
No. l love Christmas in Manhattan.

66
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:15,922
Can you take care of it today?
l'd like to start writing checks immediately.

67
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,423
Sure.

68
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,383
We're heading to Florida.

69
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,637
l want to fly, but l think we're going to drive.

70
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,279
-Roger, Cooper's office.
-Coming.

71
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,117
What's the hurry, Harry?

72
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,827
Are you drunk?

73
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,538
Pearl Harbor Day. Show some respect.

74
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,165
How are you doing with your bombing?

75
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,085
Remember Lane's fool at Jaguar,
Edwin Baker?

76
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,962
You mean Bazooka Joe?

77
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,882
Three weeks ago,
he was replaced by Hugh Hibbert,

78
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,342
and we are back in the running.

79
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,178
-He called you?
-No, l called him.

80
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,639
ln fact, l've been working
a few prospects over there for months,

81
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,766
waiting for Edwin to self-destruct,

82
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,226
and he did...

83
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,353
Spectacularly, apparently.

84
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,356
He vomited in the lap
of the head of the dealers association.

85
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,901
Who else?

86
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:23,114
lt sounds like Foote Cone,
Ted Bates, D'Arcy.

87
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,991
Everyone who doesn't have a car.

88
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,326
-What is that, nine of us?
-No, it's five.

89
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,828
And size-wise, we're the smallest,

90
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,122
so let's all start boning up
on the wonders of Jaguar.

91
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,456
We have a meet-and-greet next week

92
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,251
and the presentations
are sometime in mid-January.

93
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,711
That's a lot of work.

94
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,047
Yes. You may have to stay past 5:30.

95
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,426
l'd live here if l thought
it was more than a pipe dream.

96
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,266
We reject the material world

97
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,310
in favor of the recognition
of one's true identity.

98
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,646
l don't understand what you're saying.

99
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,189
Paul?

100
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,236
Harry Crane, as l live and breathe.

101
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,655
What the hell happened to you?

102
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,365
Krishna consciousness.

103
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,123
Don't pretend this isn't strange.

104
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,042
That's why l wanted you to see it.

105
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,669
Consider it seen. l really should be going.

106
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:21,756
Harry, l've been trying to get you down here.

107
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,177
Remember how anxious, how insecure,
how terrified l was of living life?

108
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,220
lt's gone.

109
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,347
Can you imagine living that way, Harry?

110
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,266
l'm sorry, this is giving me the willies.

111
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,310
Please, keep an open mind.

112
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,187
Can we do this for a few minutes?

113
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,980
Am l allowed to be here?

114
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,983
-Everyone's allowed to be here.
-Hello, there.

115
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,736
Harry, this is Mother Lakshmi.

116
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,946
Hare Krishna, Harry.

117
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,324
-l get it.
-Get what?

118
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,517
-l should go.
-No.

119
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:15,810
Chant with us.

120
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,188
You'll like it. l promise.

121
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:56,016
Roger's not coming.
He's on Battleship Row.

122
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,269
But l've already told him.

123
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,688
l called this meeting.

124
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,439
Where's Joan?

125
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,608
lt's best Joan's not here
for my announcement.

126
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,360
l don't know about yours.

127
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,157
-Go ahead.
-Very well.

128
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,869
A recent pass of the books
shows that we have

129
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:18,372
a surplus of $50,000,

130
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,918
and l believe that enables us
to distribute Christmas bonuses.

131
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:27,673
Equal shares to full partners,
half shares to juniors,

132
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,468
2% gifts to S.N.C. and 4% E.N.C.

133
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,762
God bless us, everyone.

134
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,558
And l shall see to it that
the checks are distributed immediately.

135
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,227
Actually, let's wait till the Christmas party.

136
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,356
Someone's not going to be happy,
and l'd rather not stare at her for a month.

137
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,442
Approved.

138
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,110
-Don...
-l have to announce

139
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,113
that we're in the running...
l mean, actually this time

140
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,239
for Jaguar.

141
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,160
So it's time we all get some learning
on this fine automobile.

142
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,495
l intend to drive the Mark ll this afternoon.

143
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,122
Don,

144
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:05,085
don't you think the bonuses would
make more of an impact now?

145
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,130
There's nothing like a surprise for morale.

146
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,548
Not my morale.

147
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,218
The Jaguar announcement
should be good for morale.

148
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,178
And, as much as it affects me personally,

149
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,180
l think we should sit tight on the bonuses.

150
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,350
Jaguar will provide only a little seed
and we'll have to supplement.

151
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,434
Damn it!

152
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,938
We can afford to do both.

153
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,774
-What ghost visited you, Ebenezer?
-Pete.

154
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,984
You asked me to stop this last time.

155
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,319
Yes, other than Roger,

156
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,697
who started drinking
at exactly 7:55 this morning,

157
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:37,201
no one has given me the reaction l desire

158
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,286
from this blessed event.

159
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:40,788
Bert.

160
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,624
They're lemons. They never start.

161
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,377
Meeting adjourned.

162
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,342
You like my shirt?

163
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,971
lt's very festive.

164
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,014
You know, it's sacrilege to say this,

165
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,309
but Pearl Harbor was an act of genius.

166
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,146
The only thing they didn't plan for
was success.

167
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,358
The Japs won
and they didn't know what to do with it.

168
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,318
Mr. Sterling,

169
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,405
seeing as you're dressed for fishing,

170
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,283
you'll have more success if you're quiet.

171
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,829
Don't be like that.

172
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,081
l couldn't care less.

173
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,000
l know why you're mad.

174
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,754
But Jane is not going to take everything.

175
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,840
lt never occurred to me.

176
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,591
Because the Army is
taking such good care of you?

177
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,719
-Have l asked?
-No.

178
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,055
And you shouldn't have to and you don't
and you keep sending it back.

179
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,557
Because it's a short-term solution.

180
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,893
-l told you, l'll cover Kevin through college.
-No.

181
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,895
lt's better this way for him.

182
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,357
And if you're not careful,
you won't even be a family friend.

183
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,152
-Joanie, l had an experience.
-l know, Roger.

184
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,945
lt's not about honor.

185
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,824
lt's about the fact that
we created a human life.

186
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,827
We made a baby.

187
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,704
Yes.

188
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,166
And now it's some other lucky girl's turn.

189
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,795
Scarlett.

190
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,841
Hello.

191
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:39,698
All of us have a very close connection.

192
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,700
Krishna.

193
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,078
My head is humming.

194
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,080
And your mind is clear.

195
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,332
Yeah.

196
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,000
l should be getting back.

197
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,044
Holy shit, how long have l been here?

198
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,756
-Are you hungry?
-l am.

199
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,384
Paramatma, take him for some food.

200
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,594
Yes, Mother Lakshmi.
That's a beautiful idea.

201
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,514
-Harry, will you eat with me?
-Just the two of us?

202
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,355
But when we are

203
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,483
in the material, conditional life,

204
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,985
we forget this.

205
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,492
lt is so good to see you.

206
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,703
lt's good to see you, too.

207
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,539
But l'm not gonna join.

208
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,332
l don't want you to.

209
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,293
But l can tell you really got into that.

210
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,754
l can tell you really got into Lakshmi.

211
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,048
l love her deeply, Harry.

212
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,884
Absolutely. She's my kind of religion.

213
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,594
lt's not like that.

214
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,972
Lakshmi lived most of her life
as a girl named Janet,

215
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:48,434
whose promiscuity
led her to drugs and prostitution.

216
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,269
The movement saved her life.

217
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,354
So what's your excuse?

218
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,442
l was at rock bottom.

219
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,944
l had really degraded myself.

220
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,988
-At McCann?
-No, damn it.

221
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,364
Listen,

222
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,492
l love what the movement has given me,

223
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:09,371
but l don't understand
why l have to live like that to love God.

224
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,290
Are they making you stay?

225
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,792
lt's just Lakshmi.

226
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,045
-So you don't wanna share, huh?
-You don't understand.

227
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,174
l want to make a life with her, but not there.

228
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,509
So what does that have to do with me?

229
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,762
She was a runaway, and she won't leave

230
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,390
unless she knows
she won't wind up back on the streets.

231
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,142
You want money. l knew it.

232
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,560
You know what? Go eat by yourself.

233
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,895
Stop, stop.

234
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,688
Money solves today, not tomorrow.

235
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,565
Up here on the right.

236
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,526
And for your information,
Prabhupad is buying.

237
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,947
l'm sorry l said

238
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,492
l couldn't come because of the accident.

239
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47,910
l'm sorry.

240
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,870
Excuse me.

241
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,712
"Can you help me, doctor?" l asked him.

242
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,467
"lt started... lt started," l said,

243
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,386
"when l was sitting in front
of the television set

244
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,222
"with my feet on the coffee table.

245
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,974
"Now, l've sat there hundreds of times,

246
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:14,311
"thousands maybe,
with a can of beer in my hand.

247
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:18,023
"l like to have a can of beer in my hand
when l watch the beer ads.

248
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,985
"But now, for no reason l could think of,

249
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,780
"the ad was making me sick.

250
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,242
"So l used the remote control
to get to another channel,

251
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,161
"but each channel made me just as sick.

252
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,830
"The television was one thing,

253
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,917
"and l was a person,
and l was going to be sick.

254
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,127
"So l turned it off

255
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,421
"and had a panicky moment.

256
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,674
"l smelled the beer in my hand.

257
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,468
"And as l vomited,
l looked around the living room

258
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,428
"for something to grab onto."

259
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,849
-Do you want something to eat?
-Nope.

260
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,895
Come on.

261
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,022
l didn't have dinner.

262
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,109
-You want a drink?
-Yep.

263
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,070
"Yep. Nope."

264
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,698
Should have been our wedding vows.

265
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,324
l'm just tired.

266
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,368
No, you're not.

267
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,746
l don't understand.

268
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,708
l've heard you say
a lot worse things about advertising.

269
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,919
The mighty theater
punches its audience in the face

270
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,964
with its subtle message.
There's a challenge.

271
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,801
Let me tell you, people buy things
because it makes them feel better.

272
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,928
We could have had dinner with Charles.

273
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,389
He's an understudy.
That may be his only performance.

274
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,890
l don't mind picking up
the check for your friends,

275
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,393
-but not if they insult me first.
-l'm sorry.

276
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,563
People make fun of acting all the time,
and you love it.

277
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,066
And l didn't think it was
such a strong stand against advertising

278
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,235
as much as the emptiness of consumerism.

279
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,864
No one's made a stronger stand
against advertising than you.

280
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:03,503
You know, l was scared when Bea was born,
but she's such a joy.

281
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,507
l actually saw
her face float by while l was chanting.

282
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,302
Really? You had a vision?

283
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,346
l guess.

284
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:17,351
And you kind of think
you're tied to this person forever.

285
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,771
Not my little girl. You know, Jennifer.

286
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,230
And now with another one on the way...

287
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,359
l want a family with Lakshmi.

288
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,194
And a farm, maybe outside Frisco.

289
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,529
You're gonna have to do
a little less recruiting

290
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,239
and a little more working.

291
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,116
About that...

292
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:36,078
l don't have a job for you, Paul.
l've thought about that.

293
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,329
lt's the whole reason l didn't wanna see you.

294
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,540
But you can help me
because l have been working.

295
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,878
You've been writing?

296
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,382
l think this is the most meaningful
work l've ever done in my life.

297
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:54,262
lt's a speculative episode
of the hit television show Star Trek.

298
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:57,891
Are you kidding me?

299
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,810
l think it should be
their season opener next year.

300
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,561
lf there is one.

301
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,772
lt's a tough time slot.
My Three Sons, Bewitched,

302
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,066
-that thing's a juggernaut.
-lt'll be there.

303
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,651
Where the hell do you watch it?

304
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,070
Through the window
of a pizza parlor on MacDougal.

305
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,823
-What, do you lip-read?
-l've seen the show,

306
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:16,118
and l think l've made a good effort
at matching the moral complexities

307
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,078
tinged with adventure that draw people to it.

308
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,331
Just read the first 1 5 pages.

309
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,250
lf you don't think
it's good enough for network television,

310
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,503
then you don't have to
pass it along to the executives at NBC

311
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:30,090
or even think about trying
to get it to Mr. Roddenberry.

312
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,551
That's kind of a line you don't cross, Paul.

313
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,803
Who do you think you're talking to?

314
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,764
How much do you buy at NBC?
You don't have any leverage?

315
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,100
Okay.

316
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,187
-ls it about Hare Krishna?
-No.

317
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:47,274
Not literally,
but they don't tell literal stories.

318
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,446
Look, you had a vision your first time.

319
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,991
Not that l wasn't
in a state of bliss for the first few months,

320
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,201
but something happened.

321
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,287
l try to clear my head, but l can't.

322
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,581
lt's too busy in there.

323
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,916
Everybody else looks so happy.

324
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,545
You know, l got there
and l started trying to figure out

325
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,380
who Prabhupad likes best.

326
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,591
lt's the same as everywhere l go.

327
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,885
He doesn't like me.

328
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,219
No one likes me.

329
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:19,347
Sometimes l think Krishna
doesn't even like me.

330
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,683
No one but Lakshmi.

331
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,897
Will you read the script?

332
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,844
Can l ask you something?

333
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,179
Why didn't you bring in Paul Kinsey
when you hired Ginsberg?

334
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,389
He wasn't submitted.

335
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,684
-You didn't consider him?
-Was l supposed to?

336
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,561
As far as l know, he was at McCann,

337
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,773
and then Y&R, then he rolled
downhill through K&E and B&B.

338
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,775
And last thing l heard,
he was in-house at A.M.P.

339
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,402
Who's A.M.P.?

340
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,571
No, l'm sorry. The A.M.P.

341
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,200
Will you read a script
he wrote for Star Trek?

342
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,161
Harry, if he asked you to pass it along,

343
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,537
l don't think this is what he meant.

344
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:50,415
l know what he meant,
but l need a second opinion.

345
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,542
Aren't you curious?

346
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:58,298
ls it going to give me a case
of the "nee-groan complex"?

347
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,467
lt's really bad.

348
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,678
And it's pronounced "neh-grahn"
because it rhymes with "katahn,"

349
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,890
which the negron
pick under slavery to the caucasons.

350
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,433
That's a twist.

351
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,353
No, the twist is that the negron are white.

352
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:15,482
Great. Now l'm not
gonna get anything done.

353
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,734
He really hopes this will change his life.

354
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,069
What am l gonna do?

355
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,404
You really wanna help him, don't you?

356
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:24,783
So what?
Really, do you know how lucky we are?

357
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,994
lf you really wanna help,

358
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,914
be honest with him
and tell him he needs to write a better script.

359
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,999
l think it was really hard for him.

360
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,168
Then he shouldn't be doing it.

361
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,510
Mr. Campbell to see you.

362
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,018
Send him in.

363
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,356
So what's your favorite Jaguar?

364
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,775
Did you send over a packet?

365
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,819
No, l drove them.

366
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,529
Someone drove me.

367
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,030
l don't know how to operate a stick shift.

368
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,782
l'll go this afternoon.

369
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,827
See that you do, because your opinion
means a lot more than mine.

370
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,246
Take Megan.
See how they deal with a couple.

371
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:13,790
We'll see.

372
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:18,128
You know, if l told you last December that
we'd be in the running for a car,

373
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:19,921
you would have kissed me on the mouth.

374
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,465
Maybe you and l should go as a couple.

375
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:32,308
Well, that is good to hear.

376
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:35,645
Pity having to deplete
the resources this time of year,

377
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,313
but it had to be done.

378
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,650
l've been assured the funds should
be accessible immediately.

379
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:41,735
Very well.

380
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,070
There is the matter of my fee.

381
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,240
Yes, of course.

382
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,242
After the holidays? Good day.

383
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,666
Joan, you have a guest in reception.

384
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,543
He needs a signature.

385
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,384
Are you Joan Harris?

386
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,303
Yes, that's me.

387
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,639
-You're served.
-What?

388
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,314
Damn it.

389
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,025
Why did you let him in?

390
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:25,028
-He said he needed to talk to you.
-About what?

391
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,906
l don't remember
everything everybody says.

392
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,824
Because you're an idiot!

393
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,951
Don't talk to me like that.

394
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:35,455
Do you understand having you out here
is the same as having no one?

395
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,458
He said he knew you.
He said it was a surprise.

396
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,918
A surprise?

397
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,670
Thank you for that. Here's a surprise!

398
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,255
-Joan!
-Surprise!

399
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,174
There's an airplane here to see you!

400
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,301
You're not allowed to do that.

401
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,095
-Come on.
-Stop it.

402
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,479
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

403
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,190
-Come with me.
-l'm fine.

404
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:06,653
Don.

405
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,030
Come on, let's go.

406
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,615
lt's too early for lunch.

407
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,160
-We're not going to lunch.
-l don't even have my coat.

408
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,059
Look at your watch.

409
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,603
Well, hello.

410
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:43,690
What brings you in today?

411
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,651
We got tired of waiting for a cab.

412
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,153
Thought we'd buy a car.

413
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,239
Let's see if l can get out of your way.

414
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,951
What's this one?

415
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:56,536
lt's the Mark ll.

416
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,955
lt's roomy, quiet,
good for a night on the town,

417
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,124
but can also accommodate children.

418
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,250
Do you have any?

419
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,336
Altogether, four.

420
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:08,298
This is a car for the American road.

421
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,758
lt's too much power for England.

422
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,302
They don't have the space.

423
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:15,346
Yeah, plus l hear the dampness is
murder on the electrical system.

424
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,223
We've worked that out.

425
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,894
Honey. What's that?

426
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:24,480
That's the most beautiful car ever made.

427
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,066
The XKE, or the E-Type.

428
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,694
l want one.

429
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,864
l'm thinking about
paying to have you drive around in this.

430
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,867
Go get me the keys.
l'll drive her around for free.

431
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,036
l'll have to take you out one at a time.

432
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,662
There's no room for three.

433
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,165
Why would we want you along?

434
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,667
She really wants me to take it for a ride.

435
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,502
l can't.

436
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,296
She can drive it herself.

437
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,340
So you're going to ride with her?

438
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,550
Can l?

439
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,637
How much is the car?

440
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,013
That one?

441
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,306
$5,600.

442
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,395
Here's $6,000.

443
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,774
lf we don't come back, consider it paid for.

444
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,868
l don't know what it is.
That car does nothing for me.

445
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,955
lt's because you're happy. You don't need it.

446
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,040
Okay.

447
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,795
You do not know
how hard l've tried to ignore this at work.

448
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,925
l know what l'm doing, l have some control,

449
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,471
but then he found a way to ruin that, too.

450
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,267
You're gonna need to define
some of these pronouns

451
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,601
if you want me to keep listening.

452
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:48,606
Dr. Captain Harris served me
with papers in the office.

453
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,818
He's divorcing me.

454
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,154
Like he has the moral high ground.

455
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,993
lt's hard on a marriage when you're apart.

456
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,328
Really? He loves it.

457
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,041
l'm sorry about that girl, but, you know...

458
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,753
lt used to be
if someone needed to see me in reception,

459
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,214
they were delivering flowers.

460
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,174
Those flowers...

461
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,470
God, my first week here
l thought you were dating Ali Khan.

462
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,557
My mother raised me to be admired.

463
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,434
But no flowers from you.

464
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,769
You scared the shit out of me.

465
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,856
Burt Peterson told me
you were the one person in the agency

466
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,607
l shouldn't cross.

467
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:35,111
He and Freddy had a standing argument
that you were a lesbian.

468
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,363
You think they never
brought that up with me?

469
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,410
Congratulations.

470
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,828
For what?

471
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,040
For getting divorced.

472
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:52,337
Nobody realizes how bad it has to get
for that to happen.

473
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,714
Now you get to move on.

474
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:56,716
To what?

475
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:00,720
To start over? With a baby?

476
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,475
On what date do you share that news?

477
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,769
Right after you go all the way.

478
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,940
You'll find somebody better.

479
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,486
You did, didn't you?

480
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,821
You found someone perfect.

481
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,073
l did.

482
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,079
l feel like the office misses her.

483
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,750
Maybe l should have kept her at reception.

484
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,965
l don't think you should
have thrown those papers out the window.

485
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,803
Give me some change. l want music.

486
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,185
Hello?

487
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,729
There's a Lakshmi here to see you.

488
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,524
She's got a whole story.

489
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,860
Bring her back.

490
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,571
Scarlett, please hold all my calls.

491
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,876
A pleasure to see you.
l hope you understand,

492
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:17,171
Jennifer wants to be
very thorough in our search for a nanny.

493
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,006
Thank you, Meredith.

494
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,221
lf this is some kind of shakedown,
let me stop you right now.

495
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,181
l know you're trying to recruit me.

496
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,225
Can l have a drink?

497
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,561
lsn't that verboten?

498
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,812
Listen to me.

499
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,731
l don't know what it is,

500
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,818
but when you were chanting, l felt this...

501
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,488
lntensity, you know?

502
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,867
Everywhere on my body...

503
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,953
Especially one place.

504
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,373
Really?

505
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:53,833
l was in such a state.

506
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:01,507
Stop it. l thought you were with Paul.

507
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,552
Nobody's with anybody.

508
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,347
Paramatma does what he wants and so do l.

509
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:11,767
lt doesn't mean that
we don't love each other.

510
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:14,061
So there's no reason for you to say no.

511
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,856
What about the fact that l'm married?

512
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,734
l'm burning for you.

513
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:23,321
Does your wife burn for you?

514
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,621
So this is completely allowed?

515
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,845
Take me like this.

516
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,855
Not even a little Sinatra?

517
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,316
Jimmy Durante.

518
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,241
Look at all these people
dancing to my music.

519
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:13,829
You wanna dance?

520
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,832
l don't think we should.

521
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,417
You sure look like you wanna dance.

522
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,378
You and me in Midtown?

523
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,714
You with that look on your face?

524
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,468
What look, baby?

525
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,846
God, you're irresistible.

526
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,601
You know what this woman
said to me once?

527
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,104
"l like being bad

528
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,606
"and going home and being good."

529
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,942
l bet that stuck to your ribs.

530
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,528
lt was a disaster.

531
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,948
And you enjoyed every minute of it.

532
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:54,453
God, l miss that.

533
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,001
There's a gentleman over at seven-thirty

534
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,587
who looks like he wants to dance.

535
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,134
Who do you think he is?

536
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,136
Advertising?

537
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,472
lnsurance?

538
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:14,974
Lawyer?

539
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,645
And who do you think's waiting at home?

540
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,482
l bet she's not ugly.

541
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:27,069
The only sin she's committed
is being familiar.

542
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,406
So you think it's all him?

543
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,992
Because she can't give him what he wants.

544
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:36,495
Because he doesn't know what he wants,

545
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,832
what he's wanting.

546
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,001
He knows.

547
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,463
lt's just the way he is.

548
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:49,050
And maybe it's just the way she is.

549
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,603
l'm gonna go.

550
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,191
-l can still drive, l think.
-l can drive.

551
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,526
You can stay.

552
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,197
l've been sitting with you
since he walked in.

553
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,532
Poor me, l struck out.

554
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,910
Who's gonna believe that?

555
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,754
Carfare,

556
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,714
in case it doesn't work out.

557
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,883
Mad money.

558
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:33,719
Thank you.

559
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,306
Good night, sweetheart.

560
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,393
Stand over by the jukebox.

561
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,437
That looked pretty good before.

562
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,672
Are you okay?

563
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:11,924
l don't know. l...

564
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:15,261
My heart's beating like a rabbit.

565
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,596
Smoking's not gonna help.

566
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,725
Don't get all strict on me, Mother Lakshmi.

567
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,103
But l am strict.

568
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,313
l did this for the movement.

569
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,442
Good to know, but l ain't joining.

570
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:34,488
Although your techniques
are more persuasive than...

571
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:36,657
Paul's.

572
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,451
You're disgusting.

573
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:42,455
l'm only here because l don't want you
shaking his devotion.

574
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,832
What? How does that work?

575
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,959
You're the worst girlfriend in the world.

576
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,211
And you're the best friend.

577
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:52,506
That's why you're giving him false hope
for his awful teleplay.

578
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,261
He wants to have a life with you.

579
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:01,056
And you know that even
if that was possible, that's not the way.

580
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,975
Look, he doesn't know that.

581
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,894
So why don't you just let him go?

582
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,480
Because he's a devotee of the Lord.

583
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,983
You're just a karmi and a sense enjoyer.

584
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,861
You wanna make him
into a gross materialist

585
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,655
when he's living in the spiritual world.

586
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,910
And also he's our best recruiter.

587
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,412
l mean, he really can close.

588
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:26,332
So l'm confused. Why did we just do that?

589
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,084
Because you're going to stay away from him

590
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:32,963
and let him be happy
in the light of Krishna consciousness.

591
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:37,676
You thought l was some confused little girl?

592
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,096
l'm trading the only thing l have.

593
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,517
But you already gave it away.

594
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,358
Stay away from him.

595
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,532
What do l do about the script?

596
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,201
Tell him the truth.

597
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,622
That always works.

598
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,064
You're drunk.

599
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,358
And you left work at lunch.

600
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,819
Where the hell were you?

601
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,529
You wanna get the rolling pin?

602
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:40,823
What the hell?

603
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,950
l wanna know where you were.

604
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,995
l left work, l test-drove a Jaguar,

605
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,706
had a drink with Joan,
drove around some more and dropped it off.

606
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,666
And you never thought to call me?

607
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,293
Why did you want me to think that?

608
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,711
Calm the hell down.

609
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,588
l put a plate in the oven for you

610
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,715
and sat here like an idiot,
waiting for someone

611
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,925
who doesn't give a shit about anybody.

612
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,848
-You like to get mad.
-No, l don't.

613
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,726
-That's what gets you going.
-That is not what this is.

614
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,436
Now sit down!

615
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,855
You're gonna eat dinner with me.

616
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,717
Do you want any cheese?

617
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,471
-No. Do you want...
-l'll clean it up later.

618
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:56,482
You used to love your work.

619
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,526
Well, it's different there now.

620
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:03,697
You loved it before you ever met me.

621
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:14,333
My mother is not a good nurse
and he hides his symptoms.

622
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,169
He's a rugged chap.

623
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,923
l do think more than ever
we should pay them a visit at Christmas.

624
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,967
Or l could just take Nigel.

625
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,260
Certainly we can afford that.

626
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,232
l shouldn't be sharing this,
but l truly don't want you to go.

627
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:44,279
You see, Edwin's left Jaguar.

628
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,657
That's why she left in a hurry.

629
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,535
lf he had been sacked,
he'd have lost his visa.

630
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:53,956
Yes, well, it allowed Jaguar
to come crawling back to me.

631
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:59,753
The firm can't do it without me
and l shan't spend another Christmas alone.

632
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,298
Darling.

633
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,552
l'm so happy for you, so proud.

634
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:10,472
Of course we'll be here by your side.

635
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,267
Christmas in New York will do just fine.

636
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,161
Don't get excited.

637
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,414
Well, get excited, but they're not from me.

638
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,125
Thank you for delivering them.

639
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,003
l had to. The girl in reception
is too scared to bring them back.

640
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,422
l also had to sign for them
and tip handsomely.

641
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,428
Do you want a tip, too?

642
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:56,977
How many times have l left you alone
with a card from another man?

643
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:16,455
Hare Krishna.

644
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,708
Great to see you. Well?

645
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,877
l've been meditating on the idea
that you have good news,

646
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,171
especially since you called me so fast.

647
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:28,926
Then l realized it's probably not,
since you wouldn't tell me over the phone.

648
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:35,099
l have news, but it's complicated.

649
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:39,394
They loved it. They said it was one
of the best scripts they had ever read.

650
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,146
Who?

651
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:44,233
The reader at Mike Weinblatt's office.

652
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,651
But he apparently can't give it to Mike

653
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:48,278
or anyone over there
because of legal reasons.

654
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:51,073
And you can never call him
because they've had some lawsuits,

655
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,660
but he said you have a future
and l agree with him.

656
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,454
Did you tell him l'll get a lawyer?
l'll sign anything they want.

657
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:00,999
Yes, but he was firmly discouraging
in every way

658
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,919
except in his unbridled enthusiasm
for the writing.

659
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,712
Really? What did he say?

660
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,256
Can l talk to him?
Does he want to talk to me?

661
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,715
Never.

662
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:10,008
But...

663
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:15,764
ln this envelope is your future.

664
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:18,350
This is your destiny.

665
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,519
ls it a contract?

666
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,521
They're not interested.

667
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:25,774
But l am.

668
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,696
This is $500 and a ticket to Los Angeles.

669
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,074
l want you to leave the Krishnas
and go out there and try.

670
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,869
l don't think Lakshmi...

671
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:40,789
l'm not giving you this unless you promise

672
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:43,083
to leave your things and go from here.

673
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,836
l don't have any things.

674
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,339
Good. This is all you need.

675
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,511
You don't understand
what it's like out there.

676
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,930
This failure, this life...

677
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:02,269
lt'll all seem
like it happened to someone else.

678
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,730
Harry, you don't understand Lakshmi.

679
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:10,360
lf you go back there,
you'll never be strong enough to go.

680
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:13,363
And then she'll try and talk you out of it.
And what does that tell you?

681
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:17,409
lt's $500. You can call her on the way
from Philly or something.

682
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:45,687
You know, all these people said
they'd do something for me.

683
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,981
You're the first one who did.

684
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,778
Break a leg.

685
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,288
Everyone's assembling
for the announcement.

686
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:06,124
Well, there's a little bad news
to go with the good.

687
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:09,878
Mohawk's machinists are going on strike.

688
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:11,797
Despite the fact that they're flying,

689
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:13,757
they're suspending their advertising.

690
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,302
They made so much money all summer
as scabs.

691
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,389
-What's going on?
-Mohawk's on strike.

692
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:22,099
They're suspending all work.

693
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:23,225
They're not leaving the agency,

694
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,893
but what they save by cutting the ad budget

695
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,979
goes straight to the bottom line,
and it's the end of the year.

696
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:29,731
Then there'll be no bonuses.

697
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:30,899
No!

698
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:35,487
No Christmas bonuses three years in a row?

699
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,780
l know.

700
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,826
They're going to be working
all through the holidays on Jaguar.

701
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,620
Fine. Just the partners will defer.

702
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,623
Even the junior partners?

703
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,750
Yes, till the end of January.

704
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,254
That's prudent.

705
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,589
Well, here we go.

706
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:56,717
Don, you up to joining us?

707
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,521
Lane, go ahead.

708
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:13,442
Well, we have a few announcements,

709
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:15,235
the first of which is

710
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,781
that we have received some bad news
from Mohawk Airlines

711
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:23,243
that they will be suspending
their work indefinitely.

712
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,540
This puts significant financial strain
on the company.

713
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:35,881
lt was our plan to distribute
Christmas bonuses this year,

714
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:43,722
but quite selflessly the partners
have elected to forego their share

715
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:48,894
in the interests of rewarding the staff
for a job well done.

716
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:55,901
You're all getting Christmas bonuses
and we aren't.

717
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:05,494
Now, understand
that the financial straddling required

718
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:08,372
is for a very good reason.

719
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,999
We've been included
in an elite group of agencies

720
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:13,210
invited to pitch Jaguar cars.

721
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:17,214
So congratulations.

722
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:22,511
Anything else?

723
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,096
Yes, actually, l'd like to say something.

724
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,348
Would you?

725
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,186
Last year at this time,
whether you knew it or not,

726
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,272
the survival of this company was on the line.

727
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,441
l look at the faces in this room
who have given their all

728
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:39,528
to this tenuous recovery and l say,

729
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:44,157
prepare to take a great leap forward.

730
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:48,995
Prepare to swim the English Channel
and then drown in champagne.

731
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:54,668
There are six weekends
between now and the pitch.

732
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,380
We are going to spend them all here.

733
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,673
We will celebrate Christmas here.

734
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,216
We will ring in the new year together.

735
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,470
And in the end, we will represent Jaguar,
and it will be worth it.

736
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:07,556
Every agency on Madison Avenue

737
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,767
is defined by the moment they got their car.

738
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:15,814
When we land Jaguar,
the world will know we've arrived.

739
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,658
Creative, in my office.
