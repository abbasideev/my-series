1
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:05,630
Hello, hello.

2
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:08,403
Top of the morning to you.

3
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:13,542
Green M&M's.
Nature's Viagra.

4
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:17,276
Two of my favorite joke areas
combined. It's gonna be a good day.

5
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:18,543
I don't want to
bring my friends.

6
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:19,606
Why can't it
just be the two of us?

7
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:21,277
Because it's St. Patrick's
Day. People go out in groups.

8
00:00:21,353 --> 00:00:22,377
Well, why don't you
invite your friends?

9
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:23,614
Why are you being
so weird about this?

10
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:26,658
Stop fighting! Just on
St. Patrick's Day, okay?

11
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:29,489
Just one
perfect day a year.

12
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:33,122
No hassles,
no problems, no kids.

13
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:34,826
Why no kids?

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,333
Yeah, where are your kids?

15
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:38,893
Nope. Uh-uh. Not today.

16
00:00:39,938 --> 00:00:41,337
It is
St. Patrick's Day,

17
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:45,002
and here in Scranton,
that is a huge deal.

18
00:00:45,477 --> 00:00:49,709
It is the closest that the
Irish will ever get to Christmas.

19
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,497
Welcome back, Dad.

20
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:15,597
Oh, thank you.

21
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:16,834
Hey.
- Hey.

22
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:18,001
Hey!

23
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,476
Welcome back, Tuna.

24
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:20,637
Hey.

25
00:01:20,712 --> 00:01:24,239
Very good. Okay, we'll get
back to you on that right away. Thanks.

26
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:27,375
What do we got here?

27
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:28,977
Mega-desk.
Of course.

28
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:30,385
Command central.
Mmm-hmm.

29
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:32,651
Surveillance, gaming
and business.

30
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:34,954
Okay.

31
00:01:38,997 --> 00:01:43,058
What? Come on. Jim!

32
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:45,059
Tweedledee and
Tweedle Dumbass

33
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:47,037
have been away
on maternity leave,

34
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,973
but now Tweedle Dumbass is
back and we have a problem.

35
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:53,500
Yes, getting hooked on
mega-desk was my own damn fault.

36
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:56,212
I don't care
about assigning blame.

37
00:01:56,982 --> 00:01:59,644
All I care about is mega-desk.

38
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:05,020
That is all I care about.
Getting more mega-desk.

39
00:02:06,258 --> 00:02:09,056
Oh, I love this.
So much fun.

40
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,619
There's such team spirit
in this room.

41
00:02:11,697 --> 00:02:13,392
Morning, darling.
Morning.

42
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:16,059
Well, this is my last day at
the Scranton branch for a while,

43
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:18,069
but I'm leaving it in
the very capable hands

44
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:20,571
of some of the loveliest people I've
ever had the pleasure of knowing.

45
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,107
You know,
I'm gonna miss this place,

46
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:24,437
and the snow.

47
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,708
Do my dogs
love peeing in that snow!

48
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,771
Makes me think
they're onto something.

49
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,417
Oh, good morning,
sweetheart.

50
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:35,544
Good morning, honey pile.

51
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:37,953
I'm sorry, but is that a
gift I see in your hands?

52
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:40,491
It is. This is a
little something for you

53
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:43,255
to remember your time here
in Scranton by.

54
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:45,856
Is that a lump of coal?

55
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:46,955
Yes, it is.

56
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:48,124
I haven't been that naughty.

57
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,135
No, no, no. That is
a good gift, actually.

58
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:54,001
Buildings here in Scranton
are literally powered by coal.

59
00:02:54,072 --> 00:02:56,472
Uh... Thank you very much.

60
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:59,006
We don't get much coal
down in Tallahassee.

61
00:02:59,077 --> 00:03:00,635
I mean,
just alligators

62
00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:02,441
and some of the worst Chinese
food you've ever tasted.

63
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:04,709
Mmm, that sounds
great, actually.

64
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:07,650
Well, if you ever get down
in my neck of the woods,

65
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,380
you got a place to stay.

66
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,755
When you work for
Sabre, only one thing matters,

67
00:03:11,823 --> 00:03:16,487
and I don't care if you're a
loser or you practice bestiality,

68
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:18,855
if Jo likes you,
you are in.

69
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:21,156
And I am in.

70
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:25,463
Erin Go Bragh.

71
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:27,664
Andy "Go Bragh" to you.

72
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:29,468
Nice kilt.
Thanks.

73
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:32,042
It's actually my sister's
old field hockey skirt.

74
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,977
Erin and I have our first date
tonight and it has to be perfect.

75
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:37,538
Why? Because according
to How I Met Your Mother,

76
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:40,608
that's the date that your kids are
gonna wait patiently to hear about,

77
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:42,847
and you better have
a good story for them.

78
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,016
Nope.
Great.

79
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:48,116
No.
Thank you.

80
00:03:48,193 --> 00:03:49,626
No, no, no, no, no.

81
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:51,458
Come on. Come on.
Five more minutes.

82
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,021
Five more minutes
of mega-desk? Please?

83
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,801
Is this yours or mine?

84
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:02,305
They say that
no man is an island.

85
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:07,675
False. I am an island,
and this island is volcanic.

86
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:09,008
Mega-desk!

87
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:14,451
And it is about to erupt with
the molten hot lava of strategy.

88
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:18,152
Good Lord. I can't
believe I'm missing this.

89
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:19,918
It's kind of like that
lip thing she did last night,

90
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:21,983
like a half-snarl,
half-smile.

91
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,755
I get the sense
that she's very ironic.

92
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:26,559
Okay. Love you.
We'll talk soon.

93
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,358
Must be amazing
being a father, right?

94
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:31,663
The miracle of life.

95
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:33,329
It is. Big time.

96
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:37,671
Ah, that baby is just discovering
a whole wide world right now.

97
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:40,609
It's pretty amazing.
What up is, what down is,

98
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:43,079
who Mom is,
who Dad is.

99
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:45,912
Must be tough being here
with all that going on.

100
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:48,009
It's tough being here
for a lot of reasons.

101
00:04:48,086 --> 00:04:49,678
I mean,
you're here at work

102
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:53,122
and the baby thinks that the
refrigerator is its father.

103
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:55,560
Is that what
happened to you?

104
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:57,595
I'll tell you
what happened to me.

105
00:04:57,663 --> 00:05:00,359
I didn't see my father for
the first two years of my life.

106
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:03,890
I thought my mother was my father
and my wet nurse was my mother.

107
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:05,527
And that's
a common mistake.

108
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:07,936
Turned out fine
for me. But Mose?

109
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:12,800
Oh, same story,
different ending.

110
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:20,880
Hey, are you sick?

111
00:05:20,952 --> 00:05:23,443
Oh, no, I'm fine. I just
have a little indigestion.

112
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:25,785
In your nose?
Yes.

113
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:30,024
I'm a little sick, but I
don't want to miss my date with Andy.

114
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:31,289
I'll get better.

115
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:33,490
Whenever I'm sick it goes
away within a few hours,

116
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:37,365
except once when I was in the
hospital from age three to six.

117
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:42,099
Now, after all the talking
I've been doing, it's your turn.

118
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:46,471
This is a town hall meeting. I
want to hear what y'all sound like.

119
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:48,445
That is a great idea, J.B.
Thank you.

120
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:51,209
You know, I get way
too many ideas from the top.

121
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:53,148
Now, I want to
hear your ideas.

122
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:56,119
I mean, did you guys
know that Liquid Paper,

123
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:58,918
that wasn't invented
by some fancy engineer.

124
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,720
No, that was created
by a lowly typist.

125
00:06:02,427 --> 00:06:06,830
Oh, Jo, I have an idea
for suntan lotion soap.

126
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:09,123
You know, it doesn't
have to be an invention.

127
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,225
I have a question.

128
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:12,167
Oscar, homosexual accountant.

129
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:13,864
In the training manual,
it says that

130
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:16,840
there's a minority executive
training program in Tallahassee.

131
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:20,435
I am so proud of Sabre's
Print In All Colors initiative.

132
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:24,845
Any Sabre employee of color
is welcome to apply, okay?

133
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:26,441
Darryl?

134
00:06:26,518 --> 00:06:29,043
Darryl. Mellow, soulful,
smart for warehouse.

135
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:30,554
Okay, hush now.
Okay.

136
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:33,989
The Sabre shipping method
could be more efficient.

137
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:37,256
Combining inventory systems
makes sense on paper,

138
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:40,229
but printers and paper
ship differently.

139
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:42,766
It would be faster
to deliver them separately

140
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,301
instead of waiting
on everything to come in.

141
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:45,893
But you wouldn't need
more trucks? I mean...

142
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:48,906
Not at all. There's a
way it can be scheduled.

143
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:50,373
I sketched
this out downstairs.

144
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:51,466
Well, look at you.

145
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:54,910
Look at that picture
that you drew. Nice job.

146
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,743
We are very
proud of you.

147
00:06:56,815 --> 00:06:58,146
You know what? We are
going to tape that up

148
00:06:58,216 --> 00:06:59,683
on the refrigerator
in the kitchen.

149
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:01,582
I like this, Darryl.

150
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:03,716
I like this a lot.

151
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:06,553
Maybe you should be
doing your sketching upstairs.

152
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,751
Would you like
an office up here?

153
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:09,657
Are you serious?
Yeah.

154
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:10,922
Take Jim's old office.

155
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:13,362
Oh, I set my stuff
up in there.

156
00:07:14,466 --> 00:07:17,162
So, just give me a few minutes
to clean it out for you.

157
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:18,634
Yeah. I want to
hear more from you.

158
00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:19,727
Absolutely.

159
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:21,033
All right.
Yeah, thank you.

160
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:25,065
Okay. Any questions?
Anything on anybody's mind?

161
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:26,440
I'm leaving tonight.

162
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:28,240
This is your last
chance for a while.

163
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:32,147
No! Say it's not so,
Jo! We're gonna miss you.

164
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:33,946
We are gonna
miss you so much!

165
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:35,008
Don't go away!

166
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:37,384
Okay. Florida
ain't that far away.

167
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:39,184
Well, I'm heading
down there.

168
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:40,848
Well, anytime, now.
So, who...

169
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:43,656
How about
July 4th weekend?

170
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:46,829
Oh, honey,
you didn't buy a ticket.

171
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:48,160
I did.

172
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:52,234
Oh, honey,
I am not home very often,

173
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:55,604
and me and my relatives,
they take up the guest house.

174
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:57,141
I think you should
check with my office

175
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,439
before you book
any dates, okay?

176
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:02,605
You know what? In the
spirit of full disclosure,

177
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:05,510
I have actually reserved
a bunch of different seats

178
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:06,744
on a bunch
of different flights,

179
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:08,809
but there are a couple flights
that only have two tickets left,

180
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:09,876
so I think we should
pull the trigger...

181
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:11,149
Enough!

182
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:19,664
All right, everybody. Just
try to put a brave face on.

183
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:22,223
Let's follow
the chain of events.

184
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,460
Jo likes Michael,

185
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,430
Jo invites
Michael to house,

186
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,171
Jo doesn't like
Michael anymore.

187
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:33,936
Mmm.

188
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:42,546
Moving on up
To the east side

189
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:46,624
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

190
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:49,992
Hello. I want you to stop
what you're doing right now.

191
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,756
You are stressed and I
am taking you to lunch.

192
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,594
No, that's very generous
of you, but I'm all set.

193
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,690
No is not an option.

194
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,064
Yes, it is.

195
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:03,207
All right, well, if you need me, I'll
be on the other side of that wall.

196
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:05,368
Knock once for yes,
twice for no.

197
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:08,970
How many knocks does it take
to get you to do some work?

198
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,675
Okay. I'll be over there.

199
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:17,377
And I'm actually pleased

200
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:20,322
to be able to offer you printer
cartridges and toner now.

201
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:21,586
Jim.
Yeah.

202
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,252
Jim, sorry to bother you.
What?

203
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:25,023
My headphones are broken.
Right.

204
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:26,723
Can I listen to
my music at a low volume?

205
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:27,822
That's great. Great.

206
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,093
Okay.
Yeah.

207
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:32,933
The cat's in the cradle and
the silver spoon Little boy...

208
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:35,438
When was the last time
you updated your printer?

209
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,566
"When you coming home, Dad?"
"I don't know when"

210
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:38,666
No. You need to stop now.

211
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:44,375
We'll be together then, now We're
going to have a good time then

212
00:09:45,116 --> 00:09:46,777
Whether it's this time
or the next time.

213
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:51,383
The cat's
in the cradle and the silver spoon

214
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:53,788
Little boy blue
and the man in the moon

215
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:55,985
No, we can definitely
talk about it...

216
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:58,495
You know what? Can I call you
back? That'd be great. Thank you.

217
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:02,795
We'll be together then We're
going to have a good time

218
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:05,597
No, I know I need
to work, I just...

219
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,228
I feel weird
not being home.

220
00:10:07,472 --> 00:10:10,771
I am not surprised that Dwight's
using my baby to steal my desk.

221
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:15,575
I'm a little surprised
that it's working.

222
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:18,245
This fax came for you.

223
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:20,716
Oh, no, no, no.
Are you feeling ill?

224
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:24,219
Oh, no, honey, if you've got a
bug, I want you to go on home.

225
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:26,883
I can't have you getting
Callie and Jo Junior sick.

226
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,688
These dogs have gotta be in a
commercial with Dwight Howard next week.

227
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,820
Oh. No, I feel like
I could lift a car.

228
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:33,955
Yeah, but you sound
like death, girl.

229
00:10:34,032 --> 00:10:35,124
Now, why don't
you go on home,

230
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,565
take care of yourself,
get in bed,

231
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:39,195
and shred that and have them
send me a clean fax, all right?

232
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,328
Well...

233
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:47,712
She should go home.
It's not the end of the world.

234
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:49,747
We'll go on
a date next week.

235
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:52,942
She's still going to
like me in a week, right?

236
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:57,744
Yes?

237
00:10:57,822 --> 00:11:01,053
I was just working at my desk and I
wanted to run some new leads by you.

238
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:02,787
Oh, you're sick.

239
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:04,158
Dang it.

240
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:05,753
That's exactly why I sent
that receptionist home.

241
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,854
No, no, I'm not.

242
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:08,159
Getting everybody
sick in the office.

243
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:09,257
I have some
good ideas that...

244
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:11,097
I don't need any
heroes here, honey.

245
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:12,796
It's time for you
to go on home now.

246
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:14,236
You sure?
Yeah.

247
00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:17,604
You'll probably feel better once
you get some pants on. Come on.

248
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:26,350
Very nice.
Not bad, huh?

249
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:29,012
Real Hoop Dreams story
you got there.

250
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:33,517
Oh, man, you seem
to have caught Jo's eye.

251
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:35,525
How'd you make that happen?

252
00:11:35,593 --> 00:11:37,288
I impressed her
with my good ideas.

253
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:40,229
Seriously. How did you do it?

254
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:43,190
I made a suggestion at
the meeting that was good.

255
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:44,292
You were there.

256
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,564
How do I put
this delicately?

257
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:51,572
Does her family owe your family
something in terms of a past injustice?

258
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,407
Now, Mike, I have
to ask you to leave

259
00:11:57,482 --> 00:12:00,280
so that I can learn
about this tiny television.

260
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:03,453
Mmm, okay. All right.

261
00:12:07,358 --> 00:12:09,019
Hey, there.
Hey, there.

262
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:10,652
So, I think I'm done.

263
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:15,689
Gonna head out, unless you want to
chat, like we were doing earlier.

264
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:17,928
Well, there's chatting time
and there's working time,

265
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:19,526
and I'm still
on working time.

266
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:23,734
Mmm? Well, the clock
says chatting time, so...

267
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:27,778
Well, if you feel like you've
done a solid day's work.

268
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:29,306
Right.

269
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,339
What?

270
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,613
Well, I mean, if you can
put your name on this day

271
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:37,377
and be proud of the
amount of work you've done,

272
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:40,390
then by all means, you
should toodle on home.

273
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,519
Mmm...

274
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:45,953
Okay.

275
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,232
Is there something else
I can help you with?

276
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,767
No, no, no,
that's super clear-ish.

277
00:12:56,941 --> 00:12:59,341
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.

278
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:06,612
Just because
Jo has no life

279
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:10,450
does not mean that the
rest of us don't have lives.

280
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:15,019
Oscar has a life. I
think Ryan has a life.

281
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,589
This is outrageous.

282
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:20,686
Hey, Pac-Man.

283
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:22,255
Hey, what's up,
Butt Plug?

284
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,392
How you doing, stud?
You're already there?

285
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:26,562
Dude, I've been
here since 3:00.

286
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:28,265
I've boot and
rallied twice.

287
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:29,670
How's the lady situation?

288
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:30,935
Fat and ugly.

289
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:32,875
You might actually
have a chance.

290
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:35,208
Oh, damn, that sounds great.

291
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:39,477
Unfortunately I am stuck here because
my boss is making us work late.

292
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:43,612
Oh, here's what you do. Hike up
your skirt and pull out your tampon,

293
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:46,522
borrow some balls
and come meet me.

294
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:48,320
Yeah, maybe next year.

295
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:49,917
Maybe next queer.

296
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:53,196
Hey, ladies, who wants
some bangers and mash?

297
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:59,161
Oh, Andy!
Hi.

298
00:13:59,237 --> 00:14:00,898
I'm in my jammy-jams.

299
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:03,202
That's okay.
I'm in my worky-works.

300
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:05,440
You look amazing.

301
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,603
Thanks.

302
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:09,336
Come in.
Okay.

303
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:15,752
Hey, me and Creed are in.
Are you guys in?

304
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,615
Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.

305
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,020
All right.

306
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:31,163
Oh, you don't become the
most powerful woman in Tallahassee

307
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:32,760
by slacking off.

308
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:35,271
You do it by working hard.

309
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:37,774
Or marrying rich.

310
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:40,108
I did both.

311
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,614
Got a little client meeting
at Shanny O'Gannigans tonight.

312
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:46,513
It shouldn't
go all night long,

313
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:48,484
so if you'd like me to,
I can swing by your house

314
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:51,750
so the baby can experience
a strong male presence.

315
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:54,885
No? Nothing?

316
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,325
Okay, have fun working.

317
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:05,692
Hi there, Jo.
Sorry to interrupt.

318
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,897
This evening I have...

319
00:15:09,073 --> 00:15:10,768
Hello?
Hey, Jo, it's Jim Halpert.

320
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:14,573
I actually scheduled a meeting at
7:30 with a very important client,

321
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:17,911
and it's so weird, 'cause we never
have meetings after 5:00 p.m.,

322
00:15:17,982 --> 00:15:21,713
but I was hoping that maybe
just this once it would be okay.

323
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:25,078
Well, sure. You know, you go
ahead and push some printers.

324
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:26,145
You know I will.

325
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:29,387
And by the way, seriously,
we never, never do this.

326
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,722
Okay.
Okay.

327
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:32,228
All right.

328
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:34,456
Sorry, sugar.
What did you want?

329
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:39,194
Well, you see, I actually do
have a meeting with a client.

330
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,405
I'm gonna just
reschedule for next week.

331
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:45,573
Thank you.

332
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:50,370
Thanks again,
by the way.

333
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:54,380
Hey, what are you
fellows doing up here?

334
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:55,578
We're here
to bust you out.

335
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:56,642
I wish, but I...

336
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:58,814
Dude, is your
shirt tucked in?

337
00:15:59,457 --> 00:16:01,755
Oh, yeah.

338
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:04,158
I must have did that
when I used the bathroom.

339
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,761
All right, then.
Let me get to it.

340
00:16:07,832 --> 00:16:08,992
All right.

341
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:11,391
See you later.

342
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:20,808
Your hand's cold.

343
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:21,936
It is? I'm sorry.
Yeah.

344
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:23,071
Have some more blanket.

345
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:24,136
Oh, thanks.

346
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:25,204
What's up?

347
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:26,307
You're awake?

348
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:28,511
Andy, this is
my brother, Reed.

349
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:29,814
I didn't know
you had a brother.

350
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:31,912
He's my foster brother.

351
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,982
Well, any brother of
Erin's is a friend of mine.

352
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:36,321
Nice to meet you.
Andy Bernard.

353
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:37,986
Cold hands.

354
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:40,591
Are we rotating seats or...

355
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:41,927
Yeah, you're the guest.

356
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,468
Go take the easy chair.
Best seat in the house.

357
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:45,832
Plus, you don't
have to sit next

358
00:16:45,903 --> 00:16:48,269
to this big dork
and her smelly feet.

359
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:51,968
Hey. My feet aren't smelly. They
smell like roses. Smell them.

360
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:54,034
Whoa.

361
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:02,843
So how does the whole
foster sibling thing work?

362
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,514
Do you guys
share one parent or...

363
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,821
None. We were in the same
house from ages 10 to 12

364
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:10,793
and then from 15 to 18.

365
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:14,264
Right. Formative years.

366
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,557
Nice skirt.

367
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:17,794
It's a kilt.

368
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:25,607
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

369
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,482
Yes, I am anxious
to get out of work,

370
00:17:34,552 --> 00:17:35,780
but let me be clear,

371
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:38,185
it's not to celebrate
St. Patrick's Day.

372
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:40,622
It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.

373
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:42,716
Overnight all
my damn bags home.

374
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:44,728
I'm carrying nothing
but my sable gloves.

375
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:46,764
I've had it with
Homeland Security.

376
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:50,562
And I want you to put all those
tracking numbers in my BlackBerry.

377
00:17:50,635 --> 00:17:52,000
How late are we
gonna work tonight?

378
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,369
You never know with Jo. Sometimes
we're here until midnight,

379
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,670
sometimes she doesn't
show up for three days.

380
00:17:57,742 --> 00:17:58,834
Why does she do that?

381
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,775
Why doesn't she just tell
you what your schedule is?

382
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:03,814
Yeah. That'd be awesome.
I could get a girlfriend.

383
00:18:03,881 --> 00:18:06,042
I wouldn't have to go to
Amsterdam seven times a year.

384
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:09,348
But I'm young, right?
I will date when I'm dead.

385
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:14,852
Do I really want
to turn out like Gabe?

386
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,855
Twenty-six, single,

387
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:20,995
tied to my desk,
no life, no family.

388
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:24,796
I want to have been married by
the time I would have turned 30.

389
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:28,327
That's just...
That's just depressing.

390
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:31,464
Hello, Jo.

391
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,533
Anything I can do
for you, pudding?

392
00:18:33,611 --> 00:18:36,910
There is, as a matter of fact.
It's getting sort of late.

393
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:40,178
It's 8:30 and
it's St. Patrick's Day,

394
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:41,809
which is
a world ethnic holiday,

395
00:18:41,886 --> 00:18:45,185
so I have decided I'm going
to dismiss my employees.

396
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,648
Hmm.

397
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:48,490
I'm thrilled with the work
they've done today,

398
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,356
both the quality
and the quantity.

399
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:53,829
Great performance. Very,
very solid all the way around.

400
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:55,490
All right, then.

401
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:59,298
Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day.

402
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:05,567
And also,

403
00:19:05,643 --> 00:19:09,739
I would like to say that I will be
canceling my trip down to Tallahassee,

404
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:13,545
although I do look forward to
our professional relationship.

405
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:16,743
Michael?
Yes?

406
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:20,716
I look forward to that, too.

407
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:31,258
Oh.

408
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,233
It's coming down out there.
Yes.

409
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:36,466
Thank you
for coming all the way here.

410
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,738
No, no. My pleasure.
I'm sorry I was so sick.

411
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:01,954
Great. Now I'm gonna get sick.

412
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:08,228
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Hey, guys, how are you?

413
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,100
Drinks are on me.

414
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:15,472
No, no, no, put your credit
cards away! It's on us.

415
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:18,014
All right!

416
00:20:18,082 --> 00:20:19,549
Did I mess up
my career today

417
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:21,141
or my future
prospects at Sabre?

418
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:24,120
I don't know.
There is a chance, yes.

419
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:26,249
I'll tell you,
I love my job,

420
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:30,385
but Jo wants me to put on a show
for her and pretend to work late?

421
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:32,218
Nah.

422
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:35,996
I spent all day trying
to make her like me,

423
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:37,625
but I forgot to
ask myself something.

424
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:39,192
Do I even like her?

425
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:43,570
As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin
said, "Don't worry, be happy."

426
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:45,164
Whoops.

427
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:48,940
Okay. Okay. All right.

428
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:50,412
Best night ever.

429
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:55,278
What the hell is
going on back there?

430
00:20:56,887 --> 00:21:01,483
Yeah. We should be able to
have that over to you by Monday.

431
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:04,420
Yeah, no problem.

432
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:06,857
Thank you.

433
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:08,421
What the hell is this?

434
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:10,128
Oh!
This is not mega-desk.

435
00:21:10,201 --> 00:21:12,863
No, it's not. They call it "quad-desk."

436
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:15,435
That's ridiculous. This
is made up of three desks.

437
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:19,040
Oh, my God.

438
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:22,036
We're gonna have to
rename it then, aren't we?

439
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:29,546
Hello. Dwight Schrute.
