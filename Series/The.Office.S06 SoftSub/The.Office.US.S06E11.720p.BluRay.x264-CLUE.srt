1
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:07,635
Not again.

2
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:10,334
Bow down
before Recyclops.

3
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:12,104
Five years ago corporate
said we had to start

4
00:00:12,177 --> 00:00:13,701
a recycling program
for Earth Day,

5
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:15,246
so Dwight took
the lead on that,

6
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:19,307
and introduced us to a very close
friend of his named Recyclops.

7
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:22,480
Happy Earth Day, everyone.
I'm Recyclops.

8
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:23,953
Did you know that
an old milk carton

9
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,287
can be sawed in half
and used as a planter?

10
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:29,486
The next year, he
really stepped things up.

11
00:00:30,162 --> 00:00:34,599
Who has put a number seven
plastic in a number four bin?

12
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:38,193
A year after that, Recyclops
really began to take shape.

13
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:44,740
Recyclops will drown you
in your over-watered lawns!

14
00:00:45,477 --> 00:00:48,469
Then tragedy struck Recyclops
when his fictional planet

15
00:00:48,547 --> 00:00:51,778
was attacked by some other
fictitious thing, I can't remember.

16
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,377
Recyclops will have
his revenge!

17
00:00:55,754 --> 00:00:57,881
I think this was also the year
that he renounced Earth Day

18
00:00:57,956 --> 00:01:01,084
and vowed to destroy
the planet he once loved.

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,526
Oh, my God, you guys,
look! It's Recyclops!

20
00:01:03,595 --> 00:01:06,359
Recyclops destroy!

21
00:01:10,836 --> 00:01:12,963
Oh, is today Recyclops Day? Yes.

22
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:15,029
I thought you were killed
by Polluticon or something.

23
00:01:15,107 --> 00:01:16,836
Polluticon wishes.

24
00:01:17,309 --> 00:01:20,608
That's aerosol spray. It's
terrible for the environment.

25
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:22,647
Humans are terrible
for the environment.

26
00:01:25,884 --> 00:01:27,715
The thing I like most
about Recyclops

27
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:30,448
is that he's creating a
different world for our child.

28
00:01:30,522 --> 00:01:31,546
Hmm.

29
00:01:31,623 --> 00:01:34,649
A world where you truly
can be anything you want.

30
00:01:34,726 --> 00:01:36,091
God bless you,
Recyclops,

31
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:37,924
and your cold
robot heart.

32
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:14,524
Okay. Okay.
How about this?

33
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:16,758
That's great.

34
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:18,564
I want it to be better
than great, Pam.

35
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:22,095
How about I remain seated and
I just do a little bit of a nod,

36
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:24,165
sort of a humble thing?
Sure.

37
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:26,507
No. Then my face is down.
They can't see my face.

38
00:02:26,578 --> 00:02:27,840
And it looks like
you're taking a dump.

39
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:31,713
Alan Brand who's
the CEO of the company,

40
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:33,580
if title is important
to you,

41
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:37,986
has personally invited
moi to go to New York

42
00:02:38,056 --> 00:02:39,648
to the shareholders'
meeting

43
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:42,193
and sit up on the stage
with the board of directors.

44
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:44,855
And at some point, they're
going to introduce me

45
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,663
as the most successful
branch manager that they have.

46
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:53,831
And then Michael Scott turns
and waves to the crowd.

47
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:56,299
And the crowd goes wild.

48
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:59,874
Ladies and gentlemen,
from Scranton, Pennsylvania,

49
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:04,473
please welcome
Michael "The Machine" Scott!

50
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:08,310
Oh.

51
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:09,979
Don't do the twirl.
Lose the twirl.

52
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:11,989
Twirl sucks.
Michael, I hated the twirl.

53
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:13,217
Hate the twirl.

54
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:15,522
Okay, obviously I'm not
going to do the twirl.

55
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:17,391
I only did it because
I nailed the wave.

56
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:18,952
Yeah, good.
Don't do it.

57
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:23,297
I'm not going
to do the twirl, all right?

58
00:03:23,368 --> 00:03:25,131
It's not even a twirl.
It's a spin.

59
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,003
I might do the spin.

60
00:03:29,174 --> 00:03:32,837
The long-term problem is bad
investments that they need to dump.

61
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:34,572
And the short-term problem
is the company

62
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:36,307
has no cash and there's
nowhere to get it.

63
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:39,316
Okay, Oscar. I don't need the
whole enchilada, just bullet points.

64
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:40,442
Those are
the bullet points.

65
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:42,009
Well, could you
condense it, please?

66
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:43,554
That's as simple
as I can make it.

67
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:44,884
Michael, the limo's
here for you.

68
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:46,549
It's not a limo,
it's a town car.

69
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,956
Town cars are
actually better, though,

70
00:03:48,026 --> 00:03:49,755
better torque,
better handling.

71
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,125
He said limousine, so...

72
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:54,222
Check it out, guys,
there's a limo down here.

73
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,329
Michael, look.

74
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:06,810
Oh, man!
It's a limo.

75
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:07,936
They sent a limo.

76
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,380
Town cars suck.
A town car

77
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:12,474
is something that a company
sends when they're in trouble.

78
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:15,884
A limousine is something
that a company sends

79
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:18,980
when they have cause
for celebration.

80
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:22,585
And in this case, I think
we are celebrating me.

81
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,300
Move it! Quick!

82
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:31,598
Wow! Wow!

83
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,638
Oh, no way!
Yeah!

84
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:38,206
What kind of mileage
does this baby get?

85
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:41,144
It's like what high school
kids take to prom on TV shows.

86
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:43,875
So typical of management
to spend money on this.

87
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:45,883
Bunch of boobs!

88
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,419
Hate to break it to you, Oscar,
but some of us like boobs.

89
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:50,284
Calves.
Calves all the way.

90
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:51,652
I'm so jealous
right now.

91
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:54,487
Hey, you know who you
should be jealous of?

92
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,924
Yourself.

93
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:58,861
Because you're invited,
and you're invited,

94
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,955
and you're invited,
and you, and you,

95
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,523
and you and you and you
and you... Car seats eight.

96
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:03,898
What?
The car seats eight.

97
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:05,266
The limo seats eight.

98
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:08,101
Okay, then Jim and Pam
and Ryan plus a guest.

99
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:09,162
No.
No, thanks.

100
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:10,868
I'll use it
when you're done.

101
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,977
Mmm.

102
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:16,144
Whoa.

103
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:19,345
The Dunder Mifflin
stock symbol is DMI.

104
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:20,942
Do you know what
that stands for?

105
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:22,816
Dummies,
Morons and Idiots,

106
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:25,516
because that's what
you'd have to be to own it.

107
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:29,420
And as one of those idiots, I
believe the board owes me answers.

108
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:31,254
I wish the
windows weren't tinted

109
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,321
so people could
see us in here.

110
00:05:33,398 --> 00:05:36,231
Hey, guys, do you think anyone
might have had sex in here?

111
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:38,132
Definitely. Definitely. Smells like it.

112
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:39,727
Look, they got pillows.

113
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:42,000
That, that's bigger
than my bed.

114
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:44,304
Word.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

115
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:46,806
Who's playing
with the button?

116
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:50,510
Hey, Ryan, could you start consolidating

117
00:05:50,582 --> 00:05:52,277
all our Rolodex
information into Outlook?

118
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,080
Doesn't seem like
there's much of a point

119
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:55,312
if the company's
going under.

120
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:56,513
But if the company
doesn't go under,

121
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:58,249
then we'll finally have all
our contacts in one program.

122
00:05:58,323 --> 00:06:00,291
Company's probably going under,
though. It could go either way.

123
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,485
Seems like it's
leaning one way.

124
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,891
Maybe we should just
wait and find out.

125
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:03,985
Definitely.
Okay.

126
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:06,895
So should we wait to find out
before we start doing all this stuff?

127
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:09,160
Nah. Might as well
do it now.

128
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:15,772
Michael, what if somebody asks
you a question at this meeting?

129
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:16,967
Are you just
going to wave or what?

130
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,407
I will have to answer.

131
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:19,501
I'll ask you
a question.

132
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:20,704
Make it a softball.

133
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:23,270
Something he can, like,
crank out of the park.

134
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:26,442
Michael Scott, you run the most
profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin.

135
00:06:26,518 --> 00:06:27,712
Yeah.
How do you do it?

136
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:31,483
No, no, that's too hard.
Say, your name is Zamboni,

137
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:34,690
and then I will say, "Well,
we're sort of on thin ice."

138
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,818
Uh-oh!

139
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:37,327
I won't say that. I'll
say something like that.

140
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,991
This is your big day. Come on.

141
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,465
Whoo. Oh, my God. This is it.

142
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:44,662
Mr. Scott?
Yes.

143
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:45,998
I'm Laurie.
Oh, hi.

144
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:47,504
Thank you for joining us. Come with me.

145
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:49,733
Well, thank you.
And please call...

146
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:51,776
Continue to call me
Mr. Scott.

147
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:52,867
Okay.

148
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:54,775
If you just want to follow me
I'll take you up to the lounge.

149
00:06:54,846 --> 00:06:57,713
Well, I guess this is as far
as I can take you guys, so...

150
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:59,512
Good luck,
Michael. See you later.

151
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,918
Officers. Thank you.

152
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:05,013
After you, Mr. Scott.

153
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,387
Thank you.

154
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:08,116
Michael.
Hello.

155
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:09,387
So glad you could make it. Thank you.

156
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:10,485
How was the ride?

157
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:13,554
Oh. It was awesome.
Very, very sublime.

158
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:15,691
I'm glad. I want to
introduce you to everyone.

159
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:17,701
Okay. First we'll start with Alan Brand.

160
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:19,168
Alan, CEO.

161
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:21,432
Michael Scott,
Branch Manager, Scranton.

162
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,469
It's nice to meet you,
Michael. Nice to meet you, too.

163
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,874
It's an honor
and a privilege.

164
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:29,038
Seated, we have the former
congressman, Chris O'Keefe.

165
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:30,172
Your eminence.

166
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:33,851
For those of you with
questions, please line up

167
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,181
behind one of
the four microphones

168
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:36,481
that have been placed
in the aisles.

169
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:38,147
Coming through!

170
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:56,504
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

171
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:59,042
Damn it!

172
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:03,046
What... Okay.

173
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,908
I was hoping to lob Michael
a softball question early.

174
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:09,954
I wanted to swing by
the Garment District,

175
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,319
pick up a few crates
of my shirts.

176
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,914
I got a shirt guy.

177
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,822
Would you
believe this?

178
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,625
The money they spent
on this convention hall!

179
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:20,960
Excuse me, miss.

180
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:23,865
Just want to take this stupid
board of directors by their necks.

181
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:25,562
This is so simple.

182
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:26,797
Yeah.
Idiots!

183
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:28,772
Well, you should do that.
Get in line.

184
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,037
Oh, what a great idea, and
lose my job. No, thank you.

185
00:08:33,945 --> 00:08:37,244
Look, do you want to be
able to tell your grandkids

186
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:38,612
you stood up
for yourself

187
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:41,618
during America's
biggest financial crisis?

188
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:45,222
How is he going
to have grandkids?

189
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:48,250
You guys ever
protect the President?

190
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:49,486
No.

191
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:54,161
What about Madonna or
Obama twins? Anybody famous?

192
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:56,029
Not supposed to
talk about it.

193
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:57,227
Nelly Furtado.

194
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:58,496
All right, guys.

195
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:00,932
Are you ready?

196
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:02,439
Rock and roll.

197
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:25,661
Dunder Mifflin is
still a strong company,

198
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,994
and we are poised
to come through this

199
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:31,365
more streamlined and
profitable than ever.

200
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:35,867
This is not as much fun
as I thought it would be.

201
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:38,171
It was fun when we weren't
on the brink of bankruptcy.

202
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:39,676
We're going
bankrupt, you think?

203
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,473
They are really angry.

204
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:47,816
The shareholders need to
empower our leadership...

205
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:49,148
I'm just going to
run to the bathroom.

206
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,551
Will you save my place?
Sure.

207
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:52,180
No. He will not.

208
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:53,349
Excuse me?

209
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:56,519
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in
a household with no consequences?

210
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:57,653
It'll just be a second.

211
00:09:57,729 --> 00:09:58,753
Oh.

212
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,355
If onlys and justs
were candies and nuts

213
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:03,924
then every day
would be Erntedankfest.

214
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:07,665
...and we're confident
there are many things

215
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:10,537
to be optimistic about
in Dunder Mifflin's future.

216
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:13,371
And one of them is
here with us today.

217
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:17,674
Michael Scott,
Scranton Branch Manager.

218
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:18,974
Yes!

219
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,142
In these
uncertain times,

220
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:23,051
Michael has managed to
maintain steady profits

221
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:27,182
from his Scranton branch.
We all thank you, Michael.

222
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:31,819
Another bright spot in the
Dunder Mifflin landscape,

223
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:35,832
our new waste pulp
repurposing plant in Milford.

224
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:41,965
Hey, Phyllis, are you just
getting back from lunch now?

225
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,031
Mmm. Bob took me
to Capello's.

226
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:45,667
We got a little tipsy.

227
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:46,768
Okay.

228
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:48,540
Shouldn't be
telling me that stuff,

229
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:51,309
and also shouldn't be taking
two-hour lunches without telling me.

230
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:54,250
Oh, it's okay. Michael doesn't
really care about these things.

231
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:58,119
I care about them. And I'm just
as much of a boss as Michael.

232
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:01,789
What's so funny?
I'm a co-manager.

233
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,259
That doesn't
make you a boss.

234
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:05,523
It's not like you can
fire people or anything.

235
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:09,132
Who... How did you...
Who told you this?

236
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,997
We can't say.
Ryan.

237
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:12,627
Sorry. I'm plastered.

238
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:14,672
Okay, who else
has heard the rumor

239
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:17,537
that I am not as much
in charge as Michael?

240
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,976
Stuff gets around.
I don't participate.

241
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:27,310
Who here heard it
from Ryan?

242
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:29,112
Does an e-mail count?

243
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:30,245
Yes.

244
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:31,845
Then, yeah.

245
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:33,948
I am just as much
of a boss as Michael,

246
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:36,255
and I can do anything
that Michael can do.

247
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:37,692
All right?

248
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:40,390
Who here believes that I
have as much power as Michael?

249
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:49,133
I forgot I have to support
him, no matter what.

250
00:11:49,207 --> 00:11:50,538
Close one.

251
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:52,242
These questions
are bush league.

252
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,608
You should get up
and say something.

253
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,909
You got to be true
to what's in there.

254
00:11:58,116 --> 00:11:59,174
Don't be a wuss.

255
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,810
I've always been the guy who
can rally other people to rebel.

256
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:04,878
In high school I organized a
walkout over standardized testing.

257
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:08,221
Got over 500 students
to just skip the SATs.

258
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:10,022
At the last second, I
chickened out, took it anyway.

259
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:12,928
Got a 1220.
Always regretted it.

260
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:15,326
I feel lachrymose.

261
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:19,997
Believe me, everyone
is working very hard,

262
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:23,302
working weekends, struggling,
trying to right the ship.

263
00:12:23,374 --> 00:12:24,500
You're criminals!

264
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:28,444
Hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry.
These are not criminals.

265
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:32,349
They're nice. They invited
me to come here today.

266
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:35,144
They invited me to
their hospitality suite,

267
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,087
where I had free food
and it was delicious.

268
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:40,314
Get this, you know
how nice they are?

269
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:42,018
They sent
a stretch limo

270
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:44,220
all the way to pick me up in Scranton.

271
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:46,456
Limousine?
Yes.

272
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:47,998
You're all corrupt!
You should be in jail!

273
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:53,160
Quiet! Quiet, please!
Please, quiet!

274
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:57,797
Quiet, please! We want
to hear your questions.

275
00:12:58,443 --> 00:13:02,209
Do you love her, or do
you love the idea of her?

276
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,612
I don't know, man.
I just don't know.

277
00:13:04,682 --> 00:13:07,708
I've got to make an example out
of him. Should I just fire him?

278
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,481
Can you actually
fire people?

279
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:10,816
To be honest,
I don't know.

280
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:13,380
But maybe I could just yell
at him in front of people.

281
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,688
Well, I can't really imagine
you yelling at anyone.

282
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,694
Oh, I yell.
You've heard me yell.

283
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:20,026
Okay. I've
heard you exclaim.

284
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:23,465
Like the time you said, "Hey,
look, we parked over here!"

285
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:24,559
Well, that was
apple-picking day.

286
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:25,796
There was no need
to yell that day.

287
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,997
You know, I was just
excited to find the car.

288
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:30,267
Perfect end
to a perfect day.

289
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:33,104
Well, you'll
figure it out.

290
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:38,881
Okay, we're going to take
a 15-minute break,

291
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,884
and then we're going to
answer more questions.

292
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:42,112
You haven't said
anything yet

293
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:43,654
and we're headed
for bankruptcy!

294
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:45,278
Yeah!
Yeah!

295
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:48,018
Yeah, well, that's not going to
happen. That's not going to happen.

296
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:49,684
We'll be back
with some answers.

297
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:51,956
- What?
- What answers?

298
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,090
Okay, I know that
you're mad at me

299
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,224
and you're mad
at all of them...

300
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:58,132
How are you going to
fix the company?

301
00:13:58,203 --> 00:14:00,103
Okay. All right.

302
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:03,238
All right.

303
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:06,539
We are going to go out
there during this break

304
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:09,444
and we're going to
come back with a plan.

305
00:14:09,747 --> 00:14:11,408
We're going to come back
with a plan for you.

306
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:13,473
It's a 45-day plan.

307
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:16,677
Forty-five days to
get us back on track.

308
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:19,947
Forty-five points.

309
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,617
It's a 45-day, 45-point,
one point per day,

310
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:25,856
we get to 45 points,
we're back in business!

311
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:30,900
And you can take
that to the bank!

312
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:32,826
And, limo lady,

313
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:36,103
we are going completely
carbon-neutral!

314
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,877
I love you, New York!

315
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:02,659
You! You!

316
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:05,669
Hey, Ryan,
how's it going?

317
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,403
Here's the thing.

318
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:10,441
I've tried it, like, five
different ways in my head and...

319
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:14,137
Oh. Got one.
I'm such a perfectionist

320
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:17,878
that I'd kind of rather not do it
at all than do a crappy version.

321
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:20,440
Simple data entry, though. So
there's really only one way to do it.

322
00:15:20,518 --> 00:15:22,452
Sounds like you have a
really specific vision for it.

323
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,953
Do you want to maybe
just take a whack at it?

324
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:25,250
You know what?
What?

325
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:26,585
I think I know the problem. Great.

326
00:15:26,658 --> 00:15:27,784
I think
you seem distracted.

327
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:29,190
Yep, that is
the problem.

328
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,557
And you know what, I
came up with something

329
00:15:30,628 --> 00:15:31,959
that I think is
really gonna help.

330
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,622
Well, I'm glad you're
finally being proactive, Jim.

331
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:35,858
I am, too.
Let me show you.

332
00:15:38,102 --> 00:15:40,570
Wow, things are
really picking up.

333
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:41,935
What was that about?

334
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:43,064
What?

335
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:44,733
You were supposed to wave.

336
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:46,674
I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.

337
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:48,109
What are we supposed
to tell them now?

338
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:49,510
Okay, you've dug us
quite a hole.

339
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,980
We tell them the plan.
Right?

340
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,449
There is no plan.

341
00:15:56,654 --> 00:15:58,417
Here's what
we're going to do.

342
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:01,356
The 45-day thing that I
outlined, we go with that.

343
00:16:01,492 --> 00:16:02,925
Day 45, company saved.

344
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:05,087
Day 44, go,
what have we got?

345
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:06,187
We have 15 minutes.

346
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:07,424
Excuse me?

347
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:09,625
Just whatever comes
to mind, shout it out.

348
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:10,861
Who the hell
is this guy?

349
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:14,268
I am the guy
who roused that crowd.

350
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:15,499
Yes.
Got them on their feet.

351
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:17,564
They were so happy down there. Yes. Yes.

352
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,041
Who cares?

353
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:23,143
Okay. All right.

354
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:27,444
Well, I know a guy, this
Mexican guy, he's a math wiz.

355
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:31,019
He knows economics as well
as he knows bullfighting.

356
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:34,320
And I am going to
call in a little favor.

357
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:35,916
No, no, no.
Don't call anybody, Michael.

358
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:37,291
Well, I'm texting him, so.

359
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:40,388
Please do not text
anybody now, Michael.

360
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:43,231
It's done.

361
00:16:48,606 --> 00:16:49,630
Oh.

362
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:52,574
There he is. Come on in, come on in.

363
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:54,406
Gentlemen, I would
like you to meet Oscar.

364
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:55,878
Come on in,
don't be shy.

365
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:57,972
This is Oscar Martinez.

366
00:16:58,182 --> 00:17:00,810
Oscar, why don't you come
over here? Let me present you.

367
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:02,443
Step up,
step up there.

368
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,786
Oscar is an accountant
extraordinaire at the Scranton branch,

369
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:08,086
and he has
a wonderful idea

370
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:11,026
as to how to get us out of
this murky, murky situation.

371
00:17:11,095 --> 00:17:12,187
Take it away.

372
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:18,962
I think this is
really going to help.

373
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:21,005
If you could just
hold up here one second.

374
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:22,505
Hey, guys, just
a quick announcement.

375
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:24,063
If I could have
everyone's attention.

376
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:26,940
Just figured you needed a place
where you could concentrate.

377
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:29,172
And not be bothered
by bothering people.

378
00:17:29,247 --> 00:17:30,271
Okay.

379
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:31,940
Let me show you
what I mean.

380
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:35,315
Your new office.
How great is that, right?

381
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:37,479
For a job well done.
Well, not done.

382
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:40,719
I will do my work
right now.

383
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,191
I will stay late tonight. Right.

384
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,728
I'm very sorry about
everything.

385
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:45,922
You're a good kid.
You know what,

386
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:47,430
it gets bigger
once you're in there.

387
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:48,795
Enjoy it.

388
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:54,332
Is there Internet?

389
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,241
Tell them what you
told me. This is genius.

390
00:18:06,717 --> 00:18:09,242
Tell them about
the cash flow

391
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,754
and the dumping of
properties and...

392
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:16,687
This is all good.
It's all good stuff.

393
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:19,127
Lay it on them.

394
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:22,098
I feel,
as does Mr. Scott,

395
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,963
that we are in
the best of hands,

396
00:18:24,268 --> 00:18:25,667
capable hands.

397
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:28,466
That wasn't what
you were saying to me.

398
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:31,471
He was much more
articulate

399
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,533
and that was better,
much better.

400
00:18:33,611 --> 00:18:36,136
I think this has gone
very well and I thank you.

401
00:18:36,214 --> 00:18:37,374
Okay.

402
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,940
Oh.

403
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:43,384
Hey, hey.
What were you doing?

404
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:45,081
Michael, I didn't ask
to come up here.

405
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:46,919
Wow, man!
What?

406
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:48,458
That was embarrassing.

407
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:49,891
For me.
For me, too.

408
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:52,225
For you and me?
You embarrassed me.

409
00:18:56,434 --> 00:18:57,662
Well...

410
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,230
That was a waste
of a text.

411
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:03,637
Let's get down
to brass tacks.

412
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,699
I think that we
might be in trouble.

413
00:19:05,776 --> 00:19:07,209
We don't seem
to have a plan,

414
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:09,371
so I'm thinking
I go down there,

415
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:12,814
maybe rattle off a few jokes,
congressman can follow.

416
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:16,915
He's our best manager? Where's
the off button on this moron?

417
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:20,116
I'm not a moron.

418
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:25,252
Time after time, my
branch leads in sales.

419
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:30,129
I have personally won over 17
Dundie Awards, so I am not a moron.

420
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:34,763
And I'm just trying to help,
you know? So, you're the moron.

421
00:19:39,777 --> 00:19:43,213
Yes, it is a thrill
to be honored by one's company.

422
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:46,341
To have the people that you
work for stop for a minute

423
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:49,386
and say, "Wow, great job!"
That's what it's about.

424
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:52,388
He can take the bus.
He's had his limo ride.

425
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:56,152
That is what
it is all about.

426
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:57,922
Not the perks.
The perks...

427
00:19:57,995 --> 00:20:00,156
The perks, I could
take or leave the perks.

428
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:02,358
Oscar, Oscar!
Come on!

429
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:05,231
But limos are for people
who make the company money,

430
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:06,895
not lose millions
and have no plan.

431
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:08,029
There he is,
there he is!

432
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:09,572
So we're leaving early.

433
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:12,642
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

434
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,042
Michael!
Oh, yeah!

435
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:20,651
After all, we are the only
ones with anything to celebrate.

436
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:24,415
Scranton! Scranton!
Scranton! Scranton!

437
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:29,355
Dunder Mifflin!

438
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:32,724
The gentleman
in the glasses.

439
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:36,092
Dwight Schrute,
Scranton Branch.

440
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:40,194
I just want to say that I have
been standing in this line all day.

441
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:43,096
And if this line
is any indication

442
00:20:43,174 --> 00:20:44,903
of how this company
is being run,

443
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:46,944
then we are
in big trouble.

444
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,710
Thank you.
Right, I know.

445
00:20:56,854 --> 00:20:59,516
And I just
want to say that

446
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,650
I believe that there
are options out there.

447
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:05,821
A take-a-number option,
like they have in a deli.

448
00:21:07,598 --> 00:21:09,156
What about
line varieties?

449
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:13,294
Like an express line for quick
comments of 10 words or less.

450
00:21:13,371 --> 00:21:15,999
That could move
much more efficiently.

451
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:21,272
What about ropes along the
lines that you can hold on to?

452
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:22,676
Thank you.

453
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:25,247
Thank you for
your suggestions.

454
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:26,476
Yes.
