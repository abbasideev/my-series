1
00:00:02,201 --> 00:00:03,691
I'm sorry, you guys
have probably noticed

2
00:00:03,769 --> 00:00:06,397
my stomach's a little
more sensitive lately.

3
00:00:06,472 --> 00:00:09,737
So, if you wouldn't mind
wearing a little less perfume.

4
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:11,776
And if your lunch
is especially pungent,

5
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:13,607
maybe have it
in the break room.

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,078
We would really
appreciate it.

7
00:00:15,147 --> 00:00:18,173
Pam is constantly throwing up
because of the pregnancy.

8
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,084
If she eats something the fetus
doesn't like, she is screwed.

9
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:26,250
It's amazing, a three-ounce
fetus is calling the shots.

10
00:00:26,925 --> 00:00:28,722
It's so badass.

11
00:00:29,294 --> 00:00:32,286
Phyllis, if you could
switch to a different soap,

12
00:00:32,364 --> 00:00:35,458
just for a month or two.
Yours is kind of perfumey.

13
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:37,263
Now this is getting
ridiculous.

14
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:40,100
Oh, gee. I'm sorry. I
guess I missed the meeting

15
00:00:40,172 --> 00:00:42,572
where we all voted
for you to get pregnant.

16
00:00:43,275 --> 00:00:48,235
No. I reserve the right to peel
my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.

17
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:50,941
All morning I look forward
to my afternoon cigars.

18
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:53,143
And I am not stopping
for anybody.

19
00:00:53,585 --> 00:00:55,576
I don't think I'm asking for too much.

20
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:59,055
I guess it's just the end
of courtesy in the workplace.

21
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:21,137
Watching people get sick
always makes me sick.

22
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:26,480
And, frankly, so does
talking about it. So, wow.

23
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,422
Well, what
do you think?

24
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:13,931
I spent all morning doing it.

25
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:15,762
It is really
special.

26
00:02:16,034 --> 00:02:20,061
Yeah, but aren't you supposed to
do that to our... No. It's great.

27
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:23,267
Well, it's just a really
important day for me.

28
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:25,242
Well, congrats.
Thanks.

29
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:29,274
Dunder Mifflin Scranton will
be closed today and Friday

30
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:32,078
for a company wedding
in Niagara Falls.

31
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:35,450
So please leave a message and we'll
get back to you as soon as possible.

32
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:37,216
Have a great day.

33
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:40,952
Believe it or not, Kevin,
firecrackers are in the "Don't" column.

34
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:43,085
So, you're going to
provide them, then?

35
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:44,754
No, this is a firecracker-free wedding.

36
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,695
What the hell? You've
got to be kidding me.

37
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:48,824
Okay, all of these things
are important to remember,

38
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:50,232
but the most
important thing

39
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:51,564
is that no one
say anything

40
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:53,161
about my pregnancy
at the wedding.

41
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:54,933
Absolutely. Because not everyone knows

42
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,304
and some people
might be offended.

43
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,536
Decent people everywhere
will get offended.

44
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,238
Well, we're thinking of my
grandmother, who we haven't told

45
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:02,610
and who is very
old-fashioned.

46
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,774
Well, you're lucky
to have a grandmother.

47
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,841
Some of us have to be
our own grandmother.

48
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,218
You know, Angela, you don't
have to come to the wedding.

49
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:11,756
Really, Pam? Yes, she
does. Yes, she does.

50
00:03:11,823 --> 00:03:13,415
We're all going to go and
we're going to have a good time.

51
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:15,426
Ow! He pinched me.
No.

52
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:18,429
Next time we're all in this
room, Jim and I will be married.

53
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:19,521
We'll see.

54
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:20,587
Thank you,
Dwight.

55
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,826
Goodbye.
See you later.

56
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,924
Bye.
Bye.

57
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:26,664
Hey, and don't embarrass me
when we go to Niagara.

58
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:30,269
What happens in Niagara
stays in Niagara.

59
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:35,710
Don't, don't, don't. You stole
my joke. Don't steal my joke.

60
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:37,214
No, I didn't
steal your joke.

61
00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:38,647
Yes, I said
that yesterday.

62
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:40,048
But you can say that
about anything.

63
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:42,780
What happens in Accounting
stays in Accounting.

64
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:43,912
Oh, yeah!

65
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,457
No, no, no, no. Please,
please. Dwight, that's my joke.

66
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:48,516
Yeah, but it's so easy. That's
what I'm saying. You can say...

67
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:50,255
No, okay. This is what
I am talking about.

68
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:54,459
When we leave here and
go up to Niagara Falls,

69
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:57,832
we are representing
Dunder Mifflin, everyone.

70
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:00,064
This is a very important
wedding for this branch.

71
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:01,765
The most important wedding
until I get married.

72
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,899
So I want you all
on your best behavior,

73
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:05,170
or so help me God...

74
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:11,071
So I will see you
up there in Viagra Falls.

75
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,718
Pam and Jim's wedding will be
the single best pickup destination

76
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:20,280
in the history
of the universe.

77
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:22,884
I stole the guest list
from Jim's desk,

78
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:26,761
and I search-engined every female
on both sides of the family.

79
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:28,356
Get out of here.
Yes.

80
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:29,798
Oh, my God, Dwight.

81
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:33,964
For instance, Pam's
cousin, Jocelyn Webster.

82
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,336
There's a name.

83
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:39,772
Two years ago, she was
selling a mountain bike.

84
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:41,312
Oh! Well, tell me
about Jocelyn.

85
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,404
Yes.

86
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:43,539
What's she like?
I will, I will.

87
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:47,608
Well, she's really into mountain
biking. But not so much lately.

88
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:48,710
Okay.

89
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:51,381
She had a couple
hundred dollars to spend.

90
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:54,425
I mean, if she was able
to sell her bike.

91
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:57,920
Is that all
you have on her?

92
00:04:57,996 --> 00:05:00,487
Well, if this is in fact her,
because it's a very common name.

93
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:02,089
Okay,
you're an idiot.

94
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:15,145
People don't think of me as one of
the sharper dressers in the office,

95
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:18,239
but I'm going to turn that
around at this wedding.

96
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,350
I thought, "How can I
take it to the next level?"

97
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:25,222
The hair.

98
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:28,325
It's the hair.

99
00:05:28,393 --> 00:05:31,157
Okay, okay!
I'm going.

100
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:33,756
God!

101
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:38,098
Hey, do one of you guys
want to sit up front with me

102
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,797
so I have someone
to talk to?

103
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:42,601
It's like a five-hour
drive-ish, you know.

104
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:44,141
Nah, this is
so much cooler.

105
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:46,006
We feel like we're in a
limo and you're our driver.

106
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:47,170
Hmm.

107
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:49,305
Erin?

108
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:53,112
Oh, no. That wouldn't be fair
to leave Kelly alone in the back.

109
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:59,079
Not only is Erin really sweet
and cute, she smells like my mom.

110
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,727
Hey, my aunt told me
something neat. Yeah?

111
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:05,456
She said everything with
the wedding goes by so fast,

112
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,226
we should try to take mental
pictures of the high points.

113
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,733
Oh. Wow.
That's cool.

114
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:10,893
Yeah.

115
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:12,797
Click.

116
00:06:13,171 --> 00:06:16,140
You blinked. Damn it, now
that's in my brain forever.

117
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,232
Oh!

118
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:18,640
Lousy picture!

119
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,043
We should have hired a professional
to take the mental pictures.

120
00:06:27,452 --> 00:06:29,317
Oh, God, wow.

121
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:32,018
Oh! I was asleep.

122
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,182
What? No way.

123
00:06:33,258 --> 00:06:34,657
Those glasses
are super dark.

124
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:35,750
Oh. Wow.

125
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:39,319
Okay. All right, we
need some tunes, I think.

126
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,831
You know what,
I made you a CD.

127
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:42,594
You did? That was nice of you. Mmm-hmm.

128
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:44,965
This is to play when you bring
a woman back to your hotel room.

129
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:48,199
Oh! Very thoughtful. A
little mix to set the mood.

130
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:50,165
Delightful.
Pop that in.

131
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:51,732
You're going to
like this.

132
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,643
Hello. My name
is Dwight Schrute.

133
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:56,010
If you are listening to this,

134
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:58,709
you are a lucky woman
Michael has seduced.

135
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:00,843
Ah! To be in your shoes!

136
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,485
"What's next?"
You're probably wondering.

137
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:06,547
Don't be scared of
your night in heaven.

138
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:07,849
Are you serious?

139
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:10,394
You want me to play that for
a woman coming to my room?

140
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:12,259
Yeah. It's practical.
My God.

141
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,388
No, no.
It's...

142
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:15,092
That's not
how it works.

143
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:19,103
Niagara Falls used to be, like,
a spiritual experience to people.

144
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:22,106
They stayed in tents
and it blew their minds.

145
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:25,706
But it's really kitschy now,
which is a lot of fun.

146
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:28,001
Halpert. Halpert.

147
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,103
And Beesly.

148
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:30,307
Tonight we're in
two separate rooms

149
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:32,577
and then tomorrow night
is the honeymoon suite.

150
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:33,640
Great.

151
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:35,345
I know, we're pretty excited, too.

152
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,047
Can we take a look
at the suite now?

153
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:39,022
I'm sorry.
Somebody just checked in.

154
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,456
Is there another wedding
at the hotel this weekend?

155
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:44,359
Oh, no. Just an
individual. That man there.

156
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,421
Hey, I got the room
the night before you guys.

157
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:48,727
I'll break in the bed.

158
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:53,699
I don't like that.

159
00:07:53,772 --> 00:07:55,205
I'm going to need the
name and cell phone number

160
00:07:55,273 --> 00:07:58,071
of the housekeeper responsible
for changing the sheets, please.

161
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:01,913
Hello, reservation
for Michael Scott.

162
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,174
One moment
while I check.

163
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:06,081
Their proximity to the falls makes
everything smell like a basement.

164
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:07,140
Mmm-hmm.

165
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:09,414
I'm sorry, sir. I'm
not seeing you in here.

166
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:11,115
When did you make
your reservation?

167
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:12,588
I don't have
a reservation,

168
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:15,683
but I want a room in the
Beesly-Halpert block of rooms.

169
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,491
Oh! Okay. Unfortunately, sir, the
block only applies to the rate.

170
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:21,191
I'm afraid
we're all sold out.

171
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:23,894
Dwight Schrute.
I have a reservation.

172
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:30,335
Confirmation number,
Romeo-Tango-G-seven-seven-four-five.

173
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:31,602
Yes. Schrute.

174
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:35,271
And I had spoken to Teresa
about a room with two safes.

175
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:37,076
Sure, no problem.
- Okay.

176
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:38,376
There's your key, Mr.
Schrute. Well, good.

177
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,439
Thank you.

178
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:40,951
Dwight. Dwight,
Dwight, Dwight.

179
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,043
I need to stay
in your room.

180
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,109
No way. What if
I meet someone?

181
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:44,553
I'm staying in your...
Come on, Dwight.

182
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:45,749
No. Michael. I would
do the same for you.

183
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:46,848
You would?
Yes.

184
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:48,859
Really?
Yes. Let's just go.

185
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:52,795
Wait a second. No, no, no. This
must be some kind of mistake.

186
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:54,798
This reservation
is under an M. Scott.

187
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:56,163
Oh!
This must be yours.

188
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:57,565
Thank God.

189
00:08:57,636 --> 00:09:00,434
Oh, no. Now that I don't have
a room, can I stay with you?

190
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:01,597
Um...

191
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,704
No. You know what, I would
say yes, but you can't.

192
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:07,836
And I'll tell you why.

193
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:08,902
Please.

194
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,174
If I have
a woman up there

195
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:11,545
and things are
getting amorous,

196
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:14,050
she's going to get turned off
if she looks in the bathroom

197
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:17,088
and she sees you brushing your
teeth with butter and clay, okay?

198
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:20,318
Okay, okay. Ah, ha-ha! That
was a test and you have failed

199
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:22,622
for this is
my room, okay?

200
00:09:22,694 --> 00:09:24,628
You would not share with
me. I don't have a room?

201
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:26,254
No, you do not.
Okay.

202
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:29,367
Ooh! You must
pass the dungeon wisdom test.

203
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:30,526
Jerk.
It worked.

204
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:35,232
When Mary was denied a room
at the inn, Jesus was born.

205
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:39,504
When Michael was denied
a room at the inn,

206
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:43,139
we don't know what happens because
that story hasn't been told yet.

207
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,244
Mr. And Mrs. Stanley Hudson.

208
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:51,913
Hey, Stanley, favor. Could
I stay in your room tonight?

209
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,390
Are you out of your mind?
I brought Cynthia with me.

210
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:56,188
Not in the same bed.
In the other bed.

211
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:58,161
I got one queen-sized bed.

212
00:09:58,229 --> 00:10:00,322
You are kidding me.

213
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:03,031
A queen-sized bed
is five feet wide.

214
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:04,261
I am not five feet
wide, Michael.

215
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:07,567
I'm not a physics major, Stanley.
I'm just saying, be careful.

216
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:10,904
Hey, guys. Hey, could I
stay in your room tonight?

217
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:12,603
Oh, gross.
Blow my brains out.

218
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:14,110
That's rude.

219
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:17,246
Michael, I have an extra
twin bed if you want.

220
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:20,148
You are going to be sleeping by
yourself for the rest of your life,

221
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:22,686
so you should
just get used to it.

222
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:26,748
So, which one
is Pam's grandma?

223
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:30,159
Oh, Meemaw? She's the
one in the teal suit.

224
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:32,856
She's the only 80-year-old
with no smile wrinkles.

225
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:35,695
Dad, remember, no mention
of the baby, right?

226
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:36,756
No.

227
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:38,359
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
she's very conservative.

228
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:40,300
So, mum's the word.

229
00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:42,340
Mom, Dad, this is Michael
Scott. How you doing?

230
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:43,431
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

231
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:45,203
Nice to meet you.
Who's doing a toast?

232
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:47,141
I would like to go third,
sort of bat cleanup if...

233
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:49,009
Michael, I thought
we discussed

234
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,708
that we'd rather you
not speak, like, at all.

235
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:54,217
Because it's just going to
be blood relatives, I think.

236
00:10:54,285 --> 00:10:56,276
That is seriously going
to impede my ability

237
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:58,618
to hook up with
your female relatives.

238
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:01,120
Pretty sure
everybody heard that.

239
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:02,659
Didn't move my lips.

240
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:07,697
Hey, Meemaw.

241
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:11,930
I wasn't sure about
your branch of the family

242
00:11:12,437 --> 00:11:15,235
after I heard about
your parents' divorce.

243
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:19,737
But you and Jim
are just perfect.

244
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:22,003
God bless you.

245
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,913
Thank you,
but nobody's perfect.

246
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,944
Well, I wouldn't care to
live if I thought that.

247
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:33,215
Mr. Beesly,
how are you?

248
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,259
I'd like you to meet Kristy Kelly.

249
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:37,658
Oh! Is this
your niece?

250
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:43,824
No, no. She's my girlfriend. Hey,
can you make room at the head table?

251
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:47,030
From quarter three
to quarter four, up 17%.

252
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:51,401
While his sales, down 2%.
It's all there in the report.

253
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:53,137
Why would they make
the bad man your boss

254
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:54,269
if you're
so much smarter?

255
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:57,337
Excellent question.
Because while I was busy

256
00:11:57,415 --> 00:12:01,078
trying to improve the company
and make it a success, Jim...

257
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,347
The bad man was busy
kissing the boss man's butt.

258
00:12:05,523 --> 00:12:06,547
Ew!

259
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:10,390
That's right. It is ew. It's very ew.

260
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:14,592
Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister,
Penny. She's also my maid of honor.

261
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,997
Pleased to meet you.

262
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:19,161
I'm sorry, it's Kevin?
I thought it was Gil.

263
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:22,838
She thought I was
your boyfriend.

264
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:26,275
You thought
I was dating this?

265
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:27,777
What the hell is
wrong with you?

266
00:12:27,846 --> 00:12:30,371
Oscar, it was
an honest mistake.

267
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:31,881
Him? Him?

268
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,584
Oscar, I would be proud to date you.

269
00:12:34,652 --> 00:12:35,744
I'm sorry.

270
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,617
I'm not gay.
I'm Kevin.

271
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:39,418
Nice to meet you, Kevin.

272
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,015
Yeah. You owe me an apology.

273
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:42,081
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean...

274
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,320
Are you seeing
anyone right now?

275
00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:44,554
She has a boyfriend.
He's out of town.

276
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:46,494
Cool.
Thank you.

277
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:48,998
I was the youngest VP
in company history.

278
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:51,399
More recently, he worked
in a bowling alley.

279
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:54,529
Tell her one of your funny
bowling alley stories.

280
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:58,007
How did Meredith get put
at the young people's table?

281
00:12:58,076 --> 00:13:00,567
She probably switched
cards with someone.

282
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:02,306
Like I did with Erin.

283
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:08,181
What? You
can't... That's... You're...

284
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:12,246
Jim and Pam, I can't tell
you how happy I am to be here.

285
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:16,219
Head table,
where I belong.

286
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:18,022
It's just for family.

287
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:20,291
Well, who's that one?

288
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:25,902
Isabel Poreba.
I got stuff on her.

289
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:31,402
In 1996, her 10th grade
volleyball team went ten and two.

290
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,609
What am I supposed
to do with that, Dwight?

291
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,977
That's a very
good record.

292
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:39,710
All right, so I'll be like, "He
is so sweet, guys, and so kind."

293
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:41,183
That's when
I'll do the face like...

294
00:13:41,252 --> 00:13:42,583
Like, "What?" Right.

295
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:44,315
And then we'll just give him
a little punch to the back.

296
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:45,822
A noogie. Although, you know what?

297
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,914
Never too married
for a noogie.

298
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:48,117
Never.

299
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:52,061
They have hilarious material and they're
going to totally deliver it wrong.

300
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,691
I would kill with the brother
stuff. It should be me up there.

301
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:58,702
It should be me and Pete,
not Pete and Tom.

302
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:03,106
Pam, you've got
the greatest smile

303
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:05,005
and your body
is really fine.

304
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:06,100
Smoking.

305
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:08,771
Hoping it'll make our
wives kick it up a notch.

306
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,781
A little more cardio.

307
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:13,450
That's not appropriate.

308
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:16,784
Hello. Hi, everybody.

309
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,346
I promised I wasn't going to
make a toast and I'm not going to.

310
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:21,392
Just going to do a little
freestanding comedy,

311
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:22,483
and if at the end

312
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,755
everybody wants to raise
their glasses to Pam and Jim,

313
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:26,353
then so be it.

314
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:31,164
Hey, what is the deal
with the Smart car?

315
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:33,966
How smart is that?
Those things are tiny.

316
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:35,733
Can you even drive
them in traffic?

317
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:41,006
"Oh, I'm so smart. E
equals MC squared. I drive a Smart car."

318
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:42,603
That's not smart
in my book.

319
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,944
The real smart car
is KITT,

320
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:46,210
from Knight Rider.
Knight Rider.

321
00:14:46,284 --> 00:14:49,811
That's a car that can talk.
Can Smart car talk?

322
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:51,913
Nope. That's not smart.
No.

323
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,150
And also Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

324
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:54,248
Very smart.

325
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:57,419
And everybody
can laugh.

326
00:14:58,196 --> 00:15:01,063
It doesn't have to just be the
idiots. Everybody can laugh.

327
00:15:01,132 --> 00:15:02,724
Nope.
Yeah, go ahead.

328
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,631
All right. Hey,
everyone. Thanks for coming.

329
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:05,691
Douche!

330
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,101
Aw! Thanks, Pete.
That was really nice.

331
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:09,639
I just want to say
how happy we are

332
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:11,140
that all of you
are here tonight.

333
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:13,336
And I want to especially
thank those of you

334
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:16,847
who have traveled from far
away to be here with us tonight.

335
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:19,110
Especially
the Florida cousins,

336
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:20,878
who obviously
can't take a hint.

337
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:25,113
Four years ago,
I was just a guy

338
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:27,589
who had a crush on a girl
who had a boyfriend.

339
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:31,323
And I had to do the hardest
thing that I've ever had to do,

340
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:33,557
which was just to wait.

341
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,400
Don't get me wrong,
I flirted with her.

342
00:15:37,468 --> 00:15:39,527
Pam, I can now admit in
front of friends and family

343
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:41,196
that I do know how
to make a photocopy.

344
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,308
Didn't need your help
that many times.

345
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,343
And do you remember
how long it took you

346
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:47,878
to teach me how
to drive stick?

347
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:49,675
Like a year.

348
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:51,442
I've been driving stick
since high school.

349
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:56,246
So, yes, yes. For a really
long time that's all I had.

350
00:15:56,321 --> 00:16:00,223
I just had little moments with
a girl who saw me as a friend.

351
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,590
And a lot of people told me
I was crazy to wait this long

352
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:05,595
for a date with a girl
who I worked with,

353
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:08,257
but I think
even then I knew that

354
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:11,566
I was waiting
for my wife.

355
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:15,468
So, I would like
to propose a toast.

356
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:20,001
So, if you'd all raise your glasses,
not Pam, for obvious reasons.

357
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:21,908
But everyone else, if you
would raise your glasses...

358
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,245
What's obvious?
Why can't Pam drink?

359
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:28,852
Pam can't drink? Who... I didn't...
I shouldn't have said that.

360
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,548
I don't know why I did. She
can do whatever she wants.

361
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:35,615
Though she shouldn't. She shouldn't
because she's an alcoholic.

362
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:36,717
Pam is an alcoholic.

363
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:37,783
Jim.

364
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:39,921
That's not true. No.

365
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:45,793
What we
wanted... The real reason

366
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:48,968
is that Pam's pregnant.

367
00:16:50,608 --> 00:16:52,337
Okay, okay, okay.

368
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:56,608
Hey, what I think Jim
is trying to say is that

369
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,574
they had an accident.

370
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:04,747
And you know what? These two
people, they're living together,

371
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:07,347
they are having
lots of consensual sex.

372
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:09,120
They were living together?

373
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:11,423
Yes, yes, they were
living together. Yes.

374
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:17,366
And you know what? You can't expect
them to be careful every time,

375
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:19,665
because, frankly, it's
just a different sensation.

376
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:21,329
Michael.
When you come... Well?

377
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:23,499
Am I wrong? They say
it's not different,

378
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:24,768
but it's a different
sensation...

379
00:17:24,842 --> 00:17:26,036
Oh, my God, no, please.

380
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:29,546
...when you use
something to block...

381
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:32,310
I think everybody knows
what I am talking about.

382
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:33,873
It's not necessarily
different for the woman.

383
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,975
Michael.

384
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,816
But it is
different... Okay, okay, okay.

385
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,378
Michael, stop.

386
00:17:38,456 --> 00:17:39,821
All right.

387
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:43,016
My point is, I said
what I wanted to say.

388
00:17:43,094 --> 00:17:45,460
And, Meemaw, I hope
you heard every word.

389
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,228
All right. Jim.

390
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:52,263
To waiting.

391
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:53,394
To waiting.

392
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:55,200
- Okay.
- To waiting.

393
00:17:58,743 --> 00:18:00,506
I should have known.

394
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:06,176
The hotel's television set had a
movie on called Brüno last night.

395
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,684
The remote control had so
darn many buttons on it,

396
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:10,152
I couldn't
turn it off.

397
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:13,281
So, I had to just sit there
while it happened to me.

398
00:18:13,357 --> 00:18:17,350
I wondered, "How could
they pick such a hotel?"

399
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,090
Hmm. Now I know.

400
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,360
Meemaw.

401
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:27,600
I think it was a
little touch-and-go at first,

402
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:28,730
but we saved it,
I believe.

403
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:30,865
I can't believe
it was me.

404
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:34,042
I know. I can't believe
it was you, either.

405
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:37,377
I actually think it takes
a lot of pressure off of me.

406
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:38,938
Is there something
about being a manager

407
00:18:39,016 --> 00:18:40,108
that makes you say
stupid things?

408
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:41,412
I have not found
that to be the case.

409
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:42,578
Hey, smooth guys.

410
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:43,711
I am so sorry.

411
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:45,255
Can you believe it?
He screwed up, not me.

412
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:46,585
Meemaw's not coming
to the wedding.

413
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:48,090
She's leaving
tomorrow morning.

414
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:49,456
Oh, my God.
Are you serious?

415
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:51,358
There's going to be
a free room?

416
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:02,272
Hi, Meemaw.
It's Michael.

417
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,867
Oh! You're that foul man that
kept talking about intercourse.

418
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:08,571
Yes. Yep, one and the same. May I?

419
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:11,914
I am actually
great with old women.

420
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:16,010
In fact, for the longest time my
best friend was my grandmother.

421
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:19,214
And then she met Harriet,

422
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,417
and now she thinks she's
better than everybody.

423
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:25,325
I want to go to bed,
but I can't.

424
00:19:25,396 --> 00:19:27,387
I can't turn that
television off.

425
00:19:27,532 --> 00:19:32,231
Oh! Okay, well.
Hook you up there.

426
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:33,360
Oh!

427
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:35,100
Thank you.
You're welcome.

428
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:37,505
It was that
horrible Charlie Rose.

429
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:40,908
Oh. Isn't he terrible?
May I?

430
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:43,006
Here's the thing.

431
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:48,043
Meemaw, I think you
just need to chill out

432
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,883
about this whole "Pam
getting pregnant" thing.

433
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:53,924
It's not 1890 anymore.
It's modern day.

434
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:56,926
And women have sex
before marriage.

435
00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:58,518
And I think we need
to celebrate that.

436
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,622
And I know, in your day, she
would be considered a whore.

437
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,864
But now, women go out
and they have sex,

438
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:09,839
and they get wild, and
they take their tops off.

439
00:20:09,907 --> 00:20:12,205
And they have pictures taken of them.

440
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:14,437
And we need to encourage
that. That's part of life.

441
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:16,844
People are like cats
and dogs these days.

442
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:18,040
Exactly.

443
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:19,946
This used to be
such a great country.

444
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:21,075
I know.

445
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:23,017
I don't know
what happened to it.

446
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:25,214
They're going to name the
baby after you, you know.

447
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:26,779
They're going to
call it Meemaw.

448
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:28,950
You mean Sylvia.

449
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:30,084
Yes.

450
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:33,396
And if it's a boy
they will call it Silvio.

451
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:36,562
Party, room 639.

452
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:37,692
Yes.

453
00:20:37,768 --> 00:20:40,862
Chicks are going to be off
the hook. Guys, too, Oscar.

454
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:42,371
Like Calvin Klein models.

455
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,237
That sounds epic.

456
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:45,468
Can we bring anything?

457
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:46,669
Nothing.

458
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:50,612
Except for $40 for beer
and any hot chicks you know.

459
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:53,514
Because that would help me
deliver on some promises I made.

460
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:54,608
Whoo!

461
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:59,247
No one from the office has been
to a real Bernard throw-down.

462
00:20:59,323 --> 00:21:02,588
If I was a girl, I would seriously
reconsider coming to this party.

463
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,426
But don't tell them that I said
that because I want them there.

464
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:14,731
And where do you
think you're going?

465
00:21:14,805 --> 00:21:17,296
I was just going to go down to
the hotel bar for a little bit.

466
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,842
Well, why don't I just
save you some time

467
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:21,241
and kick you in the stomach instead?

468
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:23,246
I just wanted to get out of
my room for a little while.

469
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:24,372
Mmm-hmm?

470
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:26,848
Okay, I'll go with you.
Come on.

471
00:21:27,818 --> 00:21:29,513
Never mind.

472
00:21:29,587 --> 00:21:30,713
Are you sure?
Yeah.

473
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:32,346
Could be fun.
No.

474
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:33,720
What are you wearing?

475
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,157
Come on. It's a casual, social outfit.

476
00:21:36,227 --> 00:21:37,888
Looks like you're going
to a fish fry, Dwight.

477
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:39,293
No, they're howling
at the moon.

478
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:42,355
It's suggestive to women
because of howling during sex.

479
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:43,559
Okay.

480
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:45,928
That's not appropriate.

481
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:49,505
Uncool.
Uncool, Dwight.

482
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:54,343
Okay, okay.
Come on, let's go.

483
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,139
Good, it's good.
No, it's not a good idea.

484
00:21:58,215 --> 00:22:00,206
There's no such thing
as a good hairpiece.

485
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:02,912
Yeah, but that's easy
enough for you to say, Oscar.

486
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:06,718
You have that thick,
beautiful Chicano hair.

487
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:08,718
So nice.

488
00:22:10,394 --> 00:22:12,328
I'm just worried about
the farm, you know?

489
00:22:12,396 --> 00:22:14,523
Mose hates to geld
the horses by himself.

490
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:16,429
Dwight, Dwight,
shut up about the farm.

491
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,297
It's not relatable.
Nobody owns a farm.

492
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:22,135
Wait, you're worried about
your horses? That's cool.

493
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:24,174
How many horses
do you have?

494
00:22:24,241 --> 00:22:26,004
Nine and three-quarters.

495
00:22:26,077 --> 00:22:29,046
I invented a device called
"burger on the go."

496
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:33,516
It allows you to obtain six
regular-sized hamburgers or twelve sliders

497
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:36,451
from a horse without
killing the animal.

498
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,613
George Foreman is
still considering it.

499
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:39,917
Sharper lmage is
still considering it.

500
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,355
Sky Mall is still
considering it.

501
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:44,292
Hammacher Schlemmer
is still considering it.

502
00:22:44,662 --> 00:22:46,186
Sears said no.

503
00:22:54,271 --> 00:22:57,570
Toy Story,
Finding Nemo, Up.

504
00:22:57,641 --> 00:23:00,474
I bawl the entire time.
I cannot watch Pixar.

505
00:23:00,544 --> 00:23:01,568
Michael.
Yes?

506
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:03,340
Drop this one, abort.
Why?

507
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:05,678
I found twins.

508
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,513
Oh, my God. Twins.

509
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:11,111
I'm sorry, you understand.
Nice to meet you.

510
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,417
Aren't they
magnificent?

511
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:20,060
They're men, Dwight.

512
00:23:20,197 --> 00:23:22,165
I love finding
a good set of twins.

513
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:24,326
Something is
wrong with you.

514
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:31,167
Yeah, Meredith.
That's cool.

515
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:39,372
You call that a robot? Try being
more robotic, okay? Like this.

516
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,611
Lame. What else
you got, Andy?

517
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:46,622
How about a little
bit of this?

518
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:50,727
Oh, yeah?
What else you got?

519
00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:53,025
Yeah, what
else you got?

520
00:23:53,597 --> 00:23:55,861
Did someone change my
name to Baskin Robbins?

521
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:58,458
Because I feel
like a banana split.

522
00:23:59,904 --> 00:24:00,996
Whoo!

523
00:24:05,643 --> 00:24:06,940
What else you got?

524
00:24:07,011 --> 00:24:09,241
Oh! All right.
Easy. Easy.

525
00:24:09,313 --> 00:24:10,507
Easy, easy.

526
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:14,073
It's going to be fine, it's
going to be fine. Pam's here.

527
00:24:16,253 --> 00:24:17,311
Pam?

528
00:24:20,624 --> 00:24:22,353
I was dancing
and I did a split

529
00:24:22,426 --> 00:24:25,122
and I landed on my
car keys in my pocket.

530
00:24:25,396 --> 00:24:26,522
What?

531
00:24:26,597 --> 00:24:30,192
I tore my scrotum. I need you
to take me to the hospital.

532
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:34,367
Andy, I'm getting
married in eight hours.

533
00:24:34,738 --> 00:24:38,469
Everyone else is too drunk.
Just don't let me die here.

534
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:41,477
Hey, hey, where are you? Can
you take Andy to the hospital?

535
00:24:41,545 --> 00:24:42,534
What?

536
00:24:42,613 --> 00:24:44,274
He tore his
scrotum dancing.

537
00:24:44,348 --> 00:24:45,337
What?

538
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:46,906
He is in my room
icing his balls.

539
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:48,952
What? Please stop saying "what."

540
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:50,008
Can you take him?

541
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:51,247
Look, I would
so take him

542
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:52,448
in any other
circumstance,

543
00:24:52,523 --> 00:24:55,048
but I'm pretty certain
I'm completely wasted.

544
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,820
Your brothers took
you out drinking?

545
00:24:56,894 --> 00:24:58,384
Uh...
- Is that Pam?

546
00:24:58,462 --> 00:25:02,728
Hey, have her come out. Have her
come out. It'll be like Coyote Ugly.

547
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,563
That's Michael.
You're out with Michael?

548
00:25:04,635 --> 00:25:06,364
- And Dwight.
- Hey-oh!

549
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:07,461
Pam,
it just happened.

550
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:09,597
Okay, fine.
I'll take him.

551
00:25:09,673 --> 00:25:11,300
I love you.
Okay. I got to go.

552
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:12,603
I love you.

553
00:25:13,177 --> 00:25:14,201
Are you pushing
me off the phone?

554
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:16,178
No. Let's talk
for a long time.

555
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:17,544
Goodbye.

556
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:18,773
Mmm.

557
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,247
It's after midnight.

558
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:23,846
You're married.
He's married.

559
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:25,980
That's not how that works.

560
00:25:26,056 --> 00:25:27,853
Oh, my God.
Congratulations.

561
00:25:27,925 --> 00:25:29,051
You're not going to
be able to talk back.

562
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:30,354
You'll have Pam
to answer to.

563
00:25:30,427 --> 00:25:32,122
She'll be sitting
at home saying,

564
00:25:32,196 --> 00:25:34,130
"Jim, take the baby
to the zoo,

565
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:36,996
"because I want to sit
at home and eat bonbons

566
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:39,535
"and clip my toenails."

567
00:25:39,603 --> 00:25:43,596
"Jim, hey, why don't you braid
my hair? I want to watch TV."

568
00:25:43,674 --> 00:25:44,971
Now you sound
like Kermit.

569
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:46,970
Are you sure this
is the right way?

570
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:50,445
Nope. I, like you, have
never been here before.

571
00:25:51,782 --> 00:25:54,250
Well, at least
slow down a little bit

572
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:59,722
because every little bump in the
road is major pain on my scrotum.

573
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,849
Look, I'm not the one
who asked you to do a split

574
00:26:01,926 --> 00:26:03,587
when you've
never done one before.

575
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:05,629
Well, I was trying to liven
things up a little bit, okay?

576
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,924
I was kind of
doing your job, so...

577
00:26:06,997 --> 00:26:08,157
My job?

578
00:26:08,365 --> 00:26:11,425
My job is to get married in
the morning. That's my job.

579
00:26:11,502 --> 00:26:13,766
Well, it's also to make
sure we have a great time

580
00:26:13,837 --> 00:26:16,169
at your stupid
wedding, so...

581
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:37,922
I spent the night
with the bride,

582
00:26:37,995 --> 00:26:41,089
the night before
the wedding. Oh, yeah.

583
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:44,296
She stepped on my hand
on her way to the bathroom.

584
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:47,997
Andy, did I dream that you
were crying through the night?

585
00:26:48,372 --> 00:26:50,237
No. No,
that was real.

586
00:26:57,915 --> 00:27:00,008
Why don't you take a picture?
It'll last longer.

587
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:02,712
God! Can I get
a little privacy?

588
00:27:13,397 --> 00:27:14,955
Good morning,
how can I help you?

589
00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:19,492
I left a pair of dress shoes in
a bag outside my door last night

590
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,529
to be cleaned and polished, but
they haven't been returned yet.

591
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:26,405
You must be Mr. Malone.
One moment, please.

592
00:27:26,477 --> 00:27:27,535
Thank you.

593
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:29,670
Sir, this
is the man with the shoes.

594
00:27:32,182 --> 00:27:34,616
Mr. Malone,
your shoes are gone.

595
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:36,750
They were stolen?

596
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,117
No, destroyed.

597
00:27:38,188 --> 00:27:39,212
What?

598
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:43,385
When the bag was opened by our
shoe-shine, the smell overcame him.

599
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,190
I, too, smelled them
and made the choice

600
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:47,787
that they must
be thrown away.

601
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:50,399
Incinerated, actually.

602
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:52,935
But that was
my only pair of shoes.

603
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:54,664
It became
a safety issue, sir.

604
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,104
Well... Damn it!

605
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:02,543
I can offer you
a complimentary breakfast.

606
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:05,073
Okay.

607
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,451
You have everything?
Cell phone, charger?

608
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,987
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

609
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:12,587
So, you sure you don't want breakfast?

610
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:14,419
It's the most important meal of the day.

611
00:28:14,491 --> 00:28:16,288
It really is.
I'm not hungry.

612
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,295
I ate a whole bunch of sunflower
seeds after you went to sleep.

613
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:21,923
And besides, I wouldn't want
to take you away from Pam

614
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:23,432
on the morning
of her wedding.

615
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,024
She needs you,
Isabel.

616
00:28:25,102 --> 00:28:27,127
That's really
sweet, Dwight.

617
00:28:27,204 --> 00:28:28,364
So, I'll see you
at the wedding?

618
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:30,168
You know it.
Okay.

619
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:32,441
Okay, get out of here.

620
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:33,999
Bye.
Okay?

621
00:28:34,078 --> 00:28:36,069
Hey, good morning.
Hi.

622
00:28:36,146 --> 00:28:37,135
It's about
damn time.

623
00:28:37,214 --> 00:28:39,705
I haven't gone to the
bathroom in a day and a half.

624
00:28:39,783 --> 00:28:42,650
Oh, my God, Dwight!
This room is a pit.

625
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,917
Really? Hadn't noticed.
Too busy knocking boots.

626
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:53,120
How can you
eat like that?

627
00:28:53,197 --> 00:28:55,495
I'm ravenous after a
night of lovemaking.

628
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:56,590
You?

629
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:57,656
Yeah, I'm hungry.

630
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:58,827
But I'm not going to
make a pig out of myself.

631
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:00,802
Hey, what was she like?

632
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:05,130
She was cute. You know, she
was hot. She was very hot.

633
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:07,700
She made love
like a tiger.

634
00:29:07,778 --> 00:29:10,338
Bride's side or groom's side or townie?

635
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:11,745
She was from Europe.

636
00:29:11,815 --> 00:29:13,009
No kidding.
Uh-huh.

637
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,880
I bet she had hairy armpits. No.

638
00:29:14,952 --> 00:29:19,389
Isabel was nice, but I hope she
doesn't think this is going anywhere.

639
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:24,186
Wait a second. You're not
into her? Are you kidding me?

640
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:26,058
No. She's Pam's best friend.

641
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,621
You guys could double-date.
Swap, maybe?

642
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:30,496
Oh, please.
Put a gun in my mouth.

643
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:31,829
No, you're crazy.

644
00:29:31,902 --> 00:29:34,063
Look, she's a dental
hygienist from Carbondale,

645
00:29:34,138 --> 00:29:36,698
and she makes love like one.
She's a bumpkin. Pass.

646
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:39,607
She's... Okay, do you know how
hard it is to be a hygienist?

647
00:29:39,676 --> 00:29:40,870
You have to take X-rays,

648
00:29:40,944 --> 00:29:43,344
you have to scrape the
plaque off of people's teeth,

649
00:29:43,413 --> 00:29:44,903
you have to tell
kids when to spit

650
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:47,644
and make sure that they're not
scared when the dentist comes in.

651
00:29:47,718 --> 00:29:48,980
It, it...

652
00:29:49,052 --> 00:29:50,952
You should ask her out.

653
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:54,349
I already have my
European girlfriend.

654
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:01,856
If your hat hits me in
the face one more time...

655
00:30:01,932 --> 00:30:05,925
That's funny. Your wife loved
this hat the last time she saw it.

656
00:30:14,578 --> 00:30:16,273
Oh, my God.

657
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:17,471
Oh!

658
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:20,273
Oscar. Angela.

659
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:24,380
Are you in
a lot of pain?

660
00:30:24,454 --> 00:30:26,979
What, because of last night? No way.

661
00:30:27,057 --> 00:30:29,082
Reports have
been exaggerated.

662
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,651
Weddings make me
very emotional.

663
00:30:31,728 --> 00:30:34,219
I just have
that side to me.

664
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:36,759
Yeah, people say
you cry all the time.

665
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:38,961
Well,
that's not...

666
00:30:40,204 --> 00:30:42,536
Crotch injuries
are the worst.

667
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:44,267
You don't need
to tell me.

668
00:30:45,175 --> 00:30:46,540
I wasn't
telling you.

669
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,009
There's still
something there?

670
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:49,443
Excuse me?

671
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:52,238
They didn't
get torn off?

672
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:56,280
No, they didn't... Nothing got
torn off. Who told you that?

673
00:30:57,487 --> 00:30:59,717
I may have told
some people that.

674
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,985
I'm nervous. I'm about to get married.

675
00:31:03,126 --> 00:31:05,219
If you want
to sit on this.

676
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:09,525
I was thinking the wood might be
too hard on your damaged penis.

677
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,067
Make it softer.

678
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:18,199
It's my scrotum,
and it was.

679
00:31:18,275 --> 00:31:20,038
Thank you.
Sure.

680
00:31:26,516 --> 00:31:27,608
Oh. Here we go.

681
00:31:27,684 --> 00:31:31,051
They asked for cash. But you
know, I give them cash every week.

682
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:33,646
So, how much cash
does a person need?

683
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:37,660
I have taken it upon myself to do
something a little more special.

684
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:41,289
I have painted a portrait of
the two of them from memory.

685
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:49,004
And I have another one of them in
the nude. But that one is for me.

686
00:31:55,612 --> 00:31:59,639
I got them a set of turtle boiling
pots, shell hammer and bibs.

687
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:04,988
Is it zipping over your
belly? Don't squish the baby.

688
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:06,147
Thank you,
weirdo.

689
00:32:06,223 --> 00:32:09,488
Everybody see Kristy's
stupid blonde extensions?

690
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:11,686
It's like they were made
from a plastic broom.

691
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:13,423
Okay,
here I come.

692
00:32:13,864 --> 00:32:15,263
- Oh!
- Pam!

693
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:18,392
Darling,
you look beautiful.

694
00:32:18,468 --> 00:32:19,526
Thanks, Mom.

695
00:32:20,137 --> 00:32:21,502
I hope
he deserves you.

696
00:32:21,571 --> 00:32:22,629
He does.

697
00:32:22,706 --> 00:32:26,472
Are you sure? Remember, you
don't have to do this. You don't.

698
00:32:26,543 --> 00:32:28,807
Mom, you're totally
projecting and being a drag.

699
00:32:28,879 --> 00:32:30,278
Yes, thank you, Mom.

700
00:32:30,347 --> 00:32:33,009
Hey, I'm going to go outside
and talk to Dwight.

701
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:36,052
Okay, great. Yeah, I'll
see you in a second.

702
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,177
Wait. What?

703
00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:40,351
Oh, no.

704
00:32:46,563 --> 00:32:47,552
Hey.

705
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:48,825
Can you come here, please?

706
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:50,491
Is this allowed?

707
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:53,468
No, no. But I'm
allowing it. Just come here.

708
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:57,063
That was
an intelligent comment.

709
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,404
Hello, stranger.
How do I look?

710
00:32:59,676 --> 00:33:02,941
Oh! Fine. Isabel?
Nice to see you.

711
00:33:04,614 --> 00:33:06,275
What do you want?

712
00:33:07,951 --> 00:33:10,317
Nothing. Anymore.

713
00:33:11,154 --> 00:33:12,678
So, tell me again

714
00:33:12,756 --> 00:33:16,248
the difference between
Filene's and Filene's Basement.

715
00:33:17,327 --> 00:33:20,262
Hey, hey. He's not
sitting with me, either.

716
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:23,661
Where are you sitting?
Do you need a seat buddy?

717
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:24,996
I'm standing.
I'm a bridesmaid.

718
00:33:25,068 --> 00:33:27,502
Oh. I wish
I was a bridesmaid.

719
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:30,262
Where am I gonna go?

720
00:33:30,874 --> 00:33:31,932
Hey.

721
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:34,571
Wow.

722
00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:38,347
You look...
Terrible.

723
00:33:38,648 --> 00:33:40,172
...so beautiful.

724
00:33:41,818 --> 00:33:42,978
Hey.

725
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:46,283
My veil tore.

726
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:51,651
I knew when we were getting married
and I'm five months pregnant,

727
00:33:51,728 --> 00:33:54,925
that I'm not going to be able to
wear the dress that I always wanted,

728
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:56,727
or high heels.

729
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,769
Hey, you look just
as I imagined you.

730
00:34:01,004 --> 00:34:02,471
Pam, you're
so pretty.

731
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:06,131
Thank you.

732
00:34:07,077 --> 00:34:10,638
And who cares? It's
a stupid veil, right?

733
00:34:11,548 --> 00:34:13,641
No, this is the one thing I was supposed

734
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:16,208
to be able to control,
was this veil.

735
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:19,616
There.
Now we're even.

736
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:37,733
Everyone's driving me crazy.

737
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:41,608
I know way too much
about Andy's scrotum.

738
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,840
And my mom won't
stop freaking out

739
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:46,212
about my dad's
new girlfriend.

740
00:34:48,218 --> 00:34:51,346
This is supposed to
be our wedding day.

741
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:53,889
Why did we invite
all these people?

742
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:12,641
I think Pam ran away
because she knew deep down

743
00:35:12,709 --> 00:35:14,404
she wouldn't be
a good wife.

744
00:35:14,478 --> 00:35:15,467
Yes.

745
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:18,274
What are you doing?

746
00:35:18,348 --> 00:35:20,475
I'm trying to decide
if I have time to pee.

747
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,608
How long do you
take to pee?

748
00:35:21,685 --> 00:35:23,710
The peeing is fast, Oscar.

749
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:25,948
It's getting my tie back on.

750
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:33,089
Hey. Hi. Would you have
a snack in your purse?

751
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:36,258
You're a mom, I just
figured you might have one.

752
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,357
Yeah.

753
00:35:37,434 --> 00:35:39,129
Oh! Ooh! Apricot.

754
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:42,533
Do you have any of the Very
Berry or Ocean Splash, or...

755
00:35:42,606 --> 00:35:43,800
No.

756
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:45,705
Okay. Were you saving it?

757
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:48,543
No, no. That's okay. I've just...

758
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:52,681
I've had a very
rough weekend.

759
00:35:52,749 --> 00:35:54,410
Oh, I'm sorry.

760
00:35:57,521 --> 00:35:59,614
Apricot.
Made of real apes.

761
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:02,782
Do you think they
canceled the wedding?

762
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:05,327
Relax, you'll get
your shot at Jim.

763
00:36:05,395 --> 00:36:08,990
Those two treat the whole
office like a 1970s key party.

764
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,529
My weekend
was bad so far.

765
00:36:12,602 --> 00:36:13,626
Oh!

766
00:36:14,204 --> 00:36:16,172
I came here hoping
to meet somebody,

767
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,469
you know,
as you do at weddings.

768
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:23,170
End up going to sleep
by the vending machine.

769
00:36:24,114 --> 00:36:25,240
It was loud,
but it was warm.

770
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:26,577
That sounds awful.

771
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:30,814
And the love of my life
is dating somebody else.

772
00:36:31,221 --> 00:36:32,518
Just...

773
00:36:33,456 --> 00:36:35,356
It is a terrible year
for love.

774
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:37,950
Yeah, I guess it is.

775
00:36:38,595 --> 00:36:41,223
Thinking about
having my sperm frozen.

776
00:36:42,832 --> 00:36:44,390
Excuse me,
you Michael Scott?

777
00:36:44,467 --> 00:36:45,525
Yeah.

778
00:36:45,602 --> 00:36:47,763
Heard you might have
a whoopee cushion on you.

779
00:36:47,837 --> 00:36:49,702
Our sister's in the can and
we totally want to get her

780
00:36:49,773 --> 00:36:50,797
when she comes back.

781
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:51,898
Oh...

782
00:36:51,975 --> 00:36:55,502
Wow. That sounds
hilarious. I do, actually.

783
00:36:55,612 --> 00:36:56,909
There you go,
use it in good health.

784
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,447
Yes.

785
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:02,350
Wait a minute. What is the
etiquette on taking the gifts?

786
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:03,647
Can you only
take your own back?

787
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,154
Or is it a
whatever-you-can-carry thing?

788
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:09,249
Anyone have anything they
want to trade for a toaster?

789
00:37:09,326 --> 00:37:11,191
Does it have
slots for hot dogs?

790
00:37:11,261 --> 00:37:12,455
No.

791
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:13,928
Who would want it?

792
00:37:13,997 --> 00:37:16,363
Guys, maybe we should
wait a little more time

793
00:37:16,433 --> 00:37:17,923
before we start
grabbing boxes.

794
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:20,396
Toby.

795
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,528
Dwight.

796
00:37:21,605 --> 00:37:23,402
I'd like to lodge a formal
complaint against Jim

797
00:37:23,473 --> 00:37:25,407
for making us wait
for over an hour.

798
00:37:25,475 --> 00:37:28,444
God. Crap!

799
00:37:34,017 --> 00:37:37,282
Come here, you.
Get in there.

800
00:37:38,154 --> 00:37:41,180
Well, I guess this wedding
is not going to happen.

801
00:37:41,258 --> 00:37:42,589
I wonder if this
is it for them?

802
00:37:46,696 --> 00:37:48,391
Hey, what happened?
Where were you guys?

803
00:37:48,465 --> 00:37:50,023
Do you know how long
I've been waiting here?

804
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,965
Well, we are here now,
so let's go.

805
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:53,263
Yes! Yes!

806
00:37:54,504 --> 00:37:59,498
I have so much joy in my
heart right now. How do I look?

807
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:00,565
You look great.

808
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:01,975
You look great.

809
00:38:04,881 --> 00:38:06,576
Wear a tie much?

810
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:36,968
Oh, boy.

811
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:43,679
I begged them not to.

812
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:44,777
Mmm-hmm.

813
00:38:44,854 --> 00:38:47,152
I know you specifically put this
song on your do-not-play list.

814
00:38:47,223 --> 00:38:48,212
Yes, I did.

815
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:49,280
I'm sorry.

816
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,990
Go ahead,
I think it's your turn.

817
00:38:53,063 --> 00:38:54,690
Wait, what happened?
You're okay with this?

818
00:38:54,764 --> 00:38:56,425
Yeah, I'm okay.

819
00:38:56,499 --> 00:38:57,659
Okay, then.

820
00:38:59,035 --> 00:39:01,595
Hey, Pam? Did you see
this? It was on YouTube.

821
00:39:01,671 --> 00:39:02,899
Saw it.

822
00:41:40,163 --> 00:41:43,997
I bought those boat tickets the
day I saw that YouTube video.

823
00:41:44,601 --> 00:41:45,932
I knew we'd
need a backup plan.

824
00:41:46,002 --> 00:41:49,597
The boat was actually plan C.
The church was plan B.

825
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:54,234
And plan A was marrying
her a long, long time ago.

826
00:41:55,678 --> 00:41:57,543
Pretty much
the day I met her.

827
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:12,420
What an awesome party! The
best wedding I've ever been to.

828
00:42:12,495 --> 00:42:14,486
I got six numbers.

829
00:42:14,564 --> 00:42:17,965
One more would have been
a complete telephone number.

830
00:42:19,502 --> 00:42:21,129
This was epic.

831
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:25,535
My Kleenex shoes were a
huge conversation piece.

832
00:42:25,608 --> 00:42:29,237
But, man,
my dogs are barking.

833
00:42:34,684 --> 00:42:35,742
Ooh!

834
00:42:36,486 --> 00:42:39,785
My feet were so sweaty,
I can't even feel the cold.

835
00:42:41,491 --> 00:42:43,254
What a lovely hotel.

836
00:42:43,526 --> 00:42:44,515
Okay.
