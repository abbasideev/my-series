1
00:00:02,368 --> 00:00:04,666
Oh, yeah! I've got a big box, yes I do!

2
00:00:04,737 --> 00:00:06,534
I've got a big box,
how about you?

3
00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:09,870
I've got a big box, yes I do,
I've got a big box, how about you?

4
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:11,239
I think you don't know
what you're saying.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,179
It is "from Sah-bray," our new
owner, and it is "to Sah-bray." Us!

6
00:00:16,882 --> 00:00:19,373
I wonder what's inside.
Scissor me.

7
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:26,490
Dunder Mifflin was
recently bought

8
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:29,550
by an electronics
company named Sah-bray.

9
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:33,462
They stepped in at the eleventh
hour and they saved our asses.

10
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:36,830
Although David Wallace said
that we were the one branch

11
00:00:36,902 --> 00:00:38,699
that was actually
working right,

12
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:41,069
so we probably could've
saved our own asses.

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,165
We didn't need them
touching our asses.

14
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:46,776
Wow!

15
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:48,240
Awesome.

16
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,344
For Accounting,
a brand new printer,

17
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:56,911
and for the sales staff,
a new fax machine.

18
00:00:57,423 --> 00:01:00,153
This cord has
Creed written all over it.

19
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:05,523
And whoever would like
a brand new scanner

20
00:01:05,764 --> 00:01:08,130
can come visit it
in my office. Thank you.

21
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:09,632
Here we go.

22
00:01:13,338 --> 00:01:14,999
Cool. What next?

23
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:16,666
Guys, um, who's Gabe?

24
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:18,733
This note says to
put the box aside

25
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:21,837
for a Gabe Lewis,
who's coming tomorrow.

26
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:27,446
Okay, everybody, listen up.
I have some bad news.

27
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:29,818
Due to circumstances
beyond my control...

28
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:31,378
Impulsivity and
inattention to detail...

29
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:33,220
Hey, hey.

30
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:36,187
I have opened a box which
should not have been opened...

31
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:38,126
Terrible mistake.
...and distributed things

32
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:39,494
which should not
have been distributed.

33
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:40,623
Un-distributable.

34
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:43,031
Well, maybe we can
put the box back together.

35
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,933
Impossible.
He opened it like an ape.

36
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,894
I think we can do it.

37
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:50,873
Yeah, yeah.

38
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:56,311
Did we try printer first,
shredder at an angle?

39
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:58,315
Yeah. Fax cable, then
the scanner upside-down?

40
00:01:58,383 --> 00:01:59,372
Yes.

41
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:01,510
Have you tried
making everything smaller?

42
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,950
And...

43
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:10,184
Wow! Really nice job!

44
00:02:10,262 --> 00:02:13,527
This group of people, when
they put their minds together,

45
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,124
they can do
something great.

46
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:19,398
And I think that you should
all be proud of yourselves.

47
00:02:21,373 --> 00:02:22,772
Oh, Michael!

48
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:25,674
All right, relax. We can
do it. We just did it.

49
00:02:25,744 --> 00:02:28,508
So, we can do this again.
Erin, scissor me, please?

50
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,569
No, don't!

51
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:31,115
Thank you. Oh!
Got it. Okay.

52
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,231
All right, he's on his
way up. Okay, we ready?

53
00:02:57,676 --> 00:02:59,143
What do you want us to do?

54
00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:00,610
Why do I have to
explain everything?

55
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:02,738
Because we're usually
not on the same page.

56
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:11,352
Oh. Okay.

57
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:14,023
And to you.

58
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:17,484
Gabe seems tall.
Hope we get along.

59
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:19,659
I had a very good thing going
with David Wallace.

60
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:22,427
He was a good guy. He was
somebody I could trust.

61
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:24,264
There he is.
You can really see

62
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:26,930
that he is okay
taking a picture with me,

63
00:03:27,372 --> 00:03:30,535
even though I was there
for disciplinary reasons.

64
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:34,444
Welcome. Scranton hotdog from Scranton?

65
00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:36,481
You know what, Dwight? Let's
give him a minute to settle in.

66
00:03:36,548 --> 00:03:38,140
Shall we?
Okay.

67
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:41,484
Hi. My name
is Gabe Lewis.

68
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:43,987
I am Coordinating Director
for Emerging Regions.

69
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:47,389
Hello, Gabe. I am
Michael Scott, co-manager.

70
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,950
This is my protégé,
Jim Halpert.

71
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:51,953
Co-manager, actually.

72
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,019
In training.

73
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:55,566
Trained. Loving it.
Good at it, so...

74
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:58,102
We are very impressed
with this branch,

75
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,570
and we are so excited
about this merger.

76
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,866
We're very excited,
too, aren't we, guys?

77
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:04,499
Right?
- So excited.

78
00:04:04,576 --> 00:04:07,409
We have a little song
prepared for you.

79
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,804
Actually,
if you don't mind,

80
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:12,213
I would love to put this
on the Sabre website.

81
00:04:12,284 --> 00:04:13,444
Sabre.

82
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:15,646
Sabre. Sabre.
It's Sabre.

83
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:17,484
It's Sabre.
Oh. Of course.

84
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:18,545
Sabre.

85
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:19,955
Good.
Take it away, guys.

86
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:21,751
Okay.

87
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:30,026
Hopped off
the train in Scranton, PA

88
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:32,536
Another cloudy gray afternoon

89
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:35,803
Jumped in the cab Here
you are for the first time

90
00:04:35,874 --> 00:04:38,365
Look to the right And you
see the Electric City sign

91
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:42,777
This is gonna be a good day
For Dunder Mifflin and Sah-bray

92
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,779
Sabre.
It's Sabre.

93
00:04:47,886 --> 00:04:49,877
Dunder Mifflin and Sabre

94
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:55,188
So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Dunder
Mifflin is a part of Sah-bray

95
00:04:55,694 --> 00:05:00,495
So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sabre

96
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:02,260
Dunder Mifflin
is a part of Sabre

97
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:03,729
You sure it's Sabre?

98
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:07,096
Hey.
Thank you.

99
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:10,366
Hey, we should be fine
if we leave around 11:20.

100
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:14,640
Oh, you MapQuested it.
It's four blocks away.

101
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:15,839
Well, now we
won't get lost.

102
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:19,740
Or we could drive,
and that takes one minute.

103
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:23,313
We found a great
local daycare.

104
00:05:23,388 --> 00:05:26,380
It's rated really high by all
the local parenting websites,

105
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,619
but that means it's also
really hard to get into.

106
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:31,891
Turns out a lot of parents want
the very best for their children.

107
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:32,987
That's weird.

108
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:35,590
We're hoping our interview
seals the deal.

109
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:38,259
But if not,
there's always the Army.

110
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,805
The infantry.

111
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,568
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

112
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:49,839
So you've just
been bought by Sabre.

113
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:51,883
You've probably got
a lot of questions.

114
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,647
Hi, I'm Christian Slater.
What's it like to work for Sabre?

115
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:58,423
Let's find out together.

116
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,888
Working at Sabre means
taking on the challenge

117
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,484
of the road that
rises to meet you.

118
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:11,025
Sabre is respecting the past, but
opening the window to the future.

119
00:06:13,004 --> 00:06:17,839
Have you ever tasted a
rainbow? At Sabre, you will.

120
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:24,907
You'll find it easy to embrace
the Sabre spirit. Welcome.

121
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:28,180
We're very excited to go
on this journey with you.

122
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,750
So, you've been shown
a nonsensical video.

123
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:35,315
You're probably wondering, "What's
going on?" Well, you're not alone.

124
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:39,129
Wow. Really terrific.

125
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:42,298
Most of our business comes
from selling printers,

126
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:45,302
so don't think of yourselves
as paper salesmen anymore,

127
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,861
but as printer salesmen
who also sell paper.

128
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:49,665
Perfect.

129
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:51,809
No. Don't like that.

130
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:55,769
At Sabre, we really encourage
honest communication.

131
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:58,446
You should always feel free
to express your thoughts...

132
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:01,247
Talk about vacation days!

133
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:03,445
We have a policy
here at Sabre

134
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:05,649
where we are allowed
to take two weeks.

135
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:08,124
But I banked six weeks.

136
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:10,058
I already booked
a Great Lakes cruise.

137
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:11,925
Hey, who the hell's
going through our stuff?

138
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:15,023
Actually, that's Nick.
He's your new IT guy.

139
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:17,057
He's setting up
a site blocker,

140
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:19,262
mostly blocking
the inappropriate sites,

141
00:07:19,337 --> 00:07:22,773
and then there are the time-wasting
sites like Twitter, YouTube.

142
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:24,399
We are blocking
those as well.

143
00:07:25,076 --> 00:07:26,839
No. Don't like that.

144
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:29,138
Okay, did everyone get one?

145
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:33,544
With these bottles, we eliminate
the need for plastic water bottles,

146
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:36,644
which are the scourge
of the environment.

147
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:39,856
We will still get to use the
little cups, though, right?

148
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:42,018
Little cups?
Like paper or plastic?

149
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:43,424
I don't know what
they're made of.

150
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:46,589
They're two-ounce paper cups dipped
in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.

151
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:48,326
Okay. Well,
I bet you could fit

152
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,368
20 little cups of water
in your aluminum bottle.

153
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:52,198
You know what
can't fit in a bottle

154
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,204
are the 20 little trips
I take to the cooler,

155
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:56,172
and the 20 little scans
I do of everybody

156
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:57,708
to make sure everything's
running smoothly,

157
00:07:57,776 --> 00:08:00,802
and the 20 little conversations
that I have with Stanley.

158
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,937
That's okay.

159
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:04,243
There is a small part
of me that is actually

160
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:06,876
very excited about
this new company.

161
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:12,882
But 70% of me is water, and
the other part, the real part,

162
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,290
the part that has
feelings and emotions

163
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,828
and thoughts and
makes decisions,

164
00:08:18,296 --> 00:08:20,560
and, if I can be crass,
makes babies,

165
00:08:20,632 --> 00:08:25,695
that part thinks that
all of these changes suck...

166
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:32,537
Really?

167
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:36,676
You don't have enough water
in there? Your stomach?

168
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:42,618
What?

169
00:08:42,687 --> 00:08:43,847
Looks like we kicked it.

170
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:47,725
I miss the old
Dunder Mifflin.

171
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:52,219
Too much change is not a
good thing. Ask the climate.

172
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:56,191
I don't want to
appear ungrateful

173
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:57,895
for everything
Sabre is doing for us.

174
00:08:57,969 --> 00:09:00,437
I don't get that sense
at all from you, so...

175
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:01,767
Well, you should
have a little,

176
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,569
but it's great
that you don't,

177
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:07,942
because I am trying to
embrace all of these changes.

178
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:10,675
But I'm... I'll be honest,
I'm having trouble

179
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:12,239
wrapping my head
around a couple of them.

180
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:13,614
Which ones?

181
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:15,050
All of them.

182
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:17,851
Well, I wish that
I could do something,

183
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:20,118
but it's kind of policy,
you know?

184
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:21,351
Above my pay grade.

185
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:25,328
So, maybe we should call.
We should call someone.

186
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:29,333
I could help. I'm good with
bosses. Call one of the higher ups?

187
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:31,959
You know what?
Let me see what I can do.

188
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,301
Okay, this is officially the
cutest thing I've ever seen.

189
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:43,906
Cubbies! I totally
forgot about cubbies.

190
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:47,542
There's a finger-painting
station and a curly slide.

191
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:49,587
Am I too old to go here?

192
00:09:55,393 --> 00:09:56,451
Oh!

193
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:00,989
Adorable, right?

194
00:10:06,137 --> 00:10:08,264
I walked in on someone
in the bathroom. What?

195
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,830
I just walked in on
someone in the bathroom.

196
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:10,932
Who?
I don't know.

197
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,636
The guy we're meeting with?
I don't know.

198
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:14,679
I don't know,
I don't know.

199
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:17,507
I am telling you, there
are no strawberries in here.

200
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:19,049
Well, I saw them in there.

201
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:22,484
Well, maybe they ran away
'cause the pizza was, like,

202
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:25,389
"Hey, get out
of here, you stupid strawberries."

203
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:28,456
I think when Andy
finally asks me out,

204
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:31,359
he's gonna try to top what
he did with the drum line.

205
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,363
I can't wait to see
what he comes up with.

206
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:35,797
The ball is totally
in Erin's court,

207
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:37,664
after the whole
drum line thing.

208
00:10:38,903 --> 00:10:41,667
First let me say, I told them
everything that you wanted me to say

209
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,799
in just the way you
wanted me to say it, so...

210
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,934
Gabe, honey, I love this, I
love the sound of your voice,

211
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:48,707
but I really need
some new information now.

212
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,681
Okay. I told the story
of your uncle,

213
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,809
and I have a feeling
that you would've really,

214
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:57,213
really been proud
of the way... Okay.

215
00:10:57,956 --> 00:11:00,322
Wait a minute, who is
it? Who's there? What?

216
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:01,950
Is there somebody
in the room with you?

217
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:04,894
I want to see who it is.
Turn me around.

218
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:06,624
I don't. It's just...

219
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:09,166
Turn me around. Now.

220
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:13,366
Hey, buddy?
Was it something I said?

221
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:17,431
Hello. No. My name's
Michael Scott. Hello.

222
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:19,841
Well, hello, Mr. Scott,
pleased to meet you.

223
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:23,972
Nice to meet you. We are very
excited about the merger with Sabre.

224
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:25,878
I think you have
a great accent.

225
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,750
Thank you. I've been working
on it since I was a little girl.

226
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:33,052
To what do I owe the pleasure
of this video chat?

227
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:38,226
Well, I am a little concerned about
all these changes, to be quite frank.

228
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,393
I think we have done things a
certain way here at Dunder Mifflin

229
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:43,832
for quite some time.

230
00:11:44,102 --> 00:11:45,831
Pardon.
Pardon me, Mr. Scott,

231
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:47,838
but the last time
I saw a company

232
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:49,806
as mismanaged
as Dunder Mifflin

233
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:52,138
was my grandson's
snowball company,

234
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,508
so you'll excuse me
if I'd prefer

235
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:56,638
that you all adapt to
the way we do things.

236
00:11:57,315 --> 00:12:01,945
Okay. I feel very strongly
that you can't just come in here

237
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:05,982
and change everything that
people have been doing forever.

238
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:12,630
Is Christian Slater back
there? Because he knows...

239
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:15,262
He'd know what to do.

240
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:19,395
So listen,
why don't you tell Gabe

241
00:12:20,472 --> 00:12:23,805
if by the end of the day
you can't handle the changes?

242
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,436
I've already told him, but I will tell
him again, if you think that'll help.

243
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:30,811
I would take until the end
of the day if I were you.

244
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:58,837
Pam and Jim?
Hey. I'm Jerry.

245
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,968
Hi, Jerry.

246
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:01,033
Jerry.

247
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:02,579
Good to see you.
Come on in.

248
00:13:02,814 --> 00:13:05,009
My office is
right back here.

249
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,074
This is the playroom.

250
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:08,642
This is great.

251
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:10,682
Gotta confess,
we came a little early,

252
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:12,382
so we got a quick
look around, but...

253
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:13,549
So you saw it already.

254
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,320
No. Yes, we saw this, yes.

255
00:13:15,393 --> 00:13:17,258
No, it wasn't like
a look around,

256
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:19,125
we really just had a peek. Quick peek.

257
00:13:19,197 --> 00:13:20,960
Didn't focus on anything
in particular. It's lovely.

258
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:24,868
Gotta take this, sorry.
- Do it.

259
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:25,960
Hi, this is Jerry.

260
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:27,026
Okay, you've gotta
pull it together.

261
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:28,572
We should just go.
He's really uncomfortable.

262
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,335
He's uncomfortable
because you're acting weird,

263
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:31,500
so you have to
stop acting weird.

264
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:33,771
What if we just bring it up?
We'll just put it out in the open?

265
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:36,507
That's the weirdest possible
solution to the problem.

266
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:38,208
Sorry about that.
Right this way.

267
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:39,580
All right.

268
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:47,519
I have come here today
to talk to Mr. David Wallace

269
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:50,893
about this whole thing
going on with Sabre.

270
00:13:50,962 --> 00:13:52,623
He will know
exactly what to do.

271
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:55,759
He is not a big fan of me
dropping by unannounced,

272
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,734
but then again, who is?

273
00:13:58,403 --> 00:13:59,768
Hey. Hi.
Michael!

274
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,807
Sorry, I hope you're
not busy doing something.

275
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:04,865
No, you kidding? Come on
in. Come on in. You sure?

276
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:06,570
You look great.
You look great, too.

277
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:07,736
You hungry?
I'm just having lunch.

278
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:09,609
Oh, yeah,
that sounds good.

279
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:12,013
Teddy, look who
just stopped in.

280
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:13,844
Hey.
- Hey.

281
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:17,445
Hey! Wow. That's very
loud. Keep it up, son!

282
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,219
Wow. Oh, yummy!

283
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:26,024
You have got the life, my friend. Yeah.

284
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:28,497
Can I just stay here
and never go back?

285
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:30,466
Things not going
so well over there?

286
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:32,730
Oh, man!
How much time do you have?

287
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:36,137
I have a doctor's appointment
next Thursday.

288
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:37,533
Yeah?

289
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:43,174
Hey, honey, how's your day
going? Did you do anything cool?

290
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:46,512
No, sweetie,
I just hung out.

291
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:48,680
'Cause I saw
you had shoes on,

292
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:50,414
so I didn't know
if you did anything.

293
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:53,582
No, just hanging out, hon.
You remember Michael?

294
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:56,285
Hi. Sorry, I was just
in the neighborhood

295
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:58,761
and thought
I'd come by and say...

296
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,730
No problem at all.
This is great.

297
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:02,663
So, what are
you guys up to?

298
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:07,503
I don't know. Maybe...

299
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:09,802
Actually, you know, I think
maybe we'll go outside.

300
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:15,242
Maybe... We'll go outside? Go outside.

301
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:21,885
There was one thing
we were curious about.

302
00:15:21,953 --> 00:15:24,979
Your flexibility on things
like Easter or Memorial Day,

303
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:27,354
because we might want to change
our days around a little bit.

304
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:29,450
That seems a bit premature,
don't you think?

305
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:31,154
I don't even know if I
have a space for you yet,

306
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:33,595
and you're already lining up
your holiday plans.

307
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:39,069
No, sorry, we're kind of planners,
but we're also flexible, too,

308
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:40,126
so you know what?

309
00:15:40,204 --> 00:15:41,603
Maybe we can just discuss it
when the time comes.

310
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:44,574
Yeah. If the time comes,
we can discuss it.

311
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:49,135
Is this because Jim walked in
on you going to the bathroom?

312
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:50,305
What?

313
00:15:53,351 --> 00:15:55,319
Seriously? You told her?

314
00:15:56,854 --> 00:15:58,321
Did it...
It might have come up

315
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:59,981
while we were
waiting for you.

316
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:01,923
And you thought that
might have something

317
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:03,551
to do with how
the meeting is going?

318
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:05,255
No, I didn't... Maybe,
because it doesn't seem

319
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,264
to be going super well.

320
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:09,695
You didn't consider the fact that
it might not be going super well

321
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:12,759
just because it might
not be going super well?

322
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:15,730
No, 'cause we're
really nice people,

323
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:17,798
but you don't
seem to like us.

324
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:20,404
I'm being
perfectly pleasant.

325
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:22,176
Did you ever consider
that you might not be

326
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:24,407
as charming as
you think you are?

327
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:28,213
This coming from the guy who
still uses a children's toilet.

328
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:33,649
Why didn't you just
lock the door, man?

329
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:36,626
It doesn't lock for
the children's safety.

330
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:38,889
Anybody could have walked in.

331
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:42,192
It was story time.

332
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:49,833
Sabre is changing everything. Site
blockers, they don't let us use cups.

333
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:51,935
So I started thinking,
who could handle this?

334
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,773
Who would know what to do?

335
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:55,904
David Wallace
would know what to do.

336
00:16:56,981 --> 00:16:58,846
What should I do,
David Wallace?

337
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,543
I don't know.
What can you do?

338
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:03,485
Mmm! Exactly.
What are you thinking?

339
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:05,845
It's a tough one.

340
00:17:05,923 --> 00:17:07,151
It is a tough one.

341
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:08,522
I don't have
any ideas for you.

342
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:11,255
Yeah,
but one would be good.

343
00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:13,923
Hey, okay, wait.

344
00:17:13,998 --> 00:17:15,022
Okay.

345
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,226
I want to tell you about
a business idea I have.

346
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:18,325
Okay.
Okay.

347
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:21,497
You know how kids leave
their toys everywhere? Right?

348
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:24,871
So this is a vacuum. It's
like a Shop-Vac type of thing.

349
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,646
Teaches kids how to pick up
their own toys. Right?

350
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:32,339
Baseball gloves,
Hacky Sacks,

351
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:35,818
drumsticks...
Picks it up.

352
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:37,316
So the kid's making
the noise to pick it up?

353
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:38,912
Yeah. No.

354
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,958
No, no,
that's the vacuum noise.

355
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:42,083
Okay.

356
00:17:42,627 --> 00:17:43,821
You don't like it.

357
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:44,919
No, I think it's...

358
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:46,258
No, it's okay.

359
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,298
Another guy from Dunder
Mifflin, Arnie from Research,

360
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:51,802
he's gonna draw up
the prototype, and...

361
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:55,734
It's like a Shop-Vac.
Did I say that?

362
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:56,933
Yep.

363
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:00,567
It'll be okay.

364
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:05,114
Hey, any fun
weekend plans?

365
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,673
No. You?

366
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:09,219
No, actually.

367
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:13,848
So, nothing?

368
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:16,485
No movies or parties

369
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,552
or anything you might
want to invite someone to?

370
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,398
Nothing. It's wide open.

371
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,392
Okay.

372
00:18:24,068 --> 00:18:26,298
That's as hard
as I can hint.

373
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:30,399
Hey, you know, if you want, I'm
sure I could get Arnie on board,

374
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:32,966
if you want to join us
for Suck it.

375
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:35,071
Work together again.

376
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:36,238
The what?

377
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:38,278
"Suck it."
That's what it's called.

378
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:39,577
Oh! Okay.

379
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,844
Huh? Catchy.

380
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:42,476
Kid's will love it.
I like it.

381
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:43,850
There are very few things
that would make me

382
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:46,082
not want to team up
with David Wallace,

383
00:18:46,157 --> 00:18:48,250
and Suck It
is one of them.

384
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:51,588
See you later.
Oh, Michael.

385
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:52,686
I know.

386
00:18:52,763 --> 00:18:53,787
Thank you for coming.

387
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:55,423
Thanks for having me.

388
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,765
Well, that's not the David
Wallace that I remember.

389
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,239
That was some sort
of weird creature

390
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:07,701
that lives in
David Wallace's house.

391
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:13,550
Oh, my God. All right!
Just get me out of here.

392
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:20,750
Hello! Is anybody home?

393
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:24,085
Thank you, Erin.

394
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:29,028
Now, if everyone would
please ready their canteens

395
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:30,727
so I can fill them

396
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:33,861
with the sweet, sweet
nectar of Gabe's homeland

397
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:36,873
and then propose a toast.
Here we go.

398
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,872
You know when people
say getting fired

399
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:40,535
was the best thing that
ever happened to them?

400
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:42,135
I feel sorry
for those people.

401
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:44,579
That?
The best thing? Really?

402
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:49,742
Well, I'm not really one
for making speeches.

403
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:51,479
Yes, you are.
Since when?

404
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:52,614
You make a lot.

405
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,816
But I feel
pretty good right now.

406
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:57,452
I really do. A lot better than
I did earlier, let me tell you.

407
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:58,688
That's your toast?

408
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:00,321
No, this is my toast.

409
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:04,463
I think this whole thing
with Sabre is gonna work out.

410
00:20:04,535 --> 00:20:06,901
I have a very good
feeling about it.

411
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:09,405
Michael, this isn't a toast,
you're just thinking out loud.

412
00:20:09,473 --> 00:20:11,065
Here's my toast.

413
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:15,575
Orange juice is in here,

414
00:20:16,814 --> 00:20:20,079
and like Sabre, it is from
Florida, and it is good.

415
00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:23,343
Just 'cause you have liquid,
that doesn't make it a toast.

416
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:26,447
Here's the toast.
I'm gonna do it now.

417
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:32,760
Raise your container
to us and to Sabre.

418
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:36,230
To us and to Sabre. Hear, hear.

419
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,562
Mmm.

420
00:20:37,635 --> 00:20:42,072
Wow, that is metallicy.
That's like drinking a battery.

421
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:49,506
Really gets you in the fillings,
doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.

422
00:20:57,488 --> 00:20:59,718
Well, it's a mess,
what a mess

423
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:02,218
What you gonna do

424
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:06,627
You're gonna take out your Suck
It And you'll suck it, suck it

425
00:21:07,198 --> 00:21:09,723
Take out your Suck It
and you'll suck it

426
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,994
Suck it
Yeah

427
00:21:11,068 --> 00:21:12,262
Suck it
Yeah

428
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:13,598
Suck it
Yeah

429
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:15,434
Take out my Suck It and we'll Suck it

430
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:16,939
Yeah
Suck it

431
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:19,476
Yeah. Take out my Suck It and
we'll suck it Take out, suck it

432
00:21:19,543 --> 00:21:20,669
Yeah

433
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:29,716
Teddy!
