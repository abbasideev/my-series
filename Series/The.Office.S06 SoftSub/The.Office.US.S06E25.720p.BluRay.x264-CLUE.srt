1
00:00:02,067 --> 00:00:04,535
This here is
a radon test kit.

2
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:06,070
Okay, I'll be
putting them everywhere.

3
00:00:06,138 --> 00:00:08,698
And please don't
throw these out.

4
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:11,767
This is a radon test kit.

5
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:13,971
Please don't
throw these out.

6
00:00:15,714 --> 00:00:17,011
You'll see them
all over the office.

7
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:19,409
Toby has been leaving
radon kits everywhere

8
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:21,409
like he owns the place.

9
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:25,921
The first time I threw mine away,
I thought it was an ant trap.

10
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,350
But I figured I'd
rather live with ants

11
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:30,327
than with this
creepy little disk.

12
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:34,298
The second time, I thought
it was one of those,

13
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:38,302
you know, the things you turn
over and it moos like a cow thing,

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,967
but upon closer examination it was
another ant trap, so I threw it away.

15
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:48,776
And the third time,
I did it out of spite.

16
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:53,112
Come on, Michael,
you're interrupting.

17
00:00:53,185 --> 00:00:54,914
You're kidding me! God!

18
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:57,046
You say radon is silent but
deadly and then you expect me

19
00:00:57,122 --> 00:00:59,147
not to make farting noises
with my mouth?

20
00:00:59,224 --> 00:01:00,486
What is this?
Please sit down.

21
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,049
You know what, we're
not gonna die of radon,

22
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:03,389
we're gonna die of boredom.

23
00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:04,451
Yeah.

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,588
Right?

25
00:01:05,664 --> 00:01:07,757
And if I had a gun
with two bullets,

26
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,529
and I was in a room with
Hitler, Bin Laden and Toby,

27
00:01:10,602 --> 00:01:12,433
I would shoot Toby twice.

28
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:15,600
Okay, all right.
You were being really funny

29
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:16,663
and then you went too far.

30
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:18,642
I would kill Bin Laden
and then Toby.

31
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:20,267
No. That's still...

32
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:22,279
Okay, geniuses,
how would you do it?

33
00:01:22,347 --> 00:01:26,443
Curve the bullet like in my
favorite James McAvoy film Wanted.

34
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,610
All that does is help you
shoot around things.

35
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:30,484
What does Bin Laden... Is
there a curtain rod in the room?

36
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:31,580
I don't know.

37
00:01:31,657 --> 00:01:34,854
How about make-believe
land has anything you want?

38
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:36,986
Stanley, please,
this is serious.

39
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:39,991
Is this the thing where they use
an icicle so there's no evidence?

40
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:42,158
Yes, we should stab Toby
through the heart with an icicle.

41
00:01:42,234 --> 00:01:44,065
Come on, the whole two
bullet thing is a red herring.

42
00:01:44,136 --> 00:01:45,899
Here's how you do it.
You line them all up,

43
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:48,166
you take one bullet, shoot
them all through the throat

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,798
at the same time.

45
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,809
Watch this. Phyllis,
you're Hitler, come up here.

46
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:55,142
Toby, you're Toby. Andy,
you're Bin Laden. Line up.

47
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:56,738
- I don't want to do this.
- Throats together.

48
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:58,510
Toby, just do it!
Toby, come on.

49
00:01:58,584 --> 00:01:59,608
God.

50
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:01,676
Ready, one bullet and...

51
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,247
Boom!

52
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,087
Yeah, that works.

53
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:09,819
It worked!

54
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:33,644
What flavors did you get?

55
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,209
It's so exciting, Pam.

56
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:38,279
The Eagles are doing a theme of
ice creams in honor of turning 60.

57
00:02:38,357 --> 00:02:42,020
"Despera-Dough, Witchy-Womanilla."
Why do they do this?

58
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:43,186
Do you want me to
go back to the store?

59
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:45,822
No, no, no, it's fine.
I was just commenting.

60
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:48,065
We got to get these
out, open them up. Okay.

61
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:50,761
This is all for Michael. Turns
out his girlfriend was married.

62
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,031
Yeah, and when
Michael gets a broken heart,

63
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:54,538
this whole place
comes to a halt,

64
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:56,870
so, we're just trying to
get out in front of this.

65
00:02:57,142 --> 00:03:00,305
After his last breakup, he ate
40,000 calories in three hours.

66
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:02,347
Right, Pam?
That's what Pam told me.

67
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:04,073
Yeah.

68
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:05,776
Or, no, well,
I don't know.

69
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:08,479
I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece.

70
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:10,317
Otherwise I'd be
running this.

71
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:11,583
That's okay.

72
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:13,955
You probably shouldn't
keep a baby up that late.

73
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,484
We have Mr. Bean playing
in the conference room,

74
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:18,027
and the Pink Panther
movie in his office.

75
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:19,529
With half hour shifts
to watch with him.

76
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:21,429
And we need bodies in
both these rooms, people.

77
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,489
So, please sign up.

78
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:23,929
He's coming.
- Oh. Okay.

79
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:25,902
Everyone, remember
when he gets like this,

80
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:27,836
he will wallow
if you empathize.

81
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:29,168
Keep conversations light.

82
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:31,300
And if you get stuck and
you don't know what to do,

83
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:32,809
make a random
sound effect.

84
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,539
Okay, farting noise,
whatever. Okay.

85
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:36,905
Hey, everyone.
No, out.

86
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:38,210
Get out, right now.
Leave now.

87
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:39,580
Get out. Right now.

88
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:40,879
Please, please!

89
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,754
And if he makes a joke,
just laugh it up

90
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:45,551
no matter what, okay?

91
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:50,559
Morning, everyone.
- Hey!

92
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:51,687
Hey!

93
00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:52,787
Hey!

94
00:03:52,864 --> 00:03:53,990
Hello.

95
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:56,125
Michael,
nice tie or something.

96
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:58,562
Thank you.
It's reversible, I think.

97
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:01,802
That's hilarious. PAM: That's awesome.

98
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:02,965
You want some ice cream?

99
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,336
Oh! Wow. Are those
Eagles flavors?

100
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:08,845
"Cake It To The Limit,"
that's my favorite.

101
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:11,280
I love that. Too much
for me to have by myself.

102
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,647
Anybody want to share?

103
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:21,022
Okay, well... That's random.
I will dig into those later.

104
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:24,795
I don't follow this
exactly.

105
00:04:24,863 --> 00:04:26,421
"The descendents
of any replicants

106
00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:27,726
"from this union
shall have..."

107
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:28,823
Joint custody.
Joint custody.

108
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:32,232
Are we talking about
your grandchildren?

109
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:33,328
No.
No.

110
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:34,972
Rather than spend
all day in court,

111
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,100
we have decided to settle
our dispute using a mediator.

112
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:41,603
It was an option spelled out
in our child-rearing contract.

113
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,738
Alleged contract.

114
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:43,838
Alleged?

115
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:46,145
I'm going to own your farm
by the time this is over.

116
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:49,846
Pfft. Yeah, just try. I
will do legal jujitsu on you.

117
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:50,945
Yeah.

118
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,216
See, don't even need to make
contact. The law will do it.

119
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:58,053
So much of this is
just impossible to verify.

120
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,429
Item five, point B,
the beet juice cleanse.

121
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,367
I'm doing it. You know
I am. It's disgusting.

122
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:06,165
How do we know this? I'd
like to see a stool sample.

123
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:08,035
Dwight, look at my teeth.

124
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:10,165
Ugh!

125
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,002
No secret crying.

126
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,576
Hasn't even opened
the tissue box in there.

127
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:16,503
Could he still be seeing her?

128
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:18,172
I don't think he'd do that.

129
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,049
So, we're gonna say
the most likely scenario

130
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:22,052
is that Michael
matured overnight?

131
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,588
It happened to
Tom Hanks in Big.

132
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:27,519
Exactly.
It happened in Big.

133
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,688
No, I gotta go.
Text me later.

134
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:32,860
I'm really too tired
to do this. Me, too.

135
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:34,592
Then let's just not do this.

136
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,032
Do you have any idea
of the risks involved?

137
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,429
Hey, Michael.
Hey.

138
00:05:39,504 --> 00:05:41,972
We were wondering if you'd like
to have dinner with us tonight

139
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,974
in our home and
play with our baby?

140
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:45,634
We could order in
from Hooters.

141
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:47,209
Hooters to go, nice.

142
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:48,846
We can watch a movie
and play Rock Band.

143
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:50,006
Billy Joel Rock Band.

144
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:51,207
That exists?

145
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:52,341
Yes.

146
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:56,148
Okay, well, I'll have to take a
rain check, but thanks for the offer.

147
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:59,186
Michael Scott,
are you still seeing Donna?

148
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,818
Okay, Pam,

149
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:05,889
she's not invisible, so
stop asking silly questions.

150
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:07,056
Michael.

151
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:08,724
Since when is this an office

152
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,360
where we delve into
each other's personal lives?

153
00:06:11,436 --> 00:06:12,926
I like Donna.

154
00:06:14,806 --> 00:06:17,400
Is it wrong to
keep seeing her?

155
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:20,138
Depends on who you ask. I
mean, if you ask her husband

156
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:24,347
or you took a random poll,
yeah, it's wrong.

157
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:25,950
That is something
I would never do.

158
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:28,349
Well, I think we all know what
you're capable of, Meredith.

159
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,821
Hey, I have never cheated on, been
cheated on or been used to cheat with.

160
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:37,225
I ask everyone in the room,
"Are you in a relationship?"

161
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:40,024
People, this is Scranton

162
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:41,429
and many people
consider that to be

163
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,730
the Paris of
northeastern Pennsylvania.

164
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:46,669
And in Paris, it is rude for a
woman to have less than four lovers.

165
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:48,937
Ugh! Ryan, I do not want you
hanging out with Michael anymore.

166
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,132
Okay.

167
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,836
Okay, I will have you know
that I asked Donna about this

168
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:54,173
and she is fine with it.

169
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,874
And just to be sure, I asked
her again afterward, same answer.

170
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:58,244
How does he feel about it?

171
00:06:58,316 --> 00:07:00,113
He is never gonna find out.

172
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:01,880
He is a high school
baseball coach,

173
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:04,319
he wakes up early,
he goes to bed early.

174
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:07,991
Look at how long it took
for him to find out.

175
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:10,391
It was right under his nose.
I had to tell him.

176
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:11,929
Okay, now you're
just being hurtful.

177
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:13,294
I'm sorry.

178
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:16,592
Why is it okay for Stanley to
cheat? Or for Phyllis to cheat?

179
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:17,926
Hey.

180
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:19,061
On her diet.

181
00:07:19,337 --> 00:07:21,737
He's a sports guy.
He's scummy.

182
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:23,907
Dog fighting,
drugs, they spit.

183
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:25,508
Did Donna tell you that?

184
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:28,209
Real Sports with
Bryant Gumball.

185
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,714
So, you're just making a giant
assumption. You don't even know the guy.

186
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:32,147
You know what?
You know what?

187
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:35,243
I am declaring a moment
of silence right now.

188
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,118
Ten minutes of silence
honoring Michael Jackson.

189
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,057
Just sit there and think
about Michael Jackson.

190
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,085
My name's Andy Bernard
and I am a cuckold.

191
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:45,925
For those of you unfamiliar
with William Shakespeare,

192
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:48,488
a cuckold is a man whose
woman is cheating on him.

193
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:50,531
I've lived the part.

194
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,663
And let me tell you, I would so
much rather play the part on stage.

195
00:07:57,442 --> 00:08:00,843
So, here's the thing
about infidelity.

196
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:02,004
No, no.

197
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,571
When are you people going to
stop casting the first stone?

198
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:07,378
I am not in the wrong here.
I am the good guy.

199
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,350
How does that work?

200
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:13,424
Do you think this husband
is a super sweet, nice guy?

201
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:15,892
Do you think he's an angel?
I don't think so.

202
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:20,489
Why is his wife going off and having
a little something-something with me?

203
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:24,229
There has to be
a problem with him.

204
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:28,303
In any cheating movie, the person
getting cheated on is the hero.

205
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:30,800
You're Ali Larter,
I'm Beyoncé.

206
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:32,134
I am Beyoncé always.

207
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,939
Not this time.
Yes, I am.

208
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:37,037
This guy's a high school
baseball coach, right?

209
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:38,912
Let's go check him out, see
what a horrible person he is.

210
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,677
I would love that.
Yeah.

211
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:43,050
Those teams have games and practices
every day. Let's go check it out.

212
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:44,717
I have work to do.

213
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:46,416
Really?
I thought you were the boss.

214
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:49,282
Let's go.

215
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:53,397
I can't wait to see this jerk who
is making me cheat on his wife.

216
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:54,625
I should punch him
in the nose

217
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:56,030
for what he's
making me do to her.

218
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:06,374
All right, Andy, please.

219
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:07,842
Baseball!
Shh!

220
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,814
Try not to draw attention,
please.

221
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:13,341
That's him. That's him.

222
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:15,045
Where?
Right there.

223
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:16,311
The coach.

224
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:17,650
Stage right or stage left?

225
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:19,349
I played batboy
in Damn Yankees.

226
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:22,587
Right there. Look, look.
Follow my finger, okay? See?

227
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:24,589
The grownup by the base.

228
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:28,155
And now coaching third base
with two arms, two legs

229
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,394
and a heart capable
of feeling pain...

230
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:32,436
All right. Can you
just... Is number...

231
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:34,734
Can you just act normal
for a second, please?

232
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:37,070
Whatever.
I'm the one blending in.

233
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:47,847
Guys?
Pam?

234
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,944
Hey. Oh! Hi, Gabe.

235
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:53,349
Can you two please join
me in my office? Now.

236
00:09:58,563 --> 00:09:59,996
You were supposed
to be the lookout.

237
00:10:00,065 --> 00:10:03,034
Yeah, well, it's really warm in
here. It's like a sleeping bag.

238
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:05,926
I don't want to be the heavy
here, but honestly, guys,

239
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:07,471
this makes us all look bad.

240
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:09,673
Sorry about that.
So embarrassing.

241
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:14,202
Good, okay,
end of the dressing down.

242
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:17,844
I just hate that part of the
job, you know? The power dynamic.

243
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,974
Well, you were
surprisingly restrained.

244
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:21,609
We will be well
rested tomorrow.

245
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,709
Okay. That's great, actually,

246
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:24,652
because I wanted to talk
to you about something else.

247
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:26,387
Excellent. Go for it.

248
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,426
I'm sure you got my e-mail
about the printer fires,

249
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:30,552
the one with
the branching decision tree.

250
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:32,256
I actually
designed that chart.

251
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,025
Kind of hoping
it catches on.

252
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:35,964
Anyway, the question is,

253
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:38,832
what is the best way to
disseminate important information

254
00:10:38,903 --> 00:10:40,200
in an efficient way?

255
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:43,803
Right. So let's...

256
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:45,839
Finally, there's a provision
here in the occurrence

257
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,673
that the child is
born an old man,

258
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:48,770
a la Benjamin Button.

259
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:50,644
Same page. Go to the next one.
Same page. We're fine there.

260
00:10:50,715 --> 00:10:52,080
Just keep moving.

261
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,742
Despite
the provision covering

262
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:55,376
whether this is all
part of The Matrix...

263
00:10:55,553 --> 00:10:56,918
Which we can't know...

264
00:10:57,255 --> 00:10:58,313
...this is essentially...

265
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,379
...unless we're unplugged...

266
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:02,456
...equivalent to a donor
or surrogate contract...

267
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:04,093
...and wake up in the future.

268
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:06,163
...which is
actually pretty common.

269
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:09,530
So, I have to tell you that
this is a solid contract.

270
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:12,129
What?

271
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:15,104
Look, I can't enforce that anybody
have a child with anyone else.

272
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,329
What?

273
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:19,002
So essentially
this comes down to damages.

274
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:22,778
Now, there is some precedence
for the range of $30,000.

275
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,273
What?

276
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:26,976
I don't have
$30,000 lying around.

277
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:28,417
I have it buried very deeply,

278
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:31,319
and I don't want to dig past
a certain someone to get it.

279
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,881
Chase Dixon is up,
could be a big play.

280
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,085
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

281
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:37,458
I know it's like cricket.

282
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:38,757
No. No.

283
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,798
Well, home plate
is like a wicket.

284
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:43,060
You don't know,
you don't know anything.

285
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:45,700
Look at him.
Look at him over there.

286
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,671
High fiving?
He didn't even do anything.

287
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,367
The kid did all the work.

288
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:51,599
I bet he does that at home.

289
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:55,043
I bet it's like, "Hey, Donna,
why don't you wash the dishes?

290
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:56,603
"High five, Donna."

291
00:11:56,681 --> 00:12:00,515
"Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?
High five. I'm taking all the credit."

292
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:02,348
He seems pretty
well liked by the team.

293
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,753
Okay, well, that's because
he's paying their salary.

294
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:09,019
You do know that high school
coaches don't pay their players.

295
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:11,028
I know. I know. I know.

296
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,161
That was a euphemism.

297
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:15,493
$30,000?
There's got to be another way.

298
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:18,602
He has a 60-acre beet farm
that is worth a small fortune.

299
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,328
Look, I will not pay.

300
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,230
Well, I have an alternative.

301
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:26,575
"Intercourse to completion
five individual times

302
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:27,872
"rendered at my discretion."

303
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:29,413
Look, I don't think
that's actually legal.

304
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:30,776
Agreed.

305
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:36,685
Five times for $30,000?
Not a bad stud fee.

306
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,484
Better than most horses.

307
00:12:38,823 --> 00:12:40,415
But not on your bed.
It's lumpy.

308
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,585
Those lumps are cats,
and those cats have names,

309
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,424
and those names are Amber,
Milky Way, Dianne and Lumpy.

310
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:47,228
Fine, five times.

311
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:49,357
Look, I can't legally
watch this unfold.

312
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:51,561
It's coming a little dangerously
close to prostitution.

313
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,098
I want eye contact.

314
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:54,263
No.
Yes.

315
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,204
Do you understand how rare
that is in nature?

316
00:12:56,274 --> 00:12:57,707
I'm not some farm animal.

317
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:03,004
Great game, Coach.
Shh.

318
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:04,810
Okay, all right,
don't, don't, don't.

319
00:13:05,183 --> 00:13:08,516
You guys are awesome. Best
game I've ever seen in my life.

320
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,654
Yeah, right. You must be
rooting for the other guys.

321
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:12,519
Ha! The other guys
can go die.

322
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,579
Okay.
Baseball!

323
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:14,682
Go talk to him.

324
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,192
No, God,
you go talk to him.

325
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:19,893
Shane, great game, man.

326
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:22,290
Do I know you?

327
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:23,391
No, just big fans.

328
00:13:23,668 --> 00:13:24,999
Both of us.

329
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,263
Are you somebody's
parents?

330
00:13:27,338 --> 00:13:30,705
Are you guys Kenny's dads?

331
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:34,245
No, no,
but we're gay for baseball.

332
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:36,776
Okay.
But I have a wife, actually,

333
00:13:36,848 --> 00:13:38,577
who I really love a lot.
Yeah.

334
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,810
Okay.

335
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:40,908
Let's go!

336
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:42,782
I am so into the
institution of marriage.

337
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:45,219
Isn't marriage the best,
you know?

338
00:13:45,423 --> 00:13:46,947
Two good people
finding each other,

339
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:49,016
getting all committed to
each other.

340
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:52,156
You love baseball,
what else do you love?

341
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:53,958
Let's round you out
as a person.

342
00:13:54,098 --> 00:13:56,828
Hey, I'm really sorry, I'm just
trying to focus here on the game.

343
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:59,802
I get it, man. I love it. That's
what makes you a good coach.

344
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:03,138
You know, but as a fan, it just
helps me enjoy the game better

345
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,699
if I know
the coach loves his wife.

346
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,704
Of course. Okay, I've
got to get back to this.

347
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,838
Of course.
All right.

348
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:12,712
But real quick, I want you
to meet my associate. Sheldon!

349
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:14,479
No, no, no. I'm good.
- Come on, get over here.

350
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:16,315
Get over here.
Oh, my God. All right.

351
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:18,514
Sheldon, say hi
to the nice coach.

352
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,852
Sorry, I've got
some stomach cramps.

353
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:21,853
It's all right, it's
all right, just keep it going.

354
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:23,951
Well, that was not at all
what I expected.

355
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:27,524
My heart's still racing.

356
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:30,529
I just looked a man in the
eyes and I shook his hand.

357
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:33,696
All the time I was thinking,
"I'm sleeping with your wife."

358
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:36,830
You know who does that?
James freaking Bond.

359
00:14:38,643 --> 00:14:41,009
Okay, orange slices.

360
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:42,546
There you go.
Thanks, Michael.

361
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:45,276
Don't thank me,
thank Dylan's mom.

362
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,510
There you go.

363
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:49,553
Why would you throw
something wet at me?

364
00:14:49,621 --> 00:14:50,713
You love it.

365
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:51,982
There you go.

366
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:53,850
Now, were those
for the team?

367
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:56,793
No. They didn't say "team,"
they just said "Coal Hawks."

368
00:14:56,995 --> 00:14:58,690
I don't think those
were yours to take.

369
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:00,253
Well, then, it wouldn't
be the first time

370
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:02,265
I stole something
away from Coach Shane.

371
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:03,828
I just want to
go on record as saying

372
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:06,132
that I do not
condone this affair.

373
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:07,967
And I even went so
far as to force Michael

374
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:10,166
to confront
the victim of his behavior.

375
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,266
Did you talk to him?
I did.

376
00:15:12,343 --> 00:15:15,244
You talked to the man whose wife
you're having an affair with?

377
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:17,008
Wow, that is crazy.

378
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:18,139
Was there a fist fight?

379
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:20,741
No, we just talked.
He's very nice.

380
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:22,012
And it didn't
change your mind?

381
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:23,178
It did not.

382
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:24,277
Michael, that's awful.

383
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:25,344
Isn't it?

384
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:26,720
Yes.
I'm awful, aren't I?

385
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:27,883
Yeah, that's pretty...

386
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,358
I'm an awful guy. Ooh!

387
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:30,655
How can you
live with yourself?

388
00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:32,628
I am what I am, Oscar.

389
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:36,423
And I want what I want. And
right now I want a piece of cake.

390
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:40,665
From now on, when I'm hungry, I am
going to eat whatever I am hungry for.

391
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:43,400
That is
a dangerous game, friend-o.

392
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:45,072
Well, because
I thought that it was

393
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:46,701
a book about Anthropologie,
the store.

394
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,678
I don't know why you were in
that part of the bookstore.

395
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:50,236
Because it's next to
the baby section, okay?

396
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:52,715
Well, that makes more sense. You
should have said that at the beginning,

397
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:54,445
when you said, "I read a
book about anthropology."

398
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:56,350
I don't even know why
you're screaming at me right now.

399
00:15:56,421 --> 00:15:57,683
I'm not screaming.
I'm not screaming.

400
00:15:58,122 --> 00:15:59,987
That's Meredith's cake.
It's her birthday.

401
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:01,582
I don't care.

402
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:04,059
I have an appetite for life.

403
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,024
Mmm.

404
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:10,131
God, that's lemon.

405
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:14,832
Good for you, man.
Good for you.

406
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:20,744
He takes what he wants.

407
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:24,571
You know what?

408
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:27,379
I think you're attractive
and I want to sleep with you.

409
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:28,710
What about Kelly?

410
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:30,618
You read my mind.

411
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:32,249
Is this a joke?

412
00:16:32,924 --> 00:16:34,186
Yep.

413
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:38,025
It's hard to
live that way, man.

414
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:40,860
You gotta really not care what
people think about you, right?

415
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:44,233
I don't know how you do it,
Michael. I can't be that cold.

416
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,165
You'll learn, baby,
you'll learn.

417
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:57,005
I am an honorable man
and I will honor the contract.

418
00:16:57,515 --> 00:16:59,312
But I don't have to
give her the good stuff.

419
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:03,152
Schrute sperm are strong, but they're
no match for a grown Schrute man.

420
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:06,720
Let's see what she gets.

421
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,622
Boss, we're out of paper.

422
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:14,756
Yeah, I noticed that.

423
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:16,732
Aren't you gonna add any more? Nope.

424
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:19,431
He don't give
an F about nothing.

425
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:21,932
I have got big balls.

426
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:24,697
I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

427
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:26,505
What about an
energy drink or something?

428
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:30,245
It gets in the breast milk. If I drink
it, Cece drinks it six hours later.

429
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:31,676
Well, it doesn't mean
I can't drink it.

430
00:17:31,749 --> 00:17:33,114
Well, it does and it doesn't.

431
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:36,382
I probably
shouldn't tell you this,

432
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:40,151
but a lot guys in the
warehouse work multiple jobs,

433
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:41,282
so we have a place.

434
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:42,882
A place?

435
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,086
A restful location.

436
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:46,663
Talk to Glen, he'll
take you up in the lift.

437
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:48,532
You sleep in the warehouse?

438
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:52,163
Light bulb's burned out,
so it's dark.

439
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,098
And the heat from the backup
generator keeps it nice and warm.

440
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:59,542
Sometimes I think about it when
I'm trying to fall asleep at home.

441
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:04,069
But as far as the rest of the
office goes, it doesn't exist. Okay?

442
00:18:04,148 --> 00:18:05,410
Okay.
Pam?

443
00:18:05,683 --> 00:18:06,843
Okay.

444
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:09,510
For your signature.

445
00:18:09,587 --> 00:18:10,611
Okay.

446
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:17,516
Phyllis?

447
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:20,689
Okay, look at me.

448
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:26,868
Phyllis, look at...
Okay, that's...

449
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:31,199
All right, all right, you
know what? I'm sick of this.

450
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:34,176
I'm sick of the little
disapproving head shakes.

451
00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:36,736
If you think that's going
to have any effect on me,

452
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:37,940
it will not.

453
00:18:38,015 --> 00:18:41,917
I am going to leave right now
and go to a motel to meet Donna.

454
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,582
Why not your condo?

455
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:47,450
Because a motel is dirty,
and it is sexy.

456
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:50,156
Like me and like Donna.

457
00:18:50,661 --> 00:18:53,755
And frankly, the stuff that we're
into isn't very condo-appropriate.

458
00:18:53,831 --> 00:18:55,526
Michael, will you drop it?

459
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,398
Everybody's spoken their mind
and no one's changing their mind.

460
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:01,231
Okay, Morgan Freeman
narrating everything.

461
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:03,068
Do you want someone to stop
you? Because no one's going to.

462
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:05,336
Nobody better try to stop me.

463
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:08,234
Good.

464
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:11,176
I could have stopped him.

465
00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:19,721
Are you warmed up?
No.

466
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:21,916
God, Angela, why is that
always my responsibility?

467
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:25,756
What did you
do to yourself?

468
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,388
Never mind.
Just... Never mind.

469
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:30,033
- Well, it better work.
- It'll work.

470
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:32,896
Stop kissing me.

471
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,130
It's not in the contract.

472
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,101
How do I feel about
breaking up with Donna?

473
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:18,607
Good. Moral.
I feel proud.

474
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,310
Like a grown-up.

475
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:25,114
That was not easy because
I really liked her a lot.

476
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,385
I'm a little bit
emotional right now

477
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:32,054
because I know that I absolutely
made the right decision.

478
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:35,331
At the end of the day,
we have to do what's right.

479
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,893
And it was either
living with myself

480
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:41,638
or being happy.

481
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,342
And I picked

482
00:20:47,178 --> 00:20:48,167
the

483
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:51,270
former.

484
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:57,217
Michael Scott?
Yes?

485
00:20:57,855 --> 00:20:59,550
Do you want to make
a comment on the rumors?

486
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:00,886
Um...

487
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,285
I have done some
very bad things.

488
00:21:05,062 --> 00:21:06,962
Things of which
I'm not proud.

489
00:21:07,198 --> 00:21:10,827
I would like to
publicly apologize

490
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,327
to the coach
and the players,

491
00:21:13,971 --> 00:21:16,633
and I vow to never

492
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:21,304
listen to my bodily
instincts ever again.

493
00:21:22,546 --> 00:21:24,878
I'm talking about the Sabre
printers that catch on fire.

494
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:29,610
Oh! Okay, I was talking
about... What's going on?
