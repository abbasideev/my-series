1
00:00:02,201 --> 00:00:06,604
Oscar, Toby said he
left my Girl Scout cookies on my chair.

2
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:10,099
Have you seen them?
Wait, I'm sitting on them.

3
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:11,536
This is awesome.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,544
Thank you. It didn't
even take that long.

5
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:16,308
What's the difference
between a chimichanga,

6
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:19,044
a chalupa and a tostada?

7
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:24,255
Call me back ASAP.
It's urgent.

8
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:29,017
Wait, this isn't funny.
I don't talk like that.

9
00:00:29,094 --> 00:00:30,527
Say, "Me eat cookie."

10
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:32,794
No. I won't say it.

11
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:34,423
Why is everyone
clumped around accounting?

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,558
Break it up, you clique.

13
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:38,626
It's Kevin as Cookie
Monster from Sesame Street.

14
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:40,638
Is that the program where all
those puppets live in the barrio?

15
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,173
Mmm-hmm.
I love that show.

16
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:44,801
This is Kevin.
This is Kevin.

17
00:00:45,444 --> 00:00:47,378
Thank you.
That is an amusing link.

18
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:48,606
I'd like it sent
to me, please.

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,238
Me, too, Oscar, please send
it to me. Yeah, totally.

20
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:52,180
Yeah, me, too.

21
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:54,276
Angela,
this is inappropriate.

22
00:00:54,553 --> 00:00:56,350
This is my favorite day.

23
00:01:17,342 --> 00:01:19,139
It's Secretary's Day.

24
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:22,910
And it is Erin's and my
three-week anniversary,

25
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:26,508
so perfect storm
for a romantic gesture.

26
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:30,149
Want to make sure the whole office
remembers it's Secretary's Day.

27
00:01:30,222 --> 00:01:34,124
I sent an email blast, a text blast,
a good old-fashioned talk blast.

28
00:01:34,193 --> 00:01:36,388
I sent a snail-mail
blast a week ago,

29
00:01:36,462 --> 00:01:39,090
and a stern reminder via fax
at 7:00 this morning,

30
00:01:39,164 --> 00:01:43,066
so people better step up and
appreciate the crap out of Erin.

31
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:44,159
Oh, thank you.

32
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:45,328
I do.

33
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,870
Thank you.

34
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,436
If it wasn't for secretaries,
I wouldn't have a stepmom.

35
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:56,981
Welcome back.
Hey, thanks.

36
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:01,543
It's my first day back after maternity
leave, and I miss Cece, of course.

37
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:03,752
But we need the money.

38
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:07,957
What was maternity leave
like? Oh. How do I explain it?

39
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:11,487
It rocked.
It rocked my ass off.

40
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:16,429
Oh. You couldn't
have watered it?

41
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:20,029
I literally did not know that
existed until this moment.

42
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:23,804
Well, I knew it existed,
and I chose to let it die.

43
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:26,076
It's nice to see
you again, Dwight.

44
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,237
Hello, Pam.

45
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:30,076
I was just wondering what you
had planned for Secretary's Day.

46
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:31,912
I'm going to give Erin $15.

47
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:36,614
I know that Erin would be so
psyched if you took her out to lunch.

48
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:38,217
A one-on-one
lunch with Erin?

49
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,690
Yeah. She really
looks up to you.

50
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,125
There's only so much we
can do as her coworkers.

51
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:46,756
Secretary's Day is really
kind of a boss-secretary thing.

52
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,729
She's kind of a rube.

53
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:53,998
That's my girlfriend
you're talking about.

54
00:02:54,072 --> 00:02:57,508
Okay. All right. All right.
Okay, I'll take her to lunch.

55
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:59,407
She's gonna be so psyched.

56
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:01,839
Hi, Erin.
Happy Secretary's Day.

57
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:03,313
Well, happy boss's day.

58
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:05,473
There wouldn't be a secretary
if there was no boss.

59
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:07,485
I wanted to know what
your plans for lunch were,

60
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:11,512
because I was hoping
to ask you to lunch.

61
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:14,690
I got a picture of you
asking me to lunch.

62
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,461
I was thinking we could go to
Hayworth's, just the two of us.

63
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,430
Well, Hayworth's
is more business-casual,

64
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:22,831
and they always screw
up your order, so I'm...

65
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:26,234
Oh. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that
was a stupid suggestion.

66
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:29,103
I was thinking someplace special,
so I thought Hayworth's, but...

67
00:03:29,174 --> 00:03:30,505
Okay, well, we'll figure something out.

68
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:32,237
Okay.

69
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:36,110
Okay, let's go
to Hayworth's.

70
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:37,341
Okay!

71
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:39,944
Have a cookie, Kev.

72
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:43,454
Yeah, ha, ha, tray of cookies.
I'm not falling for that.

73
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:46,187
I brought those in.
It's my birthday.

74
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:48,419
That's some stone-cold
narcissism right there.

75
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:50,393
Man, Darryl, I'm sorry.

76
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:53,156
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

77
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:01,667
They're making fun of
Cookie Monster. I get that.

78
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:05,607
But in a strange way, it feels
like they're making fun of me.

79
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:11,038
Oscar, did you
eat some of my M&M's? The level...

80
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:12,674
This is violent
and offensive.

81
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:13,945
Thank you.

82
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:16,887
And it really makes me
self-conscious about my voice.

83
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:18,422
That's awful.

84
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:21,318
I'm not crying.

85
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:22,758
You have some
food on your face.

86
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:25,991
Do my hands feel
sweaty to you?

87
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:28,697
The beginning here has
been a little bit of a fiasco.

88
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:32,563
Either they don't respect me,
or they respect me too much.

89
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:36,368
And some of them still think
that I'm the IT guy.

90
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:39,403
This Cookie Monster thing is
an opportunity to show people

91
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:41,673
that I'm an authority figure.

92
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:47,674
Hello, everyone. If I might
have a moment of your time.

93
00:04:47,986 --> 00:04:50,352
It's come to my attention
that people have been watching

94
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:52,822
and laughing at
a hurtful parody video.

95
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:57,385
It is now forbidden to talk,
joke about, or email this around.

96
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:58,755
Yeah.

97
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:01,655
And that's straight
from corporate, so...

98
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:04,361
Not to be scary, but,
yeah, I would listen to me.

99
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:05,960
And that's all.

100
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:17,841
Would you mind if I
listened to my book on tape?

101
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,816
I'm kind of a bookworm.

102
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,881
This is a novelization of the movie Precious,
Based on the Book Push by Sapphire.

103
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:28,414
I was thinking it would be
fun to talk on the way over.

104
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,825
What decade would you have
chosen to be a teenager?

105
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:35,297
I don't know.

106
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,062
I would have
chosen the 1490s.

107
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:40,134
'Cause America
was discovered.

108
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:41,229
Right.

109
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:46,801
And then my last job was
at a Taco Bell Express,

110
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:51,247
but then it became a full Taco Bell
and, I don't know, I couldn't keep up.

111
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:54,649
My favorite part about being a receptionist
is that I get to have my own desk.

112
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,780
At my foster home I never
had a desk, so it's like...

113
00:05:57,856 --> 00:06:00,484
I don't mean that I didn't like
my foster home. I did like it.

114
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,390
I just didn't have
a desk there.

115
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:05,453
Did you have a favorite age? Or month?

116
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:08,296
An age or month?

117
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:12,303
Yeah, like a favorite month. Like,
I liked April when I was seven.

118
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:15,670
I've been trying. I've been
trying to keep it going.

119
00:06:18,276 --> 00:06:20,767
Erin is just weird.

120
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:23,081
How many pillows
do you sleep on at night?

121
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:25,548
So how are
things going with Andy?

122
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:27,881
He's the best boyfriend
in the world.

123
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,811
Tell me about him
before I met him.

124
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:32,356
Well, let's see...

125
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:36,957
Andy plays the banjo.

126
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:38,689
Yeah, I love that.

127
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:43,863
Other than the fact that he dated Angela,
I don't think he is a snappy dresser.

128
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:45,061
What?

129
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,900
I don't think he is the best
dresser. Reminds me of Easter.

130
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:52,034
Sorry. About Angela.
Did you say he dated Angela?

131
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:55,671
Mmm-hmm.
You didn't know that?

132
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:57,305
Here we go.
Hot plate.

133
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:58,406
Oh, okay.

134
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:00,280
And your
salad, miss.

135
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:03,180
Why wouldn't
he tell me that?

136
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,483
I don't know.

137
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,480
Probably didn't want you
to have a mental image

138
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:08,992
of him having sex
with somebody else.

139
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,084
They had sex?

140
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:12,130
They were engaged, so...

141
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:16,124
Okay, you know what, sir?

142
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:17,259
Yes?

143
00:07:17,335 --> 00:07:20,099
Yeah, I asked for pickles on my burger,
and there are only, like, five or six.

144
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:21,537
Can I get some
more pickles?

145
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:23,801
Of course. I'll get
you a bowl of pickles.

146
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,069
Thank you.

147
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,902
They were engaged?

148
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:28,240
Mmm-hmm.

149
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:30,507
Yeah.

150
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:33,343
Uh-oh.

151
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:34,578
Well...

152
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:41,452
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

153
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:44,359
In the foster home,
my hair was my room.

154
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:52,802
Okay, okay, you know what?
You know what? You know what?

155
00:07:52,871 --> 00:07:55,465
Everybody's looking
at you right now.

156
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:01,805
I'll have what
she's having.

157
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:09,681
Did you have a...
Did you like your lunch?

158
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:11,221
Did you have a good lunch?

159
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:15,390
Did you like that?
Did you enjoy your food?

160
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,121
It was good.
I liked my lunch.

161
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:21,996
What's up?

162
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:24,429
Her milk is coming in.
She's getting uncomfortable.

163
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:25,527
Dwight, don't be gross.

164
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:27,435
No, no, he's right.

165
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:31,271
Same thing happens with my cows if
I don't tend them frequently enough.

166
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,834
You gotta milk them, or
else they'll moo like crazy.

167
00:08:33,912 --> 00:08:35,436
That's weird,
my breast pump is missing.

168
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:37,038
Have you seen
my breast pump?

169
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:38,742
All right, this is
gonna traumatize me

170
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:41,877
a hell of a lot more
than you, believe me.

171
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:45,616
You know what, Dwight? Let me just
check the bathroom first. Okay?

172
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,488
Really? Fine.
Let your breasts explode.

173
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,391
Three squeezes
and I would drain you.

174
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:51,895
Mmm.

175
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:57,064
Meredith! MEREDITH: I
just like the way it feels.

176
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:58,932
- What are you doing?
- Just relax, okay?

177
00:08:59,004 --> 00:08:59,993
Relax?

178
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:01,402
This is like
the Cadillac of pumps.

179
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:02,599
Give it
back to me, now!

180
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:04,699
Okay. I was just
warming it up.

181
00:09:04,776 --> 00:09:05,936
That's...
It's disgusting!

182
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:07,205
It's not a big deal.

183
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,610
It's not sterile!

184
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,375
We're both girls.
Who cares?

185
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:27,157
So, how was lunch?

186
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,997
Lunch was fine.

187
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:32,628
Was it everything that you
hoped and dreamed it might be?

188
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,430
I don't know.
It was lunch, Andy.

189
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:38,169
Well, I know, I'm...
That's what I'm...

190
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,003
Just wondering...
I mean...

191
00:09:43,148 --> 00:09:44,945
Erin, I think we're
out of fax cover sheets.

192
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:48,281
God, Oscar, will you keep
your pants on? It's easy.

193
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:55,749
My name
is Kevin. I'm an accountant.

194
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:57,055
You see?
I did the voice.

195
00:09:57,128 --> 00:09:58,857
It's a little derivative.

196
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,295
But parody is
always derivative.

197
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:02,356
It's not organic.
Do you know what I mean?

198
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:04,061
Jim does a really good one. Do yours.

199
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:06,365
Oh, guys, I really
refuse to participate.

200
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:09,532
"Michael, can
I have an advance on my paycheck,

201
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:13,339
"because a Mrs. Fields Cookies
just opened up at the mall!"

202
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:17,072
Guys, why don't we leave the
parodies to the pros at MADtv?

203
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:20,879
"Sorry, Gabe, but that show
hasn't been on in many cookies."

204
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:22,178
Okay.

205
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:25,681
Hey, can I have
your attention, please?

206
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:26,746
First of all,
thanks to everyone

207
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:30,124
for helping put this
awesome party together,

208
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:34,689
and a very special shout-out to the
chair of the party planning committee,

209
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:38,259
Miss Angela Martin.
You have outdone yourself.

210
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:39,829
Yeah, you know what?

211
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:43,340
I think we can all agree that
Angela's not so great, so...

212
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:46,104
I'm saying the exact opposite.
Angela is fantastic.

213
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:47,701
No, no, no.

214
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:49,110
Specific shout-out.

215
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:50,508
Stop talking.

216
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:56,179
Okay. As some of you may know, I have a
very special connection to Secretary's Day

217
00:10:56,254 --> 00:11:01,351
in the form of that 115-pound
moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon.

218
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:04,890
To a lot of you she may just be the person
who brings you your fax confirmations,

219
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:07,898
but to me,
she is my girlfriend,

220
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:12,330
in addition to being the person
who brings me my fax confirmations.

221
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:16,431
So, I wrote
a little ditty

222
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:20,874
that I would like to play
for all of you right now.

223
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:26,440
It's a little tune called
Secretary of Love.

224
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:29,786
One, two, one, two, three...

225
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:32,588
I know about Angela.

226
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:34,056
I know that you
were engaged to her

227
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,183
and that you were
sleeping with her.

228
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,285
Michael told me.
Oh, God.

229
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,727
Erin, can we talk
about this in private?

230
00:11:39,798 --> 00:11:43,427
I don't want it to be in
private. Is it true or is it not?

231
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:48,035
Yes. Who else did you sleep with?

232
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:52,600
Did you sleep with Phyllis or
Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?

233
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:53,666
No. No. No. No.

234
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:55,872
Did everyone know? Was I
the only one who didn't know?

235
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:56,971
Yeah. Pretty much.

236
00:11:57,082 --> 00:11:58,071
Pretty much.
Yeah.

237
00:11:58,216 --> 00:12:02,016
Who are you? I don't know you. Get away!

238
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:08,215
I should probably
get involved in this,

239
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:12,525
but I think my energy is better
spent on the Cookie Monster issue.

240
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:17,467
Erin, you know, if I had been
engaged to anybody before you,

241
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,400
I would have told you.

242
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:21,295
Thanks.

243
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:24,432
So if you need anything,
I'm right over there.

244
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:31,540
"Hey, Erin, you
look delicious! I mean, beautiful."

245
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:35,784
Okay. Okay.
There, I heard that.

246
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:38,448
So, I'm sorry, Pam,
but that's it.

247
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:42,486
I'm going to have to suspend
you without pay for two days.

248
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,926
What? What do you mean, suspend me?

249
00:12:44,996 --> 00:12:46,429
I think you need
to go a little easy.

250
00:12:46,498 --> 00:12:47,829
You can't just suspend
someone from work.

251
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:51,699
Yeah, you're right. You know
what? You're suspended too, Jim.

252
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:56,633
Okay.
Fine. You too, Dwight.

253
00:12:56,708 --> 00:13:00,109
Wait, what? I was just slow-clapping
your no-nonsense decision-making.

254
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:02,669
I don't want to hear it.
Suspended.

255
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:07,450
"C" is for suspension.

256
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:14,386
Why would that be something that you
would talk about on Secretary's Day?

257
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,758
Andy, she's not the easiest person in
the world to have a conversation with.

258
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:21,265
All right? And besides, who
doesn't tell their girlfriend

259
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:24,790
that they were engaged to someone
who works four feet away from them?

260
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:28,236
That's like... That's... That's
like Mr. & Mrs. Smith crap.

261
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:30,774
I was gonna tell her,
just on my own time.

262
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:34,243
You know what? I resent the implication
that I would keep that secret.

263
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:37,873
Everyone here knows that I
can't and won't keep a secret.

264
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:40,914
Who cares?

265
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:46,089
I mean, it's not like I killed
somebody. Big deal, right?

266
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:48,057
This is gonna blow
over in two seconds.

267
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:50,560
She never asked me, so if you
think about it, it's kind of...

268
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:54,428
I probably should have told her, I
guess. Everybody does stupid things.

269
00:13:56,434 --> 00:13:57,867
Psst.

270
00:13:57,936 --> 00:13:59,961
Hey. Erin.

271
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:03,802
You want to talk to me,
come to my desk.

272
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:15,985
You embarrassed me earlier.

273
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:18,147
Take it up with
the chief of police.

274
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:22,522
You think I want people remembering
I had sensual relations with Andy?

275
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:24,390
It's the kind of thing you
wish you could have annulled.

276
00:14:24,462 --> 00:14:26,259
I want to throw up
just thinking about it.

277
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:28,697
I want to throw up
just thinking about it.

278
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:31,200
You are throwing up
for the wrong reasons.

279
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:33,863
I don't think this
fax is going through.

280
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:36,066
Oh...

281
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,338
Is there a different... I guess
put it through again, you know?

282
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:49,477
Hey.

283
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:54,089
You know,
I was engaged before Jim.

284
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,218
Really?

285
00:14:57,295 --> 00:14:59,126
Yeah. And he
worked here, too.

286
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:02,223
It was Andy,
wasn't it?

287
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,530
No, no, it wasn't Andy. It wasn't.

288
00:15:05,637 --> 00:15:07,298
It doesn't matter.

289
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:11,037
It's not about
who you've been with.

290
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:12,542
It's about who
you end up with.

291
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:18,708
Sometimes the heart doesn't know what
it wants until it finds what it wants.

292
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:27,552
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

293
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:32,326
Thank you.

294
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:47,272
So I can reprimand them,
but I can't suspend them?

295
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:51,875
Oh, I can't do either?
Uh-huh.

296
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,042
Fair enough.

297
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:55,879
Hey, Toby.
- I called Tallahassee.

298
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:59,481
Now, he can ask you not to come in, but
he can't dock your pay. It's not legal.

299
00:15:59,557 --> 00:16:00,785
Very interesting.

300
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:03,292
I also learned some interesting things
about how they structure their...

301
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:05,261
Thanks, Toby.

302
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,957
Hey, everyone. Hi.

303
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:10,467
Quite an afternoon, huh?

304
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:13,698
Cathartic, in a way. I'm glad
that I got to share it with you.

305
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:16,506
Makes you think about
what's really important.

306
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:20,305
It's not about showing you're in charge
or flexing some sort of authority.

307
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:22,243
It's about forgiveness.

308
00:16:22,313 --> 00:16:25,407
And, yes, I'm talking about you
three in this desk clump right here.

309
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:27,314
I think that if you
were to apologize to me,

310
00:16:27,385 --> 00:16:29,649
then I would revoke
your suspension.

311
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:31,848
I don't think
an apology is enough.

312
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:36,690
I really think the only way for me to
learn my lesson is to take my suspension.

313
00:16:37,128 --> 00:16:39,619
And I gotta take
this bad attitude

314
00:16:39,697 --> 00:16:41,722
and I gotta go home
and I got to adjust it.

315
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,596
Oh, come on. I hope
the suspension does that.

316
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:45,295
Yeah.
Prideful idiots.

317
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,739
Watch how it's done.
Gabriel, I apologize.

318
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:51,801
Great.

319
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:54,840
I kneel before you.

320
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:58,413
Guys, I would even take a
contrite look as an apology.

321
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:02,010
Humbly taking your hand upon
which I kiss to show my contrition.

322
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:06,920
Guys, to...
To err is human.

323
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,028
Trust is the most
important thing to me.

324
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,691
Is your name
Andy Bernard?

325
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:18,702
What's your real name?
Lionel Frankenstein?

326
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,102
Will you stop walking
for one second?

327
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:23,640
That's it. There's no
other secrets, okay?

328
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:28,372
I mean, yeah, my chest
is not naturally hairless,

329
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:30,414
and my parents pay
my credit card bill.

330
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:32,813
How long were
you guys together?

331
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:34,078
A year.

332
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:36,180
A year?

333
00:17:37,955 --> 00:17:39,388
You were together
for a year?

334
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:42,915
Yeah. But that's it. Now
you know everything about me.

335
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:47,421
I promise. And if I
think of anything else...

336
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:51,363
I think I have to be on
my own for a little bit.

337
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:56,567
Like that girl Precious in Precious,
Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire. Okay?

338
00:17:57,675 --> 00:17:59,643
I didn't see that movie.

339
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:06,446
That was ugly. I'm sorry
that you had to see that.

340
00:18:06,517 --> 00:18:07,814
Well, do they
still get paid?

341
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:09,978
It's tacky to
discuss finances.

342
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:11,919
It's best to pretend
that this never happened.

343
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:13,684
Sounds like they just got
to go home with pay.

344
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:15,350
Yeah.
Pathetic.

345
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,653
Can I buy
everyone coffees?

346
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:22,461
Or cookies!

347
00:18:24,535 --> 00:18:25,559
- What was that?
- So gross.

348
00:18:25,636 --> 00:18:26,762
Are you kidding me?

349
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:28,863
Was that an impression?
All right.

350
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:34,344
"Guys, I'm now going
to apologize for the mess that we're in,

351
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:36,606
"because corporate
told me to.

352
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:40,842
"I just want you to know,
I laugh like a crazy person."

353
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:42,510
Okay, you gotta
be able to...

354
00:18:42,587 --> 00:18:46,250
You gotta be able to laugh at
yourself here. One of the gang.

355
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:50,021
"I have to go back to the zoo
to the stick insect exhibit."

356
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:51,721
Yeah.

357
00:18:53,364 --> 00:18:56,800
"Ciao. " Right? "Ciao.

358
00:18:57,201 --> 00:19:00,295
"I say ciao 'cause I'm
fancy from Tallahassee."

359
00:19:00,938 --> 00:19:03,736
Why don't we say
ciao to the impressions?

360
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:06,333
Ciao.

361
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:09,412
Stick insect.

362
00:19:11,048 --> 00:19:13,073
God.

363
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:17,079
Erin?
Oh.

364
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:19,514
Sorry. I thought
everyone was gone.

365
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,457
No, no. I was just watching Cookie
Monster. It finally downloaded.

366
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:23,585
Do you mind
if I sit down?

367
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:24,685
Yeah.

368
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:26,024
What's...

369
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:29,863
I can't trust
Andy anymore.

370
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:35,839
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that.
I feel... I'm sorry I caused that.

371
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:37,033
It's Andy's fault.

372
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:40,100
Well, yeah. Yes. So...
But I still feel sorry.

373
00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:48,652
You know what? I wouldn't
worry about Angela. She's...

374
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,288
She doesn't hold
a candle to you, Erin.

375
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:55,416
She's old enough to be
your mom, for one thing,

376
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,223
and she's, like,
three feet tall,

377
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:04,763
And she wears
pioneer women clothing,

378
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:08,794
and I don't think she's
ever pooped in her life.

379
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:14,709
And Andy? You know... Come on. Andy,
his butt looks big in those khakis.

380
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:16,747
Oh, I like his butt.

381
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:19,911
You said butt.

382
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:21,246
You tricked me.

383
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:27,218
You'd love...

384
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,488
This... This guy in my
neighborhood, Tom Dizemore.

385
00:20:30,828 --> 00:20:34,594
This is him.
"Hey! Hey, Scott..."

386
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:38,601
Sometimes telling
someone something is hard.

387
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:44,234
Well, at least somebody made
her happy on Secretary's Day.

388
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:49,044
Hey, Kevin, it's Oscar.
I'm looking at the sheet you sent me,

389
00:20:49,113 --> 00:20:51,206
and I can't seem to find the
column for shipping costs...

390
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:55,343
I made the most
brilliant retaliation video.

391
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,181
It is so awesome.

392
00:20:58,522 --> 00:21:00,046
I don't get it.

393
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:02,318
Yeah, I mean, the Count
has a very distinct voice.

394
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:03,519
Thank you.

395
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:05,357
Yeah, "I want
to count to 10."

396
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:06,418
Yeah.

397
00:21:06,497 --> 00:21:07,623
But Oscar is
an accountant,

398
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:09,893
and the Count
counts numbers.

399
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:11,730
You're an accountant,
too, so it doesn't...

400
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:13,360
Why didn't you do
Oscar the Grouch?

401
00:21:13,437 --> 00:21:14,995
That would have been funny.
That would have been funny.

402
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:18,132
But the Count is purple,
and Oscar wears purple.

403
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:23,408
Oh! Oh! I was just watching
that. Did you do that, man? Oscar!

404
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:27,975
And the Count! Nailed him. Nailed
him! Good work, Cookie Monster.

405
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:29,516
Thank you.
