1
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:05,935
Got you! Broken arm.
Boom! Boom! Boom!

2
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:09,998
Broken nose! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Broken nose! Gonna flip you.

3
00:00:10,075 --> 00:00:12,305
Once a year, Dwight holds
a seminar updating us

4
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:14,846
on the newest developments
in the world of karate.

5
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:16,437
Because,
as we all know,

6
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:19,279
the one thing that thousand-year-old
martial arts do all the time

7
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:20,613
is change.

8
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:24,745
How can I pose this to
you in a relatable way?

9
00:00:24,823 --> 00:00:27,656
You are all members
of the Yakuza,

10
00:00:27,726 --> 00:00:30,695
and you happen to be visiting
the Lackawanna Trolley Museum,

11
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:33,357
and you are attacked
by Triads.

12
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:37,061
How can you hold them off
until your clan arrives?

13
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:39,866
You cannot go wrong
with a throat punch.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,670
Okay, so there's no defense
for that. Good to know.

15
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:46,575
No, there is a defense for
that. Let me demonstrate.

16
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:48,237
Someone attack me.
Kevin, go!

17
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:49,610
No way.

18
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:51,808
Last time, you pulled
my pants down,

19
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:54,250
and then you tried to
choke me with my shoelace.

20
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:58,050
False. I did choke you with
your shoelace. Now come at me!

21
00:00:58,123 --> 00:00:59,784
Okay, with all due respect
to everyone here,

22
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:03,521
I think the most worthy
opponent of you is you.

23
00:01:03,595 --> 00:01:06,689
That is correct, unless there
happen to be measles present.

24
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:10,360
So let's just say that Dwight has
come at you with the throat punch.

25
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:12,802
Now, how would you, Dwight,
defend against it?

26
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:14,862
Easy. Allow me
to demonstrate.

27
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,376
I am attacking myself with a
throat punch. Here it comes.

28
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:21,572
Block. Grasp wrist as such.

29
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:22,739
And what if he comes at
you with the other hand?

30
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:24,146
Because he does have two.

31
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:28,183
Good point. Second throat
punch. Absorb the blow.

32
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:32,450
Groin punch. Hit,
block, elbow to the gut!

33
00:01:32,524 --> 00:01:34,788
Uh-oh! Up to the nose!
No, you're not!

34
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:39,764
Oh, my God, he's making
you look like such a fool.

35
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:42,323
He really is,
but not for long.

36
00:01:43,368 --> 00:01:47,202
Ow! God! Instep!
Not again!

37
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:52,005
You let go! You let go! I can't hold on!

38
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,172
You two are so
evenly matched,

39
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:56,339
I don't know how one of you
is gonna get the upper hand.

40
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:58,144
The important thing
to remember, Jim,

41
00:01:58,217 --> 00:02:02,381
we always have what is called
the element of surprise.

42
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:28,936
But I would say
my favorite art form

43
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:31,278
is a tie between sculpting
and stand-up comedy.

44
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,476
I did stand-up comedy once.

45
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:33,916
You did?
Yeah, I killed.

46
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:35,214
That sounds like
it was hilarious.

47
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:36,413
It was hilarious.

48
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:37,477
Michael?
Yes?

49
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:39,547
What is the meaning of this
e-mail that everyone got?

50
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,115
You'll have to be
more specific, Dwight.

51
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:43,252
I get like
eight e-mails a day.

52
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,320
This one. "From David Wallace
to all Dunder Mifflin."

53
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:47,763
Whoo-hoo! Shout-out.

54
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,892
"Hello, everyone. I'm sure you've
seen the item in the Journal.

55
00:02:49,968 --> 00:02:51,993
"Just want to stress,
it's all conjecture.

56
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,335
"If there's any concrete
news, you will know ASAP."

57
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:56,396
Erin, do we have
the Journal?

58
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:57,464
Your "feelings journal"?

59
00:02:57,543 --> 00:02:58,703
You told me to put it
in the time capsule.

60
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:00,404
Did you?
Michael,

61
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,447
he means The Wall Street
Journal online.

62
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:03,708
Oh, "The wall."

63
00:03:03,782 --> 00:03:05,147
I found the article.

64
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,953
"On a day marked by panicked
corporate board meetings,

65
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:12,149
"one that is relatively
unsurprising is Dunder Mifflin's.

66
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:14,624
"It is rumored that
they will recommend..."

67
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:16,524
And the article cuts off.

68
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:18,620
It's $1.99 to
finish the article.

69
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:21,860
I wonder what
it was gonna say.

70
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:23,526
Are you serious?

71
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:28,436
I got it, I got it. Oh!
Tuna beat me to it.

72
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:32,170
"It is rumored that they will
recommend declaring bankruptcy?"

73
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:34,371
No, no. That doesn't
make any sense.

74
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:36,539
Oh, Lord, we're all
gonna lose our jobs.

75
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:38,708
Not necessarily. Bankruptcy
could mean a lot of things.

76
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:40,342
Maybe they're just
restructuring to get out of debt.

77
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:42,114
Right.
Oh, that sounds awful.

78
00:03:42,187 --> 00:03:43,950
Or it could mean
the end of Dunder Mifflin.

79
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:47,082
Oh, God! Well, that's
an interesting theory.

80
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,251
You know what?

81
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:51,922
You can all have jobs at Schrute
Farms as human scarecrows.

82
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:54,056
It doesn't pay much
and you can't unionize.

83
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:55,961
I'm sorry,
Michael. David's in a meeting.

84
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:58,229
Ah, well, maybe you
should spy on him.

85
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:03,202
Oh, my God!
Wouldn't that be hilarious?

86
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:07,011
I'll just have him call
you back when he's free.

87
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,239
Okay, okay. Good.

88
00:04:08,313 --> 00:04:11,476
I'll catch you on
the flippity-flip. Bye!

89
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,518
He's busy.
Call me back when he's free.

90
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:23,155
Michael, are you okay?
Did you throw up in there?

91
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:25,822
No, just pooping.
You know how I be.

92
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:27,728
But it smells like
throw-up in here.

93
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:29,596
Crazy world,
lot of smells.

94
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:32,263
You guys, what if this
is our last day at work?

95
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:35,238
What if we never see
each other ever again?

96
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,473
I like Erin.
There, I said it.

97
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,340
I was kind of hoping
she would ask me out,

98
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:49,717
but things have not
panned out on that front,

99
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:52,680
so, it's time
for the Nard-Dog

100
00:04:52,758 --> 00:04:55,693
to take matters
into his own paws.

101
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:15,104
Everything is gonna

102
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:17,838
We have to do something, because
people are losing it out there,

103
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,713
wondering what's
gonna happen.

104
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:22,720
Okay, we need some sort of
distraction for everybody.

105
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:24,619
Is there anything new
on YouTube? Michael...

106
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,784
Doesn't even need
to be good. Oh, God!

107
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:30,293
I can't think.
I need more Mullins.

108
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:34,461
Listen, Wallace said these
were just rumors, right?

109
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:37,297
So we have no reason to think that
the company's anything but fine.

110
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:38,768
So if we just go on
with our work,

111
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:40,668
you and me,
they'll follow along.

112
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:41,763
Monkey see, monkey do.

113
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,331
That's it.
Monkey pee all over you.

114
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:48,106
That rhymes. So what have
we on the docket today?

115
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,741
We have a monthly
staff meeting.

116
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:54,650
All right!
Let's conference room it up!

117
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,120
Here's the deal, guys. There
is no new information as of yet,

118
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:59,214
so I suggest we all
just keep working.

119
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,624
Sure, I'm a little nervous, but doing
our work will make us feel better.

120
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:05,356
I only slack off
when things are good.

121
00:06:06,164 --> 00:06:09,224
Customers have to use the
coupon code from the website.

122
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:10,893
And as of now, there
is no differentiation

123
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:13,199
between the letter O and the zero,

124
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:15,501
but we are working on that.
Stay tuned for that.

125
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:17,940
He needs me.
Seat-save infinity.

126
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:19,169
Okay, great.

127
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:20,973
Also...
Oh, God! What?

128
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:24,808
Oh, my God.

129
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:26,612
What?
Michael, what happened?

130
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:29,210
Is there news?
There has been a murder!

131
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:31,380
What?
What?

132
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:34,789
There's been a murder
in Savannah.

133
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:43,861
Games have the power to
distract people from stressful situations.

134
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:46,426
Battleship got me through
my parents' divorce.

135
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:50,669
Operation got me through my
vasectomy, i.e., "My Operation."

136
00:06:50,742 --> 00:06:52,004
I don't think

137
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:54,511
I would have been able to
endure my break-up with Holly

138
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:56,513
had it not been
for Toss Across.

139
00:06:56,581 --> 00:07:00,176
"Belles, Bourbon, and Bullets, a
murder mystery dinner party game."

140
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:01,549
It is so much fun.

141
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,316
Everybody plays a character,
we go around the room,

142
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:06,514
we try to figure out
who did it.

143
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:10,152
Hey, I'm wondering if
this is a terrible idea.

144
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:12,924
This is my call, Jim. Big
picture stuff. It's about murder.

145
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:15,489
I thought we agreed that we
wouldn't do things like this.

146
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:17,660
Tube City.
You owe me one.

147
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:21,830
Co-managing is
a give and take.

148
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:23,431
You have to
pick your battles.

149
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:25,237
One of the battles
that I picked

150
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,608
was to stop Michael
from running plastic tubes

151
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:31,513
all over the office and
placing hamsters inside of them.

152
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,676
He was gonna call it
Tube City.

153
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:37,354
So, yes,
I do owe him one...

154
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:42,788
August 5th, 1955.

155
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:45,455
It's a sad day
down here in Savannah.

156
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,465
Local magnate Bill Bourbon
was killed last night,

157
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,761
and all y'all have
congregated tonight for a meal

158
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:53,896
to celebrate Bill as he
passes on to his great reward.

159
00:07:53,972 --> 00:07:56,270
But you're not just here
to pay your respects.

160
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:59,606
You have to figure out which of y'all is
the no-account scoundrel who killed him.

161
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:02,010
This is ridiculous.

162
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,241
There will be food. You
leave, you do not get food.

163
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:05,943
What kind of food?
Sandwich platters.

164
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:08,008
I'm in.
Baby carrots.

165
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:12,985
Okay, here are your
character cards.

166
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:16,255
Take one, pass it down.
Here is your prop box.

167
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:18,922
Some of your characters
will have props.

168
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:22,489
Now, on your character card,
it tells you who you are

169
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:23,966
and what your alibi is.

170
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:26,128
Everything else is
up to your imagination.

171
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:29,640
So if you talk slowly
in real life,

172
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:33,405
your character could, say, have
been kicked in the head by a horse.

173
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:34,638
Cool. I'll try it.

174
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:37,113
Okay. Use your
imaginations.

175
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:38,342
Who did you get?

176
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,713
"Naughty Nellie Nutmeg,

177
00:08:39,784 --> 00:08:42,810
"a vivacious young socialite
with a penchant for scandal."

178
00:08:42,888 --> 00:08:44,014
Ooh!

179
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:45,522
Saucy.
How about you?

180
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:51,495
"Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local
bartender and Nellie's brother."

181
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:55,061
Michael, I don't like
this game. It's scary.

182
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:56,430
It's not scary.

183
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:57,695
I don't like
my character.

184
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:58,827
Who are you?

185
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:02,362
"Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch
doctor of the Savannah swamps."

186
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,668
I'm not comfortable
with this.

187
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:04,936
Well, how do you
think I feel?

188
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,379
I mean, I have to play "Caleb
Crawdad," handsome playboy.

189
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:12,109
Every night
a different woman,

190
00:09:12,183 --> 00:09:17,314
being ogled, having to
hug and kiss and spoon.

191
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,717
I make them
feel beautiful.

192
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:22,657
Well, well, well!

193
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:25,855
What is this contraption,
I do declare?

194
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:28,422
It's my BlackBerry, Michael. I'm
trying to get updates on the company.

195
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,027
Who's Michael? I'm Caleb
Crawdad, I do declare.

196
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:33,764
You don't have to keep
saying, "I do declare,"

197
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:35,396
anytime you say something,
it means you're declaring.

198
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:36,997
That is the way
Southern people talk.

199
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:39,043
And what designing woman
are you basing that on?

200
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,476
Delta Burke, I do declare.

201
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:43,980
Now, shall we get
to the mystery?

202
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:45,277
I'll go.

203
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:51,251
"My name is Deborah Utante,
Deb for short."

204
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:54,457
That's clever.
Debutante.

205
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,124
"Bill Bourbon
was my uncle.

206
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:02,860
"I would have never hurt him any
more than I'd hurt a June bug."

207
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:05,266
Nice accent. You sound
like Forrest Gump.

208
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:06,395
I do not.

209
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:07,768
Well, you do, actually.

210
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,536
You got this kind of like
Florida Panhandle thing going,

211
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,807
whereas what you really want
is more of a Savannah accent,

212
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,872
which is more like molasses just
sort of spilling out of your mouth.

213
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,815
Oh, now do
the Swedish Chef.

214
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:23,217
I'm not familiar.
What province is he from?

215
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:26,086
He lives on Sesame Street,
dumb-ass.

216
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:28,591
You know, I think I'm supposed
to say something to Pam,

217
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,355
I mean, Deb. Okay.

218
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:36,801
"I overheard you asking the
butler where the pistol was kept."

219
00:10:36,868 --> 00:10:38,665
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

220
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:41,262
I'm the butler. What, you
were listening in on that?

221
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:42,738
Oh, you rich people,
you think you can do

222
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:44,365
whatever you want
to the servant class!

223
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:46,034
No, no, no. Don't turn
this into a political thing.

224
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:48,136
I will poison your food.

225
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:50,113
I reckon I got
something to say

226
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:52,843
to Miss Beatrix Bourbon,
if she don't mind.

227
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:56,080
Ooh, doggy!
We got a party now!

228
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:59,248
I do believe that
the game is a big hit.

229
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:01,155
People are really diving
into their characters.

230
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:02,919
Y'all...

231
00:11:09,968 --> 00:11:11,333
I made a mistake.

232
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:12,893
Sorry, I'm late, boss.
What's going on?

233
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:17,340
Sir, there has
been a murder, and you are a suspect.

234
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:21,175
Okay. Hang on just a second. Let me
settle in, and I'll be right back.

235
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:23,009
Very good! Very good!

236
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:26,414
Now, no one was there
in the wine cellar.

237
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:40,925
Hey there, young lady.

238
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,159
Hello.

239
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:46,727
I would be remiss if I did
not ask the pretty young lady

240
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:49,569
out on a date
for this weekend.

241
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:52,109
Sounds like a plan, sugar.

242
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:55,340
All right!
A plan it is.

243
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:04,150
Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your
dalliance with the dark arts.

244
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:07,191
It's not my fault. I was
exposed to Harry Potter.

245
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:08,790
I know you did it!

246
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,489
I know she didn't do it. It's
never the person you most suspect.

247
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:15,931
It's also never the
person you least suspect,

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,265
since anyone with half a brain
would suspect them the most.

249
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:23,330
Therefore, I know the
killer to be Phyllis,

250
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:30,342
a.k.a. Beatrix Bourbon, the
person I most medium suspect.

251
00:12:30,982 --> 00:12:34,543
Do you want to go out
on a date with me?

252
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:38,020
We can make out
by the horses.

253
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,490
Well, you know old Nellie is
always up for a romp in the hay.

254
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,687
How about
a threesome?

255
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,926
Yeah.
My boudoir's always open.

256
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,193
Nice.

257
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:53,500
I'm a little worried I might have
asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin.

258
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:54,731
Which would be a whole
lot less appealing,

259
00:12:54,806 --> 00:12:57,639
because Naughty Nellie
says yes to everyone,

260
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,609
and she might be
a murderer.

261
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:01,201
Follow before...

262
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,873
I just got an e-mail
from corporate,

263
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:06,917
specifically for Accounting, to
stop all payments to our vendors.

264
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:08,418
What does that mean?

265
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:10,852
Well, maybe nothing, but it could
be a problem with liquidity...

266
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:13,254
Whoa! What's this
strange Yankee accent

267
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:14,848
coming out of
your mouth, son?

268
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:16,951
This here is Savannah.

269
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:19,220
Phyllis...

270
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:23,266
This... Plan...

271
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:28,897
This plantation, we're
running low on greenbacks,

272
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:31,965
and we're having problems
paying the people

273
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:35,774
who give us the seeds and
the dirt. We can't pay them.

274
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:38,179
Michael, I can't...

275
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:41,548
Basically, it could mean a lot of
things, but it is unprecedented,

276
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:42,643
so it's cause for concern.

277
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,244
Okay, I'm going back
to work.

278
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:45,949
No. No, no, no.
No. No, no.

279
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:48,754
I'm gonna skip forward to a
really big clue. Here we go.

280
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:52,593
Well, by now, you figured out
that old Beatrix Bourbon was the killer.

281
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:53,756
What?

282
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:56,356
Michael, I was
doing so well.

283
00:13:56,434 --> 00:13:59,995
Are you going to believe
that? That is a...

284
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:01,663
That's a misdirection.

285
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,036
We still don't know
who the murderer is.

286
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,078
Nellie Nutmeg, come back in
here! I can't do this myself.

287
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,986
Voodoo Mama Juju.
What am I gonna do?

288
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:22,991
Okay, so corporate is
still in their meeting.

289
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:25,393
That could be
a good sign.

290
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:28,193
Hey, everyone, Kevin's gonna
give us his take on the situation.

291
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:29,631
Let's listen up.

292
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,896
All right, guys, it's a
workday, and you guys work here,

293
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,562
so let's go
do some work.

294
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:36,198
Now, Jim telling us
all to work,

295
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:38,606
I think that is
a very good sign.

296
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:40,268
Don't just say things.

297
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,744
Oh, good, Michael. Listen, I
wrote up those sales targets...

298
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:49,253
I do believe you have me
mistaken. My name is Caleb Crawdad.

299
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:53,824
Y'all skedaddled way too soon.
We need to reopen this case.

300
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:56,224
No, you're not re-opening
the case. The case is closed.

301
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:57,386
No, it ain't.

302
00:14:58,096 --> 00:14:59,927
Frankly,
I'm not surprised.

303
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:03,864
A lot of the evidence
seemed to be based on puns.

304
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:09,733
I was just thinking about
Weekend at Bernie's.

305
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:11,775
So funny. The guy's
dead the whole time.

306
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:13,743
I haven't seen it.

307
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:17,975
Speaking of weekends, you excited
about our date this weekend?

308
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:20,176
Of course, Nathaniel.

309
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:21,650
Okay.

310
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:23,584
Where are you taking me?

311
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:25,122
Well...

312
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,024
The finest
steakhouse in all Savannah.

313
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:31,994
Savannah? That's a far way
from Scranton.

314
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:35,256
Did you mean
a real date?

315
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,425
No.

316
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:38,893
Did you?

317
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,597
Totally not.

318
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:52,876
I thought
it was for real.

319
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:58,019
So I was excited, but
it was part of the game.

320
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:01,987
You're sure it was water?
It couldn't have been acid?

321
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,961
I already declared you,
it was too dark to tell!

322
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:06,223
Stop playing games
with me, Crawdad!

323
00:16:06,297 --> 00:16:08,561
This is not a game!
This is my life!

324
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:10,828
You are out of order, sir! Answer me!

325
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:13,336
You are out of order!
You are out of order!

326
00:16:13,404 --> 00:16:15,872
I think Michael
may have snapped.

327
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,567
Or maybe he's just
stuck in character.

328
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:20,543
Well, which is worse?
Snapped or stuck?

329
00:16:20,611 --> 00:16:22,772
Both.
They're both worse.

330
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:28,116
It's gonna be all right.
We're a good company.

331
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:31,417
We'll figure this out.
We're not going under.

332
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:34,253
Jim, what if we both
lose our jobs?

333
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:37,687
I'm trying to think of a way
that this all ends up fine,

334
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:39,627
and I can't
think of one.

335
00:16:41,165 --> 00:16:44,794
Deb, what in the world?
Do you have the vapors?

336
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:46,461
Michael! Not now.
Can't wait.

337
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:49,199
We have to get you to our
witch doctor right now.

338
00:16:49,273 --> 00:16:51,207
Come on, come on!

339
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:52,708
I should just go.

340
00:16:53,277 --> 00:16:54,744
Where to now, Caleb?

341
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:58,009
To Mama Juju Booboo.

342
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:00,849
Michael, can I...

343
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:04,949
Okay, I'm just gonna skip right
past the what and go with why?

344
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,789
Because this is the
recreation of a crime scene.

345
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,885
I'm the dead body, and
these are my brain chunks.

346
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:12,020
Hey, shut up.
You're dead.

347
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:13,324
Michael, can I talk
to you in your office?

348
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:15,423
No Michael here. My name is... Caleb!

349
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:24,807
Today, of all days?
No! You shut up!

350
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:27,208
They need this game, Jim.

351
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:29,803
Let us have this stupid
little game, all right?

352
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:35,844
Oh, you startled me!

353
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,686
My stars, my heart nearly
leapt out of my chest.

354
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:40,985
What can I do you for?

355
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,653
Wallace is on the phone.
He's returning your call.

356
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:45,195
Detective Wallace?

357
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:48,596
I don't think so. I think it's
David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.

358
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,328
Oh, shucks!
Tell him I'm not here.

359
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:52,460
You're not gonna
answer the phone?

360
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:55,199
No, I only answer
to Detective Wallace,

361
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:57,639
'cause I got a warm body
in the other room.

362
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,136
I'll take it.

363
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:01,542
Hey, David.

364
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:04,638
Hey. Sorry to be getting
back to you guys so late.

365
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:05,841
Things are still
a bit unclear.

366
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:08,078
We didn't officially
decide anything yet.

367
00:18:08,152 --> 00:18:09,813
Oh, okay.

368
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:12,913
But if I can be candid with
you here, Jim, it's not good.

369
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,550
We fully expect to be out of
money by the end of the year.

370
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:16,957
Insolvent.

371
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:22,423
So, well, you know what?
I'm sorry. I have to run.

372
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,558
But we will talk soon, okay? Sure.

373
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:26,102
Okay. Oh, you know, while I have you,

374
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,536
today I was working on this
pitch for a supermarket chain...

375
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:31,200
Great... and it would
actually be a big account.

376
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:32,537
Okay, look,
you know what?

377
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,339
I can't really get my
head around anything

378
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:35,970
like that right now,
but that's great.

379
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:37,844
Keep after it,
but I gotta run.

380
00:18:37,915 --> 00:18:38,939
Okay.
Thanks, Jim.

381
00:18:39,016 --> 00:18:40,005
See you.

382
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:52,324
What's the news?

383
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:53,829
Nothing yet.

384
00:18:57,735 --> 00:18:59,396
Well, I guess
that's not...

385
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,234
Well, there is
some bad news.

386
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,105
There has been
another murder.

387
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:11,081
A murder, you say?

388
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:14,478
I do declare.

389
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:16,543
Conference room, everyone.

390
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:18,652
Do we have to play?

391
00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:20,657
No.
Super.

392
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:22,989
Oh, this could be
a juicy one.

393
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,255
Get in there!
Get in there!

394
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:28,394
I think today was a
good day to have two managers,

395
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:32,027
because if you're a family stuck on
a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean,

396
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:34,697
one parent might want
to just keep rowing.

397
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:37,707
But if the other parent
wants to play a game,

398
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:39,470
it's not because
they're crazy.

399
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:43,446
It's because they're doing it
for the kids. And I get that now.

400
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:49,075
There has been
a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue.

401
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:52,213
My little heart can
barely take it no more.

402
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,393
Today is the hardest
I have worked in a long, long time.

403
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:03,390
I didn't do it!
Okay.

404
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:06,527
Everybody just calm down. I am calm.

405
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:09,630
Count of three, we're all
gonna put down our guns.

406
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:11,971
I have crossbows.

407
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:14,637
We'll put down our weaponry
on the count of three.

408
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:15,770
Okay.

409
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:17,211
You ready?
- I'm ready.

410
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:19,545
One, two...

411
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:20,606
Two.

412
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,277
Three.
Three.

413
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:27,384
Andy revealed himself
to be a double agent,

414
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,426
at which point,
Dwight felt comfortable

415
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:31,427
revealing that he also
was a double agent,

416
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:34,396
and then, Michael
announced to everybody that,

417
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:37,093
get this,
he was a double agent.

418
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:39,965
Oh, and it is 6:00.

419
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:50,940
Really?

420
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:54,781
It wasn't me! I'm not
going down for this!

421
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:56,820
Hey, I want
to go home.

422
00:20:56,887 --> 00:20:59,151
Get the keys out of my
purse, start the car.
