1
00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:05,670
You wanted to see me?
Yeah, have a seat.

2
00:00:05,738 --> 00:00:07,228
Is it serious?

3
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,935
Wow. Andy's
a little scared.

4
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,137
Okay, right there.

5
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:16,376
Right there's the problem.

6
00:00:16,448 --> 00:00:18,882
There have been reports
around the office

7
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:22,512
that you have been
talking baby talk.

8
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:23,646
Why would people
say that?

9
00:00:23,722 --> 00:00:29,092
Well, I have it on good authority
that you said the following.

10
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:30,953
Can you read that
back to me?

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,055
"Andy have a boo-boo
tummy." Mmm-hmm.

12
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:35,766
Would you rather me say,

13
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:39,793
"Hey, guys, my irritable
bowel syndrome is flaring up."

14
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:42,102
Okay. "Crazy diarrhea
happening right now."

15
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:43,903
'Cause things can get
real adult real fast.

16
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:45,807
You are also on
record as saying,

17
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:48,108
"Wittle-ittle,
footie-wooties, num-nums,

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,082
"jammies, make boom-boom,
widiciwus, and Whode Island."

19
00:00:52,918 --> 00:00:55,352
Do I sometimes
replace Rs with Ws?

20
00:00:55,487 --> 00:00:57,455
Do I sometimes repeat a
word to get my point across?

21
00:00:57,523 --> 00:01:00,583
Well, if I do,
Andy's sowwy.

22
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:03,651
You can't be a baby
in the office.

23
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:06,391
It makes me look
like I hire babies.

24
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:07,557
Well, if we're
complaining,

25
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:09,567
a lot of people think your
Elvis voice is annoying.

26
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:10,795
Okay. Who said that?

27
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:12,029
Just people.

28
00:01:12,104 --> 00:01:15,073
For the record, I think
it's pretty fantastic.

29
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,165
Thank you.
Thank you a lot.

30
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,903
And for what it's worth, I
think your baby voice is tops.

31
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:21,969
Tank you, Mr. Elvis.

32
00:01:22,047 --> 00:01:23,275
You're welcome, baby.

33
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,170
Dr. Tuna M.D., I have
some terrible news.

34
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:51,641
Wait, are you the patient
or the doctor?

35
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,507
The entire office
has come down

36
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,241
with a pernicious
case of the Mondays.

37
00:01:56,682 --> 00:01:58,206
Wow. What do you put
our chances at?

38
00:01:58,283 --> 00:01:59,477
0%.

39
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:04,352
Unless we perform an immediate
emergency morale transplant, stat!

40
00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:06,181
Sounds risky.

41
00:02:06,258 --> 00:02:08,590
Don't worry.
There is a surefire cure.

42
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:13,296
Employee of the Month. Every
awesome place I've worked had one.

43
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:17,959
Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers,
AIG, my summer at Enron.

44
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:21,034
Wow. That's not such a bad idea. Great.

45
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:22,903
Anything else?
Nope.

46
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:28,137
"Frankie's Dirty Joke
of the Day."

47
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:29,805
There's a bunch of those.
Keep.

48
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:32,407
There's a bunch of sent emails
that just say "delivered."

49
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:33,576
Should I delete those?

50
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:36,120
I want to keep those
so I can see what I sent.

51
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:37,348
That's why you have
a sent mail folder.

52
00:02:37,422 --> 00:02:38,480
Keep.

53
00:02:38,557 --> 00:02:41,526
There's about three news
alerts from Nip Slip.

54
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:43,390
For what?
Nip Slip.

55
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:45,589
Okay. I don't know
how those get on there.

56
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:46,722
Well...

57
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:48,493
Must be hackers.

58
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:50,694
Hey, what's up?

59
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:54,268
What if I told you I had
done the worst thing ever?

60
00:02:54,339 --> 00:02:55,704
Would you still want
to be my friend?

61
00:02:55,774 --> 00:02:56,968
Did you murder someone?

62
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,100
Worse than murder.

63
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,337
Oh, my God.

64
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:01,109
Lurk much?

65
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:04,313
I miss Pam.

66
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:08,376
I think she's okay.

67
00:03:08,453 --> 00:03:11,115
Is that what we're
going for now? "Okay"?

68
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,885
We used to go
for "pretty good."

69
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,016
Great.

70
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:15,559
Hey, how do you feel
about starting

71
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:17,060
an Employee of
the Month program?

72
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,530
Yeah. You know what, that
actually might make me feel better.

73
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,896
I'm not in this for
the trophies, but...

74
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:22,991
You're not in it at all

75
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:24,933
'cause you can't be Employee
of the Month. You're a manager.

76
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:26,527
Well, technically
I am a co-manager

77
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:28,436
and I barely have
any responsibilities.

78
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:30,873
All right. Yeah. But I work
hard, I love this company,

79
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:33,411
and for those reasons I think I would
make a good Employee of the Month.

80
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:34,604
It would look bad. Sorry.

81
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,046
It would look good
on my mantle.

82
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:39,583
Jim's talking to
Michael right now.

83
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:41,516
They totally
went for our idea!

84
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:44,112
Yeah! Your idea.

85
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:45,451
My idea.

86
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,452
I just need Andy to
think it's his idea

87
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:50,290
so it won't get
traced back to me.

88
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:55,232
In approximately six hours Jim will
get a phone call from David Wallace.

89
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,132
He will be fired.

90
00:03:57,402 --> 00:04:00,963
Hey, Pam, do you have a sec
to check over this itinerary?

91
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:03,163
Looks great.

92
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:06,143
Did you really look it over?
Felt like maybe you didn't.

93
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:07,337
Okay.

94
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:11,708
The Michael Scott Foundation
is still in existence.

95
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:14,650
There you are. I don't think
we have finished with my inbox.

96
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,585
What's "Scott's Tots"?

97
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:24,321
Has it really
been 10 years?

98
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:36,166
Michael, why did you
promise that?

99
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:37,503
To change lives.

100
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:40,443
No. Michael, why would you promise that?

101
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:42,104
You know...
Okay. I can't...

102
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:44,679
Call the school, cancel.
I can't go through with this.

103
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,650
We've already rescheduled seven times.

104
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:50,279
Michael, this is a terrible,
terrible thing you've done.

105
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:51,379
Well...

106
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:54,550
It's terrible.
Just terrible.

107
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:57,627
And the longer you put it
off, the worse it's gonna get.

108
00:04:57,763 --> 00:05:00,357
I just... I fell in
love with these kids,

109
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:03,230
and I didn't want to see them
fall victim to the system.

110
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:04,360
So I made them
a promise.

111
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:07,337
I told them that if they
graduated from high school,

112
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:10,500
I would pay for their
college education.

113
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:14,170
I have made some empty
promises in my life,

114
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:16,771
but hands down, that
was the most generous.

115
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:19,110
Just tell me it is going
to be okay, all right?

116
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:20,208
No!

117
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:23,118
I'm not a bad-news person.
I bring good news,

118
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:25,520
like when I promised those
kids I'd pay for college.

119
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:29,024
Okay. All right.

120
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:30,425
You have to tell them.

121
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:35,265
Would you come with me? You know,
like old times? Instead of...

122
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:39,871
I can print out a new
itinerary with Pam's name on it.

123
00:05:40,372 --> 00:05:42,306
It's fine.
Erin, you're gonna go,

124
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:44,239
and you're gonna make sure
Michael tells the truth.

125
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:47,335
Oh, God. You know what?
Could this day get any worse?

126
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:51,009
Hey, Jimmy, what's up?

127
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,141
Not much.

128
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:55,380
Cool. Very cool.
I bet if you tried,

129
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:58,988
you could grow the best beard
of anyone in this office.

130
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:00,217
Thanks, Dwight.

131
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:01,691
That laugh is
so infectious.

132
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,024
You're creeping me out.
I'm gonna go.

133
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:06,326
I didn't mean any of
those things I just said.

134
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:09,993
And you can expect the same
thing from everyone in this office

135
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:13,367
if you don't nip this whole Employee
of the Month situation in the bud.

136
00:06:13,438 --> 00:06:15,668
Make it about
the work.

137
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:17,606
Let me guess. You
think you should get it.

138
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,236
This encompasses
all available data.

139
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,880
Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed
sick days, participation.

140
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:28,712
Everyone has been assigned
a random number

141
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:31,415
for total fairness
and transparency.

142
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:34,451
Also, this should be
accompanied by a monetary prize.

143
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:36,221
Well, in an ideal
world... In an ideal world

144
00:06:36,294 --> 00:06:38,023
I would have all 10
fingers on my left hand,

145
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:40,030
so my right hand could
just be a fist for punching.

146
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:41,497
Okay. If it's all
the same to you,

147
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:44,330
I'm just gonna take away
survival skills and self-defense.

148
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,598
I'm gonna run this
by Toby and Accounting

149
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:48,161
and have them
assemble the data.

150
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,140
It's okay,
I'll do it.

151
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,810
Mr. Scott?

152
00:06:56,982 --> 00:07:00,042
Hey! Mikela Lasker!
How are you?

153
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:01,142
I'm good.

154
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:02,447
Good to see you.
Where's your saxophone?

155
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,113
It's in the music room,
Mr. Scott.

156
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:06,157
Eighth-grade graduation,
she gave a rendition

157
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:08,852
of When the Saints Go Marching In
that would blow your freaking mind.

158
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:09,916
Wow.

159
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:11,019
Well, you didn't
even hear it.

160
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,121
Everyone's so excited
that you're here today.

161
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:14,187
Oh, good.
Now,

162
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:16,166
I know you probably
want to see everyone,

163
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:18,498
but I was wondering if I could
ask you some questions first.

164
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,969
Sure.
You're famous.

165
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:22,370
I'm sure you remember
this place. Oh, yeah.

166
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:23,465
Do you want to go in?

167
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:24,770
No, not at all.
Nope. Come on.

168
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:29,241
You know what? You know,
I shouldn't go in there.

169
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:30,576
I'm pretty busy.
I shouldn't...

170
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:33,117
We just want
to say thanks.

171
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:41,586
Mr. Scott!
Mr. Scott! Mr. Scott!

172
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,649
Mr. Scott!

173
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:45,962
Mr. Scott,
I know you're a busy man

174
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:47,862
and your schedule
moves around a lot,

175
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:51,728
but for all your generosity
through the years, your tots,

176
00:07:52,103 --> 00:07:53,627
who are ready
to graduate,

177
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:56,970
thought it was time to
give you a proper thank you.

178
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:06,682
Hey, Mr. Scott,
what you gonna do

179
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:09,219
What you gonna do
Make our dreams come true

180
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:11,755
Hey, Mr. Scott,
what you gonna do

181
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:14,121
What you gonna do
Make our dreams come true

182
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:17,025
You came into our lives and made
a promise That made us honest

183
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:20,030
Made us realize
We don't need to compromise

184
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:21,656
'Cause we can have it all

185
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:26,067
'Cause you made it possible
For us to achieve the improbable

186
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:29,265
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

187
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,741
Hey, Mr. Scott,
what you gonna do

188
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,802
What you gonna do
Make our dreams come true

189
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,738
Wow!

190
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,048
Hey. So Jim thought
it would be ideal...

191
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:51,459
Hey.
...if we all pitched in...

192
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:53,253
So, Jim thought
it would be ideal

193
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:57,267
if we all pitched in a 20 for this
whole Employee of the Month thing.

194
00:08:57,335 --> 00:08:58,495
Jim said that?

195
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,562
He thought you were doing
an incredible job last month.

196
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,073
Jim said that?

197
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:04,267
You seem surprised.

198
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:06,974
No, no, that makes
total sense.

199
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:14,751
Hey, buddy.
So everyone...

200
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:21,248
Five minutes ahead of
schedule. Right on schedule.

201
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:23,918
Politicians are
always coming around,

202
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:28,056
telling us they're gonna fix our
schools, promising this and that.

203
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,066
But you, Mr. Scott,
you are actually doing it!

204
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:37,671
You have taught these kids, with
hard work, that anything is possible.

205
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:41,409
You are a dream maker,
and I thank you.

206
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:46,110
I thank you. I thank you,
I thank you, I thank you.

207
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:53,218
There were a lot of
times over the years

208
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,384
where I was pressured
to get into the drug game.

209
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,452
But I always thought back
to my guardian angel

210
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:00,793
and the gift
that you gave me.

211
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:03,834
So I just want to thank you
for giving me the opportunity

212
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:06,302
to go to college,
educate myself,

213
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:08,532
and become
the next President Obama.

214
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,336
Oh, God.

215
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:17,982
Okay, ladies and
gentlemen, welcome.

216
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:21,382
I know you're all very excited,
but no matter who gets this,

217
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:23,318
I just want to say
that you guys are all

218
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:24,912
Employees of the Month
in my eyes.

219
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:30,592
And the winner is employee
number nine, and that is...

220
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:35,456
Number nine,
number nine, Jim Halpert.

221
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:36,659
- What?
- What?

222
00:10:36,735 --> 00:10:38,669
Are you kidding me?
Oh, no.

223
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:41,205
Okay, wait.
I was not...

224
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:44,036
I did not get...

225
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:46,737
"I did not...
That was not...

226
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
"How come not..."

227
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,872
Guys, listen.

228
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:51,472
This was anonymous,
all right?

229
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:53,244
There's no way I could
have given it to myself,

230
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:55,513
because I didn't even know
who was on here.

231
00:10:55,587 --> 00:10:57,680
I just gave it to the employee
with the highest overall score.

232
00:10:57,756 --> 00:11:00,657
To my tally, you just won
back your own parking spot,

233
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:04,559
a vacation day, and a nice tidy
quarter of $1,000 from all of us.

234
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:06,096
Will everybody just
stop for a second?

235
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:07,722
'Cause obviously I'm
not taking any of it.

236
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,790
A mistake has been made
and we'll figure it out.

237
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:11,460
Second of all,
there was no cash prize.

238
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:12,560
Yes!

239
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:13,865
Dwight?
Yeah, you said,

240
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:15,633
"In an ideal world, there
would be a cash prize."

241
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:17,607
Isn't that what you
said? No, Dwight, I meant,

242
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:20,338
yes, in a perfect world, someone
would get money, but not...

243
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:23,745
Yeah, but, in your perfect
world, only you get money.

244
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:25,510
- Yeah, that's...
- Don't do this...

245
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,517
I know, all right? Don't do...

246
00:11:27,585 --> 00:11:30,713
Let's put your hands together
and give a warm welcome

247
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:33,690
for the man of the hour,
Mr. Michael Scott.

248
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,361
Thank you.

249
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:46,167
All right. Wow.

250
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:51,338
I am never going to
forget today. Not a chance.

251
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:55,835
I don't think I could ever give back
to you what you have given me today.

252
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:58,678
Who here's done something
stupid in their lives?

253
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,843
Like skipped out
on study hall

254
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,978
or mix up the difference
between A gym and B gym,

255
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:04,453
that sort of thing?
Show of hands.

256
00:12:04,522 --> 00:12:07,013
Anybody? Yes,
a bunch of you. Okay.

257
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:11,461
Well, me, too. I've done something
stupid, which I would like to share.

258
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,856
Um...

259
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,126
Should we go?

260
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:19,568
No, no, we're okay.
It's a double period.

261
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,707
All right. I came here today
because I promised you tuition,

262
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,939
and tuition is
very valuable.

263
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:29,741
But you know
what's invaluable?

264
00:12:29,814 --> 00:12:32,078
Is intuition.
You know what that is?

265
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:36,518
That is the ability to know when
something is about to happen.

266
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:40,180
Does anybody out there
have intuition?

267
00:12:40,258 --> 00:12:42,351
Know what's gonna
happen next?

268
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:45,225
Nobody? Okay. You're
gonna make me say it.

269
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,589
All right. I am so proud of all of you.

270
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:55,270
Derrick and Lefervre
and Ben and Ayana

271
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,436
and Mikela and Nikki
and Jason and...

272
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:02,403
I'm sorry, okay, I'm
sort of spacing your name.

273
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,573
I'm Zion. I'm Mikela's younger brother.

274
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,311
Well, Zion, I am not going
to be paying for your tuition.

275
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:12,489
Which brings me
to my main point,

276
00:13:12,557 --> 00:13:16,288
and that is that I will not be
able to pay for anybody's tuition.

277
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:20,323
I'm so, so sorry.

278
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:24,225
- What?
- You're kidding.

279
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:25,633
Excuse me?

280
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:32,473
I'm sorry.

281
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,337
Explain yourself, sir!

282
00:13:36,414 --> 00:13:38,382
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

283
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:39,740
I'm so sorry.

284
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:40,944
You lied to us.

285
00:13:41,753 --> 00:13:45,814
Yep. I lied to myself, too.
I'm not a millionaire.

286
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:50,022
I thought I would be by the time
I was 30, but I wasn't even close,

287
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:52,460
and then I thought maybe
by the time I was 40,

288
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,397
but by 40 I had less
money than when I was 30.

289
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:57,093
Maybe by my 50s,
I don't know.

290
00:13:57,168 --> 00:14:00,296
I wanted to pay
for your education.

291
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:04,174
I really did.
It was my dream.

292
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:08,912
Some people have evil dreams,
some people have selfish dreams,

293
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:12,082
or wet dreams. My dream
was in the right place.

294
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,549
You owe this to us.

295
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:15,415
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

296
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:19,714
Now, I can't pay
for your college,

297
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:24,751
but you don't have to go
to class to be in class.

298
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:28,865
Online courses
are a viable option

299
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:30,924
to a traditional
college experience,

300
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:33,600
and the best way to
access those courses

301
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:36,731
is with your own
personal laptop,

302
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:41,039
which is rendered
useless without batteries,

303
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:42,636
and I have one
for each of you.

304
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:51,986
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold
on, hold on. They're lithium.

305
00:14:56,828 --> 00:15:00,855
Look, there was a big mistake,
obviously, so I will fix it. Okay?

306
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,061
This was
your idea anyway.

307
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:05,967
Correction.
It was my idea.

308
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:07,129
Okay.

309
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:08,566
My idea.

310
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:11,601
Guys, I'm starting to think
Pam's not even pregnant.

311
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:14,907
Okay, for the record,
I am pregnant,

312
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:17,573
and obviously there's been
some kind of a mistake,

313
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:21,483
so why doesn't Jim just pick the
next highest score on the list

314
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:22,917
and we'll move on.

315
00:15:22,987 --> 00:15:24,511
Yeah, okay.
That's fair.

316
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:26,557
Excellent idea, Pam.
Thank you.

317
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:30,651
That would be employee
number three, which is...

318
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:32,453
Son of a bitch!

319
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,160
Pam Halpert.
- What?

320
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:37,865
How is that possible?

321
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:40,996
No offense, Pam, but how
the hell is that possible?

322
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:44,404
There must be some reasonable
explanation for this.

323
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:47,239
Wait, come on.
I didn't miss a day,

324
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:49,109
I came in early,
I stayed late,

325
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:51,111
and I doubled my
sales last month.

326
00:15:51,182 --> 00:15:53,343
Oh, really? From what? Two to four?

327
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:54,476
Yep.

328
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:57,486
Guys, this isn't some
elaborate scam, okay?

329
00:15:57,822 --> 00:16:01,349
Hi, I have an order here for
a custom cake. Jim Halpert.

330
00:16:01,592 --> 00:16:04,925
Okay. That is me, but
I didn't order the cake.

331
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,893
Look who it is.

332
00:16:11,202 --> 00:16:12,669
He knew all along.

333
00:16:12,737 --> 00:16:14,102
I'm gonna
have some cake.

334
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:15,264
David Wallace's office.

335
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,309
This is Kevin Malone.
Is David there?

336
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,605
No, he's in his weekly staff
meeting. Can I take a message?

337
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:27,914
Tell him I'm mad at Jim 'cause
he's asking us to give money to Pam.

338
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:33,622
This is Stanley Hudson.
Jim Halpert is a menace.

339
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:38,958
It's Toby Flenderson. Listen, things
are getting really bad down here.

340
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:45,726
Hey, Mr. Scott.

341
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:51,004
Erin, can you
give us a second?

342
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:52,968
That was messed up
what you did.

343
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:54,568
Yeah, yeah,
I know. I know.

344
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:55,873
I know, I'm sorry.

345
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:57,642
Who does something
like that?

346
00:16:57,715 --> 00:16:59,512
Who promises that
to a bunch of kids

347
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:02,519
and then just doesn't
come through like that?

348
00:17:03,788 --> 00:17:04,880
What can I do?

349
00:17:04,956 --> 00:17:06,548
You could pay
for my college.

350
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:10,458
I can give you an extra laptop
battery. Not everyone took one.

351
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:16,290
How about this?

352
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:22,031
If you can find a way to pay for your
tuition, let me buy your books, okay?

353
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:23,164
They're expensive.

354
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:26,210
Yeah, well, I owe you
that at least, right?

355
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:28,011
It's about $1,000.

356
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,138
Really? Wow.

357
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,781
That's over $200 a year.

358
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,750
No, $1,000 each year.

359
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:37,481
For... Okay. Okay.

360
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:42,684
Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna
write four checks for $1,000 each.

361
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,921
I'm going to date them
one year apart.

362
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:47,089
Now, you are to use
one check a year,

363
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:49,326
and please call me
before you cash the check,

364
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,630
'cause I've got monies to
move around. Yeah, yeah.

365
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:54,193
Okay? Make it out to my Aunt Rosa.

366
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:57,073
That's a lot of zeroes.

367
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,102
This is Jim.

368
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:02,510
Jim, what the hell
is happening there?

369
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,571
Hey, David.
Yes?

370
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:08,010
So, there was a little bit of
a miscommunication here today.

371
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:10,714
It's been a little wild,
but I am on it.

372
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:13,848
Just so I understand, you
started Employee of the Month,

373
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:15,415
give it to yourself,

374
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:17,757
then people complain, so
you give it to your wife?

375
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:19,228
No.
Am I missing something?

376
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:20,958
I really don't know
how it happened, David.

377
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:22,932
I know how it happened.

378
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:33,036
Jim, I bumped you up because I
thought you could make my life easier.

379
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:36,877
If you can't do that, we're
gonna have a separate discussion.

380
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:40,042
All right, it will
not happen again. I promise.

381
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:44,611
I am sorry. I am taking this out on you.

382
00:18:46,257 --> 00:18:47,485
No. But things have been crazy here.

383
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:49,651
You know I think you're
doing a great job, right?

384
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,059
What? No.
Yeah. Thank you.

385
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:55,757
Okay. We still
on for dinner this weekend?

386
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,095
What?
Yes.

387
00:18:57,168 --> 00:18:59,659
Okay. See you.
You're kidding me!

388
00:19:00,104 --> 00:19:01,332
Damn it!

389
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,665
Hey, Mr. Scott,
what you gonna do

390
00:19:04,742 --> 00:19:07,370
What you gonna do
Make our dreams come true

391
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:10,141
Hey, Mr. Scott,
what you gonna do

392
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:11,613
Please stop.

393
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:15,517
Fifteen lives.

394
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:19,181
I destroyed
15 young lives today.

395
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:20,724
No.
Yes.

396
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,984
No, there's
financial aid.

397
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:28,257
They could join
the Army or the Navy.

398
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:30,698
Maybe...
You're, what, like, 12?

399
00:19:35,673 --> 00:19:37,937
The principal
told me that

400
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:40,705
90% of Scott's Tots are
on track to graduate,

401
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:43,975
and that's 35% higher
than the rest of the school,

402
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,077
so I think that if you
hadn't made that promise,

403
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:49,585
a lot of them
would have dropped out,

404
00:19:49,654 --> 00:19:52,020
which is something to
think about, I think.

405
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:03,731
I think you're
doing a great job.

406
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:05,732
Really?

407
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:09,933
What do you want
from this job,

408
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:13,272
provided the company
doesn't go out of business?

409
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:16,074
Well, I've always wondered what it
might be like to be an accountant.

410
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:17,205
Really?

411
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:18,646
Yes, but I'm
terrible at math.

412
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:21,344
Well, you know,
when I hired Kevin,

413
00:20:21,852 --> 00:20:25,151
he was actually applying
for a job in the warehouse.

414
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,317
Seriously?
Yeah.

415
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:30,621
I just sort of had
a feeling about him.

416
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,660
Have a feeling
about you, too.

417
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:40,532
Hey, Mr. Scott,
what you gonna do

418
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:43,540
What you gonna do
Make our dreams come true

419
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:46,475
Hey, Mr. Scott,
what you gonna do

420
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:48,978
What you gonna do
Make our dreams come true

421
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:50,035
Yeah!

422
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:55,575
See you
tomorrow, Dwight.

423
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:57,052
Apparently.

424
00:20:57,922 --> 00:21:00,720
How's it going? Good day? Not now, temp.

425
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:06,555
Okay. So, listen, I know
about your diabolical plan.

426
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:13,227
What? Diabolical plan? I
wouldn't even know how to begin...

427
00:21:13,971 --> 00:21:16,735
I found a copy of it
in the copier tray.

428
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:18,502
So what do you want?

429
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:20,237
I want the same thing
you want.

430
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:23,906
I want to take Jim
Halpert down. I want in.
