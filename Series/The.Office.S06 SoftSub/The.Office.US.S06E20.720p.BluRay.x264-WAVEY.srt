1
00:00:03,168 --> 00:00:05,159
Hey, Jim.
Jim! Come here.

2
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:07,761
Do you know who that is?

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,864
No.

4
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:10,067
Look at him.
Look at him.

5
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:11,166
T-shirt, jeans.

6
00:00:11,243 --> 00:00:13,677
Is it you?
I am flattered.

7
00:00:14,947 --> 00:00:16,073
That's Johnny Depp.

8
00:00:16,148 --> 00:00:18,878
Where'd you take that?
In my condo complex.

9
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:21,249
Oh, my God, that's right!
I read in People magazine

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,447
that he was looking for a
two-bedroom condo in Scranton.

11
00:00:23,522 --> 00:00:24,955
I'm flipping out, man.

12
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,787
Well, you remember my idea
for the fourth Pirates movie.

13
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:28,053
Sure. That they should do one.

14
00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:32,655
Hey, Jim, Jim, where do
I find the Black Pearl?

15
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:34,824
Who's that?
Captain Jack Sparrow.

16
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,697
Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.

17
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:38,293
John Dillinger.

18
00:00:39,304 --> 00:00:41,067
No, I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

19
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,607
Cap'n Crunch.

20
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:44,606
Okay. Okay.

21
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:46,708
Screw you, Halpert.

22
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:50,078
You know, it's not easy
getting excited about stuff.

23
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:52,477
Remember how you felt when you
thought you'd seen Roger Clemens?

24
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:53,540
At the Yankees game.

25
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:54,847
Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.

26
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,354
I had a little better
reason to believe that...

27
00:00:58,357 --> 00:00:59,949
You're right.
You're right.

28
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:02,523
Well, you're not right,
because Johnny Depp...

29
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:04,721
I know. I know!
...in your condo complex?

30
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:08,597
It also explains why the name
on his mailbox was M. Schulman.

31
00:01:12,237 --> 00:01:13,864
M. Night Schulman?

32
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:38,260
First up,

33
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,060
the Lost and Found has
gone missing.

34
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:42,896
It itself is lost,

35
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:45,869
so please try not to lose
anything until we find it.

36
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:48,498
Pet day. If you don't
have a pet please don't feel like...

37
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:50,872
When are we
getting to sales topics?

38
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:53,411
Yeah. What about those leads? Did
you hear anything from corporate?

39
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,413
Ah, yes, the leads.

40
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:57,745
The leads that
Sabre has spent $50,000

41
00:01:57,816 --> 00:02:01,582
to get from a market research
company are not here yet.

42
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:02,950
- Man.
- But will be...

43
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:05,546
Damn it! No, no,
no. No. Meeting's not over.

44
00:02:05,624 --> 00:02:07,990
But is there anything relevant
to the sales staff here?

45
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,857
No sales topic, per se.

46
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:12,829
Well, then
no Andy Bernard, per se.

47
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:14,297
I agree.

48
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:16,493
Dwight? Sorry. Michael,
I got calls to make.

49
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:18,536
I would like your
undivided attention, please.

50
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:21,038
You couldn't handle
my undivided attention.

51
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,874
Over the last few weeks,
things have been changing here.

52
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:30,545
Sabre says it is our duty
to support the sales team,

53
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:33,210
and the salesmen are
letting it go to their heads.

54
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:34,946
I think it's kind of
screwed up,

55
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,681
because the way
this place used to work

56
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:39,952
was make friends first,
make sales second,

57
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:42,822
make love third,
in no particular order.

58
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:48,463
Listen, Michael,

59
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,634
about what
happened earlier.

60
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:51,930
Yeah?

61
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:53,699
When I was asking about
the leads.

62
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:54,932
Mmm-hmm.

63
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,634
Is there any news
on the leads?

64
00:02:57,809 --> 00:02:58,901
Is that all you have to say to me?

65
00:02:58,977 --> 00:03:01,639
Yeah. You got any
news on the leads?

66
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:03,370
Okay, I tell you what.

67
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:05,609
I'm going out on a very
important sales call.

68
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:08,050
You get any news about
the leads, you try me.

69
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,680
All of my numbers.
All six of my numbers, okay?

70
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:12,724
Including the car phone!

71
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:15,925
All right, Dwight out!

72
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:17,621
Salesman is King.

73
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:20,392
As the best salesman,
I am King of Kings.

74
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,726
Oh, you say Jesus
is King of Kings?

75
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:27,533
Well, what does that say to
you about how I think of myself?

76
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:34,876
Do you not
answer emails anymore?

77
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:38,781
Because I have emailed you four
times asking you to come to my desk.

78
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,841
Honey, if I don't have
time to answer an email,

79
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,150
I definitely don't have time
to walk over to your desk.

80
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,054
Wow, wowie, wowie.

81
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:48,992
Congratulations.
It's a big check.

82
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:51,824
Oh, sorry, one second.

83
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,330
Stop sexting Pam.

84
00:03:53,398 --> 00:03:54,660
I'm trying to
congratulate you.

85
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:58,134
This is actually a big
potential sale, so...

86
00:03:58,203 --> 00:03:59,932
You're writing your
memoirs over there?

87
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:01,370
You writing your
name over there?

88
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,600
Well, it's a pretty big check.

89
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:04,403
It's good, you know,
with the kid.

90
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:06,740
Okay. Don't gloat.
Here's the thing.

91
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:09,042
This kind of money
can corrupt people.

92
00:04:09,314 --> 00:04:11,282
All right,
here we go. "Michael."

93
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,647
I'm just
saying that...

94
00:04:12,718 --> 00:04:13,844
"Michael."

95
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:17,479
Great.

96
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:20,616
Teddy, nice. Let me just... Let
me write that down real quick.

97
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:22,853
Pencil. Give me a pencil.

98
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,122
Hang on, Teddy.
I'm making a sale.

99
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,428
Mmm-hmm.
Sales.

100
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:30,525
Mmm-hmm.

101
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:31,830
There's other pencils
in this office.

102
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:33,234
Give me...

103
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:48,444
Honey and jelly
sandwich time.

104
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,748
Mike.

105
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:51,880
Oh, you gotta
be kidding me.

106
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:53,424
Look at that. That's...

107
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:54,686
I know who did that.

108
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,661
You saw who did
this and you didn't stop them?

109
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:00,254
Didn't have to see.
It was sales, I can feel it.

110
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:02,495
They are out of control.

111
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:04,765
The sales department
smashed my sandwich.

112
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:06,895
Yes. All of them.

113
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:08,837
Together.
It's a conspiracy.

114
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:10,697
Listen to me, Mike.

115
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:12,835
You gotta do
something about them.

116
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:13,935
You don't get it.

117
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:16,537
You need to get back on top.

118
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:19,447
That's what she said.
That's what she said.

119
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:20,917
Yeah.
Yeah.

120
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:24,853
Something came
for you, Michael.

121
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:26,049
Thank you very much.

122
00:05:26,124 --> 00:05:27,523
What'd you get?

123
00:05:27,592 --> 00:05:29,457
- Uh, it's just the stupid leads.
- All right!

124
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:31,428
About time.
Yeah! Me likey!

125
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:34,363
Yeah, finally, Michael.
Hand them over, numbnuts.

126
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:38,700
But seriously, I mean, it's
your job to give us those leads.

127
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,101
All right.

128
00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:43,507
Then I guess I should
give them out. Hold on.

129
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:47,142
You know what I'm thinking?

130
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:49,612
I'm thinking that I have
something that you want.

131
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:51,979
You guys are acting
like you own this place,

132
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,244
and you don't.

133
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:56,185
Not even Sabre owns
this place. It's a rental.

134
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:58,017
I'm kind of sick of
the attitude around here.

135
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,955
I'm sick of
the cocky walk.

136
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:03,927
I am sick of you throwing
your paycheck in my face.

137
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:06,925
I am sick of your
uppity attitude, Jim.

138
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,300
I think I am not going
to give these to you.

139
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,668
- Yes!
- Yeah!

140
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:15,366
We need those leads, Michael.

141
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,170
That's our job,
Michael. Michael!

142
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,507
Michael, we spent
a lot of money on those leads.

143
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:24,640
You have to
give them out.

144
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:27,241
Then we are just rewarding
their bad behavior.

145
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,186
Okay, just imagine

146
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:33,452
that instead of going to
jail for murdering someone,

147
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:35,827
you got an ice cream cone.

148
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:38,590
If that were the case,
then in the summertime,

149
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:42,326
everyone would go
around killing people

150
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,632
for the pleasure
of an ice cream cone.

151
00:06:45,704 --> 00:06:48,764
Michael, I don't want
to incentivize murder,

152
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,569
but we've tried
to make it clear

153
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:52,974
that our policy
emphasizes sales staff.

154
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:55,308
They act like
I have no power.

155
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:57,311
But you do.
You are in charge...

156
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:59,077
Thank you... Of
supporting the sales staff.

157
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:00,914
You are required to hand
out those leads, Michael.

158
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:02,112
Mmm-hmm.

159
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:06,021
Well, if that is what I am required
to do, I will do exactly that.

160
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:07,786
Okay, good.
Exactly that.

161
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:09,622
Good.
Exactly that.

162
00:07:09,694 --> 00:07:11,093
Why do you
keep repeating...

163
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:16,425
Hello. May I have
everyone's attention, please?

164
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,760
Gabe has instructed me
to hand out the leads,

165
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:22,466
so I am going to give
the leads to King Creed.

166
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:23,732
What?
What are you...

167
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:26,744
And to King Meredith!

168
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:28,109
They aren't
sales people.

169
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,341
And to King Angela.

170
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:33,782
Because today we are
all kings and queens.

171
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:35,876
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

172
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:38,445
I am giving them
the leads, Phyllis.

173
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:45,124
Hey.
Hey.

174
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:47,492
So I'm gonna go ahead
and save you some time,

175
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:50,592
and tell you that no one's
gonna go along with this.

176
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:51,795
But you knew that, right?

177
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,894
Mmm-hmm.

178
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:56,930
All right. So, why don't you just
give me my share of the leads,

179
00:07:57,275 --> 00:07:59,300
and I'll start
making some calls?

180
00:07:59,377 --> 00:08:00,469
Okay.

181
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:05,973
Hey, all right.
All right.

182
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:10,951
These aren't leads.
What are they?

183
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:13,513
Oh, right.
Those are clues,

184
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:15,492
and within each clue
is a lesson.

185
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,051
You learn a lesson,
and then you find a lead.

186
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:21,621
The leads are scattered
all over the industrial park.

187
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,692
I'm trying to make
your kids respect you,

188
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:28,102
because a father needs
to respect his boss,

189
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:31,506
and kids don't respect the father
who doesn't respect the boss.

190
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:33,043
Do you understand
that line of logic?

191
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:34,339
I don't even think
you understand it.

192
00:08:34,412 --> 00:08:36,141
I do understand it.

193
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:38,449
This one's a map.

194
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:39,506
Or is it?

195
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:46,953
How the tables have turned!
I see you got my email.

196
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,760
Are you gonna give me the leads or not?

197
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:53,320
I'll give you the leads.
But you know what?

198
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:56,800
It's gonna cost you
some clerical work.

199
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:58,995
What are these for?
It doesn't matter.

200
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,628
Fill them out.
All of them.

201
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:03,071
And when you're done, you
can watch me shred them.

202
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:04,540
Right.

203
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:06,543
I want to watch
The Kardashians, okay?

204
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:08,272
I don't want to watch Bored
To Death. It's mindless!

205
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:09,574
Kardashians is a good show.
It is...

206
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:10,706
Thank you, Stanley!
No, you don't even know!

207
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:12,147
How would he even
know The Kardashians?

208
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:14,515
It's about a family, a real-life
family. No, Stanley, do you...

209
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:16,344
Hey, baby, what's up?

210
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:19,185
I am currently reading
incoherent riddles

211
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:22,124
on blue index cards
to find vital information

212
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:25,890
that Michael has hidden all
over the office. How are you?

213
00:09:26,264 --> 00:09:28,926
Nothing but vomit
and diapers over here.

214
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,059
Oh, my God.
I couldn't envy you more.

215
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:34,299
Having a baby is as
exhausting as they say it is.

216
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:37,507
Having two babies,
that's just unfair.

217
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:39,542
How about this one?

218
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:42,273
"When arrogant salesmen
are mean to my face,

219
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:45,214
"a certain manager will
go to his moppy place."

220
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:47,012
He means
his mopey place.

221
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:49,986
It's under that street lamp
that he thinks was in Casablanca.

222
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:51,113
God, I love you.

223
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:55,222
Today I turned an office
crisis into a teachable moment.

224
00:09:55,627 --> 00:10:00,223
A lesser manager would have
screwed this day up royally.

225
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:03,358
I can imagine some yokel
sitting behind his desk saying,

226
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:06,268
"Oh, yeah, take a lead. Learn nothing."

227
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:08,636
Some people shouldn't
be in this business.

228
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:13,636
Hey. I guess you probably
won't give me your leads

229
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:15,304
since I'm a jerk salesman.

230
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,940
Yeah. I basically
wish you were dead.

231
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:20,545
I hid the leads.

232
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:21,779
Where?

233
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:29,120
Colder.

234
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:33,329
Colder.

235
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,495
Warmer.

236
00:10:39,104 --> 00:10:40,298
Warmer.

237
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:44,607
Colder. Colder. Warmer.

238
00:10:45,877 --> 00:10:48,175
Warmer. Warmer!

239
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:51,177
Hot! Hotter.

240
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:54,310
Burning hot! Lower.

241
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:56,250
Are you...
Lower.

242
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:57,788
Are you sure?

243
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:00,281
Lower.

244
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:08,189
What are you doing, idiot?

245
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:10,325
Michael's stupid
scavenger hunt.

246
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:13,462
Scavenger hunt? Here.
I can solve it. Give it.

247
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:15,796
"The treasure you seek
is in the parking lot

248
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:17,933
"under the first president"?

249
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:19,237
Lincoln.

250
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:22,674
The prankster
is getting pranked.

251
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:25,612
It involves you, too.

252
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:27,240
The leads are in?

253
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:29,714
Michael?

254
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,816
Michael, you were supposed to
tell me when the leads came in.

255
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:36,952
Well, big shot, if you
want to find your leads,

256
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:39,394
go to the man
who never breeds.

257
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:41,688
Kevin.

258
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:42,994
Damn it!

259
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:46,003
Kevin! Give me those leads.
Where are they? Come on!

260
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:48,039
You are never
going to find them.

261
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:50,301
Really?
I'm going to enjoy this.

262
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,309
Give me the leads!
Where are my leads?

263
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:53,366
Give me the leads!

264
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:54,673
I'm still enjoying it!

265
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:55,974
Where are they?

266
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:58,481
They're in the trash.
They're in the trash.

267
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:01,581
The trash. It's code.

268
00:12:02,187 --> 00:12:04,314
All right, Meredith.
Take off your dress.

269
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:05,413
Okey-dokey.

270
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,684
No, dear God, no.

271
00:12:06,758 --> 00:12:09,192
It's in the trashcan.
In the kitchen.

272
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:11,795
It's coming off
either way.

273
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:22,771
Clean sack.

274
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:25,408
What...
I emptied it in the dumpster.

275
00:12:25,477 --> 00:12:27,604
It had Toby's baba ghanoush.

276
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:31,439
If we don't patronize the
only Syrian restaurant in town,

277
00:12:31,516 --> 00:12:35,077
there'll be nothing left
but pan pizzas

278
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:37,246
and, you know,
make-your-own-salads.

279
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:44,951
It's empty!

280
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,257
Wait. What day is today?

281
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:49,095
Tonight is Ghost Whisperer,
so Friday.

282
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:53,627
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! No, no, no!

283
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:56,201
Hey, hey!

284
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:59,270
Wait! Wait!

285
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:04,204
Okay, you know what? Let's just
go to the dump, start looking.

286
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:06,409
Ryan, come on.
Shotgun in my car.

287
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:08,315
Michael, why would
we all go to the dump?

288
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:10,877
Why? Because I am
not going to call Sabre

289
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:14,891
and say, "Hi! You know those
very valuable, expensive leads

290
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,586
"that you gave us
earlier today?

291
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:18,424
"Well, because of a screw-up
by a staff member,

292
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:19,827
"they're now
in the city dump."

293
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:22,093
Not your staff, Michael. You.

294
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:23,794
Well, that's not the way
it's gonna sound.

295
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:26,234
Here's what we'll do. We'll go
to the dump, we'll look around,

296
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:27,999
then we'll all go
out and get pizza,

297
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:30,267
maybe catch a movie,
late-night drink,

298
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:31,740
some more pizza, call it
a night. What do you...

299
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,677
Does it have to be pizza?
Could we go for a falafel?

300
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:35,735
Really?

301
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,907
I'm not going.
You did this, not us.

302
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:42,214
Okay, no. You encouraged it.
You were complicit. Complicit.

303
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:44,113
You were all successories.

304
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:46,157
That sounds fun, mucking
around in the dump.

305
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:47,623
I wish I could go.
You can.

306
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:49,683
I can't.
You know that.

307
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:52,127
Okay, fine, I get it.
I'll just go by myself.

308
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:53,895
I'll go, Michael.

309
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:57,262
'Cause you'll just
screw it up.

310
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,710
This place has gone to hell.

311
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:19,882
You know, Dwight, there was a
time you'd be pinching yourself

312
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,859
to have the opportunity to
look through a dump with me.

313
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:24,952
Yeah, well,
the acorn becomes the oak.

314
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:28,760
Yeah. Well, sometimes the
acorn just stays an acorn.

315
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,460
If you don't believe me,
look in my gutters.

316
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:33,365
You're adorable.
You need to go for it.

317
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:36,635
I'm gonna be, like, mad at you
if you don't... Yeah, whatever.

318
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:41,844
Can't wait
for this day to be over.

319
00:14:41,913 --> 00:14:43,847
Why?
Just all the drama.

320
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:45,280
What drama?

321
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,840
Between the...

322
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:49,177
Us and you guys.

323
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:51,579
It's unnecessary, right?

324
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:52,680
So unnecessary.

325
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:54,987
Good. Thank God you said that.

326
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,757
You know,
maybe if the salesmen

327
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:58,659
weren't acting like such
a bunch of stuck-up losers,

328
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,131
then this day wouldn't be so
bad. Did you ever think of that?

329
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:05,993
I have new
baby pictures.

330
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,162
Jim.

331
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:11,241
Don't use your cute
baby to make us like you.

332
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:12,776
She's wearing a Onesie.

333
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:14,839
Stop it.

334
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:19,014
If we act nice now,

335
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,483
then we're rewarding them
for treating us poorly.

336
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:22,610
Didn't we kind of start it?

337
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:24,484
Mmm. I think you're
remembering that wrong.

338
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:25,715
Yeah. PHYLLIS: I
don't know about this.

339
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,519
I mean, I think we
should hold our ground.

340
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:30,186
The company's changed, and if
they don't like it, they can leave.

341
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:33,526
I mean, a lot of their
work can be done from India.

342
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,997
Can we at least all agree
that this is uncomfortable,

343
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:38,592
and maybe heading
for something bad?

344
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:40,502
All those who agree
say "aye."

345
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:41,629
Aye.

346
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:43,571
All those opposed? I don't
think we need opposed.

347
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:46,372
You've changed, man.

348
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:49,609
Oh, why, 'cause I have a
shot at a 100K commission?

349
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:52,149
Since when do you
care about money?

350
00:15:52,216 --> 00:15:54,241
When I first met you,
you were a wide-eyed innocent.

351
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:56,549
Hey, there is nothing I can
do about my wide-set eyes.

352
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:58,885
No, no, no, I'm talking about
your personality, Dwight!

353
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:02,393
Okay, when I first met you,
I had a lot of job offers.

354
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:05,926
And I had an offer
from lvan Schotsky.

355
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:08,727
The lvan Schotsky. If I
had assistant managed him...

356
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,824
Assistant to
the managed him.

357
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:11,630
Oh, that's low!

358
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:14,194
I would be number two
right now at a Home Depot!

359
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:15,261
Yeah.
Okay?

360
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,967
'Cause they promote
from within!

361
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,441
Instead I had to follow you.
You're going nowhere.

362
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,206
You think you would have done
better without me. Really?

363
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,942
I hitched my wagon
to a horse with no legs.

364
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:29,146
Wow! Okay! Man!

365
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:32,781
When I think
about all the time

366
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:35,348
that I wasted
being your friend!

367
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:36,688
I shouldn't have
been hanging out

368
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:38,194
watching karate
movies with you!

369
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:39,524
Kung fu movies!

370
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:40,723
You know what I should have been doing?

371
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:43,494
I should have been out at
bars finding my soul mate,

372
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:45,229
finding my wife,
making babies.

373
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:48,295
Nice babies you're making
with the floozies at the bars!

374
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:50,238
That's my wife you're
talking about, man!

375
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:53,209
Your made-up wife
who doesn't exist?

376
00:16:54,912 --> 00:16:55,970
You watch it!

377
00:16:56,047 --> 00:17:00,541
If I'd wanted to hit you, I would
have hit you. Don't do it! No, no.

378
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:04,114
You just made an enemy
with the wrong guy, Dwight.

379
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:11,826
Wait. Timeout,
timeout, timeout!

380
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,500
Time-in.
No!

381
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:20,763
Don't... Don't even
think about that.

382
00:17:26,277 --> 00:17:27,505
Stop it!

383
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:30,172
Give me that.
That's my spool!

384
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:33,782
What's the least we can do
to make this okay?

385
00:17:33,851 --> 00:17:35,648
I'll text Pam. She's
really good at this stuff.

386
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,780
Yeah. I'll text Erin. She's
really good at this stuff, too.

387
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,682
I mean, I guess we could give
them some of our new commissions.

388
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,819
That is
a dangerous precedent.

389
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:47,194
Pam texted back saying we
could give them all iPods.

390
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:50,393
If they don't have an iPod by
now, they really don't want one.

391
00:17:50,468 --> 00:17:52,993
All right. Then we're back to cash.

392
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:54,629
And I gotta say,

393
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:56,605
if giving a small
percentage of our commissions

394
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:58,665
is gonna smooth all
this over, I'm for it.

395
00:17:58,743 --> 00:18:00,643
Okay, fine,
cash it is.

396
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:02,269
Erin just texted me back.

397
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:04,837
"People love shells
from faraway beaches."

398
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:09,615
Okay, Dwight.
All right, Dwight.

399
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:12,884
Here we go! Here we go! Oh, God!

400
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:13,946
Oh.

401
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,503
We're never gonna find
those leads, are we?

402
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:32,634
No.

403
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:46,049
Amazing, isn't it?

404
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:49,656
No other animal on Earth
could do this.

405
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,753
Maybe beavers.
But not like this.

406
00:18:56,667 --> 00:19:00,330
So, how about, guys, 1%
commission a month instead of 2%?

407
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:01,530
What do you think...
No.

408
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:03,506
No, we agreed 2% for the quarter. Yes.

409
00:19:03,574 --> 00:19:05,940
Okay. Hey, everybody.

410
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,534
Nice spread. We get it.

411
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:09,671
You eat like royalty.
No, no.

412
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:12,147
This is a representation
of how we feel,

413
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:14,480
and how we feel
is really sorry.

414
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:17,214
Yeah. We wanted to bring you
in and make a peace offering.

415
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:20,553
Yeah, we wanted to
do the right thing, so...

416
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:23,222
Way to go, guys.
This...

417
00:19:24,262 --> 00:19:25,661
This was an
integrity move.

418
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,925
Yeah. When we
walked in here,

419
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,999
we were all prepared
to tell you to go to hell.

420
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:32,660
Do you have any pastries without fruit?

421
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:35,433
Yes, we do. Eclairs.

422
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:40,007
Well, you better be
happy, taking 2% of our...

423
00:19:40,077 --> 00:19:42,545
2% milk! What I forgot for the coffee.

424
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:43,637
Yeah, treats, Stanley.

425
00:19:43,714 --> 00:19:45,705
They've accepted our
simple offer of treats only,

426
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:47,011
nothing more.

427
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,322
This is nice.
All of us back together.

428
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:55,520
This?

429
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,154
Why would somebody
throw that out?

430
00:19:57,228 --> 00:19:59,162
Waste.

431
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,458
Hey.

432
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:06,802
You know who'd
like this? Phyllis.

433
00:20:07,104 --> 00:20:08,093
Purple much?

434
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:09,298
Yeah, she does.

435
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,771
She loves purple.
Does it stink?

436
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:14,569
Yeah.

437
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:18,171
You know what would be
a great picture here?

438
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:21,616
Just this whole dump, and
in the middle, one flower.

439
00:20:21,686 --> 00:20:23,051
Mmm-hmm.
That's it.

440
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:24,712
Wow.

441
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:27,888
And the caption
would read...

442
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:30,860
"Hope grows."

443
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:33,553
"In a dump."

444
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:41,732
Is the good news
that you found our leads?

445
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:42,966
No. Better.

446
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,405
We have an awesome beanbag chair

447
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:45,737
that's perfect
for the break room.

448
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,370
I'm never
gonna sit on that disgusting seat.

449
00:20:48,446 --> 00:20:50,971
Yeah, damn right you're not,
'cause it's for me and Michael only!

450
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:55,007
Yeah!
Yeah!

451
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:00,215
It's freezing out here.

452
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,383
Yeah!

453
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:06,089
I have warm blood.

454
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:09,230
Oh, wow. Thank you.

455
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:16,266
You're the nicest person
I've ever met.
