1
00:00:02,301 --> 00:00:07,466
The fundamentals of business.
The fundamentals of business.

2
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:11,100
"Mental" is a part of the
word. I have underlined it.

3
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:14,009
Because you're mental if
you don't have a good time.

4
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:15,444
You have to enjoy it.

5
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:17,607
"Fun" is in it.

6
00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:20,207
"Fun" -damental.

7
00:00:20,285 --> 00:00:21,650
Oh, right.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,620
Get out.
I know, I know.

9
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:26,954
Yes, so, it all starts
with a handshake.

10
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:31,929
But you can't just go right to
the selling. You need small talk.

11
00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:34,727
What topics can you
use for small talk?

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,428
Golf, stock market,
Dave Matthews.

13
00:00:37,503 --> 00:00:38,936
Yes, what else?

14
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:41,404
Small things. Peas,
ball bearings, dimes.

15
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:42,497
No.

16
00:00:42,574 --> 00:00:44,371
The weekend.
Yeah! That's good.

17
00:00:44,443 --> 00:00:48,243
Come on up. Meredith, come up
here. Let's do a little something.

18
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:51,749
So, Meredith and I have
just started conversing,

19
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:54,149
and I will say,
"So, Meredith,

20
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:56,084
"how was your weekend?
What did you do?"

21
00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:00,115
Well, I caught my son taking a dump
on the upper part of the toilet.

22
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:01,716
All right. He calls
it an "upper-decker."

23
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:03,989
Okay, okay.
God.

24
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:07,362
What you people don't know about
business, I could fill a book with.

25
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:08,991
Then do it.
What?

26
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:10,535
Write a book.

27
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:15,730
The Fundamentals of Business
by Michael Scott.

28
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:18,006
Over one billion sold.

29
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:22,443
More than the Bible. I'm
not surprised. Chapter One.

30
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:27,912
The businessman...

31
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,601
Mr. Grotti,
this is Michael Scott.

32
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:54,907
He's the person
you should talk to.

33
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,005
Hi. I'm sorry,
just a sec.

34
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,811
Erin, you're
supposed to be the gatekeeper.

35
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:02,547
Do you have any idea
how valuable my time is?

36
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:05,419
In your schedule, it just says
9:00 till noon is creative space.

37
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:06,480
I thought this
could be part of that.

38
00:02:06,558 --> 00:02:09,049
Do you know how creative space works?

39
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,993
Okay, fine. Just cancel my afternoon.

40
00:02:11,063 --> 00:02:13,327
You don't have anything in the
afternoon. It just says "free play."

41
00:02:13,398 --> 00:02:15,229
Push free play till tomorrow morning.

42
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,737
Hi. Sorry, crazy day. You're
seeing how the sausage gets made.

43
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:23,969
Come in the conference room and I
will show you a finished sausage.

44
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:29,203
As a manager of business,
you've got a lot of pride.

45
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:30,305
Hmm.

46
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:32,976
But you also got a
lot of responsibility.

47
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:34,075
Yep.

48
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:36,883
None greater, perhaps,
than the need to be sure

49
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:42,359
that your small or large business is
secure in the event of a covered loss.

50
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:43,587
Okay.

51
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:49,156
There's nothing more
insulting to a great salesman

52
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:51,964
than having to listen
to a bad salesman.

53
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:55,069
It's like a great
basketball player

54
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,075
having to listen to a
bad basketball player.

55
00:03:03,582 --> 00:03:05,174
Jim's gone
on his honeymoon.

56
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:09,214
So, I started borrowing
his office to fart in.

57
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:12,815
Then one day, I came
in and I just stayed.

58
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:16,725
'Cause this place is awesome.
It feels like home now.

59
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:20,458
Even better than my home.
My home sucks.

60
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:23,266
What do you think?

61
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:24,393
I think you're right.

62
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:26,528
Definitely looks
suspicious.

63
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:29,904
And his southern Italian
heritage raises some flags.

64
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:34,501
God forbid you should have
a fire in the warehouse.

65
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,676
Oh! Yep. Yeah. Definitely.
All that paper burning up.

66
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,379
Yeah, and the truck goes off the
side of the road, there's injury.

67
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:44,649
Mmm-hmm, I hear you. The truck.

68
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:46,486
You will be hearing
from me, Mr. Scott.

69
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:47,582
Okay, well...

70
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:49,752
I can be very,
very persistent.

71
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:50,817
Do your worst.

72
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,691
All right.

73
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,204
Would you look
at that, people?

74
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:03,036
What an unpredictable
world we live in, huh?

75
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,975
Thank you.

76
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:09,012
What happened in there? Nothing,

77
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:12,141
other than once again, I am just
thankful that I am a paper salesman.

78
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:13,241
Did he threaten you?

79
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:15,343
No, Dwight. Not everything is a threat.

80
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,409
Mobsters are.

81
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:18,786
There is no such
thing as monsters.

82
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:20,825
- He drives an SUV.
- I knew it.

83
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:23,258
More trunk space, or
should I say corpse space.

84
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:26,092
Okay, guys, I drive an SUV.
Does that mean I'm in the mob?

85
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:29,656
No, not that by itself,
but look at all the facts.

86
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:31,896
He seems like a mobster.

87
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,029
Wait, when did we start
talking about the mob?

88
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:35,573
The guy was trying
to sell me insurance.

89
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:37,199
All mobsters
have a front.

90
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:38,971
Sometimes it's
selling insurance,

91
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:41,945
sometimes it's waste
management or sanitation.

92
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:44,642
For the record, not all
Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.

93
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:47,583
I think he just seemed like he
was trying to sell me insurance.

94
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:50,417
Yeah. "Buy my insurance or
I burn your warehouse down."

95
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:51,513
Exactly.

96
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,081
He did talk about
a fire in the warehouse.

97
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,285
And he also vaguely threatened
me with testicular cancer.

98
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,195
All right.
Who else is here?

99
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:02,130
Pam and Jim are
on their honeymoon,

100
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,795
so there's not the usual
balance between sane and others.

101
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:08,772
Toby has mentally
checked out since June.

102
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,368
It's a very dangerous time. The
coalition for reason is extremely weak.

103
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,140
Oscar says
I checked out, huh?

104
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:18,605
Huh!

105
00:05:19,117 --> 00:05:20,414
This is bad. All right.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

106
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:22,350
Calm down,
calm down, calm down.

107
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:23,979
Ryan, you lived in New
York, what do you think?

108
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:26,820
Well, first of all, there's
no such thing as the Mafia.

109
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:29,884
Okay. What you have
are specific families.

110
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:31,428
What's the guy's
last name?

111
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:33,589
Um, it is Grotti.

112
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:35,292
Oh, no.
That is...

113
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:36,459
What? What?

114
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:38,503
John Gotti, you idiot.

115
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,765
It's a completely
different name.

116
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,363
So he won't get caught. DWIGHT: Yeah.

117
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:43,499
It's pretty close.

118
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:44,564
What are you
talking about?

119
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:47,840
What mobster would change his name
from Gotti to Grotti? It weakens it.

120
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:51,542
No, I disagree. "R" is among
the most menacing of sounds.

121
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:53,777
That's why they call it
"murder," not "mukduk."

122
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:58,118
Okay, too many different words coming
at me from too many different sentences.

123
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,179
Lock your door.

124
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:01,316
I'm not going
to lock my door.

125
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:06,429
Hello?
Jim, it's Oscar.

126
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:08,591
I'm so sorry to be calling
you on your honeymoon.

127
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:10,794
Oscar,
what is going on?

128
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:15,330
It's Michael. He thinks he's
being shaken down by the mob.

129
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:17,204
I don't know how you
usually handle this.

130
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:19,004
We're in
Puerto Rico, so...

131
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:21,204
Hey, Oscar. It's Pam, hey. Hey.

132
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,303
We're on our
honeymoon.

133
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,370
Pam, I'm sorry.

134
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:24,745
Unless someone
very close to us

135
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:26,078
is in immediate
physical danger,

136
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:27,482
you should not
be calling us.

137
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:28,849
You're right,
you're right.

138
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,320
All right. Okay, bye.

139
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:36,518
It's from Grotti.
He's following up.

140
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:37,653
Already?

141
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:40,095
This guy's persistent.

142
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:43,498
Okay. "I feel that
you will regret

143
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:46,230
"missing this great
opportunity to be in business."

144
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:49,204
That's bad. That's bad. Yeah. Yeah.

145
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:52,072
What are my options here?
Do I just ignore it or...

146
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:54,635
Yeah, right.
You heard him,

147
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:56,112
he's going to burn
the warehouse down

148
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:57,546
or run one of our
trucks off the road.

149
00:06:57,616 --> 00:06:59,083
Okay, I'm calling
the police.

150
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,719
That is the stupidest thing
you could do right now.

151
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:05,450
No, he's right.
Cops can't do anything

152
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:06,718
until a crime
has been reported.

153
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:07,781
All right.
Not only that,

154
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:09,451
but if they find out you snitched,

155
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:12,588
you get a dead horse's
chopped off head in your bed.

156
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:14,097
You know what?
That's not going to happen.

157
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,531
That's an exaggeration.
- That's how it works.

158
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,828
What am I
supposed to do here?

159
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:20,201
When somebody threatens you,
you give in right away.

160
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:22,832
Okay, you need to buy insurance from
this guy and get him off your back.

161
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:24,000
I was thinking exactly the same thing.

162
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:26,339
No. Criminals are like
raccoons, okay?

163
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:27,435
You give them
a taste of cat food,

164
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:29,309
pretty soon they'll be
back for the whole cat.

165
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:31,110
Dwight. The only way to defeat a bully

166
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:34,346
is to stand up to him. Trust me,
I have bullied a lot of people.

167
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:35,647
I don't know. I don't know about that.

168
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,745
Wait. Let's hear him out.
This is interesting.

169
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:40,690
Here's what we do. We
meet him in a public place,

170
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,522
ask him to lunch
or something like that.

171
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:44,562
Someplace where he
can't be openly violent.

172
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:45,789
Okay.
Let him know

173
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:48,355
that you are not the typical kind
of guy that he can shake down,

174
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:52,096
that you're stubborn, that you
might even be a little bit dangerous.

175
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,434
I like this plan. I'd like to
officially withdraw my plan.

176
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:55,871
Hold on, hold on,
just...

177
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:57,238
No, no, no, no.
My plan is out.

178
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,742
We do it the hard way.

179
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,211
All right, I will meet with
him, but I'm not going alone.

180
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,408
Well, you're going to
have to. We'll be right beside you.

181
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:06,508
What?

182
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:12,053
All right.

183
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:23,096
What are you wearing?
Who's Pat?

184
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:26,626
If I'm going to back you up, I need
a weapon without drawing suspicion.

185
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:28,172
And I have to
justify it somehow,

186
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,504
so I'm a mechanic
with a tire thing.

187
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:31,735
Do you know
how to use it?

188
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,334
To change tires, no.

189
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:35,811
But, I mean, it's metal,
I can hit somebody with it.

190
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,576
Let's go, come on.

191
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:40,409
God. God.

192
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,287
Should I change?
You're wearing loafers.

193
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,346
Forget it.
Forget it.

194
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,788
Take that thing off
the table. Please.

195
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:55,631
Well, then I can't use it.
I'm just going to hide it.

196
00:08:57,502 --> 00:09:00,494
Hey. The bathroom
checks out clean.

197
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:02,472
Nothing behind the toilet
except this roach motel.

198
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,406
No! God!
Oh, my God.

199
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:06,103
You'll never kill it that way. Guys.

200
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:07,508
You want to separate
the head from the thorax.

201
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:10,241
Guys, guys. Cool it.

202
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:12,973
There he is, there he is.

203
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:16,411
Hello.
Mr. Scott, hello.

204
00:09:16,488 --> 00:09:20,481
Mr. Grotti, we meet again.
These are my associates.

205
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,821
Hi, Angelo Grotti.

206
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:22,951
Hi.
Hello.

207
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:25,053
So...
You got this table?

208
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,927
Yes. What's this, one
of them half-booths,

209
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:28,295
can't-decide-what-it-is
type of thing?

210
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:29,526
Well...

211
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:32,593
Waitress, we're going
to sit over here.

212
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,899
That's fine.

213
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:35,064
Okay.

214
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:44,437
Hello?

215
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:45,574
Hello, Mr. Halpert.

216
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,676
I'm calling from the Identity
Theft department at Capital One.

217
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:51,745
We've detected some unusual
activity on your credit card.

218
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:54,383
Oh, man. Do you think
it was stolen?

219
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:57,553
First, would you mind
verifying your home address?

220
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:58,755
Um... Yes.

221
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,392
383 Linden Ave.,
Scranton, PA.

222
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,961
And may I have the last four
digits of your social security?

223
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,666
Six-six-five-zero.

224
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:13,734
Well, Mr. Halpert, you're obviously
not in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

225
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:15,143
Wait a minute.
Yes, I am.

226
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:17,010
I'm going to go ahead
and put a hold on your card.

227
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:19,346
No. That... I...

228
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:24,251
I think that we should let the
criminal use the card a little longer.

229
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:27,582
Very funny, sir. We'll get a
new card out to you right away.

230
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:30,184
No. Have a nice day and thank you.

231
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:35,021
Shoot.

232
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,297
If you want to supplement
your coverage, we can do that.

233
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,931
If you want to replace your
current coverage, all the better.

234
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:43,201
Hey, you seem
like a nice guy.

235
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:44,468
Oh, he's not that nice.

236
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:46,009
That's true.
Mmm-hmm.

237
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:48,205
That's very true.
Okay, shut up.

238
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,076
Have you decided?

239
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:53,242
Yeah, I'll have the linguini,
red sauce on the side.

240
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:56,845
If the sauce does not come on
the side, I will send it back.

241
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:59,355
I want garlic bread,
toasted, not burnt.

242
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:01,790
If it comes burnt,
I will send it back.

243
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,795
Okay, then.
And for you, sir?

244
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:06,228
I will have
the gabbagool.

245
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:08,160
The what?

246
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:11,033
The gabbagool.

247
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,499
I don't really know
what that is.

248
00:11:13,571 --> 00:11:15,266
You know,
gabbagool.

249
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,705
I don't have to have that.

250
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:18,572
What he's trying to
say is, gabbagool.

251
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:19,632
Guys, guys,
all right.

252
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:20,803
I don't really think
that we have that.

253
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,540
That's okay. Bring him the gabbagool.

254
00:11:22,614 --> 00:11:25,981
I will have the
spaghetti with a side salad.

255
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:27,143
Okay.

256
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:30,014
If the salad is on top,
I send it back.

257
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:33,088
Why would you cancel
Jim's credit cards?

258
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:35,149
I usually can think
quick on my feet,

259
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:37,126
but they were so
fast on the phone.

260
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:39,095
This constitutes
identity fraud.

261
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:40,392
Oh, God.

262
00:11:40,632 --> 00:11:43,829
I wouldn't last in jail,
Oscar. I'm not like you.

263
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:46,800
What's that
supposed to mean?

264
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:48,771
What, you don't
know about jail?

265
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,967
You would love jail.

266
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:52,709
Why would I love jail?

267
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:56,213
Because...
You would love it.

268
00:11:58,116 --> 00:12:03,213
I don't think our company actually
needs any more insurance. So, I am out.

269
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:06,917
Look closely, Michael. I feel
there's a plan here for you.

270
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,820
Maybe we have
a plan for you.

271
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:11,725
How about you?

272
00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:14,788
Maybe you can use supplemental
coverage of some kind.

273
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:16,493
Anybody can get hurt.

274
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,968
You always think it can't
happen to you, and...

275
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:22,403
Think about it.

276
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:24,704
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you.

277
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:25,936
Are you a mechanic?

278
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,068
Yeah.

279
00:12:27,145 --> 00:12:29,511
My battery's dead. I've got
my kid. Can you please help?

280
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:30,570
Yes, I can.

281
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:31,842
No, no, no,
no, come on.

282
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,349
I'm sorry, we're
having our salads.

283
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:35,750
Come on,
lady in distress.

284
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,809
Go, go.

285
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:38,685
Okay. Sorry.

286
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:42,022
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

287
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:43,253
Hey, do you
need any help?

288
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:46,092
I'm sure he can handle
a simple jumpstart.

289
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:47,654
Now, come on, sit down.

290
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:48,721
He's a good mechanic.

291
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,028
Sit down.

292
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:52,262
Where were we?
I don't...

293
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:54,635
He was trying to force you to
sign a policy. Okay, okay, okay.

294
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:56,697
So, we're choosing...
Okay. Yep.

295
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,744
Did you check out Dental?
All right, put it down.

296
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:05,306
Black goes on the red with
the... If we... Positive...

297
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:10,179
It being a motor drive,
it's probably down.

298
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:12,086
He seems bad at this.

299
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:15,126
You want to do this, junior?
I didn't think so.

300
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:20,255
I'm sorry, just had kind of a
long day at the mechanic store.

301
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:27,994
You've got
a leaky spark tube.

302
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:29,061
What?

303
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,801
So, your car's totaled.

304
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,173
You're gonna want to
get a refund on that.

305
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:36,611
Or my guy could do it, he's
great. But I can't do that for you.

306
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:39,377
I work exclusively
on motorcycles.

307
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:42,550
All right.

308
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:47,253
Now, if you could just sign
this letter of intent,

309
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:49,452
I'll bring this
back to my boss

310
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:50,892
and we can get
this in motion.

311
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,889
You okay, Pat?

312
00:13:56,968 --> 00:13:57,957
Yeah, I was
just thinking

313
00:13:58,069 --> 00:14:03,530
about how I had this car.
It was this Italian car.

314
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:05,439
And I was driving it,

315
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,444
and it kept
telling me how much

316
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:09,980
it needed oil, but I
wouldn't give it any oil.

317
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:12,949
And then, one day it exploded
and it killed everyone,

318
00:14:13,017 --> 00:14:14,644
and that's what
I'm afraid of.

319
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:17,244
Aren't you a mechanic? Why
wouldn't you put oil in a car?

320
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:19,847
It was before my
technical training.

321
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:22,154
Don't do it.

322
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:24,118
Do it.

323
00:14:24,195 --> 00:14:25,753
Don't.
Just do it.

324
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,923
Okay.
Don't do it.

325
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:31,662
Look, Mike, I don't know what
your friends are telling you,

326
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:34,637
but you have to
decide for yourself.

327
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,697
I mean, are these guys
going to take care

328
00:14:36,774 --> 00:14:38,298
of your things
if you die tomorrow?

329
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:39,434
Yes.

330
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:42,768
Okay.

331
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:45,644
I don't understand. Why
would you buy a policy?

332
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:48,743
It's just the cost of
a cup of coffee an hour.

333
00:14:48,953 --> 00:14:51,478
You were man enough to back
down, Michael. I'm proud of you.

334
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:53,421
I had to make
a snap decision, Dwight.

335
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:55,789
It wasn't a snap decision. You
were sitting there for an hour.

336
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,055
It was a lot of
snap decisions.

337
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:59,858
- Do you know what "snap decision" means?
- Yes.

338
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:00,920
It means like this.

339
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:02,762
Just
get in the car.

340
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:06,393
Hello?
Jim?

341
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:08,439
Michael?
Oh, thank God.

342
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:10,440
How did you get this number?

343
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:11,532
Michael, we're on
a catamaran.

344
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:12,598
It wasn't easy.

345
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:15,339
I had to tell the hotel that
it was a medical emergency.

346
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:16,812
I chose a massive
coronary because

347
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:19,042
you told me that your
dad had a bad heart.

348
00:15:19,117 --> 00:15:22,746
Listen, man,
I got a problem.

349
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,847
I think I'm in trouble with the
mob or a major insurance carrier.

350
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,790
That sounds bad.
Yeah, I know.

351
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,294
And you usually can get
out of stuff like this,

352
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:32,852
so I'm turning to you,
my friend.

353
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:33,955
I'm going to help you
through it, all right?

354
00:15:34,032 --> 00:15:35,021
Okay.

355
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:36,999
All you're going
to need...

356
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:39,997
And then go to...

357
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:41,265
Jim. Are you...

358
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:42,863
And you'll be saved.

359
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:45,205
What? Wait. I didn't hear
a thing you just said.

360
00:15:45,276 --> 00:15:47,244
Just... And then
you'll be saved.

361
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:50,008
No! God, I missed
the important part again.

362
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:52,580
No. Oh, my God.

363
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,174
And you'll be saved.
No, Jim.

364
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:57,187
Please repeat what you're
saying, I can't understand you.

365
00:15:58,156 --> 00:16:01,887
Bermuda Triangle...
Please don't call again.

366
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:05,086
Jim?

367
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:08,029
Oh, my God.

368
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:19,343
Hey, question for you.

369
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:25,776
I recently purchased some insurance that
I can't afford given my present salary.

370
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:28,143
Is there anything
accounting-wise I can do

371
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:30,710
to sort of make
it all go away?

372
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:34,280
Accounting-wise, no, but phone-wise,
just call up and cancel it.

373
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:35,621
No, no.

374
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,352
Um...

375
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:40,559
What about this Cash
for Clunkers thing?

376
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:44,257
Just, no. No.

377
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:47,736
Okay. All right, well,
it was a thought. Thanks.

378
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,440
We have let Michael down,
and it's 85% your fault.

379
00:16:58,516 --> 00:17:00,381
He's alive,
so you're welcome.

380
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:02,681
Not on the inside,
he's not.

381
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:08,488
Look at his life. Broke, living
in fear, no friends, dead-end job.

382
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,823
Yeah, some of that
existed before.

383
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:12,692
Not the living in fear,
that's new.

384
00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:13,753
You're right,
that is new.

385
00:17:13,831 --> 00:17:15,458
Yes.

386
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:17,433
He's got to stand up
to this Mafia guy.

387
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:19,060
Well, I don't see
that happening.

388
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:20,263
Me neither.

389
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:22,363
Not the way
things are now.

390
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,638
But what if Michael felt no
fear toward the Mafia guy?

391
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:27,700
Are you saying...
Yeah.

392
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:31,078
...that we surgically remove the
fear center from Michael's brain?

393
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:32,241
What is wrong
with you?

394
00:17:32,316 --> 00:17:35,285
I am talking about convincing
Michael that the guy's not Mafia.

395
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:36,911
That seems
a little farfetched.

396
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:39,889
What, more farfetched than a
mobster walking into a paper company

397
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:42,892
for a low-level shakedown?
And that happened.

398
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:48,728
Michael, incredible
news. Grotti is clean.

399
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,226
No, he's not.
He's just good.

400
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:55,696
Nothing sticks to him. You still
don't understand how this works.

401
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:57,866
No, Michael, what
we're trying to say is,

402
00:17:57,942 --> 00:18:00,502
we made a mistake
assuming he was Mafia.

403
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:04,639
I have a buddy who's a Fed and we
did a background check on the guy,

404
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:06,376
his background
is perfectly clean.

405
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:07,543
It's true,
he's clean.

406
00:18:07,618 --> 00:18:10,382
I have a couple of friends still
on the force, checked with them,

407
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:13,117
ran his Fed friend up the flagpole
to make sure he wasn't on the take.

408
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:14,556
Turns out he's a totally lovely guy.

409
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,922
Sweetest guy on the force, really.

410
00:18:15,993 --> 00:18:17,585
Class act.
Boy scout.

411
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:19,562
But Grotti acts like
he's Mafia, though.

412
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,495
He's trying to intimidate
you to close sales.

413
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:23,056
He's just
a pushy salesman.

414
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:25,796
And he made us all
look like chumps.

415
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:32,241
If there is one thing I hate
more than the Mafia, it is a liar.

416
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,702
I wish the Mafia would go
out and kill all the liars.

417
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,080
And bury them in my yard. And I
wouldn't tell the cops a thing.

418
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:42,746
Not that I would
be lying, per se,

419
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,516
but I would just get really
quiet all of a sudden.

420
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,558
This is
Grotti. This is Scott.

421
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:51,288
Oh! Great, Michael. I'm just
finishing up your paperwork right now.

422
00:18:51,362 --> 00:18:53,956
Oh, really? Is that
supposed to scare me?

423
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:55,794
I thought
you'd be pleased.

424
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:57,994
Well, you thought wrong.

425
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:00,502
Because I am not pleased.
I'm actually kind of p.o.'d.

426
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:02,334
Why? I think you know exactly why.

427
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:06,467
Because you were trying to
scare me into buying insurance.

428
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:08,273
I don't get it.
How was I scaring you?

429
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:10,541
I think you knew exactly
what you were doing,

430
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:13,448
and frankly, I think you were
being a total and utter jerk.

431
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:14,542
Ooh, okay.

432
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:16,052
You suck.
- Okay. That's...

433
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,883
And I'm not going to buy
your stupid insurance.

434
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:19,650
That's good, let's wrap it
up. Okay. How about that?

435
00:19:19,724 --> 00:19:21,885
The only person that actually
needs insurance is you,

436
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,950
if you show your face
around here again. Got it?

437
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:26,622
Look, Michael, when
we all calm down here,

438
00:19:26,697 --> 00:19:28,289
maybe at some point
in the future,

439
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:30,527
you change your mind, why
don't you give me a call?

440
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:31,863
Doubt it.

441
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:35,864
Oh, man.

442
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,601
What a tool.

443
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:42,968
What?

444
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:44,173
Next time you look
in the mirror,

445
00:19:44,248 --> 00:19:48,685
you're going to be looking at
a guy who stood down the Mafia.

446
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,615
No. What do you mean?

447
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:55,420
We just told you he wasn't
Mafia so you wouldn't be scared.

448
00:19:56,627 --> 00:19:57,616
What?

449
00:19:57,695 --> 00:20:00,186
You successfully
backed down the mob.

450
00:20:00,264 --> 00:20:04,928
You made the Mafia apologize to
you. You made the Mafia be polite.

451
00:20:05,536 --> 00:20:07,265
Oh, man.

452
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:12,235
I should be mad
at you guys.

453
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:14,868
But I'm not.

454
00:20:14,946 --> 00:20:17,574
So, I looked him
in the eye and I said,

455
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:20,116
"Not today, Grotti.
Not today.

456
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:24,280
"And not tomorrow, and not the
next day, or the day after that.

457
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:26,346
"And you can tell
all your friends that

458
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:29,587
"if I see them,
then they are already dead."

459
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,922
I said something like that.

460
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:32,019
Very close.

461
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:33,085
Just to be clear,
he backed down

462
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:35,189
an insurance agent from
Mutual of Harrisburg.

463
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:36,255
Erin?
- Yes?

464
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:37,528
Coffee.
Okay.

465
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:39,900
Not from the kitchen,
Stop & Shop.

466
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:41,461
If it's not Stop & Shop,
I send it back.

467
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:42,528
Okay.

468
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:44,632
Large. If it's a medium, I send it back.

469
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,939
If it's an extra large,
I send it back.

470
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:48,376
How do you
return coffee?

471
00:20:48,446 --> 00:20:49,470
Go.

472
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:52,739
Any questions?

473
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:56,414
Are you kidding me?

474
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:58,648
Hi, Pam. Is Jim there?

475
00:20:58,723 --> 00:21:01,283
Listen, our credit card has been
canceled and we have to deal with that.

476
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,385
And I really can't handle the
fact that you're calling us here.

477
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:07,829
Okay, that sounds good.
I'll let you go.

478
00:21:07,898 --> 00:21:12,426
Just tell Jim
that I said hi.

479
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:16,837
I will. I will, Kevin. I will
make that my top priority.

480
00:21:16,907 --> 00:21:18,602
Cool. Okay. Bye.

481
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:24,378
They have no idea
what happened.
