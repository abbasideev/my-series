1
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,561
Could you please sign
my expense report?

2
00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:08,663
No way, no how. Expense
reports are a day-to-day item.

3
00:00:08,741 --> 00:00:12,734
That is Jim's now. I am
exclusively big picture. Epic.

4
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:22,816
Sign this.
Uh-uh-uh.

5
00:00:22,888 --> 00:00:24,822
Where's the please?
We're not animals.

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,414
Sign it.

7
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:27,823
No. Not without a please.

8
00:00:29,294 --> 00:00:30,488
Idiot.

9
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:35,795
I have a complaint
about Jim.

10
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:37,893
That is not
big picture.

11
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:43,340
I would like to file a huge,
enormous, massive complaint

12
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:46,207
about the tallest guy
in our office.

13
00:00:51,683 --> 00:00:52,809
Okay.

14
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:55,348
Jim won't sign
my expense report.

15
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:57,548
That is not...
Okay. Day-to-day.

16
00:00:57,623 --> 00:00:59,284
That is day-to-day.
No. That is huge.

17
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:02,919
You're trying to trick me. Get out,
get out, get out, get out, get out.

18
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:07,922
I'd like to lodge
a complaint.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,230
I'm sorry to hear about that.
Who is this about?

20
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:11,428
You.
Okay.

21
00:01:11,503 --> 00:01:14,097
Just want to let you know I
take complaints very seriously,

22
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:16,607
so, when did
this happen?

23
00:01:16,675 --> 00:01:17,699
One minute ago.

24
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:20,040
Okay. And how
do you feel?

25
00:01:20,112 --> 00:01:21,136
Angry.

26
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:23,147
All right. Did he hit you? No.

27
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:24,944
Did you cry?
No.

28
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:26,348
Did you feel like crying? No.

29
00:01:26,418 --> 00:01:29,148
I'm just going to write,
"Held back tears."

30
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:31,382
Wait, stop writing that.
That is not true.

31
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:32,651
If you stop crying,
I'll stop writing it.

32
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:33,816
I'm not...

33
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,024
I deserved that
promotion. Not Jim.

34
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:42,124
Oh, man, makes me want to put
him in a triangle choke hold

35
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:44,328
and force him
down to the ground

36
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:46,462
and just keep
pressing and pressing,

37
00:01:46,538 --> 00:01:51,305
and then flip him over and then put
him in a hammerlock and he's gasping.

38
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:53,367
He's panting for
every last breath.

39
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:57,848
And the crowd is going crazy
and boom, I emerge victorious!

40
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:01,882
Eighteen thousand dollars
and a chance at the title!

41
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:06,217
Dwight, Jim wants you
to keep it down.

42
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:43,253
Everyone, now would be
a good time to freshen up

43
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,625
because I'd like
everyone to meet

44
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:46,254
in the conference room
in five minutes.

45
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:47,696
And I suggest that
you bring a snack

46
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:49,199
because we may be
in there for a while.

47
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:50,292
Michael.
Yes.

48
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:51,961
Can I talk to you in my
office for a second? Mmm...

49
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:55,165
Sure. But could I first
talk to you in my office?

50
00:02:58,043 --> 00:03:00,034
Can I also be a boss?

51
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:01,545
Look, it doesn't
take a genius to know

52
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:04,980
that any organization thrives
when it has two leaders.

53
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:08,384
Go ahead, name a country that
doesn't have two presidents.

54
00:03:08,453 --> 00:03:11,217
A boat that set sail
without two captains.

55
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,157
Where would Catholicism be
without the popes?

56
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:15,659
I have noticed
that we...

57
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:17,092
Welcome.

58
00:03:17,162 --> 00:03:18,891
Thank you. I have
noticed we've been having

59
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,955
a lot of conference
room meetings. Mmm-hmm.

60
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:24,196
And I'm wondering if
perhaps those are a bit...

61
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:25,361
Disruptive.
Yes.

62
00:03:25,437 --> 00:03:29,897
No. I don't think they are. I think
the meetings are very important.

63
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:32,205
Okay. Maybe we
should talk specifics.

64
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:33,904
Let's do.
Okay.

65
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:36,846
Yesterday we had
a meeting about planets.

66
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:41,682
Well, to be fair,
Jim, James... Jimothy.

67
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:45,380
To be fair, Jimothy...
That sounds weird.

68
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:46,549
Are you okay with
being called Jim?

69
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,785
I am.
All right.

70
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:49,121
Jim, to be fair,

71
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:50,491
the conversation
wasn't about planets.

72
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:51,586
Right.

73
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:53,221
At first, we were
talking about

74
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:55,766
introducing a line
of toilet paper.

75
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:56,960
And what part
of the human body

76
00:03:57,035 --> 00:03:59,765
does one use
toilet paper upon?

77
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:03,138
So you draw a line from
there to the other planets,

78
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,675
and I think by the end, we all learned

79
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:06,540
a little bit about
how small we are.

80
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:07,772
Yes, I agree.
I just feel...

81
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:09,108
Because it's
a big universe.

82
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:12,480
And we're all just little
tiny specks of dust.

83
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:16,043
I just think that maybe they're
eating large amounts of the day.

84
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:18,316
You know what eats a large
amount of the day are naps.

85
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,620
You go to sleep, it's light
out, you wake up, it's dark.

86
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:24,526
That's the whole day. Where
did that day go? I have no idea.

87
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:27,397
You mean
on a weekend?

88
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,558
Yes.

89
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:32,365
How about this?
I think our goal should be

90
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:35,201
we don't have meetings unless
they're absolutely essential.

91
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:37,970
All right. No more
meetings this week.

92
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:40,705
Really?
You just agree to that?

93
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:42,406
I can be very
surprising.

94
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:50,581
What's going on?

95
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:53,147
I need to fit into
my wedding dress.

96
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,283
However,
I'm also pregnant.

97
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:00,688
You know, it's a myth
that women have to gain

98
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:03,030
more than nine pounds
in a pregnancy.

99
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:06,298
Look at these actresses.
Some of them lose weight.

100
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:09,969
Hey, did you guys register
for wedding gifts?

101
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:13,102
We did, but mostly because
people expect us to.

102
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,642
We're also accepting other
gifts not on the registry.

103
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:21,150
However much.

104
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:25,246
It's awkward asking people for
money. But we could really use it.

105
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:30,861
Why doesn't Crate and Barrel let you
register for a toaster full of cash?

106
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:32,590
Perfect.
I hate registries.

107
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:33,722
Oh, good.

108
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:37,758
My cousin makes the most amazing
romantic birdhouse mailboxes.

109
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:41,135
I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll
still be surprised when you see it.

110
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:43,436
You're not registered
for a birdhouse, are you?

111
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:44,975
No, we're not.

112
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:46,476
Good. Good.

113
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:52,946
Mmm-hmm.

114
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:55,883
Okay. I thought
I saw people missing.

115
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:59,981
Yeah. Just focus grouping a product
expansion idea to these folks.

116
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:01,548
Got one of each.
Really?

117
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:03,025
Hey, Stanley, what was
the last thing Michael said

118
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:04,119
before I came
through the door?

119
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:05,424
Stanley, you don't
need to answer that.

120
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:06,862
Stanley?

121
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:08,900
"If you don't smell
this, you're fired."

122
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:10,457
Okay, Michael,
I thought we agreed

123
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:12,696
to not take up people's time
with meetings like these.

124
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:15,672
What do you mean
by "these" people?

125
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:17,140
Michael, this is a
conference room meeting.

126
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:20,405
Oh, hey, everybody, I think
that Jim has gone insane

127
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,970
because he thinks that my
office is a conference room.

128
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,037
That's not
what I meant.

129
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:27,517
Listen, Jim, no offense,
but when push comes to shove,

130
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:30,077
what I want is more
important than what you want.

131
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:31,281
I disagree.

132
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:32,414
What do you
guys think?

133
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:34,118
Can
I go back to my desk now?

134
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:36,183
Great. Guys, can I just have a
moment alone with Michael, please?

135
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:37,853
No, no, no, no. You
don't need to go anywhere.

136
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:39,521
Anything that Jim
has to say to me,

137
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:41,793
he can say in front of
these types of people.

138
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:43,767
That is not what I said.

139
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:45,359
And also,
I am co-manager,

140
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:47,132
meaning you are not
the only manager anymore.

141
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:48,570
I am also a co-manager.

142
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,868
That is not what
Wallace told us.

143
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:51,067
That's exactly what
Wallace told us.

144
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:53,577
That is not the way
I heard it.

145
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:56,079
I love rivalries.
Michael or Jim,

146
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:59,845
Paris or Nicole, Heidi
or L.C., it's so much fun.

147
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:01,909
But I guess if I'm
really thinking about it,

148
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:03,921
and answering your
question honestly,

149
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:08,483
I'd have to go with L.C. Heidi's a
bad friend and her skin is terrible.

150
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,620
It is one thing me giving
you the co-manager title,

151
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:13,823
it is another thing
you bossing me around.

152
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:14,888
I'm not bossing you around.

153
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:17,161
I'm trying to do my job,
which is sharing your job.

154
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:19,066
So maybe we should
just call David Wallace.

155
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:21,264
No, no, no. No! We will
not call David Wallace.

156
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:22,670
I will call
David Wallace.

157
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:24,675
David Wallace is on
line two for you guys.

158
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:27,871
Or David Wallace will call us
on line two. Why don't we just...

159
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:29,743
Hey, David. You got
Jim here. Hey, David.

160
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:31,942
This is Michael,
senior co-manager.

161
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,578
Hey, guys. I'm
calling because unfortunately

162
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:38,649
we will not be
able to give out

163
00:07:38,723 --> 00:07:40,281
cost of living
raises this year

164
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:42,189
and I know
people expect it.

165
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:45,320
However, there just is only a small
amount of money for each branch.

166
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:47,695
So, we're leaving
it up to the managers

167
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:49,256
to decide how
to distribute it.

168
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:53,395
Got it, Dave. Sounds like your
classic big picture decision.

169
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:56,236
Which will clearly affect the
day-to-day wellbeing of our employees.

170
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:57,536
It's probably
a little of both.

171
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:58,667
Which is it more of?

172
00:07:58,743 --> 00:07:59,835
Excuse me?
Hey, David,

173
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:01,173
I know that I am
very new at this,

174
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:03,237
but I have a very good
perspective on how things work...

175
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:06,614
Wait, I'm sorry. Michael,
are you texting me?

176
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,279
I thought maybe we could
talk after this is over.

177
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:12,448
Look, I need you both
to take care of this.

178
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:14,651
This is not going to
be a problem, is it?

179
00:08:14,726 --> 00:08:15,715
Nope, not at all.
Not at all. Nope.

180
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:16,818
No, it will not be.

181
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,884
I am on top of it.
Very good.

182
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:19,726
All right. Thanks a lot,
David. Talk to you later...

183
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:22,562
Okay, you didn't
let me say goodbye.

184
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:26,199
All right, I am looking
forward to this.

185
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:27,295
You don't have to lie.

186
00:08:27,372 --> 00:08:29,966
I hate the fact that we have
to do this together.

187
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,906
I think we work
much better separately.

188
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:36,107
When I am irritated and I look
at you, I don't see you anymore.

189
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:37,512
Right.
All I can see

190
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:39,914
is how big and gross
the pores on your nose are.

191
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:42,180
All right.
Let's get started.

192
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,892
Hey, why haven't we ever...

193
00:08:50,962 --> 00:08:52,190
We have.

194
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:57,758
You know, there's no
easy way to do this.

195
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:01,397
I say we add 1.5%
to their paychecks

196
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:03,338
and don't say
anything about it.

197
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:05,467
Do you mean, like, break in,
in the middle of the night

198
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:06,772
and change the numbers
on payroll?

199
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:08,369
No, we can do it
during the day.

200
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:09,879
It doesn't have to be
that dramatic, Jim.

201
00:09:09,948 --> 00:09:11,313
Okay.

202
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:15,911
You know what would help is a
pros and cons list for our options.

203
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,811
Jim, don't take this
the wrong way.

204
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:19,857
Are you going to take
this the wrong way?

205
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:20,949
It's hard to tell so far.

206
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:22,357
You use your brain
too much.

207
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:24,224
I'm sorry, are you
advocating that I use it less?

208
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:27,390
Sometimes the smartest
people don't think at all.

209
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:29,262
You just came up with
that. As I was saying it.

210
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:30,665
Yeah.

211
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:35,297
Okay, so for the 1.5% increase,
pro, everyone gets a little bit.

212
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:37,204
Con, you look
like a nerd.

213
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:40,039
Con, no one gets as much
as they did last year.

214
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:43,376
Pro, you get to share your pros
and cons list with the other nerds.

215
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:45,245
Pro, no favoritism.

216
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:48,218
Con, you unzip your pants
and you'll find

217
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:50,186
that there's a calculator down there.

218
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:53,352
I've been studying
Michael for years

219
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:56,553
and I've condensed what
I've learned into this chart.

220
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:58,186
How Michael
spends his time.

221
00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:01,130
As you can see, we have
procrastinating and distracting others.

222
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:04,362
And this tiny sliver here
is critical thinking.

223
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,938
I made it bigger so that
you could see it.

224
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:14,568
Hey, Pam. I heard that you were
registered, but I didn't hear where.

225
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:20,240
I don't think we registered
anywhere. We just want cash.

226
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:24,817
Like money? Like,
you want my money?

227
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:26,184
Mmm-hmm.

228
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:28,256
Will you take a check?

229
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:29,817
Yeah.

230
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:30,883
Cool.

231
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:38,261
In the memo line, I'm going to
write, "To love's eternal glory."

232
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:40,627
Okay.

233
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:41,899
Wait till Monday.

234
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:48,208
Is this what I've become?
Materialistic? Shallow?

235
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:54,207
I feel horrible. Oh,
look! "Mrs. Pam Halpert!"

236
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:58,413
That's the first time
I've seen it in writing.

237
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:01,024
You know what,
the more I think about it,

238
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:04,220
the more I think we should
give it to the salesmen.

239
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:05,557
That will not
go over well.

240
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,257
Yeah, I know, I just
think it seems smart

241
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:08,959
to keep the salesmen
happier right now.

242
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:11,229
Of course, I know this
might come off as biased,

243
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:13,736
so you know what?
Let us...

244
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:15,238
Oh, my God,
are you going to make

245
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:16,933
another pro and con list?
I'm going to kill myself.

246
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:18,771
Well, I'm not going to let
you stop me from thinking.

247
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:20,743
No, I could not
do that, Jim.

248
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:23,007
I can see it in your
crusty little eyes

249
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:25,208
that you are going to make
everything perfect.

250
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:28,081
"If I could just
think this through,

251
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:30,781
"if I could just
think it exactly right,

252
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:33,119
"I can make this perfect.

253
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:35,726
"And then I can go
down every avenue,

254
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:37,853
"and every avenue
off of that avenue.

255
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:39,419
"And then another avenue..." Michael.

256
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:40,486
"And then another."

257
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:41,759
Look, you have
a lot of strengths.

258
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,733
Oh, I do?
Tell me what they are.

259
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:46,293
I think that you
are able to take

260
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:47,702
constructive criticism
very well.

261
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:50,639
Ha! That, I am not
known for that.

262
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,540
But there is a reason
why I'm here.

263
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,271
Yes, you went over
my head to Wallace.

264
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:56,836
No, it's because you also have
a lot of weaknesses, Michael.

265
00:11:56,915 --> 00:12:00,681
Okay, well, why don't you
tell me what those are, Jim?

266
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:02,185
Why don't you
enliven me?

267
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:03,982
I don't think you're good
at making tough decisions.

268
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:05,079
Ah!

269
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:08,592
At thinking out the options and then
stating that decision very clearly,

270
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,628
especially when it's
an unpopular decision.

271
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:13,994
Okay. Here's a tough decision
for you, you suck. You suck.

272
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:15,760
Michael, wait. Is that
clear enough for you?

273
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:21,136
Maybe I'm here for a reason, because
I might have some good ideas, too.

274
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:23,436
I've been sitting out there
and I've been learning a lot

275
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:26,636
and maybe I can just bring
something different to the table.

276
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,144
Okay, Skippy, here we go.

277
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:31,444
Why don't you run yourself
out there and tell them?

278
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,482
You call it.

279
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:41,424
This had better be terrible.

280
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:42,983
Could I have everyone's
attention, please?

281
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:46,053
I have some tough news, so I'm just
going to give it to you straight.

282
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:48,998
Truth is we only have so much
money for raises this year.

283
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:50,056
So the simple fact is,

284
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:52,535
some people will get raises
and some people won't.

285
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:54,196
Now what
we've decided is

286
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:56,900
we are going to give those
raises to the sales staff.

287
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:58,272
Wait, seriously?

288
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:01,506
Look, you guys are smart,
so I'm just leveling with you,

289
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:03,069
just trying to treat
you like adults.

290
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:06,549
Thank you, Jim, for thinking
that we're smart people.

291
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:08,245
But I do not understand.

292
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:11,720
If we're such smart adults,
then why don't we get raises?

293
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,485
Excellent question,
genius.

294
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:15,150
It's because Jim wants
to give the raises

295
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:17,091
to his friends and the
people he sleeps with.

296
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:18,220
Ooh! Easy,
that's not it at all.

297
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:19,285
Well?

298
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:20,763
Really, what it is,
is about the money

299
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:22,459
the sales staff brings
in to the office...

300
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:23,523
What's going on?

301
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:26,434
Jim is only giving raises
to the salesmen.

302
00:13:26,604 --> 00:13:28,469
What the hell? Why are
you being such a jerk?

303
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,202
Hold on, Kelly, would it help you
to know that Jim thinks you're smart?

304
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:34,507
No. How is that going
to repair Ryan's car?

305
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:37,104
This is ridiculous!
How can he do this to us?

306
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:38,376
Okay, Dwight,
you know what?

307
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:39,677
You'd be getting
the raise, so...

308
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:42,447
What about all these people?
How is it fair to them?

309
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,612
- Exactly.
- Totally.

310
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:46,248
We work just as hard as the
salespeople, we deserve raises.

311
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:47,313
Yes.
Yes.

312
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:49,019
They don't get them
if we don't get them.

313
00:13:49,093 --> 00:13:52,756
My kid needs shoes. You want to
tell him he doesn't get shoes?

314
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:53,820
Yeah.

315
00:13:53,898 --> 00:13:55,195
Her kid needs shoes, Jim.

316
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:56,756
What the hell?

317
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,874
Wow. I'm just going to rewind
and back off a bit, so...

318
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:15,684
That was good.
That was good.

319
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:18,378
Okay, all right.
Well, we all know

320
00:14:18,456 --> 00:14:19,787
it's hard to be
a boss, right?

321
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:23,851
You know what? Look around you,
these are your best friends.

322
00:14:24,295 --> 00:14:29,096
These are the people who
will open their hearts to you.

323
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:33,399
They all have
heart-ons for you.

324
00:14:33,972 --> 00:14:35,701
And that is a gift.

325
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:39,608
So in terms of gifts, we should
be giving each other gifts.

326
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:43,238
Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar.

327
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:44,679
This is... What are you
talking about? Michael!

328
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:47,582
We just need to hear
your plan for our raise.

329
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:51,918
My plan, a man, Panama.

330
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:53,986
That's not how that goes.

331
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:56,993
You're not saying anything. At
least Jim was being direct...

332
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:58,050
Thank you, Meredith.

333
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:59,687
...when he was telling us
his dumb-ass plan.

334
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:01,129
We would just like
to know what's happening.

335
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,190
Are we getting a raise,
yes or no?

336
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:05,600
All right, let me get this cleared.
Does everybody want a raise?

337
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,864
Yes!

338
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:08,769
All right,
everyone wants a raise,

339
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,604
so what we're going
to do is go into here

340
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:13,803
and we will not
come out until we do.

341
00:15:14,345 --> 00:15:15,573
Again, that gives us
no information.

342
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:18,741
This isn't a game,
you know, it's our livelihood.

343
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:24,020
What about a raise
based on merit?

344
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:25,851
Rank each person
individually.

345
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,789
Mmm-hmm.
Piece of cake.

346
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:29,859
Ryan is obviously
the best.

347
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:31,623
Obviously.
Too bad he's a temp

348
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:33,129
and doesn't count,
so let's get started.

349
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:34,494
Are you making a...

350
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:36,590
Nope, I'm numbering the paper.

351
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:38,533
Just...
Yeah. I don't understand

352
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:40,969
how they can even
consider giving money

353
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,371
to some people
and not the rest of us.

354
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:45,841
It's not like we're not going to
see the checks, we're in Accounting.

355
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,673
I am so pissed
at this company.

356
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:48,734
And Jim.

357
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:50,940
Yeah.
Who said that?

358
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:53,077
I think it was Creed.

359
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:54,140
Yep.

360
00:15:58,823 --> 00:16:00,688
It's going really
well, actually. Mmm-hmm.

361
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:03,488
Each Boston baked bean
represents half-a-percent raise.

362
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:04,550
We each got 24 beans,

363
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:06,961
so the idea is,
you place the bean

364
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:09,864
on the picture of who
you think deserves...

365
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:11,731
Who's that?
Toby.

366
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:13,168
Okay, he's not a part
of this, you know that.

367
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:15,171
Just wanted to draw
a picture of him.

368
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:16,638
Okay, your move.

369
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,266
All right. Who to pick?

370
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,234
Who to pick?

371
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:21,335
Here we go.

372
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:25,314
I will skip a turn.

373
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:27,544
Okay, you're going to still have
to play that bean, you know that.

374
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:28,949
I need more time.

375
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,087
Wallace sent an email
about a meeting next week,

376
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:40,392
he wants you
both to respond.

377
00:16:57,281 --> 00:17:00,478
People are starting to notice
how terrible Jim is.

378
00:17:00,551 --> 00:17:03,918
It's great. Eventually,
they will rise up and revolt.

379
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:07,219
My only hope is that they do
it sooner rather than later.

380
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,486
If the people here were
our Founding Fathers,

381
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,358
the Revolutionary War would
have been delayed 10 years

382
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,593
because Stanley Washington
was napping.

383
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:20,000
And Phyllis Hancock was
still signing the Declaration,

384
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:24,235
and Kevin Jefferson was
distracted by a butterfly.

385
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:28,972
Come on in. That's right.
Come in, feast your eyes.

386
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:33,347
They determine our worth
by putting beans on our faces.

387
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:34,442
What the hell?

388
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,885
Things were not this bad
when just Michael was manager.

389
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:38,353
Hey, what are you guys
doing in here?

390
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:39,651
What does a bean mean?

391
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:44,354
Why aren't there any beans on this
very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?

392
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:46,761
Michael,
what does a bean mean?

393
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:47,889
Jim?

394
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:48,989
I was just trying
to be unbiased.

395
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,398
What does a bean mean?

396
00:17:50,468 --> 00:17:51,560
Someone please
explain it to Kevin.

397
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:54,161
Why can't you? My time is
just as valuable as yours.

398
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:55,967
Not according
to the beans.

399
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,440
This is how you make
this important decision?

400
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:02,707
There's no way that Stanley gets more
beans than me, that is ridiculous.

401
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:05,778
This is how it works.

402
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:09,518
It's not so much that I might
not get a raise, it's just demeaning.

403
00:18:09,587 --> 00:18:14,456
Thank you. That is exactly... But,
by the way, I would also like a raise.

404
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:16,288
Yeah, I would, too.

405
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,827
Are we idiots?

406
00:18:20,531 --> 00:18:23,432
What right does
Jim have to claim authority?

407
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,263
Is he as good
a salesman as I?

408
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:29,238
Is he as matronly
as Phyllis?

409
00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:33,336
There are moments where
we can affect change.

410
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:38,405
For a few seconds,
every decade, we exist.

411
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,244
And these are those seconds.
Let us storm his castle.

412
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,154
Come on, tick,
let's get him, tock.

413
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:51,928
Let's get Jim. Tick, and drag
Jim out of his office, tock,

414
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:55,363
take his keys away from
him, tick, that's a clock.

415
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:58,869
The time is getting very
close. It's now or never.

416
00:18:58,936 --> 00:19:00,426
What say you?

417
00:19:01,806 --> 00:19:02,898
I say no.

418
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:05,636
No, I mean, what do you say to my plan?

419
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,542
Michael Scott...
Security guard.

420
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:12,105
Michael,
will you help us?

421
00:19:14,218 --> 00:19:15,651
What does
a bean mean?

422
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:21,958
How you doing?

423
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:25,018
On a scale of one to 10,
I'd say I'm about a four.

424
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:27,296
What are you usually?

425
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:29,265
Six. You?

426
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,166
Usually a 10, but I'm
feeling like a zero.

427
00:19:32,236 --> 00:19:33,794
I mean,
a performance-based raise

428
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:35,304
sounded like
a good idea, right?

429
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:36,897
I know, I know.

430
00:19:36,974 --> 00:19:38,441
We tried to find
the fairest way to do it.

431
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:39,567
Yes, we did.

432
00:19:39,644 --> 00:19:41,009
I just...

433
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:45,440
What?

434
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,976
Um...

435
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:49,142
Nothing. I just...

436
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,883
I used to have to do this part
alone. And it was the worst.

437
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:58,086
I have something
I would like to give you.

438
00:19:58,162 --> 00:20:00,653
Michael, come on!
This isn't fair! KEVIN: Michael!

439
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:04,668
Michael's my only friend
left in the office.

440
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:08,535
Except Pam. I think.

441
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,968
She still upset?

442
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:15,340
Michael, you cannot
just keep avoiding us like this.

443
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:19,738
Thank you.

444
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:20,806
You're welcome.

445
00:20:22,987 --> 00:20:24,477
What's in here?

446
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:25,613
Gin.

447
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:36,591
Ooh.

448
00:20:44,675 --> 00:20:46,267
Just
pretend we're not here.

449
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:51,739
Heard you guys are looking
for cash for the wedding?

450
00:20:51,816 --> 00:20:54,114
Yeah, I mean, if it's
all the same for you.

451
00:20:54,185 --> 00:20:55,209
Question for you,

452
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:59,416
would you guys rather have $100
now or $5,000 a year from now?

453
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,821
$100 now, for sure.

454
00:21:00,891 --> 00:21:03,621
Because you just give me
$50 to cover the broker fee,

455
00:21:03,694 --> 00:21:06,162
I put in $100 of my
own money, as the gift.

456
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,757
Yeah. No, no. The $100.
I'll just take the $100.

457
00:21:10,835 --> 00:21:13,269
Instead of
$5,000 a year from now?

458
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:16,230
How sure is this?

459
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:17,831
The guy has an algorithm

460
00:21:17,908 --> 00:21:21,674
to determine the winner of any
given college basketball game.

461
00:21:27,785 --> 00:21:29,184
Don't tell Jim.
