1
00:00:03,202 --> 00:00:04,863
Dunder Mifflin
is about to be sold,

2
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:08,566
but first an investment banker has
to drop by and sign off on our branch.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,474
And I'm pretty
nervous about it,

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:17,311
and I'm making
some cosmetic tweaks

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,986
to help create
a more appealing environment.

6
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:25,487
Is that dishonest?
Well, think of it this way.

7
00:00:25,557 --> 00:00:27,047
When you look in
the mirror and you see

8
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:28,593
your push-up bra and
your fake eyelashes

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,754
and your makeup and
your press-on nails,

10
00:00:32,898 --> 00:00:35,526
the principles that
I'm applying to the office

11
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:38,729
are the same ones that
have made Lady Gaga a star.

12
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:40,704
Or any number of drag queens.

13
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:08,697
Hi.
- Hello, Eric Ward.

14
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:11,995
Welcome to Dunder Mifflin.

15
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:16,269
I am Computron,
your answer to everything.

16
00:01:17,176 --> 00:01:18,803
Hello.
Hello.

17
00:01:18,877 --> 00:01:21,311
I see you've met Computron,
our virtual helper.

18
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,315
I'm Michael Scott.
Welcome, welcome.

19
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:28,012
Computron is just one
of the many modern devices

20
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:31,056
that I have incorporated
into the office.

21
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:32,784
Watch this. Computron?
Yes.

22
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:35,088
What is the world's
largest ocean?

23
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,354
Calculating.

24
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:38,828
Calculating.

25
00:01:38,897 --> 00:01:40,091
Pacific!

26
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:42,895
Pacific Ocean.
Pretty cool, huh?

27
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:43,992
Great news, Michael,

28
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:46,697
we're now the official
paper supplier of the NFL.

29
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:50,708
That is fantastic. It's good, but
it's not good enough. Keep working.

30
00:01:51,343 --> 00:01:52,503
And here's Pam.

31
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:54,011
She's our international
sales consultant.

32
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,103
Hello.

33
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:01,016
The NFL celebrated
its 50th anniversary in 1972.

34
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,821
It might seem crazy, but since
there's no one left in New York,

35
00:02:08,894 --> 00:02:12,330
Michael is Dunder Mifflin's
highest ranking employee.

36
00:02:13,398 --> 00:02:15,366
So, that's where we are.

37
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:16,859
Hello, Stanley.

38
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:17,924
Hi.

39
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,730
For the record, not
on board with fake Stanley.

40
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:25,236
Although, I get it.

41
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,935
I just need to check out your
warehouse and then talk to your HR guy.

42
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:30,243
That is pretty much the only
reason that I came here today.

43
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:32,146
Okay. Well, I thought I'd
show you around a little bit...

44
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:33,775
Right... Since you made the trip out.

45
00:02:33,852 --> 00:02:36,980
And I got us reservations at
Coopers Seafood. You like lobster?

46
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:38,113
You've had
lobster before, right?

47
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,214
Yeah.

48
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,317
They make the best Maine lobster
in the world. You'll love it.

49
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:44,487
Mul Yam
in Tel Aviv is better.

50
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:47,896
No, Computron, actually,
I think Coopers is the best.

51
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:49,126
You're going to love it.

52
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:51,362
Are you calling me wrong?

53
00:02:51,436 --> 00:02:52,596
Oh, my God.

54
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,140
It's called
due diligence.

55
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:57,265
Basically,
I confirm inventory,

56
00:02:57,342 --> 00:03:00,743
take a head count, see if
there are any HR liabilities.

57
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:03,310
I'm a glorified fact checker.

58
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,514
Actually,
I am a fact checker.

59
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,819
All right.

60
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:12,622
Excuse me. If you will...
- Hey, Michael,

61
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:14,658
do you think I could get a space
here? Follow me this way.

62
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:17,957
I will introduce you to the
crack HR rep that you requested.

63
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,864
I give you Toby Flenderson.
Have fun, you two.

64
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:24,765
Oh, we will. Have a seat.

65
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:30,165
Mmm.

66
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:33,769
I left a copy of
Best American Mystery Stories 1999

67
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:37,611
in Toby's favorite stall. So,
yes, I think I bought us some time.

68
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,817
So, the manager,
Michael Scott

69
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:45,451
is a bit of a character.

70
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:48,220
He has more character in a
single flake of his dandruff

71
00:03:48,293 --> 00:03:51,820
than you have in that entire
snow bank on your shoulder.

72
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:54,130
So, what was the question?

73
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,190
What are you
doing at my desk?

74
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:58,360
Ignore him.
He's the local lunatic.

75
00:03:58,437 --> 00:04:00,098
Come on, Dwight,
get out of here.

76
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,934
Dwight? Who is this Dwight?

77
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:03,065
Oh!

78
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:05,342
You mean Dwight Schrute,

79
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,709
the company's top salesman
and the creator of Computron.

80
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,305
I wear many hats, but the
one I'm wearing currently

81
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:12,372
is that of gracious host.

82
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:15,314
Welcome.

83
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:21,723
Sorry. Hey, Toby Flenderson.
Nice to meet you. How can I help?

84
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:25,862
Are there any outstanding
liability issues to be aware of?

85
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:26,989
What do you mean?

86
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:31,263
Well, safety issues,
injuries that could leave

87
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:34,396
the company open to
any potential lawsuits.

88
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:36,133
Um...

89
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,067
Nothing comes to mind.

90
00:04:38,143 --> 00:04:39,735
Mike, get off
of the lift. Please!

91
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:40,800
Come on, now.

92
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:41,971
I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

93
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:43,639
Look, would you...
Look...

94
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:52,050
We'll get somebody
to clean that up.

95
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:53,588
We're the ones
that gotta clean that up!

96
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:55,181
I feel very blessed.

97
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:06,463
Drop that sucker.

98
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:08,973
Yeah! Bingo!

99
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:14,602
Do it!
Yeah!

100
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,189
Today, smoking is
going to save lives.

101
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,949
- Run, run.
- Okay, okay.

102
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,688
Calm, please.

103
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:31,820
Oscar!

104
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:33,194
Stay alive, I'm getting help!

105
00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:34,698
Pull me up!
You're too heavy.

106
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:35,994
I only weigh 82 pounds.

107
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,602
Save Bandit!

108
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:44,598
Seriously, are you
gonna sit in the back?

109
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:47,844
Yeah. It's the safest
part of a car.

110
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:51,246
In the event of a crash, the driver
always protects his side first.

111
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:06,853
My hair!

112
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:09,997
Get off! Get off me!

113
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:11,057
I got it! I got it!

114
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:12,398
Get it off!

115
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,273
You're welcome.

116
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:29,385
So, the staff,
are people generally happy?

117
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:37,295
Happy is a funny word.

118
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:39,395
In what way?

119
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:40,930
You know...

120
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:45,460
You know, what does
it mean to be happy?

121
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:50,701
Keep philosophers
busy for a while.

122
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:53,074
So, generally?

123
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:54,203
Yes.

124
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:56,270
Generally.
Generally happy.

125
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:57,610
Generally happy.

126
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:07,418
I don't know what streets
we... Ow! What are you doing?

127
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:08,959
It would be better
if you were unconscious.

128
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:11,419
Ow!

129
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:14,363
Try my googy googy. Try
my googy googy. Try my...

130
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:17,494
Excuse me.
Don't touch me!

131
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,667
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

132
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,832
Can't we all just get along?

133
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:28,107
Or have we forgotten the words
of the Reverend King?

134
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:32,873
What about non-safety issues
in terms of liability?

135
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:35,181
Sexual harassment?
Anything like that?

136
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,550
Well, I don't know.

137
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:41,420
You don't know?

138
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,750
I don't know.

139
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:45,891
You're the head
of human resources.

140
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:46,988
I don't know.

141
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:48,089
No.
Okay.

142
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:53,604
Stanley? How about that hot
picture you have by your desk?

143
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:55,697
Centerfold in the
Catholic schoolgirl's outfit?

144
00:07:55,774 --> 00:07:58,971
I mean, it is hot, it is sexy,
and it turns him on.

145
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:03,037
And I will admit, best part
of my morning is staring at it.

146
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:04,672
But what? Are we gonna
just take it away?

147
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:07,718
That is my daughter, she goes
to Catholic girls' school.

148
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:10,515
Michael.
Come in!

149
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:12,849
Hey!
Oh, my God!

150
00:08:12,924 --> 00:08:14,016
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

151
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:15,354
You said, come in! No, I didn't!

152
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:17,190
Just, please, get out. Oh, my God!

153
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:20,022
What's wrong
with my outfit?

154
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:22,862
You might consider
pulling it down a touch.

155
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:25,562
Bunch of prudes. You know,
Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,

156
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:27,400
But I'm not
allowed to wear open-toed shoes?

157
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:28,939
Is that how it goes?

158
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:30,269
Meredith, your boob is out.

159
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:31,400
Fine.

160
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:33,307
Too
far, Meredith! Too far!

161
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:35,312
Damn it, Meredith,
where are your panties?

162
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,677
It's casual day.

163
00:08:36,748 --> 00:08:38,545
Come here, give me a kiss,
come on.

164
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:40,949
Michael, come on, you
don't have to worry. I'm not

165
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:43,954
gonna report you to HR.
I'm not... I'm not worried!

166
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:45,887
You know what? The only
thing I am worried about

167
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,354
is getting a boner.

168
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:52,586
I'm now going to read aloud your
submitted medical conditions.

169
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:54,723
When you hear yours read,
please raise your hand

170
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,164
to indicate
that it is real.

171
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:59,135
If you do not raise your
hand, it will not be covered.

172
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:01,297
Number one,
inverted penis.

173
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:08,643
Could you mean vagina? Because
if you do, I want that covered.

174
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:11,409
I thought your vagina was
removed during your hysterectomy.

175
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:16,580
A uterus is different from a
vagina. I still have a vagina.

176
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:21,853
Attention, everyone. Hello.

177
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:25,658
Yes, I just want you to know
that, this is not my decision.

178
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,392
You can consider this
my retirement from comedy.

179
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:31,264
Does that include
"that's what she said"?

180
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:33,628
Yes.

181
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:35,605
Wow, that is really hard.

182
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:39,975
You really think
you can go all day long?

183
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:44,611
Well, you always left me
satisfied and smiling, so...

184
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:47,746
That's what she said!

185
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:49,548
Michael!

186
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:51,483
Why did you
get it so big?

187
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:53,114
That's what she said.

188
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,722
Does the skin look
red and swollen?

189
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:57,261
That's what she said.

190
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:59,627
That's my joke.
Damn it, Dwight.

191
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:02,258
How about
the Phyllis-Angela dispute?

192
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:03,494
You already did me.

193
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:05,001
That's what she said.

194
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,230
Is there any mustard?

195
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:09,432
No mustard! No mustard!
Just eat it!

196
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:11,065
Eat it, Phyllis.
Dip it in the water

197
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:12,666
so it'll slide down
your gullet more easily.

198
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:13,802
That's what she said.

199
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:14,867
Oh,
no, no, no, no, not that...

200
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:16,641
Just come on,
you guys, let's do it.

201
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,514
I don't know how
I'm going to get through this.

202
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:27,620
I don't want to lie.

203
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:30,484
And I don't want
to tell the truth.

204
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:36,495
Hey, Tobes, what you doing?
What you guys talking about?

205
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:38,798
We're just going
over some stuff.

206
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,963
Stuff? I love stuff.

207
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,472
It's HR stuff.

208
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,340
HR stuff? H.R. Pufnstuf.

209
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:50,339
Right up my alley. What is
that? What kind of stuff is that?

210
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:52,975
It's a company
evaluation form.

211
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:54,075
Ah!

212
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:55,208
We're talking about...

213
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:57,151
Talking about what?

214
00:10:58,056 --> 00:10:59,045
Waste is next.

215
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:00,318
Waste?

216
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:03,321
What does that even mean?
Like garbage?

217
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:04,862
No, waste of time,
resources.

218
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:06,692
Oh! Time and resources.

219
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:08,926
Look, you know,
in any company,

220
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,126
there's gonna be
a certain degree...

221
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:14,535
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Respectfully, Toby, no.

222
00:11:14,606 --> 00:11:17,439
No. This company does not
waste time or resources ever.

223
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:33,152
Dig deep. Dig deep.

224
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,687
It's Phyllis,
Phyllis by a nose.

225
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:40,526
Gold medal in Flernenton.
Flonkerton.

226
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,793
Where is my desk?

227
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:45,427
That is weird.

228
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:49,898
Happy holidays, Dwight. But
do not open it till Christmas.

229
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:51,965
You're so pathetic. Well,
I hope it was worth it,

230
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:54,773
because I'm going to take it
apart in about five minutes.

231
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:56,438
I think it'll take you a
little bit longer than that.

232
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:59,210
If I can skin a mule deer
in less than 10 minutes,

233
00:11:59,284 --> 00:12:00,444
I ought to be
able to cut my...

234
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:06,120
Damn it! Jim!

235
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:07,658
Okay. Hold on, hold on.

236
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,194
Judge is in session.
What is the problem here?

237
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:11,990
He put my stuff
in Jell-O again.

238
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:16,967
Bang, boom,
shake, klump!

239
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:20,227
Why, hello, everybody.

240
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,936
What are you doing?

241
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:28,274
Question, what kind
of bear is best?

242
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:30,474
That's a ridiculous question.

243
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:32,345
False. Black bear.

244
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:33,941
Well, that's debatable.

245
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:35,451
There are basically
two schools of thought.

246
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,886
Fact, bears eat beets.
Oh...

247
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:40,481
Bears, beets,

248
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:42,753
Battlestar Galactica.
Bears do not...

249
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:46,091
What is going on?
What are you doing?

250
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,259
Identity theft is
not a joke, Jim!

251
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:52,995
Millions of families
suffer every year!

252
00:12:54,072 --> 00:12:55,300
Michael!

253
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:57,466
Oh, that's funny. Michael!

254
00:12:57,642 --> 00:12:59,269
Is anyone near
retirement age?

255
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:03,874
This is Creed.

256
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:06,382
And he is in charge
of something.

257
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:07,543
Right?
That is correct.

258
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:09,246
Say hi to the kids.
Hi, kids.

259
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,412
Yay!

260
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:13,355
- Have you ever seen a foot with four toes?
- Ew!

261
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:16,484
What are you doing? Stop it!
Stop it! Just... No, no, no, no, no!

262
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:17,550
Would you cut it out?

263
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:19,696
Okay. Ryan, you told Toby

264
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:23,222
that Creed has a distinct
old man smell?

265
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:27,229
I know exactly
what he's talking about.

266
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:30,832
I sprout mung beans on a damp
paper towel in my desk drawer.

267
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:33,707
Very nutritious,
but they smell like death.

268
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,005
Hey, where's Dwight?

269
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:37,273
You didn't hear?

270
00:13:37,348 --> 00:13:42,081
Decapitated. Whole big thing.
We had a funeral for a bird.

271
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:45,756
I'm pretty sure
none of that's real.

272
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,257
You're not real, man.

273
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:53,057
Hey. Yeah, I finally got a
chance to sit down with HR.

274
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:55,425
So...

275
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:58,532
Well, I think I'm gonna
be here for a while.

276
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:05,098
This is a building where
friends become lovers,

277
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:11,110
and lovers become
sexually interactive, right?

278
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:12,240
Would you agree with that?

279
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:14,717
Michael, this is really
inappropriate to talk about.

280
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:16,253
That is true.

281
00:14:16,454 --> 00:14:17,546
Mmm.

282
00:14:31,102 --> 00:14:32,569
I like you.

283
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:36,069
But you need to access
your un-crazy side.

284
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,940
Darryl Philbin is the most
complicated man that I've ever met.

285
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:42,641
I mean, who says exactly
what they're thinking?

286
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:46,382
What kind of game is that?

287
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:49,985
I am so happy we don't
have to break up now, Ryan!

288
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:53,080
It is the best day
of my whole life!

289
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,226
When I said that
I wanted to have kids,

290
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:59,923
and you said that you wanted me
to have a vasectomy, what did I do?

291
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:02,489
And then, when you said that
you might want to have kids,

292
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:05,536
and I wasn't so sure, who
had the vasectomy reversed?

293
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:07,594
And then when you said you
definitely didn't want to have kids?

294
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:08,934
Who had it reversed back?

295
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:11,168
Snip, snap! Snip, snap! Snip, snap!

296
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:12,368
I did!
- Okay...

297
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:17,642
You have no idea the physical toll
that three vasectomies have on a person!

298
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,611
Kelly, I'm your
boss now, okay?

299
00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:21,743
You can't keep talking to
me like I'm your boyfriend.

300
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:25,118
Oh, big strong man,
fancy new whatever.

301
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:26,349
I don't think you
ever cared about me.

302
00:15:26,424 --> 00:15:27,550
I never cared about you?

303
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,388
Six months ago, Karen
Filippelli sent me an email,

304
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,155
asked me out,
I said no,

305
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:32,890
because I was committed
to our relationship.

306
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:35,524
Well, I hope you're still
committed, because I'm pregnant.

307
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,237
This is an image

308
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:45,566
that I want you people to
remember for a long time to come.

309
00:15:45,643 --> 00:15:46,905
Whenever you come
into the office,

310
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:48,946
I want you to
think about this.

311
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:51,075
We don't need to.

312
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:52,514
Yes, we do.
What?

313
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:09,828
I did it!

314
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:13,600
Thank you.
Thank you.

315
00:16:13,738 --> 00:16:16,229
Jim has got it bad for Pam.

316
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:18,775
Oh! Which one is Pam?

317
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:22,274
What?
Nothing.

318
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,411
Okay.
What?

319
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,649
I don't know. What?

320
00:16:28,786 --> 00:16:29,810
Oh, my God!

321
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:31,811
Did you wanna
tell me something?

322
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:34,255
You look like you want
to tell me something.

323
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:36,259
You look like you have
something really important to say

324
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:38,818
and you just can't
for some reason.

325
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:42,524
Come on, you can tell me.

326
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,734
Jim, you can tell me anything.

327
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:55,007
You have new music?

328
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,137
Yeah.

329
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:58,480
Definitely.

330
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:11,685
Bring it in.
Here we go.

331
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,100
Look inside.

332
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:24,740
Oh, my God!

333
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:31,415
But I bet Jim got the job.

334
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:35,646
I mean, why wouldn't he? He's
totally qualified and smart.

335
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,085
Everyone loves him.

336
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:39,089
If he never comes back again,

337
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:40,556
that's okay.

338
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:42,521
We're friends.

339
00:17:42,593 --> 00:17:44,424
We just... We never
got the timing right.

340
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:46,122
But you know what,
it's okay.

341
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:48,996
I'm totally fine.

342
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,329
Everything is
going to be totally...

343
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:51,629
Pam.

344
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:52,794
Sorry.

345
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:55,767
Are you free for
dinner tonight?

346
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,633
Yes.

347
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,142
All right.
Then it's a date.

348
00:18:08,886 --> 00:18:10,717
I'm sorry.
What was the question?

349
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:13,155
Oh, my God.

350
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,293
Pam, will you marry me?

351
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:19,454
Oh, my God!

352
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:04,102
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

353
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:06,006
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

354
00:19:06,077 --> 00:19:07,510
It's nice to meet you all.

355
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:08,602
Good to meet you.

356
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:09,737
Have a great day.
Thank you.

357
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:11,372
- Hope to see
you soon. - Yeah.

358
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:13,679
I feel very sorry
for that banker because

359
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:16,083
he has to evaluate
what we are worth.

360
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:20,990
He has to decide what we're
capable of. And how do you do that?

361
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:27,190
What is Jim capable of?
Or Pam? Or Kevin?

362
00:19:28,699 --> 00:19:31,293
Out of paper, out of stock

363
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:34,704
Those friendly faces
around the block

364
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:36,797
Break loose
from the chains

365
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:39,436
That are causing
you pain

366
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,604
Call Michael
and Stanley, Jim, Dwight, Creed

367
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,047
Call Andy and Kelly
For your business paper needs

368
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:47,641
Dunder Mifflin

369
00:19:47,718 --> 00:19:49,310
The people person's
paper people

370
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:50,854
Dunder Mifflin

371
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:52,446
The people person's
paper people

372
00:19:52,523 --> 00:19:53,854
Dunder Mifflin

373
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:55,222
The people person's
paper people

374
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:58,057
I don't care if he
goes and files a report

375
00:19:58,129 --> 00:19:59,790
that says that
we're nothing special

376
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:03,994
because I think our
future is very bright.

377
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:06,265
We have only just begun.

378
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:09,568
Computron
experiencing emotion.

379
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,508
Computron, I'm going to
pull your plug, okay, buddy?

380
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:16,103
Okay.
Just...

381
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:20,306
Please don't.

382
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,012
Computron wants to live.

383
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:25,783
Shut... Shut up. Shut up.

384
00:20:32,163 --> 00:20:34,631
Sittin' in my office
With a plate of grilled bacon

385
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:36,963
Call my man Dwight
Just to see what was shakin'!

386
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:39,502
Yo, Mike,
our town is dope and pretty

387
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,764
So check out how we live

388
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:43,272
In the Electric City!

389
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:44,672
They call it Scranton!
What?

390
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:47,267
The Electric City! Scranton! What?

391
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:48,642
The Electric City!

392
00:20:48,713 --> 00:20:50,977
Lazy Scranton,
the Electric City

393
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:53,608
They call it that
'cause of the electricity

394
00:20:53,684 --> 00:20:56,118
The city's laid
out from east to west

395
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:58,553
And our public parks and
libraries are truly the best!

396
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:01,353
Call Poison Control
if you're bit by a spider!

397
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:04,451
But check that it's covered
By your healthcare provider!

398
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:06,826
Plenty of space
in the parkin' lot!

399
00:21:06,964 --> 00:21:09,558
But the little cars
go in the compact spot!

400
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:12,467
Spot! Spot! Spot!

401
00:21:12,536 --> 00:21:13,594
Snack attack time

402
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:14,831
Don't lose your head

403
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:18,500
We like Cuginos
for the tasty bread!

404
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:20,009
They call it Scranton!
What?

405
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:22,443
The Electric City! Scranton! What?

406
00:21:22,513 --> 00:21:24,981
The Electric City! Scranton! What?

407
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:27,517
The Electric City! Scranton! What?

408
00:21:27,585 --> 00:21:30,554
The Electric City! Scranton! What?
