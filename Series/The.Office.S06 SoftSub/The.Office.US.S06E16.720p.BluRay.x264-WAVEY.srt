1
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:04,868
Vancouver Court
Hotel, how may I help you?

2
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:07,030
Hello, Vancouver,
this is Michael Scott

3
00:00:07,106 --> 00:00:09,540
calling from
the United States of America.

4
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:11,701
I have a reservation
in your fair city

5
00:00:11,777 --> 00:00:14,245
from February 12th
to the 19th.

6
00:00:14,446 --> 00:00:15,845
First week of the Olympics.

7
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:17,279
Well, we're looking forward
to having you,

8
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:18,941
so let me just pull up
your information here.

9
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:20,042
Oki-doke.

10
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:21,814
Uh, I don't seem
to have it, sir.

11
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:23,245
What?

12
00:00:23,322 --> 00:00:24,653
I'm not seeing anything
under confirmation...

13
00:00:24,723 --> 00:00:26,782
No. No. Could it be under "affirmation?"

14
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:27,883
'Cause you have
thousands of those.

15
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,791
We're just trying to
look it up right now.

16
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:32,023
You did get the
e-vite to my barbeque.

17
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:33,530
Come on, Dwight.
Michael.

18
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:36,625
Sir, a lot of people are
trying to get last-minute reservations

19
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:38,226
at hotels here
for the Olympics,

20
00:00:38,303 --> 00:00:39,793
but we've been
fully booked for months.

21
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:43,672
Well, I have been booked for three
years, so you should have that.

22
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:46,233
I have always heard that British
Columbia is a very nice place,

23
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:48,939
but I'm not getting that
from this conversation.

24
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:53,314
Wait, I got it! Confirmation
code, X-V-2-R-D-M.

25
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:55,644
Oh.

26
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:57,188
Here it is. Yeah.
Oh.

27
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:58,314
Uh-huh.
Thank you.

28
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,688
Seven nights in our
street-view economy single.

29
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:01,919
That's it.
Yeah.

30
00:01:01,994 --> 00:01:05,088
We changed systems a
while back. I do apologize.

31
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:06,323
Okay.
Okay.

32
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:07,797
How may I
help you, Mr. Scott?

33
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:11,199
All right. I would like to
cancel my reservation, please.

34
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,135
There is a cancellation fee
for this, sir.

35
00:01:13,205 --> 00:01:15,298
Okay, put it on my card.

36
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:38,489
Today, Jo Bennett,
the CEO from Sabre

37
00:01:38,564 --> 00:01:41,260
is coming to see us
here for the first time.

38
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:45,133
She bought us sight unseen,
like a mail-order bride,

39
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:48,432
so she's gotta be kind
of nervous. I mean, are we ugly?

40
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:51,340
Are we smart? Are we cool?
Are we too cool?

41
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:53,406
Do we speak English?

42
00:01:58,317 --> 00:02:00,308
Why, hello!

43
00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:01,579
This is
Michael Scott,

44
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:03,211
co-regional manager
of this branch.

45
00:02:03,288 --> 00:02:04,482
Pleasure to meet you,
Miss Bennett.

46
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:06,148
Uh, that's Mrs. Bennett,
sweetheart.

47
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:08,523
My husband and I are divorced
but I kept the "missus"

48
00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:10,858
just to piss off the new wife. Oh.

49
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:12,988
Well, let's
take a gander around this place.

50
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:14,657
These sure are
pretty dogs.

51
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,496
They love a good crotch.

52
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:18,030
They sure do.

53
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:19,593
You should take that
as a compliment.

54
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:21,070
Oh, I do.

55
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:25,165
Hello.
Hello.

56
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:28,036
Do you always stay seated
when a lady enters the room?

57
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:29,444
I am treating you
the same as a man,

58
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:31,244
for whom I would
also not stand.

59
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:34,217
Unless it was the
president, or Judge Judy.

60
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:36,781
I like that.

61
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:38,686
- This is Accounting.
- Uh-huh.

62
00:02:38,757 --> 00:02:39,781
Hi.

63
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:40,950
Good-looking group.

64
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:43,392
Over here is Meredith
Palmer, Creed Bratton.

65
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:45,020
Another couple
of heartbreakers.

66
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:46,587
Who's this tall
drink of sun tea?

67
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:50,157
That is Jim Halpert. He is the
co-regional manager of this office.

68
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:51,759
I thought this guy
was the manager.

69
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:54,738
Oh, he is. He's the co-manager.
That's the other co-manager.

70
00:02:54,806 --> 00:02:56,398
Two guys doing one job?

71
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,472
We gotta do something
about that.

72
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:03,872
I've got some
Valentine's cards

73
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:06,713
for my co-workers
and my bro-workers.

74
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:08,252
No. No.

75
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,514
What? No candy?

76
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:11,617
Valentine's Day.
Right around the corner.

77
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,557
Erin and I have been
on zero dates.

78
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:16,457
So I got her a
Valentine's Day card,

79
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:18,655
but I didn't want
to seem too eager,

80
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,721
so I got cards for
everyone in the whole office

81
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:22,767
to kind of dilute
it a little bit.

82
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:24,927
Look alive.

83
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:27,164
Jeez, you gave me
a paper cut on my throat.

84
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:29,271
Yeah, I have this thing
about men cutting

85
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:31,275
or threatening
to cut my throat.

86
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:33,208
Don't try to
cut my throat.

87
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:36,770
Jo, I don't know how things work in
Florida, which from your description

88
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:39,908
sounds like a colorful,
lawless swamp,

89
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:43,952
but here it takes
two men to do one job,

90
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:46,050
where in Florida,
it might take

91
00:03:46,124 --> 00:03:48,285
one very strong
woman to do such a job.

92
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,725
Whoa. Whoa.

93
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:53,260
I'll take over. Um,
what we're doing here,

94
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:55,664
Michael handles more of
the big picture stuff,

95
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:58,134
and I handle more of
the day-to-day stuff.

96
00:03:58,203 --> 00:03:59,500
Yeah.
- So, together...

97
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:01,266
I think I understand.
All right.

98
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,331
Each of you is
doing half a job.

99
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:05,000
No. And sometimes
I can hardly handle that.

100
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:09,179
Now this is knucklehead talk. I'm
not going to abide it, you know.

101
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:12,706
You can't give me gravy and tell me
it's jelly, 'cause gravy ain't sweet.

102
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:14,479
Is it, Jim? I don't think so.

103
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:15,645
Michael?

104
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:16,779
Forget the question.

105
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:19,254
I think one of you
should return to Sales,

106
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:21,349
and the other one
will be a manager.

107
00:04:21,426 --> 00:04:24,452
I humbly accept
the management position.

108
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:25,621
Why would you just
automatically get it?

109
00:04:25,697 --> 00:04:29,690
Because, well, Jim, where I'm
from, there are two types of folk,

110
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:33,568
those who ain't and those who
are knee-high on a grasshopper.

111
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:37,473
Which type ain't you ain't?
Y'all come back now.

112
00:04:39,344 --> 00:04:41,244
Do you even know what that means? Yes.

113
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:43,474
Well, I'm gonna let this
marinate. So you can go.

114
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:44,606
Um...

115
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:46,446
You can go on.
Yeah.

116
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:52,289
I'm Jolene Bennett, Jo for short.
I'm a breast cancer survivor,

117
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:54,484
close personal friends
with Nancy Pelosi,

118
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:57,187
and Truman Capote and I slept
with three of the same guys.

119
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:59,889
When I was a little girl,
I was terrified to fly,

120
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:01,933
and now I have my
own pilot's license.

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,934
I am CEO of
Sabre International

122
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:07,699
and I sell the best damn printers and
all-in-one machines Korea can make.

123
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:08,797
Pleased to meet you.

124
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,167
Traffic jam.

125
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:12,210
Uh-oh. Traffic jam
on route three.

126
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:15,272
Twenty people
dead in a pileup.

127
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:17,338
There's blood everywhere.

128
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:20,183
Um, I got you
a Valentine's card.

129
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:21,776
You did?
Yeah.

130
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:24,678
A bird and a dog!

131
00:05:24,756 --> 00:05:26,519
Yeah, well, it's Snoopy and Woodstock.

132
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:27,649
You named them?

133
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:29,125
Uh, Charles Schulz did.

134
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:30,917
I thought it was relevant

135
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:33,089
'cause I got you all those
birds for Christmas, remember?

136
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:36,862
Yeah, I do remember.
Oh, they love each other.

137
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:39,335
Oh, look at that. They
sure do. I hadn't noticed.

138
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:41,667
Oh, it smells
really good, too.

139
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,105
Yeah, it's
Roger Federer for Men.

140
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:44,665
I sprayed
some in there.

141
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:47,610
Andy, whoa!
Thank you very much.

142
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:49,476
It's got pheromones
in it.

143
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:51,113
- Hey.
- Hi.

144
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,080
Just choosing seats, not getting
married. Chop, chop, little onion.

145
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:58,085
Jo, there's books
in my chair.

146
00:05:58,156 --> 00:05:59,521
That's right, darling.

147
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:02,822
Now you're the proud new
owner of a Sabre handbook,

148
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:04,725
and my autobiography.

149
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,231
Now, you all must be in a tizzy.
I can see it on your faces.

150
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,565
I mean, what's going on now? I
mean, who owns Dunder Mifflin?

151
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:14,469
Right? I mean, Sabre?
What's that?

152
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:18,932
Some company we never heard
of from down in Tallahassee?

153
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,638
I mean, where is that?
Near Mars?

154
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:23,510
No, we know. Texas.

155
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:26,440
Now, Dunder Mifflin
has an arm's reach

156
00:06:26,518 --> 00:06:29,112
into all these small businesses
all over the northeast,

157
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:31,687
and now we're gonna
take that arm

158
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:36,391
and we're going to
start selling printers.

159
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:37,894
I could manage my
way around that.

160
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:39,794
They're the easiest-to-use
printers in the market.

161
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:42,356
I will try to
manage my excitement.

162
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:46,465
I have been saying
the word "manager" a lot,

163
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:49,632
so whenever Jo thinks
manager, she thinks of me.

164
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:53,211
Camel cigarettes did the
same thing with Joe Camel

165
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:55,178
by making him
look like a penis.

166
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:58,011
I can't even go
near a cigarette now

167
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,574
without thinking of
a penis, and vice versa.

168
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:03,346
I think that's it.
So we're all good.

169
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,219
Okay.
Thanks, y'all.

170
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:14,763
Oh, my God.

171
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,963
I guess Andy likes me. I never
thought of him in that way.

172
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:20,968
But I guess in most
romantic comedies,

173
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,529
the guy you're supposed
to be with is the one

174
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:24,302
that you never
thought of in that way.

175
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:28,176
You might have even thought he was
annoying or possibly homosexual.

176
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:29,846
So check this out.

177
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:32,349
According to the handbook,
you could make more money

178
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:34,009
as a salesman
than as a manager.

179
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:36,144
They have all these
incentive programs.

180
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:37,779
I ran your numbers
from last year.

181
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:39,687
This is way more
than I make now.

182
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:41,919
I don't think I'm gonna
miss being manager.

183
00:07:41,993 --> 00:07:43,790
You know how some people say
they're not in it for the money?

184
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:45,727
Well, with all due
respect to this job,

185
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:47,958
I think I'm definitely
in it for the money.

186
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:49,898
And, quite honestly,
the women.

187
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:52,301
Hey. Got a second?

188
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,462
Sure.
All right.

189
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:56,336
You here to tell me that you
think I would be a better manager,

190
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:58,933
and that you are sorry
for being such a jerk?

191
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,534
Actually, yeah.

192
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:03,544
What?
Exactly that.

193
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:08,018
I think that you absolutely deserve
the manager position more than I do.

194
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,588
What? Really?
Yeah.

195
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,224
Wow! Wow!

196
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:17,791
Hello, Oscar.

197
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:19,057
Michael, reading.

198
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,154
What are you reading?

199
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:21,256
The Atlantic.

200
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,528
Oh, that is my favorite
ocean. I love it.

201
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:27,663
I'm so happy right now. No, I
can't keep it a secret any longer.

202
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:29,270
Jim's stepping
down to salesman.

203
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,605
I am going to be the
sole manager once again.

204
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:33,644
I should step
into Sales myself.

205
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:36,078
Why? Is there an
untapped gay market?

206
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:38,743
Sabre has no caps
on commissions.

207
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:40,944
He can make a lot
more money in Sales.

208
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,720
Where did you get
that information?

209
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:50,192
Manual.
Manuel who?

210
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:53,797
Mmm-hmm. Well, according to the manual,

211
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:56,095
there is no cap
on commissions.

212
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,930
I have been hustled.

213
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:01,469
Son of a bitch.

214
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,405
This is...
Pardon me.

215
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:05,170
Speak of the devil. We
were just talking about you.

216
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:06,676
Have a seat.
Okay.

217
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:09,805
Now, Jim here is thinking
about taking himself

218
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:11,542
out of the running
for being manager. Yep.

219
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:15,677
Oh, really?
That is so sweet of you!

220
00:09:16,454 --> 00:09:20,322
But I cannot accept, because
I have been thinking about it,

221
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:22,783
and I think I want
to go back to Sales.

222
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,089
Really?
- Really?

223
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:25,993
Yeah, you can take the man
out of the salesman,

224
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:28,259
but you can't take
the sales out of salesman.

225
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,028
Well, I think you're both
being a little too modest.

226
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:33,867
No, I really, really think
Michael is better at being manager

227
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:35,429
for so many reasons.
Mmm-mmm.

228
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:40,638
No. I think I would be bad.
I would sleep in my office...

229
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:42,737
Okay... And I would
sexually harass people.

230
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:44,714
Why would you do that? I'm
turning myself in right now.

231
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:47,980
You know, Michael, you have more
experience in sales and management,

232
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:49,748
so I'm going to defer
to your judgment.

233
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:50,845
Thank you.

234
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:53,413
I think you will
become the salesman,

235
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:55,686
and congratulations,

236
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,285
you're gonna be the new
manager of this branch.

237
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:01,027
That's great.
Congratulations.

238
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,300
Have fun signing my
commission checks, boss.

239
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,907
Michael marked his heights.
He's grown.

240
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:22,515
Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen,
he's been promoted to sole manager.

241
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:27,255
We have got to step this up. Meet
me behind the dumpster in 90 seconds.

242
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:29,456
Eighty-nine, 88...

243
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:31,695
You're 20 minutes late.

244
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:35,198
Um, I was
at another dumpster.

245
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,767
Just admit you lost
track of time.

246
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:41,733
Ryan and I have been meeting up
to work on our diabolical plot against Jim.

247
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:44,400
Ryan is always late
for our meetings.

248
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,773
I wish I had a lair.

249
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:49,079
Did you see Saw?

250
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:51,707
Of course I seesaw. Mose
and I seesaw all the time.

251
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:54,581
No, the movie. Did
you see the movie Saw?

252
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:58,650
Oh. Yeah. Great film. Almost
as fun as going on a seesaw.

253
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:01,624
Okay. The reason these movies
are so popular... Mmm-hmm.

254
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:04,456
...is the element of
psychological torment.

255
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:07,756
I like where you're
going with this. Continue.

256
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:10,935
Could we lure him into an
old warehouse or something?

257
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:12,731
I have an old barn.
It's kind of smelly. Yes.

258
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:14,635
But that might be a
plus. And then what? Okay.

259
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:16,799
We do what they
did in Saw.

260
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:22,769
I mean, we don't
kill him, obviously.

261
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:23,836
I have a mask.

262
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:24,973
Okay, that's your idea?

263
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,881
Exactly like in the movie?

264
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:29,784
That is the most idiotic thing
I have ever heard in my life.

265
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:31,344
Well, suggest something
else then. Don't just...

266
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:32,720
Are you supposed
to cut his leg off?

267
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,053
Don't just criticize my idea! Think!

268
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,252
You think of
something then.

269
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:41,224
Michael, I'm worried that not all your
toys are gonna fit on your new desk.

270
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:42,561
How is that possible?

271
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:45,296
Well, in your old office, there were
all those ledges and extra space.

272
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,203
No excuses, Erin, come on.
Make it happen.

273
00:11:48,873 --> 00:11:50,773
You know, I actually think
that I should get back to work.

274
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:53,936
Jim asked me to do some
stuff, and he's manager.

275
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:57,347
Oh, yeah, fine, fine.
Leave it here.

276
00:11:57,415 --> 00:11:58,507
Okay. All right.

277
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,346
I have to make
some sales anyway.

278
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:03,410
Who should I call with
my magic sales fingers?

279
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,727
Michael Scott,
Head of Sales.

280
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:14,231
You gotta do something, man.
You can't just sit there.

281
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:21,397
The new IT guy. Nick.

282
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:22,531
Nick.

283
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:25,576
I think he's the key. He's very
trusting. He's looking for friends.

284
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:27,838
He's been given an
awesome amount of power,

285
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:29,675
and does not know
how to wield it.

286
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,010
Like Frodo.

287
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:36,020
Why don't you just let me handle the
Tolkien references, okay, dumb jock?

288
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:39,447
Well, I think he can be
corrupted. Like Gollum.

289
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:43,820
Smeagol was corrupted
and became Gollum.

290
00:12:44,362 --> 00:12:47,126
I might start a diabolical
plot against him after this one.

291
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:50,129
Who's hungry?

292
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:51,259
What is that?

293
00:12:51,336 --> 00:12:53,827
It's ants on a log. Michael would
always have me bring them in at 2:30

294
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:55,805
and say, "Who's hungry?"

295
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:58,206
Oh. I'm fine.
Thank you, though.

296
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,641
Do you want me to spin you in
your chair and make you dizzy?

297
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:01,906
Why would I
want to do that?

298
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,744
It's a thinking technique.
All the top executives do it.

299
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:08,115
It keeps the brain moving, and a
spinning brain's a working brain.

300
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:11,178
For now I'm just gonna
go back to work here.

301
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:12,621
Oh, sure.
Yeah, thank you.

302
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,884
Well...

303
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:19,452
It will be a pleasure doing
business with you. Thanks. Bye, bye.

304
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:26,632
I just got a new account. The
gentlemen's club in Carbondale.

305
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:30,572
It is called Curves. I
went by there the other day,

306
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:34,135
saw some of the women walking
in. Not really my cup of tea.

307
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:36,305
Actually, Kevin,
you might like it.

308
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:37,439
Nice.

309
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:41,683
You know, we really don't announce
out loud our sales that much.

310
00:13:41,753 --> 00:13:43,880
Why not? It's part of
the sales experience.

311
00:13:43,955 --> 00:13:46,185
It's not really
1992 anymore.

312
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:47,349
Okay.

313
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:52,255
"You brighten my day with
the sound of your voice.

314
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,527
"You bring so much laughter and
love. You're everything to me,

315
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,034
"and I was so blessed when
God sent you here to me."

316
00:13:58,102 --> 00:13:59,194
Jeez Louise.

317
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,794
I know.
Obsessed with me much?

318
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:01,930
Well, everyone got one.

319
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:03,735
What did yours say?

320
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:06,973
"Friends are worth sharing
a dog house with."

321
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:10,606
It's no wonder that Andy gave
Kelly such a romantic card.

322
00:14:10,715 --> 00:14:12,410
I can't
compete with her.

323
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:16,715
That girl can sing and dance and
gets all of her clothes at the mall.

324
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:20,847
And I feel like such a fool for thinking
that Andy was only going after one girl,

325
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:24,892
because Andy Bernard is a
playboy. And why shouldn't he be?

326
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,222
He's got it all.

327
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:32,570
There he is.
The IT guy.

328
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:35,271
I see you discovered
the break room.

329
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,364
Yep.

330
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:38,773
I imagine one of the best
things about being an IT guy is,

331
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:41,107
you get to know everyone's
computer passwords.

332
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:42,976
No, I actually don't.

333
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:46,545
Listen, I know you
have to say that,

334
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:48,313
but we got
a little problem here.

335
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:50,820
There is an employee
named Jim Halpert,

336
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,652
and he's doing some
terrible things. Okay?

337
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:56,683
He's molesting people via the
Internet, and we need to stop him.

338
00:14:57,662 --> 00:14:59,254
I think that you
should call the cops.

339
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,628
No, the cops called us.

340
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:07,368
So I'm gonna need you to give me the
password to Jim Halpert's computer.

341
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:09,005
I don't know what to
tell you, man. I'm sorry.

342
00:15:09,073 --> 00:15:10,631
I just can't give out
his password like that.

343
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:15,441
Nick, we can make things
very difficult for you.

344
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:20,042
Are you threatening me?

345
00:15:20,118 --> 00:15:21,176
Threatening you?

346
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:24,312
No.

347
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,128
What is that smell?
Do you smell that?

348
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,436
What is that? Like a
sulfur deposit under here?

349
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:44,304
Michael, stop.

350
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,240
No, I'm serious.
We don't have to put up...

351
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:49,403
Is it the dogs?
Michael.

352
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:51,845
You know what? We don't
have to deal with this.

353
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,146
I am going to
Google sulfur maps.

354
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:55,549
Michael, it's Phyllis.

355
00:15:57,889 --> 00:15:59,379
No, this is geological.

356
00:15:59,457 --> 00:16:02,255
I sent an email out to
everyone in this area

357
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:04,318
that this might be
a side effect

358
00:16:04,395 --> 00:16:06,659
to my new allergy
medication I'm on.

359
00:16:06,731 --> 00:16:08,699
Are you kidding me?
No.

360
00:16:12,036 --> 00:16:13,469
And you guys are
okay with this?

361
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:15,062
She sent an email.

362
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:16,299
I did.

363
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:35,682
It's not 'cause
of the smell.

364
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,024
I'm just expecting
a nose bleed.

365
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:41,623
Oh, my God.

366
00:16:45,903 --> 00:16:47,200
You scared me.

367
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:48,829
I'm sorry.
I thought you saw me.

368
00:16:48,906 --> 00:16:51,966
I didn't see you. And
you were there all along.

369
00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:57,372
Well, warmed it up for you,
so it should be good to go.

370
00:16:57,849 --> 00:16:59,840
Cool. Thanks.
Bye, Andy.

371
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,114
That was weird.

372
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:10,524
No, it ain't. We all saw
the valentine you gave her.

373
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:12,289
I don't even know
what that card said.

374
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:14,888
Believe me,
if I got that card,

375
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:18,367
we'd be in the bathroom
doing it right now.

376
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:25,334
Hey.

377
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:27,069
Hey.

378
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:30,779
You know, it's funny. I used to stand
in here and wish I was out there.

379
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:32,577
Now I'm out there,
and I wish I was in here.

380
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,083
Well, the grass
is always greener.

381
00:17:34,152 --> 00:17:36,882
Yeah, except there's
no grass out there.

382
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:39,680
It's just a farty dirt-patch.

383
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:40,883
Well, it's what
you wanted.

384
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:44,655
I really need my job back. We
made a terrible mistake here.

385
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:47,526
For the record, I
fought this. All right?

386
00:17:47,598 --> 00:17:50,032
And now, I'm not
really sure what we do.

387
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:53,562
We make a poster that says,
"Happy Opposite Day"

388
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:56,300
and she sees it on the
way out. That's stupid.

389
00:17:56,374 --> 00:18:00,834
Oh, I wish we had one of those
amnesia flashlights from Men In Black.

390
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:04,876
Hey. What was that movie where
their boss was within earshot

391
00:18:04,949 --> 00:18:07,383
and they could have just
gone and talked to her?

392
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:08,942
Lethal Weapon?
That's it.

393
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,578
I think we should do it
the Lethal Weapon way.

394
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:13,891
You two are grown-assed men.
What do I have to do?

395
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,357
Fire you and get
two people in here

396
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:16,552
who don't need so
much management?

397
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:17,651
Ah!

398
00:18:17,728 --> 00:18:19,457
What I... Michael's
saying that he's better

399
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,656
at being a manager,
and I agree.

400
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:22,961
I'm just... He's a better
people person, weirdly.

401
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:25,502
And weirdly, I'm a good
dog person, right, guys?

402
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,538
Come on. See?
They love me.

403
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:30,472
Fine. I don't care which
one of you does which job,

404
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,408
just stop meeting with me
to talk about it.

405
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:35,874
All right.
All right.

406
00:18:35,947 --> 00:18:37,312
Oh.

407
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:41,875
I gotta take this. Yeah.
Finish walking my dogs for me.

408
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:45,722
And don't ride them. A lot
of people try to ride them.

409
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:52,092
Excuse me, everyone,
please check your emails.

410
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:54,358
I just sent you
the following message,

411
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:57,367
"Coworkers, you may have
received a valentine from me.

412
00:18:57,435 --> 00:19:00,302
"Please understand this does not
mean that I like you in any way."

413
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:02,805
You don't even
like us as friends?

414
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:06,168
Phyllis, you guys are,
like, my closest friends.

415
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:08,538
I just mean I don't
like-like you.

416
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:09,671
What are we, five?

417
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:11,374
"Please don't read
into this card.

418
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:14,077
"Yours in professionalism,
Nard Dog."

419
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,578
Um, why did I just receive
a mass email from you

420
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:18,121
that said that
you don't like me?

421
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:20,714
Do you realize how hard
that makes me like you, Andy?

422
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,191
It's not... That wasn't...

423
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:27,160
I like someone else.

424
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:28,289
Who?

425
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:32,468
It's not...

426
00:19:34,238 --> 00:19:35,865
Whether or not...

427
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:40,335
Who? What?

428
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:43,403
Yeah, I guess Andy
never liked Kelly.

429
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:45,174
How about that?

430
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:49,609
It smells good in here.

431
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:54,124
It sure does. Okay, we have your
space heater, your humidifier,

432
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:57,821
your dehumidifier, your fan, your
foot fan and your food dehydrator.

433
00:19:57,895 --> 00:20:00,420
Erin, what about
my keyboard?

434
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,027
Ah.

435
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:08,033
So good to be home.

436
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:11,634
How about a little
Bossa Nova?

437
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:25,817
He looks happy.

438
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:27,983
Yep.

439
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:32,692
Well, well, well.
Hmm. Boss for...

440
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:34,287
What was it? Oh.

441
00:20:34,398 --> 00:20:38,630
Four-and-a-half hours.
New record. Low.

442
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,736
Previous record,
Henry Rostin.

443
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:43,535
Boss for nine years,
four months.

444
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:46,076
And he only left because he
had family matters to attend to,

445
00:20:46,143 --> 00:20:47,701
and he... What?

446
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:54,779
Michael!

447
00:20:57,788 --> 00:21:00,621
I can't help but think that
something we did made this possible.

448
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:05,151
Jim dug his own grave, but
maybe we provided the shovel.

449
00:21:05,463 --> 00:21:09,763
Temp, I like that. I'm
gonna engrave that into a piece of wood.

450
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:11,568
Care to celebrate
with a drink?

451
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:13,035
I would love to.

452
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:17,865
Why not?

453
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:19,773
Because martini bars
are pretentious.

454
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:21,334
No, thank you. I'm
sorry that I don't want

455
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:22,879
farm-boy swill
like you do, you know?

456
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:24,847
It is not farm-boy swill.
I will show you.

457
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:26,974
It is beet vodka
and it is delicious.

458
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:29,713
I'm not interested in
anything I have to make myself.
