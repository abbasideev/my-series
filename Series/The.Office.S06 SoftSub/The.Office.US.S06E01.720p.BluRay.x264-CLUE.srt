1
00:00:07,606 --> 00:00:08,766
Parkour!

2
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:12,341
Michael.
Parkour! Parkour!

3
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:14,839
Extreme.
- Parkour!

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,414
This is parkour.
Internet sensation of 2004,

5
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:22,086
and it was in one of the Bond
films. It's pretty impressive.

6
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:25,715
The goal is to get from point A to
point B as creatively as possible.

7
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,520
So technically
they are doing parkour,

8
00:00:27,593 --> 00:00:31,051
as long as point A is delusion
and point B is the hospital.

9
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:35,090
Parkour!

10
00:00:39,838 --> 00:00:41,533
Yeah, parkour!

11
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:43,274
Andy, leap frog.
Go, go!

12
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:45,536
Do me! Do me!
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

13
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:46,635
Parkour! Parkour!

14
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:48,646
Get off! Get off!
Okay.

15
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:49,703
Parkour!

16
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:53,775
Parkour! Jump over the camera.

17
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:55,314
Jump over
the camera.

18
00:00:57,222 --> 00:00:59,520
Okay, we all go together,
or we go one at a time.

19
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:04,221
Here it is. Here it is. Truck
to refrigerators to dumpster,

20
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,888
360 spin onto the palettes, back
flip, gainer into the trashcan.

21
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:09,900
Yeah, gainer!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

22
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:12,402
Parkour, parkour!
Parkour, parkour!

23
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:13,733
I'm right behind you,
Andy. Come on!

24
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:16,036
Let's do it!
Yeah!

25
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:20,704
Parkour.

26
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,459
Good.

27
00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:48,795
Excellent.

28
00:01:50,342 --> 00:01:51,400
Thank you.

29
00:01:51,977 --> 00:01:54,172
Here you go. Is there
anything else I can do?

30
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,782
Yes.

31
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,649
See those files behind
Kevin's desk? Mmm-hmm.

32
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:08,716
Go put them all
in random order.

33
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:09,783
Okay.

34
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:13,228
Then come back here for your
next assignment concerning their order.

35
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:17,434
This is the last day of our
summer interns. It's been nice.

36
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:18,800
We haven't had
interns in a while.

37
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:22,338
Ever since Michael's
Monica Lewinsky incident.

38
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:23,839
He didn't do
anything sexual.

39
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:26,875
He just made far, far too
many Monica Lewinsky jokes.

40
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:30,240
It was just easier for corporate
to shut down the program.

41
00:02:33,218 --> 00:02:35,345
Think she did him? I bet
there's something there.

42
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:36,921
I was with them in
the kitchen yesterday,

43
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,116
and they were all too happy
to be cleaning the freezer.

44
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:41,590
If they get married before I
do, I'm going to kill myself.

45
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,857
Who's getting married?
Nobody.

46
00:02:44,963 --> 00:02:46,521
If somebody doesn't tell me,
I'm gonna start screaming.

47
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:48,361
It's Eric and Megan.
Oh!

48
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:49,957
Hey, I hired them.

49
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:51,430
Matchmaker.

50
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:53,799
This place is like
Spaniard fly.

51
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:56,033
They're not getting married.
It's just talk.

52
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:57,700
Did everybody know
about this but me?

53
00:02:57,776 --> 00:02:59,744
There's nothing to know.
It's just gossip.

54
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:03,242
Okay. Okay.

55
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:05,941
We haven't told anyone
that I'm pregnant.

56
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:09,283
What with her being unmarried,
knocked up by some guy.

57
00:03:09,354 --> 00:03:11,788
The yakety-yaks in this office
would have a field day.

58
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,619
Yeah, and we don't want
them at the wedding thinking

59
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:16,717
Jim's being marched down the
aisle by my dad with a shotgun.

60
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:19,325
Wait, there's not going
to be a shotgun?

61
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:20,422
Nope.

62
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:23,161
No shotgun? Because
that changes everything.

63
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:24,699
Can't back out
now, Halpert.

64
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:28,530
What are you going to do about
it? There's no shotgun, so,

65
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:32,135
free at last,
free at last.

66
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:34,437
No, keep it up.

67
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:37,070
You'll never guess
what I know.

68
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:39,083
Okay. Let me finish
this thought.

69
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:41,018
Eric likes Megan.

70
00:03:42,287 --> 00:03:43,549
He most definitely does.

71
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:45,713
He's been asking her out
repeatedly for weeks.

72
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,726
She finally said yes. They went
out on a group date the other night.

73
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:50,159
Apparently
it went very well.

74
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:53,154
How do you know this?
People tell me things.

75
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,200
I guess I have
a face you can trust.

76
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:57,258
I think it's because
of my low cheek bones.

77
00:03:58,136 --> 00:04:01,833
And boom. Okay, what is it?
What can't I guess?

78
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:05,502
I hate, hate, hate
being left out.

79
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:10,305
Whether it's not being picked for
a team or being picked for a team

80
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:13,545
and then showing up and realizing
that the team doesn't exist,

81
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:16,487
or that the sport
doesn't exist.

82
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:19,313
I should have known.
Poopball?

83
00:04:20,592 --> 00:04:23,493
Oh, man, I know how
you feel. Third wheel.

84
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:26,759
I have been the third wheel
so many times in my life.

85
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:29,593
My mom told me something once
that made me feel a lot better.

86
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:33,764
She said, "The third wheel
is what makes it a tricycle."

87
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:35,130
What are you
talking about?

88
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:37,471
I am talking about your group
date with Megan and Eric.

89
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:38,770
At Tinks?
Yes.

90
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,275
How'd you know about that? Well...

91
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:41,573
Did Stanley tell you?

92
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,681
Stanley was on your
group date?

93
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:46,814
No. Stanley
was with his wife.

94
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:48,443
I waved at him
but he didn't wave back.

95
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:52,523
Does anybody else
know about this?

96
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:53,649
No.

97
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:59,228
There he goes.
There he goes.

98
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:03,993
So, what is the scuttlebutt?
Anybody hear anything?

99
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:08,901
Nothing? I got a little
something-something.

100
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:10,805
I don't know
if I should say.

101
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,237
So just keep it
to yourself, then.

102
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,506
Stanley is having
a midlife crisis.

103
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:16,774
Stanley is way past
the middle of his life,

104
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:18,577
especially considering
his height-to-weight ratio.

105
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,210
Well, apparently,
he and his wife

106
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:23,914
were out dancing at a
club for young people.

107
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:25,581
Teri's out of town,
Michael.

108
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,850
Who?
Stanley's wife, Teri.

109
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:30,759
She's at an interior
decorating expo in Philly.

110
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:35,729
And Stanley hates crowds, kids and music.
I think you should check your facts.

111
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,340
You stupid son of a bitch.
You set me up.

112
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:47,500
What are you
talking about?

113
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,206
Stanley's wife
is out of town.

114
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:50,270
He was with somebody.

115
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,407
He was definitely
with someone.

116
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:54,007
Oh! Was he? Well, who? His sister?

117
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:56,513
I don't get it!

118
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:59,819
If that was his sister, then what
they were doing was totally illegal.

119
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:02,015
Drugs?

120
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:04,622
Making out.

121
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,700
Okay.

122
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,899
Okay.
No, it's okay.

123
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:20,004
Never mind.
Carry on.

124
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,140
Stanley
is having an affair.

125
00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:23,507
What?
I know.

126
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:28,517
I am very happy right now, thrilled
perhaps, to be a part of the office,

127
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:30,248
to be a part of
the conversation.

128
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:33,951
When you have somebody's attention,
and their eyes are lighting up

129
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:36,789
because they are very interested
in what you have to say,

130
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:38,022
that is a great feeling.

131
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:40,462
And I experienced that
firsthand today.

132
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:43,660
It is wonderful to be
the center of attention.

133
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:46,067
That and that
are the same letter.

134
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:47,799
Q.

135
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:49,670
No. No.

136
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:51,470
Okay.
He's holding a pencil.

137
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,044
He could be doing a crossword
puzzle with that pencil.

138
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:57,774
What's that letter, right
there? Same letter here and here.

139
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:59,578
What haven't you guessed?
T.

140
00:06:59,818 --> 00:07:04,551
T! Yes! Yes!
That is a T.

141
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:09,559
And there's another one right there.
Just sound that out. You're almost there.

142
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:13,727
Hey, Stanley, where are you
going, big guy? Up to no good?

143
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:15,857
I'm meeting a client. Do
you have a problem with that?

144
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:19,131
No, no, no, no, no. I just
had a quick question for you.

145
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:24,005
I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for
a woman who can dance, beautiful woman.

146
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:25,201
Do you know anybody?

147
00:07:25,644 --> 00:07:26,668
Goodbye.

148
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:29,737
Pays 5 million dollars.
Nudity required.

149
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:31,340
You have to stop this.

150
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,407
Did you hear that
Stanley's having an affair?

151
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:36,079
I did. From you.
You got to stop telling people.

152
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:39,783
Okay. I get it. You feel out of the
loop and you feel sorry for yourself,

153
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,019
and it's really sad because
everybody thinks you're a loser.

154
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:44,254
Do you even know if it's
true? Do you have any idea?

155
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:46,923
Because you might be
ruining his life.

156
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:55,867
Hold up! Hold up! Hold up!
No, no, no, no!

157
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:59,169
It's time to stop being
polite and get real!

158
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:01,536
Stanley,
you having an affair?

159
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:06,645
That is ridiculous. Of course
not. Why would you think that?

160
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:08,913
So it's not true.
Okay. Well...

161
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:11,617
Oh!

162
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,353
Those interns, they told me
they saw you at the club,

163
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:17,254
and they all said
it was you.

164
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:23,029
It was clearly just racial
profiling gossip. The little...

165
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:26,229
Damn! I told her
it was a stupid idea...

166
00:08:26,304 --> 00:08:28,295
It's so stupid.
...to go up in that club.

167
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:32,070
It's just that Teri's been
traveling a lot lately.

168
00:08:32,143 --> 00:08:34,634
I know. I know.
It's been lonely.

169
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:36,203
Oh, I bet. I...

170
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:38,441
Cynthia's been
keeping me company.

171
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:42,111
She was my nurse when
I was in rehabilitation.

172
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:45,723
We used to go on these
long walks on the treadmill.

173
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:49,292
I didn't intend...

174
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:51,693
Wait, wait, wait.

175
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:54,089
So it is true?

176
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:55,928
Yeah, but Michael, I'm
going to go break it off.

177
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,195
That's where I'm headed
right now. I swear.

178
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:58,998
Oh, my God.
Wait a second.

179
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,234
Do people often say they're going on
sales calls and then go someplace else?

180
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:04,332
Because that's not cool.

181
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:09,073
I just need you to promise not to
say a word about this to anyone.

182
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:10,537
Michael, please.

183
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:12,412
I'm not saying
a damn thing.

184
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:13,849
I'm counting
on you, Michael.

185
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,409
Okay.
You can count on me.

186
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:21,183
Oh, that smells good.

187
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:24,624
Yeah, I might have extra. It
just depends on how many I eat.

188
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:26,755
Did you hear about Angela?
That's pretty weird.

189
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:30,267
Yeah. What do you
mean exactly?

190
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:35,472
Well, the fact that she apparently
is dating an 81-year-old billionaire.

191
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,535
Owns a Quiznos
on the turnpike.

192
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:39,733
Really?
Uh-huh.

193
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:41,908
Right?

194
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,279
How do you un-tell
something? You can't.

195
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:48,312
You can't put words
back in your mouth.

196
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:53,085
What you can do is
spread false gossip,

197
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,788
so that people think that everything
that's been said is untrue,

198
00:09:57,062 --> 00:09:59,462
including "Stanley
is having an affair."

199
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:04,896
It's like the end of Spartacus. I've
seen that movie half a dozen times,

200
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,704
and I still don't know
who the real Spartacus is.

201
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:11,770
And that is what makes that
movie a classic whodunit.

202
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:14,304
- Kelly has an eating disorder?
- Yes.

203
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:15,437
She always
eats my lunch.

204
00:10:15,513 --> 00:10:18,607
Anorexia.
She's an anorexitic.

205
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:20,043
We should do something.

206
00:10:20,118 --> 00:10:21,278
Nothing can be done.

207
00:10:21,353 --> 00:10:24,345
Just have to tell everybody
and hope for the best, I guess.

208
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,219
I'm worried about Erin because
she's not a very good worker.

209
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:30,818
I don't know how long
she's going to last here.

210
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:33,762
Really?
Yeah. So...

211
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:36,229
And Andy is gay.

212
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:37,995
Andy Bernard?
Mmm-hmm.

213
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,736
Did you
hear Pam is pregnant?

214
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:42,804
Really?
Yeah.

215
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,103
She's going to hate
being a mom.

216
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:54,910
What?
Tea.

217
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:57,716
So?
You would.

218
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:01,522
I like tea.
Oh, I bet you like it.

219
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:06,427
Yeah. I like it a lot.
I love tea.

220
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:09,626
Do you like it as much
as you like men's butts?

221
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:12,737
What?
Because you're gay.

222
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:20,042
Who told you that? Was it
Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi?

223
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:22,240
Or did you run into
someone from my high school?

224
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:26,412
This is not the first time rumors
about me being gay have come up.

225
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:28,313
Twice before, actually.

226
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:34,182
Just a weird coincidence.
It's a little too weird.

227
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:40,496
Almost makes you wonder if it's
not a coincidence at all. Whoa!

228
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:42,865
Which it is, of course.

229
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:46,126
But it makes you wonder.

230
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:50,405
Did you hear the rumor
about me, that I'm gay?

231
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:52,540
I did, yes.

232
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:55,269
And?
What?

233
00:11:57,115 --> 00:12:01,176
Do you think it's true?
Do you think that I'm gay?

234
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:02,779
Are you attracted
to other men?

235
00:12:05,623 --> 00:12:06,647
No.

236
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:09,893
But let me kick
you a scenario.

237
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:14,394
I'm at, like, a beach cabana
and Brad Pitt approaches,

238
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:16,157
tries to lean in
and kiss me.

239
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:24,104
I would definitely resist, like,
at first, but if he was persistent,

240
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:29,606
I might give in a little bit to
just sort of see what it felt like.

241
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:35,747
Would I push him away? How hard? Like,
what if he's, like, really aggressive?

242
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,859
If you resisted Brad Pitt a little
bit, he would still need to get to you?

243
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:46,090
This is not real Brad Pitt, this is,
like, in my... This is my fantasy.

244
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:50,199
Or it's, like, not fantasy, it's,
like, what I'm... It's just a scenario.

245
00:12:50,668 --> 00:12:56,834
Well, I wish I could help you. I don't...
You might be gay. You might be gay.

246
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,678
What exactly
is my responsibility here?

247
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:04,271
To comfort insecure
heterosexual men?

248
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:06,317
That can't possibly
fall to me.

249
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:07,575
How far along is Pam?

250
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:09,244
A few months. That's why
they're rushing the wedding.

251
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,517
Guys, guys, guys, you
can't believe everything you hear.

252
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,751
Like Stanley
having an affair.

253
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:17,818
That is crazy.
There's no stock in it.

254
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:21,027
It's a weird day for false
facts. Just let it go.

255
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:27,095
Okay, everybody, big day. Last day
for our interns. Lot of other stuff.

256
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:31,533
Who knows what to believe?
Dwight, the honors.

257
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:38,007
Present these to the Dean for credit.
And as a gift, I've attached my card.

258
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:40,107
Call me any time
of the day or night.

259
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:41,747
Why would we call
you at night?

260
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,245
Well, now you can't call me
at all, so problem solved.

261
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,880
You're going to regret that
when you find yourself

262
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,017
between a moose
and her cubs at night.

263
00:13:49,294 --> 00:13:52,263
Look to the intern on your
left. Now to your right.

264
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:56,228
One of you will do exceedingly well
in business, just unlimited potential.

265
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:59,870
One of you will make a
living and nothing more.

266
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:03,900
And one of you will make a great mother.

267
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,573
It's up to you to choose
which you want to be.

268
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:12,511
I am so happy
you're eating again.

269
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:13,812
Me, too.

270
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:16,350
Tuna, how come you never
try to set me up?

271
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:19,714
I don't really do that. But Pam
might have some friends, though.

272
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,448
Women friends?
Yeah.

273
00:14:21,793 --> 00:14:23,055
Not guy friends?

274
00:14:23,394 --> 00:14:25,624
Are you interested
in her guy friends?

275
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:28,427
No. I mean, for the
record, I prefer women.

276
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:31,627
Okay. But off the record,
I'm kind of confused.

277
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,928
Really?

278
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:36,131
Yeah, the evidence is sort of
stacked against me, I feel like.

279
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:38,435
Well, you've got to figure
this out. Yeah, right?

280
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:39,703
Yeah.
How?

281
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:41,540
You've got to have
sex with a woman.

282
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:42,637
Righto.

283
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:44,682
And then a man.
And then compare.

284
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:45,738
Oh!

285
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:49,008
All right.

286
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:50,343
Well, hey.
Yep.

287
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:52,616
Congratulations to you.
On what?

288
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:54,349
Come on.

289
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:59,056
Little baby Tuna.
Little junior Toro.

290
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:04,827
You know, a baby conceived out
of wedlock is still a bastard.

291
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,930
What?

292
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:08,097
Want me to say it again?

293
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:09,730
Why did that come
into your brain?

294
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:11,274
Can I talk to you
for a second?

295
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:14,510
So, they know.

296
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:16,905
Who did you tell? I didn't
tell anyone. Who did you tell?

297
00:15:16,981 --> 00:15:18,141
Nobody.

298
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:22,084
Hey, did one of you tell Stanley
that I have asthma? Because I don't.

299
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:24,417
If it gets out they
won't let me scuba.

300
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:27,981
If I can't scuba, then
what's this all been about?

301
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:29,424
What am I working toward?

302
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,052
What? You think I'm the
voice of the Taco Bell dog?

303
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:37,824
What are you guys talking about? I have
a daughter. How could I be a virgin?

304
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:41,196
Hey, has everyone heard a crazy
rumor about themselves today?

305
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:42,432
Yes.

306
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:45,067
Yeah, yeah! You know what,
let's discredit these rumors.

307
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:47,270
Yeah, sure, but who's been
saying all that stuff?

308
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:50,508
It's not important, Jim. I just think
we shouldn't listen to any of this crap.

309
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:52,412
Sure, but we should
get to the bottom of this.

310
00:15:52,483 --> 00:15:54,508
Let's pick a rumor and trace
it back to the beginning.

311
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:56,280
I need to do
mine first.

312
00:15:56,688 --> 00:16:00,180
Who's been saying that there's
another person inside of me

313
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,517
working me
with controls?

314
00:16:02,727 --> 00:16:05,025
I heard that from Andy.

315
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:06,594
I heard it from Erin.

316
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:07,688
What?

317
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:09,426
I heard it from Michael.

318
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:11,257
Michael.

319
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:14,193
Michael?

320
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:16,566
He's over here.

321
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:18,741
Where are you going?
Nowhere.

322
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,103
Michael.
Hmm?

323
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:26,617
You told people that
I use store-bought manure,

324
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:31,279
when I showed you where
my manure comes from.

325
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:33,857
Hmm? Hmm?

326
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:36,257
Don't get on it.
Michael, don't.

327
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:39,125
- Don't get on. Do not.
- Michael, no.

328
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:40,459
Michael.
Stay, Michael.

329
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:42,226
Step away.
Stay.

330
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,824
- Come on, boss.
- No. No.

331
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:48,637
Okay, I made it all up. KELLY: What?

332
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:50,438
Even the fact
that I'm gay?

333
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,168
Yes.
Yes!

334
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:55,503
But, guys, I'm a victim here, too. Okay?

335
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:57,774
People have been saying
that I'm a J. Crew model.

336
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,779
No, we heard
that about Jim.

337
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:03,981
Jim? No, no, I spread the rumor that
somebody here was a J. Crew model

338
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:05,386
and I was referring
to myself.

339
00:17:05,556 --> 00:17:06,682
How is that
a bad rumor?

340
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:10,694
Because a lot of people think that models,
even though they're very attractive,

341
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:14,254
are somewhat vapid. It's set
our industry back quite a bit.

342
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:18,358
Michael, why? Why say all these
things? Why make up an eating disorder,

343
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:21,128
Stanley's affair,
me being a spokesdog?

344
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:23,173
You told everyone
I was having an affair?

345
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:24,970
Okay, okay,
here's the thing.

346
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:30,777
There was one true rumor out there today. I
didn't want everybody to know what it was,

347
00:17:30,915 --> 00:17:34,146
so all of you are off the hook
except for this one person.

348
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,510
Well, then what's
the one true rumor?

349
00:17:36,587 --> 00:17:37,918
We have a right to know.

350
00:17:38,122 --> 00:17:40,852
Michael, am I gay?

351
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,219
The one true rumor, and this is going
to ruin this person's life, is that...

352
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:47,286
That Pam's pregnant.

353
00:17:47,465 --> 00:17:49,626
I knew it, I knew it.
I knew it!

354
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:53,531
Her breasts were a tiny bit
bigger. At first, I thought,

355
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:56,036
"Oh! She has a new
bra with padding."

356
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,906
But then I thought,
"Pam doesn't need padding."

357
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:01,768
It just didn't
add up, Jim.

358
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:03,108
Okay, thank you.

359
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:04,170
Congratulations!

360
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:06,239
- That's really great, you guys.
- Don't vaccinate it.

361
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:07,807
Who's the father?
Jim.

362
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:09,443
- How far along?
- Four months.

363
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:11,377
Who's the OB-GYN?
Stop. Don't.

364
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:16,860
All right, you know, this is not the truth
and you can't fall on the sword this way.

365
00:18:17,261 --> 00:18:20,924
The real thing is that
Stanley Hudson had an affair.

366
00:18:20,998 --> 00:18:22,329
No.
Yes.

367
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,458
Thank you for trying
to defend us,

368
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:25,593
but actually Pam is pregnant
and we can prove it.

369
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,069
Yes. If everybody would
like to see the proof.

370
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:28,571
Wanna... Okay.
Okay.

371
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:30,733
We're just
going to wait here?

372
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:32,070
What's the proof,
I mean...

373
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:40,381
It's true!
Pam, look at that!

374
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:43,610
That is the inside
of your vagina.

375
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:45,451
That's not how
it works but...

376
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:50,483
It's clear why we were trying not to
tell people. That's clear now. Yeah.

377
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:57,664
How long have you known
about the pregnancy?

378
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:02,295
A week? A month? A year?

379
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:04,938
Michael, we only told
our parents last week.

380
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:06,666
Did you pee on a stick?

381
00:19:06,744 --> 00:19:09,304
I did. But it
was inconclusive.

382
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:12,049
You should have told me.

383
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:14,511
You're right.

384
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:17,515
We should have realized that
you are an equal part of this.

385
00:19:20,057 --> 00:19:21,046
Yes.

386
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,956
Michael, Teri Hudson
returning your call.

387
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:25,595
You called Stanley's wife?

388
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:27,062
Oh! Oh!

389
00:19:27,598 --> 00:19:30,328
Yeah, a long time ago. Just to
make sure she was out of town.

390
00:19:30,668 --> 00:19:32,067
Oh, God.
Don't take it.

391
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:34,362
No, I have to take it
or it'll seem suspicious.

392
00:19:34,438 --> 00:19:36,565
If you talk to her, you're
going to tell her about Stanley

393
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:37,972
and that's going to
seem more suspicious.

394
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:39,907
No, no, no, I can do this.
You can't do this.

395
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:44,676
Yes, I can. I am going to tell her
that I need to redecorate my condo

396
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:45,807
and I need her help.

397
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:48,784
We will haggle about money,
and I will back down,

398
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:51,980
and then I won't talk to her until
this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.

399
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:53,080
Sounds terrible.
We think you should...

400
00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:54,181
Michael, please don't.

401
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:55,984
Hey, what up, Cynthia?

402
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:04,666
Just hang on a second,
Cynthia.

403
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:17,309
Well, it turns out that
Teri was already suspicious

404
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:21,408
because she had caught Stanley
and Cynthia a few months ago.

405
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:26,622
So Stanley promised that he would
stop, and he did. End of story.

406
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:28,750
Well, not exactly.

407
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:32,053
Cynthia kept calling him.

408
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:35,155
She would not stop calling him,
and she was in love with him.

409
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,963
And get this.
Cynthia, also married.

410
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:42,502
So, you can't stop love,
I guess.

411
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,036
And quite frankly, I don't
think you should ever even try.

412
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:56,478
I learned that a company can describe their
internship as full of exciting experiences,

413
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:59,821
even if that's a lie.
There's no regulation.

414
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:03,389
I learned that half these people's
e-mail password is "Password."

415
00:21:03,794 --> 00:21:07,025
I learned that a ream
of paper is 300 sheets.

416
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:08,497
I thought it was 500.

417
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:10,891
Oh!

418
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:13,070
I guess I didn't
learn anything.

419
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:17,168
I learned that if you look even
the tiniest bit like Jet Li,

420
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,404
Michael will call you
Jet Li all summer.

421
00:21:20,611 --> 00:21:22,841
Julia Stiles.
Alan Thicke.
