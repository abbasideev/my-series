1
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:06,923
Hey, so this isn't
matching up with this,

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,466
and I'm not sure
which one is right.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,177
Can you just hunt down
the original for me?

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,761
Yes, me do.

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,513
All right.

6
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,520
Hey, Kev, what were you saying
before about the paperwork?

7
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:24,441
Me do it now.
Go. Stop worry.

8
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,860
Kevin, do you feel okay?

9
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:30,864
Me feel good. Body strong.
Sleep big last night.

10
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,365
Yeah, I think we should
get him to the hospital.

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,825
Yeah, all right, Kev,
why don't you come with us?

12
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,535
No, he's fine. OSCAR:
No, no, guys. He's fine.

13
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,703
He's always
been like that.

14
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:37,829
No, he hasn't.

15
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,582
I mean, he's gotten worse
over the years, but...

16
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,917
He's making a statement.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,169
It's an ironic comment
on our expectations of him.

18
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,672
A funhouse image of
our model of Kevin.

19
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,466
You keep think that.

20
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,177
Me mechanic
not speak English,

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,639
but he know what me mean
when me say, "Car no go."

22
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,224
And we best friends.

23
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:02,145
So me think why waste time say
lot word when few word do trick.

24
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,774
Kevin, I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

25
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:06,900
Thank.

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,070
Here we have
a word code.

27
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,571
Same way we have
a dress code.

28
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,199
And what we're
talking about is

29
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,162
basically the speech equivalent
to just wearing underpants.

30
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,209
Sometimes words
you no need use

31
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,879
but need need
for talk talk.

32
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,924
But save time.
More success.

33
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,885
Does it save time, though? Because
we've been here for about an hour.

34
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,220
No me fault.

35
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:40,141
Kevin, at most you're saving
a microscopic amount of time.

36
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,145
Many small time
make big time.

37
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,314
What are you going to
do with all this time?

38
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,066
See world.

39
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,777
Kevin, you can't possibly save
enough time to see the world.

40
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,447
Kevin, are you saying "see
the world" or SeaWorld?

41
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:59,619
See world. Oceans.
Fish. Jump. China.

42
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,998
No, see? Right there, that's
the problem with your method

43
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,084
because I still don't know if you're
saying SeaWorld or "see the world."

44
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,711
And it's taking a lot
of time to explain it.

45
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,673
Fine,
fine, I'll talk normally.

46
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,719
When me president,
they see.

47
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:18,763
They see.

48
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:57,218
This week we are rolling out the
brand new Sabre tablet, the Pyramid.

49
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,054
Why is it
shaped like that?

50
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,599
So you can tell your clients,
"Unleash the power of the pyramid.”

51
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,726
It's huge.
How much does it weigh?

52
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,519
Oh, no, no, no.
Without the battery pack

53
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,897
and the optional memory
booster, it's barely 3 pounds.

54
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,565
How much memory does
it have without the booster?

55
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,775
Fifty I.

56
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,360
- I'm sorry, "L"?
- Mmm-hmm.

57
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,694
How many L to a K?

58
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,112
You're really
going to want the booster.

59
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,238
How on earth are
we supposed to sell...

60
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,365
I'll take five.

61
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,867
Andy, don't make us
sell this stupid thing.

62
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,452
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
This is Dwight's meeting.

63
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,496
Thank you. The...
I just wanted to pop in

64
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,123
and get your opinions
on ties and tie clips.

65
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,209
Which combo do you think
Robert's going to like more?

66
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,460
What do you think, C-Span?

67
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,214
"C-Span"?

68
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,383
Yeah, C-Span.
Cocker spaniel.

69
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,968
Spaniel because of your Spanish
bloodline. Cocker because...

70
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,766
Is this really the best use
of our collective time?

71
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,727
I am still forming a first
impression with Robert.

72
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,230
Once it is formed,
we can all relax, okay?

73
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,650
I'm sorry to hijack your meeting,
D-Dub-Dog, had to pull rank.

74
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,447
Okay, let's look
at some ties.

75
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,158
Here's how I'm going
to help out from now on.

76
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,785
I'm going to not care.

77
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,662
And I'm going to
sit around quietly

78
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,997
waiting for Andy's
inevitable demise.

79
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,458
Your friend
Neil Patrick Harris

80
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,252
really made me laugh
the other night.

81
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,003
D Dog, you have a message.

82
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,839
Erin, you don't
need to call him that.

83
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,924
Andy wants us to, P Dog.

84
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,676
It's okay, E Dog.
Who called?

85
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,511
Justine. She said
she's coming by later.

86
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,304
Your ex-wife?

87
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,764
Wait, I thought
she was a

88
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,558
And you
hated her guts.

89
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,644
No, no, no, I like her.

90
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,604
Well, I was just
quoting you.

91
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,857
I would never say that about
her. I don't know the woman.

92
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,735
No, man. We get
along now, real well.

93
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,612
All right.
Can't wait to meet her.

94
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,197
I'll introduce you.

95
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,491
Yeah, we had a few fights,
I suppose,

96
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,161
but last night we put
a lot of that to bed.

97
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,539
I can't tell you what I did
with my ex-wife last night.

98
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,000
I have to sing it.

99
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,960
We took a shower

100
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,837
We were naked

101
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,338
We...

102
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,975
Oh.

103
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,437
Hi, Dad. I...
Oh, boy.

104
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,065
Hello, Andy.
Excellent tie.

105
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,235
Would you be requiring a cold
beverage while you're here?

106
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,987
I'd love some coffee.

107
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,617
I was looking over your projections
and I think we can do better.

108
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,289
Are you factoring in the whole
national economy declining and all that?

109
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,166
Andy, do you know
why I chose you?

110
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,418
I think I can sum it up
with what I think

111
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,629
is your favorite
ice cream flavor.

112
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,756
Vanilla?

113
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,965
Vanilla? No.

114
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,886
You'll never guess in a million
billion years, you'll never guess.

115
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:49,140
You were saying you chose me.
There was a reason.

116
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,521
Andy, can you inspire?
Do you have that skillset?

117
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,609
Can I inspire?
I don't know.

118
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,612
I don't know.

119
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,281
Oh, thank you.

120
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,366
Oh, sorry.

121
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,992
Yeah, just put it down.

122
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,587
Mmm.

123
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,840
That is very cold.

124
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,717
Yeah, it's old.

125
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,262
Why would I...

126
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,346
I asked if you
wanted a cold beverage

127
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,639
and you said coffee.

128
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:34,018
Why don't we get Robert a nice,
hot, fresh cup and I will have this.

129
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,436
Andy, you don't
want that.

130
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,981
I've been craving a
freezing cup of old coffee.

131
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,232
Mmm.

132
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,441
Sorry.

133
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,861
You like her.

134
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,615
I do. Yeah.

135
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,992
She likes you.

136
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,953
You know, we've both been
into each other at different times

137
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,705
and just never
really synced up.

138
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,832
Now we're in this weird
dance and now we're...

139
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,709
I'm afraid you've
lost my interest.

140
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,588
Let me call you back.

141
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,755
I got to go.

142
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,387
If the office
superstore was supposed to

143
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,764
put us little suppliers
out of business,

144
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,349
why are we still here?

145
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,104
Yeah.
This is where we go.

146
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,190
You'd go some place else.
That's not it. That's not the answer.

147
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,359
It's a answer.
It's a wrong answer.

148
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,819
There are no wrong answers.

149
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,571
Take a look
at where you are.

150
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:32,368
Where you once worked in a dying
industry, you now work at its birth.

151
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:37,373
Those superstores
are terrified of us.

152
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,125
Anybody know why?

153
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,629
Wait, they're terrified?

154
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,548
Let me tell you how I
buy something these days.

155
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,468
I know what I want, I go on the
Internet and get the best price.

156
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:54,140
Or I don't know what I want and I
go to a small store that can help me.

157
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:58,561
The era of personal service
is back. You are back.

158
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,482
You'll find that customers
will pay our higher prices

159
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,108
and then they will
thank us,

160
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,195
and we will say to them,
"You are welcome."

161
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,660
Thank you.

162
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,911
Ooh!

163
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,832
Andrew, I chose you for a
reason. Lead these people.

164
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,835
Show me the best numbers
this place has ever seen.

165
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,381
Last quarter we saw
4% growth. Double it.

166
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,924
You got it.
Double.

167
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,008
Done.
I'm not kidding.

168
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,259
Neither am I.
It's already done.

169
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:32,929
I'm just kidding.

170
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,681
It's going to take
some time. Double.

171
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,939
Hey.

172
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,744
What's up, guys?

173
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,664
Just thought we'd have
a little rap session.

174
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,625
Talk about business.
See how things are going.

175
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,422
Why don't you start?

176
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,881
If no one else wants to.

177
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,802
I was just thinking about
Robert. Man, what a boss.

178
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,597
Just throws down goals,
you know?

179
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,183
Anyway, how's the sales
doubling project going?

180
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,601
Yeah, how are we
supposed to do that?

181
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,395
We can't just
press a magic button.

182
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,772
Of course not.
There's no magic button.

183
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:28,067
You have to summon that.

184
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,070
If we could just double our
sales, we already would have.

185
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,572
You're not
making any sense.

186
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,157
He brings up
two good points.

187
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,994
Do you have any new leads? Any
new territories you want us to look into?

188
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,996
Maybe have an in
with a big client

189
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,664
that we could get
our foot in the door?

190
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,750
Dwight, anything?

191
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,794
We could talk about
how fast children grow up

192
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,671
and before you know it,
they're out of the house.

193
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:52,216
You know what? We need to
get our heads out of the box.

194
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,051
If we did have something,

195
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,638
what would it look like?
What would it be?

196
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,806
Tuna.

197
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,933
New leads, new
territory to look into,

198
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,351
maybe an in with
a big company

199
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,896
that we could get
our foot in the door.

200
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,648
Fart.

201
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,027
Good sesh.

202
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,863
That leg's asleep.

203
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,826
Hello.

204
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,329
I'm looking for
Darryl Philbin?

205
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,538
Don't...

206
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,748
Oh...

207
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,167
You must think... No,
I'm not. I'm using the fax.

208
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,710
This isn't...
No, wait.

209
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,463
I'm not supposed to
represent the company, right?

210
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,006
There's usually
an Erin here, so...

211
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,216
Okay.

212
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,676
Darryl, a girl!

213
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,599
Rub a dub, dub, apricot scrub

214
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,767
What's up, darling?

215
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,644
Everybody,
this is Justine.

216
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,979
- Hi, Justine.
- Hello.

217
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,816
This is Jim, Oscar.

218
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:50,858
Hi.

219
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,944
Everybody.

220
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,445
Kevin.

221
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,159
Can we go
some place private?

222
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,911
Follow me.
I got a space.

223
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,582
After you. I've been thinking
about you all morning.

224
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,377
I don't know what you did,
I can barely walk today.

225
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,259
D Bone, there you are.

226
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,178
Let me guess.
Somebody needs a brownie.

227
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,263
Lick the spoon?

228
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,389
No. No. That's okay.

229
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,058
I just,
I wanted to ask you about...

230
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,518
Is this about
the profits?

231
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,855
Because if it is, I just don't
see the point. It's so Wall Street.

232
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,108
I know, right? Yeah.

233
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,318
Um...

234
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,779
How is everything?

235
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,156
Good.
Really, really good.

236
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,242
Must be a tough time
to be a family farm.

237
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,287
It is. And beets are not immune.

238
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,874
I made some inroads in salad, but
heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.

239
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,459
What are
you going to do about that?

240
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,795
I don't know,
what do you mean?

241
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,922
Got to be some way you
could double your beet sales.

242
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,967
You wanted the job, the
job is yours, just do the job.

243
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,888
And I'll do mine.

244
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,141
Walnuts?

245
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,976
No!

246
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,025
Have you seen this?

247
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,192
Parenting? Yeah.

248
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,611
This is Cece's
favorite magazine.

249
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,321
She loves
the pictures of babies.

250
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,615
She looks at it when she's on
the potty and she makes the faces.

251
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,116
Have you read it?

252
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,703
Has an adult member of your
family read this particular issue?

253
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,955
I flipped through it.

254
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,291
So you saw the article
on the importance of

255
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,585
taking frequent walks
while you're pregnant?

256
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,378
- Of course, yeah.
- We know that.

257
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,881
I will be taking a morning
walk and an afternoon walk.

258
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,674
Would you like to
join me?

259
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,759
That sounds nice.

260
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,843
Great.

261
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,846
You have a walking buddy.

262
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,556
I do.

263
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,600
Thanks for
coming in, guys.

264
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,144
You don't have to thank
us for coming in. It's our job.

265
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,730
Well, I never got thanked
for coming into a meeting,

266
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,857
and I always wanted to be,
so I'm going to thank people.

267
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,817
What's under the blanket?

268
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,528
This is what's
under the blanket.

269
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,031
We don't get it.

270
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,910
These are incentives. It's how
we're going to double growth.

271
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,664
Now, you're probably all asking
yourselves, "Well, how does this work?"

272
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,501
It seems like a basic reward
system where you give us points

273
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,878
and then we redeem
those points for prizes.

274
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,964
You're exactly right
and you get a point.

275
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,174
Oh.
Uh, is that a vibrator?

276
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,717
20 points.

277
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,885
How does one get a point?

278
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,512
I've outlined
the exact parameters

279
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,138
in an email,
so check your spam folders.

280
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,725
But basically, you do your
job better, you get points.

281
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:34,146
So collect 15 points and
redeem them for this polar bear.

282
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,441
Why is it all kids' stuff
and a vibrator? It's so gross.

283
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,402
There's lots of stuff.

284
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,071
John Irving, collected
works, 22 points.

285
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:48,411
Or you can pool your points and
redeem 55 for this maternity shirt. Ahem!

286
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,746
How about you want us to
work harder, pay us more.

287
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,831
I can't.

288
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,374
This points system
is really insulting.

289
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,625
Ooh!

290
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,712
I didn't mean to offend you
and I hope you'll forgive me

291
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,298
because I am very,
very "sari." 16 points.

292
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,550
That's a tablecloth.

293
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,343
What if we went all the
way up to 500 points?

294
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,845
That's a crazy
amount of points.

295
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,888
But what if?
Well, what do you want?

296
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,182
I don't know.
For such a crazy number,

297
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,642
I'd like
something pretty crazy.

298
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,979
All right, for 500 points,
I will wear a dress to work.

299
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,443
That's pretty good. What
about for 1,000 points?

300
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,528
I'll run naked
through the parking lot

301
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,030
with a donut
on my ding dong.

302
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,532
Yeah, you like that?

303
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,951
All right,
for 5,000 points,

304
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,787
I will let you
tattoo whatever you want

305
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,623
on the stern of
the old S.S. Bernard.

306
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,375
No.
Really?

307
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,377
All right. All right. And
you are totally serious?

308
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,963
Swear to God. Hope to die.
Now let's get to work.

309
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,799
Wait, but you did say we
can pool our points, right?

310
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,634
In that case,

311
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,344
- let's get to work, guys.
- Yeah!

312
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,889
Let's do it, guys.

313
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,140
Good!

314
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,977
I can have it to you by
the beginning of next week.

315
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,353
All right,
thank you very much.

316
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,231
Phyllis, Brachen Auto?

317
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,067
Ask for Donald.
Karen's bananas.

318
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,318
Okay.

319
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,528
T-Bag-Bone.

320
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,738
Andrew.

321
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,490
Hold on, one second.

322
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,077
Have you noticed a little bit
of a mood shift around here?

323
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,245
No. I haven't
noticed anything.

324
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:18,918
Really? Because I sat next to
Stanley for years and this is nap time.

325
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,087
Open eye nap time. He
balances the phone on his shoulder

326
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,171
and just powers down.

327
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,255
Now look at him.

328
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,467
You've got to unleash
the power of the pyramid.

329
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,469
I don't know what
to tell you, man.

330
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,223
Do you think it has something
to do with that incentive program?

331
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,183
Oh, 100%. We all want
to see you tattoo your ass.

332
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,518
Uh...

333
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,104
I think people thought I
was kidding when I said that.

334
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,438
No. You definitely
weren't kidding.

335
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,065
That came across
loud and clear.

336
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,733
Oh, by the way,
I want to hand this in.

337
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:43,943
120 points?

338
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,194
Yeah. Big sale.

339
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,155
Don't worry about it, though. I
don't really care about the points.

340
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,907
I would like
a point receipt though.

341
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,284
Hey, yes, this is Jim
Halpert calling for Donald.

342
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,495
Can you hold on for one
second? Thank you very much.

343
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,248
Who talked to
Maggie at Kaufman's?

344
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,964
And I'm back.
How are you, sir?

345
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,051
I think you can squeeze a
couple more golf games in, right?

346
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,054
Where's Angela?
Angela, these are yours.

347
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,809
Hey, Kevin,
what are you doing?

348
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,060
Don't talk to me.

349
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,235
Yeah.

350
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,072
Hi. Professor Frank.
Andy Bernard, class of '95.

351
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:35,452
Hey there, I'm a huge fan of your
management book, Management.

352
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,831
Uh, quick question, I may
be missing a chapter here:

353
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,667
"De-incentivizing."
What are your strategies?

354
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,419
I'm looking for
a real blow to morale.

355
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,588
Uh, why?

356
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,673
Well, um,

357
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,675
I guess you could say
I'm in one of those

358
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,553
classic ass-tattoo-incentive
situations.

359
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,107
Took 'em one day.

360
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,859
Are you ready?

361
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,114
I like it. I like it.

362
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,621
Okay, keep in mind, it's not
too late to choose another prize

363
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,707
and there are some
great new additions.

364
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,793
My car.
For 1,000 points.

365
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,295
Or best offer.

366
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,379
What else you got?

367
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,340
Oh, and then this
was Phyllis' idea.

368
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,633
Oh! >

369
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,427
So nasty, Phyllis.

370
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,637
Oh, my God!

371
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,685
We were hoping you
could do something like this.

372
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,896
So coming out of
his butt is a...

373
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:44,939
Baby.

374
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,649
Baby. "

375
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,275
Yeah. No problem.

376
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,239
We should think about this. Does
anyone have any better ideas?

377
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,865
I like what we have.

378
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,492
Yeah, nice try.

379
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,077
It's pretty edgy.

380
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,123
I just need
a second outside.

381
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,008
You getting psyched up?
Yeah.

382
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,052
Andy, nobody really expects
you to go through with this.

383
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,846
Toons, what am I
doing here?

384
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,392
Why did Robert pick me?

385
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,645
Confession, I don't
know what I'm doing.

386
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,814
I mean,
do you like it?

387
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,899
You having fun?

388
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,945
I'll tell you this, everybody
else is having a lot of fun.

389
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,155
And you did that.

390
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,575
My ass is only so big. I
mean, I can't do this every day.

391
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,286
But I think it's big enough
to buy you some time

392
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,954
until your next
great idea.

393
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,581
Which, by the way,
I can't wait for.

394
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,462
No one expects me to
go through with this, right?

395
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,880
Absolutely not.

396
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,846
Let's ink my stink.

397
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,307
Yeah!

398
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,353
My heart belongs to music, but
my ass belongs to these people.

399
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,315
Whoa!

400
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,693
Do your worst.

401
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,197
Uh, you can keep your
pants on actually.

402
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,575
If you just drop them
down a bit, that'd be great.

403
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,160
They are already off,
my good sir.

404
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,078
I'd really prefer
they not be down.

405
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,665
Well, I think down's better.
Sweating pretty heavily down there.

406
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,547
Do you think you
could work from this?

407
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,007
We made some
small adjustments.

408
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,133
Okay, you want me to...

409
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,509
Just those few
adjustments. Yeah.

410
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,054
All right.
Let's begin.

411
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,889
This is where I grin
and bear... Ow, ow!

412
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,015
That was just
a cotton swab.

413
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,184
Invest in
softer cotton, sir.

414
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,273
Ow!

415
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,612
Oh!

416
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,282
Obviously you can go
the ass tattoo route

417
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,785
and obviously I'm
going to like it.

418
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,037
Draw some blood!
Ha-ha!

419
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,715
Why did I choose
Andy to run the office?

420
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:21,637
Because he's all surface, uncomplicated.
What you see is what you get.

421
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,224
It could be a recipe
for mediocrity, yes.

422
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,810
But then again, it might just
be why people fight for him.

423
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,898
It's a Nard dog.

424
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,151
That's my nickity name.

425
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,987
I love it. I love it.

426
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,322
Pull up your pants.

427
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,700
There's something
about an underdog

428
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,995
that really
inspires the unexceptional.

429
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,626
Um, what should we
talk about?

430
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,088
Well, we could talk about
an ethical dilemma I'm having.

431
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,674
Oh, yeah, sure.
I hope I can help.

432
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,927
A coworker of mine is
drinking caffeine while pregnant

433
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,763
and I don't know if I should
call social services about it.

434
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,515
Angela, that's
pretty transparently me.

435
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,183
Maybe.

436
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,561
You know,
it's just herbal tea.

437
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,063
In mugs with trace
amounts of coffee.

438
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,525
Yeah. I think you
should call social services.

439
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,651
I already did.

440
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,114
You know, maybe we should
just have our own pregnancies

441
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,491
and not pretend like
we're in this together.

442
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:25,617
Fine.

443
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,702
Fine.
