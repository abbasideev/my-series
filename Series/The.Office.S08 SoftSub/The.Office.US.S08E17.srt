1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:05,172
Today is the test launch
day for the inaugural Sabre store.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,635
And I, Dwight Schrute, am in
charge of the entire operation.

3
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:13,722
If I can prove myself today and
the store is a hit with the media,

4
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:17,601
and Nellie sees this,
the vice presidency is mine.

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,852
Hey, are you
holding this chair?

6
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,312
Because I feel like
I'm going to fall off.

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,022
Yeah. Yes. Yes. I'm not
wearing the right shoes for this.

8
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,190
We went
over this, okay?

9
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,733
Your tiny fingers
make the best knots.

10
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:28,278
Hey, strangers. I'm so stoked
for the Sabre store opening.

11
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:35,327
Hey, my name's Tabitha. I'm
camped out in front of the Sabre store

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,787
so I can be first in line
for the new Pyramid.

13
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,581
Psst!

14
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,542
It's me, Erin. Dwight had
me pretend to be a hipster

15
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,002
to create hype
and it's working.

16
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,630
There's already people
camped out behind me.

17
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,354
Test launch day, people.

18
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,067
Now, I would like to fill you
in on a little secret about me.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,902
To inspire you today.

20
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:12,322
Now I know you probably all
think I'm this patrician goddess.

21
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,324
But here's the truth.

22
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,452
I was born in the little
working-class town of Basildon,

23
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,996
and until the age of 32,

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,539
I talked like this.

25
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,042
Which was
bloody horrendous, innit?

26
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,004
I came from dirt.
No, lower than...

27
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,798
What's lower than dirt?

28
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,509
Loam. Magma. Mantle.
Outer core. Inner core.

29
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,429
Yeah, thank you. Loam.
Bloody loam I came from.

30
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,099
I hit rock bottom when I
auditioned for the Spice Girls.

31
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,850
I didn't even
get a callback.

32
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,977
Which Spice Girl?

33
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,144
The black one.

34
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,021
I never stood a chance.

35
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,107
Okay.

36
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,109
Now think about my
journey here today

37
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,736
and let it inspire
your journey.

38
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,155
Okay. Nellie, thank
you. Thank you so much.

39
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,282
Yep. Yep.

40
00:01:55,365 --> 00:02:00,662
Today is press day, and press is
going to make or break this store.

41
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:04,374
And for a tech company, press
can only mean one thing, bloggers.

42
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,293
Dossier on bloggers.

43
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:11,548
Bloggers are gross. Bloggers
are obese. Bloggers have halitosis.

44
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,550
You're going to love them.

45
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,678
Ryan is going to be
the main event today.

46
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,055
He is the pitchman
who is going to give

47
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,308
the feisty yet
profound speech

48
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,852
worthy of a world's fair.
Ryan, you ready to do this?

49
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,145
When people see
this presentation,

50
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,563
they're going to
in their pants.

51
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,731
- Come on, man.
- Come on.

52
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,733
Okay.
Seriously disgusting.

53
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,901
Cathy, you will be the hot
girl who talks to bloggers.

54
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,487
Ugh! Kill me.
It was my idea.

55
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,282
Packer, you will be the sexual
predator who has come to prey

56
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,410
on the trendy teenage girls who
are obsessed with the Pyramid.

57
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,078
Ah...

58
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,330
That is excellent.

59
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,581
I don't see what
that gets us,

60
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,749
but I'm a team player.

61
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,000
Perfect casting, right?

62
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,170
Schrute's out to get me,
but I'm playing the long game.

63
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:54,007
As soon as he messes up, I
swoop in like a sexual predator.

64
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,429
I want to create a sense
of wonder and enthusiasm,

65
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:03,850
as if at the end of E.T., candy
poured out of the screen.

66
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,560
Do you understand?

67
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,645
I want to get
goose pimples.

68
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,817
Speaking of pimples,
let's release the bloggers!

69
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,945
Morning, everyone.

70
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,697
Oh, Andy, guess what
happened to me this morning.

71
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,574
Don't care. Tell me
later. Listen, it's important.

72
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,909
You've got to hear this.

73
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:23,995
What do you got?

74
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,955
Oh, my God.
Do you have a black eye?

75
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,248
Yes, I do, Phyllis.

76
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,209
I woke up at 4:00 a.m.
by accident,

77
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,086
in time for
the paper to be delivered.

78
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,170
Guess what?

79
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,882
It's not a kid on a bike.
It's a man in a car.

80
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,509
Andy, who punched you?

81
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,678
Hey, I was on the can. What's
this about a black guy in the office?

82
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,555
Black eye, Meredith.

83
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,307
Will someone please explain
what's going on here?

84
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:48,061
Since the interesting thing happened
until now, so much time has passed.

85
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,521
It's like my
life is buffering.

86
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,900
Here's what happened. Pam
and I were arriving for the day

87
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:58,571
and there was a gang in the
parking lot, on bikes, on motorcycles.

88
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,907
And they just
were hassling Pam.

89
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,158
That's true.

90
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,618
They had weapons.

91
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,744
Weapons.

92
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,455
I just stepped in lo talk
some sense into them.

93
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,708
But these were not the kind
of people who use their words.

94
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,461
Punches were going,
and I ducked a few,

95
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,880
landed a couple, and
I was fighting them off.

96
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,175
It was a totally,
like, senseless crime.

97
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,136
Thank goodness he was
there. - Good job, Andy.

98
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,224
I didn't do anything any
of you wouldn't have done.

99
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,476
Open the gates!

100
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,480
There's plenty for
everyone. No need to panic.

101
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,983
There's plenty for
everyone. There's plenty...

102
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,569
Don't stampede.
No need to stampede, sir.

103
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:42,866
Okay, okay! Hey, hey! It's going
to be fine! It's going to be fine!

104
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,492
There's plenty of Pyramids!

105
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,244
Come on,
I was in line before you.

106
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,621
So you're
a blogger, right?

107
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,873
Yeah.

108
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,124
Blogger.

109
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,042
God, stay away.

110
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,629
Oh, I always get in
trouble around bloggers.

111
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,381
I'm trying to be
a good girl for once.

112
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,385
Uh, yeah, I already bought my
Pyramid, but I don't want to leave yet.

113
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,805
I haven't had so much fun
since seeing Zooey Deschanel

114
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,058
at the Coachella
music festival. So fun.

115
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,603
How can we feel safe knowing
that there are gangs here?

116
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,354
We should call the police
right now! - Yes!

117
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,399
No, no, no, no, no, no! We
don't need to call the police.

118
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,401
They'll just ask
everybody questions,

119
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,236
get up In everyone's
business, right, Pam?

120
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,906
Police are a hassle. We
settled this on the street.

121
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,284
And my eye will heal.
But if the police come,

122
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,746
then we will forever stain our
neighborhood as a troubled area.

123
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,166
Why would you care what the
police think of our neighborhood?

124
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:37,420
Because I have
neighborhood pride. 18505!

125
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,755
18505

126
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,090
Guys, guys,
that's so vague.

127
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,176
You got to do
the zip plus four.

128
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:47,263
18505-7427.

129
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,100
Look, I don't feel safe. I
think we should call the police.

130
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,019
Yes. Exactly,
we need to feel safe,

131
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:57,607
which is why Toby is
teaching us self-defense.

132
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,527
Me?

133
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,111
Toby, will you
teach us self-defense?

134
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,031
Yeah. I can't believe
you remembered.

135
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,451
I do self-defense.
I'll go put on my cup.

136
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,245
Great.

137
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:11,871
- Yes!
- Okay.

138
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,998
I wasn't sure which
one of you was Chuck.

139
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,125
Yeah, no, it seems
to be going great.

140
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,462
Andy got beat up by
a fifth grade girl?

141
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,798
Look at that guy, he's
got a Sabre phone on him,

142
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,174
he's not even using it.

143
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,885
This is a perfect photo
for my daily fail blog.

144
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,888
Uh, I got to go.
Okay.

145
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,266
Dwight, what is a fail?
That sounds bad.

146
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,643
No, no, no, it's good.
It's really...

147
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,646
On the Internet, that's a
really good, good thing.

148
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,440
Are you trying to
sabotage this entire event?

149
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,608
I'm very sorry.

150
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:45,405
We gave you an Arrowhead
for free for the day.

151
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,241
How hard would it have
been to do this? Hmm?

152
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,830
Hello. Hi, sweetie, it's Jim. I'm
calling you from my new Arrowhead,

153
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,540
which is why my
voice is crystal clear

154
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,166
and my hand
won't ever get tired

155
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,419
because of
the ergonomic shape.

156
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:03,214
I'm really sorry. Is there anything I
can do? Maybe pretend to be Chuck?

157
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,716
You could have
pretended to be Chuck.

158
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,593
I begged you to
pretend to be Chuck.

159
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,554
But you chose to be yourself
and you can no longer be Chuck.

160
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,347
Surrender the tri-pack.

161
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,187
You know what
you have to do.

162
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,030
Point it towards
the store, idiot.

163
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,416
You know what I mean?

164
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,792
Pick one of these
buttons and just...

165
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,171
Damn it. Take over.

166
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,257
Oh, hey, hey, hey, you guys.
You must be lost.

167
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,301
Listen.
Excuse me, sir.

168
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,137
The fountain where you can feed
the pigeons is out behind the bank.

169
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,306
Tell your great-grandson
to bring his kid by.

170
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,475
Okay, so long.
Here we go.

171
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,560
Erin! Psst! Come on.

172
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,355
The elderly suck the life out of
the young. Get them out of here.

173
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,107
We are closed.
Come on.

174
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,653
Self-defense is not some
fun boxing match, okay?

175
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,321
This is about
escaping with your life.

176
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:12,158
So strike,
scream and run.

177
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,410
All right,
let's try it.

178
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,542
That may have
been my fault.

179
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,710
What the hell, Toby?

180
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,004
Okay, look, in a
real crisis situation,

181
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,673
you're not going to
have time to think.

182
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,926
Okay?
So just remember IAATG.

183
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,053
"It's All About The Groin."

184
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:37,308
What if you're being
attacked by a smallish man

185
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,268
who happens to
not have a groin?

186
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,354
I don't think
that's very common.

187
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,022
But what if
you're being attacked

188
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,900
by a 4'11" man
who's penis-less.

189
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,320
Why are you fixated on this
hypothetical transgendered attacker?

190
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,905
Why don't we
start with the basics?

191
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,949
Show us how to defend
ourself against a baby

192
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,785
and then like
a fifth-grade girl

193
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,996
and then, you know, if we
have time, on up to a scary man.

194
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:03,334
The most common scenario is a
larger man attacking a smaller female.

195
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:08,131
So in that scenario,
what if the victim

196
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,425
sucker punches
the attacker in the face?

197
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,886
What can the attacker then
do to better protect himself?

198
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,763
It's interesting
that you're drawn

199
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,682
to the point of
view of the attacker.

200
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,685
You would like
The Turn of the Table.

201
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,562
Okay? The latest
Chad Flenderman novel.

202
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,399
From the point of view of
his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Woo.

203
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,568
Can I please leave?
I have a rape flute.

204
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,987
All right, well, let's try one
simple technique together.

205
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,780
Okay, why doesn't
everyone stand?

206
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,574
Okay, so,
you're being attacked,

207
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,660
you've got your hands up,
simple palm strike to the chin.

208
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,163
Up to the chin.
One, two.

209
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,873
One, two.

210
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,333
One, two.

211
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,588
Cathy, I would like to introduce
you to Fatty Gruesome.

212
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,174
He is a freelancer
for Wired magazine.

213
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,259
Patty Grossman.
I'm a woman.

214
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,802
But you still work
for Wired, right?

215
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,012
Yes.
Good.

216
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,638
Okay. Flirt away.

217
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,851
Sabre. It's time
to come home.

218
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,731
Yeah.

219
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,526
Yeah. I mean, I think... It seemed
like you were a little nervous.

220
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,861
Yeah, no Sherlock.

221
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,529
Can somebody please tell
me something encouraging

222
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,697
about this presentation

223
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,783
before I go out there in front
of a million people and do it?

224
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,909
Okay. I know!
I know, champ.

225
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,911
Just calm down
because, listen,

226
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,704
when you are out in
front of all those people...

227
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,789
Yeah, what?

228
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,915
...you just
need to realize

229
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,126
so much rides on this.

230
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,836
You have no idea.

231
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,962
Dwight.

232
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,380
I'm trying to make
him feel important.

233
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,009
I wish Kelly were here.
She always knew what to say.

234
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:36,886
Um...

235
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,640
Oh, Ryan, you're so smart.

236
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,433
You're smarter
than Mark Zuckerberg

237
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,560
and those Google guys
all combined.

238
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,397
You're so ignorant. You barely
know what you're talking about.

239
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,233
It's so ridiculous.

240
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,652
You really need to
read a couple of books.

241
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,237
What's a book?

242
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,739
Oh, my God.
You're so embarrassing.

243
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,867
My mom would say
the best stuff though.

244
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,209
You can...

245
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,461
You can do it, Ryan.

246
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,964
And you know that
I'm capable of this?

247
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,341
You're the only one
who can do it, sweetie.

248
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,593
What did you think
of the presentation?

249
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,345
I thought
it was great, sweetie.

250
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,848
I would just
fix that one...

251
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,683
"Fix" means you hate it!
I knew it!

252
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,976
I need something
to drink!

253
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,227
Jim, get him a water.

254
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,603
No, not a water,
a sports drink!

255
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,938
I hate everything
in that fridge.

256
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,357
Not red! Get me
something yellow or green

257
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,234
from a nearby store.
Not red!

258
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,528
Why are you just
standing there?

259
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,114
Go to a nearby store and get
him a yellow or green sports drink.

260
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,744
Now if your attacker is
willing to defile a corpse,

261
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,122
you better stop
playing dead right away

262
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,915
and just make it known that you're
alive.

263
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,667
Forgive me
for interrupting.

264
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,045
I believe my daughter had an
altercation with somebody here,

265
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,673
some fancy gentleman
with a squeaky voice?

266
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,800
I think you
guys might have the wrong office.

267
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,719
That's him.
The guy I hit.

268
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,845
What?

269
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,555
You've
got to be kidding me.

270
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,973
Poor Andy.

271
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,227
First you got beat up by a
gang and now she kicks your ass.

272
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,270
No, Kevin.

273
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,355
What about the lady
you hit with a pinecone?

274
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,982
There.
That chubby one.

275
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,276
I just had a baby.

276
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,569
Yesterday?

277
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,571
Wow.
Apologize.

278
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,325
Sorry I kicked your ass in
front of your "thin" girlfriend.

279
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,660
How about we wait until next
year after you have your kid?

280
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,954
You know what?
Tiffany's going to college.

281
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,457
Listen, I don't know what
you guys are talking about,

282
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,169
but I guess I'll just accept your
apology so we can get on with our day.

283
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,505
God bless. A friend of
mine uses your paper.

284
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,757
You do good work.

285
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,217
Bye-bye.
Bye.

286
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,930
So, Toby, I think we should do
a different self-defense seminar,

287
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,474
how to protect ourselves
against tiny little girls.

288
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,727
There's no shame in
getting beaten up by a girl.

289
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,854
My ex-wife used
to demolish me.

290
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,481
No, there is
shame in it, okay?

291
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,274
We have to draw
the line somewhere.

292
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,693
Oh, my God, I think I see
the imprint of a Ring Pop.

293
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,111
Oh...

294
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,365
Have you seen Erin?

295
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,658
I'm on break.

296
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,870
Oh, my God.

297
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,830
No, hey, bloggers, where
do you think you're going?

298
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,290
No, you got to stay
for the big presentation.

299
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,708
We got this
young whiz kid, Ryan.

300
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,460
He's like an even
more handsome Bill Gates.

301
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,670
When's the presentation?

302
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,421
It's moments away!
Just stay here.

303
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,966
Hey, Uncle Lucas,
it's your nephew, Ryan.

304
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,135
Honestly, I could use a
prescription for Ritalin right now.

305
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,347
Well, I know you did
one for Aunt Carol.

306
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,767
So it's different
because it's your wife?

307
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,978
Well, that doesn't
make any sense to me.

308
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,771
How are you doing?
Don't talk to me right now.

309
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,314
I'm sorry.
I know you're my boss,

310
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,607
but seriously,
you need to get

311
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,067
the hell out of my face.

312
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:44,949
Your little man is
unraveling. Now go and fix it.

313
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,993
Sorry about
kicking you out.

314
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,329
It's just we don't want our
brand associated with death.

315
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:54,583
It's okay. I'll go to the Costco
and search for handsome men.

316
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,502
You're not married yet?

317
00:13:56,752 --> 00:14:00,506
Oh, I was. My husband
was my best friend.

318
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,299
He passed away.

319
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,429
My best friend
was my boss, Andy.

320
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,931
We dated for a while,
but since then,

321
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,017
he rejected me and
we're not really friends.

322
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:16,313
Someone rejected you? With
that body and those bazongas?

323
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,857
Forget him.

324
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,570
Yeah. Forget him! And you
should forget your husband.

325
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,155
Well...

326
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,199
How long has he
been in the bathroom?

327
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,409
Like 10 minutes.

328
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,202
Geez, what's he
doing in there?

329
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,537
Oh, that's my phone.

330
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,872
Am I allowed to answer it
or are you going to freak out?

331
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:33,956
Are there bloggers around?

332
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,624
It's Ryan.

333
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,252
“I'm sorry. I lied.
I'm not in the bathroom.

334
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,588
"I can't do it.
I need to see my mom.

335
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,797
“I'm going home."

336
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,966
What is the delay here?

337
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,385
Where is Ryan?

338
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,554
Why is he not here?

339
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,139
I had to send him home.

340
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,143
As brilliant and
creative as he is,

341
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,188
he is nothing
compared to this guy!

342
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,522
Uh...

343
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,066
What?

344
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,400
That's right. Will you
just give us a second?

345
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,444
You are going to bloody ruin
it. You're going to bloody ruin it

346
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,988
because you're a no-good,
half-assed, cockeyed numpty!

347
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,364
Okay. Okay.

348
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,825
Jim. I'm not doing
the presentation.

349
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:13,704
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at this face.

350
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,539
This is not
the face of a performer.

351
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,834
This is the face of a scary
apparition you see before you die.

352
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:24,965
I'm telling you, if you don't
do this, I don't stand a chance.

353
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,593
Please, Jim.

354
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,683
Okay, I'll do it.

355
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,855
Oh, my God. Okay!

356
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,732
Go get into Ryan's costume
and check out his notes.

357
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:42,858
A costume?

358
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,527
Of course
there's a costume.

359
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,488
Oh, this is going
to be great.

360
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,864
There's nothing like
some last minute changes

361
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,659
to really energize
a presentation. Huh?

362
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,132
Did you pass out in there?
What is taking so long?

363
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,925
I've been in here
for 20 seconds.

364
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,886
Hurry up! Let me in! I want
to watch you get dressed.

365
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,180
Did you find
the eyeliner?

366
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,141
I'm not wearing eyeliner.

367
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,351
You are wearing
eyeliner, Jim.

368
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:30,781
Time, space, gender.

369
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,408
There
are no rules anymore.

370
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,910
All boundaries
are breaking down

371
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,038
in the wake of
the infinite future.

372
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,668
The only thing that... The
only thing that remains...

373
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,170
The only thing
that remains

374
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,672
are the things that have
stood the test of time.

375
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:51,260
Love, values, and of
course, the Pyramids.

376
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,763
The strongest shape
ever constructed.

377
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:59,185
A shape that fits all
other shapes inside of it.

378
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,352
No, that's...

379
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,478
Mmm. It's true.

380
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:07,401
This is the future
because this is the past.

381
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,571
I've been through a
lot of issues in my life.

382
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:15,201
I've seen drug addiction,
unemployment.

383
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,662
I've been in a relationship
that tore my heart apart

384
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,625
without ever being able to
accept that love drove the pain.

385
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,627
Yep.

386
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,631
When I was 10 years old, my
parents took me to Disneyworld.

387
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,674
I cried the whole time.

388
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:36,305
I was not able to comprehend
the beauty that was before me.

389
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,725
I just wanted to go home.

390
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,562
This is what the
Pyramid will do for you.

391
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,982
It is the bridge
to the world.

392
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,984
It has the USB port.

393
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:53,280
Wireless will be
available in 2013.

394
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:59,662
You can play anything
from Chuck to Cars 2.

395
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:06,835
With the Pyramid, you have
the connection to everything.

396
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,464
In time and space.

397
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:15,970
Psst!

398
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,180
Oh.

399
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:26,230
<i>Sabre. It's time
to come home.</i>

400
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,245
All right.
Thank you so much. Wow!

401
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,122
Wow!

402
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,582
And good night!

403
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,043
Yeah!

404
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,301
Okay, this isn't over.
Let's stay focused, okay?

405
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,554
We made fun of Andy earlier
for getting beat up by a little girl,

406
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,223
but little things
can be dangerous.

407
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,393
Whether it's a gremlin
or Chucky the doll,

408
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,646
the key is to
throw it in something,

409
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,066
like a fireplace or
a tub of electricity.

410
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,277
Okay, good point. Um...

411
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,697
Good point? What
is a tub of electricity?

412
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,907
I don't know.
With all due respect,

413
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,659
we know what we're
defending against.

414
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,411
It's a 12-year-old
female bully.

415
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,829
I was a 12-year-old bully.

416
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,333
Great! I think Kelly
should attack Toby.

417
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,500
Yeah.

418
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,793
Yeah, that's not
a bad idea actually

419
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,920
because I have had
a lot of pent-up aggression.

420
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,547
- Thanks.
- Good! Go!

421
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,882
I don't know whether
this is gonna help.

422
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,258
All right, Kelly!

423
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,011
We should stay to maybe
some more traditional models.

424
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,429
You think
you're so pretty?

425
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,598
You're not going to be
so pretty come prom-time!

426
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,141
Okay, this is what's
called... Take that!

427
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,601
...pre-violent posture.
Take that!

428
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,895
Not so pre-violent
anymore!

429
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,647
I'm in what's called
the decision point.

430
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:51,982
Hey, hey, hey.
Kelly! Kelly!

431
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,776
Ow!

432
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,110
My good eye!

433
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,112
Oh, boy.

434
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,573
Oh, no, I'm not
laughing at you.

435
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,951
I'm laughing at
something that Cece did

436
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,663
on the playground earlier,
yesterday, this morning.

437
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,541
You know why I
got hit by girls?

438
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,920
Because I stood up
for others.

439
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,797
Pam and Toby.

440
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:20,219
I stepped in and I didn't care
that I was standing up to girls.

441
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:25,766
You may want to ask yourselves,
where were you when the girls came?

442
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,229
Tough day, yes.
But I feel good.

443
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,898
I put the office
in their place,

444
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:36,402
took a bunch of painkillers, drank
half a bottle of wine, took my pants off.

445
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,570
I just feel good.

446
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,242
Okay, okay, I will be
the first to admit it.

447
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,577
We could have integrated
more Chuck into the presentation.

448
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,497
Dwight, you're
the vice president.

449
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:54,670
Yeah!
Okay! Come on!

450
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,213
Right on!

451
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,173
Bam, bam, barn, bam, barn!

452
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,258
Boom!
