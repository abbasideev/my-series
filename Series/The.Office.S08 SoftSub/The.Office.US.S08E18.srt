1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:04,087
Okay. Bye.

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:11,511
Everyone, stop what you're
doing. I have terrible news.

3
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:13,555
Dwight is
no longer with us.

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:14,890
What?
What?

5
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:16,850
He's gone, damn it.

6
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,354
He's been promoted to
V.P. of Sabre Retail

7
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,731
and he's staying
in Florida forever.

8
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,525
So, he's alive?

9
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:29,029
Yeah. That was him on the
phone. He sounds wonderful.

10
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,615
Well, the way you said it
made it sound like he was dead.

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,783
How could I have
been more clear?

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,244
He had a massive
stroke of good fortune

13
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,455
and he is now in
a better place.

14
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,458
If Dwight's not coming back, does
that mean we can open his treasure?

15
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,670
You guys, we've gone over
this, there is no treasure.

16
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,589
When the team
left for Tallahassee,

17
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,258
Dwight told everyone
not to touch his treasure.

18
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,093
Don't touch my treasure.

19
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:53,887
Okay? You understand?

20
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,806
Obviously he wants us to obsess
about it. There's nothing in there.

21
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,269
Which is obviously what
he would want us to think,

22
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,980
making it the perfect
place to hide a treasure.

23
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,025
Oh, God, I'm Wallace
Shawn in The Princess Bride.

24
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,319
I think that Dwight
wanted us to realize

25
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,781
that this conversation among
friends is the true treasure.

26
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,574
No, no, no.

27
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,327
I am dying to
know what's in there.

28
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,247
Yeah, I know, Oscar. We all
are. But nobody's going to open it.

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,539
You'd have to be insane.

30
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,543
Hi. Hello.

31
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,383
Now carefully open the box.

32
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,639
It's a photo of all of us.

33
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,017
Oh, that's so sweet.

34
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,772
A dart?
Are you kidding me?

35
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,567
Who would put a poison dart... Well, I
mean, I don't know that it's poisoned.

36
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,070
I mean,
I just have to imagine.

37
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,614
God, I'm glad
he's okay though.

38
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:55,991
Kind of sounds
like he deserved it,

39
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,576
opening another man's
treasure and all. Wow!

40
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:25,020
Well, Mister Ball, it's been a
pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell!

41
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,525
All right!
Well swung by VIPVP.

42
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,403
I am loving the chemistry
between you two.

43
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,323
I am so happy Dwight is going
to be working alongside me.

44
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:40,285
We are a regular Archibald
and his man, George.

45
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,495
I bet. I'm excited.

46
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,666
Trick! There's no such thing.
It's not even a real English duo.

47
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,751
Ah!

48
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:52,714
I just made you look like the Goat of
Dover. And that doesn't exist either.

49
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,634
You think you're excited?
You should feel my nipples.

50
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,428
Pong!

51
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,098
Oh, that reminds me...
Little something from all of us.

52
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,560
Oh, my gosh. Thank you, Jim.
That's so thoughtful.

53
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,860
Fore! Oh, yeah!

54
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,987
He doesn't even care.

55
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,280
I don't even care!

56
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,449
This is the last time
I'll ever see Dwight.

57
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,202
It's a weird feeling.
It's, um...

58
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:27,457
What's the word?
It's not "bittersweet."

59
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,251
It's "sweet." Yeah.

60
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,505
Hey, man.
Selling cookies for Jada.

61
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,048
You want
the same as last year?

62
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,175
Would if I could
and I can so I will.

63
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,804
Put me down for one box. Don't
care what it is. Dealer's choice.

64
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,056
I'll put you down
for shortbreads.

65
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,557
Damn it.

66
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,185
Knock, knock. Hey.

67
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,645
It's Sasha's
first year in the troop

68
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,979
so I'm selling
cookies for her.

69
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,356
Anyway, would you
like some?

70
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,650
No. No.
What?

71
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,486
I've been selling here for
five years. This is my spot.

72
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,782
You can't claim territories. This is
the only place I interact with people.

73
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,160
Why can't you sell it
at your church or barbershop?

74
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,331
Or chess club?

75
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,460
You know what? It's your
first time, we'll split the office.

76
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:17,090
You can have Sales, the
Annex, Creed, and I don't know.

77
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,300
I'll just take Accounting.

78
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,513
That's it?
Yeah. Well, okay.

79
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,890
Thanks, Darryl.
Okay, great.

80
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,018
All I need is Kevin.

81
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,479
Dude buys more cookies
than everyone combined.

82
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:32,772
And then some.

83
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,025
When I first started selling
cookies, he was a relatively thin man.

84
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,737
Not a thin man, mind you.
Relatively thin.

85
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,742
Hey,
Lucy, I'm home! Babaloo.

86
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,244
Here, let me help.

87
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:50,999
I got it. It was so busy at the store
today. Really good cheese nibbles.

88
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,125
I had like a hundred.

89
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,127
Irene hired me as
her live-in helper.

90
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,045
We met at
the store launch.

91
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,798
I told her I was moving here
and I needed a place

92
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,550
and it just
sort of made sense.

93
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,260
I basically do
everything for her.

94
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,679
I run errands, I do
chores around the house.

95
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,097
I cook and clean.

96
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,892
Honestly, I don't know
how she survived without me.

97
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:14,689
When can I introduce you to my
grandson? He's a wonderful swimmer.

98
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,484
Shallow end, deep end.
He does it all.

99
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,986
Well, today might be
kind of tough, Irene.

100
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,654
I have to talk to
my old boss, Andy,

101
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,239
and tell him I'm
staying in Florida.

102
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,080
Oh! What kind
of tea is this?

103
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,916
Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.

104
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,922
Oh!
Oh!

105
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:44,260
In England, they put the holes
a little bit to the right, you see.

106
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,929
We'll just chalk it up
to cultural bias.

107
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,138
If I may.

108
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:54,395
Try holding the putter, you
know, with your wrists here,

109
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,731
and your thumbs here.

110
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,274
Oh.

111
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,985
That's right.
Your little finger.

112
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,446
Would you like to
buy some cookies?

113
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,324
Cookies, eh?

114
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,617
Mmm-hmm.
Hmm.

115
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,037
Oh, the spring
time thinks that it's the best

116
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,915
And fall time
thinks that it's the best

117
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,709
Cold time has
kind of a strut

118
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,671
And Valentine's
thinks that it's the best

119
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,549
But gather round, peeps
I'll tell you the truth

120
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,426
Nothing beats the cookie
season That's the truth

121
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,559
It's not
a scratch and sniff, Kev.

122
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,520
I know. But sometimes
you still get a little something.

123
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,064
Hey, you tricked me.
You just wanted Kevin.

124
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,733
You're new to the game.
You learned a lesson today.

125
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,110
See you next year, sport.

126
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,154
No, no, no, that's not fair. What if
Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?

127
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,698
See?
I do.

128
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,410
That doesn't mean anything. Kevin,
do you want to buy cookies from me?

129
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,078
Oh, I definitely do.

130
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,038
Huh. Hit the road, Jack.

131
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,957
No, you hit the road, Jack.

132
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,836
Hey, guys, come on.
Don't fight over me.

133
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,005
Why don't we split the order?
It's only fair.

134
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,133
No, wait, no. I'm
buying. I make the rules.

135
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,052
I actually do want
you to fight over me.

136
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:12,432
I want to be wined and
dined and sixty-nined.

137
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,808
Ugh!

138
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,938
Metaphorically sixty-nined.
Ew! Perverts.

139
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,399
No offense, Oscar.

140
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,196
Hop in! We have places to
be! No rest for the wicked.

141
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:31,284
All right,
so I guess this is it.

142
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,038
Well, Jim, I just want to say that
we haven't always gotten along.

143
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,290
And, at times, I've even
hated your guts, but...

144
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,879
Bye, bye. I win.

145
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:45,965
Good-bye, Dwight.

146
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,385
Robert! Race you to the
clubhouse! Gentleman's bet!

147
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,720
Whoo-hoo!

148
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,186
Well, he's
Florida's problem now.

149
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,521
Oh, let Dwight
have his fun.

150
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,774
Today will not be his day.

151
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:03,941
What's that?

152
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,485
I'm going to
tank the Sabre store

153
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,819
at the presentation
to the board.

154
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,154
I thought you
liked the store.

155
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,323
No, the store is lovely.

156
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:14,702
You created a wonderful space
to showcase our product line.

157
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,245
Great job. Cheers.

158
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,581
Thank you.

159
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:24,337
But there's a reason we sell our
products online and over the phone.

160
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,256
Have you ever used
Sabre electronics, Jim?

161
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,550
They're cheap,
they're unintuitive.

162
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,177
The Sabre store
would work

163
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,804
if we adopted
the carnival model

164
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,764
of leaving town once
everyone's wise to us.

165
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,935
Wow. When you put it that way, I
guess it does sound pretty terrible.

166
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,939
I couldn't just Kill the project from
the start. Jo Bennett endorsed it.

167
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,525
Shame, though.
I did like Dwight.

168
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:51,114
Robert, I'm going to win!
Ha-ha! I'm the gentleman! Suck it!

169
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,574
Bravo, Dwight!
Very good!

170
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,120
Shame.

171
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,957
The math is simple, folks!

172
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:05,837
Deeper market penetration plus
greater visibility will raise Sabre...

173
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,840
To the power of two.
To the power of two.

174
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,260
How did that look?

175
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,344
I'm not just
saying this,

176
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,763
that was the best
thing I've ever seen.

177
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,640
Told you.

178
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,851
When you guys do that
whole "power of two" shebang,

179
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,769
how about I pop up also?

180
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,772
I guess we'd have to
say "power of three."

181
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,817
Actually you know what?
Yeah, that actually works.

182
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,569
You'd spin off right,
I'd spin off...

183
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,028
You know what?
That is a great idea.

184
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,530
Cathy, write that down
and print it out.

185
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,906
It's going to make some
really good toilet paper.

186
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,783
All right.
There he is.

187
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,493
What are you doing here?
I thought I got rid of you.

188
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,162
Can I just talk to you
for one quick second?

189
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,664
What? Your stylist
ran out of messy spray?

190
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,918
Um, actually, it's for your
own good. I think we should...

191
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,253
You want to do
something for my own good?

192
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,588
Turn around,
walk out that door.

193
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,922
Do not stop until
you get to Scranton.

194
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,675
Find my cell phone charger, mail
it back to me and then go to hell.

195
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,891
Nice. Hey, Halpert, anyone ever
tell you, you look like Wooly Willy?

196
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,809
Silence.

197
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,561
I'm just trying to...

198
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,271
I know what
you're trying to do.

199
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,023
I don't want it.

200
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,651
But your face does look
like the guy from Operation.

201
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,072
It's the same guy.
That's the joke I made.

202
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,532
Different guy.
You know what...

203
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,700
I just think
you should know...

204
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,036
That you look like
the world's tallest hobbit.

205
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,585
Well, I tried. You saw it.
So, it's on the record.

206
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,086
I have a plane to catch.

207
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,633
Can you help me? I'm trying
to make a video chat with Andy.

208
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,968
Just open the program
and type in his username.

209
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,470
Can you just do it?

210
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,060
You type in your password.

211
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,021
Erin, one, two, three.

212
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,148
That's a terrible password.

213
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,817
And you don't
make a video chat.

214
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,068
You video chat.
All right.

215
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,075
Hello.

216
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,536
That's so weird. There's
something wrong with my laptop.

217
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,830
Oh.

218
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:04,914
I fixed it.

219
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,752
Now mine's broken.
Hang on.

220
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,174
Oh, there we go.

221
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,846
He said "I did like
Dwight"? He's going to fire him.

222
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,305
No, no, no,
I think it was more like,

223
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,140
"I liked him,
but I don't anymore

224
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,685
"because he did a bad job, so
I'm definitely going to yell at him."

225
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,853
Robert doesn't
talk like that.

226
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,437
You have to stop Dwight
from doing this.

227
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,481
I tried.
He will not listen.

228
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,108
Did you actually
try your hardest?

229
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,111
Yes. My pretty hardest.

230
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,780
Look, you haven't dealt
with him in a while, all right?

231
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:38,948
He's like Super Dwight.

232
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,577
It's like he's been bitten by a
radioactive Dwight or something.

233
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,744
Stanley, back me up.

234
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,954
Don't talk to me.

235
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,789
Stanley's very upset
that we're leaving Florida,

236
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,249
but he would back me up.

237
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,419
If Dwight's about to get
fired, you have to tell him.

238
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,629
Just get the words out,
that's all you can do.

239
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,756
Okay. All right.

240
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,260
What's a skinny guy like Toby
know about cookies?

241
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,553
You can't trust
him to understand

242
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,722
the wants and needs
of the thick man.

243
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,307
Maybe Toby from
two years ago.

244
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,725
Yeah.
That's true.

245
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,977
If I have a question about
my cookies at midnight,

246
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,312
who am I going to call?

247
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,274
Darryl. Toby's probably
in bed with some model.

248
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,525
Thank you.

249
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,235
I'm not going to comment
on my personal life.

250
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,448
Look, I need this. Okay, your
daughter is a pretty little girl.

251
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,325
Let her go door to door.

252
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:26,746
You think people are going to buy
cookies from my chubby daughter?

253
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,164
Ooh.

254
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,084
Baby, if you're watching this,
you're not chubby. You're beautiful.

255
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,337
Daddy's just got to
sell some cookies.

256
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,758
And we're also going to
exercise more. It's going to be fun.

257
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,177
Oh. You know what you
have to do to decide?

258
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,429
You need to make them do
things for you and buy you things.

259
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,183
Or have them sing that song
that the frog does in Looney Tunes.

260
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,726
Make them kiss each other.

261
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,811
Make them kiss me.

262
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,855
Ew!

263
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,817
Yes, this is, too, tan.

264
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,653
This right here.
No.

265
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,947
This is a tan spot.

266
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,659
I don't buy it. And that is a
freckle. That is not a tan, okay?

267
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,203
I'm going to have to inspect it in
person when you get back here.

268
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:11,666
I want you looking totally
Puertorriqueia when I see you.

269
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,418
Well, Andy,
I'm not coming back.

270
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,462
What?

271
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,757
I have a job here.
I work for an old lady.

272
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:21,676
Hello.

273
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:23,928
Andy?

274
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,139
Yeah, that's awesome.
That's great.

275
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,186
Oh, baby, telephone

276
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:37,650
And tell me I'm your own

277
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,987
Okay, this is tough
because Darryl,

278
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,364
you sang better and
you danced better,

279
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,951
but Toby has that indescribable
quality that makes a star.

280
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,247
I think I've
reached my decision.

281
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,043
I've decided that you guys are
going to keep doing things for me.

282
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,963
No, no, no, no.
It's not worth it.

283
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,172
No.

284
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,591
No, it's not worth it?
That's too bad.

285
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,261
Because I was feeling
particularly hungry this year.

286
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,638
Yeah, okay, so what?
You buy 40 boxes?

287
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,306
Hungrier.

288
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,142
507

289
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,185
Hungrier.

290
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,731
You're not
talking triple digits?

291
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,983
Oh, yeah,
I'm talking triple digits.

292
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:23,446
Again.

293
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,699
Hello,
ma baby Hello, ma honey

294
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,993
Hello, ma ragtime gal

295
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,871
It's show time.

296
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:32,955
Dwight!

297
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,000
You again? Gosh, I keep throwing
you away, you keep flying back.

298
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,585
You're like
an Amish return stick.

299
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,211
Okay, great, listen,
listen to me.

300
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,629
No, no, no, no.

301
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,131
Will you just let me
tell you one thing, please?

302
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,674
Yes, you may tell
me one thing. Great.

303
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,134
Wait, do you want to
borrow money? Listen to me.

304
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,969
Robert is going to
veto the Sabre store.

305
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,095
Jim, come on.

306
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,889
Dwight, he's going to
kill the store. Mmm-hmm.

307
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,141
And then I'm pretty sure
he's going to fire you for it.

308
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:56,645
Wait, he's going to kill the
store and he's going to fire me?

309
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,813
Yes.

310
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,190
That's two things.

311
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,900
Dwight, please.
Nice try, Jim.

312
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,234
Your pranks have
never worked in the past

313
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,736
and they're not
going to work today.

314
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,945
Okay, first of all,
they've mostly worked so...

315
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,739
You know what? You might
want to get to the airport.

316
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,532
It's going to take you a long
time to get through security

317
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,993
with all those
beauty products. Bye.

318
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,495
Dwight, come on.

319
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,082
Nothing is going to stop me.
That is the mark of a great man.

320
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,042
Unstoppability.

321
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:24,006
Dunder Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all
those things vanish in my rearview mirror.

322
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,761
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I have a date with destiny.

323
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,721
And from what I hear
she's a...

324
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,644
Help! Help!

325
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,314
Gross, don't lick my hand.
God, why is there so much saliva?

326
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,607
All I had to do
was think about pie

327
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,858
and my salivary glands
did the rest.

328
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,276
Gross! What? What?
What? What?

329
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,570
Oh, God, Jim!
Oh! My appendix!

330
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,696
I'm sorry.

331
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,490
My wound hasn't healed
yet. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

332
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,117
Oh, man. I'm so sorry. I forgot.

333
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,077
Are you all right?
Are you okay?

334
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,126
Where the hell is he?
I cannot do this without him.

335
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,418
I don't know.
He's not picking up.

336
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,799
Looks like
Shnoot's a no-show.

337
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,802
Guess he wasn't vice
prezzy material after all.

338
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,137
But I am.

339
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,721
Put me in, babe.

340
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,433
I've got the info down backwards,
forwards, and doggy style.

341
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,560
I'm your man.

342
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,564
Right.
Let's begin then.

343
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,525
Ladies and gentlemen,
allow me to introduce

344
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:29,155
the vice president of Sabre
Retail, Mister Todd Packer.

345
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,907
What's up?

346
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,168
What are you doing?

347
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,503
I'm just dealing
with Erin's stuff

348
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,338
since apparently
she's not coming back

349
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,631
and she didn't
bother to tell anyone.

350
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,550
We knew.
Ryan told us.

351
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,595
Ryan, why didn't you
tell me?

352
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,971
Thought you
checked my Tumblr.

353
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,931
You never update it.

354
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,516
Well, I updated it.

355
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,187
Does anyone else
think this is weird?

356
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,439
Like, kind of
uncool, actually?

357
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,815
To leave us without
a receptionist?

358
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,859
We'll find
another receptionist.

359
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,777
I mean, that's easy.
We'll be fine.

360
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,868
What are you doing?
I'm just trying to...

361
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,077
Get up. Get up.

362
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,537
Okay. Okay.

363
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:19,955
All right? I'm not
going to let you by.

364
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,209
Then you know what? I'm going
to just have to run right through you.

365
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,502
Okay.
What are you doing?

366
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,963
Are you really revving up?
You know that doesn't work.

367
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,132
Jackie Chan!

368
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,428
Go.

369
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,888
Hi, this is Alex.

370
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,973
And this is Sam.

371
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:42,144
"Kevin can't come to the phone
right now because he's busy with us."

372
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,520
Perfect.

373
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,190
Now people will think
I'm doing hot girls all day.

374
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,651
I don't know, man. They
might think we're drag queens.

375
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,362
Yeah, I don't know why you picked
names that were also guys' names.

376
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,906
Okay, now who do I ride
to the kitchen like a pony?

377
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,491
Don't make me be
your pony, Kevin.

378
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,159
Forget it, man.

379
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,162
What do you mean?
I'm out. So is Toby.

380
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,289
This may be wrong,
but there's a limit

381
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,041
to what I will do
for my child.

382
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,001
Yeah.
I have my dignity, too.

383
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,296
I refuse to be
another man's horsey.

384
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,509
No, guys, stop! You
have to sell me cookies!

385
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,469
I'll do anything.

386
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,889
Hello, my
baby Hello, my honey

387
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,432
I'm even going
to kiss Meredith.

388
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,022
Mmm!

389
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,191
That's so good.

390
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,779
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no!

391
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,990
This ends now!
This is dangerous.

392
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,574
Thunder slam!

393
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,201
No!

394
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,208
Anything else you
need to talk about?

395
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,294
Nope. That was it.

396
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,595
Once again,
it's show time.

397
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:06,145
What baffles me is how you
could take a perfectly good idea,

398
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,565
which the great Jo Bennett
rightfully signed off on

399
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,401
and then, utterly
botch it in execution.

400
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,737
If I may speak to that,

401
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,572
I have only
been vice president

402
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,324
of this project for
the last half-hour,

403
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,576
so the man you want
is Dwight Schrute.

404
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,536
I don't see Dwight.

405
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,079
He clearly had
the infinite wisdom

406
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,416
to stay as far away from
this clown show as possible.

407
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:32,880
Whatever you do,
do not blame Todd Packer.

408
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,424
It is not his fault.

409
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,094
Blame his upbringing.
His parents.

410
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,681
The society that would
mold this idiotic creature.

411
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,767
Fire the employee, yes.

412
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,727
But not the man.

413
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,189
You may not
cancel his soul.

414
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,774
That was never
on the table.

415
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,609
Are you kidding?

416
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,986
She's the queen of the
whole frigging magilla.

417
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,697
And yet, Todd,
it's you who's fired.

418
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,159
Wait, I can't get
fired. I'm an institution.

419
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,161
I have been at this
company for 20 years.

420
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,996
How many of you have
been here that long? Huh?

421
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,978
Hey, hey, they're back.

422
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,816
Hi! Oh, my
gosh! Look at you guys.

423
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,942
Dwight, what are you
doing here?

424
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,443
I thought you were
supposed to be in Florida.

425
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,862
Yeah, the crazy thing
about that is, um...

426
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,156
Wow, you look great.
Did you lose some weight?

427
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,201
Thank you. For someone
who actually noticed this,

428
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,745
no, I didn't lose weight,
but I started using my makeup

429
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,080
to contour my face
to look skinnier.

430
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,498
I actually put on
five pounds.

431
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,501
Hey, good to
have you back.

432
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,919
Good to be back.

433
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,048
Hey, stranger.

434
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,134
Oh, I missed you.
I missed you.

435
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,180
Oh!

436
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,435
I'm going to Florida
to get Erin.

437
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,152
Forgot to turn off my email.
It's crazy, right?

438
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,445
It's just when she
said she was leaving,

439
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,905
I felt all... "You're
about to close four tabs,

440
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,073
"are you sure you
want to continue?"

441
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,658
Yes, I am sure.

442
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,370
Ah! Slow computer.
