1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,003
Ho-ho!

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:05,255
Look who's back reporting
for duty. Hey, guys.

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,257
Hi.

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,925
Pam! Hal

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,886
Look what I can do now
that she's no longer pregnant!

6
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,345
Bam! Bam! Bam! Pam!

7
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,930
Are you glad
to be back?

8
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,058
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I could
have used another week, or three.

9
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,269
You still had eight
weeks more than we did.

10
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,771
Well, it's not
exactly a vacation.

11
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:25,317
Hello, everyone!
Remember? Little old me. Hi.

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,235
What are you doing here?
You just had our baby.

13
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:32,616
Our collective Dunder Mifflin
family baby four days ago.

14
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,201
I wanted to come
back to work.

15
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:38,580
Not everybody needs some long,
luxurious, Parisian maternity leave.

16
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,999
Damn, girl! Your body!
What?

17
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,876
Angela, you
look amazing.

18
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,504
Really? I feel like
this big rhinoceros.

19
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:50,467
Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for
covering for me, so I made some treats.

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,385
I've got brownies
and magic cookie bars.

21
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,970
Mm-mm-mm.

22
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:58,683
Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them
and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts.

23
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,310
You're allergic to
walnuts, right, Kevin?

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,646
Extremely, but I'm going
to fight through it.

25
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,690
It's okay, Angela.
I have mommy brain, too.

26
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,442
I don't know
what that is, Pam.

27
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,153
I made a batch with no nuts,
special for you, Kevin. Right here.

28
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,030
When did you find time
to do all this?

29
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,324
Babies sleep a lot, Pam,
if you feed them enough.

30
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,993
Brownie, Pam?

31
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,208
Thank you.

32
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,170
Oh, my gosh.
It's really good.

33
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,547
I wouldn't know.
I'm watching my weight.

34
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,763
Say, guys, you know what's an
even more useful treat is cash. So...

35
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,683
Nope. It's over. No. Okay.
We wanted to say thank you...

36
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,361
Dwight, I have exciting
news for you. What?

37
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,239
I think you're
going to like it.

38
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,657
You can't tantalize me.

39
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,034
Oh, maybe I can.

40
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,287
I got an e-mail
from corporate

41
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,414
that told me...
Okay.

42
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,457
...that you got
a promotion!

43
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,837
Right? I mean, that's not the kind of thing
you want to read quietly at your desk.

44
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,256
If you make me head of
sales one more time, I swear.

45
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,340
No. This is legit.

46
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:16,136
You will be assembling a team to
go to Tallahassee for three weeks

47
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,723
to develop and launch
a chain of Sabre stores.

48
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,268
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,562
Yes! Yes! Yes!

50
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,566
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

51
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,443
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

52
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,819
The Schrutes
have a word for when

53
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,989
everything in a man's life
comes together perfectly.

54
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,991
"Perfektenschlag."

55
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,826
Right now, I'm in it.

56
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,120
I finally get a chance to
prove myself to corporate.

57
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,415
I am assembling a competent
team. I am likely a father.

58
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:50,378
I am so deep inside of
perfektenschlag right now.

59
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,340
And just to be clear,
there is a second definition,

60
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,842
"perfect pork anus,"
which I don't mean.

61
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,219
And here's
the fax for you.

62
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,513
And here's
some facts for you.

63
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,099
Did you know frogs can
hear with their lungs?

64
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,936
And that flamingos can have
orgasms that last 30 minutes.

65
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,774
Love to learn. Yeah, it's
weird that I said that last one.

66
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,609
So...

67
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,861
Yeah, look at that.
We're pin twins.

68
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,279
Pin twins.

69
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,865
This is a gift from Jessica.
Kind of a gag gift, really.

70
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:19,991
Real gifts come later.

71
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,327
Yeah. That's cute.

72
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,080
When I saw it at CVS,
it made me gag, too. Just...

73
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,547
For a while there, I thought
something would change, but nope.

74
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,882
Andy's still with Jessica.

75
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,051
They even carpool
together most days.

76
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,511
I don't know.

77
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,555
I wouldn't mind carpooling
every day with Andy,

78
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,266
but I wouldn't want to spend
that much time with Jessica.

79
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,937
What do we have here?

80
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,818
Val knit me a beanie.

81
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,986
But I can't tell if it's a
"We're just friends" beanie,

82
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,031
or a "I'm hot, you're hot,
let's get it popping" beanie.

83
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,951
So I'm going
to up the ante.

84
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,662
Give her a clearly
romantic gift.

85
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,331
And we'll get to the
meaning of the beanie.

86
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,084
Pam, pack up your
post-natal swimwear,

87
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,794
make it a one piece or
this offer is rescinded,

88
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:16,756
and join me for a fantastic barbeque one
week from today in Tallahassee, Florida,

89
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,633
where I'm going to be living
for the next three weeks.

90
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,593
Really?
Mm-hmm.

91
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,429
I'll fly anywhere
for some good barbeque.

92
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,513
Ooh, me three.

93
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,517
No plus ones.
This is for competent workers only.

94
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,145
And don't worry about the
cost. Sabre is footing the bill.

95
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,605
Does this have anything to do with
what you were talking to Andy about?

96
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,065
God, you're
such a spy.

97
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,696
Notice anything
different about me?

98
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,823
You're wearing the
beanie. You like it?

99
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,659
Super comfortable. Like
sweatpants for my head.

100
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,411
I love it too, Val.

101
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,704
It's really itchy,

102
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,374
uh, but to be fair, my
head is constantly itching,

103
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,043
so I can't really
peg it on the hat.

104
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,214
Wow. It's like the Nation
of Islam down here.

105
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,800
I like to knit,
don't hate.

106
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,386
Who's that for?

107
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,141
Oh. This is a gift for
my man Nate here.

108
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,434
What?
Yeah.

109
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,852
Darryl, you
shouldn't have.

110
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,481
Can I open it? No, no,
no, maybe just later.

111
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,733
Ah, I can't wait. I'm
sorry. I'm too excited.

112
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,655
Darryl.

113
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,532
Wow. Those
are really nice.

114
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,284
They're so elegant.

115
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,244
Cashmere.
How did you know?

116
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,246
Just a hunch.

117
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,749
Your gift is on the way.

118
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,083
Can't wait.

119
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,338
“I'm glad you're in my life.
Happy Valentine's Day."

120
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:42,091
Darryl, I am glad
to be in your life, too.

121
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,262
Your card is more
beautiful than the gloves.

122
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,018
My first task as special
project manager Dwight Schrute,

123
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,978
assembling a crack team.

124
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,814
I need people who are loyal,

125
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,944
people who will help me get an
inroad with the gay Hispanic community.

126
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,196
People who won't be missed.

127
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,324
We don't need idiots.

128
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,035
Good for nothings.

129
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,954
Meth heads.

130
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,456
Or...

131
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:14,958
What's your name?

132
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,168
Cathy.
Cathy.

133
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,842
I just got a text from
Robert California that says,

134
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,469
"Bring your clubs
to Florida."

135
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,805
Why? Does he think you're
going to Florida?

136
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,516
I hope not. Because
I am not going.

137
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,726
Two question marks?

138
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,397
No, just do one. Two question
marks is kind of aggressive.

139
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,274
You know, it's like,
"Well, what?"

140
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,276
Just do one.

141
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,988
You want to take Darryl,
Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?

142
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,072
Yes.

143
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,616
Can I interest you
in someone less essential?

144
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,994
Like a Creed or a
Meredith, perhaps?

145
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,162
Oh, my God. They're
not expendable exactly.

146
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,748
I just can't... I can't think
of the word I'm trying to find.

147
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,000
Are you kidding me?

148
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,960
I'm supposed to get on an
airplane with those nincompoops?

149
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,128
We'd never make it
off the runway!

150
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,631
All right, look, I got to keep
this office functioning somehow,

151
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,384
so I have put
together a list.

152
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,927
Here's your team.

153
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,554
Darryl and Phyllis,
you can have.

154
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,015
You're also taking Cathy,
Kelly and Kevin.

155
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,183
Oh, God.
You have your team.

156
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,687
Kevin? Kelly? Cathy?

157
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,148
Andy just gave me a
chain with three weak links.

158
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,318
Have you ever tried to use a
chain with three weak links? I have.

159
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,862
And now I no longer
own an Arctic Wolf.

160
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,157
Well, let's hear it.

161
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,951
"Robert, hey," exclamation
point. I like it so far.

162
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,620
"Got your text.
Awesome idea.

163
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:37,081
"Let's hit the links the next time you're in PA.
-J.H."

164
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,045
It's perfect. You emphasize the
golf, completely omit the Florida.

165
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,379
Yeah, it's a golf text.

166
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,423
Total golf text. Send it.

167
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:50,470
Done. Wait, I just feel
weird. I should just call him.

168
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,641
You want to call someone that texted you?
Do you want to drive them away? I mean...

169
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,604
This is Darryl.

170
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,981
Sorry, I asked for
the main shipment number.

171
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,608
I just need the address
for the warehouse.

172
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,276
I want to send my
girlfriend some flowers.

173
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,072
Your girlfriend?
Is your girlfriend Val?

174
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,074
Yeah. Do you know her?

175
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:15,161
We're friends.
We're friends.

176
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,831
Cool. So can I get
that address or...

177
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:22,168
Yeah, yeah. Sorry, I'm
just looking for a pen.

178
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,294
Why do you
need a pen?

179
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,213
Back off.
I got my reasons.

180
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,173
May I have your
attention, please?

181
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,008
Could Cathy, Phyllis,
Darryl, Kevin and Kelly

182
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,094
please join me in the
conference room immediately?

183
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,637
Why?
No big deal.

184
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,932
It's just that you five have been
deemed most deserving of a three-week,

185
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,434
all expenses paid business
trip to Tallahassee, Florida.

186
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,561
Hell, yeah.
What?

187
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,856
I'm sorry, Stanley. I can't
share any more details with you.

188
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,025
You see,
Andy rejected you.

189
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,111
Wait,
Cathy gets to go?

190
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,405
Why does she even still
work here? Pam is back.

191
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,864
It just feels like
a slap in the face.

192
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,700
I can understand your
pain. And your rage.

193
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,952
But you know what?
Andy is an honorable man.

194
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,247
Let us not question his choices.
I'm sure he had his reasons.

195
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,791
We're not questioning his reasons.
I just want to know what they are.

196
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,126
I know. You and me
both, brother.

197
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,377
It seemed kind
of random to me,

198
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,339
but he was pretty clear on who he thought
truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.

199
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:13,094
Well, he nailed it, because
I do deserve a vacation.

200
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,555
Sometimes Batman's
got to take off his cape.

201
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,850
Good point. But we're going to be
working pretty hard until 5:00 p.m.

202
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,812
After that, it's going to be beach
volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral

203
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,814
and sea kayaking
with Gloria Estefan.

204
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,566
What were the
criteria for going?

205
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,986
It might be innate goodness
versus innate badness.

206
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,155
But there's an easy
way to find out.

207
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,993
Oh, Andy, got a few
questions for you.

208
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,662
Moshi moshi.

209
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,373
Uh, the Florida
picks got out,

210
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,418
and people were just kind of
curious as to why they weren't picked,

211
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,420
and maybe you
could just clarify.

212
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,504
Uh...

213
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:55,094
Well, the deliberations were confidential,
so I feel like we should respect that.

214
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,054
Respect it? You're
trying to tell me

215
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,348
Kevin Malone deserves more
than Stanley Hudson?

216
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,601
Hey.
Okay, it's obvious

217
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,937
that Andy picked the people that
are least important to the office.

218
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,607
Important? Because you and
your enormous monster baby

219
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,775
are so important
to the branch?

220
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,693
My baby is
not a monster.

221
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,154
Hey, be proud of your
enormous monster baby.

222
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,947
I was once an
enormous monster baby.

223
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,326
Guys! Guys! Guys!

224
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:23,414
Come on, seriously, we cannot let
this trip cause this kind of rift, guys.

225
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,791
Stop calling us "guys"!

226
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,878
I use the word "guys" a lot
when I'm nervous, guys.

227
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,172
- Guys, guys, guys. Guys.
- Stop it.

228
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,132
Stop! Stop it! Andy.

229
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,593
Dudes.

230
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:39,972
The dudes who are going to Florida
were picked by Dwight and me.

231
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,974
Okay, hey, I
specifically remember

232
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,268
that there were a lot of other
people I thought should be considered.

233
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,394
Uh...

234
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,396
If anybody's going to
Florida, it should be me.

235
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,650
Every shirt that I have that isn't
a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama.

236
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,402
I'm the only person in this
office who watches Burn Notice.

237
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,656
Okay. I did not realize that so
many of you wanted to go so badly,

238
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,826
so if you feel like you have a
very good reason to go to Florida,

239
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,410
I'm happy to hear you out.
Great idea.

240
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,496
So why doesn't everyone just
take the next five to six hours,

241
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,957
come up with a statement on why
you feel you deserve to go to Florida,

242
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,041
and Andy and I
will listen to it.

243
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,794
No, that is a ridiculous
waste of time. For you maybe.

244
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,712
Five to six hours?
Three to four hours.

245
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,006
No, no, no, no. No.
Just two to three hours.

246
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,509
Come up with a statement
over the next hour.

247
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,593
Thirty minutes.

248
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,428
I'm out.

249
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,972
Okay, read it
back to me.

250
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,516
"Robert, great offer. Wish I could
hit the links with you in Florida,

251
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,769
"but a father of a newborn really should be
helping out his wife any chance he gets."

252
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,398
Good. Doesn't sound pushy.
You're just stating a fact.

253
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,441
Absolutely.
Works for me.

254
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,069
Okay. Sending.

255
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,572
Well done. And we managed
to kill the entire morning.

256
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,282
We really did.

257
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,956
He responded, "L.O.L."

258
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,551
I have a new swimsuit I
need to break in. I am already...

259
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:02,346
I already picked my team,
Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby.

260
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,307
And that is the team
that I am taking.

261
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,727
What's that? It's not up to
me? I only have influence?

262
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,605
Well, that's all
Baltzer Glattfuelder had,

263
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,357
and now no one eats
owls for Thanksgiving.

264
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,027
You have two young,
dynamic people in this office

265
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,820
who know trends,
who know youth.

266
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,907
That's myself and Kelly
Kapoor, you need one of us there.

267
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,827
Or both? Not both. Just one. Me.

268
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,371
Or if not me, Kelly.
Ideally me.

269
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,789
Again, youth knowledge,

270
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,500
that's what you get when you put Ryan
Howard on your special project team.

271
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,171
Or Kelly Kapoor.
Again, not both. Thanks.

272
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,132
Very impressive.

273
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,676
He put a lot of work
into that. Mm-hmm.

274
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,762
PowerPoints are the peacocks
of the business world.

275
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,388
All show, no meat.

276
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,601
Because I feel like that I am in
a place with my gambling rehab

277
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:52,021
that I can finally start
going to dog racing again.

278
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:57,109
You know, just sitting,
watching, enjoying the sport.

279
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:01,447
Maybe putting down a few dollars if
there's like a crazy mismatch or something.

280
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,616
Okay. Thank you,
Kevin, we'll let you know.

281
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,368
Thank you.
When do we leave?

282
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,036
Thank you.

283
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,373
It really has been
a long, lonely winter.

284
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:14,418
Wow. Seasonal affective
disorder, a.k.a. SAD.

285
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,879
That sounds like
a very real thing, Toby.

286
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,715
It is real. Thank you
for saying that.

287
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,593
Yeah, wow,
it's almost like

288
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:26,639
we're not all experiencing
the same winter.

289
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:30,393
Florida Stanley smiles. Florida
Stanley is happy to go to work.

290
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,229
Florida Stanley is who you
want on your Florida team.

291
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,942
It's still... Well.
...she does here.

292
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,902
Hey, guys.
Any spots left?

293
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,904
Erin, you want to go
to Tallahassee?

294
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,990
I do. I really do.

295
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,200
I think it would be a nice
way to clear my head.

296
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,745
You know, I don't think it's a
good idea for you to clear your head

297
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,664
any more than it
has been already.

298
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,416
I think you need
a workplace where

299
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,961
the burdens of everyday life
keep you tethered to reality.

300
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,462
Either or.

301
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,215
But if you can find someone
to fill in, I would love to go.

302
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,426
Well, it wouldn't be hard
to find someone to fill in.

303
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,805
Really? Oh, great. Good.

304
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,100
Now, is it too dark to say that
Cece's having an operation?

305
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,102
I think you need
to go to Florida.

306
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,312
I think you're right.

307
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,690
It's only for three weeks.

308
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,859
You know, with my mom and
sister at the house, it'll be...

309
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:20,985
A total nightmare.

310
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,071
I was going to say good,
because I'll have all the help I need.

311
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,740
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
They're incredibly helpful.

312
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,074
You're lucky
to have them.

313
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,743
With them there, you probably
won't even know I'm gone.

314
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,077
Exactly.

315
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,789
Well...

316
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:39,128
No. No! Absolutely not. You are not
going! Over my dead body, no. Andy...

317
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,422
Toons, I'm really sorry.

318
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,716
You're too essential to the
operation here. I can't let you go.

319
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,260
I wouldn't say that.
That's a bit much.

320
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,678
You know, Dwight, if
you didn't want me to go,

321
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,848
the smart move would be to tell Andy that
I actually am essential to the operation.

322
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,099
That way, I couldn't go.

323
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,394
Jim is essential... Hold on. I
just want to get it on camera.

324
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,941
Andy, Jim is just too...

325
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,151
Essential.

326
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:03,944
This is stupid! Cut!

327
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,321
All right. I'm going
to pack my trunks.

328
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,447
He doesn't even
want to go.

329
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,948
Well, I got a text
from R.C.

330
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,619
inviting me to come down, so I think
that's going to make us roommates.

331
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,871
Oh, my God.

332
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,083
Hey, quick question, do you shower at
night? Or do you shower in the morning?

333
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,668
Because I want to shower when
you're showering to save some water.

334
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,673
Okay, listen up, everyone.
Here's who's going to Florida.

335
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,383
Cathy.
What?

336
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,593
Stanley.
No.

337
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,803
Ryan.
No!

338
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,012
Erin.

339
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,347
And Jim.

340
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,682
You got to be
kidding me. Okay.

341
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,018
Okay.

342
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,854
Florida group,
welcome to the team.

343
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,282
Let's go!

344
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,619
Step it up, you runts.
You infants. Let's move.

345
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,121
Why is it so
hot in here?

346
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:59,250
Hot? What are you talking about?
This is a nice, temperate Florida morning.

347
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,377
Eighty-five degrees,
73% humidity.

348
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,004
This is the exact environment
that you will be facing

349
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,132
for the next three
weeks of your life.

350
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,635
Welcome to Special
Projects orientation.

351
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,762
The next three weeks
of your life

352
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:15,224
are going to be the most
miserable you've ever faced.

353
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,018
They're going to be hard.
They're going to be dirty.

354
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,396
You're going to
wish you were dead.

355
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,314
But?

356
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,108
"But?" There's no "buts."

357
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:27,069
That's it. You'll wish you were
dead. You seem a little disturbed.

358
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,863
Do you want to stay
here? No. No. I want to go.

359
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,158
Because if any of you
would prefer to stay here,

360
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,368
all you need to do
is ring this bell.

361
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,245
Is that the buzzer
from Taboo?

362
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,622
Shut up, maggot!
It is.

363
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,374
You don't want to go,
ring the bell!

364
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,418
Ring it. Ring it.

365
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,754
How many of you have seen
the documentary Deliverance?

366
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,966
How did a mosquito
get in here?

367
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,844
I released 300 mosquitoes
into the conference room.

368
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,179
Just temporarily.

369
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,056
When I'm done, the frogs will
take care of the mosquitoes.

370
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,479
Yes. And then he brushes
your soft supple cheeks

371
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,816
with his worn leathery
hands and says,

372
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,028
“I'm going to make you
the seventh Mrs. Rosenblat!"

373
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,779
Unless you ring
the bell. Ring it.

374
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,947
Ring the bell.

375
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,867
You want to spend the rest of your life
changing your husband's colostomy bags?

376
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,286
Huh? Do you? Ring it!
What? Ah.

377
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,289
What was that?
Mosquito.

378
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,048
Orientation's over.

379
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,468
Darryl, hey.

380
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,636
Hey, what's up?
You called?

381
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,930
Yeah, you know,
I felt really terrible

382
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,474
that you got me these lovely
gloves, and I didn't get you anything.

383
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,600
It's cool, really.

384
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,518
No, it's anything
but cool.

385
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:46,732
Now, I haven't really had time to
go out and buy you anything, but

386
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,234
here goes.

387
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,946
"This coupon entitles you to
one free tickle monster attack."

388
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,532
Yeah. They're Nate coupons or
Nate-pons. And they're all different.

389
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,369
Cash that one in and I
will bring you a stick of gum

390
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,914
any time, any place.
I'll find you.

391
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,291
Thanks.

392
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,253
Nice flowers.

393
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,879
Thanks. They're
from my mom.

394
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,757
Your mom?

395
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,093
Yeah.

396
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,386
Oh.

397
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:19,223
So I guess that was your mom who
called me earlier looking for the address.

398
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,516
Real deep-voiced woman.

399
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,184
Yeah, that's her.

400
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,187
She said her name
was Brandon, I think.

401
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,814
Your mom's name
is Brandon?

402
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,986
Yeah, Darryl. My
mom's name is Brandon.

403
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,909
I guess I figured
out where I stand.

404
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:42,037
This is a love beanie.

405
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,294
Okay, Florida team,
let's reconvene.

406
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,391
I'm going to Florida.
And I'm not coming back.

407
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,814
So Sabre has set up a conference
room for our use while we're at corporate.

408
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,733
So what is this
special project?

409
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,526
Basically, Sabre has
tasked us with

410
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,528
helping them branch into
the retail market place.

411
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,405
They want to set up their
own version of an Apple store.

412
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,740
That sounds awesome.

413
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,700
It did. It did.

414
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,826
You know what
might be great?

415
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,704
Is if instead of a genius
bar, we have a lounge area

416
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,998
where people can ask
questions about the product

417
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,583
with other customers
who liked it.

418
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,587
Yeah, and they should have a place where
people can check their computers or printers

419
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,131
before they see you, so you don't
have to carry it around like a dope.

420
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,758
Like a coat check.

421
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,681
Oh, don't write it down
unless you like it.

422
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:43,766
Oh, I like it.

423
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,852
It seems to me that the Apple
store is kind of like a party,

424
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,772
so I think our question is, how
do we make this a better party?

425
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,525
No. We sell business tools and
the stores need to reflect that.

426
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,945
They need to be all business. Let all
the other stores look like a toy store.

427
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:00,366
Right. Think different.
From Apple.

428
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,287
Dwight, is now a good time to
go over what you expect of us?

429
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,421
Yes.

430
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,340
What are my expectations
for the group?

431
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,885
I have been given the responsibility
to manage Stanley, a solid player.

432
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,096
Ryan, who is capable
of surprises.

433
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,014
Erin, an excellent
follower.

434
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,476
And Cathy, a probably not
totally useless enigma.

435
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,978
And, well, Jim.

436
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,316
Under the right manager,
that's not a bad team.

437
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,152
Perfektenschlag.

438
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,494
I don't know how I'm going
to live here without you.

439
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,247
Me neither. Hey, will you
put this coat on my chair?

440
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,665
I just realized I'm not
going to need it down there.

441
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,375
Yes, I will take
your coat.

442
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,793
And I will keep it
with me,

443
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,586
and I will sleep with it
because it smells like you.

444
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,004
No, no, no, no, no.
Just put it on my chair.

445
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,216
All right.

446
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,718
Bye. Call me when
you land. I will.

447
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,012
Safe travels!

448
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,182
Goodbye for a very,
very long time.

449
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,351
Okay.

450
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,186
It's only three weeks.

451
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,192
All expenses paid.

452
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,736
Yeah. Jim's going
to be there.

453
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,198
That marriage is not good.
Nobody knows better than me.

454
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,034
Definitely, we will.

455
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,329
It's three weeks in Tallahassee.
What else is there to do?
