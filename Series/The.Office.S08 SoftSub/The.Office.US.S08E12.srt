1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,179
Oh... Oh...

2
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:14,598
What is this?

3
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:19,144
A meatball? Really?

4
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,355
It's always more fun to mess
with Dwight with an audience.

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,815
That was usually Pam.

6
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,109
So now that she's out,
I had to find someone else.

7
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:30,363
Turns out that Stanley
is quite the comedy fan.

8
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,242
But not everything
makes him laugh.

9
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,704
He has very specific tastes.

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,753
Through a painstaking process of
trial and error, I found out what he likes.

11
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,797
And it's really weird.

12
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,884
Jim, come on. So juvenile.

13
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,345
What the...

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,472
You've been meatballed.

15
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,683
Are you ready
for some meatballs?

16
00:00:58,767 --> 00:00:59,976
Oh, man!

17
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,312
This is not very clever, Jim.

18
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,606
I know.
Look for your stapler.

19
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,071
Really, Jim? Really?

20
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:14,824
Very funny.

21
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,953
Okay, good night.

22
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,508
What's the haul?

23
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,301
Thirty-two meatballs.

24
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,553
Good day.

25
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,597
That idiot's been
feeding us for a week.

26
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,766
We'll never have to
buy meatballs again.

27
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,209
Dunder Mifflin.

28
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,045
Jessica, hi, how are you?

29
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,298
Yay, that's so great to hear.

30
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,591
I'm not going to be one of
those exes who can't move on.

31
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,802
They have their
life and I have mine.

32
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,762
I'm taking an Italian class.

33
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:22,684
So far, I have learned
tortellini, spaghettini, linguine.

34
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,312
Well, it's not so much
a class as a restaurant.

35
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,064
But I do Monday, Wednesday,
Friday from 7:00 to 9:00.

36
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,108
I will patch you
through right now.

37
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,069
You sound really
pretty today. Okay.

38
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,284
Jessica, I love you.

39
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,494
That's a message from my mom.

40
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:45,248
My parents met Jessica, and
they completely flipped for her so,

41
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,043
they gave me this old
family ring to use on her.

42
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,086
I know. Whoa.
Pump the brakes, Bernard.

43
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,589
Too early, I get it.
I just... You know,

44
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,008
I'm just carrying it around,
seeing how it feels.

45
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,344
I haven't proposed
to anyone in years.

46
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,805
Mom took the main diamond out.
She thought that had more of a

47
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,099
"my little brother"
kind of vibe to it. But...

48
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,311
Whoa. It's pretty nice.

49
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,229
Got a little bit of
The Shining vibe, though.

50
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,731
Who needs a house that size?

51
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,025
Big, stupid, pure chump bait.

52
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,777
I'm selling the house,
actually.

53
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,029
No, there's
a glare from over here.

54
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,114
Oh, wow, that's magnificent.

55
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:22,160
It's mid-recession in a
depressed area of a faltering state,

56
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,496
and I've got the most
expensive house on the market.

57
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,581
The 1% are
suffering too, people.

58
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,959
I bought it to be
my Playboy Mansion.

59
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:34,464
A temple to wine,
revelry, sex, intrigue.

60
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,717
This was hot on the heels of
Eyes Wide Shut, mind you.

61
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,554
Then I met my wife,
she moved in, made it her own.

62
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,307
Now she's left me and
forced me to sell the place.

63
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,351
The ultimate insult,
they're calling

64
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,144
my speakeasy
lounge a rumpus room.

65
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,066
Does my turmoil
amuse you, Jim?

66
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,527
I'm sorry. I thought
you were making a joke.

67
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,114
What could you possibly
have found funny in what I said?

68
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,324
What was the joke
you thought you heard?

69
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,870
I guess I thought
you were approaching it

70
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,331
with more of
a sarcasm than misery.

71
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,876
Kind of laughing
at your own pain.

72
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,586
Sad clown thing.

73
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,798
Oh, yes. How hilarious it is,

74
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:21,511
to laugh at clowns, the painted
jesters of a dying circus industry.

75
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,096
Very funny, Jim. I get it.

76
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:28,560
Um, I'm getting reports of a serious
outbreak of the "grumpies" in here.

77
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:34,149
A beautiful monster cost me
my 40s and my dream home.

78
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,944
I think I'm entitled to
the occasional bad day.

79
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,613
Well, please tell
Susan we all say hi.

80
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,200
Dude, what if,
since you're feeling grumpy,

81
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,412
we all swing by
tonight and check out

82
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,913
your indoor pool?
Kevin, no.

83
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,207
Like some sort
of last hurrah?

84
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,919
Yeah. All of us in the pool,
saying hurrah.

85
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,839
Maybe the last one
that says hurrah is "it."

86
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,801
Well, I suppose someone
should enjoy the place

87
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,513
before I hand it over to the staging
experts at RE/MAX tomorrow.

88
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,681
Let's try this.

89
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,684
Everyone, tonight, my house,
wear a swimsuit.

90
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,519
Let's just call
it a get-together.

91
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,146
And let's say no food.

92
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,442
Hey, Oscar, was
that you who just

93
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,987
created a party out of
thin air or was it me?

94
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,238
That was you, Kevin.

95
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,573
It was me.

96
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,284
You going tonight, kiddo?
Because I can give you a lift.

97
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,827
Oh, I don't know,
Meredith, it seems like

98
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,412
you shouldn't drive,
maybe ever.

99
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,706
It's no problem.
You live right near me.

100
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,790
How do you know
where I live?

101
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,084
Andy followed you home
after the Christmas party.

102
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,003
Why?

103
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,963
He wanted to make sure
California didn't put it in you.

104
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,256
Oh. Come on.

105
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,680
Wow. Andy's such
a weird stalker.

106
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:51,100
Following me home like that
when he has a girlfriend,

107
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,603
I should get a restraining
order.

108
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,106
It is warm.

109
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,942
It's almost too warm.

110
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,070
I'm feeling 82, 82.5.

111
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,197
Oh. So close. Eighty-one.

112
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,617
Well, we'll say it's 82,
and it'll be our secret.

113
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,371
Hey, late guy.
Hey.

114
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,792
Wow. Just stopping by.
Got another party to go to.

115
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,878
A wife and two Kids
at home party. Oh.

116
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:22,757
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning
some serious Radio Disney tonight.

117
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,177
You're looking at the master
of leaving parties early.

118
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,971
The key is you have to
make a strong impression,

119
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,807
SO you want to have a picture
taken, you want to say some peculiar

120
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,850
non sequitur that
people remember,

121
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,521
you want to note something
unique, a talking point for later.

122
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,608
I don't mean to brag, but New
Year's Eve, I was home by 9:00.

123
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,653
Robert, I just wanted to
grab you for one second.

124
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,238
This place is amazing,
by the way.

125
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,406
You should see
the whole thing.

126
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,032
I bet I should.

127
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,703
That's beautiful. I'm
going to e-mail that to you.

128
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,037
I'm just about
to give the tour.

129
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,414
All right. Well.
Join us.

130
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,082
You must see what you
were laughing about.

131
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,834
I must.

132
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,253
Wow.

133
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,676
Yeah, that's some
pretty serious poolage.

134
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,970
Hmm?
What are you doing?

135
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,347
Flicking a bug
off my weiner.

136
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,182
Gross.

137
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:14,976
I'm getting a drink.
Do you want anything?

138
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,060
No, I'm good.

139
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:24,027
Funny how you can be surrounded
by people and still feel so lonely.

140
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,529
Hi.

141
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,657
How is everything?
How's your car?

142
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,996
It's great, you know,
reliable, great mileage.

143
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,289
Is that so?

144
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,585
How about this weekend we take that
sucker to a duck pond or something?

145
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,962
Maybe get caught in the rain.

146
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,342
Well, I can't. I'm
going skiing with Jessica.

147
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,844
Couple of dopes
on the slopes.

148
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,346
Oh. Like a goodbye trip.

149
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,765
No. What?

150
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,809
Hey.

151
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,229
I guess Andy isn't totally
over his current girlfriend.

152
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,981
But if he was
jealous once before,

153
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,816
then maybe I can
make him jealous again.

154
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,318
Just not with Robert.

155
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:09,197
He told me he was a ride I
wouldn't survive, and I believe him.

156
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,617
Wow. You made it.
Yeah. Yeah.

157
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,830
Uh-oh. Look at this. Red
plastic cup, red plastic cup.

158
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,332
How about that?

159
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,751
You know, you are
just as dumb at night.

160
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,002
Mmm.

161
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,255
There is...
This would be no problem.

162
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,965
I could swim under one breath!

163
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,050
No! Show me.
All right.

164
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,969
Dive in from here
right now. Okay.

165
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,434
Hey, Dwight Snoot. What you
doing? Wait, relaxing. Scram.

166
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,977
God.

167
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:44,607
Hey, Stanley,
what happened to my pants?

168
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:48,319
I moved them. Pants only need
a chair if there's a person in them.

169
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,036
Come on,
don't you want to play?

170
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,538
Oh, really?
Yeah.

171
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,831
You want to play,
you little hick?

172
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,543
Dwight!

173
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,128
- Awesome!
- Dwight!

174
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,297
Here we have
the parlor.

175
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,135
I imagined people
would set down their coats

176
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,804
and symbolically,
their inhibitions.

177
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,473
This was the gateway.

178
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,644
You enter this room a lawyer,
a doctor, a teacher, a judge,

179
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:27,024
but beyond it, you are simply a
penis, a vagina, a hunger, an ache.

180
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,528
Susan used it as
a Pilates studio.

181
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,863
Holy cow.

182
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,823
My wine collection.

183
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,575
How many bottles?
Three hundred?

184
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,909
About 1,200.

185
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,828
What the hell,
grab a bottle.

186
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,997
Less inventory
for the lawyers.

187
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,249
Toby, Chateau Margaux, '95.

188
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,542
You know your wine.

189
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:50,673
Well. And you have a...
Yes, another chateau.

190
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,967
Robert, you are too kind.

191
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,969
Too kind doesn't
begin to cover it.

192
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:58,556
With ammunition like this, we
are in for quite a night, you and me.

193
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,349
And Gabey makes three.

194
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,936
Robert, thank you. Thank you
for this, thank you for all this.

195
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,146
This night's been magical.

196
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,397
Jim, come see
this next room.

197
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,316
I think you
especially would like it.

198
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,234
Really? Why?
I don't know.

199
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,195
Maybe not. Just come.

200
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,205
Do you regret
attacking me now, hick?

201
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,792
Huh? Dwight. Stop it.
I was flirting with you.

202
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,002
I was trying to use
you to make Andy jealous.

203
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,504
I'm not going to help you.

204
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,297
Why would you choose me?
Because I'm mighty?

205
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,258
Because I'm the manliest
man in the office? I'll do it!

206
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,849
Stop.
You stop.

207
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,768
No, you stop.
No, you stop.

208
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,355
Is he looking? You can stop.

209
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,981
Okay, you can stop. No,
no, no, he's not looking.

210
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,149
You can actually stop.

211
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,692
Whoa, you guys,

212
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,695
I just found this
insane engagement ring.

213
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,863
Is anyone missing this?

214
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,073
The main stone's missing.

215
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,367
I don't know.
It looks pretty great to me.

216
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,913
I pictured myself
here every night,

217
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,374
eating a leg of
mutton, the juices

218
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,919
dripping down my bare chest,
wiping my fingers on the walls.

219
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,255
Then I met the vegan.

220
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,007
Good night.
To the kitchen.

221
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,884
To the kitchen.
To the kitchen.

222
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:19,679
To the kitchen.

223
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,266
- Onward.
- Toby,

224
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,185
what's compelling about this
is the note of persimmon.

225
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,937
Right?
Note?

226
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,856
It's a symphony.
Okay.

227
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,899
You have to join my
wine tasting club.

228
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,150
I would love that.

229
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,446
Toby, you are
playing a dangerous game.

230
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,784
I guess I'm through
the gateway now though, right?

231
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,956
You know,

232
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,626
I don't think I've ever been
in this exact angle before.

233
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,087
I'm scared of firsts,
but I like it.

234
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,131
You guys got to
try this pool.

235
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:59,135
No top scum, no Band-Aids,
this thing is choice.

236
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,636
You in?

237
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,306
Yeah. Sure, sure,
I'll be right in.

238
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,557
I've been working out,

239
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,811
but the problem is, I've been
building muscle underneath

240
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:13,149
and that top layer
hasn't burned off yet.

241
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,151
Awkward stage.

242
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,403
Mmm.

243
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:21,240
So good. Now take a chip,
and crush it into my face

244
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:24,493
and rub the grease around.
Do it. Yeah, rub it in.

245
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,329
Yeah.
That's so good.

246
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,581
Andy's not even looking.

247
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,334
I think sexy eating is
a dead end. Damn it.

248
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,379
What is the most
romantic possible thing?

249
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,258
We can get some chicken fights
going in the pool.

250
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,511
Dwight, that's just...
That's really perfect.

251
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,722
Yes!
Thank you. Yes.

252
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,518
You're in my lane!

253
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:51,812
Andy,

254
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,148
Dwight and I challenge you
and Jess to a chicken fight.

255
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,232
Winner take all.

256
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,359
Chicken fight!

257
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,860
No, thanks.
Dang it!

258
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,111
What the heck already!

259
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,197
Cathy, chicken fight!

260
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,367
Okay, yeah, who's going to
be my partner? Where's Jim?

261
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,369
I'm right here.

262
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,210
Come on, Cath.

263
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:16,963
Yes!

264
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,047
Whoo!

265
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,842
Dwight, our chemistry is really
clicking. We work so well together.

266
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,345
I know. I could just
bang you right now.

267
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,599
He's not looking. Hey!

268
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,853
I had two bears sewn together
to make this king size.

269
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,398
Total waste of two bears.

270
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,609
To both these bears.

271
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,195
- To both these bears.
- Bears.

272
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,406
To both these bears.

273
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,619
When I put in the screening
room, I bought three movies.

274
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:53,374
Caligula, Last Tango in
Paris and Emmanuelle 2.

275
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,042
Mwal!

276
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,672
The last two movies I
actually watched in here were

277
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,592
Marley ♪ Me and
On Golden Pond.

278
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,595
I mean, it's clearly meant
for watching erotic cinema.

279
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,764
Yeah. We could watch some
right now, if you want.

280
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,435
I've got a Korean
film on my iPod.

281
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,271
If you want to just...
If you have the cables.

282
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,816
Kelly, that's
a crazy ring you found.

283
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,152
Yeah. Thanks, I'm
really glad that I found it.

284
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,778
I can't believe
you're wearing it.

285
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,238
Are you not
superstitious at all?

286
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,949
Of course I'm
superstitious, what are you talking about?

287
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,995
Ring of a failed marriage might
have some sinister energy, right?

288
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,246
Am I just being silly?

289
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,956
I don't think
you're being silly.

290
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,041
Oh, God.

291
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,292
You know what?
I can just sell it

292
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,668
and put the money
in the party fund.

293
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,378
Oh...

294
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,255
Then another woman will
get it, we can't allow that.

295
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,798
We have to destroy it.

296
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,633
Come on. Let's
chicken fight those two.

297
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,349
How was that?
Okay, watch my toes.

298
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,937
Hey, Val, want a beer?

299
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,356
It might taste better than that
pool water you've been drinking.

300
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,816
No, I'm good. Thank you.

301
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,401
Cool.
Cool.

302
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,197
Does Darryl not swim?

303
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,075
That's racist. I don't know,

304
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:13,329
but I would say by looking at
him, no, Darryl does not swim.

305
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,541
That's all right!
That's all right! We got this!

306
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,168
Yeah!
Yeah!

307
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,340
Maybe we should take a little
break. Dwight, we've got this.

308
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,176
I promise. I will not leave
your shoulders no matter what.

309
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,844
Okay.

310
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,971
- One more?
- Yeah. Great.

311
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,727
Mush! Mush! Mush!

312
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,688
Come on!
Go!

313
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,193
Here we go.

314
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,195
Yay!

315
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,197
Whoa!
Wow.

316
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,117
I cannot believe you're still
on. I can't believe it either.

317
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,160
I've got this!

318
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,887
Erin, did we win?

319
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,682
Sure. Sure, we did.

320
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,393
You're lying.
We didn't win.

321
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,354
Hey, hey, hey, Dwight!
It's okay! Just rest. Just rest.

322
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,731
You've broken up your
last couple, you evil ring.

323
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:24,567
Do it.

324
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,238
We're in the pool.
Shove it, Angela.

325
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,242
Same old party,
same old people, am I right?

326
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,286
Reminds me of
Phyllis' birthday.

327
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,289
Ooh. Do not remind me
of Phyllis' birthday. I know.

328
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,418
But boy, that Erin, she sure
is a ripe little tiger, isn't she?

329
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,378
Meow!

330
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,590
And to think I always thought
of her as a second Meredith.

331
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,635
Respectfully, I don't
want us walking into

332
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,263
a similar Angela kind
of situation. Mmm.

333
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,682
So I just want to make sure
that you are completely

334
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,435
100% done with Erin.

335
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:05,858
Last I checked, I'm with Jessica
and I like to get my monog on.

336
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,944
It's monogamy
for my hog and me.

337
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,404
Not what I asked.
We're done.

338
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,114
Erin and I are over.
Okay.

339
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:16,535
So then you won't mind if
tonight I just go crazy on her?

340
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,871
Just go nuts...

341
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,956
With sex.

342
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,750
Have at it.

343
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,961
Or take it slow,
whatever you guys work out.

344
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,091
You're an idiot.

345
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,941
Cannonball!

346
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,572
Let's do this.

347
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,121
Oh...

348
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,333
So I kind of stepped on this.
I think it's yours.

349
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,834
Yeah.

350
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,461
Oh. Wow.

351
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,630
How did you know
it was mine?

352
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,091
The Bernard family seal, duh.

353
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:14,885
Duh.

354
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,307
Sorry if your
special night was ruined.

355
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:25,187
Oh, whoa, whoa, no,
it's not a special night.

356
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,940
Oh, you weren't
going to do it?

357
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,902
Honestly, Erin,
I don't know what I'm doing.

358
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,365
I just...

359
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,284
I don't know.

360
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:41,745
Thank you.

361
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,960
Andy's confused.

362
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,504
That's not what I was hoping
for. But it's not so bad either.

363
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,299
I can live with confused.
I get confused.

364
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,301
I totally get confused.

365
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,720
And, of course,
the pool.

366
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:04,101
Ultimate lubricant
for any wild evening.

367
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:10,232
It was here that my parties would
have crescendoed into true madness.

368
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,651
To madness.

369
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,653
Madness.
To madness.

370
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,071
To madness!

371
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,618
Hey, I think you
parked my car in.

372
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,953
Is there any way
you can move your van?

373
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,664
Hey, I'm sorry. When I got
here, I put my keys in a bowl.

374
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:26,790
Are you serious?

375
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,752
Robert, I want you to know, I'm here
to rock with you as late as you want.

376
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,212
And that goes
double for me.

377
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,089
I'll stay even
later than you'd like.

378
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,644
Toby, I am Bacchus,
god of wine.

379
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,355
And I am Bacchus' friend!

380
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,363
Gentlemen, bear witness,
while I've been

381
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,281
mourning the nights
that never were,

382
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,034
one of them has been
unfolding here before me.

383
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,125
This is no get-together.

384
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:12,795
This is a party.

385
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,059
Yes!

386
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,984
And there's
my talking point.

387
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,260
Yes, that's it.
Push yourselves, boys.

388
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,013
It's not a party if you don't
do something that scares you.

389
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,184
I need a breather.

390
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,858
You two keep going.

391
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,278
Hey, he's asleep.
We can just leave.

392
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,196
So leave.
