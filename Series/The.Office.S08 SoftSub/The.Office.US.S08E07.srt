1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:03,920
Erin, hey.

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,840
In two minutes, I want you
to come into this meeting

3
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:09,467
and tell me that I have a
really important phone call.

4
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:11,803
I'm not going
to take it

5
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,598
because I want him to know
how important the meeting is to me.

6
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,392
Who's calling?
Nobody.

7
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:21,646
Just say that I'm... Just make
it up that I have a phone call.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,398
And then I'm going
to refuse to take it.

9
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:24,691
You're not going
to take it?

10
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:25,734
Just make up
a phone call.

11
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,027
It's not
a real call.

12
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,195
Just make it up.

13
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,821
Oh, okay. And then
come in and tell me.

14
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:30,947
Okay.

15
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,073
It doesn't matter
what it is.

16
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,200
You're not going
to get it, though.

17
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,242
I'm not going
to take it.

18
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,660
And then he's
going to be like,

19
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,162
"Wow, this is a really
important meeting."

20
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,122
Copy that.
Okay.

21
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,125
Okay, so,

22
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,920
tell me exactly
what kind of deal

23
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,465
you are getting right now and
I'll tell you how we can beat it.

24
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:50,217
Well, we've been
going with...

25
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,301
Andy?

26
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,385
Yeah?

27
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,470
You have a very
important call.

28
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,056
I'm sorry, I'm with a very
important client. It'll have to wait.

29
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,683
Are you sure? It's
really, really important.

30
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:03,813
There is nothing more important
to me right now than this meeting.

31
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,567
Really? Because
your mother is dead.

32
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,657
Oh, my God!

33
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,076
I don't think she's dead.

34
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,329
She's dead.
She was hit by a bus.

35
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,957
She's not dead.
This is exactly

36
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,875
the kind of thing
my mom pulls.

37
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,836
This isn't one of those
times. It's the police.

38
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,006
They said it's the
worst they've ever seen.

39
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,509
Andy, I'm really sorry
about your mother.

40
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,011
My deepest
condolences.

41
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:40,725
You must take
this call. It's...

42
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,354
Yeah, line one?

43
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,730
Line two.

44
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,148
Okay.

45
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,902
It's Darryl.

46
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,280
Erin told me to pretend to be
a cop and say your mom died.

47
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,531
Oh!

48
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,449
Gosh.

49
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,951
Dude.
Thank you, Officer.

50
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,536
Look, man,
this is a bad idea.

51
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,121
Did she have
any last words or...

52
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,081
Really?
That is messed up, man.

53
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:07,544
Make sure that your client
gets the best deal possible.

54
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,920
You're a bad man,
Andy Bernard.

55
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,755
That is so Mom. That stuff
can come back and get you.

56
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,632
It's called karma. You do
not want to be messing...

57
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,883
All right,
but thank you, Officer.

58
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,218
I've got an uncle...

59
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,348
Erin, please hold
all my other calls.

60
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,394
Where were we?

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,335
Hey, Cathy.

62
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,753
How's it going?
Everything make sense?

63
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,212
I think everything
is under control.

64
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,756
Great.
You should sit down.

65
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,174
No, I'm fine.

66
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,675
No, I should go
fill out my paperwork.

67
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,177
Okay.

68
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,099
That was just me.
Pregnant Pam.

69
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,435
And I make sounds
much worse than this.

70
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,978
We know.

71
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:12,692
I'm training a temp to be my
replacement while I'm on maternity leave.

72
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,362
I should have
mentioned I'm pregnant.

73
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,323
You probably
didn't notice because

74
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,742
it's impossible to tell
because I'm so small.

75
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,911
But yeah, I'm pregnant.

76
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,747
Oh, come on.

77
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,083
Hey. Asking for a friend,

78
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,210
do you happen to know
if that new girl is single?

79
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,754
Doubt it.

80
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,798
Yeah. Me, too.

81
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,717
You doubt it?

82
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:38,968
What's that?

83
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,887
Why do you doubt
that she's single?

84
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:45,308
Honestly, I have no idea. I just
figured we'd save her from Ryan, right?

85
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,482
What are you
doing with my lunch?

86
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,401
I'm delivering it
from the fridge.

87
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,903
It's like a porno. "Hey,
did anybody order a pizza?"

88
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,655
It's not pizza.

89
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,323
Yeah, and we're not
about to make love.

90
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,658
I just thought
maybe you'd want

91
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,034
to eat lunch at
your desk today

92
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,120
so that during lunch
we could go down

93
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,247
to the warehouse and
bang out a few tunes.

94
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,499
I like the sound of that.
Is Kevin here?

95
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,335
You tell me.

96
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,718
So word on the street
is she has a boyfriend.

97
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,763
Well, he's probably
a drug dealer.

98
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,598
That's the best way to
land a hot girlfriend.

99
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,517
You just...
You get her hooked on blow.

100
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,937
It's going to be nice
to have just like a

101
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,523
healthy, young, fit presence
in the middle of the office.

102
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,607
Yes, aesthetically
speaking, strictly.

103
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,650
Yeah.

104
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,152
- She adds a nice presence.
- Good energy.

105
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,945
Yeah, it's going to
be nice to have

106
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,655
someone hot at
Pam's desk, huh?

107
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,949
No, no. Not even.

108
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,576
I'm kidding.

109
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,996
Oh, my gosh, you guys. She's
obviously super cute. I get it.

110
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,623
But I'd like to point
out there is 50 pounds

111
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,667
more of me to love,
if that's your thing.

112
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,085
Pam, you look more
beautiful now than ever.

113
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,253
Radiant.

114
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,672
Thank you, guys. Really,
thank you, very sweet.

115
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,799
Yeah, you have
this sexy glow.

116
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,260
Well, it's one of
the most common fetishes.

117
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,471
Really? Well,
thank you all.

118
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,931
You know, it's not just pregnant
women who don't get their due.

119
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,558
You know who's gorgeous?

120
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,893
Helen Mirren.
Yes.

121
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,979
Yes, have you seen her
in a bikini? Amazing.

122
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,982
What would be the hottest thing
ever is a pregnant Helen Mirren.

123
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,358
Ooh!

124
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:23,281
Okay, okay.
Okay, no, no, no.

125
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,617
This is disgusting. Do you
realize what you're saying?

126
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,120
The hottest thing ever would be
a 66-year-old pregnant woman?

127
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,122
In this case, yes.
No!

128
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:35,585
There are universal biological
standards of beauty and attraction.

129
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,838
And you are purposefully
celebrating the opposite of them

130
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,882
to mollycoddle
a pregnant woman.

131
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,091
No, we're not. No.

132
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,259
Yes, you are.

133
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,096
And another thing, Helen
Mirren was born Helen Mironoff.

134
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:51,017
That's right, you're fake salivating
over a Soviet-era Russian.

135
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,659
Nice scatting, man.

136
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,037
Thank you. I think I said "doop"
instead of "boop" at one point.

137
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,414
Not bad, fellas.
You're better than you look.

138
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,291
Hey, screw you!

139
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,128
Hey, Robert.
Are we meeting early?

140
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,089
Just taking a stroll.

141
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,883
What exactly have
I stumbled upon here?

142
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,678
Well, we're all musicians and
we play together sometimes.

143
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,096
You're a band?

144
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,305
Thank you.

145
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,891
We're called
Kevin and the Zits.

146
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,893
That was never agreed upon.

147
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,645
I miss being in a band.

148
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,147
Miss no more.
What do you play? Join us.

149
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,066
I have a tambourine.

150
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,986
Tambourine? You know
I'm the CEO, right?

151
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,072
CEOs don't play tambourines.
Tambourines are for girlfriends.

152
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,908
I play harmonica. I think
I have one in the car.

153
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,743
Great.
Nice.

154
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,247
Guys, Robert is
going to be a zit.

155
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,791
Again, never agreed upon.

156
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,377
I had totally given up on
hanging out with Robert California

157
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,671
and now he wants
to be in our band.

158
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,131
And when you're in
a rock and roll band

159
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,549
with somebody,
you're bonded for life.

160
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,343
Usually that life
is short and tragic.

161
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,304
That's okay, right?

162
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,847
Yeah, even cooler.

163
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,349
We all got to
go sometime.

164
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,311
Hey.

165
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,062
Helen Mirren. Hot?

166
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,773
Yeah. Super pretty.

167
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,899
Huh.

168
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,693
What about Cathy?

169
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,902
The temp?

170
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,030
Yeah, do you think
she's hot? Nope.

171
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,324
I'm not asking
if you're into her.

172
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,451
Just objectively,
do you find her attractive?

173
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,036
I'm telling you I don't.

174
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,163
You don't find
Cathy attractive?

175
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,706
No, I don't.

176
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,418
No, I'm not going to tell my
nine months pregnant wife

177
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,421
that I find her replacement
objectively attractive.

178
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,173
Just like I'm not going to
tell my 2-year-old daughter

179
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,343
that violent video games
are objectively more fun.

180
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,679
It's true, but it
doesn't help anybody.

181
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,806
Look at her.

182
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,185
Even I want some
fries with that shake.

183
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,690
Okay. I don't.
So are we good?

184
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,030
That's just absurd.

185
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,865
Yes, because
she's hot, right?

186
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,867
Her breasts are large,
her waist is small,

187
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,661
her reproductive health
in ample evidence.

188
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,579
Facial symmetry, come on.

189
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,708
The thing about pregnancy
is people treat you differently.

190
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,960
Like you're
a kid, almost.

191
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,962
They lose all
sense of boundaries.

192
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:29,258
They start acting weird, telling
you things that clearly aren't true.

193
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,095
I know it sounds nuts
but I think Dwight

194
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,722
is the only one who's
telling me the truth.

195
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,934
Dwight, am I hot right now?

196
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,436
Why would I or anyone else
think that you're hot right now?

197
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,271
I can't impregnate you
and that's the driving

198
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,190
force between
male-female attraction.

199
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,609
What about before?
Was I attractive before?

200
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,027
Eh...

201
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,572
You were at your most attractive when
you were 24, with a slight gradual decline.

202
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,033
And a steep drop off when you
got pregnant for the first time.

203
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,618
Gradual recovery and...

204
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:59,247
Well, now obviously
you're at an all-time low.

205
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,791
Hmm.

206
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,130
I think Jim's lying to me about
not being attracted to Cathy.

207
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,883
You think Jim's lying?
That's so cute.

208
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,552
I know he's lying.

209
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:13,886
5 bucks if you can
get him to admit it.

210
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,054
Done.

211
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,557
I never touch
a pregnant woman.

212
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,350
Yeah, that's
the Dwight I need.

213
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,438
If we're going to work together,
we need some ground rules.

214
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,564
Okay.

215
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,859
Rule one, our only
loyalty is to the truth.

216
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,194
I think so. Okay.

217
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,946
Rule two,
we stop at nothing.

218
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,324
What is that...
Is it... Well, okay.

219
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,576
Rule three.

220
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,202
Don't fall in love.

221
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,370
Yup. Good.

222
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,748
We're going to
bust this guy.

223
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,458
Honesty is very
important to me.

224
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,044
So important. And then we
will destroy the man himself.

225
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,047
Let's just see how we feel
when we get there.

226
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,842
Well, you came to
the right person.

227
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,761
You have to follow
your intuition, Pam.

228
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,763
You don't want to end up
like Elin Nordegren.

229
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,557
Actually, what am I saying? You
wish you had her life. No offense, Pam.

230
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,559
None taken.
What have you got?

231
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,979
It is called the Matchmaker
Test and it is very powerful.

232
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,981
Basically, we have Pam
ask Jim which

233
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,941
of his friends he would
set up with Cathy.

234
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,943
If Jim picks
a really hot friend,

235
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,029
then we know
he thinks that Cathy's hot.

236
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,365
Hmm.

237
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,627
Hey, you found us.

238
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,462
You guys sound
great, man.

239
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:33,341
Darryl, Andy, Kevin, this is
Curtis Dorough, local musician,

240
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,092
and the officiate
at my wedding.

241
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,928
Local musician?

242
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,846
Local legend.
I used to come hear you

243
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,807
play every week
at the Deerhead.

244
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,683
Dude, you're on TV.

245
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,311
You're the sportscaster
on Channel Seven.

246
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,021
Go, Eagles!

247
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,689
You do that on TV.

248
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,191
You guys mind
if they join us?

249
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,026
Yeah, sure.

250
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,946
Guys, I've got some
instruments right here.

251
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,405
Hey, why don't you
and me play those?

252
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,740
Yeah?

253
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:58,950
Okay, this is awesome.

254
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,243
What shall we play?

255
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,411
Maybe we should warm up
with some scales?

256
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,121
Midnight Rambler?
Yeah.

257
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,165
Midnight what?

258
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,342
Have you heard about
the midnight rambler?

259
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,640
Hey, this is crazy

260
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,048
Hey, I was talking to Cathy.
Turns out she is single.

261
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,676
Oh, I stand corrected.

262
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,512
I thought it might be fun
to set her up with someone.

263
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:02,930
Any ideas?

264
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,892
Oh. You know who might
be good? Mike Tibbets.

265
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,060
Mike Tibbets, really?

266
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,478
Hey, who's this
Mike Tibbets guy?

267
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,980
What kind of
car does he drive?

268
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,441
Not his mom's car.

269
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,985
Yeah, because his mom's car's
probably not a Nissan Z.

270
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,488
Touché?

271
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,659
Kelly, calm down.

272
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,244
I mean, I guess
he'd be okay with hair.

273
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,163
Okay, you should see
if he'll get hair plugs.

274
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,706
I don't think Jim
cares about his hair.

275
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,207
Yeah, but I do, Pam. Okay?

276
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,459
It's called
being a nice person.

277
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,752
I don't see what's
so ugly about him.

278
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,462
He's got the broad
face of a brewer.

279
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,672
Hmm?
Jim's on to me.

280
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,342
Yeah, Jim barely
talks to Mike.

281
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,801
We had to go through
like two levels

282
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,261
of friends to even
find his profile.

283
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,431
Jim picked someone
just unattractive

284
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,850
enough to shut me up
without tipping it.

285
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,603
Just ugly enough
to have deniability.

286
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,146
Yup.

287
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,524
Mike Tibbets is like the
most boring looking guy I know.

288
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,612
So if that was for the Matchmaker
Test, I think I'm in the clear.

289
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,658
If that wasn't for
the Matchmaker Test then...

290
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,826
Cathy, he's a really
nice guy.

291
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,703
Well, Jim may be
lying with his words,

292
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,580
but he can't
lie with his body.

293
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,291
I'm going to write
something mean on his wall.

294
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,960
No, Kelly, don't.

295
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,378
The male reveals attraction

296
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,631
through unconscious and
involuntary physical signs.

297
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,591
The puffing of the chest.

298
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:21,717
Mirroring.

299
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,220
Increased blood flow
to the crotch.

300
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,889
I say we start there.

301
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,057
With the crotch?
With the crotch?

302
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,059
With the crotch.

303
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,991
Whoo!

304
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,952
Psst.

305
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,662
We're not here.
Who said that?

306
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,122
Exactly.

307
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,665
How'd I get
this long triangle?

308
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,083
Okay, just shut up.

309
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,752
Is he puffing out his chest?

310
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,921
I can't tell.
It's unnaturally sunken.

311
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,260
Busted. He just was
mirroring. Did you see that?

312
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,554
No. Maybe he just
said something funny.

313
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,807
Jim has no discernible sense of
humor, Pam. You should know that.

314
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,892
I think he's just
making her laugh.

315
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,686
Time for me to find out.

316
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,816
Why is he making
her laugh so much?

317
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,693
Just going to
walk over here. Whoa!

318
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:24,321
I'm slipping and falling! I'm stumbling.
I need something to grab onto!

319
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,364
Hey, are you okay?
I'm fine.

320
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,699
Dwight! Dwight!
I'm totally fine!

321
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:27,783
Yes?

322
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,827
What? Jim?

323
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,120
Sorry about that.

324
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,581
Cramp. I'm just...
Dwight!

325
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,751
Why?

326
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,754
I'm sorry,
I fell down, Mr. Balance.

327
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,181
Leave.

328
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,978
Does your husband
ever have soft erections?

329
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:59,732
Because if not, I just grabbed
a very soft penis for nothing.

330
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,777
Why was he making
her laugh so much?

331
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,784
Hey, I'll just be a second.

332
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,660
Yeah, take your time.
Okay.

333
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,040
That line from Zoolander.
Mmm-hmm?

334
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,793
It was from a deleted scene
so we were both right.

335
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,127
Told you.

336
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,923
Do I hand in
my expense reports

337
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,382
to a particular
accountant or...

338
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,176
Oscar, Cathy
has a question.

339
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,054
Sorry, I'll just
go ask Oscar.

340
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,769
Yeah?
You okay?

341
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,771
Why won't you just admit
that she's attractive?

342
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,147
It's kind of annoying
that you won't say it.

343
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,024
Okay, what can I do
to make you believe me?

344
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,653
Well, Dwight had this idea and
I thought it was kind of crazy,

345
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,363
but maybe that's
where we are now.

346
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,535
She called it crazy? Man.

347
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,328
That's insulting.
All I did was

348
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,080
propose a makeshift
lie detector test.

349
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,040
Monitoring his
blood pressure, pulse,

350
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,959
perspiration and
breathing rate.

351
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,712
Yeah, it's nuts. But I
don't know what else to do.

352
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,090
And she called it nuts?

353
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,384
Seriously,
that was hot.

354
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,886
Feel like you and the
newsman had a groove going.

355
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,222
Did you know that Lisa
toured with Chaka Khan?

356
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,890
Are you serious?

357
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,433
From Star Trek?

358
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,060
Hey, you caught
some of that?

359
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,436
I caught it.

360
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,479
What, you don't like the Blues?

361
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,815
I might enjoy seeing
you guys play the Blues.

362
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:23,983
Well, we are playing.

363
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,652
We're all playing together.
These are our jam buddies.

364
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,405
It's a jam session. We go
where the music takes us.

365
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,908
I think the music
left without you.

366
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,707
Come on.
Stop shoving me.

367
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,751
"Stop shoving me. Stop
grabbing my penis." Grow up.

368
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,504
Take off your jacket
and take a seat.

369
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,551
When it lies, the human body
exhibits many telltale signs.

370
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,554
Really?
This could all go away

371
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,514
if you just
tell me the truth.

372
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,474
Are you all in line?

373
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,269
Why don't you go check out
the sympathy cards, old man?

374
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,105
Now I'm going to ask you
just a few simple questions.

375
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,483
Wait for this to
constrict. Here we go.

376
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,194
Is your name Jim Halpert?

377
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,778
Si.

378
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,699
Wait, that's it? That's the
question you're going to ask him?

379
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,242
We have to start
with a baseline question

380
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,660
to establish
what the truth is.

381
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:20,039
You have to share
the machine with others.

382
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,124
Well, that's
what they taught me

383
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,751
in my 19th
century kindergarten.

384
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,545
Okay, Dwight, come on.
You can go first.

385
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,547
Jim, are you serious?

386
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,429
You know what? This reminds
me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.

387
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,401
Maybe we could
switch instruments.

388
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,861
Yeah.

389
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,197
"Cause my body's
starting to get bruised.

390
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,659
Yeah, maybe everyone move
one instrument to the right.

391
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,510
We had to leave because
of creative differences.

392
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,137
Yeah, they kind of
had a specific sound

393
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,682
that didn't really
fit in with our thing.

394
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:24,603
Guys, this means they're
Kevin and the Zits now.

395
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,189
No, man. We are.

396
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,901
Well...
I know, I know.

397
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,820
Okay, you're done.

398
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,530
I have a new
heart, you know.

399
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,449
Do you really,
Tin Man? Okay.

400
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,660
Where were we?

401
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,203
No, I'm not worried.

402
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,164
Because this lie isn't
for me, it's for Pam.

403
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,584
And when she gets her body
back and her confidence back,

404
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,672
yes, I will tell
her the truth.

405
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,799
That...

406
00:18:54,383 --> 00:19:00,180
I had feelings for a co-worker
today that I haven't had in years.

407
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,601
In my defense,
he was grabbing my crotch

408
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,603
fairly aggressively
at the time.

409
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,647
Do you find
Cathy Simms attractive?

410
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,065
No.

411
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,653
Yep, he's lying.

412
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,613
See. Was that so hard?

413
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:17,990
I am not lying.

414
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,033
Really?

415
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,119
Pam, are you really going to
listen to his stupid homemade test?

416
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,662
I would listen to
my homemade test

417
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,205
because your husband
is definitely lying.

418
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,751
In fact, he's lied about every
question, even his name.

419
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,919
Who are you, really?
Wait, what?

420
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,298
Look at the numbers. Every single
time it's come up 150 over 100.

421
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,508
Your husband is
a pathological liar.

422
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,260
Jim, you have
high blood pressure.

423
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,137
He is definitely
attracted to her.

424
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,597
Doesn't your dad have
high blood pressure?

425
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:42,973
Yeah, but I don't smoke.

426
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,433
When was the last time
you went to the doctor?

427
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,310
I don't know. It's
important to go every month

428
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,811
and get your
prostate checked.

429
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:48,937
You can do it at
home by yourself

430
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,147
with your finger.
You just stick...

431
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,315
Okay.

432
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,566
Dwight, stop.

433
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,820
I'm not kidding. I mean, I need
you to take care of yourself.

434
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,238
What would we do if
something happened to you?

435
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,784
Okay, easy. Trust me.
I'm around for the long haul.

436
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,870
It's not really your choice, though,
is it? Death waits for no man.

437
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,246
Okay.

438
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,414
Come on, let's go.
I want to call your doctor.

439
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,169
Doesn't it worry you in the slightest
that Jim is not his real name?

440
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,295
Just go home,
it doesn't matter.

441
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,546
But the...

442
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,299
Hey, Cece's toothbrush.

443
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,970
Thank you.

444
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,973
Ooh,
baby, I love your way

445
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,309
Every day

446
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,855
Want to be
with you night and day

447
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,274
And day

448
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,277
Ooh, baby, I love your way
