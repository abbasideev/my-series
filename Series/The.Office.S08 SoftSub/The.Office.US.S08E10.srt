1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:04,921
Christmas time is here!

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,591
Wow! Thanks, guys.
That sounded amazing.

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:12,929
Hi, I'm Andy Bernard, and I
am the first office Santa ever

4
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,140
to make holiday
wishes come true.

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,434
Who's excited to get
their holiday wishes?

6
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:20,103
Holiday wishes.
What's that, Stanley?

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,064
We know exactly what
holiday you're referring to.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,861
It is important to be mindful of all
belief systems at our holiday party.

9
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,322
I've been here 18 years,
and I've suffered

10
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,574
through some weird
thematic Christmases.

11
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,077
A Honolulu Christmas,
a Pulp Fiction Christmas,

12
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,206
a Muslim Christmas,
Moroccan Christmas,

13
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,999
Mo Rocca Christmas.

14
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,167
I don't want it.

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,753
Christmas is Christmas
is Christmas is Christmas.

16
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:48,048
I got Stanley tickets to see
Lewis Black for his birthday.

17
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,551
Might not have
been the best idea.

18
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,887
I don't want no
Kwanzaa wreath.

19
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,640
I don't need a dreidel in
my face. That's its own thing.

20
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,558
And who's that
black Santa for?

21
00:00:58,808 --> 00:00:59,809
I don't care.

22
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,938
I know Santa ain't black.
I could care less.

23
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,024
I want Christmas.
Just give me plain

24
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,818
baby-Jesus-lying-in-a-manger
Christmas.

25
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,624
What is the status
on my wish? Fulfilled.

26
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,669
Brought my bicycle so I can be
your designated driver later,

27
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,297
in the event that you drink too
much, which is by no means required.

28
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,383
What about my wish that we
don't have to attend meetings

29
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,134
that degrade our
sense of adulthood?

30
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,386
That, I cannot do.

31
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,180
But I did get you an acre
of property on the moon.

32
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,516
Where, dark side
or light side?

33
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,060
Light side. Is it by
the Sea of Tranquillity?

34
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,604
As a matter of fact, yes.
Directly adjacent.

35
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,315
Beachfront.
Thank you, Andy.

36
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,360
So whose wish is next?
What about Santa's wish?

37
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,531
My biggest wish is that you
all get along well with Jessica.

38
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,035
Come on, guys, Jessica.

39
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,329
Jim, tell them who Jessica is.

40
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,081
She's not your grandmother,
is she?

41
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,000
Gam-Gam's
name is Ruth, Jim.

42
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,295
You should know. I introduced
you on speakerphone that time.

43
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,505
Jessica is my super
serious girlfriend,

44
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,216
who is seriously awesome
and seriously sexy.

45
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,303
Only thing that's not serious,
by the way, our repartee.

46
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,471
That's great.
When you know, you know.

47
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,973
Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man?

48
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,850
Totally out of your league.

49
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,185
So, in summation, ho ho ho,

50
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,979
please be nice to Jessica,
and mistletoe

51
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,814
is not an excuse
for sexual assault.

52
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,733
And don't go near Gam-Gam.

53
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,654
I love Jessica, and I
haven't even met her yet.

54
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,198
It's like, we don't
even need to meet, you know?

55
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,326
I already love you. Stay home.

56
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,912
I just want you to
know that I will be mean

57
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,164
to Jessica,
if you want me to be.

58
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,540
Oh, no, no, it's fine, Kelly.

59
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,001
It's really no problem. I was already
planning on being mean to her.

60
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,294
That's okay,
I don't want you to do that.

61
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,463
Hello.

62
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,299
Merry Christmas, Erin.

63
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,010
Kelly, happy Pancha Ganapati.

64
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,136
Ew. What is that?

65
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,972
The five day Hindu
celebration in December,

66
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,892
honoring the god Ganesh,
patron of the arts.

67
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,685
Cool.

68
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,395
Hey, man.
Hey.

69
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,105
How you holding up?

70
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,858
Because of your
wife leaving you.

71
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,109
Kevin.

72
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,695
I actually appreciate
the human intimacy.

73
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,031
I feel like a kitten
being cradled by a gorilla.

74
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,157
Yeah.

75
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,993
It's been 10 days since
I had sexual intercourse.

76
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,621
Well, you came to
the right place.

77
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,415
It... This party
will cheer you right up.

78
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,460
I hope so. The corporate
party was wretched.

79
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:34,214
I am so tired of
the Black Eyed Peas.

80
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,383
It's rock and roll for people
who don't like rock and roll.

81
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,802
It's rap for people
who don't like rap.

82
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,471
It's pop for people
who don't like pop.

83
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,473
Ah.

84
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,225
Heartbreaking.

85
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,434
Oh. Thank you.

86
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:55,610
Well, I hate to have to take my Santa
hat off and put on my hard ass hat,

87
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,905
but this is serious.

88
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,742
It's come to my attention that
somebody who shall remain nameless

89
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,702
wants to switch desk clumps.

90
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,539
Fine with me. Jim can
leave any time he wants.

91
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,790
Good-bye.
Wasn't me.

92
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,208
It wasn't either of you.

93
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,876
Cathy wants to
leave our clump?

94
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,922
Don't look.
Who it was is not important.

95
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,591
But she did say that
your constant pranking

96
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,010
and one-upsmanship
is driving her crazy.

97
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,180
She or he. I just want
to say this is not my fault.

98
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,474
Okay, the weak
always bully the strong,

99
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,184
contrary to what
you see in the media.

100
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,395
I am always
acting in self-defense.

101
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,730
Occasionally
preemptive self-defense.

102
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,400
Ow! What are you doing?
Hey! Hey!

103
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,818
Respect the hat.

104
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,987
Pam never seemed
to have a problem with us.

105
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,824
All right. I'm gonna speak in a
language you both understand.

106
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,451
Moe-nay.

107
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,536
What was it?
What is it?

108
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,037
Money.

109
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,875
You both have sizable Christmas
bonuses coming your way.

110
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,460
If I catch either of you
messing with the other,

111
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,670
I will give both
bonuses to the other person.

112
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,298
Can't do that.
No, absolutely not.

113
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:02,135
You need consequences. Okay, I
want you both walking on eggshells.

114
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,391
Hi, I'm Jessica.
I'm looking for Andy.

115
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,978
Jessica, yes.
We don't say hi. We hug.

116
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,400
I'm Erin. Sorry.
Ooh!

117
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,235
I hope you feel really
welcome. We all want you here.

118
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,361
Oh.

119
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,072
My ex is meeting my sex.

120
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,783
Which is always scary.

121
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,621
You know? And not just because you
think they might talk about your penis.

122
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,873
That's just part of it.

123
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,042
Hey! Jess, Erin.

124
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,627
I hope you're not
talking about my penis.

125
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,878
Hi.

126
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,923
Hey, everyone,
I want you to meet Jessica.

127
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,092
She is an assistant
cross-country coach at Bryn Mawr.

128
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,427
Wow.

129
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,472
Erin, by the way,
amazing receptionist.

130
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,517
Oh, that's great.
Backbone of the office.

131
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,602
Which is funny, actually,
because my spine is a mess.

132
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,728
What?

133
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:57,982
Scoliosis. Had to wear a back
brace for three years, but I never did.

134
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,779
Oh, no.

135
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,822
Oh, no, it's kicking in.

136
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,366
Spontaneous scoliosis.

137
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,992
Spontaneous scoliosis.

138
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,038
Oh.

139
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,457
This thing could take
your arm off, your head off.

140
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,875
You know,
just exercise caution.

141
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,085
Thank you.
All right.

142
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,503
All right.

143
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,880
Oh, yeah,

144
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,758
and there's a Christmas party upstairs
tonight I wanted to tell you about.

145
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,552
Isn't that just
for popsicles?

146
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,886
Popsicles?

147
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,389
Yeah, like, upstairs people.
"Cause you got a stick up your butt.

148
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,850
Ah. See, I thought it was
because they're all so rich

149
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,228
they could eat popsicles
all the time.

150
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,480
What?
I... In my...

151
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,024
Well, you should definitely
come. The foreman always comes.

152
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:43,361
Plus it's fun, you know,
cookies, smoked fish,

153
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,363
alcohol, people acting stupid.

154
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,700
You had me at "clookies." I
can't wait to find out what they are.

155
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,119
What should I wear?

156
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,580
Oh, it's nice. It's real nice.
People get dressed up.

157
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,499
I will look so
handsome for you, Darryl.

158
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,467
Uh...

159
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,846
I'm gonna...

160
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,853
Dwight really wants my bonus.

161
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,355
He's trying to entrap me.

162
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,859
Oh, God, now I can't
drink at this thing.

163
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,113
I get really
pranky when I drink.

164
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,282
Erin, what can I get for you?

165
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,035
Do you have cola?
Kirkland, if you have it.

166
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,995
Why would you come to a bar
and ask for a cola

167
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,997
when you can get
some from the kitchen?

168
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,500
Did some small part of you
want something a little stronger?

169
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,380
Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar,
come and take these shots.

170
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,798
Yes!

171
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,050
Will do.

172
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,720
The fifth one is for you, Erin.
You can take it or leave it.

173
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,556
To take it would be
to accept that you're

174
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,516
at a party,
and you're an adult woman

175
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,519
and you have
an adventurous spirit.

176
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,188
To leave it
would be fine, too.

177
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,565
One, two, three.
Yes.

178
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,900
Okay.

179
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:05,902
Wow!

180
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,570
Whoo!
Hey, hey, nice.

181
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,989
Jiminy Christmas!

182
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,116
Jiminy Christmas, indeed.

183
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,577
Hit her up.
Oh, yes.

184
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,579
- Yeah.
- Wow!

185
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,709
Yeah, I just got my
replacement credit card.

186
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,923
Do you want the number?
Oh, it's 4-7-9-3

187
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:31,844
0-0-3-2-3-3-1-3.

188
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,432
The security code is 9-2-7.

189
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,434
Okay, great,
thank you very much.

190
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,936
Bye.

191
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,441
So Dwight did take the bait.

192
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:51,406
He used my credit card numbers
to send a $200 bouquet of flowers

193
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,700
to my wife.

194
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,159
From me.

195
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,708
Boom!

196
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,961
Look,
it's Christmas, so you're allowed...

197
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,879
Hello.

198
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,557
I meant dressed up
compared to normal.

199
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,475
You usually dress
like a Ghostbuster.

200
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,519
Okay. I thought
you'd wear a sweater.

201
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,271
Since when does a sweater
mean "dressed up"?

202
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,355
Am I your grandson?

203
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,481
Come on, stay, all right?

204
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,941
It's good for people
to get to know you.

205
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,111
As a contestant on
Dancing with the Stars maybe.

206
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:35,324
I want my sugar-free cookie,
and then I want a sugar cookie.

207
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,660
And then I want my nap.

208
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,245
That's right.

209
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,330
Thank you.

210
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,124
She is remarkable.

211
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,626
Edgy impressions.
Thank you.

212
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,670
How many drinks
have you had tonight?

213
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,297
I can't be
driving everybody home.

214
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,424
A thousand.
Woah!

215
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,010
Maybe you should take a break.

216
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,554
Maybe you should
mind your own business.

217
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,682
Just kidding.

218
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,979
Ah! I've been attacked!

219
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,149
Oh, my God. Someone put
a porcupine in my drawer.

220
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,609
Oh, my God.

221
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,862
Yeah, I was just sitting here at my
desk, and I reached into my drawer

222
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,239
to grab my toothbrush
and some tooth powder,

223
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,450
and all of a sudden,
I was attacked

224
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,702
by this bloodthirsty
rabid creature.

225
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:23,372
I wonder, in this office,
who has access to a porcupine?

226
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,709
Or who in this office
knows that I have access

227
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,628
and is trying to set me up?

228
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,672
Hmm. You know, this
sounds a lot like the premise

229
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,758
of my latest Chad
Flenderman novel,

230
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,510
A Murder for Framing.

231
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,471
Chad Flenderman. Just an
easy-going black guy who knows

232
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,765
the streets,
yet he also went to Oxford.

233
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:46,938
So just as comfortable on a
motorcycle as he is on Air Force One.

234
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,359
And he's also the world's
leading Egyptologist.

235
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:56,280
Toby, nobody cares about
your sex-crazed black detective.

236
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,408
No, no, no, no, no, women
chase him. He misses his wife.

237
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,744
Hello, lacerated
hand here, folks.

238
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,079
Nice try.
This is ridiculous.

239
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,330
Oh, is it really?

240
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,624
Two separate times
you have set me up to believe

241
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,709
that I was being
recruited by the CIA.

242
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,670
Three times, actually.
You see?

243
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,129
Jim, this has your
fingerprints all over it.

244
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,297
Andy, you've got
to be kidding me.

245
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,550
Fingerprints can be planted.

246
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:16,843
You know,
with a severed hand...

247
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,052
Do you think
that's what happened?

248
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,303
Do you think he
used a severed hand?

249
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,722
Okay, you know what, why
don't we just call Animal Control?

250
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,433
You might want to run that
by Angela. 'Cause it's so cute.

251
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:28,312
No. Porcupines don't have
souls. They're like dogs.

252
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,355
Yes, I'm calling
from Dunder Mifflin.

253
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,191
We have a very rabid
porcupine in our office.

254
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,442
Someone should
come pick it up.

255
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,610
Come down right away.

256
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,779
I don't know, let me ask.
Were you quilled?

257
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:37,864
Yes, I was quilled.

258
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,323
And what's its name?
Henrietta.

259
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,449
Oh.

260
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,243
What? Uh...

261
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,246
All right. Get her
out of here, Dwight.

262
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,549
Hey.

263
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,302
Guys, I just wanted to say...
Come here.

264
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,222
I am so happy you
guys are together. Okay?

265
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,808
And you both have
such beautiful hair.

266
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,894
Thank you.

267
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,979
I hope you guys get married.

268
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,566
And who knows? Maybe at
the wedding, I meet someone.

269
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:14,942
Okay.

270
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,070
And later on tonight,
I hope I see you guys kiss.

271
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,159
Yay.

272
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,745
Okay, well, I'm gonna go do
another reverse spit.

273
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,332
That's how the cool
kids say "get a drink."

274
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,713
That's...
That's the girl you dated?

275
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,884
Yeah, she's not always
like that. It's...

276
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,303
No, she seems fun.

277
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,640
Yeah, excuse me.
Okay.

278
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,517
Hey.

279
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,437
Have you had anything to eat
besides candy canes?

280
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,939
Every martini has an olive.

281
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,231
Okay.

282
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,776
Maybe I should make you
some oatmeal or something.

283
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,695
I don't want to put you out, but
if someone's making oatmeal,

284
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,030
I'll take an apple cinnamon

285
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,116
and a maple brown sugar
in one bowl! with whole milk.

286
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,202
Hey, I never told
you my Christmas wish.

287
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,995
Okay.
It's about you.

288
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:12,208
That's not what it should be. It should
just be like a trinket or something.

289
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,711
It's that I wish
Jessica was dead.

290
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,715
You mean you wish
she wasn't here or something.

291
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,803
I wish she was in a graveyard
under the ground

292
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,180
with worms coming
out of her mouth.

293
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,309
Hey, you know,
you can't say that, okay?

294
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,728
That's my girlfriend
that you're talking about.

295
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,147
You and I are not
together anymore.

296
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,693
You need to get over it.
Take your wish back.

297
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,654
Too late.
It's already been wished.

298
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,408
And you promised it would come
true. You wrote it in an e-mail!

299
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,704
So which one are you,
a murderer or a liar?

300
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,089
Hey.

301
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,341
So there was talk of oatmeal.

302
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,266
You know, don't listen
to what anyone is saying.

303
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,060
You look like a princess.

304
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,021
Yeah.
Thanks.

305
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,941
I was too embarrassed.

306
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,778
Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt.
I just found this on my desk

307
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,780
and need to talk to
somebody about it.

308
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,323
Can you believe that?

309
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,284
Is that Cece?
Yes, it is.

310
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,119
Oh, man.
That's awful.

311
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,787
Cece is Jim's daughter.

312
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,039
Oh, my God.

313
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,540
How could somebody do that?

314
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,791
I know. I mean,
the way I see it is,

315
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,084
you can deface
any picture of me.

316
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,794
Any one. Pick one.
Not my kid, though.

317
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,296
Who did this?
Who did this?

318
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,547
Do you know who did this?
I don't...

319
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,175
I know who did this. Dwight.

320
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,468
Dwight?
Yeah, he did.

321
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,552
What? No.
He should pay.

322
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,471
He is gonna pay.
This is fire-able.

323
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,972
- Okay.
- It's... I mean...

324
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,098
Let me just see
it one more time.

325
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:55,227
You know what?
I know who my friends are now.

326
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,645
But I shouldn't
have got you involved.

327
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,065
Because the truth is, I don't
even really care about this picture.

328
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,399
It's a little out of focus.

329
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,984
It was probably an accident,
right? Like...

330
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,360
That's no accident.

331
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,989
Right. You're right. So maybe it
was me who did it. By accident.

332
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,200
What?
I'll figure it out.

333
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,161
Get to the bottom of it.
Merry merry.

334
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,832
Enough of this garbage.

335
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,920
This is Christmas.

336
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,246
Christmas!

337
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,086
You all right, Santa?

338
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,546
You know those
movies where two friends

339
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,381
are sleeping
together and it's like,

340
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,008
hey, can they stay friends?

341
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,176
Yes.

342
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,218
Do you think two
friends who are

343
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,595
not sleeping
together can stay friends?

344
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,014
Two friends who are
not sleeping together,

345
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,891
can they remain friends?
Yes, yeah.

346
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,560
No. I... I don't know.

347
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,811
Okay.
By the way,

348
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,105
I'm not gonna mess with
your and Dwight's bonuses.

349
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,274
I think it's
causing more problems.

350
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,151
So just be yourselves,
have fun,

351
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,111
and try not to let
it affect your work.

352
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,071
All right.
I will definitely do that.

353
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,406
All right. I'll tell Dwight.

354
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,117
You know what?
You're sitting and thinking.

355
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,120
And it's probably better
if it comes from me anyway.

356
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,372
Christmas miracles do happen.

357
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,499
Yes, they totally do.

358
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,295
You can't click on
these Kardashian links.

359
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,880
That's why you
have so many viruses.

360
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,173
Well, help me, okay?

361
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,299
I'm trying, but...

362
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,383
You need to...
Kelly.

363
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,636
Yo. On it
Game on.

364
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:42,061
I don't know what I was
thinking, it was awful. Awful.

365
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,646
Jessica, did you just fart?

366
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,151
And that is how it's done.

367
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,403
I would like another alcohol.

368
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,740
Let's you and I take a walk.
Oscar, you're in charge of the bar.

369
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,368
What? I haven't
bartended in forever.

370
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,454
Never considered
myself a mixologist.

371
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,875
Oh, this is daunting. Um, I
need a mortar, pestle, muddler.

372
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,794
Does anyone have any
chocolate shavings?

373
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,922
Your heart is broken.

374
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,840
So's mine.
And?

375
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,759
And what?

376
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,053
And do you have any
advice or anything...

377
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,514
Oh, my God.
...to help me feel better?

378
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,182
I've been married thrice,
and each

379
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,601
has ended in
an acrimonious divorce.

380
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,145
I'm not sure I'm the best
person to give love advice.

381
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,024
I was hoping you were going
to make me feel better.

382
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,904
When you do your makeup, how
long does it take usually? "Cause...

383
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,239
It depends.

384
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,033
Chad Flenderman's
kryptonite...

385
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,201
Woah.

386
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,287
We got a real
Clarence Thomas here.

387
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:45,874
Hi.

388
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,795
I'll see you at home.
Okay. Okay, great.

389
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,213
Perfect.
Bye.

390
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,924
I still don't
get why you can't

391
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,301
just call her
a cab and pay for it.

392
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,013
I would, it just...
That wasn't the holiday wish.

393
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:03,309
Either he drives or I drive,
and now I'm drunk and mad.

394
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,395
Okay, bye.
Okay, bye.

395
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,481
All right, come on, Meredith.

396
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,026
Bye. Thank you, Santa.

397
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,527
You bet.

398
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,738
Thank God Erin's getting
a ride home with Robert,

399
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,406
"cause she is trashed.

400
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,991
And who better to drive
her home than Robert?

401
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,036
I mean, what
a stand up guy, you know.

402
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,122
I mean, he's going through a
lot. Separating from his wife,

403
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,917
showing up at the Christmas
party in a track suit and a blazer.

404
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,964
Let's go, let's go. MEREDITH:
I'm coming, I'm coming.

405
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,716
I'm coming, I'm coming.

406
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,426
Hang on.
All right.

407
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,096
Woah! My stuff!
What? What is all that?

408
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,389
It's my valuables!

409
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,599
It's junk.

410
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,267
This is my treasures.
No, they're my treasures!

411
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,602
You're a hoarder. My God!

412
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,687
No, I'm not!
I'm gonna sell it on eBay!

413
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,439
No, no, no, you be careful.

414
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,275
Be careful!
Ah! My Santa suit's stuck.

415
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,284
What are we gonna do with all
that bonus money, Henrietta, huh?

416
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,828
Where are we?
This ain't my street.

417
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,333
Oh. This is the posh
part of town, huh?

418
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,837
Oh, my God.

419
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,217
Wonder what a studio condo
would cost in this neighborhood.

420
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,761
Meredith, shut your
drunk hole right now.

421
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,808
Erin, it was
great fun tonight.

422
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:30,270
Take a few aspirin, drink a whole
lot of water, sleep in in the morning.

423
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,983
Thank you. Good night.

424
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,615
What are you smiling for?

425
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,034
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

426
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,038
I'm sure I am not.

427
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,332
Let's get you home.

428
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,751
Ow!

429
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,421
Take it easy!

430
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,262
Oh, man!

431
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,098
Fell asleep. Took a nap.

432
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,351
Hey, guys.
I feel refreshed now.

433
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,145
How's it going?
Dwight.

434
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:15,524
Took a little nap right next to
Jim's desk. I feel so good right now.

435
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,151
Mmm. Cookies.

436
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,236
What's everyone staring at?

437
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,115
Oh, man! I was supposed
to tell Dwight something.

438
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,493
Come on, Jim.

439
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,955
I got nothing.
