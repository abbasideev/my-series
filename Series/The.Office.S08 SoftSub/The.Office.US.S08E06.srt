1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,799
Hey, everybody! It's closing time!

2
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,719
You don't gotta go home,
but you can't stay here.

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,852
Closing time!

4
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,522
Every office needs an
end-of-the-day tradition.

5
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,649
Something to tell you
the day's over.

6
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,194
Otherwise, you go home and
the night just feels like more day.

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,320
It's weird.

8
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,613
Closing time!

9
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:30,947
W, R, K.

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,782
One last call
for alcohol so...

11
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,035
No, it's W, R, K,
as in kitten?

12
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,369
...So finish your
whiskey or beer!

13
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,621
Oh, my boss is
singing Closing Time,

14
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,914
maybe that's
what you're hearing.

15
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:39,998
Come on, Pam!

16
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,750
Closing time!

17
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:48,715
Time for you to go home
to the places you will be from

18
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,136
Let's see, Andy has been
manager for 105 days,

19
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:58,308
which means I've heard
Closing Time 105 times.

20
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,061
Still don't know the words.

21
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,440
Home and home and home

22
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:10,820
I know who I want
to take me home!

23
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:15,784
I know who I want
lo take me home

24
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,122
I know who I want
lo take me home

25
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,041
Take me home

26
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,630
You know what? Fine! I try to
start fun traditions for you guys,

27
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,299
but if you don't want
to sing, no traditions!

28
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,469
Closing time!

29
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,013
Every new beginning...

30
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:41,643
I never heard that song before and
once I heard it, I did not care for it.

31
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,521
But that song means
it's time to go home.

32
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,440
Now, it's my favorite song.

33
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:54,990
Every new beginning comes
from some other beginning's end

34
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,700
Good night!

35
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,608
This report is atrocious.
Who's your favorite Iron Chef?

36
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,527
You go first.

37
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,407
The ticketing software
paints a picture

38
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,494
of a sloppy, careless,
error-prone office.

39
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,248
Well, the monitoring software
is a double-edged sword.

40
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,624
Sometimes the...

41
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,917
Sorry. Go ahead.

42
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,753
Mmm-hmm.

43
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,757
Did you need
something from us?

44
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,925
Yes.

45
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,305
Your attention,
because...

46
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,934
No. That is all.

47
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,152
Last night, I dreamed
that the number two

48
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,613
was the most valued
number in the world.

49
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,282
The Vice President
had all the power,

50
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,785
athletes fought
for silver medals,

51
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,037
women were considered
the best gender.

52
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:28,249
And stadiums of fans shouted,
"We're number two!"

53
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,629
As with all my dreams,
I'm guessing

54
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,881
it was about
my fear of immigrants.

55
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,384
Last week, an accounting
mistake resulted in

56
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,219
a client getting
their order for free.

57
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,721
Ohh! That's not good.

58
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,307
Chalk that one up to "Tweedle-Dee"
and "Tweedle-Dum" out there.

59
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,643
Who are they?
They're both Kevin.

60
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,728
Oscar's the
Sex and the City gang,

61
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,730
and Angela, if you can...

62
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,900
Andy, sometimes I feel
like you don't know me at all.

63
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,318
I would agree with that.

64
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,821
Simply end the mistakes.

65
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,406
End the mistakes. Easy.

66
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,576
When I come back next week, and
this report shows me "No mistakes,"

67
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,454
we can talk
about names all day.

68
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,249
Our favorite names,
silly made-up names,

69
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,669
normal names said in a silly
voice. Wouldn't that be nice?

70
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,504
I would like that.

71
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,214
End the mistakes.

72
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,174
That's all I ask.

73
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,845
And you can't have
a favorite Iron Chef.

74
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,973
It depends entirely on
the secret ingredient.

75
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:29,519
Sometimes I feel you
don't know food at all.

76
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,775
I'm just saying,
with the NBA lockout,

77
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,944
I think roller derby's in a
really good place right now.

78
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:41,698
So, my pitch is, me, Pam,
you and someone else,

79
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,408
maybe Justine...

80
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,994
No. Not Justine.

81
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,704
Never Justine.

82
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,080
Is that off again?

83
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,248
Oh, yeah.
Okay.

84
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,376
Hey, mandatory warehouse
safety meeting today.

85
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,254
We don't really do those.
We just sign the thing.

86
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,256
Are you really this lazy?

87
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,509
I'll be there.

88
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,387
Hey.

89
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,182
Mondays suck!

90
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,683
Yeah. Yep.

91
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,396
Just trying to...

92
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:19,736
I may have a little solution
to our mistakes problem.

93
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,031
This is a project I've been
working on for quite some time.

94
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,158
And today might be
the day to use it.

95
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,284
What've you got?

96
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,161
Allow me.

97
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,750
You're gonna love this.

98
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,794
Should've used
a shorter string.

99
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,129
Never mind,
I know it by heart.

100
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,467
It is a system that holds people
accountable for everyone else's work.

101
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,010
Sounds controversial.

102
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,970
Have I not been
worthy of your trust?

103
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,098
Have I not been
a reliable number two?

104
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,059
Do not go there.

105
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,312
You're the deuce
I never want to drop.

106
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,856
Well, I can make this work.

107
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,900
I'll set it up right now.
I just need your go ahead.

108
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,861
Go do the voodoo
that you do so well!

109
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:02,987
I will do my voodoo.

110
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,239
Mmm-hmm.

111
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,283
Hey. I need you to get
the paperwork rolling

112
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,118
on a new
workplace relationship.

113
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,203
For you?

114
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,246
Yes, for Gabe.

115
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,497
Who are you seeing?
That's great.

116
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,959
Whom I am seeing is Val,
from down in the warehouse.

117
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,586
I'm not technically
seeing her,

118
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,713
but, I've seen
her with the eyes.

119
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,092
And there was attraction in
at least one direction, SO...

120
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,639
You know, I don't have to do
paperwork unless you're actually dating.

121
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,517
Okay. Well, once this starts,
it's gonna be moving fast,

122
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,143
it's gonna be hot and heavy,
and I don't want

123
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,728
a bunch of
bureaucratic red tape

124
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,272
wrapped around my jock,
you know?

125
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,857
But I mean, well,
have you talked to her?

126
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,694
Yeah. We had a whole
conversation about Mondays.

127
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,280
Do you know
her last name yet?

128
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,365
Toby, I'm gonna tell you
her last name tomorrow,

129
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,409
because she's gonna be
screaming it tonight.

130
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,411
She's gonna be screaming
her own last name?

131
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,371
Hey, watch it.

132
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,040
Good luck, Gabe.

133
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,500
Hi, guys.
Hi.

134
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:01,754
I just wanna say that you all have
been doing amazing work, really.

135
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,631
Thank you.
And I'd like to add

136
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,550
that your work has
been a little sloppy.

137
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,344
So, Dwight and I
have implemented

138
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,139
a new program that
we like to call...

139
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:12,932
...Dwight?

140
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,225
The Accountability Booster.

141
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,770
It registers every time a mistake
has been made in the office,

142
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,690
from a late delivery,
to an accounting error.

143
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,193
Five strikes in a day
equals a home run.

144
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,029
One home run
and you're out.

145
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,866
If we as a group make
five mistakes in a day,

146
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,369
something bad happens.
Like, we block Minesweeper!

147
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,289
Or, in this case, an e-mail
gets sent to Robert California

148
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,124
containing the consultant's
report from last year.

149
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,543
Remember the one that
recommended the branch be shut down?

150
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,712
What?
And, as a failsafe, also,

151
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,882
every negative e-mail you've
ever written about him to the group

152
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,091
will also be
forwarded to him.

153
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,509
What e-mails are
you talking about?

154
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:52,930
Robert's favorite songs, Creep
by TLC, Creep by Radiohead.

155
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,557
You remember that one, Jim?

156
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,852
"There's no way he hasn't
strangled at least one stripper."

157
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,103
Oscar.

158
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,982
"He eats his yogurt like he is
punishing it for disappointing him."

159
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,150
Kelly.

160
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,234
That's not that
bad, actually.

161
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,070
PS, "We should
kill him."

162
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,698
Wait. So, you installed
a doomsday device?

163
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,492
No, it's an
Accountability Booster.

164
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,661
Which, when it goes off,
it destroys everything,

165
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,079
very similar to
a doomsday device.

166
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,998
Jim, you're trying to make me
sound like some kind of evil maniac.

167
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,043
No, the point is, is that we are
now working in an environment

168
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,421
where we have
accountability to each other.

169
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,299
I am confident that you
guys are equal to the task.

170
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,345
No, we're not. And you are a
psycho who is ruining our lives.

171
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,097
We can't do this, Dwight.
We can't.

172
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,766
Smile.

173
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,810
Nod. Smile and nod.

174
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,187
They're making me out
to be a Bond villain.

175
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,940
I like to think of myself
as a brilliant scientist

176
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,818
who will stop at nothing
to remake the world.

177
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,486
Like...

178
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,448
Not Doctor Moreau,
someone good.

179
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,077
Doctor Frankenstein.

180
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,121
Doctor Jekyll, not them.

181
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,624
Doctor...

182
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,171
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

183
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,258
I mean, the thing about this
office is, we make a lot of mistakes.

184
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,427
But the device
will change that.

185
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,846
Without a safety net,
people will improve.

186
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,644
All right, everybody, looks like
we need to be getting to work.

187
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,522
Be extra careful,
double-check everything.

188
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,691
Or the Accountability Booster
will get you.

189
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:30,069
This doomsday device
sounds like a scare tactic to me.

190
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,739
There's an easy way to tell
if this device is a sham,

191
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,699
we just make a mistake.

192
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,286
I'll send an order down to shipping
before we've received payment.

193
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,420
There's one mistake.

194
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,505
Now we only have four
strikes left until a home run.

195
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,674
Dwight's our co-worker
and he worked really hard

196
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,134
on this doomsday
device. So, I...

197
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,762
It's not a doomsday
device! Gosh!

198
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,514
We can do this, you guys.

199
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,183
First!

200
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,768
Second!
It's not a race.

201
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,438
Third!

202
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,315
Who knows
what the belt is for?

203
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,775
It's for
protecting my ass

204
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,526
when you suckers lift
more than you can handle.

205
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,986
What's up? I'm Gabe.

206
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,030
Corporate. Continue.

207
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,490
Don't be nervous.

208
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,033
Apparently,
we have a visitor.

209
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,117
Gabe, everyone.

210
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,368
Hi, Gabe!

211
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,914
All right, so the support
belt. Now this one is mine.

212
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,707
Doesn't get much
use nowadays.

213
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,626
Look at this.
This is enormous.

214
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,216
I get the sense that Val
enjoys a good put-down.

215
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,218
Considering that's the
only thing I know about her,

216
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,720
I will be milking that hard.

217
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,223
It's like a hula-hoop,
right?

218
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,143
Mele Kalikimaka
is Hawaii's way

219
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:47,980
You done?

220
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,733
The Michelin Man called,
he wants his cummerbund back.

221
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,196
Remember, we have to get
Regal Escrow their refund by 5:00.

222
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,614
I'm on it!

223
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,908
Kevin, maybe I
should handle that.

224
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,869
We really need you to
focus on your project.

225
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,329
Good thinking.

226
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,415
Apparently, a big
client for this company

227
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,585
needs to know the story
of how paper gets made.

228
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,799
Oscar, use a calculator.

229
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,223
When the stakes are this high
there's only one computer that I trust.

230
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,601
And it's powered by
Thai food and Spanish reds.

231
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,395
All right, everybody,
you're doing great.

232
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,356
Well, I wouldn't say that. Three
mistakes already is pretty terrible.

233
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,649
But I do see
improvement.

234
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,442
Meredith kept someone
on hold for 30 minutes,

235
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,570
and now look,
she's hard at work.

236
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,030
Dwight, question.
No questions.

237
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,615
If this doomsday
device goes off...

238
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,783
Accountability Booster.

239
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:41,993
If this bad idea goes off

240
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,537
and we all lose our jobs, are
you gonna feel good about that?

241
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,913
I haven't even
considered it.

242
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:49,375
That's how sure I am that this
Accountability Booster is gonna work.

243
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,502
Try "Mose-1-2-3-4."

244
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,754
Dwight would never be that
obvious. Try something like...

245
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,716
<i>"Z-6-4-3-8"</i>

246
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,719
Not that exactly, Jim,
something like that.

247
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,761
Okay.

248
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,389
How about
"Scranton-Strangler-6-6-6"?

249
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,808
No?
Nope.

250
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,059
Aw...

251
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,644
Shoot.

252
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,355
You guys are never gonna
shut down the machine, okay?

253
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,691
But I appreciate your energy
and your teamwork.

254
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,443
You apply this to
your regular work,

255
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,069
you won't even notice
that the device is there,

256
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,571
watching you,
ready to strike.

257
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,366
What's Dwight's
mother's name?

258
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,160
Hedda.

259
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,872
No.

260
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,999
Once you've read
the packet, sign the back.

261
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,751
Hey, Darryl.
I was thinking,

262
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,169
maybe while we
read through this,

263
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,712
you could grab us
all some coffee?

264
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,339
My treat.

265
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,466
Here's a $100 bill.

266
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,134
That should cover it,
I think.

267
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,470
Don't bring me any of that
caramel soy latte crap, okay?

268
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,847
I want a decaf
frappuccino.

269
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:45,932
Val?

270
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,017
Actually, Val,
why don't you come with?

271
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,019
I'll need the extra hands
to carry them back.

272
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,103
Yeah, sure.

273
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,313
Mmm-hmm.

274
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,649
Caramel soy latte.

275
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,816
No, a decaf frap.

276
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,109
Got it.

277
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,615
You sent the late notice to
Rinehart and Wolfe, right?

278
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,367
Mmm-hmm. 64620.

279
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,203
67620.

280
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,955
Nuh-uh.
Yes!

281
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,998
588 plus 15%...

282
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,711
- Oh, no!
- What does this mean?

283
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,630
- What does it mean?
- Andy.

284
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,965
Oh!

285
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,509
God!

286
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:22,969
That's five strikes.

287
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,637
Well,

288
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,891
I was saving this for my
retirement which I guess is today.

289
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,184
Dwight, we got
five strikes.

290
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,895
Really?

291
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,146
Did the e-mail
go out or...

292
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,690
It goes out
automatically at 5:00 p.m.

293
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,775
Well, then there's
gotta be a way to stop it.

294
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,403
Well, I would have to enter my
password in order to cancel it.

295
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,904
Okay!

296
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,365
Dwight, you may now
enter your password.

297
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:45,992
No.

298
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,159
What?
What?

299
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,078
You don't deserve
to have this branch.

300
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,872
Five mistakes in
less than a day?

301
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,165
We did our best.

302
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,001
No, you didn't, Phyllis.

303
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,502
You complained
the whole time,

304
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,879
you yelled at me, you tried
to break into the machine.

305
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,173
What?

306
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,050
You're a real crumb bum,
you know that?

307
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,136
Hey, you can't
just change the rules

308
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,179
because you don't
like the outcome.

309
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,974
What about you, Kevin? What
about you and your fake task?

310
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,101
Can you tell me now
where paper comes from?

311
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,604
The man tree
puts its penis...

312
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,690
Okay. All right, Andy,
back me up here, please.

313
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,774
No.

314
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,026
No!
What?

315
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,778
Dwight, be human for once,
shut down the machine.

316
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,655
Shut it down!
Shut it down.

317
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,032
Shut down the machine!

318
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,366
Shut it down!

319
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,620
Good luck finding
a new job, idiots.

320
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,290
I'll make sure to write
you a glowing reference.

321
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,125
Glowingly negative!

322
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,087
Dwight's car is gone.

323
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:41,714
I bet he went home.

324
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,592
Some of us should go there,
try to talk some sense into him.

325
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,469
Get him to stop that e-mail.

326
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,472
Pam, you should come with
me. Dwight really likes you,

327
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,557
and your breasts are
enormous, that could help us.

328
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,809
Kevin has that lovability.

329
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,770
Guys, come on!

330
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,229
I'm right here.

331
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,149
Jim, I want you to go find
Robert. Just be where he is,

332
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,610
in case that e-mail
goes out at 5:00,

333
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,987
you can try to
delete it or something.

334
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,238
Okay. Where is he?

335
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,492
He's at some club where you
either eat squash or play squash.

336
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,369
I'll try both.

337
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,580
Oh.

338
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,832
Did you come to
reason with me?

339
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,459
Got you something.

340
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,675
And I just really
want to talk to you.

341
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,135
Get lost.

342
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,762
Well, now hold on...

343
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:30,888
What are you doing?

344
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,474
What does it
look like I'm doing?

345
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,017
Digging a grave
for a horse.

346
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,396
Do you need a hand?

347
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,691
Yeah, you need a hand?

348
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,076
If you hit another horse,
you've dug too far.

349
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,954
I'll see you
next week, Will.

350
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,372
Robert!

351
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,749
Jim, what are you...

352
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,875
What a surprise!

353
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,837
Yeah. Well, you know, I just
had a meeting, a squash meeting.

354
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,046
Yeah?

355
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,423
You up for a game?

356
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,883
A game? Or a match?

357
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,803
Exactly! Here we go.

358
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,054
Let's do it.

359
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,811
Are you okay, Kevin?

360
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,315
Where are you going?

361
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,859
In. I'm hungry.

362
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,695
Could we come in, too?
Just for some water?

363
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,905
Okay. Take off your shoes.

364
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,032
Except you, Kevin.
They stay on.

365
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,246
Wow, I forgot how
pretty your house is.

366
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,458
This is the newest addition,
built by Erasmus Schrute in 1808.

367
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,628
It doubled as a tuberculosis
recovery room until 2009.

368
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,133
That's too much doodle,
and not enough lab.

369
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,969
Yeah, when are they gonna
do a Labradoodle that's just lab?

370
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,929
That's what I'm saying.

371
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,435
Hey.

372
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,812
You're welcome.
Thanks for the coffee.

373
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,481
So, tonight I was thinking,
I'm gonna go to the cemetery,

374
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,858
I'm gonna drink
a little wine,

375
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,776
and I thought maybe
you'd like to come with me.

376
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,987
Are you asking me
on a date?

377
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,906
Yes, I am.

378
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,449
Because I don't
date coworkers.

379
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,910
It's not personal.
It's a matter of policy.

380
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,369
I could quit.

381
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,454
Problem solved.

382
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,914
Don't quit.

383
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,918
Good policy.
It's sensible.

384
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,169
Smart.

385
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,589
All right. Serving.

386
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,174
Serving, serving, serving.

387
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,384
In the box.
In the box.

388
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,769
Why haven't
we heard anything?

389
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,647
It's 4:45. There's
only 15 minutes left.

390
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,982
Oh, now you
can do math?

391
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,984
Where were you two
hours ago, beautiful mind?

392
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,736
I made a mistake,
I'm sorry!

393
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,905
I know how to save
the company, everyone.

394
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,408
Just write a petition,
get everyone's signature,

395
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:00,746
including our clients,
march down to Florida

396
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,081
and shove it up your butt.

397
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,960
It's not that funny.

398
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,014
Pam, you got
something on your shirt.

399
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,600
Oh!

400
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:25,020
Well, pobody's
nerfect, right?

401
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,148
Did you just have a stroke,
Pam? It's "nobody's perfect.”

402
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,942
Nice stroke, Pam.

403
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,236
No, it's a jokey saying.

404
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,779
"Pobody's nerfect."

405
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,031
Like, I can't even
say those words right.

406
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,826
I hadn't heard that before.

407
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,953
That's funny.

408
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,539
Dwight, there's
just the small...

409
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,042
You know what would go so
great with this cabbage pie?

410
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,294
Milk.

411
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,628
Any specific animal?

412
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,464
I'm thinking cow.
Don't say cow.

413
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,135
What are you doing?
It's five to 5:00.

414
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,804
Just don't talk
about the e-mail, okay?

415
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,348
He's gonna cancel it on
his own. I really think he will.

416
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,350
That's insane!
Just trust me.

417
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,269
Trust you? Like I trusted
Dwight this morning?

418
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,687
I got this.

419
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,360
Thanks for everything.

420
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,820
Sive drafely.

421
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,660
Wasn't it supposed
to be drive safely?

422
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:26,957
Is that my phone?

423
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,835
Sounded like mine.

424
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,921
No, I think it's mine. Let me
just check real quick here.

425
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,256
All right.

426
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,092
No, it's mine.
You took it out of my bag.

427
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,053
Oh. Oops.

428
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,971
Yeah.
Can I have it?

429
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,139
Yes.

430
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,850
Right now?

431
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:45,934
Yes.
There you go.

432
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,895
Whoa! No! Wait, wait!

433
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,605
What the?

434
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,689
Oh, man.
I'm sorry!

435
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,566
Jesus!
Did it break?

436
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,860
No, it's good, thanks.
You sure?

437
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,111
Yeah.

438
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,446
What kind of
iPhone is that?

439
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,657
It's the standard one,
the one everyone has.

440
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,118
Yeah. I have the
one that nobody has.

441
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,371
Is there anything
interesting?

442
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,790
It depends, Jim.
Do you find one-day-only

443
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,292
JetBlue sales to
Buffalo interesting?

444
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,253
No, I don't.

445
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,797
No, I don't.

446
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,968
All right!

447
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,556
Well, I am sore and
obviously horrible at this.

448
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,933
My serve!

449
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,023
Dwight stopped the device!

450
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:34,858
Yes!

451
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,071
He stopped it!

452
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,906
Yes!

453
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,324
We still have our jobs.

454
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,410
They're not my favorite
people in the world.

455
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,161
I wouldn't even
call them friends.

456
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,664
<i>They come over here,
eat my pie,</i>

457
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,708
dig the crappiest horse grave
you've ever seen.

458
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,546
God, I'm gonna have to work
with them forever, aren't 1?

459
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,050
Just take it easy.
Nice and easy.

460
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,679
Classic, right?

461
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,357
Ooh!

462
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,900
I'm all right.
You all right?

463
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,444
Yeah.
Skinned knee.

464
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,611
Yeah.

465
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,782
Need a little ice
on that, maybe.

466
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,535
Yeah. That does
not feel good.

467
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,245
Okay. My serve.
