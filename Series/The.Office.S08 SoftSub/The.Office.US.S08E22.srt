1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:03,253
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:07,132
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,842
No!

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,552
Okay, fine.

5
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:13,013
Ryan, is something the matter?
Yeah.

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,849
Smokey's dead.

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,393
Smokey the Bear?

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,061
Smokey Robinson, Pam.

9
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,646
He died like
an hour ago.

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,898
I guess I'm the
first to know.

11
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,692
Wow, that's terrible.
I really liked him.

12
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,777
Oh, you liked him?
That's nice.

13
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,198
Did you like when he changed the course of
American music, like, two or three times?

14
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,283
Did you like that
Tracks of My Tears

15
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,869
is maybe the last true
love song ever written?

16
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,370
I'm glad you
like him, Jim.

17
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,456
I am completely
devastated right now.

18
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,417
Well, I second
that emotion. Huh?

19
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,836
I know a few of his songs,
but what were his big ones?

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,255
Oh, God, Nellie.
What wasn't his?

21
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,216
I mean,
Tracks of My Tears.

22
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,717
Yeah.

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,052
God, so many, Nellie.

24
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,553
No, no, no.

25
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,472
Tracks of My Tears
and what else?

26
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,891
What are some more?
What's one more?

27
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,312
Okay, I'm not I'm not playing
this game, Pam. Not today.

28
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,356
I don't think you love
Smokey Robinson.

29
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,567
I think you're just doing all of this to
prove how deep you are about music.

30
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,363
Okay, I'm sorry that I'm not a
fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.

31
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,614
You don't like
the Beatles?

32
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,907
That's not the point.

33
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,784
Eleanor Rigby?
Paperback Writer?

34
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,245
You always think you have time to
see these legends before they go.

35
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,621
What was I so
busy doing?

36
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,874
It says here the Smokey
Robinson dead thing is a hoax.

37
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,668
It's on CNN as of
two minutes ago.

38
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,505
Okay, well.
That's a relief.

39
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,048
Wow, look at that.

40
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,217
Says he's actually
playing State College.

41
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,510
That's only three
hours away.

42
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,846
Oh, my God, Ryan,
that's perfect.

43
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,056
You have to go.

44
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,683
Tickets are
250 bucks.

45
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:44,187
$250 is nothing to the world's
biggest Smokey Robinson fan.

46
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,481
Yeah.

47
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,567
Who's opening?
Paul Anka.

48
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,986
Paul Anka?

49
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,614
How can they make the Smoke
Man play with someone like that?

50
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,449
I don't think
I can see this.

51
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,951
Okay, you could just
show up late, though.

52
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,452
How much is parking,
like, 30 bucks?

53
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,454
That's not what Smokey
would have wanted.

54
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,956
Does want.

55
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,458
Tears of a Clown. Don't
call me a clown, Pam.

56
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,876
You're better than that.

57
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,322
Looking good, RC.

58
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,823
I hate ties.

59
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,742
I feel like I'm
being strangled,

60
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:43,330
like I'm at some erotic
asphyxiation sex club over on 1-84.

61
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,248
The Red Room, say,
or Dominick's.

62
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,168
Robert, the Senator was
going to wear dark brown tonight.

63
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,588
I'm sure it'll be fine.

64
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,842
My husband is sponsoring a
fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters.

65
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,054
Robert California bought
two tables for everyone here.

66
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,722
These people were
lucky to get seats

67
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:04,642
because it is going to be a who's
who of the northern 22nd district.

68
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,063
I don't want to alarm people,

69
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,982
but there is a distinct chance
that we're all about to be killed.

70
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,567
Well, as long as you
don't want to alarm people.

71
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,320
What's going on? There's
a disgruntled ex-employee

72
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,155
sitting in his car
in the parking lot.

73
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,782
Oh, that's Andy.
He's just hanging out.

74
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,034
That's how workplace
tragedies always begin.

75
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,870
A middle-aged white
male "hanging out."

76
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:24,996
Call the cops.

77
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,790
Dwight, I don't think he's
going to hurt anybody.

78
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,833
How do you know? I mean,
why do you think he's there?

79
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,543
I don't even know
what kind of weapon he has.

80
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,295
Could be a knife,
could be a gun.

81
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,964
Could be a series of guns,
all lined up to shoot parallel.

82
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,508
I'm going up
to the roof.

83
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,135
I'm going to bring my
gym bag just in case.

84
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,262
I knew this would happen.

85
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:45,308
Everybody told me if I moved
to America, I'd be murdered.

86
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,566
Hey.
Hey.

87
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,820
Just wanted to say hi and hear
you say everything's normal.

88
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,697
Maybe videotape you saying that
so that everyone upstairs can see?

89
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,492
We think you
might kill Robert.

90
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,618
What?

91
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:07,747
Because he fired you, which means
apparently you're living in your car now.

92
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,416
Guys, everything
is fine.

93
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,876
I'm just here to pick up Erin.
We're going to the fundraiser.

94
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,128
Great. That
sounds good.

95
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,254
Wait, what?

96
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,256
You're going to the
fundraiser tonight?

97
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,424
That's going to be weird.

98
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,967
Why would
that be weird?

99
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,343
It's going to be
super weird.

100
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,262
He just fired
you last week.

101
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,305
Andy's just coming
as my date.

102
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,766
Hey, I hear you.
I hope you're right.

103
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,854
It just seems like it's going
to be really, really weird.

104
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,481
Come in.

105
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,068
You really redid
Andy's office, huh?

106
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,778
Yes, cut out
the clutter.

107
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,905
Very simple,
very minimal.

108
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,867
I need you to sign these.
We got a shipment going out.

109
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,327
How are things in
the warehouse?

110
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,079
You could go downstairs
and ask them.

111
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,874
The warehouse
isn't downstairs.

112
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,793
Is it?

113
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,378
Is it?

114
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,380
Who knew, right?

115
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,549
I...

116
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,470
Tonight could be the
night that Darryl and I

117
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:07,724
go from casual work
friends to actual good friends.

118
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:13,396
The only thing standing in our way is
the contempt he seems to feel for me.

119
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,234
Robert, the Senator and
I wanted to stop by.

120
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,777
Hello. Robert.
Robert, how are you?

121
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,279
- And say hello.
- Hello.

122
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,282
Did anyone order a blast from
the past with a side order of sexy?

123
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,702
Hi, Andy.
Oh, man, this is weird.

124
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,995
Andrew.

125
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,706
Want to shake
my hand, huh?

126
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,043
Because I want to
shake your body.

127
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,088
I had you, I had you.

128
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,715
Where...
Where do I look?

129
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,635
It's been so long since I
did one of these things.

130
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,094
Okay, all right.

131
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,722
What's the question?
How am I doing? Umm...

132
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,766
Great.

133
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,187
So, how's the talent?

134
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,940
Grey suit over there
is sending a signal.

135
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,108
Downstairs is receiving.

136
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,820
Is that Gabe?

137
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,489
Ladies.

138
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,867
How come you look so
decent all of a sudden?

139
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,410
Yeah, normally you
look so stricken.

140
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,704
Well, I'm embarrassed.

141
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,665
I had to give up
my hair gel

142
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,000
because it was giving me
this angry rash on my scalp.

143
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,586
And I just gave up
on this low-protein diet

144
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,964
that I was doing
for eight years, so...

145
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,218
Ladies seem to like it, plus I'm getting,
like, half as many bladder infections.

146
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,970
Wow.
Yeah.

147
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,264
Wow. You ladies
look very pretty as well.

148
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,058
Thanks.
Why is it that things are

149
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,310
their most beautiful
in the autumn of their lives?

150
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,356
You had to say that.

151
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,525
Sorry. Sorry.
Thanks.

152
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,651
Yeah.

153
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,905
Creed, I just bid $20
on six jujitsu lessons.

154
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,074
No one's
raping this guy.

155
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,742
Well, I don't
want to get raped.

156
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,827
22.

157
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,996
No, it was my idea to
not be raped. Oh, well.

158
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,082
Wait, you think that
jujitsu classes cost $22?

159
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,417
If you're going to
play guess the price,

160
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,252
you might as well try
and be halfway accurate.

161
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,795
$180.

162
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,130
Whoa.

163
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,548
Dwight, I don't think
you understand.

164
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,758
You guess the price,
you win the prize.

165
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,761
Have you never been
to a Quaker fair before?

166
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,180
God.

167
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,393
So, Dwight doesn't
understand silent auctions.

168
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,148
I guess he's the stupid
guy in the office. Huh?

169
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:24,110
Because up until now
we didn't have one.

170
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,695
What haven't I been doing?

171
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,573
Gosh, just today I was working
on this rock opera that I'm writing,

172
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,200
although it feels more like
I'm receiving it than writing it.

173
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,620
Wow, that's
exciting.

174
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,748
But until you firm up the idea, you
might want to keep it between us.

175
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,417
The hero lives in
this dystopian future

176
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,588
and he flies around in a spaceship
that's shaped like a treble clef.

177
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,424
And he has to sing his
heart out to destroy all evil.

178
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,217
Sounds like you're
doing all right.

179
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,595
A little better than
all right, actually.

180
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,805
Really good.

181
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,515
Have you thought about
getting into photography?

182
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,851
Are you kidding me?
"Cause I'm way into it.

183
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,645
What are you
taking pictures of?

184
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,771
Children?
Yes.

185
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,980
Homeless people?
Yes.

186
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,649
"Cause in a way,
they're more real...

187
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,484
...than the rest of us!
The rest of us!

188
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,028
This guy's
having a breakdown.

189
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,573
You know, Oscar, I really had no idea
that you were so passionate about animals.

190
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,367
My dog, Gerald,
is my life, Really?

191
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,202
Well, if you want to
get involved, call me.

192
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,204
This is my cell.

193
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,291
I'm more likely to
pick up at night, say,

194
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,252
after 9:00.

195
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,214
Excuse me.

196
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,007
This confirms three things.

197
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:32,136
I'm right about the Senator,
I still got it, and poor Angela.

198
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,889
I wonder where they
got the flowers.

199
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,974
That piece is
so predictable.

200
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,519
Daffodils in spring,
I wonder what's next,

201
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,603
mistletoe at Christmas?

202
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,605
Yeah.

203
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,982
Oh! It says, "You're
welcome to take this home."

204
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,734
Oh.

205
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,571
Sweetie, you don't want that.
Even in your house, it's a little much.

206
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,116
Have you ever been
to our house?

207
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,284
Not exactly,
but I know the Flats.

208
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,330
I'm going to say what
everyone is afraid to say.

209
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,499
Phyllis is a bully.

210
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,627
A big, beautiful bully.

211
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,338
And she is not
getting that centerpiece.

212
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,508
Step in right
away and start...

213
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,176
Bobby, Bobbo.

214
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,886
You're a rock
opera guy, right?

215
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,513
You like rock operas.
Well...

216
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,056
You've got to check out
this thing I'm working on.

217
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,141
It's really cool.

218
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,851
There's this character,
Thomas Oregon,

219
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,895
and he wants to destroy
all the guitars in the world

220
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:28,151
because he realizes that music
is the one thing he can't control.

221
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,946
So, Thomas Oregon
is an evil figure.

222
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,239
Evil.

223
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,117
Although he's
humanized at the end

224
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,537
because he weeps uncontrollably
and pees in his pants.

225
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,123
And the hero,
who is that based on?

226
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,041
Me, I guess.

227
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,254
We're flying so
high we're cracking the sky

228
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:52,592
Going to fly out of this
dome My girlfriend and I

229
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,680
Hey, jabroni,
show some class.

230
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,932
She's right, Andy.
You're being a jabroni.

231
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,434
You're being a
Thomas Oregon.

232
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,603
Andrew,

233
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,774
I think this may have
been a bad idea.

234
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,943
Why don't you let me
pay for you and Erin

235
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,946
to go out to a great,
romantic dinner tonight?

236
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,699
Don't need you to pay for me.
I'm doing just fine, thank you.

237
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,577
Why don't you quit
harshing our mellow?

238
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,246
Andy, you should leave.

239
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,372
Now.

240
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,626
Excuse me,

241
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,213
I would like to purchase two
seats at another table, please.

242
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,298
I'm sorry. The tables are
sold as complete units.

243
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,634
Then I'll take a table.

244
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,718
Okay.

245
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,386
And a high five.

246
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,348
Let's do that again.

247
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,394
Well, I just give a
dollar to every charity.

248
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,271
That way, you get all
the mail, all the calendars.

249
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,732
You can't believe how
much you get just for a buck.

250
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,693
It's also nice to know
you're making a difference.

251
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,779
Jim and I give
to the Red Cross.

252
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,864
Are you sure you
ought to be giving?

253
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,158
I mean, with your
financial situation...

254
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,743
Excuse me?

255
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,332
You ladies are as tangy as the
salad dressing over there. I love it.

256
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,876
Oh, yes indeed.

257
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,170
When.

258
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,715
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

259
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,592
Forgot a few salads.

260
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,515
When.

261
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,855
When.

262
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,776
I stumbled into a
very dramatic situation.

263
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,445
Here, let me move this
SO you can see him.

264
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,531
Pam.

265
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,409
Pam.
Yeah.

266
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,619
Angela's husband
just hit on me.

267
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,455
Oh, my God.
I know.

268
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,665
Wait, what? Come on.

269
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,042
We were talking
about animals.

270
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,837
He gives me his
cell phone number.

271
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,213
He was just dying
for me to have it.

272
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,633
Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying
you're not dreamy, because you are,

273
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,511
but isn't it possible that he
was just schmoozing a voter?

274
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,431
Well, if you would have
seen the look he gave me.

275
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,141
He wanted to rock
more than just my vote.

276
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,309
Okay.

277
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,602
What was this look?

278
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,439
Whoa!

279
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,232
What happened?
Did he do it? Are you...

280
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,151
Twice. For real?

281
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,570
Okay, guys. Not every glance
means something, all right?

282
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,654
Life isn't Downton Abbey.

283
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,031
Life is Downton Abbey.

284
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,115
Here's what
I'm going to do.

285
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,617
I'm going to go over there,
I'm going to talk to him.

286
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,702
And I guarantee you he gives
out his cell phone to everybody.

287
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,132
How much do you guys charge
for one full-year gym membership?

288
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,093
Thank you.

289
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,598
It's $475.

290
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,268
Like candy from a baby.

291
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,109
That's the third time you've
asked me about my strategy.

292
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,904
It's called "Guess the Price,"
strategy's in the name.

293
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,782
Simplest game since
"Touch the Rock."

294
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,242
Three-time champion.

295
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,787
Almost four, but
I touched the wood.

296
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,916
Hey.

297
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,628
David Wallace?
Andy Bernard?

298
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,588
Hey, how are you?
How you doing? I'm great.

299
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,298
How are you doing? Are
you still with Dunder Mifflin?

300
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,967
No, got canned last week.

301
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:22,760
Oh. I'm sorry
to hear that.

302
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,303
No, best thing that
ever happened to me.

303
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,513
That's the attitude
to have.

304
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,140
You know what? When I
got canned, I was lost, right?

305
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:32,061
I poured myself into this ridiculous
vacuum for toys called Suck It.

306
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,355
Yikes.
Yeah, exactly, right?

307
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,481
Then suddenly
out of nowhere,

308
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:39,068
the US Military bought the
patent from me for $20 million.

309
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,821
Point is,
forget those guys.

310
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:42,947
Okay? Move on.

311
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,491
Good to see you, Andy.

312
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:54,417
Call me a lay man, but I wish
there was some real food here.

313
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,836
You know,
like hamburgers

314
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,841
or Oreos,
or a pizza pie, or...

315
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,594
What's another food
that we like? Tacos.

316
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:10,641
What I wouldn't give
for a big mess of tacos.

317
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:11,976
Tacos.
Right now.

318
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,686
I can go get us
some tacos.

319
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,854
Brilliant.

320
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,397
If you loan me
some money.

321
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,232
Yes, I can do that.

322
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,779
For two tacos we
probably need about,

323
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:28,325
what, $207?
Or $25720...

324
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,702
$30.

325
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,495
Yes, yes.

326
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,581
I've never eaten a taco.

327
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,708
I'm not entirely sure
what they are.

328
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:40,129
As long as they're not slimy, and
please, God, don't let them have eyes.

329
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,926
So”?
Boom.

330
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,805
This is interesting.

331
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,183
Mm-hmm.
What is interesting?

332
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,226
I just proved that he gives
his cell out to everybody.

333
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,438
Or you proved that
he thinks you're gay.

334
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,898
He doesn't think
Jim is gay.

335
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,649
A gay man would not leave
the house wearing those shoes.

336
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,027
A gay man wouldn't leave
the store wearing those shoes.

337
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,321
Hey, you bought me
these shoes.

338
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,698
Wait a second,
where's the centerpiece?

339
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,992
I knew it was bothering you,
so I threw it in the garbage.

340
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,912
Really, Phyllis? You
didn't just put it in your car?

341
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,996
Nope.

342
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,123
Which garbage?
It's not there anymore.

343
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,584
A man emptied the garbage
into a bigger garbage

344
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,920
and then I heard someone say
they were locking the garbage.

345
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,797
You are out
of control, Phyllis.

346
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,342
Come on, sweetie. We both
knew how this was gonna end.

347
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,515
Before we bring out
our guest of honor tonight,

348
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:37,770
we are very proud to introduce a
great philanthropist, and a great guy,

349
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,772
Robert California.

350
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,821
Thank you.

351
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,989
Why do we love dogs?

352
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,617
Want me to tell you why?

353
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,327
There is no answer.

354
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,914
Our love for them
confounds reason.

355
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,916
Do you believe this guy?

356
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,877
The State Senator Robert
Lipton loves dogs.

357
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,713
He asked me if I loved dogs.

358
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,299
You know what I said?

359
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,425
Yes.

360
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,429
Not a joke. That,
that was not even a joke.

361
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,933
Bella here was a
therapy dog for 10 years.

362
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:20,646
When her owner passed away, she
came to this organization for placement.

363
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:24,233
But people don't often
adopt older dogs.

364
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:29,155
So Bella and 11
heroes like her

365
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:33,659
are being cared for by
our generous volunteers

366
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,786
because, frankly,
nobody else will.

367
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,289
I will.

368
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:42,084
I will take all
of those dogs.

369
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,919
Andy, that's very
kind, but...

370
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:48,007
No, no, no. This guy can
talk and talk all he wants,

371
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,800
but it's not that
complicated.

372
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,428
Andy, why don't we discuss
this... No, no, no. It's about

373
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,974
being there for someone after it's
become inconvenient for them to be around.

374
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,101
Hello, everyone.
I'm Andy Bernard

375
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:03,105
and I am going to take
that bitch home.

376
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,568
That is a female
dog reference.

377
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,487
This bitch
understands loyalty.

378
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,031
Sassy human reference.

379
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,617
Thank you.
I will take Bella.

380
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,035
Aw!

381
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,412
And every single
one of her friends.

382
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,747
Oh, God.

383
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,876
This way.

384
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,003
Hope you all learned
something. Okay.

385
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,217
Huey's going to need his
medication once every 90 minutes.

386
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,177
You can administer it orally,
but he's going to puke it up.

387
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,678
So other end's best.

388
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:38,182
Don't split up Daisy and Mojo,
because Daisy will start to...

389
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,893
I was going to say bark,
but it's more of a scream.

390
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,854
I'm so ready to love
all of these animals.

391
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,523
This one's even bonding
with me already.

392
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,359
I know. Kenny's
a therapy dog.

393
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,819
He apparently thinks you're in
some kind of emotional crisis.

394
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,615
Stupid dog.

395
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,494
If you would like to talk about this
some more, my door is always open.

396
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,163
So here's my office number
and my cell number.

397
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,873
Thank you.
Okay.

398
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,209
Well, it looks like he
really did just want

399
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,002
to talk about the issues.
I'm sorry, Oscar.

400
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,256
No, sorry about what? There's
nothing to be sorry about here.

401
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:15,135
No, I'm certainly not disappointed that
Angela's husband wasn't hitting on me.

402
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,846
I'd have to be a
monster to root for that.

403
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,015
A lonely, aging monster.

404
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,185
Tacos were on sale.

405
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,853
Eight for $3.

406
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,690
Oh, great.

407
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,109
Okay.

408
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,653
Oh. Oh. Oh...

409
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,238
These tacos.

410
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,864
Mm-hmm. Mmm...

411
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,367
Uh...

412
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:45,708
Uh...

413
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,959
Mmm.

414
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,420
Mmm. Oh!

415
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,380
Huh.

416
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,382
Mmm.

417
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,635
Well, that's hit the spot.

418
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,886
Um...

419
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,430
Very savory.

420
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,474
What do you do with
the crispy holder?

421
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,518
Here, let's try this again.

422
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,145
Here, don't put
your finger in...

423
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,855
Yeah, just hold it like
that. Hold it to the side.

424
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,857
Right.
Hold it to the side.

425
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,067
Lean it to the side.
Look at me, like this.

426
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,403
She's trying.

427
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,741
The winner of the three-day
trip to the Skytop Lodge

428
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,826
is Dwight Schrute!

429
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,952
Yes!

430
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:30,210
The year-long membership to
Scranton Bikram Yoga is...

431
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:31,837
Dwight Schrute!

432
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,255
Oh, yes!

433
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,215
Yeah!

434
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:42,639
A one hour appointment with the
"Kissing Magician” goes to Dwight Schrute.

435
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,726
Oh, yeah!

436
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:50,105
Well I think I can save
us all some time.

437
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,942
Dwight Schrute has
won every single item here.

438
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,486
Thank you very much!

439
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:59,281
All I had to do was look up
the prices, idiots. Suck it!

440
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:03,327
Well, Dwight, yes, you
certainly are a record breaker.

441
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,122
Your donation is the largest
we've ever received

442
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,834
at over $34,000.

443
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,675
Speech!

444
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,677
Speech!

445
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,805
Come on. Speech, speech!

446
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,486
Thank you.

447
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,156
Wow, I can't tell you

448
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,869
what an honor it is
to support this

449
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,664
thing.

450
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:53,293
And obviously that amount of
money is no concern to me whatsoever.

451
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,549
But I want to ask
you something.

452
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,845
When did it become
all about the money?

453
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,683
When did it become about
the flower arrangements?

454
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,144
And the white
wine spritzers?

455
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,270
Hmm?

456
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,480
And all the dinner rolls?

457
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,441
You people should be
ashamed of yourselves.

458
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,026
How many courses did
we have tonight?

459
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,362
Two? Three, maybe?

460
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,573
If you chose the pudding.

461
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:27,870
I mean, what waste. These tables
tarted up like Victorian whores.

462
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,205
Let's remember we are all here

463
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,293
for the dog society.

464
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,379
He's what's important,
whatever his name is.

465
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,465
Not any of this.

466
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,635
So that is going to be
my donation to you.

467
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,387
Thank you and good night.

468
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,472
Whoa!

469
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,390
Uh...

470
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,439
Oscar. Nice to
see you again.

471
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,316
It was lovely.
It was lovely.

472
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,735
And don't forget to call. Okay.

473
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,907
Thanks so
much for coming.

474
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,409
Why does this always
happen to me? Ahh!

475
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,871
I just feel so
bad for Angela.

476
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,083
Apparently, there were some
silly rumors going around tonight.

477
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,586
We are very much in love.

478
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,923
Very much in love.

479
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:25,093
So it just goes on under
here like this?

480
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,595
That's right.

481
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,847
Oh, God. Yeah, you
never get used to that.

482
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,475
Hey, just wanted to check in
to see how you're doing.

483
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,935
I am so great.

484
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,479
He's great.
We're all great.

485
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,855
Twelve dogs.

486
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,691
This is my life now.
I'm a dog nurse.

487
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,693
Look at that one,
though. He's smiling.

488
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,238
Yeah, he should be. It's
his first day without a muzzle.

489
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,408
This is the greatest thing
that has ever happened to me.

490
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,327
Absolutely, it's...
Yes.

491
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,495
Awesome.
I'm sorry.

492
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,955
Are you guys nuts?

493
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,498
He's not doing great.

494
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,958
He was fired.

495
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,251
This is terrible.

496
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,046
This is literally the worst thing
that has ever happened to you.

497
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,297
Not the best.

498
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,972
You're right.

499
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,807
He's right. I am a mess.

500
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,351
This whole night I've been trying
to convince you guys that I'm fine.

501
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:18,814
I guess I thought that if I could
convince you that I'm fine, maybe...

502
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,524
Maybe you would
think it, too.

503
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,447
I'm sorry,
it's just, I...

504
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,368
I don't get to be in a lot of
human conversations, so...

505
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,746
Okay. Well, Andy, listen, it's
okay if you don't feel totally settled.

506
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,164
This is all very fresh.

507
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,500
Yeah, I mean, admitting that
you need help is the first step.

508
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:42,004
Yes, and also focusing
on the positive.

509
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,506
Like, I got a lot of good
things going on.

510
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,092
Yeah, like that
rock opera.

511
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,552
You could always
do that, right?

512
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,304
Yeah, I do. I have that.

513
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,472
Yeah.

514
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,682
You're going
to be all right.

515
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,642
No. No, he's not.

516
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,436
Yes, I am.

517
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,646
Thank you, Kev.
You're welcome.

518
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:04,026
Sometimes I feel like
everyone I work with is an idiot.

519
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,321
And by sometimes,
I mean all times.

520
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,656
All the times.

521
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,534
Every of the time.

522
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,748
So, some of us ended up
adopting those elderly dogs.

523
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,832
It's been great.

524
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,793
Pepper's been getting me
out of the house. Going on runs.

525
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,379
My dog Ruby
doesn't do anything.

526
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,298
She just lays
there all day.

527
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,883
She's so chill.

528
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,468
What do you
feed her?

529
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,638
Well, I put out Pro Bow Wow,
but she barely touches it.

530
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,097
She's so dainty.

531
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,474
Is she sick?

532
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,017
How are her poops?

533
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,268
Doesn't really poop.

534
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:39,895
It's perfect.

535
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,313
Nothing to pick up.

536
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,066
She just kind of lies there
all day like a good girl.

537
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,151
I put on the TV for her,

538
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,529
but I have to prop her eyes
open SO she can see it.

539
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,781
Does she smell?

540
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,407
She smells horrible.

541
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,742
It's unbelievable.

542
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,994
But I don't want to
put her in the bath.

543
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,288
"Cause I'm afraid
that she'll drown.

544
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:03,210
People seem awful
interested in you, Ruby.

545
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,338
Guess they're
just jealous, right?

546
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,256
Yeah, that a girl.

547
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,758
That a girl.

548
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,093
Man, that stinks.
