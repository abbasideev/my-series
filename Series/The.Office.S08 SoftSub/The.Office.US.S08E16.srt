1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:02,502
Hey, Angela,

2
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:03,795
you wanna see
a picture of Philip

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,213
wearing those little
booties you got us?

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,215
So cute.

5
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,594
Hey, you guys wanna see a
picture of Gerald wearing galoshes?

6
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,513
He refused to go out in
the rain until I bought these.

7
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,932
Now, going out in the rain
is all he wants to do.

8
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:20,395
Oscar thinks having a dog
is just like having a baby.

9
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:21,855
News flash,
if you didn't carry

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,398
it around in your
belly for nine months,

11
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,524
it isn't your kid.

12
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:25,984
Exactly.

13
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,861
Unless you adopted,
of course.

14
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,446
That is where we disagree.

15
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,115
Hey, are your little
dudes crawling yet?

16
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:35,035
No. Three-month-old
humans don't do that.

17
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,621
My Philip is crawling.

18
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,499
Angela is such a liar!

19
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,834
It's maddening!

20
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,046
Exactly, that's just
like crate training.

21
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,131
All night long.
All night long.

22
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:49,799
Well, count yourself lucky.

23
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,176
Wait until you have two.

24
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,095
That's two sleep schedules,
two naps that don't coincide.

25
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,223
I mean,
you'll never sleep again.

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,225
No one said
you must have two.

27
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,893
Like her genes
are so important.

28
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,646
The world just needs more
Pam-Jim DNA. Thank you, no.

29
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,064
No, thank you.

30
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,736
Check this out. My brother
just got a new sailboat.

31
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:13,240
He has no idea what he
just got himself into.

32
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,617
There's nothing harder
than taking care of a boat.

33
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,327
Am I right?

34
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:18,828
Unbelievable!
Unbelievable!

35
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,956
Unbelievable!

36
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,387
It is the end of the day.
It is the end of the week.

37
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,099
We managed to fill
40 hours, somehow.

38
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,308
That's not bad, is it?

39
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,477
That's great.
Pretty good.

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,522
Well, thank you,
this is very helpful feedback.

41
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,857
Dwight, I am still not
ready to name the V.P.

42
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,609
That's not what
I was gonna ask.

43
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,820
Gosh, you jump to conclusions!

44
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,447
Come on, I know. You've
got so much on your plate,

45
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,907
it's right now you're like,

46
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:59,119
"Oh, what's more important, Dwight's
question, figure out who's the V.P.

47
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,371
"Dwight. V.P. Dwight. V.P."

48
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,832
Dwight. V.P. Dwight. V.P.

49
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,709
I can't be hypnotized, Dwight.

50
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,627
I tried it.
I ended up smoking more.

51
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,463
Can we at least eliminate
those that are not in the running?

52
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,341
Free them up to focus
more completely on the menial.

53
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,593
Like stacking
and sorting, or...

54
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,178
Catching butterflies?

55
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,888
That's a hobby.
Unless it's for food.

56
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,724
Theater.
A waste of time.

57
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,058
Dragging?

58
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,268
That's just a verb.

59
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,352
Dragging sticks.

60
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,520
Yes. Nice. Perfect.

61
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,980
Dragging sticks...

62
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,274
All right, I'm gonna eliminate
three people right now.

63
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,609
Okay? Just. You three. No.

64
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,362
Not good enough.

65
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,909
English people's main use
today is judging American talent.

66
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,954
"You're crap.
You're wonderful."

67
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,498
They're mean,
but they're incisive.

68
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,543
<i>Everyone meet in
the hotel bar at 7-00.</i>

69
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,587
I'm not allowed to
say it's mandatory.

70
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,672
So let's just
call it compulsory.

71
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,050
I'll be there at 6:00.

72
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,344
Ugh. We're gonna have one
of those crazy nights, aren't we?

73
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,762
Maybe we'll see
the real Talla-nasty

74
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,180
we've been
hearing so much about.

75
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,765
Talla-nasty. Very clever.

76
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,308
Thank you.
Wait, wait.

77
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,560
You think she
invented "Talla-nasty"?

78
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,896
No, no, no, no.

79
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,942
Cathy? It's been
great, fun, normal.

80
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,612
I thought I was gonna be
hanging out with Stanley on this trip,

81
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,947
but he's turned out
to be kind of a loose cannon.

82
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,783
My friend and I
are new here in Tallahassee.

83
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,743
Would you like
to get a cocktail?

84
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:25,622
Maybe go out for a little
dancing? Beautiful day, no?

85
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,000
<i>Okay, everybody.
5.00. Work day's over.</i>

86
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:32,921
Put your pencils down,
and bring 'em back up!

87
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,007
Because now, the late
night work jam begins!

88
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,926
Yes! The conference
room is set up.

89
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,470
I've got pens, I've got paper,
I've got a whiteboard!

90
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,846
We are good to go.

91
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,014
Say what?

92
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,432
We are good to go!

93
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,476
Say what?
Good to go!

94
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,977
Stop it!
Andy!

95
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,105
Tonight, we're staying late
to service the accounts

96
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,398
of the people who
went on the Florida trip.

97
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,857
Yes, of course
we could have just

98
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,359
been doing this
the whole time,

99
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,611
but someone dropped the ball.

100
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,948
Ball droppings
can be beautiful.

101
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:04,202
For example, when it turns an
awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.

102
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,498
Jason Bourne
would kick Bond's ass.

103
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,584
Jason Bourne has
no support staff,

104
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,253
his own government's
out to get him.

105
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,754
Genghis Khan could
take 'em both down,

106
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,339
'cause he's not
afraid to kill children.

107
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,176
What? It's true.

108
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,720
He would eviscerate
babies and hang them

109
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,431
from poles
outside of the villages.

110
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,059
Okay, drinking game. The
count of three, take three sips.

111
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,438
That's a stupid game. I got
a great drinking game. Okay?

112
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,939
Everyone, empty your pockets.

113
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,191
Whoever has
the most seeds is the king,

114
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,153
whoever has the least buttons
is the hunchback.

115
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,779
What happens if
you're the hunchback?

116
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,072
Oh, you get kicked.

117
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,323
How many buttons do you have?

118
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,992
Forty. Always.

119
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,702
Can I see?
Sure.

120
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,704
So I get to kick you now.

121
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,873
No, they're not transferable
just 'cause I handed them to you.

122
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,040
Well, that's how I
played it in college.

123
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,208
College rules.

124
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,838
And he lost at
his own lame game.

125
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,048
Ooh! Double meaning.

126
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,135
The game was lame, and
now he's lame from the kick.

127
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,053
Quick wit.
Thank you.

128
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,057
I will have a glass of your
oakiest chardonnay, please.

129
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,811
And I will have a waffle.
With your maple-iest syrup.

130
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,980
Sorry, no waffles.

131
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,734
Okay, just forget it then.
Forget it. Forget it?

132
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,569
Waffle?

133
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,905
A hotel waffle.
I know what I wanna eat.

134
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,531
Is that crazy?
No.

135
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,575
I'm moving down here,
you know.

136
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,828
Oh. No, I didn't know.

137
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,331
I'm young and I can.

138
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,583
And if I can't,
I'm still pretty young.

139
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,335
I guess I'll always be young.

140
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,338
You come with me. We're
gonna get you that waffle.

141
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,175
Why would Erin confide in me
that she's staying here in Florida

142
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,178
if she didn't want me to make some
sort of last ditch, nothing-to-lose,

143
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,930
Kelly Ka-who run at her?

144
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,556
Hey.

145
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,558
Watson Carpet ♪ Tile.

146
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,935
One order.

147
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:56,022
Order reference
number 00983-126.

148
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,358
Eight cases
Bright White Inkjet.

149
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,400
Paid.

150
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,152
I'm dying!

151
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,114
Processed.
And delivered.

152
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,742
Sometimes I get so bored,
I just wanna scream.

153
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,953
And then sometimes,
I actually do scream.

154
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,372
I just sort of feel out
what the situation calls for.

155
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,791
I will be right back.

156
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,292
I will be here.

157
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,214
Hey, I see what you're doing.
It's futile. The V.P. position is mine.

158
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,049
Oh, please, you're through.

159
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:27,053
She's going to give it to me,
as I'm giving it to her tonight.

160
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,473
The cowgirl has chosen her
saddle.

161
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,186
Well, saddles...

162
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,064
...sometimes fall off.

163
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,858
Especially if you don't
properly cinch the girth.

164
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:44,612
What? That's a joke, right? You
see the way she's all over me.

165
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:50,660
If anyone's having sex with
Nellie for personal gain, it's me.

166
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,620
And I'm not joking at all.

167
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,248
If you don't tighten your
saddle, you may fall off.

168
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,959
Who is ready for dinner?

169
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:03,006
"Oh, I bet it's pizza or tacos
or something stupid." No.

170
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,758
I went south of
the border for this,

171
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,260
and then I went
south of that border,

172
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:11,180
and we have ourselves
a Jamaican feast, man.

173
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,350
If I wanted Jamaican food,
I'd just hire

174
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,185
a bunch of
bodyguards and go there.

175
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:20,607
Additional trivia factoid, this
food comes to us through Val,

176
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,693
and our server is none
other than Brandon, her boyf.

177
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,361
Hey.

178
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,654
How you doing, guys?

179
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,159
Jamaican, huh? I just read
about the elections down there.

180
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,243
Crazy stuff.

181
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,578
Oh, no. I'm not
actually Jamaican.

182
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,954
Terrific.

183
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,789
What's up, man? I'm Darryl.

184
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,249
Oh, Darryl.
I heard about you.

185
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,709
You doing good?
Oh, yeah.

186
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,753
You must be doing real good
since you're my girlfriend.

187
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,630
Whoa!

188
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,216
Dude, you didn't tell me you
were Val. High five!

189
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,635
I'm not sleeping
with your girlfriend.

190
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,094
Brandon, what the hell
are you talking about?

191
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,512
Don't play dumb with me.
I know what's up.

192
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,597
Honey, I am not sleeping...

193
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,309
Hey! Hey.
Let's get back to the food.

194
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,811
Brandon, tell us about
these delicious-looking goops.

195
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,189
Hope you all like goat.

196
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,024
Goat.

197
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,152
Blow in my ear.
All right.

198
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,820
Like I'm on the beach.

199
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,910
A seagull.

200
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,788
And a wave crashing.

201
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,457
A wave crashing.

202
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,835
Oh, that is lovely.

203
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,714
All right, that's
gonna do it for me tonight.

204
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,675
Have a lovely evening.

205
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,230
Hey, how's it going?

206
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:46,025
Good. The heating system,
though, in my room is all messed up.

207
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,443
It's like 90 degrees
in there.

208
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,113
Maintenance is working on it.
Can I hang out in here?

209
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,573
Uh... Yeah, I'm just
watching basketball...

210
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,826
Okay. Yeah.
Okay.

211
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,285
Cool.

212
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,165
Is this March Madness?
I love March Madness.

213
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:05,128
Oh, no. That's not this.
Because that's in March.

214
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,715
This is just the NBA,
professional.

215
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,551
Miami Heat, actually. So...

216
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,386
LeBron James.
Yes.

217
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,764
Nice, good word association.

218
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,154
Impressive.

219
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,406
Oh, please,
anyone can tie a knot.

220
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,159
The real skill
is in untying it.

221
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,538
Thornwood Wholesalers.

222
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,581
One order.

223
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,915
I read the texts
you sent to Val, man.

224
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,625
That's messed up.

225
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,918
Is this spicy?

226
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,587
No, baby girl.
It would be messed up

227
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,338
if I didn't find anything.
But I did, so...

228
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,258
I'm pretty sure if
Darryl sent Val a text,

229
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,719
it was about some paper
emergency or something.

230
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,803
At midnight?

231
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,765
It happens.

232
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,100
Like, a hospital needs
more napkins for surgery.

233
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,727
You guys, we're not gonna
settle anything this way.

234
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,062
I think we just need to be
grown-ups here. Thank you.

235
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,522
I think we're gonna
need to hear those texts.

236
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,108
Kelly, remember how you wanted
to go home before?

237
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,611
No. There's no way
in hell I'm leaving.

238
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,279
Something interesting
is happening here.

239
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,031
For once in my life.
I am staying here.

240
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,282
Darryl, read the texts!

241
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,579
Yep? Coming!

242
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,875
All right. Hey. My
minibar is oddly out of rum.

243
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,043
We have plenty.

244
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,295
Oh. Hello.

245
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,131
You wanna watch the game
with us? We're watching a game.

246
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,758
The Heat game.
It's just a game.

247
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,593
Got it. Good night.

248
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,387
Careful, Jim,
it gets easier and easier.

249
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,682
No. No, no. Stanley?
Stanley. Stanley?

250
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,434
Stanley. All right. Hey!

251
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,603
You know. Just bring
back those bottles!

252
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,065
Huh. The lights
are still on.

253
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,566
Yeah. They keep
them on, 'cause it's

254
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,068
less expensive than
turning them on and off.

255
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,862
I like how guys just
know stuff all the time.

256
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,447
Girls know a lot
of stuff too, okay?

257
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,074
And nobody
knows more than you.

258
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,534
Especially me.

259
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:04,163
Hello, waffle iron!

260
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,082
Hello! What do
we have here?

261
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,000
Okay, so the recipe
says we need

262
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,002
a mixing bowl,
a measuring cup...

263
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,755
Get down.

264
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,842
It's the fuzz.

265
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,218
Do you want us
to get scolded?

266
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,555
Shut your beautiful,
beautiful mouth. Please.

267
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,102
"I got too much ice cream,
you want some?"

268
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,396
"Getting my fry on."

269
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,689
Boring.

270
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,399
"The moon is huge tonight."

271
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,192
Gosh, the moon one's damning.

272
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,569
Yeah, sorry.

273
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,195
That's regular text talk.

274
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,363
You forgot one.

275
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:38,990
"You're such a great friend."

276
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,283
With the dots.

277
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,077
"You're such a great friend,
dot, dot, dot, dot, dot."

278
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,455
Five dots, Darryl?
Are you kidding me?

279
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,041
Okay, 'cause three dots means
to be continued, four dots is a typo.

280
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,835
But five dots means,
"Whoa, do not

281
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,712
make me say what I
want to say, baby,

282
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,549
"but if I did, it would blow your
mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot."

283
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,593
See? Yes, thank you, sister.

284
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,554
Brandon, Darryl and me,
that's ridiculous.

285
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,639
Right?
Yeah.

286
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,393
Totally crazy. Puts me in an
insane asylum just thinking about it.

287
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,312
I'm stranded on
Shutter Island over here.

288
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,190
You look like Ed Harris.

289
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,984
If they stretched
him a little bit...

290
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,362
You wanna see a picture of me
trapped under a tree?

291
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,074
Uh...

292
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,410
Excuse me.

293
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,786
What? Not now. I'm busy.

294
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,079
I'm sorry,
I thought you'd want to know

295
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,331
that I saw
a bedbug in my room.

296
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,749
But never mind.
Sorry to interrupt.

297
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,334
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Bedbugs?

298
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,794
Oh, no.

299
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,717
Freak, I need a favor.

300
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,846
Well, then you have to call me
by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis.

301
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,931
I've gotta be gone
for a few minutes.

302
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,183
You make sure that Packer
does not sleep with Nellie.

303
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,393
What's in it for G.S.L.?

304
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,811
You really want
Packer as your boss?

305
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,104
Got it.

306
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,399
If Jim has bedbugs,
that means they're everywhere.

307
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,818
I can't risk them coming
back to Schrute Farms.

308
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,696
Our biggest attraction is our
200-hundred-year-old mattresses.

309
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,575
Where did you see it?
In the bed.

310
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,035
Well, I haven't seen anything.

311
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,746
We gotta find it
before it eggs.

312
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:09,914
Jeez!

313
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,876
Describe it.
Brown, shiny, painful bite.

314
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,044
Could be a bat weevil.

315
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,713
Describe its mood.
Did it seem sleepy?

316
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,299
Stressed, but to be fair,
it was a tense situation.

317
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,677
Fair enough. But after it bit
you, did it run away fearful?

318
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,179
Or did it walk away smug,
self-assured?

319
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,557
So smug. Like he thought
it was funny. Like this.

320
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,267
That's a bedbug.
Yeah.

321
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,019
Everything's a joke.
I know.

322
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,104
Check your hair!

323
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,525
God! It's so greasy. You
should just shave all this.

324
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,609
Just check it.

325
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,445
You are clean. Okay.

326
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,366
The one thing a bedbug thrives
on is heat and carbon dioxide.

327
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,161
I am gonna generate myself
into a human trap.

328
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,247
When I jump into the bed,
you are gonna

329
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,416
cover me with
the sheet immediately.

330
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,835
And then,
we'll see who's laughing.

331
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:56,961
All right!

332
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,505
Yeah!

333
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,756
Cover me!

334
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,091
Is this really necessary?

335
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,259
He knows what he's doing.

336
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,012
Let the bedbugs bite!

337
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,014
God! I feel so gross!
I have to go take a shower.

338
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,932
All right,
then I will catch you later.

339
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,184
What do we do now?

340
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,310
We wait.

341
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,731
Come to Papa!

342
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,191
No!

343
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,327
I don't know, Dwight.
I think maybe you should...

344
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,620
No, I wasn't bitten.

345
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,706
Okay, well, maybe it's not
warm enough in here.

346
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,790
It's plenty warm.

347
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,625
And I was farting continuously
under the sheet,

348
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,127
creating a kind of a
greenhouse effect. Come on.

349
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,754
If there were any
in here, they would

350
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,880
have imbedded
themselves in me.

351
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,631
You know what?
Maybe they just ate.

352
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,425
No, you're good.
Clean bill of health.

353
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,177
Besides, I gotta
get back downstairs.

354
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,679
I left Packer alone with
Nellie for way too long.

355
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,639
Okay, well, they're
fine, they're adults.

356
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,183
No. That's the problem.

357
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,811
Packer is trying to bed Nellie
for the V.P. job, unless I do it first.

358
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,313
Is that really how you
want to get this job?

359
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,065
Such a chorus girl.

360
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,693
Okay, Dwight? Dwight?
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight.

361
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,320
Uh...

362
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,366
Is "crazy" gone?

363
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,674
Oh...

364
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,013
They don't make these cords
in boot cut anymore!

365
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,683
Aw...

366
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,019
Pathetic, huh?

367
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,731
A real man swallows his vomit
when a lady is present.

368
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,403
Hey.

369
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,367
Yep, one Death by Chocolate,
one Bananas Foster.

370
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:52,910
Okay, cool. Thanks.

371
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,705
I know, I'm a pig, right?

372
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,500
Wait, this is why I
exercise like a fiend.

373
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,043
Feel. Seriously.

374
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,670
Okay. All right.

375
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,131
I'm really sorry.
I just have to say it.

376
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,632
I'm married.

377
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,509
I'm very happily married.

378
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,344
Oh, my God,
what are you thinking?

379
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,513
Um...

380
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,140
I mean...

381
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,600
I know that you're married,
I sat at your wife's desk.

382
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,686
How little do you
think of me?

383
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,107
I'm sorry, I feel like
maybe I misread things.

384
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,735
Okay. Let's just
go back to watching.

385
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,281
Can you, without running to the
other side of the room all night?

386
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,701
Yes. I can. Uh...

387
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,662
All right.
I'm really sorry.

388
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,581
I think we'll just...
We'll just watch.

389
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,207
You can watch, not watch,
whatever you wanna do.

390
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,334
Take another shower,
I don't care. Okay.

391
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,045
Whoo...

392
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,381
I am so cold.

393
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,180
Hey, Darryl, you okay?

394
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,723
She's got a boyfriend.

395
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,309
Play it cool, man.
She'll come around.

396
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,187
No, you should go for it. Mmm...

397
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,063
I mean, nothing would've
happened with me and Jim

398
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,398
if he didn't put
himself out there.

399
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:09,111
Yeah, but my friend Jim
would tell you to play it cool.

400
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,698
My husband would
tell you to go for it.

401
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,035
Hey. Hey.
Hey. Hey.

402
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,870
This is fun.
A lot of fun.

403
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,289
I know. Can I give
you a compliment?

404
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,708
I'm really impressed
by how much you've grown.

405
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,793
Since I met you,
it's like night and day.

406
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,213
You should move down
here with me! Yeah?

407
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,797
We could be roommates.
Really?

408
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,884
We could get a dog,
we could go to R-rated movies!

409
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,386
And who knows, I mean,
you're a guy, I'm a girl.

410
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,471
Yeah.

411
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,390
Maybe in six months,
we'll see. Six months!

412
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,893
Okay. I'm in love
with Kelly.

413
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,651
Put your forehead near mine and
see if you can read my thoughts.

414
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,444
Okay.

415
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,240
Seven, one, one...

416
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:58,118
Nine... No, no, no,
not numbers. No.

417
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,622
No, okay. Try again.

418
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,415
Okay.

419
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,795
I'm still getting numbers.
Seven, one, one...

420
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,507
Is anyone around here thinking
the numbers seven, one, one?

421
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,260
Please stop. Okay?

422
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,262
Dwight, give me
a key card to your room.

423
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:23,227
Meet me in seven minutes
for some one-on-one time.

424
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,520
Wait, the numbers.

425
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,111
There you go.
I will see you in seven...

426
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,904
Seven minutes.

427
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:43,914
Nellie, wait.

428
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,794
Let me write my room
number on the card.

429
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,716
Win at all costs.
Don't respect women.

430
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:57,386
These are the tenets I was brought
up with, and they have served me well.

431
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,806
But my ancestors never worked
in corporate America.

432
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,018
They were farmers,
and before that, hunters,

433
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:09,606
and before that, time travelers,
and before that, me again.

434
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,358
At least that's
how the legend goes.

435
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:14,570
The point is, they never had to
worry about how they got ahead.

436
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:18,365
They just had to put food on
the table and not alter the past.

437
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,786
1434-967, paid.

438
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,455
It has been processed.

439
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,165
It has been delivered.

440
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,001
That's it, last one.

441
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,503
Andy, this has been
an amazing night. Epic.

442
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,339
Cool down fiesta
begins right now.

443
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,466
I got decaf coffee.
No way.

444
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,344
I've got Romy and Michele's
High School Reunion.

445
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,429
Hey,

446
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,807
I just wanted to apologize.
I mean, that was so weird.

447
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,976
Can we just like
never talk about it again?

448
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,144
Sure.
Okay, thanks.

449
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,147
Hey, just so you know,
me and you,

450
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:55,319
I don't think that's ridiculous.
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.

451
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,668
All right. Now [ think
it's time for you to go.

452
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,546
What? Jim!

453
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,507
I thought we talked about
this. You're cool, right?

454
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,050
Cathy! Go.

455
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,220
Where's the bug?
Awesome!

456
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,013
Stand back!

457
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,099
Stop it! Oh, my gosh!
That burns! What is that?

458
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,601
It's a compound of chemicals
I pulled off of the maid's cart.

459
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,645
Oh, my God!
Dwight, there!

460
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,106
Oh, God! Stop it! Stop it!

461
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,399
Big one! Big one!

462
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,484
I think I saw it!
I think I saw it!

463
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,568
Stop it!

464
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,488
Nice job, I think
you got him.

465
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,366
You can't
stay here, this place is a biohazard.

466
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,660
If I were you,
I'd just bunk with Cathy.

467
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,672
Second best Bananas
Foster I've ever had.

468
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,507
Yeah, what's the first best?

469
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,220
Dwight?

470
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,514
Hello? Dwight?

471
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,641
- Is that Nellie?
- Don't!

472
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,101
Are you in there?

473
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,562
I can see the light
on under your door.

474
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,356
Hello?

475
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,942
Oh, look at that.

476
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,028
The light went off just
as I said the light went on.

477
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,867
Hello? Dwight?

478
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,164
Dwight?
