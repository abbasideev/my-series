1
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:04,087
Oh, for God's sake.

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,217
Planking is a very stupid
and dangerous trend.

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,428
Basically you lie like
a plank in weird places.

4
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,180
That's it.

5
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,806
Sometimes you get run over.

6
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,725
Welcome to the Internet.

7
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,603
Planking is one of
those things where,

8
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,272
hey, you either
get it or you don't.

9
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,443
And I don't. But I am so
excited to be a part of it.

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,864
After you,
my good sir.

11
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:31,948
No, I insist.

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,742
The search
committee finally decided,

13
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,535
after a lot of deliberation,

14
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,955
on Robert California
for the manager position.

15
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,959
Who took one look
around and left.

16
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:47,839
He drove down to Florida and
convinced Jo to make him C.E.O.

17
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,136
C.E.O. Her own job.

18
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,096
He talked her
out of her own job

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,015
and I don't really know
how someone does that,

20
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,310
but anyway, then the
position was his to fill,

21
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,562
and he chose...

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,237
It's unbelievable.

23
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,073
True. I may have
been the second choice,

24
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,367
but I was the first
choice's first choice.

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,743
And about Dwight,

26
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,746
I sense that he might have some
resentment about not getting the job,

27
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,164
so I sat him down
and we had a talk.

28
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:24,084
And I told him, "I need a
really strong number two.

29
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,418
"I want you to
be my enforcer."

30
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,545
Smart, right?
Very smart.

31
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,675
This has got to stop.

32
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,926
I can't get down.

33
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,844
Hey! Kevin!

34
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,933
Yeah, at first I was
really disappointed.

35
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,811
But I've got a great daily
routine going right now.

36
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,604
I've upped my karate
to eight times a week.

37
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,731
I've added boxing art
lunches and on weekends,

38
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,901
I do kick-boxing three times a
week, Krav Maga four times a week,

39
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,404
an hour of meditation
every morning at sunrise,

40
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,030
and again at sunset.

41
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,033
So yeah.
I'm doing great.

42
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,244
I'm going to need
some help. Pam?

43
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,912
I don't think I should.

44
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,791
Oh, yeah. Pregnant.

45
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,793
Right here.
Little Michael Scott.

46
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,170
Nope. I told you I
don't like that joke.

47
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,964
It is a boy.
We found out early.

48
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,675
Much different
the second time around.

49
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,802
And I have to say
it is nice not being

50
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,595
the only pregnant
woman in the office.

51
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:22,475
Look, it's "little
pregs" and "big pregs."

52
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,477
Wait, when did we
start calling each other...

53
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,147
Isn't it amazing the
difference in our sizes?

54
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,982
Well, I am a few
months ahead of you.

55
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,735
I'm having a child with
my husband, the senator.

56
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:36,406
And Pam is having a child
with Jim. The great salesman.

57
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,074
Hoist him aloft!

58
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,744
Come on, Darryl, lift.
Lift, Darryl.

59
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,120
Come on, man.

60
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,623
Yeah, I wanted the manager job,
but I got something much better.

61
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,210
This soda.

62
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,379
This is mine.

63
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:56,259
It might be easier if you take a
deep breath, lift from the knees,

64
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,886
and shove it
up your butt.

65
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,389
I came up with
a new thing this summer.

66
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,933
I act like I'm telling someone
how to do something.

67
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,354
I go on with a long
description and then I say...

68
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,147
And shove it up your butt.

69
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,444
It's stupid,
but it's my thing now.

70
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,821
No one should be
planking at all.

71
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,448
Thank you. Yes.

72
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,535
Dwight, my enforcer, my number
two, can you take care of this?

73
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,828
Say no more.

74
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,967
Kids, don't try planking,
it's dangerous.

75
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,304
Especially with me around.

76
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,503
Are you watching
that commercial again?

77
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,967
Why do you keep watching it if you
know it's just going to make you cry?

78
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,928
Because everything makes
me cry, so what's the difference?

79
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,850
This dog, he just wants
to protect his bone.

80
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,935
He's got a bank vault.
That's a start.

81
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:29,978
Not enough, though.

82
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,062
All right.

83
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,779
The new C.E.O. works out of the
conference room about half the time,

84
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:44,033
but whenever he takes a break, he
does these weird walks around the office.

85
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,244
And you never know who
he's going to Zero in on

86
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,496
for these really
intense small talks.

87
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,874
You just hope
it's not you.

88
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,336
And yet you hope it
is you, too. It's strange.

89
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,720
Here we go.
Hello.

90
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,890
Robert California.
Let's have a conversation.

91
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,808
Describe your day so far.

92
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,602
Well, I woke up and...

93
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,021
When you recount your
day, never say you woke up.

94
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,314
It's a waste of your time.

95
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,400
That's how every day has begun
for everyone since the dawn of man.

96
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,819
Very smart.
Very smart.

97
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:25,074
Suddenly, I was awake
and ...

98
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:30,788
Hey, Robert. We have that 9:30
A.M. casual chit chat scheduled.

99
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,375
I emailed you about it last night
to confirm. And again this morning.

100
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,461
First item on the agenda,
can I get everyone

101
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,505
an extra long
Columbus Day weekend?

102
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,924
Item number two,
connect with the guy.

103
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,302
Robert California,
what does he think of me?

104
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,762
Don't know.
Super care.

105
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,557
Number three, time permitting,
we lost our biggest client.

106
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,906
Pam. Pam. Psst! Pam.

107
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,172
Jim.

108
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,435
Can I call you right back?
Thank you very much.

109
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,771
Okay.

110
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,234
What is this?

111
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,406
The Friday before
Columbus Day, thoughts?

112
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,615
What are your thoughts?

113
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,033
Just making chit-chat.

114
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,371
Kind of a medium year
for women's soccer, no?

115
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,542
What are you looking at?

116
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,711
It's nothing.

117
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,921
It can't be nothing.
Yeah, it can't be nothing.

118
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,632
It's just a list of our names
split into two columns.

119
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,175
What?

120
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,845
Okay, just wait one
second, all right? I will copy it.

121
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,180
Do you have a pen?
No.

122
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,307
No.

123
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,310
Okay. Um, I'll take
a photo of it.

124
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,728
Dwight, can you
throw me my phone?

125
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,191
Nice catch.

126
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,360
If he comes out,
distract him.

127
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,446
We need a warning signal.

128
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,239
We don't need
a warning signal, Kevin.

129
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,449
We can see him right
there. - We do.

130
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,533
I promise you we
don't need a...

131
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,786
Warning! Warning!
Warning! Warning! Warning!

132
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,622
Phyllis!
Phyllis!

133
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,916
You okay?

134
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,712
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah.

135
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,213
One, two, three.

136
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,340
Thanks, guys.

137
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:52,096
Okay. Which side
of the list am I on?

138
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,223
Yes!
Left.

139
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,559
Why are you...
How do you know?

140
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,937
Really great
list of names, guys.

141
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,357
Thank you so much.
Good work.

142
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,151
No, actually, that was
in Robert's notebook.

143
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,236
He left it at reception
and we photocopied it.

144
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,655
Oh!

145
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,699
Okay. I don't want
any part of this.

146
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,160
Maybe it's the list of people
he's going to fire.

147
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,663
Okay.
It's not that, Pam.

148
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,998
You know, I was
thinking it reminds me

149
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,541
of those lists
Dwight used to make.

150
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,418
This is if we were all
on a cruise ship

151
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,253
and had to divide
into life boats.

152
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,880
And this is if we
were on a cruise ship

153
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,715
and had to divide
into life rafts.

154
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:32,261
Here's something. "Who would
eat who in an Alive situation?"

155
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,684
No. That can't be it.

156
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,726
I gotta say,

157
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,813
it kind of seems like the
left side is the side to be on.

158
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,857
Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl,
no offense, Pam.

159
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,609
I don't think...
Excuse me?

160
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,653
Shh. Pam, come on.
Don't be such a right-sider.

161
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,782
Did you guys figure it
out? We couldn't crack it.

162
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,451
Go in there, just ask
the man what it means.

163
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,747
He'll know that we looked
at his private notebook.

164
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,291
Come on. Just say you
saw the list by accident.

165
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,711
I'm already working on this
Columbus Day thing for you guys.

166
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,213
And it's starting
to stack up.

167
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,881
It feels like a lot.
One thing at a time.

168
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,926
Yeah, that's all you had to do
today is ask about Columbus Day?

169
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,392
Yes. For God's sake,
Andy, yes. Come in.

170
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,938
What's up?

171
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,441
Weird thing.
Totally awkward.

172
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,069
But you left your notebook
on the reception desk.

173
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,195
Great. Thank you.

174
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,948
And it was open,

175
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,118
and people saw this,

176
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,162
and they're just kind
of going nuts and, like...

177
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,246
What is this?

178
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,289
...wondering what it is.

179
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,416
It's a photocopy
from your notebook.

180
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:47,128
You read my notebook? And
photocopied it and distributed it?

181
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:53,634
No. They did. And they
asked me to ask you about it.

182
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,678
Please.

183
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,015
Oh.

184
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,058
Here's what it is,
it's a doodle.

185
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,602
What?

186
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,022
Some people doodle at work
when they let their mind run.

187
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,648
They draw houses, penises,

188
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,735
funny how the houses
are always colonials

189
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,528
and the penises are
always circumcised.

190
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,572
Don't you think?

191
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:19,202
Well, I doodle too but I'm not
an artist so I draw words and lists.

192
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,706
That is fascinating.

193
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,917
And by the way,
I am so glad I asked.

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,586
People were just sort of...
Did you just move my name?

195
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,464
Might as well have
been sketching a cube.

196
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,055
Okay, Robert's in the annex,
everybody think quick.

197
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,473
What do these
groups have in common?

198
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,475
Maybe we're supposed to
do it with people in our group.

199
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,851
That's not it.

200
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,102
People in
the other group.

201
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,521
Mmm. Still wrong.

202
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,357
Stanley, you do puzzles
all day. What do we got?

203
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,651
Well, you take the first
letter from each name,

204
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,111
assign it a number,
add them all up,

205
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,863
and shove it up your butt.

206
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,324
Thank you, a little
much needed comic relief.

207
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,701
But we really need to
figure this out, guys.

208
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,119
I know.

209
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,539
It's alphabetical.

210
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,458
No, it's not.

211
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,543
Here's how we find out.

212
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,294
Let's line up and
compare the lines,

213
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,629
see if we learn
anything, okay?

214
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,090
Left-siders over here,
right-siders line up over here,

215
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,174
face each other.

216
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,677
Match up by height
and relative weight.

217
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,138
Let's just size
each other up here.

218
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,724
And left side of the list,

219
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,768
attack!

220
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,937
Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop!

221
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,605
Will you stop?

222
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:31,858
Dwight!

223
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,109
Don't do it!

224
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:34,944
What are you doing?
Stop!

225
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,114
Warning! Warning! Warning!

226
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:47,999
I'd like to invite the following
people to join me for lunch.

227
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,501
Jim, Dwight,

228
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,254
Angela, Darryl,

229
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,800
Kevin, Toby,
Phyllis, Oscar.

230
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,430
That's great.
Let's do this, guys.

231
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,268
All right. Well,
I will see you in a bit.

232
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,561
I love you so much.

233
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:12,231
Hey, it's nothing,
all right?

234
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,733
I'll text you
when we get there.

235
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,776
I'll let you know
what's going on. Okay.

236
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,653
No. No dog video.

237
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,155
Okay.
Okay.

238
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:20,990
See you, guys.

239
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,370
Well, we should all
be really excited about

240
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:30,207
our very own pizza party.

241
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,254
Pizza party! Pizza
party. Pizza party.

242
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:38,549
Jim, your daughter Cecelia,
what does she think of the Street?

243
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,134
The street?

244
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,344
Sesame Street.

245
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,429
Oh. I didn't know
anybody called it...

246
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,764
She likes it a lot.

247
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,390
She loves Elmo.

248
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,768
Elmo, God save us, the Elmo era.

249
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,852
Right?

250
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,604
Sesame Street was
created to reflect

251
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,272
the environment of
the children watching it.

252
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,983
Complete self
absorption of Elmo

253
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,985
is brilliantly
reflective of our time.

254
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:01,155
Ours is a cultural ghetto.
Wouldn't you agree?

255
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,742
Yeah. She does like Elmo.

256
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,995
Cultural ghetto?
Totally agree.

257
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,163
Completely.

258
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,707
Apt. Apt analysis, Robert.

259
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,544
The thing that I like
about Elmo is the tickling.

260
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,633
I should not be here. I don't
know. I was in the wrong...

261
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,386
I'm... I'm sorry.

262
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,347
Just picture me back
there. I was never here.

263
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,561
Great group.
Pizza party.

264
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,729
How is this a pizza party?

265
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,022
Well, why don't you
ask me again

266
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,273
when the five pizzas
get here?

267
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,441
Yeah, well,
that's just pizza.

268
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,652
You need at least one other
element for it to be a party.

269
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,487
Okay. Have you guys
ever had margherita pizza?

270
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,571
What's that?

271
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,742
Fresh tomato with a dollop
of mozzarella cheese.

272
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,994
That's pizza.

273
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,954
That's regular pizza.

274
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,665
You know, I feel comfortable
enough now to ask you this question,

275
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,334
what made you
pick this group?

276
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,253
I just think
you guys are winners

277
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,504
and I wanted to
have lunch with you.

278
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,672
Okay.

279
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,840
Aw.

280
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,050
What about the other guys?

281
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,678
Losers? Come on.
Oh, I don't know.

282
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,179
Come on. Come on.

283
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,931
I guess I think
they're losers.

284
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,434
I knew it.

285
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,518
Yes!

286
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,061
Probably shouldn't
have said that.

287
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,688
Whoo-hoo!

288
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,816
Ah-ha! Their interpretation
of margherita pizza.

289
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,777
Fans of classic pizza
will be psyched.

290
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,656
A text from Jim.

291
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,451
"This is getting very weird.
Will explain later."

292
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,331
Text from Kevin.

293
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,541
"Suck it, losers."

294
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,840
Okay, not to point
out the glaringly obvious,

295
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,259
but doesn't the fact
that I'm in this group

296
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,636
make anyone feel just
a little bit better?

297
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,556
Oh, this crust is sharp!

298
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,311
I used to be young and cute
and sort of funny

299
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,230
and I could do those
cute little cartoons

300
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,817
and everyone who came
through here was like,

301
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,986
"Who's that receptionist?
I like her."

302
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,530
Now I'm just a fat mom.

303
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,035
Yeah, and you take one look at
me and you're like, "Oh, loser."

304
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,661
Come here, Pam.

305
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,247
Chins up, okay?

306
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,833
Bad joke.

307
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,544
Look around this room.

308
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,172
Does this look like a
group of losers? Seriously.

309
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,764
Oh, God.

310
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,769
Oh, hey, guys,
we had so much fun.

311
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,187
We had margherita pizza.

312
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,939
We all hung out and got
to know each other better.

313
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:40,981
How was your lunch?

314
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,983
It was excellent.
Good times.

315
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,235
Yeah?
Yeah.

316
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,237
Oh, we did.
It was the best time.

317
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,949
And you know what? Now it's
over, back to work, everyone.

318
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,034
You too, Andy.

319
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,661
I knew it.

320
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:57,790
I just knew my whole life that
everyone was wrong about me.

321
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:03,295
My parents, my teachers, my
friends, the doctors, everyone.

322
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,215
Well, that was
certainly an odd lunch.

323
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,720
Is everything all right?

324
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,014
Yeah, I'm fine.

325
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,855
Just take the
casserole out of the...

326
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,981
Loser.

327
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,316
Take it out of the
refrigerator, put it in the oven.

328
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,069
It'll be fine. Just leave
it in for 20 minutes.

329
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,321
Loser.

330
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,698
When I was a salesman,
I could just be like,

331
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:34,660
"Not my job, not my prob. I'm going
to the warehouse to polish my knob."

332
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,079
Metaphorically, of course.

333
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:41,250
But now,
it is my job and my prob.

334
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,085
Hi, Robert.

335
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,922
Can you come out here,
please? It's really important.

336
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,345
I just wanted to
clarify something.

337
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,725
Some people here
are under the misconception

338
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:02,188
that some people
may be considered,

339
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,315
let's say top tier,

340
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,151
and others would
be second tier.

341
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,527
I never said that.

342
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,362
Thank you. Great.

343
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,115
I said winners and losers. Is
that what you're talking about?

344
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,870
Oh, that might... That actually
might be what I'm thinking of.

345
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,622
Can you clarify that?

346
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,124
Let me tell you some
things I find productive.

347
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,961
Positive reinforcement,

348
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,297
negative reinforcement.

349
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:29,924
Honesty.

350
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,885
I'll tell you some things
I find unproductive.

351
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,347
Constantly worrying
about where you stand

352
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,557
based on
inscrutable social clues,

353
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:42,186
and then inevitably reframing
it all in a reassuring way

354
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,729
so that you can get
to sleep at night.

355
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,607
No, I do not
believe in that at all.

356
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,652
If I invited you to lunch,
I think you're a winner.

357
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,111
If I didn't, I don't.

358
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,947
But I just met you all.

359
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,407
Life is long,
opinions change.

360
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:59,787
Winners, prove me right.
Losers, prove me wrong.

361
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,463
Well, I guess
that's that.

362
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,547
No.

363
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,551
No. No.

364
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,264
Andy, don't go in there.

365
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,890
I'm going in there.

366
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:29,149
I know that every time I talk to
you things just seem to get worse.

367
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,778
But you don't know
these people, and I do.

368
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,531
And if I let you work
with faulty information,

369
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,033
well, then I'm not doing
my job as regional manager.

370
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:43,038
So, please take this pen
and change your list.

371
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,999
I'm not going to
change my list, Andy.

372
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,959
And I don't use
ballpoint pens.

373
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,547
Well, then I will
make a new list for you.

374
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,805
Stanley, you may think
he's a lazy grump,

375
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,725
but did you know that he has the
most consistently high sales numbers

376
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,143
of anyone in this office?

377
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,145
And you may think
he's hard to love,

378
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,813
but did you know
that he's in not one,

379
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,065
but two long-term
romantic relationships?

380
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,402
I did not know
about the sales figures.

381
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,696
Meredith Palmer,
supplier relations.

382
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,824
The word "no,"
not even in her vocabulary.

383
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,200
And just to show you
that I'm being fair,

384
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,493
you had Gabe in
the loser column,

385
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,580
I think that is astute.

386
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,415
Good call.

387
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,000
Pam,

388
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:33,922
easily the most creative and kind
person I have ever worked with.

389
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,008
Jim, shut the door.
This is just gross.

390
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,092
Shh.

391
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,596
Erin Hannon, the receptionist,
and my closest confidant.

392
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,681
A winner if
there ever was one.

393
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,391
I like my new group.

394
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,771
I liked my old group.

395
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,897
Are we done?

396
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,981
Yes.

397
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,232
No.

398
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,068
The Friday
before Columbus Day,

399
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,611
we're going to
take a half-day.

400
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,613
So that everyone can get a
jump on the long weekend.

401
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,616
You want a three-and-a-half
day weekend for Columbus Day?

402
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,743
Yes, I do.

403
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,871
And you are aware that
Columbus and his legions

404
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:09,625
committed genocide against an
entire civilization of Native Americans?

405
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,961
I don't care.

406
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,806
Hey, guys,

407
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:28,060
so Columbus Day, we
got that half-day on Friday.

408
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,853
We get that every year.

409
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,314
Well, you got it
this year, too.

410
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,443
Good night, Andy.
Good night.

411
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,778
Bye.

412
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,781
Good night, Andy.

413
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,619
Good night.

414
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,787
Night.

415
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,467
All right, I'm going
to go warm up the car.

416
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:01,969
Okay.
Okay.

417
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,848
You dropped something. Jim?

418
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,726
Okay, I know I've been
crying easily today, but...

419
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,940
I mean, that's just
pretty killer, right?

420
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,111
I mean,
maybe it's stupid.

421
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,405
No.

422
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,741
It's wonderful.

423
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,577
I'm going to frame it.

424
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,206
I can always un-frame it.
