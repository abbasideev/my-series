1
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,381
This is Pam.

2
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:12,137
Oh, my God, are you sure?
Okay, okay, we'll be right there.

3
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,014
Everybody!

4
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,724
- The balloon is falling!
- What?

5
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,351
There's this balloon
that has been floating

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,353
in the rafters of the
warehouse for, like, ever.

7
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,479
And...

8
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,441
Okay, it's not, it doesn't sound
cool, you just have to see it.

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,113
Well, I guess it doesn't
look that cool either.

10
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,490
But it's been up there
a long time,

11
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,951
so it's become
a pretty big deal.

12
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,955
Wow. It's the end
of an era.

13
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,749
You did
a good job, buddy.

14
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,792
Now it's time
to come home.

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,214
I remember when that balloon
went up there. I was still with Gil.

16
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,257
We were so happy.

17
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,636
When that went up there,
I had hair like Rapunzel.

18
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,598
How long do you think
it's been up there, Kevin?

19
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:00,810
I just remember pushing aside
my silky bangs to say,

20
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,146
"Look, a balloon."

21
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:06,066
My Warcraft clan was
still on speaking terms.

22
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,235
My kid didn't
have a face tattoo.

23
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,737
I was still thinking
of going back to school.

24
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,989
And I was still
just a paper salesman.

25
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:17,410
This has been fun, Pam.
Thanks for calling us all down here.

26
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,292
Kill the balloon!
Kill the balloon!

27
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,754
Kill the balloon!
Kill the balloon!

28
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,311
Hey!

29
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,897
So they accidentally gave us an
extra egg sandwich this morning.

30
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,066
- Who wants it?
- Ooh! Right here.

31
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,276
Right here! Pick me!

32
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,069
Allow me to solve
your problem then.

33
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,487
Nellie.

34
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,697
Mmm.

35
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,369
Ugh! That is disgusting.

36
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,497
Do you call that a King
James breakfast pie?

37
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,165
What brings you to town?

38
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:09,296
Certainly not the Harry Houdini
museum. What a nobody!

39
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,299
"Oh, look, some Hungarian
just found their way out of a sack,

40
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,050
"let's build a shrine."

41
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,302
No, I've come
to work here.

42
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,511
What?

43
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:20,098
How could Robert transfer Nellie
here after the Sabre store debacle?

44
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,891
She stinks of failure.

45
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,060
The fact that she could
show her face around here

46
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,687
is an embarrassment.

47
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,773
I should know. I'm in
an identical situation.

48
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,068
Robert did say you'd be
joining us. Welcome, I'm Tony.

49
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,029
What?

50
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,989
I said, "I'm Tony."

51
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,867
Okay, I made a mistake. I
thought it might go unnoticed.

52
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,036
But, I'm Toby.

53
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,246
You messed up
saying your name?

54
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,831
It happens, okay?

55
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,042
So let's just find
an empty desk for you

56
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,837
and I'm sure Robert will be
with you as soon as he gets in.

57
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,921
That one looks empty.

58
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,548
No. It's Andy's office.

59
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,759
Oh, is it?

60
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,429
I have one simple
philosophy in business,

61
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,098
if the seat is open,
the job is open.

62
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,435
It's how I came to briefly
race a Formula One car.

63
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,647
The three slowest laps
ever recorded.

64
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,278
Another beautiful day
in Tallahassee.

65
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,530
Good morning, Alonzo!

66
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,032
Good morning, Erin!

67
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,743
How are you?
How's your family doing?

68
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,079
Bye.

69
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,291
Look at this place. Five rooms
and I get to clean them all.

70
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,211
That's right. I'm a
maid for an old lady.

71
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:35,173
Her grandson's staying with us,
too, because he ran out of money.

72
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,009
Listen to me,
bragging away.

73
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,846
Nellie.
Robert.

74
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:47,060
How are you adjusting
to life in Scranton so far?

75
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,980
So far, so good! The water
pressure in the hotel is marvelous.

76
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:56,903
It is astounding what a
difference that can make, isn't it?

77
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:57,987
Mmm-hmm.

78
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,825
Now, let's find you something
fun to do here, shall we?

79
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,952
Oh, I've already found it.

80
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,789
I am manager, a natural
next step. It fits like a glove.

81
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,374
We have a manager.

82
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,794
Do you really?
Because it is 10:00,

83
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,754
I've been in this
chair for an hour

84
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,674
and no other manager
has come and sat on my lap.

85
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,722
Excuse me, has anyone
seen Andy this morning?

86
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,269
Yeah, that's weird. He's
usually here by now. Right, guys?

87
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,772
Hello?
Andy, it's Robert.

88
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,441
Why aren't you at work?

89
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,777
Hey, Robert, I really wish I
could come into work today

90
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,362
but I'm super sick.

91
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,282
I don't care.
I don't care.

92
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,701
Please come to
work immediately.

93
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:49,038
Okay, I'll try to come in,
even though I'm really sick

94
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,168
with the Florida flu!

95
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,297
He just hung up
on me mid-sentence.

96
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,299
I'm in Florida to get Erin.

97
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,967
As soon as I heard she
wasn't coming back to Scranton,

98
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,095
I jumped straight in my car and
drove straight down until I hit the ocean.

99
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,889
My heart is my map.

100
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,726
Turns out Tallahassee is about
two hundred miles inland,

101
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,395
so I overshot a good amount.

102
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,273
But still, not bad
for a heart map, right?

103
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:18,985
Ew.

104
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,405
Thanks a lot, BP.

105
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,867
Not much we can do about this
until he gets here.

106
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,202
Can't you do
something about this?

107
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,705
Sometimes the flowers
arrange themselves, Jim.

108
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,001
Right.

109
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,046
What is going on,
and where's Andy?

110
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,465
And what is going on?

111
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,884
Erin, you got a package!

112
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,636
I'm in the bathroom!

113
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,263
Where's the postage? I
mean there's no shipping label.

114
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,932
Did you wash your hands?

115
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,600
Yes.

116
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:56,439
Here I am, signed,
sealed, delivered I'm yours

117
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,191
Andy, what are you
doing here?

118
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,109
It's great to see you.

119
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,070
Ah!

120
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:06,699
Uh, I am here to take
you back to Scranton

121
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,869
because I love you and
I want to be with you.

122
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,829
Where's the ring?

123
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,039
Hmm?

124
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,666
Where's the ring, Lancelot?

125
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,210
Would you guys mind if we
talked privately for a second?

126
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,420
Sorry, Glenn.

127
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,217
Um.

128
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,137
Andy, I am so happy to see you,

129
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,181
but I'm not
coming back with you.

130
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,767
Why won't
she go with him?

131
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:36,646
I don't know. Maybe it's
because he's not that handsome.

132
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,814
Hey.

133
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,691
Don't listen.

134
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,780
So what is going on?

135
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,575
That does seem to be
the question, doesn't it?

136
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:54,038
"Hey, this
is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady?"

137
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,083
I know. It's a lot.

138
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,337
So, who knows what's
going on? Anyone?

139
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,466
You, yes, wait. I am
very good intuiting names.

140
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,137
Is it Chumbo?

141
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,476
I think it's a cross between
"dumbo” and "jumbo,"

142
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,020
with a hint of "chubby."

143
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,689
It's not a name.

144
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,941
So no one can tell me
what's going on?

145
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,236
Well, let me
illuminate things for you.

146
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,488
We are getting to
know each other.

147
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,199
"But why, my lady?"

148
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,703
Because I am
your new manager.

149
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,624
Robert, is Nellie
our new manager?

150
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,169
This is an odd situation.

151
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,797
But it's very interesting
how it's playing out.

152
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,968
We live in this world
of routines and rhythms.

153
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:52,472
Kevin ate someone's lunch,
Phyllis has a new necklace.

154
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,266
Who is this woman?

155
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,312
I came in here simply trying to
get to know you, learn your names,

156
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,606
maybe have someone teach me
the company song.

157
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:05,485
And what I got in return
was nothing but disrespect.

158
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,111
You leave me no choice

159
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,988
but to get to know you
in a more intimate way.

160
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,323
Hot tub party?

161
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,325
Performance reviews.

162
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,078
How can you give us performance
reviews if you don't know us?

163
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:19,374
On first impressions,
so I recommend smiling.

164
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,626
It goes a long way with me.

165
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,589
Erin, you really
nailed the hot dogs today.

166
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,385
Thanks. I've been reusing the
hot dog water, so it gets more flavor.

167
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,136
It's only going to
keep getting better.

168
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:38,059
So, Andrew, how does your
skinny brunette girlfriend, Jessica,

169
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,937
feel about you
visiting your ex-girlfriend?

170
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,194
Well, we're not
really dating anymore,

171
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,530
so basically,
I mean I just have to

172
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,657
cross a few t's and
dot a few i's, you know.

173
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:57,078
So you came to get me,
but you still have a girlfriend.

174
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,039
I think you should leave,
young man.

175
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:05,128
All right, technically yes. I am
still technically dating Jessica.

176
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,588
But when I realized
that I wanted you back,

177
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,633
I just jumped in a car
and I drove down here

178
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,969
and I didn't want to stop
until I saw you.

179
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,848
You didn't even
stop to pee? Gross!

180
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,391
Any luck?

181
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:22,061
No, he just keeps letting
all the calls go to voicemail.

182
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,648
Please leave a message

183
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,901
for Andy Bernard
Include your name...

184
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,906
Oh, you're doing so good! Oh, my
God, you're Superman over there.

185
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,242
You should take it.

186
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,078
It's probably your girlfriend
wondering where you are.

187
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,205
Nope. It's just work.
Not important.

188
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,124
You know I can really
feel this in my quads.

189
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,584
I can tell I'm
getting stronger.

190
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,087
You really wouldn't feel those
kinds of results after one session.

191
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,255
I don't know, it's...

192
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,133
Just let it vibrate.
It's fine.

193
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,093
You could put it
on silent.

194
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,762
I don't think
it does that.

195
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,680
Just go to preferences,
then click...

196
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,806
Proctology.

197
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,308
Andy?

198
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,934
Jim?

199
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,019
Andy, where are you?

200
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,690
I'm home in bed.
I've been in bed all day.

201
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,110
I got the serious poops, man.

202
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,614
He's here in Tallahassee,
trying to turn my life upside down.

203
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,033
What? You're in Florida?

204
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,327
Andy, Nellie Bertram's
trying to take your job.

205
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,661
What do you mean,
take my job?

206
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,038
Like, set up camp
in your office

207
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,164
and is calling
herself the manager.

208
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,540
Okay.

209
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,959
Jim, I really appreciate
you looking out for me

210
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,712
but I'm not coming home
without Erin.

211
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,047
So, I'll talk to you later.

212
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,508
Guys!

213
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,178
We cannot do these
performance reviews, okay?

214
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,471
If we go into them,
you're basically

215
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,847
accepting Nellie
as your manager.

216
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,058
And trust me. You do not
want her as your manager.

217
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,518
Trust you?

218
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,230
The way Pam trusted you to provide
for her so she wouldn't have to work?

219
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,315
I like working here.

220
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,942
Dwight,
should she be our manager?

221
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,820
I wouldn't let her
manage a celery farm.

222
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,364
Those who can't farm,
farm celery.

223
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,867
And when was the last time Dwight
and I agreed on anything ever?

224
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,870
All right,
let's get going.

225
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:07,500
First up, it is the woman with the
beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet.

226
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,252
Phyllis.

227
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,005
Nellie, I'm sorry,
but I don't feel comfortable

228
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,174
being evaluated by
someone I don't know.

229
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,342
Oh.

230
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,679
Okay. I understand. Let me show
you how these are going to go.

231
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,180
Dwight.

232
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,975
I refuse to be judged by
someone that I do not respect.

233
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,351
I lost respect for you
in Florida.

234
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,645
If it was up to me,
you would be in jail forever.

235
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,690
Dwight, I have
completed your evaluation.

236
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,858
You're getting a raise.

237
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,984
What?

238
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:37,905
Dwight, you carry this company
on your massive shoulders.

239
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,741
You are our Atlas

240
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,578
and for that, do you not
think you deserve a raise?

241
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,872
There's no limit to
what I think I deserve.

242
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,956
Then you accept it?

243
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,499
Five percent, no less!

244
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,792
Absolutely not.

245
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,085
Seven percent.

246
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,503
Six percent!
I know my worth.

247
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,130
Raise isn't real.

248
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,382
Money isn't real, ever since
we got off the gold standard.

249
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,719
So, Phyllis, now you
know the rules of the game,

250
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,681
do you care to have a go? I'm
fairly certain you're going to like it.

251
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,725
Phyllis.

252
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,435
Pam.

253
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,482
So, Phyllis, I have been
very impressed with you.

254
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,943
Really?
Oh, yeah.

255
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,988
The way you conquered
your fear and came in here,

256
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,032
and now the way
you sit there.

257
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,660
All very impressive!

258
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,747
Um...

259
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,168
Are you aware that
Nellie is giving out raises?

260
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,004
I am not. How?

261
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,299
Yeah, she gave one
to Dwight, Phyllis...

262
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,593
Let me guess,
you want one, too.

263
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,720
Take the family
to Disney Town.

264
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:43,930
Land! World!

265
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,807
It's not that I don't want...
Well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise.

266
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,267
That's not what I'm saying.
That's not... Sorry.

267
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:53,481
Jim, I told Andy to come in
and yet he is still not in.

268
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:59,320
By contrast, Nellie Bertram
saw a vacuum and filled it.

269
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,531
I make no mention
of her business experience

270
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:06,035
or her relationship
with Jo Bennett, my boss.

271
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,038
Jim, would you prefer a nature
metaphor or a sexual metaphor?

272
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,289
Oh, God, nature, please.

273
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,333
When two animals
are having sex,

274
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,795
one of them is communicating
a message to the other.

275
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,047
Nothing is...
This isn't very helpful.

276
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,508
You're going to want
to hear the sexual metaphor.

277
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,592
Was that not the...

278
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:25,012
All life is sex.

279
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,474
And all sex is competition.

280
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,767
Mmm-hmm.

281
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,811
And there are no
rules to that game.

282
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,522
That wasn't so perverted,
now was it?

283
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,232
Was that it?
No, that wasn't bad.

284
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:42,029
My point is there is one person in
charge of every office in America.

285
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,490
And that person
is Charles Darwin.

286
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:48,369
In the end, doesn't he
decide who the manager is?

287
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,584
No. I would have said no.

288
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,298
Hmm. Let's see. Review,
review, review! Yes, good stuff.

289
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,717
Here you go, have a raise.

290
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,176
Oh, great!

291
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,972
I mean if we go in there and take
these raises, what are we saying?

292
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,225
That it's okay for someone to
just take someone else's job?

293
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,601
Shouldn't work like that.

294
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,187
No, you know what?
Nellie's right.

295
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,523
That is exactly
how it should work.

296
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,026
Darryl,
this office is mine now.

297
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,068
Yes!

298
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,236
Yes!

299
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,320
Yes.

300
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,363
Yes.

301
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,448
Yes.

302
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,160
Yes. Sorry, it's too late. I'm
here. This is mine. Back off.

303
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,871
Ow! Ow!

304
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,458
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

305
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,549
Well fought!
I accept the outcome.

306
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,554
Touch me and I'll sue.

307
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,851
I've heard that's
amazing when it works.

308
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,061
Yeah. If I had my own...

309
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,604
Andy, I care about
you and I think...

310
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,564
Sorry. You go.

311
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,690
No, go ahead.

312
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,609
Well, I was just
going to say that

313
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,360
if I had my own fountain
it would be two frogs

314
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,446
and they're spitting
into each other's mouth.

315
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,324
It's just stupid. What
were you going to say?

316
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,201
Andy, you broke my heart.

317
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:14,622
Do you know what it feels like
to be constantly rejected by you

318
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:18,209
and to have to watch
you date someone else?

319
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,919
You broke my heart, too.

320
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:24,006
You broke my heart more
recently and more often.

321
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,053
And I think at some point in
my head it just sort of clicked

322
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,222
that we're not
meant to be.

323
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,313
I'm so sorry that we have not
loved each other at the same time.

324
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,108
I know.

325
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,293
So, Pamela, I'm
going to start this review

326
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,420
not by telling you
what you lack,

327
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,549
but rather asking you
what it is you want.

328
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,093
Really? Okay, well!

329
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:10,636
Um...

330
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:16,308
I like consistency in the manager's
position. No weird silent coups.

331
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,685
Stuff like that,
I'm easy.

332
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,019
That's not
really what you want.

333
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,398
What you want is a good night's
sleep, working mother of two.

334
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,607
Whoa.

335
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,778
That's kind of condescending. Would
you say something like that to Jim?

336
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,239
Does Jim
have to breastfeed?

337
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:34,368
Did Jim carry around those
babies for, what is it, 12 months?

338
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,245
Be honest. Does Jim
really get up in the night?

339
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,541
Well, I mean, the only reason he
doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding

340
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,501
and Philip
doesn't like a bottle.

341
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,420
You must be exhausted.

342
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,589
Fancy a nap?

343
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,507
No.

344
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,384
Go on. Have a nap.

345
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,182
Lie down right here.

346
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,393
There's a blanket in here.

347
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,479
I used it earlier myself.

348
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,774
Dreamt I could breathe
underwater like Jacques Cousteau.

349
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,197
No one will know.

350
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,116
I'll wake you up.

351
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,122
When you wake up,
you will earn more money.

352
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,710
I think you're a witch.

353
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:29,632
I think you're amazing.
You know that, right?

354
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:35,387
Go on. Say it,
“I'm amazing."

355
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,098
I'm amazing.

356
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,861
Erin, I think you're making
a big mistake right now.

357
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,739
Andy is a nice boy.

358
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,326
Really? Because you've been
kind of a "B" to him all afternoon.

359
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,871
I was protecting you because
I thought he was no good.

360
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,499
But I can tell
you really like him.

361
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,834
And he's willing to
lose his job for you.

362
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,462
In this economy,
with Europe on the brink...

363
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,881
Irene, what would
you do without me?

364
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,467
We're not your concern,
sweetheart.

365
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,762
Besides, Glenn's
going to sue Home Depot.

366
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,888
Why?

367
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,433
He got his foreskin caught
in some lawn furniture.

368
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,270
Jim, time for
your review.

369
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,855
No, it's not, because
you don't really work here.

370
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,191
Why are you so
staunchly defending

371
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,610
your friend who
has abandoned you?

372
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:37,658
Wouldn't you rather come talk with
me, maybe, definitely get a raise?

373
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,784
See, that's the thing.

374
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,494
I don't know if you
can even give raises.

375
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:44,498
Jim, have you ever heard of a
character named Tinker Bell?

376
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,209
Yes.
I'm Tinker Bell.

377
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,877
No.

378
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,923
I'm a magical fairy
who floated into your office

379
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:58,679
to bring a little bit of magic into
your lives, to give you all raises.

380
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,514
And we are grateful.

381
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,809
But here's the thing
about Tinker Bell, Jim,

382
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:08,105
everyone has to believe in her
or she doesn't exist.

383
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,940
And then she dies.
She dies.

384
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:15,821
Now who here
believes in Tinker Bell?

385
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,198
Let's see it. Show
of hands! I do.

386
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,703
Come on, everyone!

387
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,079
All right, guys, stop!

388
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,040
I already spent the money.
How?

389
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,542
Come on,
Jim, you're killing her!

390
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,668
We believe!

391
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,087
We believe!

392
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,300
Look at this
wonderful recognition

393
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,761
of Nellie's leadership.
I believe!

394
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,937
That did not go
how I wanted it to.

395
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,607
Ugh!

396
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,235
I have a whole ton of Erin's
favorite food for the drive back.

397
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,945
Eggplant parm!

398
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,951
It's biodegradable.
Animals will eat it.

399
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,789
Andy, wait! Andy!

400
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,249
Andy, wait! Andy, don't go!

401
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,959
Andy, I love you! Stop!

402
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,922
Oh. This is the wrong Prius.
I don't love you.

403
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,298
Erin!
I'm sorry.

404
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,552
Andy.

405
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,527
Let's get out of here.

406
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,569
Okay.
Let's go.

407
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,321
Wait, we have to go back
and get your stuff.

408
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,447
No, I don't have
any stuff.

409
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,324
Like your toothbrush
and stuff. I don't have one.

410
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,326
You don't have a toothbrush? No.

411
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,247
How do you not
have a toothbrush?

412
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,082
I just, there's
always one around.

413
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,250
You just use whichever
one is sitting there?

414
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,292
I always find one.

415
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,002
Have you ever heard
of buying a toothbrush?

416
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,880
Of course,
I own my toothbrush.

417
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,429
I grew up poor. I had
little formal education, no real skills.

418
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,764
I don't work
especially hard

419
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:09,435
and most of my ideas are
either unoriginal or total crap.

420
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,604
And yet,
I walked right into a job

421
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,482
for which I was
ill-prepared, ill-suited,

422
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:19,111
and somebody else
already had, and I got it.

423
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,323
If you ask me, that's the
American dream right there.

424
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,243
Anything can happen
to anyone.

425
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,037
It's just random.
