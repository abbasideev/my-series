1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:03,253
Today is the first day
of Sabre's new project

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,505
to develop a chain
of retail stores.

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:09,384
I am meeting my new boss, Nellie
Bertram, Head of Special Projects.

4
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,636
Work starts at 9:00.

5
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:15,348
Sabre HQ is 30 minutes away
driving the speed limit,

6
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,684
giving everyone 20
minutes to shower,

7
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,061
plus 50 for Jim
to style his hair,

8
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:24,399
20 for breakfast, 40 for Erin to get
lost between her room and the lobby,

9
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:27,110
90 for Ryan to do
his morning ecstasy.

10
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,113
We're already 20 minutes late.

11
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,955
Wake up!

12
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,836
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, wake up! Ow!

13
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,464
Why are you sleeping
that way?

14
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,842
Oh. I was reading the
mattress tag and I fell asleep.

15
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,388
Stanley! Wake up! You've got
to wake up! The hotel's on fire!

16
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,974
Stanley, wake up!
It's pretzel day!

17
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,193
Good morning.

18
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:12,155
Hey, wake up. Let's have
some fun. We're in Florida now.

19
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,616
Hey, you. I'm so
glad this is happening.

20
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,118
I actually came to your
door twice last night.

21
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,329
Come on in,
the water's fine.

22
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,039
Oh, not cool!

23
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:26,086
I am on the two-kids sleep
schedule, so I'm up and at 'em at 4:15.

24
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:29,798
But no kids, so I honestly didn't
know what to do with myself.

25
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,300
And then I thought
of something. Uh...

26
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,263
Here is Dwight...
What the...

27
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,016
Oh, man.

28
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,476
What do you think happened?

29
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,813
Looks like Jim got mixed up
with some bad apples.

30
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,566
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It wasn't me.

31
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,529
I got to find "Luwanda
at the Alcohol Club."

32
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,681
Puppet.
Cool. For your kids?

33
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,517
Yeah. It's weird being away from
them. I've never done this before.

34
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,688
Attention, Dunder Mifflin
group, proceed outside.

35
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,858
The vehicle is waiting.
Seats have been assigned.

36
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,484
Shotgun goes to Ryan.

37
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,611
Congratulations, Ryan.

38
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,199
I need to make Nellie
see me as a leader today.

39
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,744
First impressions
get locked in forever.

40
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,912
When I first met Pam,
she said something

41
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,831
that slightly
rubbed me the wrong way.

42
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,125
Since then I've
loved working with Pam,

43
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,877
and she's frankly wonderful,

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,170
but I hate her.

45
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,589
I'll have
a bottle of the antacid.

46
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,841
Also I want to get
a souvenir for my son,

47
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,551
but his mother doesn't
acknowledge my paternity.

48
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,802
Do you have anything for that?

49
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,763
Also I want it to
have a Florida feel.

50
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,389
What does he like?

51
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,141
Power.

52
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,979
Okay, and this one is, "Huh. Don't
see too many museums around here."

53
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,398
Okay, Twiggy, that's enough.
Get in the car.

54
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,025
Hey, are you okay?

55
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,444
I'm fine, okay?
I'm just stressed

56
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,696
because I care
about this project.

57
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,198
And frankly,
the fact that none of you

58
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,741
are vomiting or
diarrheal right now,

59
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,909
I find very alarming.

60
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,036
Who says none of
us are diarrheal?

61
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,832
Are you sure it's stress?
Because I did poison you.

62
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,292
Very funny, Jim.

63
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,086
Oh, no, I'm serious.
I was thinking for this trip,

64
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,004
I have to do something epic,
so what should that be?

65
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,006
And then I thought of it.
I'll poison you.

66
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,258
What are you going to do? Are
you going to steal my newspaper,

67
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,760
or put a cricket in my cereal,
or something?

68
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,429
I'm gonna set your face
on fire. That's a good one.

69
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,684
Whoa. Stanley,
did you just come back

70
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:47,977
from burning down
a rival night club?

71
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,104
Laugh it up, Halpert.

72
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:53,024
I'm in Florida for a month without
my family, I'm going to enjoy this.

73
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,152
Want to get in?
You can work the iPod.

74
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,154
Yes.

75
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,991
You're a nice guy, Jim, but you
have no idea how to vacation.

76
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,159
Find some Kenny Loggins.

77
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,369
Loggins and Messina.

78
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,246
Did I say Messina?

79
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,211
Sorry, I
couldn't resist. It's so quiet.

80
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,754
I like it.

81
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,549
It's so peaceful, I've already
written 12 plays today.

82
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:22,846
It's so quiet, one might say
you could hear a pin...

83
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,016
I thought that
would be cooler.

84
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,435
I loved it.

85
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,853
Hey, can you pick
the pin? PR

86
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,438
Some of us like to
work in our bare feet.

87
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:36,359
Of course. I will pick
up the pin. It is right here.

88
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,113
Got it. Can we see that?
Did you really find it?

89
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,366
Yes. Right here.
Got it. Dink. Ow.

90
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,871
In the trash.
Hey, why is it so quiet?

91
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,706
Shouldn't
the phone be ringing?

92
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,791
Uh-oh.

93
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,877
Erin set
the phone to voicemail.

94
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,670
Great.
Oh, my God, we're screwed.

95
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,465
There.

96
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,758
Oh, there we go. Pam?

97
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,177
Yeah.

98
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,636
Can you get the phone?

99
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,054
Well, I'm not
the receptionist.

100
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,473
Well, you used to be.

101
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,810
I know, but I can't cover
reception. I have a ton of work to do.

102
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,729
Phone's ringing.

103
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,734
Will one of you get the phone? I
am freaking out! I know it's for me.

104
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,825
Are you guys kidding me? Stop
flirting and someone get the phone!

105
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,202
Answer the phone!

106
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,536
Pick up the phone!

107
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,871
Andy, you're standing up!

108
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,080
You're the closest one to it.

109
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,290
Fine.

110
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,626
Hello. Dunder Mifflin.

111
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,253
Hello, you've reached Dunder
Mifflin. How may I be of service?

112
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,632
How was the drive?
Fantastic.

113
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,841
Stanley drives so fast.

114
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:46,012
Life is short. Drive fast, leave a
sexy corpse. That's one of my mottos.

115
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,349
I would love to
hear the other mottos.

116
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,643
Quick query, Halpert.

117
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,810
No way.

118
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,187
Still queer?

119
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,939
Packer.

120
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,775
You can't put me down.
Too strong.

121
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,279
Yeah, Dwight and Jim
tried to get me fired.

122
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,823
But I landed on my
feet down here in Florida.

123
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,118
You see, this cat's got
nine lives and a nine-inch...

124
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,623
Say, "So who's
leading this thing anyway?"

125
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,834
So who's leading
this thing anyway?

126
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,090
Psst. Say,
"I can't wait to meet him."

127
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,259
I can't wait to meet him.

128
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:29,722
"Him," you said? Don't think
a woman can be a leader?

129
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,394
You poor, simple boy.

130
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,020
Expected a man, did you?

131
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:42,026
Strong, powerful, huge whopping
penis? Well, sorry to disappoint.

132
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,614
But my huge whopping penis is
right here, and I'm not afraid to use it.

133
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:52,120
So stop looking at my breasts,
and start looking at my penis.

134
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,252
I'm Nellie Bertram,
President of Special Projects.

135
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,045
In the next few weeks
we're going to throw

136
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,630
everything you
know about business

137
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,216
out of the window
and do it our own way.

138
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,635
Are your minds blown?

139
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:11,139
So, how did this special
project come about anyway?

140
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:17,520
Well, I interviewed to be
the manager of your branch.

141
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,941
After you decided I
wasn't a good fit...

142
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,526
It was...
Ah. Mmm-mmm.

143
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,529
It was. I went
on a shopping spree.

144
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,115
Very destructive,
I bought 13 pianos.

145
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,827
Then I realized, what if
Sabre had a store? Hmm?

146
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,415
So I called Jo, old friend,
founder of Sabre, and I told her,

147
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,460
and she grabbed me by the
shoulders and she said, "Yes!"

148
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,920
So let's talk about
this Sabre store then.

149
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,965
Probably going to
look stupid, right?

150
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,635
Like a big turd with a door
on the front, right?

151
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,219
What do you think
it should look like?

152
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,306
It might be fun if each
store had a different theme,

153
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,767
like a beach one,
a winter one, a jungle one.

154
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,685
No. Not a big fan of
the winter aesthetic.

155
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,604
Well, that was just one idea.
It doesn't have to be winter.

156
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,564
Oh, no, it does. It does.

157
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,233
It has to be winter,
and I reject it.

158
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:09,572
So I drew up a design concept,
probably going to be rubbish, right?

159
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,159
Would you like to look at it?
Just so you can laugh at it.

160
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,285
Yeah.

161
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,495
Let me just get
the projector working.

162
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,624
You got to stop with the
antacids. It's not the antidote.

163
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,876
You didn't poison me.
It's just stress.

164
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,252
Okay.

165
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,629
What is the antidote?

166
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,005
True love's kiss.

167
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,465
Jim, help me
lower this screen.

168
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,509
You're a big tall man.

169
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,679
You'd be hilarious trying
to do it, like a little boy.

170
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,639
Just let go of his balloon.

171
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,016
I'll do it.

172
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,520
I always say if you want
something done right, ask Dwight.

173
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,604
Right, Dwight.

174
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,107
Right, Dwight.
Right, Dwight. Right, Dwight.

175
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,693
Sorry. Now you'll never be
able to get that out of your head.

176
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,239
I can do it.

177
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,870
There we go.

178
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,003
Yes, a complete inability
to pass gas, pervert.

179
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:10,425
Yeah, it's tender, but it can't be
appendicitis. I eat more than enough bacon.

180
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,303
Okay, what poison mimics
the symptoms of appendicitis?

181
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,638
You don't know. Hold on.

182
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,188
What kind of
poison did you use?

183
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,775
Dwight, I didn't poison you.
I was kidding.

184
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,406
Yeah, I'm going to
need an ambulance.

185
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,826
Hold on. I have the address
in my phone. Hold on.

186
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,454
Sabre has
assigned... Hold on one second.

187
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,080
...the following positions
in the retail division.

188
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,331
Uh, quick question.

189
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,877
Vice President, who is that?
There is no name listed.

190
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,839
Is there not? Maybe I'm just
waiting for someone to wow me.

191
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,970
Sir? Sir, where should
we send the ambulance?

192
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,723
Send it to
the freaking moon, idiot.

193
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,935
I'll tell you what, though,
since my move down to Florida,

194
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,188
I've really gotten back
into hunting, big-time.

195
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:09,233
Hunting's so primal,
almost sexual. - Totally.

196
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,943
Yeah, I mean,
I'd never bang an animal.

197
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,069
You can hardly
tell the difference

198
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,279
between a boy or a girl,
you know?

199
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,781
But hunting's intense.

200
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,282
You talking about hunting?

201
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,909
I love hunting.
I'm a master hunter.

202
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,994
Did you say "masturbator"?

203
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,747
I'm a decent baiter. My cousin,
Mose, that's a master baiter.

204
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,874
Why are you
sitting down like that?

205
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,001
Why is everyone
else standing up?

206
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,338
Okay, team, let's get
back to work! Break's over.

207
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,258
Wow. Are you that bored?

208
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,428
It's just rum.
I'm not bored. I'm a pirate.

209
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,180
Is that another motto?

210
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,848
It's whatever you want.

211
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,225
Hmm.

212
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,726
Or do you only
drink with your kids?

213
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,228
No, let's do it.

214
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,437
Woah. That's healthy.

215
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,940
I've spent so much of
my life telling myself,

216
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,234
"Please, don't
end up like Stanley."

217
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,405
And now I'm wondering
if I even have what it takes.

218
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:03,246
We have the Sabre pyramid,
right? We've got a bunch of humans.

219
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,415
You guys. Humans, pyramid.

220
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,918
Human pyramid. Do you follow?

221
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,754
It's a team-building exercise.

222
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,422
You love it. Who's in?

223
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,342
Tallahassee, let's go.

224
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,510
Jim, are you in?

225
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,928
Oh, I don't know.

226
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,388
Sounds like a hoot. I'm in.

227
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,266
All right.
What the heck? Let's do it.

228
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,685
This is great.
This is going to be great.

229
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,436
I feel like I'm
in ancient Egypt.

230
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,731
I'll be on top. That's the
most important position.

231
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,817
Dude, I think you have
appendicitis.

232
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,111
Dwight,
why don't we just hold off

233
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,113
with the human
pyramids for a while?

234
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,240
Everyone stop moving.
Everyone stop wiggling.

235
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,533
I feel like I'm
going to vomit.

236
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,743
Dude, don't you yak on me.
This shirt is Van Heusen.

237
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,911
Oh, stop moving.

238
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,956
No one's moving.

239
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,336
Arrest Jim.
He poisoned me.

240
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,214
What? No. No.
It was not a poisoning.

241
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,341
The one thing Pam
made sure I knew,

242
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,552
Florida's pretty loose
with the death penalty.

243
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,470
You need an operation.
You have appendicitis.

244
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,140
Oh! Who called it?
Nothing but net.

245
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,474
How long will he be gone?

246
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,851
Two or three days.

247
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,061
Don't remember me like this.

248
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,731
Remember me as the man
who pulled down the screen.

249
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,899
Drama queen, am I right?

250
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,654
Philip, if you're
hearing this memo,

251
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,240
that can only mean
one thing, I am dead.

252
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:26,245
You are the rightful heir to Schrute
Farms. Please, you must do one thing.

253
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,831
Kill Mose before he kills you.

254
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,837
Mose. Hey, it's Dwight.

255
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,505
Listen, yeah, I just want
to give you a heads up.

256
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,965
That was
an interesting diversion.

257
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,508
Should we get
back to the meeting?

258
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,386
Woah. Are those mini pizzas?

259
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,639
Yeah. I figure if
we keep things savory

260
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,891
while Oscar's mouth
is in canker country...

261
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,226
I also have some
bacon-wrapped dates on deck.

262
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,397
Look at these little mini pizzas.
Does this make me look huge?

263
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,610
Hey, guys,
look at me, I'm huge.

264
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,988
Hey, Darryl, good news,
your fax went through.

265
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,532
Oh yeah.

266
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,700
Up high.

267
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,952
Yes, sir. Thanks.

268
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,497
Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. I put
out some new magazines. Check it out.

269
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,082
Ah, Dwell.

270
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,880
I'm acting like I like
Reception, and I'm a really good actor

271
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,425
So people are actually buying
that I actually like Reception.

272
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,387
But I mean,
seriously, Reception sucks.

273
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,055
Ooh! There's the phone!

274
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,557
I just
got out of surgery.

275
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,935
What's going on? Fill me in.

276
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,230
Well, we broke into groups and the
groups are giving presentations later.

277
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,065
Who's doing the presentations?

278
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,733
Packer's giving one.

279
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,568
Jim will probably
give ours, I guess.

280
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:40,695
Damn it!

281
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,656
Let's see.
What else have you missed?

282
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,033
Ryan switched his
nametag to his pants,

283
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,576
so now it's like
if you wear yours

284
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,120
on your shirt,
you're a total dip.

285
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,288
But if you switch,
you're a copycat.

286
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,541
But I think I
figured out a solution.

287
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,420
What else? My shoes are...

288
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,256
...features the tech support
area. Bring in your product,

289
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,842
a bunch of nerdy
virgins fix it on the spot.

290
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,260
Huge for building loyalty.

291
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,095
Yes, that is
a very good point.

292
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,805
Yeah, Todd, decent idea.

293
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,891
Obvious, but interesting.

294
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,560
Dwight, are you all right?

295
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,145
I'm great. How are you?

296
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,775
Uh...

297
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,446
What's our presentation about?

298
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,655
Dwight, will you go
back to the hospital?

299
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,157
You were there for
like three hours.

300
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,783
I got the surgery.
What else is there to do?

301
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,785
Do 100 jumping jacks.
No. I don't feel like it.

302
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,078
You do 100 jumping jacks.

303
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,329
I don't feel like it either.

304
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,957
...ninety-seven, 98, 99...

305
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,709
I want the Vice Presidency.

306
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,085
You haven't done
any of the research.

307
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,880
You're too slow. You're too
small. Seabiscuit is a stupid name.

308
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,631
You guys sound just like
the enemies of Seabiscuit.

309
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,175
I'm going to do it.

310
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,760
Oh, let him do it.

311
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,970
Stanley,
are you listening to music?

312
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,221
Yep.

313
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,059
All right, who's ready
for the next presentation?

314
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,311
Oh... What is your topic?

315
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,231
What is our topic? Oh,
what a topic it is. Mmm-hmm.

316
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,816
Retail consumer habits.

317
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,860
Really? Okay.

318
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,613
Retail consumer habits is...

319
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,366
The only thing
you need to know

320
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,743
about retail
consumer habits is that

321
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,245
consumers are
mindless lemmings.

322
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,831
They just want to
be told what to do.

323
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,379
Fast-forward to today, and the
retail consumer is independent,

324
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:26,801
well-informed, super smart.
Super smart.

325
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,511
Okay.

326
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,600
Shopping habits are both
seasonal and cyclical.

327
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,810
What does this mean?

328
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:36,977
I can field this one.

329
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,187
No, sit down.

330
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,983
Seasonal, well, the Christmas
shopping season is certainly a busy one.

331
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,777
Back to school is as well,

332
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,113
and in early summer
it seems to slow down a bit.

333
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,948
But shopping is also cyclical.

334
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:53,285
The menstrual cycle determines
every choice a woman makes.

335
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:58,707
You see, during ovulation, a
woman's only goal is to get pregnant.

336
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,378
During menses, she is
sad that she has failed.

337
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,297
And how does
the woman console herself?

338
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,758
Shopping. Shopping.

339
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,719
Just, Jim, could you fetch me
some ice chips?

340
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,977
Thank you. Just gonna take
a brief pause at this point.

341
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,562
Thank you.

342
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,481
Oh, God.

343
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,735
Next slide.

344
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,823
Mail call!

345
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,951
His name is Oscar,
and he's got some mail

346
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,997
And he better open it or go
to jail, 'cause it's your taxes

347
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,167
His name is Kevin,
and no mail for him

348
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,503
But he got a coupon
for some frozen yogurt

349
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,506
Are those the lyrics?

350
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,425
"Anderson's Three Pillars
of Retail."

351
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,760
Crucial. So important.

352
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,222
Next.

353
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,808
Are there any questions?

354
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,478
What are the Three
Pillars of Retail?

355
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,774
Convenience.
Ingredients.

356
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,860
Service.
Burgers.

357
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,028
Building loyalty.

358
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,196
Killing royalty.

359
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,489
But truth be told,
we should really

360
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,283
disregard
Anderson's Three Pillars.

361
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,244
He was later
diagnosed with dementia.

362
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,122
You know what is important?

363
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:24,627
Is Dwight's pillars,
and there's only one, desire.

364
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,589
Do we have a desire
to dominate the retail space?

365
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,716
Not just succeed in it,
but to dominate.

366
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,135
And looking around this room,
I'm not so sure that we do.

367
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,220
But we can get there.

368
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,432
And I can lead us there,
and that is all that matters.

369
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,143
Very true. Where there's
a will, there's a way.

370
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,938
I once spent
a passionate night

371
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,732
with Hugh Grant's brother,
John Grant.

372
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:50,152
He's older than Hugh,
just a little bit uglier.

373
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,528
How did I pull that off?

374
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,114
Sheer force of will.

375
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,491
That is very good, Dwight.

376
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,868
Thank you very much.
Any other questions?

377
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,912
Jim.

378
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,538
You are bleeding
through your shirt.

379
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:03,958
Oops.

380
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,837
That's embarrassing.
Egg on my face.

381
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:11,674
Ah...

382
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,469
Hey, having fun?

383
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,596
Yes, I am,
as a matter of fact.

384
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,516
Oh, I know how it is.
I know it's a lot of fun.

385
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,685
I don't know how it is.
Andy, this is a lame job.

386
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,144
What are you doing here?

387
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,355
I found my calling.

388
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:31,860
Andy, when I was 12 years old,
we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo.

389
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:37,574
I met this girl. I thought she was
so perfect. I was in love with her.

390
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,036
But when the sun came up,
I knew it wasn't real

391
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,248
because she was ugly
and I had grown tired of her.

392
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,709
I know you want
Reception today,

393
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,419
but tomorrow you
won't want to do her.

394
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,004
She's a dog.

395
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,840
Guys, I don't
like this analogy.

396
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,510
Oh, fine.

397
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,684
Did you see this?

398
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,768
It's nice.

399
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:05,936
I mean...

400
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,441
How are you feeling?

401
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,817
Amazing.

402
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,402
Just lost four
ounces of appendix,

403
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,070
already replaced
it with muscle.

404
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,281
Can I see the wound?

405
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,956
Oh, that's disgusting.
That's barely healed.

406
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,001
You're not paying me to heal.
You're paying me to kick ass.

407
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:33,756
A few hours ago, your
body was open like a cabinet.

408
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,133
That's right.
That is amazing.

409
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,468
Todd, look at that.

410
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,844
Oh, yikes!

411
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,054
Incoming.

412
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,263
Not so fast.

413
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,931
Would you come
in early tomorrow,

414
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,100
so we could talk about
the store over breakfast?

415
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,228
I feel you have
a lot to offer.

416
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,605
It would be an honor, ma'am.

417
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,649
I'll go ahead and cancel
my post-op checkup right now.

418
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,443
I had two goals today,

419
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,905
the first was to make myself the
clear candidate for Vice President.

420
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,657
I achieved that,
no thanks to my appendix.

421
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,619
The second was to find a
memorable souvenir for Philip.

422
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,955
For that, I do have
to thank my appendix.

423
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,885
Dunder Mifflin, how can I
help you save money on paper?

424
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,637
This is Andrew.

425
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,389
Hi, Andrew.
What happened to Erin?

426
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,183
Oh, she's on an assignment
in Florida for a couple weeks.

427
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,394
Oh, good for her.
She's such a sweetheart.

428
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,687
You tell her Donna
Moraski misses her.

429
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,065
I miss her, too.

430
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,736
Everyone, we have
a very special guest.

431
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,241
He turned an idea into a
store, into hundreds of stores.

432
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:46,412
I give you Wally Amos, founder
of Famous Amos cookies.

433
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,579
Yeah!

434
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,335
So I hear
you're all looking to

435
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,337
bake up some dough
in the sales game.

436
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,424
Well, back when I
was regular Amos...

437
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,633
What's under the cloth?

438
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,176
We'll get to that.

439
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,761
Cookies. I bet you
anything it's cookies.

440
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,513
It's cookies.

441
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,974
Let me finish my speech first.

442
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:10,644
Oh, we get the gist. It's just
success and effort, isn't it?

443
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,564
So just don't be coy.
Make with the cookies.

444
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,023
Cookies.

445
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,525
Cookies.

446
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,445
Famous, hi.

447
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,156
I'm sure you get ideas
for new cookies all the time.

448
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,451
But I...
Is it oatmeal with no raisins?

449
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,660
I'm sorry to have
wasted your time.

450
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,870
That's okay.
Thank you very much.
