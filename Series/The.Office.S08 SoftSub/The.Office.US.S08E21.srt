1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:05,380
Phew! Wow. It is raining
cats and dogs out there.

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,215
Holy moly!

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,552
<i>Phyllis says the same 12
cliches every time it rains.</i>

4
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:14,556
So, I promised everyone that if
she says them all by noon today,

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,100
I will send out
for hot chocolates.

6
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:18,602
So how was the drive in?

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,520
Nobody knows how to
drive in the rain.

8
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:21,938
You don't say?
Yeah.

9
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:25,442
You know the roads are actually
the slickest in the first half hour?

10
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:29,988
I think it's the oil, it comes to
the surface. - I agree.

11
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:34,534
Ooh! The plants are
gonna love this. Yeah.

12
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,042
I actually sleep
better when it's raining.

13
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,293
Tell me about it.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,379
Time's almost up How
many are left? Just one.

15
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,466
"This weather makes me want to stay
at home, curled up with a good book."

16
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,096
Phyllis, this rain, does it make
you want to be doing something?

17
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,765
What do you mean?

18
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:00,352
You know, like, aren't some things
just so nice and cozy in the rain?

19
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,021
Hey, come on. Lots of
things are cozy in the rain.

20
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,733
And that's noon.
Exactly!

21
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,569
Sorry about that,
everybody.

22
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,948
Hey, Phyllis, would
you like a hot chocolate?

23
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,074
Ooh, I'd love one.

24
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,660
I'm going out to get
two hot chocolates.

25
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,208
I mean, normally the rain would
make me want to stay at home,

26
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,626
curled up with
a good book,

27
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,212
but everybody's being
so nice to me today.

28
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,838
I'm really happy
being here.

29
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,950
My girlfriend's back and
there's going to be trouble

30
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,743
Hey, la, hey, la,
his girlfriend's back

31
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,787
Hey, la, hey, la,
my girlfriend's back

32
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,999
A month ago, I walked
out of this office

33
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,834
positive I was
never coming back.

34
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,795
I probably shouldn't
have emailed everyone

35
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,964
telling them exactly
what I thought of them.

36
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,091
Hey, Erin, thank you
for the nice email.

37
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,095
Yeah. I don't get emotional
a lot, but that was...

38
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,848
I'm just glad to know
I had an impact.

39
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,891
I meant every word.

40
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,521
In other news, Erin and
Andy are back together.

41
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,149
Crazy story.
Yes.

42
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,152
I drove all the way down to
Florida, she was not expecting it,

43
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,070
totally swept her off
her feet. Right? Yeah.

44
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,238
How long
was the drive?

45
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,990
It's like a day and
a half each way.

46
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:40,452
But when I got there, I went right
up to the house, and I was like...

47
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,496
Day and a half? My
lumbar would be killing me.

48
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,375
You should get this lumbar
support cushion thing my dad has.

49
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,752
What's it called? Um...

50
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,129
Not Easy-Rest.

51
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,340
That gas must've cost
a pretty penny, huh?

52
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,632
Well,
he's got a Prius.

53
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,051
How many times you
fill the tank? Three, four?

54
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,178
What does gas
cost down there?

55
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,347
Lumbar Buddy!
Lumbar Buddy.

56
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,556
Oh, yeah,
Lumbar Buddy.

57
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,475
Tell you what,
I'll email you the story.

58
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,143
It's a real
tearjerker, though.

59
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,770
So read with caution.

60
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,355
Anyway, I know it's
the end of the day.

61
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,814
We just wanted to
stop by and say hi.

62
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,400
And then later on, we have
a reservation at Patsel's.

63
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,778
Miss Lumbar!

64
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,238
Hey, Kev.
Yeah.

65
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,949
Nice sweater.
Thank you!

66
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,119
Nellie was nice enough
to give it to me.

67
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,706
She's sweet. I just
wish there was pockets.

68
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,210
What happened
to Old Salty?

69
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,795
Nellie let me
bobble-ize him.

70
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,089
His name is now
Captain Mutato.

71
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,925
I've written quite a bit
of X-Men fan fiction.

72
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,761
Captain Mutato is
half-man, half-mermaid.

73
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,930
So he can fight
crime as a man

74
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,640
and make love
as a mermaid.

75
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,268
Most of my writing
involves the latter.

76
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:53,983
Okey-doke.

77
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,987
Yes?

78
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,241
Whoa!

79
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,871
Well, you must be the famous Nellie
Bertram I've been hearing all about.

80
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:10,542
I am the famous Andy Bernard
you have been hearing all about.

81
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,419
Oh, yes. I just
want to thank you

82
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,422
for jumping in and
minding the store

83
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,881
during my temporary absence.

84
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,259
You are most welcome.

85
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,679
Anyway, now that I'm back, I
would love to have my office back,

86
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,806
whenever you get a chance. No.

87
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,936
Obviously we'll figure
out the logistics

88
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,439
of moving all of this
stuff out of here.

89
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,568
But, you know, the sooner
the better. Get back to normalcy.

90
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:37,944
Mmm. No.

91
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,241
Thank you.

92
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,535
Okay.

93
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,703
Wait. Uh...

94
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,956
When I showed up here,
there was no manager.

95
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,083
It's like when the Americans
showed up at the Moon.

96
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,460
Nobody was there.

97
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,044
So they planted
their flag,

98
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,754
and it's their
moon now, isn't it?

99
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,925
Nobody likes it, but it's
America's bloody moon.

100
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,345
Just lay him in his crib
and then bicycle his legs.

101
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,680
And then after
Jim quiets down,

102
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,140
you do the same thing
with your baby.

103
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,935
But if he keeps having
problems, just give me a call.

104
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,479
Oh, my gosh,
thank you so much.

105
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,771
But seriously, we don't
want to bother you

106
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,064
any more than we
already have. That's it.

107
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,941
It's no bother.
You guys are our friends.

108
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,068
Ravi, our amazing
pediatrician,

109
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,321
was asking us if
we knew any girls,

110
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,948
and I said, "I know
the perfect girl."

111
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:28,953
Yeah. Because Kelly is
Indian and... Oh, that's it!

112
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,582
Race had nothing
to do with it.

113
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,459
I just knew they'd
be good together.

114
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,960
Why?

115
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,338
Kelly has been
a handful in the past.

116
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,839
But she's had
a bad influence.

117
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,926
She's like an addict, and
I just had to get her clean.

118
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:44,844
Get lower.

119
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,430
Next, I'm going to set up
my sister with Darryl.

120
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,890
Okay, we get it.

121
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,518
What? I think they'd be
good together. Really?

122
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,690
Um, also, little tip,
never shake the baby.

123
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,277
Sorry, just to be clear, you're
saying do not shake the baby?

124
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,445
Don't shake the baby.

125
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,864
A lot of times parents get
frustrated because the baby's crying,

126
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:08,910
and they shake the baby,
and you got to...

127
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:09,994
You can't do that.

128
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,788
Don't shake our baby.
Yeah.

129
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,498
Okay, I'd never
heard that before.

130
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,582
Oh, my God.
So, thank you.

131
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,668
Yeah, I'm glad you
said something. Me, too.

132
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,879
Kelly and I broke up, and she
can do whatever she wants.

133
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,090
And her new boyfriend
seems awesome,

134
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,008
if you're into
Indian people.

135
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,635
I'm not.

136
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,055
And that's
when I realized,

137
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,015
if you're gonna put a
thermometer in one end,

138
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,309
you'd better put a
lollipop in the other.

139
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,563
Hey, I'm sorry. Is this a
workplace or a Starbucks?

140
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,315
Because I was under the
impression it was a workplace.

141
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,733
Maybe I'm
the crazy one.

142
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,986
No. No, we're sorry.
Come on, let's go, Ravi.

143
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,989
Also, since when do we have
guests here without clearance?

144
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,490
I didn't okay this.

145
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,326
Hey, um...

146
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,454
What's the deal with this guy?
He's really into Kelly, huh?

147
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,665
Yeah, they're
really great together.

148
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,250
Makes me wonder
if I made a mistake.

149
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,545
No, no, no. Come on. I think you
guys are both happier now, right?

150
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,047
You're single. Plenty
of girls to date, right?

151
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,341
Yeah.

152
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,595
Maybe we weren't right
together, but it's weird,

153
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,265
I'd rather she be alone
than with somebody.

154
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,183
Is that love?

155
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,896
That's about it, yeah.

156
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,318
Well, Nellie picked up
the slack around here

157
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,279
while you were trolling
the Florida beaches for tail

158
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,364
like some college student
on spring break.

159
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,826
I had to tell Erin
how I felt.

160
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,870
Andy, I appreciate
your romantic quest,

161
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,706
and in an age before
the telephone or Internet,

162
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,083
or written language,
that would be compelling.

163
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,628
But there are five, six
devices in this room alone

164
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,380
that would have let you tell her
that without ever going to Florida.

165
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,258
We live in
amazing times.

166
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,427
Yeah, I know
I screwed up.

167
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,139
But I always do
whatever you ask of me,

168
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,516
and this will never
happen again.

169
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,895
And if Erin decides she's made
a mistake and returns to Florida?

170
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,566
At least she knows how I
feel, and I would not follow her.

171
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,365
What if she were kidnapped by a
gang of Albanian human traffickers?

172
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,451
Like in Taken?

173
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,702
What?

174
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,954
Yes, of course,
if she's taken.

175
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,165
That's what I'm talking
about. By Albanians.

176
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,334
I would stay
in this office.

177
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:25,088
Wow, okay. I'll
remember you said that.

178
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,845
Nellie,

179
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:38,601
you've been terrific
in your interim capacity,

180
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,062
but Andrew is
the rightful manager,

181
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,940
so if you would just
give him his office.

182
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,983
I'm sorry?

183
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,946
This is what I was
trying to tell you.

184
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,449
I'm not accustomed to
people saying no to me.

185
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,494
Well, Bobby,
get accustomed to it,

186
00:08:56,577 --> 00:09:01,958
because then it feels so good
when they finally say yes.

187
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,676
You're both adults.
I'm sure you can

188
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,431
figure this out
between yourselves.

189
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,730
I never allow sexual desire to
influence a business decision.

190
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:28,192
So, I find it best to
recuse myself temporarily

191
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,902
until I've had
a chance to make love,

192
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:34,741
and then go back and
analyze the situation rationally.

193
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,537
Buffett operates
the same way.

194
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,083
I want to order the
zebra rug for my office,

195
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,169
but can you dye it
entirely black?

196
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,881
No, I still want it
to be a zebra.

197
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,508
Well, I'll know.

198
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,845
Because they're
ridiculous creatures.

199
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,430
They don't know
what they are.

200
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,932
Phyllis says ♪. Duffy's
might be more our speed.

201
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,852
And if we want even the option
of drawing on the placemats...

202
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,315
I got a little bit
of an anger problem.

203
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,901
Got me in some trouble
a couple years ago.

204
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,694
When I see him
start to get mad,

205
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,323
I just put my hand
on his arm like this.

206
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,827
It reminds me to just
check out and relax.

207
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,874
There's also a lullaby they used to
sing to me when I was growing up.

208
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:30,338
The state of Pennsylvania
is watching over you

209
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,759
No need for parents,
the governor will do

210
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,302
It's really nice.

211
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,974
The General Assembly's
like a mom and a dad

212
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,438
...had

213
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,360
I got a call
about a trespasser.

214
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,112
Yes. Right this way.

215
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,994
Because they are
idiots. Big, stripy, horsey idiots.

216
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,288
What you don't... Hey!

217
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,833
Hank, please remove
Nellie from my office.

218
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,167
Hank, thank God
you're here.

219
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,586
This psychopath keeps
barging into my office.

220
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,588
It's my office.

221
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,676
Well, she's sitting
there like a manager.

222
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,512
And you're standing
up here like me.

223
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,766
But maybe it's a little
more complicated than that.

224
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,899
I'm going to
count down from five,

225
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,026
and if you're not
out of my office,

226
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,821
I'm going to
dock your pay $100.

227
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,282
Five, four...

228
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,741
You can't dock my pay.

229
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,535
I am your boss.

230
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,537
Three, two, one.

231
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,831
Congratulations,
you just lost $100.

232
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,165
Really?

233
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:53,421
Angela,
dock Andy's pay $100!

234
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:54,922
On it!

235
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,635
Great! Five, four,
three, two, one.

236
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:04,807
Angela, please dock
Nellie's pay $100.

237
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,353
Hmm?

238
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,606
Is she responding? Hmm...

239
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,650
Angela? Do you want to go again?

240
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,652
Angela!
Let's go again.

241
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,488
Five, four, three,
two, one.

242
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,700
Oh, she's counting again.
Look out.

243
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:26,120
- Angela, $200!
- Got it!

244
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,331
Seriously, Angela?

245
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:33,628
I know what,
let's go $10,000.

246
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,505
Five, four... You're
just saying numbers.

247
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,382
It's meaningless.
Three...

248
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:42,929
It's literally like...
Two, one...

249
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,519
I have to pee.

250
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,029
There you go.

251
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,699
Hey, we're going to
have a nice hot date.

252
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,246
What are you guys
talking about?

253
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,248
Charlie Rose.
I don't know who that is.

254
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,333
Guys.
He has...

255
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,960
Guys, come here.

256
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,214
What are you...
Come on!

257
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,677
Where are we going?

258
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,388
Okay. Do you guys want...

259
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,390
Andy, you should
not stand there.

260
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,059
The warehouse guys
pee there all the time.

261
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,436
Ew.

262
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,108
Okay. Do you guys want to
be part of something huge?

263
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,151
I'm already a member of
the largest club there is.

264
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,611
Non-churchgoing
Christians.

265
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,907
You remember in
the movie Rudy,

266
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,868
when the player comes
into the coach's office

267
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,870
and he throws his
jersey down, and he's like,

268
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,414
“I'm not playing
without Rudy."

269
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,874
And the coach is like,
"One guy. No big deal."

270
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,585
But then every player
comes in, one by one,

271
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,964
and they all throw their jerseys
down for Rudy. Remember that?

272
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,091
Yeah, I remember that.

273
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,719
So, how amazing
would it be

274
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,847
if you guys all
did that for me

275
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,517
with your own brand new
Dunder Mifflin jerseys?

276
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,477
Hey, guys.

277
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,070
Gross. Gross, gross.

278
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,447
You don't need to go.

279
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,574
I found these the other day
while I was journaling,

280
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,159
and they reminded
me of you.

281
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,995
Those are from our
weekend at the time-share.

282
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,955
Yeah, the fractional
ownership property.

283
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,459
We took this one right before
we got in that huge fight.

284
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,961
God, I don't even remember
what that fight was about.

285
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,046
You were being
really bratty about

286
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,213
where we would
go out to dinner,

287
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:45,676
but all I remember is how pretty
you looked taking those pictures of me.

288
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,513
Anyway, if you want to
order prints of your own,

289
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,057
I can send you the link.

290
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,850
Yeah, that'd
be cool. Thanks.

291
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,018
I'd like that.

292
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,063
You were so annoyed
that I was taking that picture.

293
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,023
Someone's into my abs.

294
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,653
Sorry.

295
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,616
You have doubles of this one,
I could probably just take one.

296
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,909
I really want both.

297
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,662
I am seeing a side of Ryan
that I have never seen

298
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,414
since the last time
we were broken up.

299
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,167
I am in love
with Kelly Kapoor.

300
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,253
And I don't know how I'm going
to feel tomorrow or the next day

301
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:26,050
or the day after that, but I do
know that right here, right now,

302
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:30,012
all I can think about is spending
the rest of my life with her.

303
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,516
Again, that could change.

304
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,188
Hey. So, last night
was so not a big deal.

305
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,815
Oh, yeah,
I was just tired.

306
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,066
We both were.
Yeah.

307
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,902
Plus I was definitely
not my normal sexy self.

308
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,906
No. Are you kidding?
You were so sexy.

309
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,535
Just the thought of you last
night, like, crazy turns me on.

310
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,039
It just didn't last night.
But you were so dang doable.

311
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,457
Even though we didn't do it.

312
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:02,253
Well, it's not like we can't do it
again when... Whenever you're ready.

313
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,715
Uh, yeah. We are sexing it up
tonight. I don't care what you say.

314
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,552
No. It will be consensual.

315
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,720
Whether you like it or not.

316
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,015
Sounds good.
I'm gonna do you.

317
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,642
Not if I do you first.
Oh.

318
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,564
But really,
it's not a big deal.

319
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:29,530
Yeah. I know
it's not a big deal.

320
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,704
Oh, hey, instead of lunch, do
you feel like going shopping?

321
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,748
Are you serious? Yes.

322
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,377
That would be... I can't...
Can you believe this?

323
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,212
Hey, can you believe it? Nope.

324
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:47,923
Hmm.

325
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,218
Oh, do you want that dress
in every size and every color?

326
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,678
Yeah, it's free returns.

327
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,140
I saw you were getting
along with Ryan again.

328
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:00,269
He's so sweet. He pointed
to my latte and he said,

329
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,771
"Kelly, that would be
the color of our children."

330
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,816
God. Yeah, he's so great.

331
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,446
Remember how it felt when
he cheated on you, though?

332
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,864
Which time?

333
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,787
I am not going to let Kelly
throw her life away on Ryan.

334
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:23,167
And it has nothing to do
with access to my pediatrician.

335
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,628
Why you would even ask,
or were going to ask.

336
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,088
Because I feel like
that question was coming.

337
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,549
But, you know, whatever.
Ask me anything.

338
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,760
Yes? When you lost
the manager job...

339
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:36,347
...did it affect you
outside of the office?

340
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,640
How?

341
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,601
I don't know what
the technical term is.

342
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,731
Penial softy-osus.

343
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,986
Erin, I am so glad
that you trusted me.

344
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,989
You came to the exact
right person for this.

345
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,451
No, I have never once experienced
anything remotely like that.

346
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,662
Ever, ever. Never!

347
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,167
Okay?
Okay.

348
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,003
Washington Monument!
Okay.

349
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,299
Eiffel Tower!
Okay.

350
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,094
Colossus at Rhodes!

351
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,431
Hey! I hear you've been
badmouthing me to Kelly.

352
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,935
All I did was remind her that
you used to treat her badly.

353
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,438
Well, that's your opinion and it's
her opinion, but it's not my opinion.

354
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,900
If you have something bad to
say to me, Pam, say it to my face.

355
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,819
Fair enough. Um...

356
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,657
I don't think you're
a very good person.

357
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,994
And forgive me, but I feel
like I've said this to you before.

358
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,161
I don't like you very much.

359
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:45,124
Well, a lot of people would say that
I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.

360
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,378
Come on, Ryan, really?
Ravi's way better.

361
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,006
For Kelly?
Yeah.

362
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,968
Man, you're insane right now.
Ravi's the whole package.

363
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,304
I've never met Ravi,
personally,

364
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,930
but I'm going to
go ahead and say

365
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,683
just having known you
a short while, Brian,

366
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:07,062
that I prefer Ravi, and again,
I've never even met the guy.

367
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,190
Kelly, look around.
Nobody believes in us.

368
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,567
Nobody.

369
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,737
Ryan, just stop making a scene
in front of all my friends.

370
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,073
Kelly, I wrote you the
most amazing love poem.

371
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:22,578
But I can't even read it.
My heart couldn't handle it.

372
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,747
Oh, come on... Oh, no,
no, no, read it, please.

373
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,457
I love amazing poetry.

374
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,500
No, it would cause
me too much pain.

375
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,877
Read through
the pain. Be strong.

376
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,837
This poem would
crush you.

377
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,007
God, Ryan, go away! She
found herself a beautiful boyfriend.

378
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,968
Yeah, man, he's
absolutely gorgeous.

379
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,345
Please leave her alone.

380
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,306
You see, Kelly?
Our love scares them.

381
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,100
It screws up their
cookie cutter world!

382
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,649
Do you guys think
he's right, though?

383
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,862
Do we live in a
cookie cutter's world?

384
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,698
Absolutely, but it's
not the point. God.

385
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,787
One of Toby's eyes is
getting smaller. So there's that.

386
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:09,166
Gabe bragged about having an
extra ticket to the air show this weekend

387
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,878
and Meredith said she was interested,
and then Gabe said immediately

388
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,255
that his friend might
be taking the ticket,

389
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,883
so I'll keep you
posted on that.

390
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,719
Every day, I brief Nellie on
what's going on in the office.

391
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:21,887
Most of it's irrelevant.

392
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,473
But a good informer doesn't
judge what's worth passing on.

393
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,642
Oh, and Andy lost
his masculinity,

394
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,893
so congratulations
on that.

395
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,228
What do you mean?

396
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,896
Erin made it clear to me
that he was unable

397
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,398
to perform sexually
last night.

398
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,525
By contrast, I went to sleep
with an erection so large

399
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,318
it was like I was
wearing no blanket at all.

400
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,489
I knew you'd win, but
you just demolished him!

401
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,741
I'm little bit
jealous, actually.

402
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,993
Reduced him to a mere ant!

403
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,747
I just wanted to take the
man's job, not his manhood.

404
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,458
Are we good?
Everybody got a jersey?

405
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,586
I still think it's weird
that we're just doing Rudy.

406
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,381
Like, not a spin on it,
we're just doing it.

407
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,175
What about The Dead Poets
Society? Much better movie.

408
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,011
What? Get your movie
rankings right, dude.

409
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,805
Why can't we just do
whatever movie we want?

410
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,181
"Cause I was gonna
do a Spartacus.

411
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,641
Oh, I wanna do
a Spartacus.

412
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:08,892
I am Spartacus!

413
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,436
No, I am Spartacus!

414
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:14,148
Hey, guys, we're doing
Rudy, okay? So get ready.

415
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,109
Okay, I would like to invite
everyone into the conference room.

416
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,278
Sure. But first,
there is something...

417
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,280
No, that's not important.
Conference room, now.

418
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,866
You can't
call a meeting, so...

419
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,952
But I would like
to have a meeting

420
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,203
in the conference
room right now,

421
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,831
SO come on, guys, let's
get in the conference room.

422
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,207
Thank you. Good!

423
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,376
Thank you for
coming to my meeting.

424
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,461
Appreciate it.

425
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,006
Okay, if you would like
to take a seat, we can get started.

426
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,383
Can't do it because I
got to run a meeting, so...

427
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,554
Wanted to talk to all of
you guys about importance

428
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:52,728
and know that each and every
one of you is vitally important.

429
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:57,149
Andrew, not everyone here is
important. And the word is "impotence."

430
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,736
Which is important
in its own way,

431
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,279
so if you'd just like
to take a seat, Andy.

432
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,990
Take a man's job,
but leave him his balls.

433
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,409
Margaret Thatcher
said that, probably.

434
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,912
Don't know. Don't read.
Didn't see the movie.

435
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,831
So, Nellie wanted to have
a meeting on impotence.

436
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,125
I told her she would have to
run it, as impotence is a concept

437
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,085
as foreign to me
as baba ghanoush.

438
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,672
Something to do
with eggplant.

439
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,008
That's all I know.

440
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:27,721
This meeting is not about
any one person in particular.

441
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,557
It is a human problem. It's
not just a human problem.

442
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,851
Flounders frequently
experience impotence,

443
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,645
especially when converting
from male to female

444
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,688
and then back again to
male. - Really?

445
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,484
Nellie, does the "person"
affected by this want us to help her

446
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,860
in any way in particular?

447
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:42,986
Oh! Oh!

448
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,738
It's not me. No, no!

449
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:47,199
I've never had any
problem in that arena.

450
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,910
And I have been
with several older men.

451
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,078
How old?
How old?

452
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,496
Jinx, buy me some Coke.

453
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,456
Dwight told me
about it earlier.

454
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,124
Dwight?

455
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,001
You promised.

456
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,836
Dwight couldn't
get it up for Nellie?

457
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,214
No, no, no, no, no,
it's not me.

458
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,883
I'm going to prove it
right here and now.

459
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,220
What are you doing?
Stop that, Dwight!

460
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,138
Stop that, stop it!

461
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:15,310
Fine, it was me. I couldn't... I
had a problem with Erin last night.

462
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,562
Happy?

463
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,899
I had a lot on my mind last
night, and I didn't perform.

464
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,860
Okay, it happens
to plenty of guys.

465
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:29,283
It's usually not followed by a giant
workplace discussion and an interview.

466
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:36,540
Every guy in this room has been
touched by this affliction. Tuna?

467
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,166
D-Dog!

468
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,251
Um...

469
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:40,919
Um...

470
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,381
I have other issues.

471
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,509
I'm terrible at math,
overweight.

472
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:51,888
You're in great shape. A lot better
shape than I am, tell you what.

473
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:55,684
It seems Andy is the
only one with this problem.

474
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,227
Fascinating.
Fascinating.

475
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:00,355
I don't really see what the problem
is. Erin doesn't even like sex.

476
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,025
Remember? You said it feels
like getting tackled by a skeleton.

477
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,612
Chumbo, come on, help me out.
Any problems with Little Chumbo?

478
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,030
Tip top shape!

479
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,366
Stanley.
No. Mmm-mmm.

480
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,785
Creed, you are
1,000 years old.

481
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,622
Haven't heard any complaints.
Wouldn't care if I did.

482
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,206
Okay, so...
Actually, Andy,

483
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:21,126
I think maybe
we've experienced it.

484
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,210
What happened?

485
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,464
A couple of times.
A couple of times?

486
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,175
Jim, maybe you could tell us
about one of those times.

487
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,551
- Yeah. Get it out there.
- Yeah, Jim.

488
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,677
Um...

489
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,262
I don't...

490
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,434
Uh, yes, that time
that it was very late.

491
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:38,935
Uh...

492
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,856
We had had sex so many
times already, I was exhausted.

493
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,858
Okay, stop. I could barely
see. I was very drunk.

494
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,568
If it makes you
feel any better,

495
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,488
I never had an orgasm
until I was 42.

496
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:53,367
And then when I did,
it lasted until I was 44.

497
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,786
Forty-three was just...

498
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,830
I got nothing done.

499
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,167
I've read, and I don't know
anything about this personally,

500
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,419
but they say prostate
stimulation can help.

501
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,504
Ugh.

502
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,506
This is just a This
American Life I think I heard.

503
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,008
No, that's absolutely
the case. I know, right?

504
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:13,970
You know my rectal electro-ejaculator
is rated for bovine use only,

505
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,055
but I could let you rent it.

506
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:19,726
Andy, why don't you tell us
about the best erection of your life?

507
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:24,106
Or does anyone else have any
remarkable erections they'd like to share?

508
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,357
Wow. Oh! What
are we talking about?

509
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,359
Toby, doesn't HR
have some rules

510
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,819
against talking about
this kind of stuff?

511
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,572
Erin, HR is a joke. I can't
do anything about anything.

512
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:36,660
The most important thing to
remember is do not stress about this.

513
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,121
Stress just makes it worse

514
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,499
and then you stress more,
and that's a vicious spiral.

515
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,585
I almost didn't
come in today.

516
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,922
Dad, don't think
of it as a demotion,

517
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,508
just think of it as a
promotion to a lower level.

518
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,261
I don't think you have to
tell your friends anything.

519
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,679
It hasn't been
decided yet.

520
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,598
Erin, on the phone memos, you're
writing the date American style.

521
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,893
Month, day, year. I
prefer it day, month, year.

522
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,311
Small, bigger, biggest!

523
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,396
Oh!

524
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,523
Sexual innuendo
not intentional.

525
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,818
Shut up. Shut up, liar!

526
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:14,156
"Sexual innuendo
not intentional!"

527
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:17,492
I am sick of
your dumb opinions

528
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:21,705
and if you don't like the way
that I take phone messages, here!

529
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:23,540
Take them yourself!

530
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,254
Our sex life is none
of anyone's business!

531
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,841
And Andy is the manager!
Not Nellie!

532
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:36,136
Stop protecting me! I'm a
man! I can protect myself!

533
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,763
This is misdirected anger
and I'm sorry!

534
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,930
I don't mean to
lash out at you!

535
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,266
There's a lot coming up
right now all at once!

536
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,351
Dad, go to hell!
I'm taller than you!

537
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,312
Okay, just calm down.

538
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,482
You are not the manager.
I earned that job!

539
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,276
I was personally chosen after
Robert was chosen and quit!

540
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,236
Andy, why don't you
just take a seat?

541
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,155
Why don't you
take a seat, idiot?

542
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,700
Why don't you take
all your stupid memos?

543
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,953
And your stupid pens
and your dumb caramels!

544
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,414
And your stupid face!

545
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,083
And your stupid office!

546
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,960
Ah! Ow.

547
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,091
He does not
like that wall.

548
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,807
Maybe we'll get sent to
anger management together.

549
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:27,062
That would actually be cool. I'd
love for you to meet some of the guys.

550
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,902
Andy, Erin,
you can join us now.

551
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,918
What do you like
about Ryan?

552
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,630
Ryan keeps up with all
the latest technology trends.

553
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,591
And he's very honest with me
about when I put on weight.

554
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,470
And he has the soul
and the body of a poet.

555
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,763
Mmm.

556
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:02,931
Ravi's hotter.

557
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,559
I mean, I'm a straight man,
and looks are subjective,

558
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,477
but there's no
question about it.

559
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,062
Yeah, but I'm just worried

560
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,272
that I'm only
attracted to Ravi

561
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,316
because he looks exactly like this
Calvin Klein model that I'm attracted to.

562
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,693
Who cares? That's fine.

563
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,279
When I was your age, I had to
choose between a Ryan and a Ravi,

564
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,738
and I chose the Ryan.

565
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,117
And if I hadn't,
I wouldn't have my Kids.

566
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,120
You'd still have kids.

567
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,582
Better kids. You've
got to go with Ravi.

568
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,794
Here's my advice. Figure
out what your heart wants.

569
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,797
And if it's not Ravi,
change it. To Ravi.

570
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,847
I don't understand why
this is a dilemma for you.

571
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,766
He has, like,
this je ne sais quoi.

572
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,477
He taught me that.

573
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,274
Ravi makes me
incredibly happy.

574
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,902
And Ryan puts me
through so much drama.

575
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,278
So I guess I just
have to decide

576
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,989
which of those is
more important to me.

577
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:05,076
Andy, we're going to go
with Nellie as manager

578
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,162
and put you back
on the sales team.

579
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:11,833
I promise you, in time, we'll
all laugh about this incident.

580
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,377
I already think it's kind
of funny.

581
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,594
No.

582
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:24,888
Excuse me?

583
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,223
I'm saying no.

584
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,518
Well, you can't say no.

585
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,103
No.

586
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,234
Oh. Boo!

587
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,569
Holy crap!

588
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,490
Boo! Boo! Boo to you. Pam,
you are toxic. You are toxic.

589
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,702
Kelly, I have a few things to say
to you, but please don't interrupt.

590
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,288
I wasn't going to interrupt. Yeah,
but you do a lot, so just don't.

591
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,958
Thank you. I know that I
haven't always treated you

592
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,001
the way that you,
for whatever reason,

593
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,337
feel you deserve
to be treated.

594
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,214
But I want to marry you,
Kelly Kapoor.

595
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:03,468
Maybe not today, maybe
not tomorrow, but some day.

596
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:04,970
And probably!

597
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,639
Barf! Oh! You suck!

598
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,140
What is your problem?

599
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,601
Hey, can we turn this
back around quickly please?

600
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,728
Can we turn this around quickly?
This is very important to me.

601
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,147
Turn around.
Turn around.

602
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,483
Can we turn this
thing around, please? Thank you.

603
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,402
She don't want to turn
around. Thank you.

604
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,948
Kelly, I can't promise you
that we'll always stay together,

605
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,159
I can't promise you that I'll
never cheat on you. Nor should 1.

606
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,996
Modern marriages aren't built
that way. Men aren't built that way.

607
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,914
There's a very interesting
article I can email to you.

608
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,709
But I can tell you this,
even if the odds are 50-50

609
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,669
that we'll break up
within the week,

610
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,879
I want to roll those dice.

611
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,757
I love you, Kelly.
Ryan.

612
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,092
Will you roll
those dice with me?

613
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,095
You mean so much to me.

614
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,099
But I love Ravi and I
choose him. No, you don't.

615
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,183
I do.
No, you don't.

616
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,144
I hope we can
still be friends.

617
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,274
Can I have a hug?

618
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,491
Oh. Ew!

619
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,411
Well, it's good to see
Kelly is maturing.

620
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,371
Oh, God!

621
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:18,376
Look, Andrew, we can discuss
the specifics of the job.

622
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:19,878
No.

623
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,255
It's the apology.
I really have to insist.

624
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,299
Stop saying "no." "

625
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,633
No.

626
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,803
Andrew, if you say "no"
one more time, you're fired.

627
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:33,391
So, is there anything
else you want to say?

628
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:35,810
No.

629
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,271
I can't describe it. I just, for
the first time in a long time,

630
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,898
I actually feel in control.

631
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,610
I feel alive.

632
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,612
Here.

633
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,696
I got it.

634
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,033
But you hurt
your hand. I got it.

635
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,869
Right now?
Yes.

636
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,637
You're not the
least bit curious

637
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,556
to hear a poem straight
from Ryan's soul?

638
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,724
Not at all.
Can we go?

639
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,477
"Kapoor and Ka-desperate,
he watches."

640
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,188
Second line! "He is
a drifter out to sea."

641
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,692
"And when the Indian Ocean
calms, one speck of white remains

642
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,862
"in waters cold
and Kelly green."

643
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,781
It's just so dumb.

644
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:36,079
But when he describes himself
as a child lost on a life raft...

645
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,792
Ryan can never know.
