1
00:00:02,674 --> 00:00:05,811
Your father was one of
Napoleon's bravest colonels.

2
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:08,209
I never knew him because of you!

3
00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:10,779
Get out! I never want
to see you again!

4
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:13,959
I've seen nothing of the world yet...
I want to see for myself.

5
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:16,319
I want to be a citizen
of the Republic,

6
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:18,059
not a subject of the King.

7
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,288
We'll all be fighting to
the death about that.

8
00:00:20,313 --> 00:00:23,059
What side will you be on,
my friend?

9
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:24,929
What's your name?
Cosette.

10
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:28,139
You could find out where they live.

11
00:00:28,164 --> 00:00:31,288
The old man and the girl.
The girl you're sweet on? Depends.

12
00:00:31,313 --> 00:00:32,569
What do I get?

13
00:00:32,594 --> 00:00:35,649
I am convinced that he is
still alive and here in Paris.

14
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,168
You wouldn't want no harm to
come to your pretty daughter now...

15
00:00:40,193 --> 00:00:42,089
You dare to threaten my Cosette?

16
00:00:42,114 --> 00:00:43,569
Now do your worst!

17
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:49,319
Shame you missed the real prize,
Inspector.

18
00:00:50,554 --> 00:00:51,729
Papa!

19
00:00:51,754 --> 00:00:54,209
I shall never be at peace
until he is back in chains.

20
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:24,418
Liberte! Liberte!

21
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:49,609
I want more men on the street,
Rivette.

22
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:52,009
Now that we know he's here,
it's imperative that we find him

23
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,418
and get him into custody! Coat!

24
00:01:53,443 --> 00:01:57,609
Sir, if I might suggest...
Suggest what? Speak out, man!

25
00:01:57,634 --> 00:01:59,329
Surely, sir, it's more important

26
00:01:59,354 --> 00:02:01,529
to respond to these
intelligence reports.

27
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:05,139
We've got workers' groups openly
discussing violent revolution.

28
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:07,889
Three illegal arms factories
unearthed this week.

29
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:09,418
He is here, Rivette.

30
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:12,168
He has been in Paris all
this time, laughing at us.

31
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:13,889
Well, this time he will
not get away.

32
00:02:13,914 --> 00:02:16,969
With respect, sir, we're facing
severe problems of public order.

33
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:19,779
Surely our focus should be
on these larger issues.

34
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:22,679
There is no larger issue, man!

35
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:24,139
Mark my words,

36
00:02:24,164 --> 00:02:27,889
wherever you find unrest, he
will be at the very heart of it.

37
00:02:29,273 --> 00:02:31,649
So what orders am I to give
the men, sir?

38
00:02:31,674 --> 00:02:33,939
I want that man found,

39
00:02:33,964 --> 00:02:38,248
arrested, and brought to justice.

40
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:41,529
And as for that scoundrel Thenardier...

41
00:02:41,554 --> 00:02:44,329
...go and arrange for his
transfer to the prison hulks.

42
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:11,498
You should never have gone back there.

43
00:03:13,244 --> 00:03:15,969
Those people there - they are evil.

44
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:19,048
Yes.

45
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,449
But I had to.

46
00:03:21,474 --> 00:03:23,689
I had to go back.

47
00:03:27,714 --> 00:03:29,329
I hope I never see them again.

48
00:03:46,244 --> 00:03:48,779
Step back from the gate! Back!

49
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:54,969
Corday!

50
00:03:58,114 --> 00:03:59,939
Famigasse!
That's me!

51
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:03,059
Jondrette, Azelma!

52
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:04,689
Jondrette, Eponine!

53
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,585
Come on, girls, come on.

54
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,939
Not you.

55
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:13,189
Jondrette Rosalie! Check your
list! Have a look at it!

56
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:16,338
Assaulting a police officer
with intent to murder?

57
00:04:16,363 --> 00:04:18,059
I don't think so!

58
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:20,189
Get back or you get this!

59
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:22,138
You two, out!

60
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:24,189
You can't take my daughters from me.

61
00:04:26,444 --> 00:04:28,338
You can't take my daughters from me!

62
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:41,749
They're saying General Lamarque is dying.

63
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:44,218
He won't last more than a couple of weeks.

64
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,659
One old soldier on his last legs?

65
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:49,018
I mean, what difference does that make?

66
00:04:49,043 --> 00:04:52,549
Lamarque was one of the last heroes
who stood up for the common man.

67
00:04:52,574 --> 00:04:54,018
He fought in the Revolution

68
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,829
and he's been on our side ever since.

69
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,468
There's bound to be a huge
demonstration at his funeral.

70
00:05:04,493 --> 00:05:05,909
That'll be where it starts.

71
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:09,059
Workers are coming out all over Paris.

72
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:11,268
And they are ready for new leaders.

73
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:16,499
This is where we can take our
place in history.

74
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,379
We have arms, and we have ammunition.

75
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:21,989
If we can provoke the army to attack,

76
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:24,348
the people will rise up in anger.

77
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:39,549
Found you!

78
00:05:39,574 --> 00:05:41,189
Found you!

79
00:05:41,214 --> 00:05:44,779
I've been looking everywhere for you.

80
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:47,348
I've got to say, you're a
bit of a sorry sight.

81
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:49,579
You've got straw in your hair.

82
00:05:49,604 --> 00:05:53,549
Fiddle. And I was trying
to look nice for you.

83
00:05:56,854 --> 00:05:58,749
You don't look very pleased to see me.

84
00:06:00,884 --> 00:06:03,218
I could make you happy if I wanted to.

85
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:05,388
Remember you promised me
anything I wanted,

86
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:07,109
if I found you a certain address?

87
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,189
Well, I've got it.

88
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:10,629
What?

89
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:12,579
The address of that young lady.

90
00:06:12,604 --> 00:06:14,909
Give it to me now.
I could take you there.

91
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:26,069
Swear to me you won't tell
your father where they live.

92
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,379
You don't have to worry about
him, he's locked up in jail.

93
00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:30,859
All the same, swear it!
All right! I swear!

94
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:34,779
Good. Take me there now.

95
00:06:34,804 --> 00:06:37,218
Ooh, you're keen, ain't you?
Remember what you promised me.

96
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:38,939
Anything I wanted.

97
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:40,659
Yeah. Right.

98
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:03,368
Where's the prisoner?

99
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:05,679
Didn't you hear? He snuffed it.

100
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:08,569
Cholera, we think. It's
been spreading like wildfire.

101
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:13,129
Come on.
Quick!

102
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:19,238
He was fine the last time I saw him.

103
00:07:21,424 --> 00:07:22,849
Come on!

104
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:47,879
Cosette.

105
00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:52,009
I have to go away for a couple of days.

106
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:53,599
Will you take me with you?

107
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:55,089
It wouldn't be safe.

108
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:58,569
Don't worry - the Thenardiers
are all in jail,

109
00:07:58,594 --> 00:08:00,129
and no-one else knows we're here.

110
00:08:01,794 --> 00:08:04,009
But are you well enough?

111
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:05,599
Yes.

112
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:08,089
Don't leave the house until I'm back.

113
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:09,729
When do you leave?

114
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:11,288
This evening.

115
00:08:12,393 --> 00:08:15,649
Don't worry. Toussaint
will look after you.

116
00:08:40,164 --> 00:08:42,238
This is really it?
You're sure?

117
00:08:42,263 --> 00:08:43,849
I'm sure.

118
00:08:43,874 --> 00:08:45,238
Thank you.

119
00:08:53,674 --> 00:08:55,399
Uh'.!

120
00:08:55,424 --> 00:08:57,889
It's all I have on me. I'm sorry.

121
00:09:01,393 --> 00:09:03,238
I don't want your money!

122
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:05,009
Don't you understand anything?

123
00:09:08,874 --> 00:09:10,238
Oh, come on!

124
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,959
I'm really very grateful!

125
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,929
Warder!

126
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:43,599
So you just let him walk out of here?

127
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,209
I thought he was dead, sir.

128
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:47,649
Rivette?
I'm very sorry, sir.

129
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:50,529
He got away.
You are dismissed.

130
00:09:50,554 --> 00:09:52,569
Yes, sir.

131
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:58,089
When we capture Jean Valjean,
there can be no mistakes!

132
00:10:46,424 --> 00:10:48,649
The master escapologist!

133
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:50,288
The man they couldn't hold!

134
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:52,609
With one bound, he was free!

135
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:56,529
Here in my subterranean kingdom,
I rule!

136
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:58,679
I challenge!

137
00:10:58,704 --> 00:11:00,529
Oh, shut your hole!

138
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:02,248
You nearly got us all done.

139
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:06,219
But I'll tell you one thing.

140
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:09,679
I'm going to get my own back on that
old sod who stole my stepdaughter.

141
00:11:09,704 --> 00:11:12,168
He was the one that almost
got us done, if you remember!

142
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:15,649
He's got a big house round here.

143
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:19,168
All secret and tucked away.
We've seen it.

144
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:20,649
We followed him...

145
00:11:22,034 --> 00:11:24,118
...after he jumped out of
your window.

146
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:28,809
Well, we'll do his house...

147
00:11:29,994 --> 00:11:31,368
...then we'll do him.

148
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:33,729
Yeah?

149
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:57,168
Toussaint?

150
00:11:57,193 --> 00:12:00,009
Are you careful to
bar the shutters at night?

151
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:02,969
Oh, you needn't worry,
Mademoiselle. No-one can get in.

152
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:06,168
And if they did, you'd be killed
before you knew anything about it.

153
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,248
Toussaint!

154
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:08,649
Just saying-

155
00:13:11,354 --> 00:13:13,689
"Does she still come
to the Luxembourg Gardens?

156
00:13:14,914 --> 00:13:16,329
"What a terrible thing,

157
00:13:16,354 --> 00:13:18,609
"for a man not to know
the address of his soul.

158
00:13:18,634 --> 00:13:20,449
"I live in darkness now.

159
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:23,529
"There is someone who went away,
taking the sky with her.

160
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:26,769
"Oh, to lie in that same tomb,
holding hands,

161
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:29,889
"and gently to caress each
other's fingers in the shadows,

162
00:13:29,914 --> 00:13:32,089
"that would satisfy me
for all eternity..."

163
00:13:32,114 --> 00:13:33,298
It's him!

164
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:36,168
He's found me!

165
00:15:18,694 --> 00:15:20,309
Forgive me, forgive me.

166
00:15:31,493 --> 00:15:33,388
Did you read my letter?

167
00:15:38,132 --> 00:15:39,308
Yes.

168
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:54,558
Do you remember?

169
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,558
The Luxembourg Gardens,
when we spoke?

170
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:01,868
Yes.

171
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,438
Of course.

172
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,918
What's the matter?

173
00:16:08,943 --> 00:16:10,798
I can't feel...

174
00:16:25,413 --> 00:16:26,748
Oh, Cosette.

175
00:17:11,893 --> 00:17:13,198
Thieving little brats!

176
00:17:13,223 --> 00:17:14,998
Go on! Scum!

177
00:17:21,213 --> 00:17:22,388
Here!

178
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:23,868
Come here. What's the matter?

179
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,718
Please, sir, we're lost.

180
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:31,998
We've got nothing to eat
and nowhere to sleep.

181
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:34,828
And you go begging in a barber's
shop? What did you think you'll get?

182
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,388
A free haircut?!

183
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:38,438
You'd better come along
with me. Come on.

184
00:17:39,663 --> 00:17:42,558
Bonjour, monsieur!
No begging here.

185
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,468
We're paying customers,
my good man!

186
00:17:44,493 --> 00:17:46,948
Five centime's worth of bread
for my young friends and me,

187
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:49,157
if you would be so good.

188
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:56,157
Merci, monsieur! Au revoir!

189
00:17:57,413 --> 00:18:00,518
Remember. If you're begging
for food,

190
00:18:00,543 --> 00:18:02,468
it's the baker, not the barber.

191
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:04,668
Au revoir, mes petites!

192
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:42,188
The

193
00:18:42,213 --> 00:18:44,277
General Lamarque is dead.

194
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:47,078
Everyone will be coming onto
the streets for his funeral.

195
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:50,438
They are ready in Les Halles,
they are ready in St-jacques.

196
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,998
We have promises that half
the army will be with us.

197
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:55,798
Another revolution? Is it
really going to happen?

198
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:57,308
Don't take my word for it.

199
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,718
Hear it from the workers.

200
00:18:58,743 --> 00:19:01,188
Despiat? Is it going to happen?

201
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:04,308
Well, it's happening already,
my friend, and if you're not with us,

202
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,828
then you're part of the enemy,
so make up your minds.

203
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:09,308
You rich students can go back
to your families in the country,

204
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,948
but the poor, we have to live here.

205
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:13,257
We've been squeezed so hard,
we have nothing to lose.

206
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:15,818
I am ready to die in this fight.

207
00:19:15,843 --> 00:19:17,297
Are you?

208
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:21,127
Is it really going to come
to all that?

209
00:19:21,152 --> 00:19:23,458
Go home, Grantaire.
This isn't a game.

210
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:24,768
Co u rfeyra c?

211
00:19:26,202 --> 00:19:28,208
You can count on me.

212
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:35,618
And Marius Pontmercy?

213
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:38,047
Oh, no. He's in his own world.

214
00:19:38,072 --> 00:19:39,898
He's found his angel.

215
00:19:39,923 --> 00:19:43,018
He's been staying with me
and speaks of nothing else.

216
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:44,978
I don't see him on the barricade.

217
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:49,768
Well, we have no need of his sort.

218
00:19:49,793 --> 00:19:52,978
All we need now is a spark
to set off the powder keg,

219
00:19:53,003 --> 00:19:55,297
and all Paris could go up in flames!

220
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:57,408
And the government will be torn
to bits!

221
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:00,818
I'm with you!

222
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:03,848
Truly?

223
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:06,408
To the death.

224
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:09,297
To the death.

225
00:20:34,723 --> 00:20:37,818
Lamarque is dead.
Good riddance to him!

226
00:20:37,843 --> 00:20:39,898
The last hope of the left!

227
00:20:39,923 --> 00:20:44,738
To think, they expected him to be
buried with full military honours,

228
00:20:44,763 --> 00:20:47,127
in the Pantheon, no less!

229
00:20:48,563 --> 00:20:50,948
He can rot in hell
for all I care.

230
00:20:50,973 --> 00:20:53,377
Along with the idle scum
who follow him!

231
00:20:54,763 --> 00:20:57,538
Come on, Gillenormand.
What do you say?

232
00:20:57,563 --> 00:20:59,408
Oh, absolutely.

233
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:01,458
Ag reed, agreed!

234
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:05,458
Poor fellow.
He's not the man he was.

235
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:21,818
Welcome home, monsieur.

236
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:23,127
Thank you, Toussaint.

237
00:21:23,152 --> 00:21:24,377
Is everything all right?

238
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:25,658
Yes.

239
00:21:27,082 --> 00:21:29,768
And Cosette?
Oh, fine.

240
00:21:29,793 --> 00:21:32,257
Thank you.
Ti
I can get you, Monsieur?

241
00:21:32,282 --> 00:21:34,377
No, thank you. Thank you, Toussaint.

242
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:39,618
Welcome home, Papa!
My Cosette!

243
00:21:41,723 --> 00:21:43,257
You're safe.

244
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,458
Come on, I have something
important to tell you.

245
00:22:14,873 --> 00:22:16,568
So that's how you do it.

246
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:46,898
This is the house.

247
00:22:46,923 --> 00:22:48,568
This is the house.

248
00:22:49,843 --> 00:22:51,818
Ha! Not bad!

249
00:22:53,313 --> 00:22:55,177
Do you know if they've got a cab?

250
00:22:55,202 --> 00:22:58,257
A what?
A guard dog.
Has he got one?

251
00:22:58,282 --> 00:22:59,738
Well, I don't know!

252
00:22:59,763 --> 00:23:03,057
I've got some meatballs soaked
in sleepy juice, just in case.

253
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:05,028
And a knife for the
old man's throat.

254
00:23:07,082 --> 00:23:09,098
It's an old door.
We'll soon be through that...

255
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:11,668
No, you won't!
The dog'll have your throats out!

256
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:13,057
Jesus Christ, who's that?!

257
00:23:13,082 --> 00:23:14,418
Your daughter.

258
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:17,538
So you got out of jail, did you?
Straight back into trouble.

259
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:21,208
Give it up! He's got guns!
He'll blow your heads off your shoulders!

260
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,698
He won't know we're there
till it's too late.

261
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:25,288
Help! Monsieur!

262
00:23:27,843 --> 00:23:30,818
You go in. I'll stay
out here with the girl.

263
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,978
If she makes a sound,
she gets this.

264
00:23:33,003 --> 00:23:34,668
Yeah, well, it's
all the same to me.

265
00:23:34,693 --> 00:23:36,848
You'd let him slit my throat?
Your own daughter?

266
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,307
Fine father you are!

267
00:23:41,723 --> 00:23:43,848
Oh! Now look what you've
gone and done!

268
00:23:43,873 --> 00:23:45,978
I don't fancy this.
I'm out.

269
00:23:46,003 --> 00:23:47,818
Come on, lads.
What d'you say?

270
00:23:48,873 --> 00:23:50,568
There's always tomorrow night.

271
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:52,137
Right, let's just go,
all right?

272
00:23:52,162 --> 00:23:53,978
This is all down to you,
this is!

273
00:23:54,003 --> 00:23:56,108
Yeah, all right!
Tomorrow night!

274
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:57,858
And you! Keep your
beak out of it!

275
00:23:57,883 --> 00:23:59,458
I'm not scared of you.

276
00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:11,338
My darling!

277
00:24:17,053 --> 00:24:20,538
Papa's back, and he told me to
make ready. We're going away soon.

278
00:24:20,563 --> 00:24:22,057
Going where?

279
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:23,618
To England.

280
00:24:25,563 --> 00:24:27,108
For how long?

281
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,137
I don't know.
I think he meant for good.

282
00:24:39,723 --> 00:24:41,387
I won't let us be parted.

283
00:24:41,412 --> 00:24:43,288
I couldn't live
without you anyway.

284
00:24:43,313 --> 00:24:45,748
I'll find some way for us
to be together,

285
00:24:45,773 --> 00:24:47,108
here or in England.

286
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:49,057
Now listen. I have to go.

287
00:24:51,133 --> 00:24:52,748
There's something I've got to do.

288
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:56,468
But tomorrow, at the stroke of five,
I'll be here, in the garden.

289
00:24:56,493 --> 00:24:58,927
But what's your plan?
How are we to be together?

290
00:24:58,952 --> 00:25:00,568
We will.

291
00:25:00,593 --> 00:25:02,568
We will somehow.

292
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:06,108
Oh, Cosette. Cosette.

293
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:19,338
Until tomorrow, my love.

294
00:25:39,883 --> 00:25:41,538
Psst, Monsieur.

295
00:25:47,282 --> 00:25:48,937
What are you doing here?

296
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:50,288
How did you get in?

297
00:25:50,313 --> 00:25:52,978
Anyone can get in, you've
got a wonky railing. Listen.

298
00:25:53,003 --> 00:25:55,578
I've come to warn you,
a gang's coming to rob you tomorrow night.

299
00:25:55,603 --> 00:25:57,187
So you better move, and sharpish.

300
00:25:57,212 --> 00:25:59,778
Why should I believe you?
You better.

301
00:25:59,803 --> 00:26:01,538
My dad's in the gang.

302
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:04,578
Bye-bye, Mister.

303
00:26:16,673 --> 00:26:19,668
Monsieur. Will you receive
Monsieur Marius?

304
00:26:19,693 --> 00:26:22,468
He's here.
He wants to talk to you.

305
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:25,137
Well, didn't I always
say he'd be back?

306
00:26:26,773 --> 00:26:29,338
He wouldn't forget
his old grandfather!

307
00:26:29,363 --> 00:26:31,187
Show him in, show him in!

308
00:26:31,212 --> 00:26:32,778
The rascal!

309
00:26:40,962 --> 00:26:42,387
Monsieur Marius.

310
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:48,618
Have you come to ask my forgiveness, eh?

311
00:26:48,643 --> 00:26:53,658
Have you come to your senses and
realised you were in the wrong?

312
00:26:53,803 --> 00:26:54,908
Is that it?

313
00:26:55,962 --> 00:26:58,218
Come on, boy. Spit it out.

314
00:26:58,243 --> 00:26:59,498
What is it?

315
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:04,108
Monsieur. I've come to ask
your permission to marry.

316
00:27:06,683 --> 00:27:07,978
To marry?

317
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:10,698
Well!

318
00:27:10,723 --> 00:27:12,978
Who's the girl?

319
00:27:13,003 --> 00:27:15,257
Her name is Mademoiselle Fauchelevent.

320
00:27:15,282 --> 00:27:17,137
Never heard of her.

321
00:27:17,162 --> 00:27:19,778
But, er... She's, er...

322
00:27:19,803 --> 00:27:21,218
...rich?

323
00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:26,937
Penniless. So!

324
00:27:26,962 --> 00:27:31,858
You want to plunge into misery
with a woman round your neck, do you?

325
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:35,298
And you need my money, no doubt.

326
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:37,338
Well, sit down.

327
00:27:37,363 --> 00:27:39,698
Tell me all about it.

328
00:27:41,683 --> 00:27:46,187
You rogue. You've got her
in trouble, haven't you?

329
00:27:46,212 --> 00:27:47,548
No!

330
00:27:47,573 --> 00:27:51,418
I've had affairs like that,
my boy, and plenty of them!

331
00:27:52,773 --> 00:27:56,298
Well, the young must live,

332
00:27:56,323 --> 00:27:58,498
and the old must die,

333
00:27:58,523 --> 00:28:00,628
that's the way of it.

334
00:28:00,653 --> 00:28:03,298
Here's 2,000 francs.

335
00:28:03,323 --> 00:28:07,137
You can set her up in a
nice little love nest,

336
00:28:07,162 --> 00:28:09,267
if you're so fond of her.

337
00:28:09,292 --> 00:28:11,658
But you don't want to marry her!

338
00:28:11,683 --> 00:28:15,418
Make her your mistress,
you silly boy!

339
00:28:16,523 --> 00:28:17,978
That's the way it's done!

340
00:28:22,523 --> 00:28:25,468
Monsieur, the last time we were
together, you insulted my father.

341
00:28:27,323 --> 00:28:29,418
Today, you insult my wife.

342
00:28:29,443 --> 00:28:32,057
I shall never ask anything
from you ever again.

343
00:28:32,082 --> 00:28:34,108
Farewell.

344
00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:37,298
What's the matter with him?

345
00:28:37,323 --> 00:28:38,988
What have I said?

346
00:28:39,013 --> 00:28:40,548
Marius!

347
00:28:40,573 --> 00:28:42,908
Marius, come back!

348
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:44,698
Let's discuss this like men!

349
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,267
Marius!

350
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:48,418
Don't leave me!

351
00:28:54,653 --> 00:28:57,267
He's gone. He's gone.

352
00:29:09,493 --> 00:29:11,628
Just mind your heads...

353
00:29:14,443 --> 00:29:15,908
Get ready, Marius.

354
00:29:18,212 --> 00:29:19,578
For what?

355
00:29:19,603 --> 00:29:22,348
It's General Lamarque's
funeral procession today.

356
00:29:22,373 --> 00:29:23,628
Are you coming, or not?

357
00:29:23,653 --> 00:29:26,057
Aren't you supposed to
be a Napoleonist democrat?

358
00:29:26,082 --> 00:29:28,858
Lamarque fought for Napoleon.

359
00:29:28,883 --> 00:29:31,498
He should be buried in
the Pantheon as a hero!

360
00:29:31,523 --> 00:29:33,937
But instead, they're
treating him like dirt.

361
00:29:33,962 --> 00:29:36,378
What would your father
want you to do, Marius?

362
00:29:38,493 --> 00:29:40,108
Are you with us or not?

363
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:44,988
I can't.

364
00:29:45,013 --> 00:29:47,298
Leave him.

365
00:29:47,323 --> 00:29:49,034
We don't need any
romantic daydreamers,

366
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:50,549
or lovesick schoolboys.

367
00:29:52,214 --> 00:29:54,799
We are going to force
the army to strike.

368
00:29:56,344 --> 00:29:58,158
This isn't for the likes of you.

369
00:29:58,183 --> 00:30:00,189
There might be some rough stuff.

370
00:30:01,263 --> 00:30:02,799
Come on, lads.

371
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,269
Papa.

372
00:30:54,574 --> 00:30:56,519
What's wrong?
We must move today.

373
00:30:56,544 --> 00:30:58,399
We can't stay in this
house any more.

374
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:00,158
To England?

375
00:31:00,183 --> 00:31:01,679
Already?

376
00:31:01,704 --> 00:31:03,908
That'll take time.
It's not safe to travel.

377
00:31:03,933 --> 00:31:06,629
We're moving to a secret
address, here in Paris.

378
00:31:06,654 --> 00:31:09,038
But how would anyone know
how to find us?

379
00:31:10,984 --> 00:31:13,189
Is there someone you
wish to be found by?

380
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:16,829
No.

381
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:20,879
No!

382
00:31:22,374 --> 00:31:24,079
Make yourself ready.

383
00:31:24,104 --> 00:31:25,439
We leave in an hour.

384
00:31:29,574 --> 00:31:31,319
We will take only the essentials.

385
00:31:31,344 --> 00:31:34,719
Be ready as soon as you can.
Of course, Monsieur, right away.

386
00:31:39,263 --> 00:31:40,469
Toussaint?

387
00:31:40,494 --> 00:31:42,679
Do you know the address
of where we're going to?

388
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:44,469
Papa did tell me,
but it's slipped my mind.

389
00:31:44,494 --> 00:31:46,469
Rue de I'Homme-Arme, number 7.

390
00:31:46,494 --> 00:31:48,189
Don't worry my dear,
all will be well.

391
00:31:56,013 --> 00:31:58,269
"My beloved Marius.

392
00:31:58,294 --> 00:32:02,079
"We go to Rue de I'Homme-Arme,
number 7.

393
00:32:04,374 --> 00:32:06,829
"Please come, or
send word tonight.

394
00:32:08,183 --> 00:32:09,519
"I love you.

395
00:32:09,544 --> 00:32:12,349
"I love you, I love you."

396
00:32:55,143 --> 00:32:58,908
Not the finest view in the world,
but it's not so bad, this place.

397
00:33:01,704 --> 00:33:03,549
What is it, Cosette?
What's the matter?

398
00:33:04,824 --> 00:33:06,629
Nothing, really,
it's nothing.

399
00:33:45,294 --> 00:33:47,479
They'll try to trap us
in Bastille.

400
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:52,549
They won't.

401
00:33:57,904 --> 00:33:59,519
This is it.

402
00:34:01,094 --> 00:34:03,118
Lamarque to the Pantheon!

403
00:34:04,504 --> 00:34:05,879
Lamarque to the Pantheon!

404
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,118
Get out!

405
00:34:15,294 --> 00:34:17,629
Get back! Get out of our way!
Go no further!

406
00:34:19,704 --> 00:34:22,158
Lamarque to the Pantheon!

407
00:35:06,374 --> 00:35:08,399
Charge!

408
00:35:24,304 --> 00:35:25,679
Somebody help me!

409
00:36:32,213 --> 00:36:34,419
Citizens! Citizens!

410
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:35,859
Your hand, your hand!
Hold that.

411
00:36:35,884 --> 00:36:38,018
Citizens! Citizens!

412
00:36:39,684 --> 00:36:42,549
Citizens, now is the
time to make our stand!

413
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:48,188
We must build a barricade!

414
00:36:48,213 --> 00:36:51,499
Our fellow fighters will be
doing the same across the city.

415
00:36:51,524 --> 00:36:54,659
We must divide the focus
of the military,

416
00:36:54,684 --> 00:36:57,219
and make this city ungovernable!

417
00:36:58,963 --> 00:37:01,829
And defend this barricade
to the death!

418
00:37:03,494 --> 00:37:06,379
It's very handy that it's
right next to a pub!

419
00:37:10,324 --> 00:37:11,779
Welcome, Despiat.

420
00:37:11,804 --> 00:37:12,909
Comrade.

421
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,499
This is the perfect place.

422
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,629
There's only one line of attack.

423
00:37:16,654 --> 00:37:19,779
Gather everything you can
and start building!

424
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,699
Come on, comrades!

425
00:37:50,684 --> 00:37:52,339
Well done, Matelote.

426
00:37:52,364 --> 00:37:53,859
Come here.

427
00:37:53,884 --> 00:37:56,699
I embrace you as a comrade.

428
00:37:59,524 --> 00:38:01,909
Get off me, you ape!

429
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:13,549
Sir, the army has lost
control of the city.

430
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:15,268
The streets are in chaos.

431
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,138
It's more than likely that
Valjean has fled Paris by now.

432
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:20,449
I doubt that. He'll be
in the midst of them.

433
00:38:20,474 --> 00:38:22,299
And that's where I'll find him.

434
00:38:22,324 --> 00:38:25,188
I beg you, sir, this is
too dangerous. Send someone else.

435
00:38:25,213 --> 00:38:26,829
I wouldn't trust anyone else.

436
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:40,829
Monsieur! You don't want
to be outdoors today!

437
00:38:40,854 --> 00:38:43,188
Oh, I think I do, my boy.

438
00:38:48,764 --> 00:38:50,268
Be careful with the gunpowder.

439
00:38:51,764 --> 00:38:53,938
Here. Pass this on.

440
00:39:00,444 --> 00:39:02,499
20 bullets per man, no more.

441
00:39:02,524 --> 00:39:03,779
Use them wisely.

442
00:39:03,804 --> 00:39:05,629
Good work, citizens.

443
00:39:05,654 --> 00:39:07,739
Monsieur, best go home.

444
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:09,829
No, I don't think I will.

445
00:39:10,963 --> 00:39:12,739
Time to do my bit.

446
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,219
Good work.

447
00:39:41,374 --> 00:39:44,829
Is a man named
Jean Valjean with us?

448
00:39:44,854 --> 00:39:46,859
Not that I know of.

449
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:50,138
He'll be in the thick of it,
mark my words.

450
00:40:25,574 --> 00:40:26,818
Cosette?

451
00:41:03,925 --> 00:41:05,420
Cosette!

452
00:41:15,235 --> 00:41:16,570
No!

453
00:41:16,595 --> 00:41:18,420
Let me go!

454
00:41:18,445 --> 00:41:21,809
I can't let you go!
It's not safe!

455
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:27,980
Listen! Listen!

456
00:41:28,005 --> 00:41:29,900
There's fighting all over Paris!

457
00:41:29,925 --> 00:41:32,450
You can't keep me
shut up here forever!

458
00:41:32,475 --> 00:41:33,570
Cosette!

459
00:41:33,595 --> 00:41:37,259
Where will you go?
Let me go!
Cosette!
Let me go!

460
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:40,009
I hate you!

461
00:41:51,525 --> 00:41:53,009
Cosette!

462
00:42:00,645 --> 00:42:02,009
Monsieur Marius?

463
00:42:05,115 --> 00:42:06,420
Eponine.

464
00:42:06,445 --> 00:42:09,179
There's no point
waiting around here.

465
00:42:09,204 --> 00:42:10,900
She's gone.

466
00:42:10,925 --> 00:42:14,210
And your pals are over at the
barricade on Rue de la Chanvrerie.

467
00:42:16,195 --> 00:42:17,860
It's just me and you.

468
00:42:19,365 --> 00:42:21,059
I've lost everything.

469
00:42:23,595 --> 00:42:25,259
My life is over.

470
00:42:25,284 --> 00:42:27,980
Ah, come on, Monsieur Marius,
don't be like that.

471
00:42:29,565 --> 00:42:32,700
Rue de la Chanvrerie, you say?
That's it.

472
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:35,500
Right.

473
00:42:35,525 --> 00:42:37,570
That's as good a place
to die as anywhere.

474
00:42:37,595 --> 00:42:40,370
You don't have to get yourself
killed, Monsieur Marius.

475
00:42:40,395 --> 00:42:42,900
Keep your head down,
and live to fight another day.

476
00:42:42,925 --> 00:42:45,370
What's the point in living,
if I've lost Cosette?

477
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,059
Monsieur Marius...

478
00:42:52,084 --> 00:42:53,809
Just leave me alone!

479
00:43:11,805 --> 00:43:13,650
Vive la Revolution!

480
00:43:23,365 --> 00:43:25,420
Looking good, comrades.

481
00:43:25,445 --> 00:43:28,340
Good to see you too, comrade.
I thought you'd given up on us.

482
00:43:28,365 --> 00:43:29,700
Not me.

483
00:43:47,885 --> 00:43:49,139
M

484
00:43:49,164 --> 00:43:50,650
He's a copper.

485
00:43:56,195 --> 00:43:58,009
Seize that man.

486
00:43:59,925 --> 00:44:01,809
Get off me!

487
00:44:12,555 --> 00:44:14,220
Where is he?!

488
00:44:14,245 --> 00:44:16,809
Your leader!
Jean Valjean.

489
00:44:16,834 --> 00:44:18,530
I've never heard of him.

490
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:19,980
Inspector Javert.

491
00:44:20,005 --> 00:44:24,139
There are no leaders here.
That's where you're mistaken, my friend.

492
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:26,009
You've all been led astray.

493
00:44:26,034 --> 00:44:27,500
Can I shoot him?

494
00:44:27,525 --> 00:44:29,220
We're not assassins.

495
00:44:29,245 --> 00:44:30,980
He can stay where he is.

496
00:44:31,005 --> 00:44:33,420
He can tell us what he
knows about the army's plans.

497
00:44:49,365 --> 00:44:51,059
They're coming!

498
00:44:51,084 --> 00:44:52,660
Quickly!

499
00:45:01,705 --> 00:45:03,400
All right, boys, this is it.

500
00:45:32,944 --> 00:45:35,150
Company, halt!

501
00:45:39,274 --> 00:45:41,119
Present arms!

502
00:45:43,175 --> 00:45:45,070
Get down!

503
00:45:45,095 --> 00:45:46,510
Fire!

504
00:45:52,225 --> 00:45:54,430
Wait for my signal!

505
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:57,610
Present arms!

506
00:45:58,665 --> 00:46:00,070
Fire!

507
00:46:07,894 --> 00:46:09,999
Fixed bayonets!

508
00:46:15,894 --> 00:46:17,869
Stop! Hold your powder!

509
00:46:17,894 --> 00:46:19,039
Get down!

510
00:46:19,064 --> 00:46:20,320
Wait for them to advance!

511
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:22,039
Save your bullets!

512
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:26,320
Charge!

513
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:29,070
Hold!

514
00:46:32,455 --> 00:46:33,970
Hold!

515
00:46:38,944 --> 00:46:41,039
Fire!

516
00:47:15,745 --> 00:47:17,280
Retreat!

517
00:47:17,305 --> 00:47:18,999
They're pulling back!

518
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:54,970
Tend to the wounded!

519
00:47:54,995 --> 00:47:57,039
Oui! Tout suite! Tout suite!

520
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:06,510
Re-load the arms.
Yes, comrade.

521
00:48:10,355 --> 00:48:12,869
Let's get that flag back up!

522
00:48:12,894 --> 00:48:14,400
I can do that.

523
00:48:15,505 --> 00:48:17,999
No, no. That's no job
for an old man.

524
00:48:18,024 --> 00:48:19,970
I said I'll do it!

525
00:48:41,175 --> 00:48:46,200
Long live the revolution!

526
00:48:46,355 --> 00:48:48,760
Vive la Revolution!

527
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:57,080
Long live the Republic...!

528
00:49:18,465 --> 00:49:19,999
Monsieur Mabeuf!

529
00:49:25,305 --> 00:49:26,560
Grantaire.

530
00:49:29,665 --> 00:49:31,360
Monsieur?

531
00:49:32,665 --> 00:49:34,119
Monsieur?

532
00:49:34,144 --> 00:49:35,840
Take him inside.

533
00:50:32,995 --> 00:50:34,520
Come on!

534
00:50:46,105 --> 00:50:48,360
We need more weapons!

535
00:50:48,385 --> 00:50:49,799
More weapons!

536
00:51:38,944 --> 00:51:40,560
Give me that torch!

537
00:51:42,435 --> 00:51:44,240
Move!

538
00:51:46,185 --> 00:51:49,210
Move back, or I'll
blow up the barricade!

539
00:51:51,265 --> 00:51:53,999
Oh, yes? And yourself with it?

540
00:51:56,185 --> 00:51:57,770
Myself too!

541
00:52:05,305 --> 00:52:07,080
You don't believe me?

542
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,970
My God, man. You're crazy!

543
00:52:17,995 --> 00:52:19,360
Move!

544
00:52:21,185 --> 00:52:22,720
Move!

545
00:52:22,745 --> 00:52:25,210
He's crazy! Get back, get back!

546
00:52:39,914 --> 00:52:41,740
Move!

547
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:50,570
Well done.

548
00:52:50,595 --> 00:52:52,330
I didn't know you
had it in you.

549
00:52:52,355 --> 00:52:55,460
It's easy enough when you
don't care about your life.

550
00:53:06,124 --> 00:53:07,740
Watch out!

551
00:53:24,765 --> 00:53:27,410
You see, some of us still
value your life, Pontmercy...

552
00:53:28,685 --> 00:53:30,180
...even if you don't.

553
00:53:35,044 --> 00:53:36,410
Monsieur.

554
00:53:38,635 --> 00:53:40,260
At your feet.

555
00:53:46,235 --> 00:53:47,660
Eponine.

556
00:53:49,635 --> 00:53:51,099
What are you doing here?

557
00:53:57,435 --> 00:53:59,300
The soldier was shooting at you.

558
00:53:59,325 --> 00:54:01,490
I tried to stop him.

559
00:54:05,924 --> 00:54:08,330
Don't move me.
Stay with me, please.

560
00:54:14,565 --> 00:54:17,570
Listen.
I don't want to deceive you.

561
00:54:17,595 --> 00:54:19,769
I got a letter for you.

562
00:54:21,205 --> 00:54:23,660
I didn't want you to get it,
but now...

563
00:54:33,235 --> 00:54:35,260
Have you got it?

564
00:54:35,285 --> 00:54:36,570
Yes.

565
00:54:39,845 --> 00:54:41,570
Will you promise me...

566
00:54:43,124 --> 00:54:45,380
...to kiss me on the forehead
when I'm dead?

567
00:54:46,955 --> 00:54:48,820
I will feel it.

568
00:54:53,355 --> 00:54:54,769
Don't be sad.

569
00:54:55,874 --> 00:54:57,620
We're all going to die.

570
00:55:01,075 --> 00:55:02,899
Oh...

571
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,490
It's coming back.

572
00:55:06,124 --> 00:55:07,820
I can't breathe.

573
00:55:24,515 --> 00:55:26,620
I really did love you.

574
00:55:53,845 --> 00:55:55,340
Pontmercy.

575
00:56:37,924 --> 00:56:39,979
"My beloved Marius.

576
00:56:40,004 --> 00:56:42,460
"We go to Rue de I'Homme-Arme,
number 7.

577
00:56:42,485 --> 00:56:44,620
"Please come or send word
tonight. I love you.

578
00:56:44,645 --> 00:56:46,290
"I love you.

579
00:56:46,315 --> 00:56:47,769
"I love you."

580
00:56:51,924 --> 00:56:53,620
She's gone.

581
00:56:57,124 --> 00:56:59,099
In her heart, she's gone.

582
00:57:27,595 --> 00:57:29,979
Bonsoir, Monsieur.
Got a letter for number seven.

583
00:57:32,124 --> 00:57:33,380
Give it here.

584
00:57:33,405 --> 00:57:35,060
This is for a young lady.

585
00:57:35,085 --> 00:57:37,130
Mademoiselle Cosette?

586
00:57:37,155 --> 00:57:38,700
That's the one.

587
00:57:40,155 --> 00:57:42,649
Where have you come from?
The barricade.

588
00:57:42,674 --> 00:57:44,670
Rue de la Chanvrerie.

589
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:46,779
Lot of dead men there, comrade.

590
00:57:47,924 --> 00:57:51,140
Not the one who wrote that letter?
Still alive when I last saw him.

591
00:57:51,165 --> 00:57:52,620
Was he?

592
00:57:54,235 --> 00:57:56,340
Hey!

593
00:57:56,365 --> 00:57:57,570
Hi -

594
00:57:57,595 --> 00:57:59,060
Hop it!

595
00:57:59,085 --> 00:58:01,779
All right, keep your hair on!
I'm off!

596
00:58:04,004 --> 00:58:07,820
"My darling, I hastened to you.
But you were no longer there.

597
00:58:07,845 --> 00:58:10,060
"I thought I'd lost you forever.

598
00:58:10,085 --> 00:58:13,029
"I am now on the barricades
with my friends.

599
00:58:13,054 --> 00:58:15,490
"If I die, I die loving you.

600
00:58:15,515 --> 00:58:17,210
"But if I live,

601
00:58:17,235 --> 00:58:20,029
"I will find you and we'll
be together for eternity.

602
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:28,180
"When you read this,

603
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:32,060
"my soul will be nearer
to you and you'll smile.

604
00:58:33,415 --> 00:58:35,029
"I love you.

605
00:58:37,235 --> 00:58:38,700
"Marius."
