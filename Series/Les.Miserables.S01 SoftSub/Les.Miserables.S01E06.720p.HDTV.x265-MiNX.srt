1
00:00:03,913 --> 00:00:08,205
A man called Thenardier saved my life.

2
00:00:08,206 --> 00:00:10,899
If you meet him, do the best you can.

3
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:13,480
All we need now is a spark
to set off the powder keg,

4
00:00:13,505 --> 00:00:16,104
and all Paris could go up in flames!

5
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:18,984
We must make this city ungovernable!

6
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,904
And defend this barricade to the death!

7
00:00:25,585 --> 00:00:30,944
I want that man found,
arrested and brought to justice.

8
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:31,984
Where is he?!

9
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:33,944
- Who?
- Jean Valjean.

10
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:36,184
We're moving to a secret address.

11
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:38,744
But how would anyone know how to find us?

12
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:40,864
Is there someone you wish to be found by?

13
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:45,104
My beloved Marius,
please come or send word tonight.

14
00:00:45,105 --> 00:00:46,625
I got a letter for you.

15
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:48,984
Let me go!

16
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:51,785
I can't let you go!
There's fighting all over Paris!

17
00:00:53,265 --> 00:00:54,584
I hate you!

18
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:56,104
In her heart, she's gone.

19
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:58,904
Got a letter for number seven.

20
00:00:58,905 --> 00:01:01,744
My darling, I am now
on the barricades with my friends...

21
00:01:04,345 --> 00:01:07,265
If I die, I die loving you.

22
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:32,305
Attention!

23
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:10,304
So, what did you see?

24
00:03:10,305 --> 00:03:11,665
It's all over, comrade.

25
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,904
Hundreds of soldiers
are getting ready to attack.

26
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,105
And most of the barricades
have been destroyed.

27
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:29,784
Are you all right?

28
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:31,144
Me?

29
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:32,985
Never better.

30
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:40,224
Everybody outside, now.
You need to hear this.

31
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:42,465
Marius. Courfeyrac.

32
00:03:45,865 --> 00:03:47,065
Wake up!

33
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:50,385
For God's sake!

34
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:57,865
Citizens!

35
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:03,584
This... is the endgame.

36
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,665
Every man and woman who stays here
and fights today will die.

37
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:15,864
History will remember us and one day
the people will prevail.

38
00:04:15,865 --> 00:04:18,304
But, for now, the whole Paris army is out

39
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:20,624
and within an hour they will be upon us.

40
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,985
You have nothing to expect.

41
00:04:23,505 --> 00:04:24,585
Nothing to hope for.

42
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:26,945
So be it!

43
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:32,544
Let's raise the barrier higher,
and fight till the last man!

44
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:36,664
Friends, consider!

45
00:04:36,665 --> 00:04:40,984
Some of you have wives, husbands,
sons, daughters.

46
00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:42,504
Think of them.

47
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:44,384
A heroic death will do nothing for them.

48
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:46,904
You get yourself killed, they starve.

49
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:48,025
Or worse.

50
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:54,784
For you, it is a braver thing
to live, for your family's sake!

51
00:04:54,785 --> 00:04:56,504
Enjolras is right!

52
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,945
There's no shame on you
living to fight another day.

53
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:05,024
Every married man and woman,
every breadwinner, come forward,

54
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:06,625
shake our hands, and leave!

55
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:10,025
I command you!

56
00:05:11,505 --> 00:05:12,865
I entreat you!

57
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,385
Comrade.

58
00:05:56,305 --> 00:05:57,585
Live well, comrade.

59
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:00,745
You'll be building a better world.

60
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:07,345
A world we won't be seeing.

61
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:10,545
Are you quite sure you want to be here?

62
00:06:13,985 --> 00:06:15,025
Yes.

63
00:06:40,105 --> 00:06:41,145
Papa?

64
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:54,104
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

65
00:06:54,105 --> 00:06:55,224
Have you seen Papa?

66
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:56,265
No.

67
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:19,625
Mademoiselle, come back!
Mademoiselle, come back!

68
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:24,425
Prepare yourselves.

69
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:37,264
Mademoiselle! Mademoiselle!

70
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:39,144
- Get back! Get back!
- Marius!

71
00:07:39,145 --> 00:07:41,144
- Get back off the street!
- Marius!

72
00:07:41,145 --> 00:07:42,425
Marius!

73
00:07:49,545 --> 00:07:51,544
Look! Positions!

74
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:52,865
Prepare yourselves!

75
00:08:03,705 --> 00:08:05,264
Brace yourselves!

76
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:06,624
Cannon fire!

77
00:08:10,785 --> 00:08:12,065
Fire!

78
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,665
Get down!

79
00:08:37,065 --> 00:08:38,265
Stay down!

80
00:09:02,145 --> 00:09:03,945
Move! Move!

81
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:13,985
Allez! Allez!

82
00:09:22,185 --> 00:09:23,224
Fall back!

83
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:24,664
They're falling back!

84
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:39,945
Citizen, the Republic thanks you.

85
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:46,424
I don't know who you are,
or why you are here,

86
00:09:46,425 --> 00:09:47,865
but I'm glad to have you with us.

87
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:06,945
Comrades!

88
00:10:08,185 --> 00:10:11,424
This is a grim moment in our history...

89
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:14,184
...but a glorious one!

90
00:10:14,185 --> 00:10:17,545
Our sacrifice is going to help
build a better world.

91
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:24,544
This barricade is made of more than
just cobblestones and bedsteads.

92
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:26,184
It is made of hopes,

93
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:29,024
of ideals,

94
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:31,584
of love of our fellow men.

95
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:35,744
We fight for the wretched of the Earth!

96
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:37,864
And if we go to our deaths,

97
00:10:37,865 --> 00:10:41,624
we go to our deaths with joy!

98
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,465
Long live the Republic!

99
00:10:47,945 --> 00:10:49,865
Vive la revolution!

100
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:57,105
Marius! Marius.

101
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,544
We've bought ourselves some time.

102
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:03,384
The trouble is,
we're running out of bullets.

103
00:11:03,385 --> 00:11:05,144
Leave that to me.

104
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:07,144
Gavroche! Gavroche!

105
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:09,298
Come back here!

106
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:13,825
Gavroche, come back!

107
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:16,784
Gavroche!

108
00:11:16,785 --> 00:11:19,224
You'll get yourself killed.

109
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:21,265
Hey! The corpses!

110
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:23,745
Gavroche!

111
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:26,705
Bad luck, try again.

112
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:56,025
Gavroche!

113
00:12:09,585 --> 00:12:10,985
Good shot...

114
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:16,825
Don't be a fool!

115
00:12:24,105 --> 00:12:25,385
Quickly, Marius!

116
00:12:26,665 --> 00:12:28,065
Come on...

117
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:03,545
We got them.

118
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:09,105
It was good sport...

119
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:12,185
...wasn't it?

120
00:13:24,665 --> 00:13:26,185
Poor little squirt.

121
00:13:27,985 --> 00:13:29,505
What did he say?

122
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,944
He said...

123
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,625
He said it was good sport.

124
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:39,545
And...

125
00:13:41,065 --> 00:13:43,024
Enjolras!

126
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:44,575
- Get him inside, quickly.
- Get him up.

127
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,864
Dress his wound.

128
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:48,385
Come here. Come on.

129
00:14:19,945 --> 00:14:21,744
Marius. Marius!

130
00:14:21,745 --> 00:14:23,184
Open your eyes.

131
00:14:23,985 --> 00:14:25,825
This is our last refuge.

132
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:30,385
When they take the barricade,
those left alive can fight on here.

133
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,424
What about him?

134
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:35,665
The police spy?

135
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:42,665
The last man alive
can put a bullet in his head.

136
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:59,464
May I claim that honour? As a favour?

137
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,545
I don't see why not.

138
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,024
He's yours.

139
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:08,824
Fire!

140
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:18,305
Come on, comrades. Go.

141
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,625
Just so.

142
00:15:32,505 --> 00:15:34,544
Go on, then.

143
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:36,024
Take your revenge.

144
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:51,664
Oh, yeah.

145
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:53,505
A blade would be more your style.

146
00:15:55,265 --> 00:15:56,505
Aaaargh!

147
00:15:57,865 --> 00:15:59,304
Shut your mouth.

148
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:08,184
There.

149
00:16:08,185 --> 00:16:09,864
You're free. Now go.

150
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:18,424
What is this?

151
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:21,905
If I come through this alive,
which isn't very likely...

152
00:16:23,225 --> 00:16:26,624
...you can find me
at Rue de I'Homme-Arme.

153
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,144
Number seven.

154
00:16:28,145 --> 00:16:30,305
- I shan't resist arrest.
- What are you doing?

155
00:16:33,145 --> 00:16:35,864
I've no reason to take your life.
Now go, before I change my mind.

156
00:16:35,865 --> 00:16:37,571
What, you're not going to
take your opportunity?

157
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:38,969
Do you wish to die?

158
00:16:41,225 --> 00:16:45,104
It would make a hell of
a lot more sense than this.

159
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:48,345
Yeah, well, you'll have to
arrange it yourself. Now go. Go.

160
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:51,185
Just go!

161
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:08,105
Get back! Get back!

162
00:18:13,705 --> 00:18:14,945
Get back!

163
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:34,505
Courfeyrac!

164
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:37,825
Come on, come on...

165
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:25,385
This is history. This is history.

166
00:19:37,585 --> 00:19:39,545
Come on!

167
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:55,065
What the hell's going on?

168
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:26,625
Hey! Find your own boozer!

169
00:20:28,105 --> 00:20:30,545
Oh... Bugger, that hurt!

170
00:20:41,265 --> 00:20:43,345
He's the leader.

171
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:48,705
- Shoot him where he stands.
- Wait a minute!

172
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:53,105
Me too.

173
00:20:58,065 --> 00:21:00,105
Long live the Republic.

174
00:21:01,945 --> 00:21:03,305
Line up, lads.

175
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,984
You're entitled to be blindfolded.

176
00:21:07,985 --> 00:21:10,985
- Do you want the blindfold?
- I piss on your blindfold.

177
00:21:13,945 --> 00:21:15,065
Take aim.

178
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:22,465
Fire!

179
00:23:13,265 --> 00:23:15,145
24601.

180
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:20,904
This man is a criminal,
a liar and a thief.

181
00:23:20,905 --> 00:23:22,344
The scum of the Earth!

182
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:23,624
You're a dirty thief!

183
00:23:27,185 --> 00:23:31,504
It's all his fault.
You see this monster?! Monster!

184
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:35,504
- It's all his fault.
- ..criminal, liar and a thief...

185
00:23:35,505 --> 00:23:36,984
- Dirty thief!
- Monster!

186
00:23:36,985 --> 00:23:38,265
Scum of the Earth!

187
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:40,704
- Dirty thief!
- Scum of the Earth!

188
00:23:40,705 --> 00:23:42,465
- I hate you!
- Monster!

189
00:23:55,465 --> 00:23:58,785
Forgive me.

190
00:24:00,465 --> 00:24:02,064
Forgive me!

191
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:06,905
- Hold it there!
- Get back.

192
00:24:40,905 --> 00:24:42,345
You're back, sir.

193
00:24:47,985 --> 00:24:49,225
You all right?

194
00:24:50,465 --> 00:24:52,185
As you see, Rivette.

195
00:24:53,665 --> 00:24:55,304
Well, er...

196
00:24:55,305 --> 00:24:59,624
...there was a report that
you'd been captured by the rebels.

197
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:00,785
Yet here I am.

198
00:25:02,745 --> 00:25:06,025
Did you see him? The one
you're after, that man Valjean?

199
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:09,944
Yes, I saw him.

200
00:25:09,945 --> 00:25:12,465
What happened? Is he in custody?

201
00:25:13,865 --> 00:25:15,145
No.

202
00:25:16,705 --> 00:25:18,105
He got away?

203
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:23,985
He allowed me to get away.

204
00:25:25,505 --> 00:25:27,305
Must have a soft spot for you, sir.

205
00:25:30,105 --> 00:25:31,345
Are you mocking me?

206
00:25:35,105 --> 00:25:36,225
No, sir.

207
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:42,105
You know they were all killed,
the rebels.

208
00:25:44,705 --> 00:25:47,664
- Was his body found with the others?
- Don't know, sir.

209
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:54,145
Then he's still at large.

210
00:25:57,105 --> 00:25:59,824
And the other fella, Thenardier,

211
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:02,064
he's been sighted down by the river.

212
00:26:02,065 --> 00:26:04,744
These riots seem to have brought
all the scum to the surface.

213
00:26:04,745 --> 00:26:06,704
I was just on my way down there.

214
00:26:06,705 --> 00:26:08,065
Do you wish to come, sir?

215
00:26:11,345 --> 00:26:13,744
Got some of our best men
standing by, sir.

216
00:26:13,745 --> 00:26:16,057
I think there's a chance we might
net the whole gang of them.

217
00:26:16,082 --> 00:26:17,144
Good.

218
00:26:18,985 --> 00:26:20,305
Well done, Rivette.

219
00:26:25,265 --> 00:26:26,785
Just permit me, sir...

220
00:26:27,905 --> 00:26:29,785
Take your hands off me.

221
00:26:36,905 --> 00:26:38,145
Forgive me, sir.

222
00:26:41,385 --> 00:26:42,865
Beg your pardon.

223
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:14,624
It's all right...

224
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:15,865
All right.

225
00:27:19,425 --> 00:27:20,864
You're all right.

226
00:27:20,865 --> 00:27:22,705
Stay alive. Stay alive!

227
00:27:23,985 --> 00:27:25,865
Stay... Oh, God...

228
00:27:55,745 --> 00:27:58,345
Marius Pontmercy.

229
00:27:59,785 --> 00:28:01,305
So that's who you are.

230
00:28:02,985 --> 00:28:06,224
If I die, take my body to my grandfather.

231
00:28:06,225 --> 00:28:07,904
Monsieur Gillenormand,

232
00:28:07,905 --> 00:28:10,745
number six, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire...

233
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:04,424
Oh, you... you're really in the shit,
aren't you, eh?

234
00:31:04,425 --> 00:31:05,624
The shit!

235
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:09,544
Forgive me. Ooh! The smell of you, eh?

236
00:31:09,545 --> 00:31:11,944
You're really not at home here, are you?

237
00:31:11,945 --> 00:31:16,064
You don't know your way around,
it's not your milieu.

238
00:31:16,065 --> 00:31:17,264
What do you want?

239
00:31:17,265 --> 00:31:20,464
Oh, I'm just wondering about
what you're going to do now.

240
00:31:20,465 --> 00:31:22,025
How you're going to get out there.

241
00:31:22,985 --> 00:31:24,944
You don't know, do you?

242
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:26,344
You're stuck.

243
00:31:27,265 --> 00:31:29,065
Ah, shame.

244
00:31:32,345 --> 00:31:36,065
We've not been friends in the past,
have we? But I could help you now.

245
00:31:37,265 --> 00:31:41,624
You give me half of what you've
found in that man's pockets,

246
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:43,585
and I'll open up the gate for you.

247
00:31:45,705 --> 00:31:47,584
What makes you think...

248
00:31:47,585 --> 00:31:49,464
...he had anything in his pockets?

249
00:31:49,465 --> 00:31:50,733
Well, you wouldn't have killed him

250
00:31:50,734 --> 00:31:53,864
unless he had something
worth having, now, would you?

251
00:31:53,865 --> 00:31:55,865
What do you say, 50/50?

252
00:31:57,745 --> 00:31:59,145
All right.

253
00:32:00,865 --> 00:32:02,664
Are you going to get this gate open?

254
00:32:02,665 --> 00:32:05,064
Ah, no need to worry about that.

255
00:32:05,065 --> 00:32:08,504
This is my territory down here, yeah?

256
00:32:08,505 --> 00:32:09,825
Now let's see what you've got.

257
00:32:10,905 --> 00:32:13,064
Come on. Let's trade.

258
00:32:14,705 --> 00:32:16,945
There. Ye-e-e-es!

259
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:21,184
Is that all?

260
00:32:21,185 --> 00:32:23,704
Not much for slitting a man's throat.

261
00:32:23,705 --> 00:32:24,904
That's all.

262
00:32:24,905 --> 00:32:27,104
Ten francs? Are you sure?
With your permission...

263
00:32:27,105 --> 00:32:29,025
Arms out. Arms out!

264
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:32,545
Ahhh!

265
00:32:34,545 --> 00:32:37,024
Hardly worth it these days, is it, eh?

266
00:32:37,025 --> 00:32:39,344
The robbery game.

267
00:32:39,345 --> 00:32:41,065
No-one's got nothing no more.

268
00:32:45,585 --> 00:32:48,505
All right, mister, I'll let you out.
Take your friend with you.

269
00:32:50,225 --> 00:32:51,984
Find a rope,

270
00:32:51,985 --> 00:32:53,545
tie it around a big stone...

271
00:32:54,665 --> 00:32:55,905
...when you dump him.

272
00:32:57,105 --> 00:32:58,585
You don't want him bobbing up.

273
00:33:01,185 --> 00:33:02,705
Come on!

274
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:17,305
Go on. Go on!

275
00:33:34,665 --> 00:33:36,344
Oi.

276
00:33:36,345 --> 00:33:37,705
Oi!

277
00:33:40,265 --> 00:33:41,665
You ruined my life.

278
00:33:43,465 --> 00:33:46,424
I was a respected man. I had money.

279
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:50,145
Now I live like a rat
in the shitty darkness!

280
00:34:54,905 --> 00:34:56,425
It's him.

281
00:35:03,065 --> 00:35:06,384
- It's Jean Valjean.
- Inspector Javert,

282
00:35:06,385 --> 00:35:08,504
you can take me now,

283
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:10,225
but grant me one favour.

284
00:35:11,665 --> 00:35:14,145
Help me take this man home
to his grandfather.

285
00:35:15,385 --> 00:35:17,024
Who is he?

286
00:35:17,025 --> 00:35:19,105
His name's Marius Pontmercy.

287
00:35:20,545 --> 00:35:21,944
He's wounded.

288
00:35:22,545 --> 00:35:24,625
- He looks dead.
- No, not yet.

289
00:35:25,945 --> 00:35:27,465
Not yet.

290
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:31,425
Will you help me?

291
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:36,865
Please?

292
00:36:52,705 --> 00:36:54,984
Monsieur Gillenormand!

293
00:36:54,985 --> 00:36:58,384
Open up. Police! Open up!

294
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:01,305
Tell your master we've brought
his grandson's body home.

295
00:37:02,585 --> 00:37:04,065
His grandson, you say?

296
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:13,624
Oh, my God, it's Monsieur Marius.

297
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:14,905
Gently! Careful.

298
00:37:16,665 --> 00:37:18,504
It's Monsieur Marius!

299
00:37:18,505 --> 00:37:19,945
Gently, gently. Careful.

300
00:37:26,785 --> 00:37:28,225
Merci, monsieur.

301
00:37:37,185 --> 00:37:38,704
Oh, oh...

302
00:37:38,705 --> 00:37:41,664
Monsieur Marius,
what have they done to you?

303
00:37:41,665 --> 00:37:46,264
Ahhhh, no need to tell me...
He's dead! He's dead!

304
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:51,545
He's got himself killed
on the barricades, just to defy me.

305
00:37:52,825 --> 00:37:55,184
He knew very well I was waiting for him!

306
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:57,824
You... you had to do it, didn't you,

307
00:37:57,825 --> 00:38:01,184
you had to break an old man's heart...

308
00:38:07,105 --> 00:38:10,864
Wait! Monsieur! I can feel a pulse.

309
00:38:10,865 --> 00:38:12,864
Pray God he'll live!

310
00:38:12,865 --> 00:38:15,904
Serge! Serge! Quickly, get him upstairs.

311
00:38:15,905 --> 00:38:19,265
Come on! Come on! Quickly! Quickly.

312
00:38:20,745 --> 00:38:22,185
Hurry.

313
00:38:31,025 --> 00:38:32,385
One more favour.

314
00:38:38,105 --> 00:38:39,505
Let me go home.

315
00:38:40,865 --> 00:38:42,185
Just for a few minutes.

316
00:38:44,385 --> 00:38:46,545
Then you can do with me what you want.

317
00:38:58,025 --> 00:38:59,065
Granted.

318
00:39:04,865 --> 00:39:06,385
That young man.

319
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:09,465
Is he a...

320
00:39:10,505 --> 00:39:12,545
...particular friend of yours?

321
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:18,425
Would you say he's... dear to you?

322
00:39:21,585 --> 00:39:23,105
Quite the contrary.

323
00:39:24,585 --> 00:39:26,545
If he lives, he intends to...

324
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:33,104
...rob me of... all my happiness.

325
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:34,545
And yet you...

326
00:39:45,065 --> 00:39:46,505
Are you insane?

327
00:39:48,905 --> 00:39:50,425
No, I don't think so.

328
00:39:55,705 --> 00:39:57,225
Are you?

329
00:40:18,065 --> 00:40:19,105
Go in.

330
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:21,665
I'll wait for you here.

331
00:40:23,145 --> 00:40:24,745
You trust me?

332
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,545
Go in.

333
00:41:18,265 --> 00:41:19,905
Forgive me.

334
00:41:30,665 --> 00:41:32,425
Now you can find him.

335
00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:02,425
Javert?

336
00:42:06,305 --> 00:42:08,105
Javert?!

337
00:42:12,945 --> 00:42:15,145
Javert?!

338
00:43:07,105 --> 00:43:08,585
Yes, sir?

339
00:43:09,865 --> 00:43:11,704
I've been making some recommendations

340
00:43:11,705 --> 00:43:13,904
for the more efficient running
of the service.

341
00:43:13,905 --> 00:43:16,024
I entrust you with the task
of bringing them

342
00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:17,544
to the attention of the commissioners.

343
00:43:18,185 --> 00:43:19,425
Very good, sir.

344
00:43:23,505 --> 00:43:24,584
All well?

345
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:26,464
No.

346
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:28,985
Rivette...

347
00:43:33,505 --> 00:43:34,945
...all is not well.

348
00:43:36,465 --> 00:43:37,945
Prisoner Valjean.

349
00:43:40,425 --> 00:43:41,785
He's no longer a prisoner.

350
00:43:45,825 --> 00:43:47,544
I, er...

351
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,945
I let him go free.

352
00:43:56,145 --> 00:43:58,344
May I ask why, sir?

353
00:43:58,345 --> 00:43:59,505
I don't know.

354
00:44:04,025 --> 00:44:05,784
As an act of clemency?

355
00:44:05,785 --> 00:44:07,465
An act of madness.

356
00:44:16,105 --> 00:44:17,465
That man...

357
00:44:21,345 --> 00:44:22,905
That man!

358
00:44:32,505 --> 00:44:34,825
Everything I've ever believed to be true.

359
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,425
Everything I lived my life by...

360
00:44:43,865 --> 00:44:45,185
And he...

361
00:44:49,025 --> 00:44:50,505
He...

362
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:04,945
No matter.

363
00:45:11,665 --> 00:45:14,464
I shall, of course,
be resigning my commission.

364
00:45:14,465 --> 00:45:16,905
Really, sir, one mistake...

365
00:45:18,065 --> 00:45:22,424
If it is indeed a mistake, one
mistake against... a long career...

366
00:45:22,425 --> 00:45:26,384
How can I continue? After this?

367
00:45:26,385 --> 00:45:28,277
I have brought myself

368
00:45:28,302 --> 00:45:32,129
and the police service into
disgrace and disrepute.

369
00:45:35,825 --> 00:45:37,105
I need some fresh air.

370
00:45:43,865 --> 00:45:45,505
I'm going for a walk.

371
00:45:47,505 --> 00:45:51,225
Remember to bring those notes to the
attention of the Prefect Of Police.

372
00:45:56,105 --> 00:45:58,225
Goodnight, Rivette.

373
00:46:11,785 --> 00:46:13,824
I beg, Monsieur Le Prefet,

374
00:46:13,825 --> 00:46:17,624
to consider these proposals
for improvements to the service.

375
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:20,424
First, that we end the practice
of prisoners

376
00:46:20,425 --> 00:46:23,984
returning from interrogations
being made to remove their shoes

377
00:46:23,985 --> 00:46:26,904
while they await transport
back to the prison.

378
00:46:26,905 --> 00:46:30,144
Many are coughing
when they return to their cells.

379
00:46:30,145 --> 00:46:32,744
This leads to hospital experiences.

380
00:46:32,745 --> 00:46:36,304
Second, a prisoner who drops
a thread in the weaving room

381
00:46:36,305 --> 00:46:39,224
loses 10 sous. This is an abuse of...

382
00:46:39,225 --> 00:46:43,024
Third, special regulation of the...

383
00:46:43,025 --> 00:46:46,904
Fourth, surveillance is generally...

384
00:46:46,905 --> 00:46:48,585
Fifth, gendarmes...

385
00:46:52,345 --> 00:46:54,985
Prisoners coming back from the...

386
00:48:55,705 --> 00:48:57,585
Yah!

387
00:49:00,345 --> 00:49:01,585
Argh!

388
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,465
Vive la revolution!

389
00:49:14,145 --> 00:49:15,945
Ssh, Marius...

390
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:45,145
Oh, my!

391
00:49:46,305 --> 00:49:47,745
My dear boy...

392
00:49:56,025 --> 00:49:58,264
How did I end up here?

393
00:49:58,265 --> 00:50:00,345
You were carried here by the police.

394
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:02,825
Not the police.

395
00:50:06,145 --> 00:50:08,665
Somebody else. At the barricade.

396
00:50:14,665 --> 00:50:16,025
I owe him my life.

397
00:50:26,185 --> 00:50:27,505
Are they all dead?

398
00:50:30,465 --> 00:50:34,585
Enjolras, Courfeyrac,
Grantaire, all my friends.

399
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:37,185
It... would seem so.

400
00:50:44,505 --> 00:50:46,025
Was it all for nothing?

401
00:50:50,345 --> 00:50:54,465
It brought you back to me,
my dearest boy.

402
00:51:04,345 --> 00:51:06,024
I want to get married.

403
00:51:06,025 --> 00:51:08,464
Do you indeed?

404
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:12,344
Did you hear that?
He wants to be married now!

405
00:51:16,225 --> 00:51:17,785
All arranged.

406
00:51:20,105 --> 00:51:22,104
What do you mean?

407
00:51:22,105 --> 00:51:26,624
What I say. You shall have
your little sweetheart.

408
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:31,344
I've done some investigating,
and I find she's a jewel.

409
00:51:31,345 --> 00:51:35,824
And she adores you.
So, no more to be said.

410
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:37,544
Cosette agreed.

411
00:51:37,545 --> 00:51:39,585
Love agreed.

412
00:51:43,425 --> 00:51:46,705
I couldn't... be happier.

413
00:51:48,145 --> 00:51:49,465
My beloved child.

414
00:51:55,064 --> 00:51:56,465
Father...

415
00:52:01,545 --> 00:52:04,905
Did you hear that? "Father"!

416
00:52:06,425 --> 00:52:08,384
Well, he loves me after all.

417
00:52:08,385 --> 00:52:10,864
Now he's getting the girl he wants!

418
00:52:11,505 --> 00:52:14,665
Well, why not?

419
00:52:25,865 --> 00:52:27,732
- Ah, come in, monsieur.
- Marius!

420
00:52:27,757 --> 00:52:30,144
You're very welcome.

421
00:52:30,145 --> 00:52:32,169
- Cosette...
- Please, please, take a seat.

422
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:33,185
Thank you.

423
00:52:33,186 --> 00:52:34,464
What happened to you?

424
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:40,184
It doesn't matter. Someone, I don't
know who, brought me back to you.

425
00:52:40,185 --> 00:52:43,784
You're very lucky, my boy.
If I were 15 years younger,

426
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:46,705
we'd be drawing swords
to see which of us would have her!

427
00:52:48,025 --> 00:52:50,224
Really, Father!

428
00:52:50,225 --> 00:52:53,184
What's the matter?
Can't I be in love with her too?

429
00:52:53,185 --> 00:52:54,584
It's only natural.

430
00:52:54,585 --> 00:52:57,544
I'm joking, Mademoiselle. He's all yours.

431
00:52:57,545 --> 00:53:00,704
You have a handsome husband
worth his salt.

432
00:53:00,705 --> 00:53:02,664
No matter about money.

433
00:53:02,665 --> 00:53:06,264
Your grandpapa will take care
of the pair of you.

434
00:53:06,265 --> 00:53:10,224
No, my daughter has... has a dowry.

435
00:53:10,225 --> 00:53:12,104
650,000 francs.

436
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:16,905
- 650,000 francs?!
- It's all there.

437
00:53:19,025 --> 00:53:22,224
Well, you lucky devil!

438
00:53:22,225 --> 00:53:25,544
Your little dove
turns out to be a millionairess!

439
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:32,024
They don't care, monsieur.
The only care about each other.

440
00:53:32,025 --> 00:53:35,504
Ah, what it is to be young!

441
00:53:35,505 --> 00:53:38,784
Well, I'll... take my leave, monsieur.

442
00:53:38,785 --> 00:53:44,424
No, no, no. I won't hear of it.
We're all one happy family now.

443
00:53:44,425 --> 00:53:47,904
- Stay for dinner.
- No, monsieur, thank you.

444
00:53:47,905 --> 00:53:50,225
But with your permission,
I'll take my leave.

445
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:55,064
I'll see you later, Cosette.
No need for you to come now.

446
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,905
Very well, Papa. I'll see you later.

447
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:00,665
Thank you.

448
00:54:50,465 --> 00:54:52,185
What can I do for you, monsieur?

449
00:54:54,745 --> 00:54:58,024
I'm afraid I... I have to sit down.

450
00:54:58,025 --> 00:55:00,145
I have something to tell you.

451
00:55:06,185 --> 00:55:07,705
I am an ex-convict.

452
00:55:10,225 --> 00:55:12,024
20 years in the prison hulks.

453
00:55:12,025 --> 00:55:14,424
Escaped, recaptured.

454
00:55:14,425 --> 00:55:17,904
Escaped again.
And presently I'm a wanted man.

455
00:55:19,945 --> 00:55:21,184
I'm a thief.

456
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:24,624
I stole from a bishop,
the Bishop of Digne.

457
00:55:25,425 --> 00:55:27,184
I even robbed a child.

458
00:55:27,185 --> 00:55:30,144
You, Cosette's father!

459
00:55:30,145 --> 00:55:32,064
No, I'm not her father.

460
00:55:32,065 --> 00:55:33,105
She was an orphan.

461
00:55:34,545 --> 00:55:35,585
I found her.

462
00:55:36,865 --> 00:55:39,664
I am no-one.
I'm a peasant from Faverolles.

463
00:55:39,665 --> 00:55:41,504
My first crime
was to steal a loaf of bread.

464
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,424
Do you see? I'm...

465
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:44,945
I'm a common criminal.

466
00:55:49,065 --> 00:55:50,505
I knew there was something.

467
00:55:52,705 --> 00:55:54,984
I remember, at the tavern.

468
00:55:54,985 --> 00:55:56,545
You shot that police officer.

469
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:01,105
Is that why you came
to the barricade, to kill him?

470
00:56:05,225 --> 00:56:07,384
What if I told you
I came to the barricades

471
00:56:07,385 --> 00:56:08,865
with half a mind to kill you?

472
00:56:15,185 --> 00:56:17,184
Yes, you see,
that's what you're dealing with.

473
00:56:17,185 --> 00:56:19,224
For God's sake.

474
00:56:19,225 --> 00:56:20,904
What am I to think of you now?

475
00:56:20,905 --> 00:56:22,705
Think of me as you wish.

476
00:56:24,985 --> 00:56:26,664
I wanted you to know the truth

477
00:56:26,665 --> 00:56:31,064
so that I could take my leave
of her, and you, in peace.

478
00:56:33,985 --> 00:56:36,584
I don't belong in the family of men,
monsieur.

479
00:56:39,225 --> 00:56:41,184
I'm on the outside.

480
00:56:41,185 --> 00:56:42,824
Poor Cosette! When she finds out...

481
00:56:42,825 --> 00:56:46,584
No, I beg you, monsieur,
I beg you. Spare her that.

482
00:56:46,585 --> 00:56:48,984
You can't ask me to keep this from her!

483
00:56:48,985 --> 00:56:50,025
Monsieur...

484
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,465
...one day, when she was with me...

485
00:56:56,465 --> 00:56:58,585
...she saw the chain gang go by.

486
00:57:02,345 --> 00:57:04,384
And she couldn't bear to think...

487
00:57:05,985 --> 00:57:08,184
...that such wicked men existed.

488
00:57:10,545 --> 00:57:11,705
Men like me.

489
00:57:14,105 --> 00:57:16,344
If you keep my secret, I promise,

490
00:57:16,345 --> 00:57:19,505
that after the wedding I shall
get out of your lives forever.

491
00:57:29,305 --> 00:57:30,664
Agreed.

492
00:57:31,225 --> 00:57:32,585
Thank you, monsieur.

493
00:57:39,385 --> 00:57:41,345
Good day, Baron Pontmercy.

494
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:45,438
I wish you a happy life.

495
00:58:11,465 --> 00:58:12,865
Ah, elle est jolie!

496
00:58:20,665 --> 00:58:22,944
- Papa?
- Yes, my dear?

497
00:58:24,025 --> 00:58:25,904
Are you happy?

498
00:58:25,905 --> 00:58:28,984
Course I'm happy. Happy for you.

499
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:30,705
Then why aren't you smiling?

500
00:58:34,865 --> 00:58:37,585
I'm just... I'm going to miss you.
That's all.

501
00:58:40,185 --> 00:58:42,464
Don't be silly, Papa.

502
00:58:42,465 --> 00:58:44,584
The honeymoon will be over
before we know it,

503
00:58:44,585 --> 00:58:46,824
and I'll be back in six weeks.

504
00:58:46,825 --> 00:58:50,105
And... then we will see each other
all of the time.

505
01:00:27,265 --> 01:00:30,585
- Thank you. I'm glad to be home.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

506
01:00:32,585 --> 01:00:34,784
I still think we should go
and see Papa first.

507
01:00:34,785 --> 01:00:37,344
He'll be wanting to know
all about our wedding journey.

508
01:00:37,345 --> 01:00:40,944
- Maybe later. Come on, darling.
- Nicolette!

509
01:00:40,945 --> 01:00:42,105
Madame!

510
01:00:43,785 --> 01:00:45,584
Monsieur!

511
01:00:45,585 --> 01:00:47,487
- Merci.
- Merci, monsieur.

512
01:00:47,512 --> 01:00:49,849
Oh, welcome home!

513
01:00:52,505 --> 01:00:56,624
Ah. There's a visitor to see you.
Very important, the gentleman said.

514
01:00:56,625 --> 01:01:00,025
- I put him in the drawing-room.
- Very well.

515
01:01:02,745 --> 01:01:03,785
Oh.

516
01:01:05,265 --> 01:01:07,265
Bonjour, Monsieur Le Baron.

517
01:01:15,545 --> 01:01:17,544
What are you doing here?

518
01:01:17,545 --> 01:01:21,064
Monsieur, I just thought
I'd congratulate you

519
01:01:21,065 --> 01:01:22,984
on your wedding day.

520
01:01:22,985 --> 01:01:25,944
And, Madame, you look so beautiful.

521
01:01:25,945 --> 01:01:29,344
But I remember when you were
a skinny little guttersnipe

522
01:01:29,345 --> 01:01:31,145
we picked up at Montfermeil.

523
01:01:32,505 --> 01:01:34,545
Thenardier.

524
01:01:35,905 --> 01:01:37,025
That's me.

525
01:01:39,025 --> 01:01:40,944
Marius, this man is evil.

526
01:01:40,945 --> 01:01:43,744
My father saved me from him
when I was a little girl.

527
01:01:43,745 --> 01:01:45,704
Your father...

528
01:01:45,705 --> 01:01:47,784
Let me tell you something
about your father.

529
01:01:47,785 --> 01:01:49,666
Cosette, go upstairs,
I'll deal with this.

530
01:01:49,691 --> 01:01:51,384
What do you want here?

531
01:01:52,105 --> 01:01:55,585
I've got some information for you
that'll make your hair stand on end.

532
01:01:58,745 --> 01:01:59,884
What information?

533
01:01:59,909 --> 01:02:02,344
I want a little something in exchange.

534
01:02:02,345 --> 01:02:07,504
I want to set up a business.
In La Jolla. The New World.

535
01:02:07,505 --> 01:02:09,744
There's money to be made there,
slaves to trade.

536
01:02:09,745 --> 01:02:11,625
- And your information is?
- Cosette.

537
01:02:14,225 --> 01:02:17,584
That old fella, your so-called father,

538
01:02:17,585 --> 01:02:19,784
is a thief and an assassin.

539
01:02:19,785 --> 01:02:22,944
I wouldn't have him in the house
if I was you. Not safe.

540
01:02:22,945 --> 01:02:24,744
I know all this.

541
01:02:24,745 --> 01:02:25,985
He told me so himself.

542
01:02:31,865 --> 01:02:33,305
Oh, yeah?

543
01:02:35,065 --> 01:02:36,265
Who did he kill, then?

544
01:02:44,345 --> 01:02:46,144
He killed the police spy, Javert.

545
01:02:46,145 --> 01:02:47,505
I'm sorry, Cosette.

546
01:02:48,665 --> 01:02:51,744
Well, I... It's not true.

547
01:02:51,745 --> 01:02:54,344
How could you believe such a thing?

548
01:02:54,345 --> 01:02:57,064
She's right. Cos he didn't.

549
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:59,064
Javert did himself in.

550
01:02:59,065 --> 01:03:01,984
I saw it with my own eyes.
Threw himself off a bridge, he did.

551
01:03:01,985 --> 01:03:05,744
Nah, the one that the old fella
killed was a young chap.

552
01:03:05,745 --> 01:03:08,504
I met him in the sewers
just after he'd done it.

553
01:03:08,505 --> 01:03:10,785
He was going to dump the young chap
in the river.

554
01:03:17,305 --> 01:03:19,505
What did he look like, this young chap?

555
01:03:20,865 --> 01:03:24,385
About his size. I don't know.
What are you saying?

556
01:03:27,585 --> 01:03:30,224
You've got it all wrong, you old fool.

557
01:03:30,225 --> 01:03:32,024
He was saving your life!

558
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:37,705
He must have been the man
that carried you home.

559
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:49,905
He saved my life.

560
01:03:51,705 --> 01:03:53,265
He saved your life.

561
01:03:58,305 --> 01:03:59,825
What about me?!

562
01:04:01,945 --> 01:04:03,624
Eh?

563
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:05,584
- You?
- Yeah.

564
01:04:06,905 --> 01:04:09,064
You came here to ruin a man...

565
01:04:10,505 --> 01:04:13,024
...and you crowned him with glory.

566
01:04:13,025 --> 01:04:16,104
You're a liar, and a stupid one at that.

567
01:04:16,105 --> 01:04:18,784
And you're the thief,
you're the murderer.

568
01:04:20,385 --> 01:04:22,665
I saw what you did in that squalid slum.

569
01:04:24,545 --> 01:04:26,905
I could have you chained up
for the rest of your life.

570
01:04:30,345 --> 01:04:32,344
Now get out before I change my mind.

571
01:04:34,345 --> 01:04:35,385
Wait.

572
01:04:46,625 --> 01:04:47,945
Take this with you.

573
01:04:56,505 --> 01:04:57,945
1,000 francs.

574
01:05:01,025 --> 01:05:03,865
I understand you saved
my father's life at Waterloo.

575
01:05:07,905 --> 01:05:09,185
The Colonel...

576
01:05:10,665 --> 01:05:12,225
...Baron Pontmercy.

577
01:05:15,665 --> 01:05:20,504
Monsieur and Madame Pontmercy, er...

578
01:05:21,545 --> 01:05:25,065
...once in a lifetime,
virtue is rewarded, eh?

579
01:05:32,065 --> 01:05:33,505
My eternal gratitude.

580
01:05:55,945 --> 01:05:58,545
Papa? Papa!

581
01:06:00,305 --> 01:06:01,705
Cosette?

582
01:06:09,385 --> 01:06:10,705
He's gone away.

583
01:06:12,225 --> 01:06:14,344
The candlesticks -

584
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:15,505
they're gone.

585
01:06:29,305 --> 01:06:32,024
I'm sorry I kept the truth
from you, Cosette.

586
01:06:32,025 --> 01:06:33,945
I made a promise to your father.

587
01:06:35,905 --> 01:06:37,505
Marius...

588
01:06:40,425 --> 01:06:42,145
...I think I know where he might be.

589
01:07:47,705 --> 01:07:48,745
Papa?

590
01:07:50,785 --> 01:07:52,105
Papa.

591
01:08:02,905 --> 01:08:04,225
It's you.

592
01:08:07,265 --> 01:08:08,585
You've come?

593
01:08:10,505 --> 01:08:12,505
You took the candlesticks.

594
01:08:13,585 --> 01:08:16,225
I thought we might find you in Digne.

595
01:08:25,345 --> 01:08:27,665
You saved my life, and never told me.

596
01:08:28,905 --> 01:08:29,985
Oh, monsieur...

597
01:08:34,705 --> 01:08:36,505
I thought I'd never see her again.

598
01:08:38,385 --> 01:08:39,825
Cosette.

599
01:08:41,545 --> 01:08:42,905
Oh, Papa.

600
01:08:44,345 --> 01:08:46,304
Didn't you know,
I'm not worthy of your love?

601
01:08:46,305 --> 01:08:49,385
- I'm not worthy of anybody's love.
- Don't speak like that.

602
01:08:52,425 --> 01:08:53,825
I know everything.

603
01:09:01,945 --> 01:09:03,985
Why did you run away and hide?

604
01:09:06,185 --> 01:09:09,345
Oh... Oh, Papa! Papa...

605
01:09:18,705 --> 01:09:20,945
Papa, your hands, they're so cold.

606
01:09:22,265 --> 01:09:24,665
That's because I'm going to die soon.

607
01:09:29,345 --> 01:09:31,424
No.

608
01:09:31,425 --> 01:09:33,025
No, you're not.

609
01:09:34,305 --> 01:09:35,465
You won't, because...

610
01:09:37,185 --> 01:09:38,825
Because I won't let you.

611
01:09:40,465 --> 01:09:42,305
You're coming home with us.

612
01:09:44,345 --> 01:09:46,025
I'm going to kidnap you.

613
01:09:48,785 --> 01:09:50,305
Do you really love me?

614
01:09:52,465 --> 01:09:55,385
Oh, Papa. Papa.

615
01:10:21,145 --> 01:10:22,825
Are you still there?

616
01:10:24,225 --> 01:10:25,265
Yes, Papa.

617
01:10:34,625 --> 01:10:39,025
I had... things to tell you.

618
01:10:44,545 --> 01:10:45,945
Never mind.

619
01:11:00,385 --> 01:11:01,825
Thank you.

620
01:11:10,865 --> 01:11:12,465
Love each other.

621
01:12:23,785 --> 01:12:25,905
Monsieur!

622
01:12:32,865 --> 01:12:34,265
- Monsieur!
- No.

623
01:12:42,385 --> 01:12:43,865
Monsieur!
