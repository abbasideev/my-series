1
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,999
 Thank you, Sergeant.

2
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:25,534
 Oh!

3
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:30,998
 Rich pickings here.

4
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:32,998
 Let's have a look here.

5
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:54,999
 Oh! You're not dead, mon ami.

6
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:58,998
 Who won the battle?

7
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:01,998
 Erm, English. Worse luck.

8
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:04,006
 So it's all over.

9
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:08,331
For subtitling services, contatct:
waqas.zahoor89@gmail.com

10
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:12,600
 In my pocket,
you'll find a watch and a purse.

11
00:03:12,601 --> 00:03:14,332
  Oh. Take them, they're yours.

12
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,601
 Much obliged.

13
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,333
 There's nothing there.

14
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,332
 I must have been robbed.

15
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,333
 I'm sorry.

16
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,000
 They're coming. I'm off.

17
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,332
 You saved my life.

18
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,333
 Who are you?

19
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:36,134
 A Frenchman, like you, monsieur,
and if they catch me, I'll be shot.

20
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:38,332
 Your name and rank?

21
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,333
 Thenardier, sir.

22
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:41,332
 Sergeant.

23
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,268
 Sergeant.

24
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,332
 I will remember you.
and you remember me.

25
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,333
 Colonel Pontmercy.

26
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:53,332
 And if we both survive,
you can call on me, I swear it.

27
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,332
 Sh, sh, sh.

28
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,333
 Sh.

29
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:07,333
I'll get him!

30
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,332
Over there. There he goes.

31
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,333
 Colonel Baron Pontmercy
for Monsieur Gillenormand.

32
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,000
 Pontmercy? Is he still alive?

33
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:34,334
 I thought he died at Waterloo!

34
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,267
 I'll see him all right.

35
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:41,135
 I'll see him off
with a flea in his ear.

36
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,332
 You dare to come here?

37
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,333
 Good day, Father-in-law.

38
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,332
 Don't you bring
that up with me, sir!

39
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,733
 I rue the day my poor daughter
ever set eyes on you.

40
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:55,332
 And now the poor girl is dead,

41
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,332
 I thank God I need
never see you again.

42
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,333
 And yet here you are!

43
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:01,867
 I was hoping, sir, that we could...

44
00:06:01,868 --> 00:06:03,332
 make up our differences.

45
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,267
 Were you?

46
00:06:05,268 --> 00:06:07,332
 I marvel at your insolence.

47
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,332
 Make up our differences?

48
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,333
 You gave up all hope of that
when you allied your fortunes

49
00:06:11,334 --> 00:06:14,332
 with that Corsican brigand
Bonaparte!

50
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,733
 I fought for France, sir.

51
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:17,332
 Napoleon was a great man.

52
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,267
 He still has my allegiance.

53
00:06:19,268 --> 00:06:21,332
 Better not say that too loud,
young man.

54
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,332
 France has a king again, thank God.

55
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,332
 It's your lot they're
stringing up from lamp posts now.

56
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,332
 How do you like that,
now the boot's on the other foot?

57
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,332
 Huh? Bonapartist scum.

58
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,332
You're a traitor to your class!
 Sir.

59
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:39,000
 Will you at least let me spend
some time with my little boy?

60
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:41,733
 Never!
You will never set eyes on him.

61
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,332
 And I promise you this,
if you break my prohibition,

62
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,332
 I'll disinherit him.

63
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,332
 Sir, I beg you, for Marius's sake,
if not for mine.

64
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,733
 Never!

65
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:54,332
 He will be brought up
to curse your very name, Pontmercy.

66
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,332
 Now leave my house.

67
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,135
 Go on. Get out. Get out!

68
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,333
Monsieur!

69
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,600
I take the child to church
every Sunday at ten.

70
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:52,332
You can see him there.

71
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,466
 Thank you. Which-which church?

72
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:56,466
St Sulpice.

73
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:58,333
 St Sulpice.

74
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,333
 Thank you.

75
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,332
Please, Favorite!

76
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:09,134
You won't have to look after me,
I can take care of myself.

77
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:11,332
Go on! Bonjour, monsieur.

78
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,267
 Bonjour, mademoiselle.

79
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:14,332
Please!

80
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,332
No, Fantine, you're too young,
we won't let you.

81
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,332
But I'm old enough
to work with you.

82
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,332
 Come on, just let her come.

83
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,268
So what do you say?

84
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:26,333
Well...

85
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,868
..I suppose.
Oh! Thank you!

86
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:36,332
She'll be fine.

87
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,332
You can look after her if she's not.

88
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,134
 You'll have to do what we say,
all right?

89
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:43,333
Don't show me up, Fantine.
I promise I'll be good.

90
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,332
 Eh! Debout les charognes!

91
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,267
 Get back in line!

92
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,332
 Back in line, scum!

93
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,333
 Eyes forward, I said!

94
00:10:06,734 --> 00:10:09,334
 Keep on moving! Move it! Move it!

95
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,332
 Get back to work!

96
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,332
 You heard me!

97
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,332
 Pick them up I said!

98
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,332
 Come on!

99
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,332
 Pick up those buckets!

100
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,333
 Filthy dog!

101
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:20,333
 What are you looking at?

102
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:23,733
 Well, get him out from
under there!

103
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:25,332
Yes, sir, Monsieur Javert!

104
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,268
Help me!

105
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,332
 Use the ropes to get him out from
under that rock!

106
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,332
 Come on, there's four of you!

107
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,334
 And get that lot back to work!

108
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,333
 Use the ropes!

109
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:57,333
 All right, let him in.
He's going to have a go.

110
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,600
Allez! Reprenez le travaille!

111
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:22,333
Qu'est que vous regardez?
Reprenez le travaille!

112
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,333
 Unshackle 24601
and Put him in the Guard Room.

113
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,333
24601!

114
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:17,868
 Well, now, 24601.

115
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,333
 What was all that about today?

116
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,467
 You saving that guard's life.
Why?

117
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,134
 If you were trying to get yourself
an earlier release,

118
00:14:36,135 --> 00:14:38,000
 you tried in vain.

119
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:40,733
 There's no hope of that.
No hope at all.

120
00:14:40,734 --> 00:14:42,333
 Sorry to disappoint you.

121
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,333
 Is that what you hoped
to achieve by it?

122
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,333
 Your strong man act.

123
00:14:56,467 --> 00:14:59,000
 What for?

124
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:00,333
 Make a fool of me?

125
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:06,333
 I'm right, aren't I?

126
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:11,333
 Let me tell you something
that might surprise you.

127
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,333
 I could have been a criminal.

128
00:15:16,135 --> 00:15:18,332
 I was born in prison.

129
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,332
 My parents were criminals.

130
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,332
 Men like us have only two choices -
to prey upon society,

131
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,332
 or to guard it.
You chose the former.

132
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,332
 I chose the latter.

133
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,267
 And I can tell you, if I had chosen
to be a criminal, I would

134
00:15:30,268 --> 00:15:33,466
 have been a hell of a lot better one
than you've turned out to be.

135
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:37,268
 19 years for a loaf of bread!

136
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:44,268
 You've got 12 months
left to serve.

137
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:49,267
 My guess, you'll be back in here
before another year's gone by.

138
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:51,332
 And next time...

139
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,332
 it'll be for life.

140
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,333
 Whatever you think...

141
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,333
 ..you can never win.

142
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,333
 Guard!

143
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,333
 Take him back.

144
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,332
 Rich boys on the hunt.

145
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,332
 Just like us!

146
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,733
 Look at Blondie over there,
in the blue.

147
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:48,467
 He looks as if he wants
to eat you, Fantine.

148
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:51,332
I think he looks nice.

149
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:55,333
 Oh, Blondie,
it's your lucky night tonight!

150
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,332
What do you say, then, gentlemen?
Will they do?

151
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,134
I'd say they're ripe
for the plucking.

152
00:17:02,135 --> 00:17:05,000
 One or two of them have been
plucked before, I'd say.

153
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:07,600
 I like a girl who knows
her way around a man.

154
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:10,332
Then I stake my claim
to the little brunette.

155
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,332
She's ravishing.

156
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,000
And what if she prefers one of us?

157
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:15,867
To me? Impossible.

158
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,332
No, no, I'm serious, gentlemen.

159
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,268
Keep off the grass. She's mine.

160
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,333
  Don't be shy. Don't be shy!

161
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,332
 Men! You could wait forever.

162
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,135
 Come on, Fantine.

163
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,332
No, no, no. I'm afraid
we cannot permit you

164
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,332
to dance without partners.

165
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,333
 Thought you'd never ask, monsieur.

166
00:18:17,467 --> 00:18:19,332
May I ask your name, mademoiselle?

167
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:23,134
Fantine, monsieur.

168
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,467
Fantine.

169
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:29,332
 So, are we going again next week?

170
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,134
 As long as it's understood
they pay for everything,

171
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:33,332
 and bring us there and home again.

172
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,332
 Why not? Fantine?

173
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,332
Oh, yes! Of course!

174
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,333
 Look at her. She's in love already.

175
00:19:39,334 --> 00:19:41,333
No, I'm not.

176
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,333
 Come here, pet.

177
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:50,332
 You have to remember they're
not serious, these types.

178
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,267
 They're just amusing themselves.

179
00:19:52,268 --> 00:19:55,332
 They come to Paris to learn
how to be fine gentlemen,

180
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,332
 and then they go home and marry the
girl their father chose for them.

181
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,333
 Maybe it's not always like that.
Yes, it is, it's always like that.

182
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,332
 We're not like them.

183
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,134
 We're not ladies, we're grisettes.

184
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:10,332
 The ground we walk on,
it's not solid ground, Fantine.

185
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,332
 We could fall through at any time.

186
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,332
 We could be down in the gutter
and no-one would care.

187
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,332
 Plenty more where we come from.

188
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,600
But why should it
always be like that?

189
00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:19,333
 Because it is.

190
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,332
This won't do.
The seam's crooked.

191
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,333
Unpick it and do it again.

192
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,333
 Slow and steady wins the race!

193
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,332
 Come on, Felix,
put your back in to it, man!

194
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,332
Fantine, keep up!

195
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,332
Come on, Felix,
we're getting left behind.

196
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,332
 I don't care.

197
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,333
 I just want to look at you.

198
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,333
Do I look very nice, then?

199
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,867
 You look like an angel.

200
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:16,333
Favorite says I shouldn't believe
a single word you say.

201
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,333
 Of course.

202
00:21:23,135 --> 00:21:26,333
 She wants to protect you,
she's a good friend.

203
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:30,332
 But you know she has no need
to worry, Fantine.

204
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,332
 You are the one with all the power
in this situation.

205
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,332
 I'm utterly at your mercy.

206
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,733
I don't believe you.

207
00:21:36,734 --> 00:21:38,332
 Let me prove it.

208
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,332
How are you going to prove it?

209
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,601
 You'll see.

210
00:21:47,868 --> 00:21:56,332
 Before I met you, I sought nothing
but my own selfish pleasures.

211
00:21:56,333 --> 00:22:00,135
 Now I want to dedicate
my life to you.

212
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,332
 You see, I'm...

213
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,332
 I'm a poet.

214
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:10,334
 And I hope to be famous one day.

215
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,467
 And you will be my muse.

216
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,333
 I wonder if you know
how I'm suffering.

217
00:22:30,868 --> 00:22:34,332
 Are you going
to be merciful, Fantine?

218
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,333
 Will you take pity on me?

219
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,333
I don't want you to be sad.

220
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:50,333
 Then?

221
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,333
You promise you'll be good
to me, Felix?

222
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,135
 On my life.

223
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,333
All right, then.

224
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,001
 Move!

225
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,332
 What did he do?

226
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,332
He struck me, sir!

227
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,333
 All right, pull him out.

228
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,332
 On your knees, scum!

229
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,332
 All of you, get down!

230
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:14,333
 Don't look at me!
On your knees and stay there!

231
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,333
 Discipline must be maintained.

232
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,333
 Otherwise, civilisation
would collapse.

233
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,001
 Firing squad!

234
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,333
 Present arms!

235
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,332
 Take aim.

236
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:42,001
 Fire!

237
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:59,332
 To order restored now everyone
knows their place again.

238
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:02,332
 The King. The King!

239
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,333
 Good boy.

240
00:25:04,601 --> 00:25:08,332
 Napoleon was a scoundrel.

241
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:11,268
What was he?
Scoundrel.

242
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:18,334
 And your papa, I'm sorry to say,
is a scoundrel, too.

243
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:24,332
 Don't look at me like that,
I speak the truth.

244
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,332
 A traitor to his class.

245
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:29,332
 And that is why he will
never be welcome at this table.

246
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:33,466
 He should be rotting in prison,
or in exile, like his master.

247
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:35,332
 Scoundrel.

248
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,333
Scoundrel.

249
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,332
 Good boy!

250
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:42,333
 You know, Marius, it gives me
no pleasure to speak of

251
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:45,332
 your father in these terms.

252
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:50,332
 A boy should be able
to respect his father.

253
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:56,332
 Never mind, your grandpapa is here
to show you the right path in life.

254
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:58,332
 All done? Good boy.

255
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,332
 Take him away, Nicolette.

256
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:05,001
 And no more of those sullen looks,
or you'll feel the back of my hand!

257
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,332
 Come on, Marius.

258
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:14,332
 Wait, wait.
Give your Grandpapa a kiss.

259
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,333
 Good boy.

260
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:19,134
 Sleep tight.
Mind the fleas don't bite.

261
00:26:19,135 --> 00:26:21,332
 You'll be taking him to church
in the morning?

262
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,134
 Yes, monsieur.

263
00:26:23,135 --> 00:26:24,333
 Yes, good, off you go.

264
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:48,333
 There you are.

265
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:03,467
 Thank you.

266
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,332
Monsieur.

267
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,333
Monsieur.

268
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:08,333
 24601.

269
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,467
 Unshackle him.

270
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,333
 Take off your things.

271
00:28:45,135 --> 00:28:48,332
 Trousers, shirt, jacket, cap, shoes.

272
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:50,333
 Put them on.

273
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,466
What about my savings?

274
00:29:01,467 --> 00:29:03,332
171 francs.

275
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:04,467
 109.

276
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,332
171.

277
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,000
I kept a record in my head.

278
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:12,333
 A common error.

279
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:16,332
 The prisoner's calculated
the sum from the number of days

280
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:19,332
 of imprisonment,
not the number of working days.

281
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:23,000
 After deductions of days not worked,
that is to say Sundays,

282
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:28,332
 public holidays, and contributions
for the annual Christmas dinner,

283
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:32,333
 the sum comes to 109 francs.

284
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:37,333
 Spend it wisely.

285
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,867
 Here's your passport.

286
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:51,332
 You are required to show this
to authorities in every town

287
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,135
 and village you pass through.

288
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:03,333
 You have your name back,
Monsieur 24601.

289
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:06,334
 I wonder if you can
remember what it is.

290
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:11,332
Jean Valjean.

291
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:12,467
 Are you sure about that?

292
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:16,333
Jean Valjean!

293
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,734
Jean Valjean!

294
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:03,332
 Monsieur, good evening.

295
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:09,333
 She will be happy to see you,
in your magnificent trousers.

296
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:30,332
What is it, Felix?

297
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:32,332
 Oh, you know me.

298
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,333
 I get these...

299
00:31:34,868 --> 00:31:36,332
 ..silly fancies.

300
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,333
What sort of fancies?

301
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:45,332
 That one day I'll come round
and you'll tell me it's all over,

302
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:46,333
 you've found a new lover.

303
00:31:46,334 --> 00:31:48,332
I love you, silly.

304
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:51,332
 But you're far too beautiful.

305
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:54,333
Are you fishing for compliments?

306
00:31:55,467 --> 00:31:57,333
 Well, we've had our fun, haven't we?

307
00:31:58,734 --> 00:32:01,332
 I wouldn't harbour any grudges
if you abandoned me now

308
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:03,332
 for a younger lover.

309
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,333
I'll never abandon you.

310
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:08,867
You're the love of my life.

311
00:32:08,868 --> 00:32:11,333
 Youth must have its day.

312
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:15,333
I wish you'd stop talking like that.
I don't like it.

313
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,001
 All right. Change of subject.

314
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,332
 Listen.

315
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:25,332
 My friends and I have arranged
a surprise for you and your friends.

316
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:26,600
 Next Sunday.

317
00:32:26,601 --> 00:32:28,332
 A special outing, all day.

318
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,867
All day?

319
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:32,601
Oh, you're so good to us!

320
00:33:03,135 --> 00:33:04,333
Show me your papers.

321
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,268
 Come on.

322
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,333
Need another man?

323
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:19,332
 Yeah, all right.

324
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:22,333
 You look strong enough.
Get to it.

325
00:35:28,868 --> 00:35:31,333
 They got more.
That's enough for you.

326
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:49,268
 What are you doing there, my friend?

327
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:53,333
Trying to sleep,
what does it look like?

328
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:55,332
 Why don't you go to an inn?

329
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,332
I did.

330
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:58,333
Wouldn't take me.

331
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:02,135
No-one would take me.
They shut their doors against me.

332
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:07,333
 Have you tried
knocking on that door?

333
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:10,333
Which one?

334
00:37:10,334 --> 00:37:12,333
 The house with the light
in the window.

335
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:18,332
No.

336
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:20,001
 Knock there.

337
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:31,332
Have you heard what people
are saying, Monseigneur?

338
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,333
All the town's talking about it.

339
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,333
 About what?

340
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,332
The bad man that's roaming the town.

341
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:41,467
They said he was a desperado
with a terrible face.

342
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:46,332
 Well, I dare say a man
can't help his face.

343
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,134
 Come in.

344
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:05,600
 What can we do for you, my son?

345
00:38:05,601 --> 00:38:07,466
I want something to eat,
and a bed for the night.

346
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:09,332
I've got money. I can pay.

347
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:12,332
A woman told me
to knock on your door.

348
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,332
 Then you've come to the right place.

349
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:18,332
 We have a bed for you,
and we were just about to eat.

350
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:21,333
 Would you set another place
at the table, Madame Magloire?

351
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,333
 It's good?

352
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:41,733
Yeah, it's good.

353
00:38:41,734 --> 00:38:44,333
 You were very hungry, I think.

354
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:47,333
 Let me pour you some more wine.

355
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:53,333
You're a funny sort of priest.

356
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,332
We had priests in prison.

357
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,601
Not like you.

358
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:03,332
You say I don't have to
pay for any of this?

359
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:05,332
 What is mine is yours, monsieur.

360
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:07,268
I've got money.

361
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:09,466
109 francs,

362
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:12,332
and five sou.

363
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:15,268
 And how long did it take you
to earn that?

364
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,466
19 years.

365
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:21,001
 19 years.

366
00:39:23,734 --> 00:39:26,134
19 years of hard labour.

367
00:39:26,135 --> 00:39:27,600
Well, the five sou I earned today.

368
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:31,332
It should have been seven,
but he cheated me.

369
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:34,268
Yellow passport.
People take advantage.

370
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:38,332
 You have suffered a great deal,
my friend.

371
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:40,332
Chained and shackled night and day,

372
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,332
beaten for a word,
beaten for a look,

373
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:44,134
beaten for nothing!

374
00:39:44,135 --> 00:39:45,466
For 19 years.

375
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:48,333
And now the yellow passport,
so they've still got me.

376
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:52,333
But this is, er...

377
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,333
Hm.

378
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:57,333
..different.

379
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,333
This is like I'm dreaming.

380
00:40:06,268 --> 00:40:07,333
Is this a trick?

381
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:11,332
Monsieur,
the bishop treats everyone the same.

382
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:14,000
 Yes, God tells us
to love our fellow men.

383
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:17,333
How can I love my fellow man
when he treats me worse than a dog?

384
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,001
It's easy for you.

385
00:40:22,268 --> 00:40:24,333
You can afford to be
kind and gentle.

386
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:29,332
You can afford to share
your food and wine. Am I right?

387
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,332
 Yes, of course you're right.

388
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:34,332
 Absolutely right. It is easy for me.

389
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,332
 But consider this.

390
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:40,332
 Even if the world has
done you a great injustice,

391
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:46,332
 does it really serve you to have a
heart full of bitterness and hatred?

392
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:49,267
How could I not have a heart
full of bitterness and hatred?

393
00:40:49,268 --> 00:40:51,867
I'd like to see you for
19 years in the hulks!

394
00:40:51,868 --> 00:40:54,333
So don't preach to me
about God and love.

395
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:56,332
 I beg your pardon.
Forgive me.

396
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:59,333
 I should have considered
your feelings.

397
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:05,332
 But you don't think it possible,

398
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:10,333
 that kindness and love
can change a man?

399
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:20,333
No.

400
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:34,868
 This is my bedroom here.

401
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:41,333
 And this is where you'll sleep.

402
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:46,000
 Tomorrow morning,
you'll have a cup of warm milk,

403
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:48,332
 straight from our very own goat.

404
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:52,333
You give me a bed right next
to yours? Are you crazy?

405
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:56,000
How do you know I'm not a murderer?

406
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:59,332
 Well, that's the Good Lord's
business, not mine.

407
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:02,332
 Or, to put it another way,

408
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,467
 I'll take my chance with you,
my friend.

409
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:09,332
 Go to bed now, and...

410
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:10,734
 sleep well.

411
00:43:32,135 --> 00:43:34,332
Monseigneur! Monseigneur!

412
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:36,332
 What is it?

413
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:38,332
The silverware basket! It's gone!

414
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:40,733
 No, no, no, it's here!

415
00:43:40,734 --> 00:43:42,333
 Look, over there. Oh!

416
00:43:46,268 --> 00:43:47,332
What about the silverware?

417
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:51,333
 Ah. Now, there, I can't help you,
I'm afraid.

418
00:44:00,734 --> 00:44:02,333
It's been stolen!

419
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:07,332
Lord save us! That man who was here
last night, he must have taken it!

420
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:09,332
Oh...

421
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:11,333
ungrateful beast!

422
00:44:11,334 --> 00:44:14,333
After all your kindness!

423
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:17,332
 Well, when you think about it,

424
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:21,733
 was all that silver really ours
in the first place?

425
00:44:21,734 --> 00:44:24,734
Yes, it was! Of course it was!

426
00:44:26,334 --> 00:44:30,333
And, more to the point,
what are we to eat with now?

427
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:37,332
 And, really, do we need even
a wooden fork or spoon

428
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:41,333
 to dip a piece of bread
into a bowl of milk?

429
00:44:41,334 --> 00:44:44,332
But to think what might have
happened last night!

430
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:46,332
Letting a wild beast like that
into your house,

431
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,466
we're lucky all he did was steal!

432
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:52,333
 Come in.

433
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:57,333
 Monseigneur.

434
00:44:57,334 --> 00:44:59,332
 This man was arrested ten miles away

435
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:01,332
 with a quantity of silverware
in his knapsack,

436
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:04,332
 which I believe to be
the property of the church.

437
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:09,332
 Ah, thank you, Sergeant,
for bringing him back to me.

438
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:13,332
 Welcome back, I'm glad to see you.

439
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:16,333
 You forgot to take the candlesticks,
didn't you?

440
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:20,333
What?

441
00:45:20,334 --> 00:45:26,332
 Well, didn't he tell you that
I said he could have the silverware?

442
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:29,332
 He refused to answer when
questioned, Monseigneur.

443
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:31,733
 Well, that was his right.

444
00:45:31,734 --> 00:45:34,332
 But no harm done.

445
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:37,332
 Of course you were doing your duty.

446
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:41,333
 So all is well, you can go now.

447
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:45,332
 Let him go free?

448
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:47,868
 That's right.
And thank you for your trouble.

449
00:45:49,001 --> 00:45:50,333
 You may go now.

450
00:45:52,601 --> 00:45:54,332
 If you say so, Monseigneur.

451
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:56,333
 I do. Good day to you.

452
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:16,333
 Here you are.

453
00:46:16,334 --> 00:46:18,332
 Put them in your knapsack.

454
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:22,332
Monseigneur, what does this man
want with our candlesticks?

455
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:26,333
 I assume he's going to sell them
for as much as he can get.

456
00:46:29,268 --> 00:46:34,000
 Don't forget, don't ever forget,

457
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:38,333
 you promised to use the proceeds
to become an honest man.

458
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:41,332
I don't remember that.

459
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:44,332
 Nevertheless, it's what you want,
isn't it?

460
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:46,267
 To lead a good life?

461
00:46:46,268 --> 00:46:47,333
No.

462
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:53,267
I don't know.

463
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:55,333
 Jean Valjean, my brother,

464
00:46:55,334 --> 00:46:58,332
 you do not belong to evil any more.

465
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:00,868
 You belong to good.

466
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:06,000
 I have bought your soul with that
silverware and these candlesticks.

467
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:07,332
No!

468
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:10,333
 Nothing to be done about it,
I'm afraid.

469
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:16,267
 You belong to God now, Jean Valjean.

470
00:47:16,268 --> 00:47:18,332
 Go in peace.

471
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:20,135
 God be with you.

472
00:47:42,601 --> 00:47:44,333
 Well, that's that.

473
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:49,333
 I've done all I can.

474
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:53,467
 It's up to Jean Valjean now.

475
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:03,332
 # Amor me llama... #
A little higher, please!

476
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:06,333
# Toda mi alma es en mi ojos

477
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:10,332
# Porque ensenas... #

478
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:14,267
 No cheating! Come on!

479
00:48:14,268 --> 00:48:17,466
Go on! Run! Faster, faster, faster!
 Run!

480
00:48:17,467 --> 00:48:20,333
Faster, faster, faster! Come on!

481
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:24,332
We have a winner! We have a winner!

482
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:26,134
 You said there would be a surprise!

483
00:48:26,135 --> 00:48:27,332
 The surprise comes later!

484
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:29,332
So do you love me, Favorite?

485
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:31,867
Of course I do, Blachevelle,
darling!

486
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:34,332
I adore you!

487
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:37,332
So what would you do
if I stopped loving you?

488
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:40,134
Oh, no, don't say that,
even as a joke!

489
00:48:40,135 --> 00:48:43,733
I'd run after you and
scratch your eyes out.

490
00:48:46,334 --> 00:48:48,332
 What you said just then
about Blachevelle,

491
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:49,733
 you don't really mean it, do you?

492
00:48:49,734 --> 00:48:52,333
I detest him.

493
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:54,867
He's too full of himself.

494
00:48:54,868 --> 00:48:56,332
And he's stingy.

495
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:00,267
There's a boy down my street
that I'm in love with.

496
00:49:00,268 --> 00:49:02,332
Thing is,
he only makes 20 sou a day,

497
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:04,333
so... what are you going to do?

498
00:49:06,001 --> 00:49:07,867
Don't look at me like that, Fantine!

499
00:49:07,868 --> 00:49:09,867
I know you love your Felix.

500
00:49:09,868 --> 00:49:12,332
And he's not stingy,
I will give you that,

501
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:14,333
setting you up in your own place.

502
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:17,333
All done?

503
00:49:26,734 --> 00:49:28,332
Waiter! Waiter!

504
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:31,332
<font color="#ffffff">Waiter, another bottle, please!
  Two! Two!

505
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:33,466
Two more! <font color="#11FF11">Two! Two more!
 Toast, toast!

506
00:49:33,467 --> 00:49:36,332
Ladies and gentlemen!

507
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:38,333
 A little decorum, if you please!
Decorum!

508
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:42,332
 Shh! Let's bring some dignity
to the banquet.

509
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:45,332
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, leave us alone, Felix!
 Down with the tyrant!

510
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:48,333
 Bombarda, Bombance, and Bamboche!

511
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:52,332
Friends, I appeal to you!

512
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:57,867
There must be a limit, even to
a meal such as this one has been!

513
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:02,000
Gluttony punishes the glutton.

514
00:50:02,001 --> 00:50:07,267
And remember,
all our passions, even love,

515
00:50:07,268 --> 00:50:10,333
can die through over-indulgence.

516
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:13,332
Moderation is the watchword.

517
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:16,332
 Moderation in all things. Yes!
Hear, hear!

518
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:18,332
 Hear, hear! Good speech.

519
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:20,332
 Now sit down and shut up.

520
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:22,332
I haven't finished,
I haven't finished!

521
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:24,332
A toast to merriment!

522
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:26,333
 To merriment!

523
00:50:26,334 --> 00:50:29,333
Life is good!
Everything is beautiful!

524
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:34,332
I'm surrounded by beauty!

525
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:37,332
 Awww!

526
00:50:46,135 --> 00:50:48,267
That's better.

527
00:50:48,268 --> 00:50:50,867
 Now come and sit down,
and be sensible, please.

528
00:50:50,868 --> 00:50:54,000
No.  Please. the moment has come.

529
00:50:54,001 --> 00:50:57,332
It's time for the surprise!

530
00:50:58,334 --> 00:51:00,332
 Surprise! Gentlemen.

531
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:02,268
The surprise.

532
00:51:06,135 --> 00:51:07,867
 Don't be long!

533
00:51:07,868 --> 00:51:10,332
 Make it a good one.

534
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,333
This is the surprise!

535
00:51:21,334 --> 00:51:24,333
Shh! Shh!

536
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:37,332
 At last, the surprise!
What's it going to be?

537
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:39,332
 I don't know, but
I hope it's pretty.

538
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:41,332
Gold necklaces!

539
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:42,333
 No.

540
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:48,332
 What's that?
Where are the gentlemen?

541
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:51,332
The gentlemen have
left a letter for you.

542
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:52,333
 Give it here.

543
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:58,332
 It says, "This is the surprise."

544
00:51:58,333 --> 00:52:00,333
 Well, go on, then. Open it!

545
00:52:00,334 --> 00:52:02,333
 Good job one of us can read.

546
00:52:02,334 --> 00:52:05,467
 Right, here we go.

547
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,600
 "O loving mistresses!

548
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:13,466
 "At last it is time to remind you
that we have parents.

549
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:16,267
 "We have estates far away
in the country,

550
00:52:16,268 --> 00:52:18,332
 "and we have duties to perform.

551
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:22,332
 "Our fathers are calling
their prodigal sons home,

552
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:24,466
 "and killing fatted calves for us.

553
00:52:24,467 --> 00:52:27,332
 "By the time you read this,

554
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:31,332
 "three galloping horses
will be carrying us home

555
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:32,867
 "to our mamas and papas.

556
00:52:32,868 --> 00:52:34,466
 "We are leaving.

557
00:52:34,467 --> 00:52:36,333
 "We have left.

558
00:52:37,467 --> 00:52:40,332
 "Lament us briefly,

559
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:42,332
 "and replace us rapidly.

560
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:48,332
 "Signed, Felix,
Blachevelle and Fameuil.

561
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:52,467
 "PS, the meal is paid for."

562
00:54:21,334 --> 00:54:25,333
 # Que direz-vous d'Cadet Rousselle?
Ah! Ah! Ah! Oui, vraiment

563
00:54:25,334 --> 00:54:28,134
 # Cadet Rousselle est bon enfant

564
00:54:28,135 --> 00:54:32,134
 # Cadet Rousselle a trois maisons
Cadet Rousselle a trois maisons

565

Qui n'ont ni poutres ni chevrons

566
00:54:35,868 --> 00:54:38,000
 # C'est pour loger les hirondelles

567
00:54:38,001 --> 00:54:39,333
 # Que direz-vous d'Cadet Rousselle?

568
00:54:39,334 --> 00:54:41,332
 # Ah! Ah! Ah! Oui, vraiment

 # Cadet Rousselle a trois maisons. #

575
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:01,333
 Did you see my 40 sou, monsieur?

576
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:03,334
No.

577
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:11,333
 Will you move your foot, monsieur?

578
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:16,467
What's your name?

579
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:20,332
 Petit-Gervais.

580
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:21,334
 Will you move your foot now?

581
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:26,333
Go on, get out of here.

582
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:32,332
Get lost! Go on!

583
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:33,733
 You've got it, haven't you?

584
00:55:33,734 --> 00:55:35,600
 You've got my money!

585
00:55:35,601 --> 00:55:38,332
 You're a dirty thief!
A curse on you!

586
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:35,333
Petit-Gervais! Petit-Gervais!

587
00:56:41,601 --> 00:56:43,467
Petit-Gervais!

588
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:29,333
 Here's Maman!

589
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:32,332
Was she a good girl?

590
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:34,134
 Good as gold.

591
00:57:35,334 --> 00:57:38,333
 I hope you were, too, mademoiselle!

592
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:41,333
Aren't I always?

593
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:17,332
Shhh, shhh.

594
00:58:17,333 --> 00:58:19,268
Shhh.

595
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:44,332
Oh, Cosette.

596
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:47,333
Whatever are we going to do now?
