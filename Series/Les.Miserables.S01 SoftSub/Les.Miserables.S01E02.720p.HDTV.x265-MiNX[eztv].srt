1
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,923
19 years for a loaf of bread.

2
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:07,989
Aaargh!

3
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:13,894
My guess, you'll be back in here
before another year's gone by.

4
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:16,894
And next time it'll be for life.

5
00:00:16,895 --> 00:00:19,910
You can never win.

6
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:22,914
Do you promise you'll be
good to me, Felix?

7
00:00:22,915 --> 00:00:23,955
On my life.

8
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:26,914
Three galloping horses

9
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:28,954
will be carrying us home
to our mamas and papas.

10
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:30,938
We are leaving. We have left.

11
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:33,955
Oh, Cosette, whatever
are we going to do now?

12
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,894
Rich pickings here. Aargh!

13
00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:42,906
Ooh!
You saved my life. Who are you?

14
00:00:42,907 --> 00:00:43,954
Thenardier, sir.

15
00:00:43,955 --> 00:00:45,946
Jean Valjean, my brother,

16
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:49,910
I have bought your soul with that
silverware and these candlesticks.

17
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:51,938
You belong to good.

18
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:53,946
Did you see my 40 sous, monsieur?

19
00:00:53,947 --> 00:00:55,890
Get lost! Go on!

20
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:57,918
You've got my money.
You're a dirty thief!

21
00:00:57,919 --> 00:00:59,883
Petit Gervais!

22
00:01:27,883 --> 00:01:29,890
Maman, I'm tired.

23
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:30,954
Two, three…

24
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:32,931
Oh, there's a good girl.

25
00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:36,939
All right.

26
00:01:39,955 --> 00:01:41,931
Maman loves you.

27
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:44,883
Very much.

You have two lovely children

They are, though I says so,
I shouldn't.

34
00:02:48,883 --> 00:02:51,922
Eponine and Azelma.
My pride and joy, ain't you, girls?

35
00:02:51,923 --> 00:02:53,970
But you've got a lovely
little one too.

36
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:56,906
And such fine clothes.

37
00:02:56,907 --> 00:02:59,930
Do you want to come and sit down,
take the weight off your feet?

38
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:02,930
Thank you, madame. Look, your
little girl can play with mine.

00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:04,914
What's her name? Cosette.

40
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:08,445
Have you come a long way?
You look ever so tired. From Paris.

41
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,954
I'm on my way to Montreuil.

42
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:13,938
I've heard there's some good work
to be had there.

43
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:15,907
Where's hubby?

44
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:18,955
Erm…

45
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:22,930
He's… He's dead.

46
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,938
Oh, dear.

47
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,906
So you've had a hard time of it,
I dare say.

48
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,883
Yes, I have.

49
00:03:30,883 --> 00:03:33,914
But once I get into a steady job,
I'll soon be on my feet again.

50
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:35,906
Yeah, of course you will.

51
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:40,084
Still, it's not easy holding down a
job with a little one in tow, is it?

52
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:45,931
No.

53
00:03:48,883 --> 00:03:50,882
Do you keep the inn here?

54
00:03:50,883 --> 00:03:52,938
Yeah, that's right, dear.
Thenardier's the name.

55
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:55,882
See that sign there?
That's my husband.

56
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:58,930
He was the hero of Waterloo.
He saved a colonel's life.

57
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:01,959
Carried him on his back
through a hail of bullets.

58
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,907
Was your hubby a military man
at all?

59
00:04:07,883 --> 00:04:08,923
No.

60
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:11,906
A poet. Oh!

61
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:12,955
Very nice.

62
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:17,073
Not a lot of money in that though,
I shouldn't wonder.

63
00:04:21,931 --> 00:04:23,919
Oh, look at that!

64
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:27,906
Children make friends
in no time, don't they?

65
00:04:27,907 --> 00:04:28,947
Maman!

66
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,425
If you walked past that,
you'd swear they were three sisters.

67
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:46,906
Could you look after my child
for a while, madame?

68
00:04:46,907 --> 00:04:48,954
Oh… You see, you were right.

69
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,930
It's hard to get work, especially
when you have a child with you.

70
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:54,962
Yeah, especially when
you're on your own.

71
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:58,882
When I saw your little ones looking
so pretty and well cared for,

72
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,930
I knew that the good Lord
had guided me here.

73
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:02,882
Will you?

74
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:03,954
I could pay.

75
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:05,954
Six francs a month.

76
00:05:05,955 --> 00:05:07,899
Seven.

77
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:10,930
Good morning, mademoiselle.
Monsieur.

78
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:13,958
It'll have to be seven. You wouldn't
want us to skimp on her meals,

79
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,902
so that's seven francs,
six months in advance.

80
00:05:16,903 --> 00:05:19,882
I'll be back before then to
get her, I'm sure, monsieur.

81
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:22,906
In that case we'd refund you, but
those are the terms, regrettably.

82
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:25,954
We can't make any exceptions
or where would we be?

83
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:28,878
Six sevens, that's 42 francs.

84
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,903
Yeah.

85
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:36,890
And we'll have to think about
initial expenses too, of course.

86
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:38,906
Shall we say a nominal sum
of 15 francs?

87
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:40,950
15 and 42, that's 57 francs.

88
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:42,935
57?

89
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:47,931
I'll pay it.

90
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,966
You will look after her
and love her like your own?

91
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:56,950
Oh, we love her already,
don't we, Thenardier?

92
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:59,882
Of course we do. How could we not?

93
00:05:59,883 --> 00:06:01,001
Come here. Come on.

94
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:03,946
Believe me, mademoiselle,

95
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:07,930
your little darling will want
for nothing in our loving care,

96
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:09,883
yeah.

97
00:06:10,883 --> 00:06:11,931
Thank you.

98
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:21,882
Come here. Come here, little ones.
Come and play with Daddy.

99
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:25,883
Oh, look! That's a lovely cup
of tea you've got there, eh.

100
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:29,926
Cosette, now you're to be
a good girl,

101
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:32,882
and this kind lady and gentleman

102
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:34,907
will look after you for a while.

103
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:38,911
No.And Maman will be back
for you very soon.

104
00:06:39,943 --> 00:06:41,910
No, Maman.

105
00:06:41,911 --> 00:06:43,907
It's all right, my darling.

106
00:06:49,883 --> 00:06:50,951
Maman! Maman!

107
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:53,922
Maman, please!

108
00:06:53,923 --> 00:06:54,955
Maman.

109
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:58,882
Maman. I'll be back, darling.

110
00:06:58,883 --> 00:07:00,922
It's all for the best, you'll see.
Please, no!

111
00:07:00,923 --> 00:07:03,906
Can't let them have all their
own way, can we? Maman!

112
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:06,898
All right, bye, Maman. Maman!

113
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:08,882
Maman, please! Please!

114
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:09,930
Come on.

115
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,931
Maman!

116
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,001
Monsieur Madeleine.

117
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:51,882
Pere Madeleine, as he is known
by many of you,

118
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:54,883
came to Montreuil three years ago.

119
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:57,954
On the very day he arrived,

120
00:07:57,955 --> 00:08:00,966
he rushed into a burning house

121
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:04,954
and brought out two children,
saving their lives.

122
00:08:04,955 --> 00:08:07,930
He has brought new industry
to the area

123
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:11,954
and his factory has turned
the fortunes of our town around.

124
00:08:11,955 --> 00:08:15,974
We are all better off
because of Pere Madeleine.

125
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:19,955
He has been a wise
and generous employer.

126
00:08:21,883 --> 00:08:25,882
Ever reluctant to put himself
forward,

127
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:31,894
he has at last been persuaded
by the grateful citizens

128
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:36,882
to accept the office
of Mayor of Montreuil.

129
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,954
Mesdames et Messieurs,
Monsieur Madeleine.

130
00:08:46,883 --> 00:08:48,883
Monsieur Madeleine!

131
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:18,883
Citizens of Montreuil,
my friends…

132
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:24,882
…I thank you for the, erm,
trust that you've, you've…

133
00:09:24,883 --> 00:09:26,883
you've shown in me.

134
00:09:38,931 --> 00:09:39,963
Good day.

135
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,001
Monsieur Madeleine!

136
00:09:55,907 --> 00:09:58,025
Excuse me.
I'm looking for some work.

137
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:17,883
Come.

138
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:20,946
Come. Nothing to be frightened of.

139
00:10:20,947 --> 00:10:22,887
Sit here.

140
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:29,931
Your name?

141
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,914
Fantine, monsieur,

142
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:34,898
Fantine Thibault.

143
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:36,906
And you are new in the town?

144
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:37,930
Yes.

145
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:40,974
I was living in Paris.
What work were you doing there?

146
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:43,946
I was a seamstress
at a dressmaker's.

147
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:46,910
Well, the work here needs
nimble fingers too,

148
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,886
so, you think you can learn it?
Yes.

149
00:10:49,887 --> 00:10:52,882
And if you take me,
I'll work very hard.

150
00:10:52,883 --> 00:10:54,914
You won't regret it.

151
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:55,955
Good.

152
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:01,883
So what are your, erm,
family circumstances?

153
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,906
I am alone in the world, sir.

154
00:11:07,907 --> 00:11:09,930
No husband? No.

155
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:11,907
No lover?

156
00:11:14,931 --> 00:11:16,878
No children?

157
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,883
As I said, sir, I'm…

158
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:20,966
I'm alone in the world.

159
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:23,914
It's very important to me
and to you, Fantine,

160
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:25,930
that you're completely honest
with me.

161
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:27,930
You don't believe me?

162
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:31,990
Why should you care about my life
anyway? I care about all my workers.

163
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:35,907
So…

164
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:40,883
…all alone in the world?

165
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:44,883
Yes, monsieur.

166
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,954
I'll take you on
a month's probation.

167
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:51,931
And if you work well,
you can prosper here.

168
00:11:54,907 --> 00:11:57,954
Thank you, monsieur. Thank you.

169
00:11:57,955 --> 00:12:00,906
Madame Victurnien,
will you show her to a table?

170
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:02,906
Are you are able to begin
right away?

171
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:05,260
Yes, of course, Monsieur Madeleine.
Good.

172
00:12:06,883 --> 00:12:09,955
Well, go now.
Thank you again, monsieur.

173
00:12:12,955 --> 00:12:14,907
Thank you.

174
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:32,930
His bedhead's supposed to be
solid gold.

175
00:12:32,931 --> 00:12:35,894
Carved angels, wings - everything.

176
00:12:35,895 --> 00:12:38,543
I wouldn't mind spreading
my wings in his bed.

177
00:12:38,931 --> 00:12:40,927
What?!

178
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,986
Be a bit gentler, Fantine.
You don't want to snag it.

179
00:12:45,923 --> 00:12:47,899
That's good, Fantine.

180
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,919
You're getting the hang of it.

181
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:07,955
Monsieur le Maire!

182
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:12,975
All right, boys?

183
00:13:15,883 --> 00:13:16,971
There you are.

184
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:19,950
All right?

185
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:22,883
Here, take that. Good boy.

186
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:41,911
And I hope this finds you well,
Monsieur and Madame Thenardier…

187
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:45,918
…and that my Cosette has been
a good girl for you.

188
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,906
Tell her Maman loves her

189
00:14:48,907 --> 00:14:51,882
and sends her a thousand kisses,

190
00:14:51,883 --> 00:14:54,906
and hopes to be able to fetch
her very soon. Collect her.

191
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:56,879
Collect her.

192
00:14:57,967 --> 00:14:59,902
Thank you.

193
00:14:59,903 --> 00:15:01,926
And she sends you a thousand kisses.
Mwah!

194
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:04,882
And hopes to be able to
collect her very soon.

195
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:06,966
"I remain your very humble…"
Oooh!

196
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:08,930
Et cetera, et cetera.

197
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:11,906
Very fancy language!
She sent the money, eh?

198
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:14,906
Sent a bit extra to buy the dear
little thing some treats.

199
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:17,922
That won't be happening. If she's
got enough to send a bit extra,

200
00:15:17,923 --> 00:15:20,910
it's time to raise the rates.
What do you reckon? 12 francs?

201
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:24,906
No, 15. I'll write to her today.
I could do with a treat, Thenardier.

202
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:26,958
And you shall get one,
my little pigeon.

203
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,882
All in good time,
when things look up a bit.

204
00:15:30,883 --> 00:15:33,882
Any spare cash has got to go
towards the bills.

205
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:35,906
I don't know what it is,
but whatever I do,

206
00:15:35,907 --> 00:15:37,906
nothing seems to prosper. Oh!

207
00:15:37,907 --> 00:15:40,906
The Wild Duck down the road
gets plenty of custom. Why not me?

208
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:42,882
Back in your corner, Gavroche!

209
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:44,922
Come on, you little beast,
and out of my sight.

210
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:46,942
Do you know, it's a strange thing,
Thenardier,

211
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,878
but I've never been able to
take to that one.

212
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:52,890
I could do anything for my girls,
but that nasty little creature

213
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:54,966
doesn't bring any maternal
instincts out in me at all.

214
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:58,262
Born under a bad sign, love.
Nothing you can do about it.

215
00:15:58,971 --> 00:16:01,906
Do you know, Thenardier,
you know you said how

216
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:04,890
it's funny this place never
seems to prosper? Yes, my dear.

217
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:06,966
Have you ever considered, my love,

218
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,930
that people talk?

219
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:10,970
And the coachman, like,
he might say,

220
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:14,890
"Oh, don't go in there, sir, cos
Thenardier waters down the beer

221
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,244
"and short changes you
into the bargain!"

222
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:23,696
I've often thought you could have a sign outside
saying, "Come in here if you want to be swindled."

223
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:28,906
You shut your mouth.

224
00:16:28,907 --> 00:16:31,930
When I want your advice,
I'll ask for it, yeah?

225
00:16:31,931 --> 00:16:33,907
Go!

226
00:16:35,939 --> 00:16:38,883
What are you looking at?
You want some too?

227
00:17:23,883 --> 00:17:25,882
Monsieur le Maire,

228
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:28,354
the new Chief of Police
is here to see you.

229
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:33,907
Monsieur le Maire, I thought
we should become acquainted.

230
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:36,883
My name is Javert.

231
00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:39,907
I arrived in Montreuil last night.

232
00:17:45,907 --> 00:17:47,938
Please take a seat, Inspector.

233
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:51,942
Can I offer you a drink?
No, thank you, Monsieur le Maire.

234
00:17:51,943 --> 00:17:55,882
Forgive me, is that how
you prefer to be addressed?

235
00:17:55,883 --> 00:17:57,954
I have heard you called
Pere Madeleine?

236
00:17:57,955 --> 00:18:00,883
No, Monsieur le Maire will do.

237
00:18:04,955 --> 00:18:07,883
You have a fine establishment here.

238
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:09,954
Thank you.

239
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:13,882
I am told you have restored
the prosperity of the town

240
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:16,906
by giving employment to all those
who are willing to work.

241
00:18:16,907 --> 00:18:18,970
Consequently, there's very
little crime here.

242
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:21,906
Yes, I like to think
that that is so.

243
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:24,954
But a thief does not steal
because he is poor and desperate,

244
00:18:24,955 --> 00:18:27,930
he steals because he has
a criminal mentality,

245
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:30,954
because he is degenerate,

246
00:18:30,955 --> 00:18:33,915
because he is, to put it simply…

247
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:35,967
…wicked.

248
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:41,907
Well, there I have to tell you
that we disagree.

249
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:45,907
Really?

250
00:18:46,931 --> 00:18:49,930
I believe most of us are capable
of good and evil,

251
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:52,954
and how we turn out depends
on our circumstances

252
00:18:52,955 --> 00:18:54,955
and how we are treated.

253
00:18:59,883 --> 00:19:03,060
And has your own experience
led you to that conclusion?

254
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:10,923
Yes, it has.

255
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:18,930
Monsieur le Maire,

256
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:22,883
I look forward to many interesting
discussions on this topic.

257
00:19:23,883 --> 00:19:27,954
For now, let me assure you
that as your Chief of Police,

258
00:19:27,955 --> 00:19:31,906
I shall do everything in my power

259
00:19:31,907 --> 00:19:34,954
to seek out, apprehend and punish

260
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:38,907
every single wrong-doer
in your fine town.

261
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:48,931
Glad to hear it, Inspector.

262
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:55,882
I think your task won't be too
demanding here in Montreuil.

263
00:19:55,883 --> 00:19:56,938
Perhaps.

264
00:19:56,939 --> 00:19:58,930
On cursory inspection,

265
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,890
your citizens seem to be contented
and well ordered.

266
00:20:02,891 --> 00:20:06,186
So, why does an ambitious man
choose a posting like this?

267
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:10,955
You deduce that I am ambitious.

268
00:20:12,883 --> 00:20:16,930
Since I left the Prison Service,
I have dedicated myself

269
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:19,954
to pursuing not only
the obvious offences,

270
00:20:19,955 --> 00:20:21,931
but the hidden ones.

271
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,284
Not only in the present,
but in the past.

272
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:30,906
Sometimes a man may be seen
to be rich, successful,

273
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:32,931
prosperous, virtuous…

274
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:37,955
…while all the time he may be
harbouring a secret.

275
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:41,931
Something rotten in his past.

276
00:20:43,907 --> 00:20:46,907
Is it right that such a secret
should remain hidden?

277
00:20:47,883 --> 00:20:50,906
Is it right that such a man
should continue to enjoy the fruits

278
00:20:50,907 --> 00:20:52,906
of his wickedness undiscovered?

279
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:56,025
You think there is such a man
here in this town? Oh…

280
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,707
There are such men everywhere,
Monsieur le Maire.

281
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:05,882
That's what makes my work
so fascinating.

282
00:21:05,883 --> 00:21:09,178
Of course, one must have
incontrovertible proof of guilt.

283
00:21:11,883 --> 00:21:13,060
And that takes time.

284
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:16,931
Well, I don't want to keep you.

285
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:21,907
It's been a pleasure to make
your acquaintance. Likewise.

286
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:25,882
You know, I've been thinking,
as we've talked,

287
00:21:25,883 --> 00:21:29,589
you remind me of someone I used
to know rather well at one time.

288
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:33,882
He stole from a child

289
00:21:33,883 --> 00:21:36,883
and never paid for his crime.

290
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,883
I can't recall his name now.

291
00:21:45,883 --> 00:21:46,930
Ah, well.

292
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,907
Goodnight…

293
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:51,911
…Monsieur le Maire.

294
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:20,882
I still can't believe
he didn't invite me.

295
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:22,942
Fabs would, wouldn't you, Fabby?
Shut up!

296
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:25,882
Has anyone ever been up there?

297
00:22:25,883 --> 00:22:27,954
I bet he'd let Fantine in though.
Why me?

298
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:30,906
Cos he likes you
and we've seen him looking.

299
00:22:30,907 --> 00:22:33,930
I bet he'd let you in his room.
Let you in his bed!

300
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:35,954
Would you, if he asked? No!

301
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,938
All right, hoity-toity.

302
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,906
What's that, Fantine? That's pretty.
It's nothing.

303
00:22:40,907 --> 00:22:42,894
Look, Fabs, it's a little bird!

304
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,882
Ah, that is nice.

305
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:46,882
Who's it for? No-one.

306
00:22:46,883 --> 00:22:47,954
Look out, Vicky's coming.

307
00:22:47,955 --> 00:22:49,918
What's this?

308
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:50,967
Show me.

309
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:00,955
Who told you to do this?

310
00:23:02,955 --> 00:23:05,882
No-one, madame,
but I'd finished my quota.

311
00:23:05,883 --> 00:23:08,882
You're not here to amuse yourself
when you finish your quota.

312
00:23:08,883 --> 00:23:10,878
You ask for more work.
Sorry, madame.

313
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:14,883
I've a good mind to dismiss you
on the spot. Please, no, madame.

314
00:23:15,883 --> 00:23:16,951
Please.

315
00:23:20,907 --> 00:23:23,883
Consider this a final warning.

316
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:30,907
Nasty old bitch.

317
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:52,954
"I know your little girl's health
and happiness is as dear to you

318
00:23:52,955 --> 00:23:55,954
"as it is to my dear wife and me.

319
00:23:55,955 --> 00:24:00,906
"A trifling sum…" A trifling sum?
This fellow writes abominably.

320
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:04,882
"A trifling sum of 15 francs
a month."

321
00:24:04,883 --> 00:24:06,883
15 francs a month?!

322
00:24:07,907 --> 00:24:09,882
I can't pay that!

323
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:11,930
Do you want to hear the rest
or not?

324
00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:15,906
"We expect to receive this money
due to us

325
00:24:15,907 --> 00:24:17,935
"very promptly."

326
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:33,906
She was some kind
of a prostitute, you say?

327
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:36,906
Well, I don't like to speak ill
of anyone, but, yes,

328
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:38,966
and no doubt the little girl
was conceived in sin

329
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:41,882
and had become some sort
of encumbrance.

330
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:43,882
Doesn't bear thinking about,
does it?

331
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:45,882
These people don't lead
natural lives.

332
00:24:45,883 --> 00:24:47,950
She's probably forgotten all about
the little girl now.

333
00:24:47,951 --> 00:24:49,930
She still writes to you.

334
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:52,958
Oh, yeah, I mean, now and then,
when she thinks about it.

335
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:55,938
"I hope you're looking after
her proper", and all that,

336
00:24:55,939 --> 00:24:58,883
but what good is that to us
or the little girl?

337
00:25:03,943 --> 00:25:05,883
I think…

338
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:10,001
…you have been taken advantage of.

339
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:14,974
You're right there, madame. Are you
thinking of staying a night or two?

340
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:17,938
We have a lovely room on the front
that's vacant just now.

341
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:20,958
I've taken a room at the Wild Duck.
The coachman recommended it.

342
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:22,906
Ah!

343
00:25:22,907 --> 00:25:24,954
I was one of the heroes of Waterloo!

344
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:28,906
I was awarded the Legion d'Honneur
by Napoleon himself.

345
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:30,954
Would you care to examine it?
No, thank you.

346
00:25:30,955 --> 00:25:34,014
No… yeah. Good day to you.
Thank you for your time.

347
00:25:35,895 --> 00:25:37,906
Miserable old cow, eh?

348
00:25:37,907 --> 00:25:38,955
Tant pis!

349
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,902
Oh, shut up!

350
00:25:41,903 --> 00:25:43,923
Vive Napoleon!

351
00:25:45,883 --> 00:25:47,942
Napoleon Bonaparte
did more harm to France

352
00:25:47,943 --> 00:25:51,974
than all the armies of Britain,
Russia and Austria combined.

353
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:54,954
Hear, hear. A barbarian, a savage,

354
00:25:54,955 --> 00:25:57,958
and thanks be to God,
now a despised exile.

355
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:07,902
But here is a young man
who thinks in the right way.

356
00:26:07,903 --> 00:26:08,954
Gentlemen,

357
00:26:08,955 --> 00:26:10,931
my grandson…

358
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:14,883
…Marius Pontmercy.

359
00:26:18,915 --> 00:26:21,882
Napoleon was a traitor
to his country

360
00:26:21,883 --> 00:26:24,882
and my father was a traitor
to his country too.

361
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,883
I spit upon them both!

362
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:31,910
Vive le Roi! Vive la France!

363
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:33,975
Vive le Roi! Vive la France!

364
00:26:34,975 --> 00:26:36,975
Good boy.

365
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:41,907
Monsieur, this letter
has just arrived.

366
00:26:44,955 --> 00:26:47,882
Well, young man,

367
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:50,882
it seems your father

368
00:26:50,883 --> 00:26:53,882
is on his deathbed.

369
00:26:53,883 --> 00:26:56,894
Now, what do you say…

370
00:26:56,895 --> 00:26:58,883
to that?

371
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:02,934
Good! Ha-ha!

372
00:27:02,935 --> 00:27:04,890
And so do I!

373
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:06,887
So do I!

374
00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:10,882
Well, off you go, my dear.

375
00:27:10,883 --> 00:27:13,882
The boy should see his father
before he dies, monsieur.

376
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,883
It's only right.

377
00:27:16,883 --> 00:27:20,883
Well, I won't forbid it,
if he wants to go.

378
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:22,955
Do you?

379
00:27:31,935 --> 00:27:35,882
If you don't, you might be sorry
your whole life.

380
00:27:35,883 --> 00:27:37,971
It's all right, I'll go with you.

381
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:40,895
Hm?

382
00:27:42,883 --> 00:27:43,946
Women!

383
00:27:43,947 --> 00:27:45,974
You have to love them, don't you?

384
00:28:08,931 --> 00:28:10,930
You're a liar, aren't you?

385
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:12,954
Monsieur le Maire, come quickly!

386
00:28:12,955 --> 00:28:14,954
Monsieur Madeleine! Madame…

387
00:28:14,955 --> 00:28:17,906
Monsieur… No, please!
No, I have to go.

388
00:28:17,907 --> 00:28:18,970
Monsieur! Monsieur!

389
00:28:18,971 --> 00:28:20,902
Help me!

390
00:28:20,903 --> 00:28:22,882
Unload that cart!

391
00:28:22,883 --> 00:28:24,882
Control that horse!

392
00:28:24,883 --> 00:28:26,927
Someone untether the horse.

393
00:28:28,931 --> 00:28:30,906
Help me!

394
00:28:30,907 --> 00:28:31,946
Aaargh!

395
00:28:31,947 --> 00:28:34,899
Hold on, Constable,
we'll get you out!

396
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:38,970
Get someone to get it!

397
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:41,970
That's 20 minutes from here.
He'll be crushed to death by then!

398
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:43,966
It's all in hand, Monsieur le Maire.

399
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:45,950
Help me!

400
00:28:45,951 --> 00:28:47,907
Aaargh!

401
00:28:55,879 --> 00:28:56,939
Argh!

402
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:02,883
Argh!

403
00:29:03,883 --> 00:29:04,923
Aaargh!

404
00:29:08,883 --> 00:29:09,931
Argh!

405
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:14,887
Aaargh!

406
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:37,026
Congratulations, Monsieur le Maire.

407
00:29:39,927 --> 00:29:41,907
Most instructive.

408
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:44,955
And witnessed by so many.

409
00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:55,906
Monsieur Madeleine.

410
00:29:55,907 --> 00:29:56,946
Not now.

411
00:29:56,947 --> 00:30:00,882
This immoral young woman
is a disgrace to the factory

412
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,954
and the town.
It's not true. I'm innocent!

413
00:30:02,955 --> 00:30:06,906
I regret to say, monsieur,
she is no better than a whore.

414
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:09,954
She has a bastard child
she abandoned at Montfermeil.

415
00:30:09,955 --> 00:30:11,930
I never abandoned her!

416
00:30:11,931 --> 00:30:15,882
I never abandoned her.
I send 15 francs per month.

417
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:18,906
More than half my wages. Lying
little whore. You're a disgrace!

418
00:30:18,907 --> 00:30:21,906
Monsieur le Maire, believe me.
My Cosette is all I care about.

419
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:22,958
Lying little whore!

420
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:25,954
This is what she does when
she's supposed to be working.

421
00:30:25,955 --> 00:30:28,882
A toy for her little bastard.
Believe me…

422
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:30,883
Enough, both of you! Enough!

423
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:33,930
Fantine Thibault?

424
00:30:33,931 --> 00:30:35,955
Yes, monsieur.

425
00:30:36,955 --> 00:30:39,930
I remember I asked you about
your family and you said

426
00:30:39,931 --> 00:30:41,906
you were alone in the world.

427
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:44,914
I thought if I told you about my
little girl you'd turn me away.

428
00:30:44,915 --> 00:30:46,883
You lied to me!

429
00:30:47,907 --> 00:30:49,906
There was no harm in it.

430
00:30:49,907 --> 00:30:52,894
I was frightened of you.
Don't listen to her, monsieur.

431
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:55,890
She's an immoral woman.
I am not! I am not.

432
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:57,935
But the child is yours?

433
00:30:59,883 --> 00:31:01,930
Is that a crime?
And she abandoned it.

434
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:03,906
No, I didn't!

435
00:31:03,907 --> 00:31:06,879
Please believe me.
I can't believe you!

436
00:31:14,955 --> 00:31:16,931
You're dismissed.

437
00:31:17,931 --> 00:31:19,927
But what am I going to do?

438
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:24,633
There's 50 francs. I advise you
to leave the town, mademoiselle.

439
00:31:24,955 --> 00:31:28,882
But I can't leave this town.
I owe people money here.

440
00:31:28,883 --> 00:31:30,907
Well, find some other employment!

441
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:40,931
They said that you were
a kind and good man.

442
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:44,967
And I thought you were.

443
00:31:46,883 --> 00:31:47,958
But you're not.

444
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:49,954
You're a monster! A monster!

445
00:31:49,955 --> 00:31:51,954
That's enough! That's enough!

446
00:31:51,955 --> 00:31:54,938
How dare you insult
our good Pere Madeleine?

447
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:56,882
Out now!

448
00:31:56,883 --> 00:31:57,939
This minute!

449
00:32:46,895 --> 00:32:47,955
Come on!

450
00:32:49,907 --> 00:32:52,883
Come on! Come on! Steady!

451
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:17,931
Chief Inspector, my name is Javert.

452
00:33:19,883 --> 00:33:21,906
I have just taken charge
in Montreuil.

453
00:33:21,907 --> 00:33:24,882
Inspector Javert,
what are you doing in Paris?

454
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:26,906
I've identified
a dangerous criminal.

455
00:33:26,907 --> 00:33:29,914
I've come to consult you on
how to proceed. Who is this man?

456
00:33:29,915 --> 00:33:31,882
His name is Jean Valjean.

457
00:33:31,883 --> 00:33:34,882
I knew him years ago
at the prison hulks at Toulon.

458
00:33:34,883 --> 00:33:37,950
He stole from a child within days
of his release and fled.

459
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:40,930
A man of exceptional strength
and brutality.

460
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:43,882
He's now posing as the Mayor
of Montreuil.

461
00:33:43,883 --> 00:33:44,935
You're mistaken.

462
00:33:46,883 --> 00:33:47,974
I tell you, I know the man.

463
00:33:47,975 --> 00:33:49,954
Jean Valjean is in custody.

464
00:33:49,955 --> 00:33:53,930
He was arrested four days ago
in Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher.

465
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,930
In due course, he will stand trial.

466
00:33:55,931 --> 00:33:58,883
Has this man confessed
to being Jean Valjean?

467
00:33:59,883 --> 00:34:00,974
Not yet, but he will.

468
00:34:00,975 --> 00:34:03,906
He has been identified.
But monsieur…

469
00:34:03,907 --> 00:34:06,906
And bear in mind,
it's a very serious matter,

470
00:34:06,907 --> 00:34:09,907
making accusations against
important public figures.

471
00:34:10,903 --> 00:34:13,907
I'd advise you to be more careful,
Inspector Javert.

472
00:35:25,907 --> 00:35:27,907
Evening, Monsieur le Maire.

473
00:36:08,907 --> 00:36:09,975
Mon pere?

474
00:36:18,907 --> 00:36:20,883
You came.

475
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:26,951
Good boy.

476
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:30,883
You will be Baron Pontmercy now.

477
00:36:31,975 --> 00:36:34,906
The honour was bestowed on me

478
00:36:34,907 --> 00:36:37,907
by Napoleon himself at Waterloo.

479
00:36:39,955 --> 00:36:42,895
Now it is yours by right.

480
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:47,883
There's a man…

481
00:36:48,955 --> 00:36:50,955
…called Thenardier.

482
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:56,915
He saved my life.

483
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:02,883
If you ever meet him,
do the best, you can.

484
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,954
The child has caught
a miliary fever.

485
00:37:35,955 --> 00:37:37,882
Oh, my God.

486
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:40,907
They're asking for money
for medicine. 40 francs.

487
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:44,931
My poor child.

488
00:37:46,883 --> 00:37:49,883
Why not go and fetch
your daughter here?

489
00:37:50,883 --> 00:37:52,898
And have her share my wretched life?

490
00:37:52,899 --> 00:37:55,194
I don't want to bring shame
on her head.

491
00:37:56,931 --> 00:37:58,931
She's better off where she is.

492
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:02,938
Though God knows how I'll find
the money for her keep now.

493
00:38:02,939 --> 00:38:04,879
Well…

494
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:07,997
…you're a very pretty young woman.

495
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:12,882
There's always ways…

496
00:38:12,883 --> 00:38:14,931
that a pretty young woman can…

497
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:17,891
…make a living.

498
00:38:18,891 --> 00:38:20,887
If you know what I mean.

499
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:32,907
Bonsoir, monsieur.

500
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:19,882
I'm buying and I'm selling,
I'm selling and I'm buying tonight.

501
00:39:19,883 --> 00:39:22,930
If you're bald and toothless,
you can change your life.

502
00:39:22,931 --> 00:39:26,886
I'm selling and I'm buying tonight,
ladies and gentlemen!

503
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:29,882
I've got golden,
I've got glossy black,

504
00:39:29,883 --> 00:39:33,882
I've got curly, I've got straight,
I've got long and I've got short.

505
00:39:33,883 --> 00:39:36,891
Here, have a feel of this one.

506
00:39:37,891 --> 00:39:39,882
Is that soft as silk?

507
00:39:39,883 --> 00:39:40,926
And teeth!

508
00:39:40,927 --> 00:39:44,914
How'd you like to go home tonight
with a lovely new set of teeth?

509
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,930
And I'll take what you've got
in part exchange.

510
00:39:47,931 --> 00:39:50,882
Can't say fairer than that now,
can I?

511
00:39:50,883 --> 00:39:52,907
Oh, I say, there's a beauty.

512
00:39:54,883 --> 00:39:57,119
Make way, ladies.
Let her come through.

513
00:40:00,883 --> 00:40:02,883
That's it, my dear.

514
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:14,930
Now, that is as lovely a head of
hair as I've seen in a long while.

515
00:40:14,931 --> 00:40:16,943
Let it all down, my dear.

516
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:25,882
Are you selling, dear? How much?

517
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:27,922
Ten francs. Is that all?

518
00:40:27,923 --> 00:40:30,931
That's the top rate.
You won't get more anywhere.

519
00:40:32,907 --> 00:40:36,966
But if you was thinking of parting
with those lovely white teeth, now.

520
00:40:37,907 --> 00:40:39,930
Just the two front ones even.

521
00:40:39,931 --> 00:40:42,946
I could give you
two Napoleons for those.

522
00:40:42,947 --> 00:40:44,958
40 francs.

523
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:47,878
50 altogether.

524
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,883
Just five minutes' work.

525
00:40:50,883 --> 00:40:51,955
What do you say?

526
00:40:59,883 --> 00:41:00,954
All right.

527
00:41:00,955 --> 00:41:03,906
A short intermission,
ladies and gentlemen.

528
00:41:03,907 --> 00:41:05,883
Don't go away!

529
00:41:14,883 --> 00:41:16,931
Sit yourself down there, my love.

530
00:41:37,907 --> 00:41:39,882
What's your name?

531
00:41:39,883 --> 00:41:40,930
Fantine.

532
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,883
Lovely.

533
00:41:44,907 --> 00:41:46,882
Look at this, mother.

534
00:41:46,883 --> 00:41:49,883
We don't often see anything
as good as this, do we?

535
00:41:52,883 --> 00:41:56,883
Now, are you quite sure you
want to go through with this?

536
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,472
You're allowed to change
your mind, you know.

537
00:42:04,883 --> 00:42:05,931
I'm sure.

538
00:42:06,931 --> 00:42:08,895
Here we go, then.

539
00:42:30,907 --> 00:42:32,931
That's it. Nearly done.

540
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,931
Goody good, mother.

541
00:42:45,907 --> 00:42:48,907
There. It'll soon grow again,
I dare say.

542
00:42:52,935 --> 00:42:55,907
Right, help me hold her still,
Mother.

543
00:42:57,971 --> 00:42:59,930
Aargh!

544
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:01,930
Aaaargh!

545
00:43:01,931 --> 00:43:03,910
It's coming.

546
00:43:03,911 --> 00:43:05,882
Aaargh!

547
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,894
Yes! Aargh!

548
00:43:07,895 --> 00:43:09,903
Argh!

549
00:43:10,919 --> 00:43:12,883
Number one.

550
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,970
Aargh! Aargh!

551
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:18,963
Shh, it's coming.

552
00:43:19,963 --> 00:43:21,931
Argh!

553
00:43:47,967 --> 00:43:49,966
That's more like it.

554
00:43:49,967 --> 00:43:51,954
She must be rolling in it!

555
00:43:51,955 --> 00:43:55,906
I don't think we've been asking
for enough, what do you think?

556
00:43:55,907 --> 00:43:57,930
The poor little girl's
at death's door

557
00:43:57,931 --> 00:44:00,906
and the doctor's demanding,
what do you reckon?

558
00:44:00,907 --> 00:44:01,942
100?Yes!

559
00:44:01,943 --> 00:44:03,955
Go on, do it properly.

560
00:44:05,923 --> 00:44:08,954
"We beg that you do all you can
for little Cosette.

561
00:44:08,955 --> 00:44:10,931
"Thenardier."

562
00:44:11,931 --> 00:44:14,899
Tell them I'll send it
as soon as I can.

563
00:44:18,883 --> 00:44:20,958
And how are you going to
raise the money, hm?

564
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:23,942
I've sold my hair and my teeth.

565
00:44:23,943 --> 00:44:27,883
I might as well get on with it
and sell the rest.

566
00:44:28,883 --> 00:44:30,001
Ah, mademoiselle…

567
00:44:30,955 --> 00:44:32,962
…what a shame. You think so?

568
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:35,946
You've gone about it
the wrong way round, my dear.

569
00:44:35,947 --> 00:44:38,882
You should have gone on the game

570
00:44:38,883 --> 00:44:43,883
before you sold your pretty hair
and your lovely white teeth.

571
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:48,954
Who's going to take you,
looking like that?

572
00:44:48,955 --> 00:44:50,931
Hm?

573
00:45:05,907 --> 00:45:07,883
Get out!

574
00:46:06,883 --> 00:46:08,902
Fantine? Is that you?

575
00:46:08,903 --> 00:46:09,931
Fantine?

576
00:46:11,883 --> 00:46:13,883
Fantine. Leave her.

577
00:46:19,931 --> 00:46:21,907
Evening, ladies!

578
00:46:23,931 --> 00:46:26,883
Lovely night for it. Indeed it is.

579
00:46:28,883 --> 00:46:29,955
Oh, my God!

580
00:46:31,883 --> 00:46:33,942
What have we got here?

581
00:46:33,943 --> 00:46:35,931
What a sight!

582
00:46:37,907 --> 00:46:40,927
And how much do you charge, baldy?

583
00:46:42,927 --> 00:46:45,222
Whatever you think it's worth,
monsieur.

584
00:46:47,883 --> 00:46:49,891
How about nothing, then?

585
00:46:51,891 --> 00:46:54,886
You hear that, gentlemen?
How about nothing?

586
00:46:54,887 --> 00:46:58,898
That's all she's worth! But I have
to live, monsieur, the same as you.

587
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,886
The same as me? You cheeky cow!

588
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,906
Did you ever hear the like of it?!

589
00:47:03,907 --> 00:47:05,907
You think I do this for fun?

590
00:47:07,883 --> 00:47:09,931
I do it to feed my little girl.

591
00:47:10,931 --> 00:47:13,882
So, if you don't want business,

592
00:47:13,883 --> 00:47:15,882
do me a favour…

593
00:47:15,883 --> 00:47:17,883
and move along.

594
00:47:18,883 --> 00:47:19,907
Oh.

595
00:47:20,907 --> 00:47:23,883
Oh, I stand rebuked.

596
00:47:26,955 --> 00:47:30,894
I humbly beg your pardon,
mademoiselle.

597
00:47:30,895 --> 00:47:33,013
Might I ask your name, mademoiselle?

598
00:47:34,907 --> 00:47:36,907
Fantine, monsieur.

599
00:47:37,907 --> 00:47:39,883
Bonsoir, Fantine.

600
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:42,883
I hope I am forgiven.

601
00:47:43,883 --> 00:47:45,883
Bonsoir, monsieur.

602
00:47:50,883 --> 00:47:52,914
Fantine, something for you.

603
00:48:02,931 --> 00:48:03,975
Help!

604
00:48:05,939 --> 00:48:07,911
You, come with me.

605
00:48:11,879 --> 00:48:13,930
This is an outrage
that cannot be tolerated.

606
00:48:13,931 --> 00:48:15,958
A respectable property-owning
citizen

607
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:17,966
attacked by a common prostitute!

608
00:48:17,967 --> 00:48:20,974
Take this whore to the cells.
Yes, sir. You've got six months.

609
00:48:20,975 --> 00:48:23,926
Six months? But what about my child?

610
00:48:23,927 --> 00:48:25,954
That's no concern of mine.
Take her away.

611
00:48:25,955 --> 00:48:28,930
Please, Monsieur Javert!
I wasn't always like this!

612
00:48:28,931 --> 00:48:31,954
I was a good girl… Take her away!
She stinks of degradation.

613
00:48:31,955 --> 00:48:33,907
One moment!

614
00:48:34,907 --> 00:48:36,883
Monsieur le Maire.

615
00:48:41,947 --> 00:48:43,930
Monsieur le Maire?

616
00:48:43,931 --> 00:48:45,919
Ha!

617
00:48:46,919 --> 00:48:48,906
Seize her, you fool!

618
00:48:48,907 --> 00:48:50,946
You see this man here?

619
00:48:50,947 --> 00:48:55,898
You see this monster here
that you call Monsieur le Maire?

620
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:57,883
It's all his fault!

621
00:48:58,883 --> 00:49:00,930
He's supposed to be so good.
What did he do?

622
00:49:00,931 --> 00:49:02,930
He threw me out on the street.

623
00:49:02,931 --> 00:49:06,882
And you know why? Because I tried
to care for my little girl!

624
00:49:06,883 --> 00:49:08,883
Monster of a mayor!

625
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:13,907
Monsieur le Maire, a monster?

626
00:49:14,907 --> 00:49:17,934
You understand now.
You'll let me go now?

627
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:20,882
I'll be a good little whore now.

628
00:49:20,883 --> 00:49:23,882
They can do what they like with me
and I won't complain.

629
00:49:23,883 --> 00:49:26,930
All I want is to be able to work
to feed my child

630
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:28,954
and fetch her from Montfermeil.

631
00:49:28,955 --> 00:49:31,922
Please, I can't… I can't breathe.

632
00:49:31,923 --> 00:49:33,930
Feel it. Get away from me!

633
00:49:33,931 --> 00:49:36,902
No! I will take her into my care.

634
00:49:36,903 --> 00:49:37,966
You have no right!

635
00:49:41,923 --> 00:49:45,882
Fantine, I was wrong to dismiss you.

636
00:49:45,883 --> 00:49:46,950
I was wrong.

637
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:49,954
Perhaps it's too late,
but let me try to make amends.

638
00:49:49,955 --> 00:49:54,014
I'll pay your debts, I'll find your
child so that you can be together.

639
00:49:54,947 --> 00:49:56,954
You need never work again.

640
00:49:56,955 --> 00:49:59,954
I'll take care of you, I promise.

641
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,907
You mean it?

642
00:50:02,907 --> 00:50:04,899
It's not a joke?

643
00:50:08,879 --> 00:50:10,954
Let me take you to the infirmary.
Come on.

644
00:50:10,955 --> 00:50:13,906
Come with me. No, I forbid it.

645
00:50:13,907 --> 00:50:16,930
This woman has been sentenced
and she is going to prison.

646
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:19,882
Take her to the cells.
Don't touch her!

647
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:22,898
Monsieur Javert, in municipal
matters, I outrank you.

648
00:50:22,899 --> 00:50:24,938
I warn you,
don't cross me over this.

649
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:28,410
What exactly does this woman mean
to you, Monsieur le Maire?

650
00:50:28,975 --> 00:50:31,882
Someone who needs my help.

651
00:50:31,883 --> 00:50:32,950
A common whore?

652
00:50:32,951 --> 00:50:35,883
She is the lowest of the low.

653
00:50:36,883 --> 00:50:40,891
You would risk your good name
to help a creature like that?

654
00:50:46,907 --> 00:50:49,878
She's one of God's creatures,
Monsieur Javert,

655
00:50:49,879 --> 00:50:52,886
and she has suffered grievously
through no fault of her own.

656
00:50:52,887 --> 00:50:56,417
I injured her myself, and now
I want to make amends if I can.

657
00:50:58,907 --> 00:51:00,883
You astonish me.

658
00:51:02,955 --> 00:51:04,955
Now stand out of my way.

659
00:51:45,931 --> 00:51:48,883
What are you doing here?

660
00:51:50,931 --> 00:51:52,882
I'm…

661
00:51:52,883 --> 00:51:54,883
I'm praying for you.

662
00:51:55,883 --> 00:51:56,954
And for myself.

663
00:51:56,955 --> 00:51:58,927
Will you…

664
00:51:59,927 --> 00:52:02,930
…send for my daughter…

665
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:05,882
Cosette, please?

666
00:52:05,883 --> 00:52:06,959
Yes, of course.

667
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:10,887
If necessary,
I'll go for her myself.

668
00:52:20,883 --> 00:52:22,883
I've been a… a sinner.

669
00:52:25,883 --> 00:52:28,883
But when I have Cosette with me…

670
00:52:29,883 --> 00:52:30,962
…it will mean…

671
00:52:30,963 --> 00:52:33,955
that God has forgiven me.

672
00:52:43,883 --> 00:52:46,883
Inspector Javert is here,
Monsieur le Maire.

673
00:52:58,907 --> 00:53:00,903
Sit down, Inspector.

674
00:53:01,903 --> 00:53:04,906
Thank you, Monsieur le Maire.
I prefer to stand.

675
00:53:04,907 --> 00:53:07,882
As you wish. What can I do for you?

676
00:53:07,883 --> 00:53:09,938
I have come to report
a serious misdemeanour

677
00:53:09,939 --> 00:53:11,954
by an officer of the police.

678
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:13,907
Which officer?

679
00:53:14,907 --> 00:53:16,882
Myself.

680
00:53:16,883 --> 00:53:19,001
I have come to offer my resignation.

681
00:53:19,899 --> 00:53:20,954
For what reason?

682
00:53:20,955 --> 00:53:24,975
Firstly, I'd like to apologise
for my conduct earlier and…

683
00:53:28,883 --> 00:53:32,883
I denounced you to police
headquarters in Paris.

684
00:53:33,907 --> 00:53:36,954
I suspected you,
wrongly as it turns out,

685
00:53:36,955 --> 00:53:41,931
to be a notorious felon, once known
to me as Prisoner Number 24601.

686
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:44,971
A man named Jean Valjean.

687
00:53:45,971 --> 00:53:47,947
But you were wrong.

688
00:53:48,947 --> 00:53:50,907
Yes.

689
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:53,907
It seems I was.

690
00:53:54,907 --> 00:53:56,883
What, erm…

691
00:53:59,883 --> 00:54:01,906
What made you change your mind?

692
00:54:01,907 --> 00:54:04,882
Monsieur le Maire,
the real Valjean…

693
00:54:04,883 --> 00:54:05,955
has been found.

694
00:54:10,931 --> 00:54:12,882
What?

695
00:54:12,883 --> 00:54:16,930
He's about to stand trial in Arras
for a number of offences,

696
00:54:16,931 --> 00:54:21,882
including the theft of a coin
from a child

697
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,882
who went by the name
of Petit Gervais.

698
00:54:24,883 --> 00:54:25,955
Petit Gervais?

699
00:54:28,883 --> 00:54:29,955
Petit Gervais.

700
00:54:31,907 --> 00:54:35,025
Does the name mean anything to you,
Monsieur le Maire?

701
00:54:35,955 --> 00:54:37,954
Has this man confessed?

702
00:54:37,955 --> 00:54:39,907
No.

703
00:54:40,907 --> 00:54:44,882
No, but no doubt his lies
will be exposed in court

704
00:54:44,883 --> 00:54:47,906
and he'll be sentenced
to penal servitude…

705
00:54:47,907 --> 00:54:49,883
for life.

706
00:54:51,907 --> 00:54:53,890
It's over for him.

707
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:55,930
The trial is tomorrow.

708
00:54:55,931 --> 00:54:58,930
I'll take the coach to Arras tonight

709
00:54:58,931 --> 00:55:02,883
and that will be my last duty
as Police Inspector.

710
00:55:16,955 --> 00:55:19,907
Goodnight, Monsieur le Maire.

711
00:55:40,907 --> 00:55:42,954
What can I do for you, Sister?

712
00:55:42,955 --> 00:55:47,883
Our patient, Fantine Thibault,
the prostitute. Don't call her that.

713
00:55:49,955 --> 00:55:53,883
The doctor wanted you to know
that she… She's very weak.

714
00:55:54,883 --> 00:55:56,930
She has very little time left
on this Earth

715
00:55:56,931 --> 00:55:59,882
and she speaks constantly
of seeing her child.

716
00:55:59,883 --> 00:56:00,954
Yes, yes, I know that.

717
00:56:00,955 --> 00:56:04,898
The doctor says if she is to see her
child before she dies, the child…

718
00:56:04,899 --> 00:56:06,907
Yes, I understand, Sister!

719
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,907
I beg your pardon.

720
00:56:11,883 --> 00:56:12,938
Thank you, Sister.

721
00:56:12,939 --> 00:56:14,931
Please do your best for her.

722
00:56:15,931 --> 00:56:19,883
Now there are things that I
have to attend to. Excuse me.

723
00:56:58,907 --> 00:57:02,555
You've got it,
haven't you? You've got my money!

724
00:57:02,939 --> 00:57:04,930
You're a dirty thief!

725
00:57:04,931 --> 00:57:06,907
A curse on you!

726
00:57:21,879 --> 00:57:22,939
Argh!

727
00:57:24,915 --> 00:57:26,907
Aaargh!

728
00:58:01,883 --> 00:58:04,882
Madame Victurnien.
Monsieur Madeleine!

729
00:58:04,883 --> 00:58:06,954
I have an errand for you,
if you'd be so kind.

730
00:58:06,955 --> 00:58:09,906
You remember Fantine Thibault?
Indeed I do.

731
00:58:09,907 --> 00:58:11,954
She's in hospital, she's very ill.

732
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:14,954
I need you to go to Montfermeil
and fetch her little girl.

733
00:58:14,955 --> 00:58:16,930
Bring her here.

734
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:20,883
I'd go myself, but I…
There's somewhere else I have to be.
