1
00:00:02,096 --> 00:00:03,221
His name is Jean Valjean.

2
00:00:03,246 --> 00:00:06,711
He stole from a child and
never paid for his crime.

3
00:00:06,736 --> 00:00:07,911
What are you doing in Paris?

4
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:10,191
I've identified a dangerous criminal.

5
00:00:10,216 --> 00:00:12,630
He's now posing as the Mayor of Montreuil.

6
00:00:12,655 --> 00:00:13,831
You're mistaken.

7
00:00:15,856 --> 00:00:19,430
Maman!
She has a bastard child
she abandoned at Montfermeil!

8
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:21,680
No! I send 15 francs per month.

9
00:00:21,705 --> 00:00:23,430
You lied to me! You're dismissed.

10
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,630
Are you selling, dear?

11
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:30,071
I've been a sinner.

12
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:35,291
But when I have my Cosette with me,
it will mean God has forgiven me.

13
00:00:35,856 --> 00:00:37,711
She must be rolling in it!

14
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:39,500
I don't think you've
been asking for enough!

15
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:41,471
She stinks of degradation.

16
00:00:41,496 --> 00:00:44,500
Fantine! I was wrong. Let
me try to make amends.

17
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:47,191
I'll find your child so
that you can be together.

18
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:48,216
I promise.

19
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:52,430
The real Valjean has been found.

20
00:00:52,455 --> 00:00:54,711
He's about to stand trial in Arras.

21
00:00:54,736 --> 00:00:56,071
It's over for him.

22
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:57,911
The child should be fetched without delay.

23
00:00:57,936 --> 00:00:59,961
Yes, I understand, Sister!

24
00:00:59,986 --> 00:01:02,430
I need you to go to Montfermeil
and fetch her little girl.

25
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:04,221
There's somewhere else I have to be.

26
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,961
Where's Monsieur Madeleine?

27
00:01:13,816 --> 00:01:15,831
Monsieur le Maire's gone to Montfermeil.

28
00:01:23,655 --> 00:01:24,961
Ah!

29
00:01:24,986 --> 00:01:26,510
He's gone to fetch…

30
00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:28,936
…Cosette.

31
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:33,216
That's what it is.

32
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:40,071
He's gone to fetch my little girl.

33
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:41,570
Prisoner at the bar.

34
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:45,780
You stand accused of the theft
of property, to wit, nine apples

35
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:47,570
from the Pierron orchard,

36
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:52,791
which you claim you found on the
ground outside the orchard walls.

37
00:02:55,595 --> 00:03:00,811
It is for the jury to decide whether
your version of events is true.

38
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:02,780
And in making their decision,

39
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:07,251
they will no doubt take into account
the fact that four witnesses -

40
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:11,421
three of your fellow former
prisoners and a former guard

41
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:16,211
of the prison, Inspector Javert -
have identified you as the convicted

42
00:03:16,236 --> 00:03:20,700
felon and fugitive Jean Valjean,
wanted for the theft of 40 sous

43
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:25,450
from a child named Petit-Gervais
and for fleeing justice ever since.

44
00:03:25,475 --> 00:03:26,475
Stand up.

45
00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:30,570
Are you the felon, Jean Valjean?

46
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:38,501
My name is Champmathieu. I come from Paris.
I used to be a wheelwright

47
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:41,061
there for Monsieur Baloup, 20 years -

48
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:42,421
you can ask him, he'll tell you.

49
00:03:42,446 --> 00:03:45,650
Unfortunately, it has
proved impossible to locate

50
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:47,611
this Monsieur Baloup.

51
00:03:47,636 --> 00:03:50,731
Have you anything to say to the
court that may help your defence?

52
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,760
You're very wicked, you are!
Twisting everything!

53
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:01,841
I never stole anything!

54
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,351
You know, I'm a man that
doesn't eat every day.

55
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:08,611
I was coming from Ailly, looking
for work, I nearly starved.

56
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:13,841
Next thing, I'm in jail. I
never was in any prison before.

57
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:17,421
I've never heard of Jean Valjean…

58
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:18,450
Speak up, man!

59
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:20,450
Your confusion will condemn you.

60
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:23,630
Ask Monsieur Baloup!
He'll tell you who I am!

61
00:04:29,176 --> 00:04:30,176
Brevet?

62
00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:33,680
That's jean Valjean, all right.

63
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:36,231
I did nine years alongside him.

64
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:37,256
Chenildieu?

65
00:04:41,226 --> 00:04:42,680
Yeah, that's him.

66
00:04:42,705 --> 00:04:44,921
We were chained together
for five years, sir.

67
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:49,946
Cochepaille?

68
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:56,401
Jean Valjean, there he is.

69
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:58,991
We used to call him
Jean-le-Cric, he was so strong.

70
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:16,585
Silence!

71
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:26,380
Silence! Silence! Silence!

72
00:05:28,976 --> 00:05:31,680
I now call on the jury
to consider the evidence

73
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:34,951
and strongly advise a guilty verdict.

74
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:46,510
Enough of these lies!

75
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:49,481
Monsieur Madeleine, are you quite well?

76
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:50,506
Call the doctor.

77
00:05:57,585 --> 00:05:59,510
I am Jean Valjean.

78
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:11,430
Brevet! Chenildieu! Cochepaille!

79
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,001
Brevet! Chenildieu! Cochepaille!

80
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:16,921
I hope you were paid well for these lies.

81
00:06:19,176 --> 00:06:20,281
Don't you remember me?

82
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:25,841
Brevet, you've still got those
red knitted braces you wore

83
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:27,791
in the prison hulks?
Yes.

84
00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:35,401
Chenildieu,

85
00:06:35,426 --> 00:06:38,401
your whole shoulder is burnt
where you lay on a chafing dish.

86
00:06:38,426 --> 00:06:39,711
Show the court!

87
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:54,401
Cochepaille, you have a tattoo
on the inside of your left elbow.

88
00:06:54,426 --> 00:06:58,510
It says March 1st, 1815 - the
day the Emperor landed at Cannes.

89
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:04,201
Well, pull up your sleeve!

90
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:19,121
And now, Inspector javert, you
may wish to revise your testimony.

91
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:30,760
Indeed, I fear I was mistaken.

92
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:35,791
This man is jean Valjean.

93
00:07:49,946 --> 00:07:51,201
And now, before the court…

94
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:56,791
…I confess to the
robbery of this 40 sous…

95
00:07:59,665 --> 00:08:02,231
"from the child known as Petit-Gervais."

96
00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:09,430
Monsieur le Maire,

97
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:13,121
will you surrender yourself to
the custody of Inspector Javert?

98
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:16,640
Willingly.
Cuffs!

99
00:08:30,256 --> 00:08:31,281
Follow me.

100
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:35,361
Merci, Monsieur, merci.

101
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:03,401
Will my Cosette be here today?

102
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,760
I feel sure of it.

103
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:10,921
When she comes…

104
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:17,151
…can she sleep in a little bed beside me?

105
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:23,721
She can. Don't tire yourself now.

106
00:09:49,585 --> 00:09:53,411
Just a quick stop, prisoner 24601.

107
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:56,440
Now the people of this town can
see you for what you really are.

108
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:07,871
Take him to the cells.
Yes, sir.

109
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,801
Did you fetch the child?

110
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:37,440
Where's the child?!

111
00:10:37,465 --> 00:10:39,845
Seize him! You, come with me!
Yes, sir.

112
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:44,510
Pere Madeleine, your hands!

113
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:47,831
Let me see her.
She is very weak!
Where is the child?

114
00:10:53,376 --> 00:10:54,376
Where is Cosette?

115
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:01,711
You did bring her?

116
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:10,300
I want to see her now!

117
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:12,661
She's here, my dear, but the doctor said

118
00:11:12,686 --> 00:11:16,121
that you cannot be with her
while you still have the fever.

119
00:11:16,146 --> 00:11:17,630
But I am well.

120
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:19,300
I'm well!

121
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:21,300
And you will see her very soon.

122
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,191
Open up!

123
00:11:28,216 --> 00:11:32,121
How is she, Monsieur le Maire? How is she?

124
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,760
Did they treat her well in Montfermeil?

125
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:40,380
Oh, a very touching scene!

126
00:11:40,405 --> 00:11:41,791
Inspector javert, please…

127
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:45,430
Sister, this man is a
criminal, a liar and a thief!

128
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,351
He has been convicted in Arras

129
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:49,430
and he is just as bad as her!

130
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:51,300
They are the scum of the Earth!
Please!

131
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:59,851
You promised to bring my
little girl from Montfermeil…

132
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,380
…Monsieur le Maire.

133
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:07,151
There's no Monsieur le Maire here!

134
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:09,991
He hasn't been to Montfermeil
to fetch your little girl.

135
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:12,711
He has been confessing his crimes in court!

136
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:15,711
And now he's going back to the
prison hulks, where he belongs!

137
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:34,550
Cosette!

138
00:12:59,785 --> 00:12:59,841
You killed that woman!

139
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:01,121
You killed that woman!

140
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:02,231
Enough!

141
00:13:02,256 --> 00:13:05,151
She's dead, and you're my prisoner.

142
00:13:05,176 --> 00:13:10,151
I advise you to stay away
from me for a moment!

143
00:13:21,455 --> 00:13:25,380
Fa ntine! Fa ntine!

144
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:37,655
Forgive me.

145
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:41,096
Forgive me.

146
00:13:43,376 --> 00:13:47,591
I swear, I swear I'll find her.

147
00:13:49,335 --> 00:13:50,335
I'll find her.

148
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:54,201
I'll pay my life for her happiness.

149
00:13:55,256 --> 00:13:56,256
I swear.

150
00:14:59,716 --> 00:15:00,716
Merci Dieu!

151
00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:41,660
I can't hear you working!

152
00:15:41,685 --> 00:15:43,091
Get on with it, you idle beast!

153
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:11,691
Feast your eyes on my
beautiful handmade dolls,

154
00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:15,171
ladies and gentleman, each one unique,

155
00:16:15,196 --> 00:16:18,771
every single one with real human hair!

156
00:16:18,796 --> 00:16:23,051
What a Christmas present that would
be for a dearly loved little girl!

157
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:31,530
Or if it's wigs you want, or a new
set of teeth, I've got them all!

158
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:36,171
I've got the lot! I'm buying and I'm
selling, I'm selling and I'm buying!

159
00:16:48,685 --> 00:16:50,861
What do you think you're
doing, you idle little beast?

160
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:53,101
You gawping at dolls when
we've got customers waiting?

161
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:54,691
Get those buckets inside this minute!

162
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:57,811
Or I'll really give you
something to cry about!

163
00:16:57,836 --> 00:17:01,660
Don't you fall off darlings, all right?
Come on!

164
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:04,530
I'm buying and I'm selling
tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

165
00:17:08,516 --> 00:17:11,251
Oh, there she is, the wanderer returned,

166
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:13,861
gawping at dollies at
the fair, if you please!

167
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:17,221
Fill that pot and get out of
my way, Mademoiselle Toad!

168
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:19,660
And don't you dare spill none! Not a drop!

169
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:45,721
Oi, you done that on purpose, just
to vex me! You'd better run, girl!

170
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:48,941
Here we go, here we go!

171
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:03,251
Come here, you!

172
00:18:03,276 --> 00:18:04,611
Nothing like a bit of exercise,

173
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:06,491
brings out the colour
in your cheeks, Madame!

174
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:07,941
Right, enough of your sauce!

175
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:12,410
Madame! My horse hasn't been watered!

176
00:18:12,435 --> 00:18:13,491
Oh!

177
00:18:13,516 --> 00:18:16,330
Toad! Two more buckets! Quick about it!

178
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:25,660
Rar!

179
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:41,460
Don't be afraid, little one.
I'm not going to hurt you.

180
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:46,221
Let me give you a hand with that.

181
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:52,485
Here.

182
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:04,276
What's your name?

183
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:09,565
Cosette.

184
00:20:25,217 --> 00:20:28,272
I'll carry your buckets tonight.

185
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:29,297
You show me the way.

186
00:21:04,487 --> 00:21:06,072
Oi! See to them horses!

187
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:11,192
Evening, Madame.

188
00:21:11,217 --> 00:21:14,152
Evening, Madame.

189
00:21:14,177 --> 00:21:15,662
Who are you? What do you want?

190
00:21:15,687 --> 00:21:18,352
I want a bed for the night, a
bottle of wine and something to eat.

191
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,072
We're fully booked.

192
00:21:20,097 --> 00:21:22,462
You can put me anywhere. Put
me in the stable, if you like.

193
00:21:22,487 --> 00:21:24,551
I'll pay the price of your best room.

194
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,576
40 sous.

195
00:21:29,326 --> 00:21:30,326
Ag reed.

196
00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:33,352
Let's see it, then.

197
00:21:36,977 --> 00:21:38,792
40 for the room.

198
00:21:38,817 --> 00:21:41,301
20 for the meal. 20 for whatever else.

199
00:21:45,127 --> 00:21:47,152
Oi! Get him some wine!

200
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:58,462
And what would Monsieur
like for his supper?

201
00:21:58,487 --> 00:21:59,511
Bread and cheese.

202
00:21:59,536 --> 00:22:01,992
Bread and cheese?

203
00:22:02,017 --> 00:22:04,662
He's a fine gentleman, and no mistake!

204
00:22:04,687 --> 00:22:07,272
There's nothing wrong with
a bit of bread and cheese.

205
00:22:08,617 --> 00:22:10,311
Oi! Clear that up! Come on!

206
00:22:18,177 --> 00:22:20,072
All right, darlings?
Yeah.

207
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:22,072
Hello! What we having for our supper?

208
00:22:24,697 --> 00:22:27,672
Oh, are they liking it?
Yeah.
That's nice.

209
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:33,227
Cosette?

210
00:22:41,097 --> 00:22:42,592
Do you have a doll, too?

211
00:22:42,617 --> 00:22:44,592
That one? She's got to work for her keep!

212
00:22:46,456 --> 00:22:49,592
All the same, a child should
be able to play now and then.

213
00:22:49,617 --> 00:22:50,742
Especially at Christmas.

214
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:53,712
Oh, and some people should learn
to mind their own business!

215
00:23:03,406 --> 00:23:04,406
I'll be back.

216
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:13,072
A strange one, isn't he? Oi, little toad!
Come here!

217
00:23:13,097 --> 00:23:14,181
Where did you find him?

218
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:20,232
What did he want with you?
What did he say to you?

219
00:23:20,257 --> 00:23:22,462
What did he want with you?!
You dirty little toad!

220
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:25,631
I'll give you a smack, I'll
give you something to cry about!

221
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,206
Here, Cosette.

222
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:39,487
It's for you.

223
00:23:58,177 --> 00:24:00,592
I have a wish to see the child playing.

224
00:24:00,617 --> 00:24:03,232
And who's going to serve you
Your supper?
You, Madame.

225
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:07,712
I'll buy the child's time
for the rest of the evening.

226
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:08,922
Name your price.

227
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,391
Five francs.

228
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:11,416
Done.

229
00:24:12,697 --> 00:24:13,922
Oi! Go on.

230
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:24,072
Now bring me my supper, woman!

231
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:25,542
Now bring me my supper, woman!

232
00:24:49,897 --> 00:24:51,952
You mustn't mind the wife, Monsieur.

233
00:24:51,977 --> 00:24:54,561
She's got a sharp tongue
but a heart of gold.

234
00:24:54,586 --> 00:24:56,391
Oh! Here we are.

235
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:59,792
The best room in the house
- the bridal chamber itself!

236
00:25:05,057 --> 00:25:06,872
What's that?

237
00:25:06,897 --> 00:25:10,431
That, Monsieur, is my wife
Rosalie's bridal head-dress.

238
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:18,722
No doubt you know, sir, I was
one of the heroes at Waterloo.

239
00:25:18,747 --> 00:25:20,002
No, I didn't.

240
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:22,752
Carried the Colonel on my back
through a hail of bullets.

241
00:25:22,777 --> 00:25:23,777
Is that so?

242
00:25:26,257 --> 00:25:28,002
Were you at Waterloo, Monsieur?

243
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:32,032
No. I was unavoidably detained.

244
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:34,137
Oh.

245
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:40,822
Would you like the little girl
in here with you, Monsieur,

246
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:43,792
for a small consideration?
No need for the wife to know.

247
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:49,282
She has a bed of her own, has she not?

248
00:25:49,307 --> 00:25:51,032
Yeah, of course, just like one of my own.

249
00:25:51,057 --> 00:25:52,282
Then I'll say goodnight.

250
00:25:56,307 --> 00:25:58,152
Same to you, sir.

251
00:25:58,177 --> 00:25:59,282
See you in the morning.

252
00:26:35,857 --> 00:26:37,542
Oh, look at the state of the place!

253
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:41,152
What have you been doing? You idle scrap!

254
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:44,362
Come on, you should have
had this done by now!

255
00:26:44,387 --> 00:26:45,641
Oh, bonjour, Monsieur.

256
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:46,666
You're up early.

257
00:26:49,977 --> 00:26:52,391
There's your bill, if you please.

258
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:54,032
I paid last night.

259
00:26:54,057 --> 00:26:55,057
Incidentals.

260
00:26:59,216 --> 00:27:01,232
23 francs?

261
00:27:01,257 --> 00:27:03,391
We have a lot of expenses.

262
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:06,191
And that child there costs us the Earth.

263
00:27:06,216 --> 00:27:09,112
Cosette! Alouette, as they
call her in the village.

264
00:27:09,137 --> 00:27:12,211
Mind you, she's more
like a bat than a lark.

265
00:27:12,236 --> 00:27:14,102
What if I was to take her off your hands?

266
00:27:17,356 --> 00:27:19,531
What? You want to take the child?

267
00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:23,356
Yes, I do.

268
00:27:26,236 --> 00:27:30,892
Thenardier!
Yeah?
Thenardier!
What?

269
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,211
He wants to take the child.

270
00:27:33,847 --> 00:27:36,822
Didn't I say that's how it would be?
Come on.

271
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:39,211
Now, you leave me and the
gentleman alone together.

272
00:27:39,236 --> 00:27:40,972
Go on!
Come on, come with me!

273
00:27:42,157 --> 00:27:43,692
Ah! Now, Monsieur.

274
00:27:43,717 --> 00:27:45,411
This is all very irregular.

275
00:27:45,436 --> 00:27:48,742
Please, please. I'm not
making any aspersions.

276
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:52,331
It takes all sorts to make a
world, but this is beyond anything

277
00:27:52,356 --> 00:27:57,531
I've done so far. I mean, to sell
a child in my care to a stranger.

278
00:27:57,957 --> 00:27:59,102
You talk of selling her?

279
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:02,661
Well, if we were to part with
her, if we were to endure that

280
00:28:02,686 --> 00:28:06,291
heartbreak - I'm not saying we're
prepared to make that sacrifice -

281
00:28:06,316 --> 00:28:08,972
of course, we'd want some compensation.

282
00:28:08,997 --> 00:28:11,822
I mean, what if the child's
mother should turn up saying,

283
00:28:11,847 --> 00:28:14,182
"Where's my child, what
have you done with her?"

284
00:28:16,686 --> 00:28:17,686
How much?

285
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,077
Er…

286
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:29,461
No, no, I can't do it. It'd
break the wife's heart, Monsieur.

287
00:28:29,486 --> 00:28:31,302
Sorry. No deal.

288
00:28:31,327 --> 00:28:32,692
How much?

289
00:28:32,717 --> 00:28:35,132
Ah! It's no good.

290
00:28:35,157 --> 00:28:37,541
I won't lie to you, sir,
you've got me over a barrel.

291
00:28:37,566 --> 00:28:39,132
You see, I've got debts.

292
00:28:39,157 --> 00:28:40,852
How much?
1,500 francs.

293
00:28:44,927 --> 00:28:48,772
Agreed. Now bring me the child.

294
00:28:48,797 --> 00:28:51,132
Rosalie! Bring the child!

295
00:28:53,486 --> 00:28:54,486
Come on!

296
00:28:55,957 --> 00:28:57,852
You're going to go with that gentleman.

297
00:28:57,877 --> 00:28:59,902
Only if she wishes to.

298
00:28:59,927 --> 00:29:00,927
Do you?

299
00:29:06,717 --> 00:29:08,132
Can I bring my doll?

300
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:10,382
Yeah, of course you can.

301
00:29:15,157 --> 00:29:16,157
Here.

302
00:29:20,566 --> 00:29:24,132
You go and put these
on, as quick as you can,

303
00:29:24,157 --> 00:29:25,331
then we'll be on our way.

304
00:29:29,287 --> 00:29:30,287
Go on.

305
00:29:32,847 --> 00:29:34,541
What about the 23 francs?

306
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:40,612
Here. There's 30.

307
00:30:06,797 --> 00:30:10,382
And he paid up, just like that!

308
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:13,182
Oh! Oh! Oh!

309
00:30:22,047 --> 00:30:23,461
I could have got more off him.

310
00:30:24,677 --> 00:30:25,677
I'll go after him.

311
00:30:29,647 --> 00:30:31,211
Take your pistol.

312
00:30:31,236 --> 00:30:32,902
He had a dangerous look about him.

313
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:35,927
Yeah?
Yeah, lovely.

314
00:31:07,797 --> 00:31:08,797
Are you tired?

315
00:31:11,647 --> 00:31:13,822
Catherine's a bit tired.

316
00:31:13,847 --> 00:31:17,132
Catherine? Is that her name?

317
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:34,902
Uh What are you doing here?

318
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:40,541
Oh! Can't let her go, Monsieur.

319
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,622
You already have.
No.

320
00:31:42,647 --> 00:31:44,541
Not for 1,500 francs.

321
00:31:44,566 --> 00:31:46,622
That's more than you deserve.

322
00:31:46,647 --> 00:31:49,382
Her mother paid you well, and
you treated her like an animal.

323
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,022
You should be ashamed of yourself.

324
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:53,052
Now leave us alone before I knock you down.

325
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,062
Give me 3,000 or I take the girl back.

326
00:32:16,877 --> 00:32:18,852
You want to be careful of this thing.

327
00:32:18,877 --> 00:32:19,982
People could get hurt.

328
00:32:27,727 --> 00:32:31,852
Now, you get home before I change
my mind and blow your head off.

329
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:39,127
Off with you!

330
00:32:55,157 --> 00:32:56,852
Has Catherine had enough of a rest?

331
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,727
She says yes.

332
00:33:02,597 --> 00:33:03,597
Off we go, then.

333
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:40,541
Madame! J'arrive…

334
00:34:46,087 --> 00:34:49,291
Is it true? Are we in Paris?

335
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:51,417
Yes, we are.

336
00:34:53,446 --> 00:34:54,622
Do I have to sweep?

337
00:34:55,847 --> 00:35:00,182
No, you don't have to sweep or
go to the wood to fetch water.

338
00:35:00,207 --> 00:35:04,541
You don't have to do anything
except eat and sleep and play.

339
00:35:06,677 --> 00:35:08,652
Perhaps a little learning.

340
00:35:08,677 --> 00:35:10,622
We don't have to go back there?

341
00:35:10,647 --> 00:35:11,702
No, we don't.

342
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:16,572
And you're my papa now?

343
00:35:20,647 --> 00:35:21,647
If you want me to be.

344
00:35:24,807 --> 00:35:25,807
Do you?

345
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:30,502
Yes, I think so.

346
00:35:35,207 --> 00:35:37,572
I've never been anyone's papa before.

347
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:44,112
Perhaps you'd better ask
Catherine, see what she thinks.

348
00:35:48,207 --> 00:35:50,822
Should we let him be my papa?

349
00:35:58,397 --> 00:36:02,142
She says yes, if you don't beat us.

350
00:36:04,677 --> 00:36:07,182
You tell her I won't beat either of you.

351
00:36:10,887 --> 00:36:13,582
It's all right. She heard you.

352
00:36:17,207 --> 00:36:19,832
Goodnight, Papa.
Goodnight, little one.

353
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:24,582
Sleep well.

354
00:36:56,887 --> 00:36:58,471
Goodnight, Papa.

355
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,112
Goodnight.

356
00:37:06,887 --> 00:37:08,582
Sleep tight.

357
00:37:25,397 --> 00:37:27,142
Are you happy, Cosette?

358
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,832
Of course I am.

359
00:37:30,397 --> 00:37:32,341
Don't you think you should…

360
00:37:33,446 --> 00:37:36,142
…you know, go to school
like other children?

361
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:37,622
Why?

362
00:37:37,647 --> 00:37:39,732
You teach me everything.

363
00:37:41,937 --> 00:37:45,832
What, don't you long for friends?
Someone to play with?

364
00:37:45,857 --> 00:37:47,192
I have you.

365
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:49,622
And Catherine.

366
00:38:00,217 --> 00:38:02,832
I came to see if everything was all right.

367
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:06,142
It is, as you see, madame.

368
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:08,622
It's my duty, you know,

369
00:38:08,647 --> 00:38:11,112
as the principal tenant.

370
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:15,022
Bonjou r, ma petite.

371
00:38:15,047 --> 00:38:17,221
Bonjour, madame.

372
00:38:17,246 --> 00:38:18,732
She's very thin.

373
00:38:19,857 --> 00:38:23,372
I could do some cooking for
you if you like, monsieur.

374
00:38:23,397 --> 00:38:25,341
Not necessary, thank you, madame.

375
00:38:26,397 --> 00:38:28,112
And she's your granddaughter?

376
00:38:29,217 --> 00:38:32,582
Not much of a family resemblance, is there?

377
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:36,142
Well, she takes after her mother's side.

378
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:37,622
Oh…

379
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:39,091
I see.

380
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:43,862
Well…

381
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:46,142
I will be getting along, then.

382
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:48,062
Au revoir, monsieur.

383
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:50,112
Au revoir, ma petite.

384
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,022
Nosy old bitch.

385
00:38:59,657 --> 00:39:00,982
Now, now.

386
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:03,272
You think so, too.

387
00:39:03,297 --> 00:39:05,112
But we don't say these things.

388
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:10,832
Go on, eat up.

389
00:39:30,657 --> 00:39:31,862
Monsieur.

390
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:33,301
Inspector.

391
00:39:34,928 --> 00:39:36,153
Monsieur.

392
00:39:38,907 --> 00:39:41,832
Incident reports from
last night on my desk now.

393
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:44,061
Yes, sir. They are ready, sir.

394
00:40:01,627 --> 00:40:03,472
Here's a curious one.

395
00:40:03,497 --> 00:40:06,602
Innkeeper in Montfermeil says
his daughter was kidnapped

396
00:40:06,627 --> 00:40:08,552
by some ruffian with a gun.

397
00:40:10,137 --> 00:40:12,752
Montfermeil, you say?

398
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:15,321
Let me see it.

399
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:21,321
Am I to go there, sir?

400
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:24,962
Stepdaughter, it says, not daughter.

401
00:40:30,857 --> 00:40:32,321
Montfermeil.

402
00:40:34,377 --> 00:40:35,552
Huh.

403
00:40:36,627 --> 00:40:38,552
I think I'll go myself, Rivette.

404
00:40:39,657 --> 00:40:42,632
And you, I want you to look
into the prison hulks at Toulon.

405
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:45,112
Any recent deaths,
suspicious disappearances.

406
00:40:45,137 --> 00:40:47,071
See what you can turn up.
L

407
00:41:11,657 --> 00:41:14,071
What about that bit there?
You've missed a bit.

408
00:41:15,137 --> 00:41:16,521
Bonjour, monsieur.

409
00:41:17,627 --> 00:41:21,071
Can I help you with anything?
Are you looking for a room?
Coffee.

410
00:41:21,096 --> 00:41:23,071
And I want to interview your husband.

411
00:41:23,096 --> 00:41:25,162
Oh, and you want to interview him?

412
00:41:25,187 --> 00:41:27,632
And who are you, if I may make so bold?

413
00:41:27,657 --> 00:41:29,882
Inspector Javert of the Paris police.

414
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:32,552
Oh, Lord. Well, he's still in bed.
He hasn't got up yet.

415
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:34,112
Go and get him a coffee!

416
00:41:43,857 --> 00:41:45,882
Inspector…?
Mai

417
00:41:46,987 --> 00:41:49,992
You filed a complaint regarding
the abduction of a minor.

418
00:41:50,017 --> 00:41:51,632
Oh, right. Yes.

419
00:41:51,657 --> 00:41:54,112
Thank you for coming
all this way, Inspector.

420
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:55,602
Don't sit.

421
00:41:55,627 --> 00:41:58,071
This child, not yours?

422
00:41:58,096 --> 00:42:00,112
Erm, no.

423
00:42:00,137 --> 00:42:01,632
We, erm…

424
00:42:01,657 --> 00:42:04,602
A young woman who was passing
through just left her with us,

425
00:42:04,627 --> 00:42:06,632
said she was coming back, never did.

426
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:09,632
But you could tell that she was
no better than she should be,

427
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:13,042
if you take my meaning.
Do you know
where she went, the mother?

428
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:16,112
She said she was going to Montreuil.

429
00:42:18,377 --> 00:42:19,802
I see.

430
00:42:21,907 --> 00:42:24,832
And she sent you money for
the child's board and lodging?

431
00:42:24,857 --> 00:42:26,401
Never. Not a penny.

432
00:42:26,426 --> 00:42:29,632
We looked after that child out
of the goodness of our hearts.

433
00:42:29,657 --> 00:42:33,832
Yeah. We loved her like she
was one of our own, Inspector.

434
00:42:33,857 --> 00:42:35,401
Very touching.

435
00:42:35,426 --> 00:42:38,321
Yeah, well, I was one of the
heroes of Waterloo, you know.

436
00:42:38,346 --> 00:42:41,401
Carried the Colonel on my back…
Come to the abduction.

437
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:44,401
Well, this fellow, great
big hulking brute he was,

438
00:42:44,426 --> 00:42:47,242
he turns up one night, wants
to stay in the best room,

439
00:42:47,267 --> 00:42:51,162
drink the best wine. Then, in the
morning, he holds us up at gunpoint

440
00:42:51,187 --> 00:42:54,071
and goes off with the
takings and the little girl!

441
00:42:56,627 --> 00:42:59,352
A strong man, would you say?

442
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:01,632
Oh, yeah, yeah. Strong as an ox.

443
00:43:01,657 --> 00:43:04,682
He handled two buckets of
water like they were thimbles.

444
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,162
Did he say what he wanted the girl for?

445
00:43:07,187 --> 00:43:10,401
No, but we're men of the world, Inspector.

446
00:43:10,426 --> 00:43:12,122
Not hard to guess.

447
00:43:12,147 --> 00:43:14,321
Doesn't bear imagining.
Y

448
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:17,962
All right.

449
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:22,162
That's all.
That's all?
But look here…
What?

450
00:43:22,187 --> 00:43:25,401
What are you going to do for me?
Nothing.

451
00:43:27,267 --> 00:43:30,632
You should think yourself lucky
that I don't charge you.
Charge me?!

452
00:43:30,657 --> 00:43:33,122
It's perfectly clear to
me that you sold that girl

453
00:43:33,147 --> 00:43:34,712
to a passing stranger.

454
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,071
Your neighbours tell me
you were flush with money

455
00:43:37,096 --> 00:43:38,352
for weeks after she went.

456
00:43:38,377 --> 00:43:40,271
You're a scoundrel, Thenardier.

457
00:43:46,147 --> 00:43:47,712
This ruffian.

458
00:43:49,187 --> 00:43:51,552
I don't suppose he said where he was going?

459
00:43:53,187 --> 00:43:56,071
Erm, no, but it looked like
he was heading Paris way.

460
00:43:57,147 --> 00:43:58,321
Yeah…

461
00:43:59,377 --> 00:44:01,071
…I dare say he was.

462
00:44:04,657 --> 00:44:08,042
What did he say about finding the
girl?
What?
Is he going to help us?

463
00:44:08,067 --> 00:44:10,401
You should have got more money for her.

464
00:44:10,426 --> 00:44:13,842
Well, he said he'd, erm…
He said he'd do his best,

465
00:44:13,867 --> 00:44:15,792
but you know how it is.

466
00:44:17,377 --> 00:44:18,712
Go on.

467
00:44:22,017 --> 00:44:24,962
Make his jawline more prognathous.

468
00:44:24,987 --> 00:44:26,632
You see here?

469
00:44:26,657 --> 00:44:29,401
And he'd probably have a
beard to disguise himself.

470
00:44:29,426 --> 00:44:32,401
Just one escape from Toulon
reported, Inspector javert,

471
00:44:32,426 --> 00:44:35,242
but the prisoner drowned.
Did they recover the body?

472
00:44:35,267 --> 00:44:38,602
No. It's assumed it must have
been trapped under the pilings.

473
00:44:38,627 --> 00:44:42,122
It was prisoner number…
24601.

474
00:44:43,627 --> 00:44:45,321
What do you think, Rivette?

475
00:44:46,377 --> 00:44:48,632
Well, I never saw the man, but…

476
00:44:48,657 --> 00:44:51,071
…he certainly looks
like a regular villain.

477
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:55,632
There is nothing regular
about this villain.

478
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:12,071
Merci, monsieur.

479
00:45:21,147 --> 00:45:23,321
All on your own, little one?

480
00:45:24,377 --> 00:45:26,071
Papa won't be long.

481
00:45:26,096 --> 00:45:27,482
Papa?

482
00:45:27,507 --> 00:45:31,122
He looks after you well,
does he, your papa?

483
00:45:31,147 --> 00:45:32,562
Yes.

484
00:45:32,587 --> 00:45:35,922
So what happened to your maman?

485
00:45:35,947 --> 00:45:38,071
She died.

486
00:45:38,096 --> 00:45:39,922
That man,

487
00:45:39,947 --> 00:45:42,242
he's not really your papa, is he?

488
00:45:42,267 --> 00:45:43,632
Yes, he is.

489
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:46,321
And I'll tell him you were
in here, nosing round.

490
00:45:46,346 --> 00:45:49,122
I am the principal tenant.

491
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:51,071
I have a perfect right.

492
00:45:52,147 --> 00:45:55,122
But I won't disturb you any longer.

493
00:45:55,147 --> 00:45:57,071
Good day to you, little miss.

494
00:46:18,147 --> 00:46:21,352
Come on, lads, bring it all out.
Whoa, whoa! What's all this about?

495
00:46:21,377 --> 00:46:23,151
It's non-payment of debts.

496
00:46:23,176 --> 00:46:25,882
I'm taking possession of
this property, Thenardier,

497
00:46:25,907 --> 00:46:29,042
and everything in it but the tools
of your trade.
You can't do that!

498
00:46:29,067 --> 00:46:31,352
I've been instructed by Inspector javert!

499
00:46:31,377 --> 00:46:33,531
Thenardier, what have you done?

500
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:35,762
Look, look, look. Just, erm…

501
00:46:35,787 --> 00:46:37,122
Maman.

502
00:46:37,147 --> 00:46:39,042
Leave some of the chairs.

503
00:46:40,096 --> 00:46:41,602
Go on, lads.

504
00:46:45,587 --> 00:46:48,122
What about the dog?
Tied him up.

505
00:46:49,176 --> 00:46:51,401
We don't need another mouth to feed.

506
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:57,892
And the nipper?
I told him to wait round the back.

507
00:47:00,867 --> 00:47:02,842
Someone'll look after him.

508
00:47:04,147 --> 00:47:05,602
Yeah.

509
00:47:08,627 --> 00:47:10,321
Maman! Maman!

510
00:47:16,377 --> 00:47:18,122
Oh…

511
00:47:18,147 --> 00:47:21,122
Gavroche, my darling child!

512
00:47:21,147 --> 00:47:23,352
To think you nearly got left behind.

513
00:47:23,377 --> 00:47:25,201
Thank you. Thank you.

514
00:47:25,226 --> 00:47:26,792
Come on, then!

515
00:47:35,627 --> 00:47:37,321
Rivette.
Yes, sir.

516
00:47:38,377 --> 00:47:40,792
Any sightings?
Nothing, sir.

517
00:47:48,426 --> 00:47:51,151
There's a woman outside
asking for you, sir.

518
00:47:51,176 --> 00:47:53,962
She says she has information
for you about him.

519
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:15,122
"The crow was too high up
for the fox to reach him"

520
00:48:15,147 --> 00:48:17,842
"so the… so the…"

521
00:48:17,867 --> 00:48:19,362
Cunning.

522
00:48:21,147 --> 00:48:23,122
"..cunning fox began…"

523
00:48:25,147 --> 00:48:27,122
"..tell him how shiny…"

524
00:48:27,147 --> 00:48:28,842
Sh, sh, sh.

525
00:48:32,147 --> 00:48:34,042
Quick, get your clothes on.

526
00:48:34,067 --> 00:48:36,562
We're going to go for a
quick walk in the moonlight.

527
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:47,612
Quick as you can.
Here you go. Come on.

528
00:48:47,637 --> 00:48:49,331
What about Catherine?

529
00:49:04,147 --> 00:49:05,792
Open up! Police!

530
00:49:09,147 --> 00:49:10,562
Open up!

531
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:13,562
Break it down.

532
00:49:40,787 --> 00:49:42,331
He's outside!

533
00:49:50,867 --> 00:49:52,331
Down here.

534
00:49:57,176 --> 00:49:59,972
He just left the Gorbeau
tenements with a little girl.

535
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,802
Have you seen him?
No, sir.

536
00:50:02,897 --> 00:50:05,892
All right, you two, block off
the exit at Rue de la Mairie.

537
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:09,081
You, back to Rue Picpus. We're
going to flush him out.
Yes, sir.

538
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:13,802
Quick!

539
00:50:29,387 --> 00:50:31,411
Papa, my feet are hurting.

540
00:50:33,186 --> 00:50:36,081
Are all the avenues closed off?
Every one, sir.

541
00:50:53,147 --> 00:50:55,081
Papa, I'm cold.

542
00:50:58,147 --> 00:51:00,362
They went that way, sir.

543
00:51:00,387 --> 00:51:02,052
Now we have him.

544
00:51:28,747 --> 00:51:31,081
Where, is he?
Can't find him, sir.

545
00:51:33,077 --> 00:51:36,522
Back! Back to Rue Picpus! Hurry!
At the double. Go! Go!

546
00:51:36,547 --> 00:51:38,081
Come on, let's go!

547
00:51:55,157 --> 00:51:57,132
We're safe for the moment.

548
00:51:57,157 --> 00:51:58,612
Cosette!

549
00:51:58,637 --> 00:52:00,612
Oh, God, what have I done?

550
00:52:11,637 --> 00:52:13,642
You must leave, sir.

551
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:15,882
No man may enter…
I'll go, I'll go,

552
00:52:15,907 --> 00:52:18,642
but I beg you, care for this girl.
Pere Madeleine?

553
00:52:18,667 --> 00:52:20,161
Sister Simplice.

554
00:52:21,587 --> 00:52:23,492
She's Fantine's child.

555
00:52:25,157 --> 00:52:28,642
Reverend Mother, this is a good, kind man.

556
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:31,081
Cosette…

557
00:52:35,186 --> 00:52:37,692
I'm an escaped convict,
wanted by the police.

558
00:52:37,717 --> 00:52:40,842
Even now they're searching
the streets for me.

559
00:52:42,436 --> 00:52:44,642
Police!

560
00:52:47,226 --> 00:52:50,562
Open up in the name of the law or
by God we'll batter this door down!

561
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:54,132
Take the child.

562
00:53:06,667 --> 00:53:08,802
Police!

563
00:53:23,356 --> 00:53:25,562
Open up in the name of the law!

564
00:53:28,106 --> 00:53:30,411
Tell me your name and
your business here, sir.

565
00:53:30,436 --> 00:53:32,802
My name is Inspector
javert of the Paris police.

566
00:53:32,827 --> 00:53:35,772
We have reason to believe
there's an escaped criminal here.

567
00:53:35,797 --> 00:53:37,642
I demand to search the premises.

568
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:40,161
This is a house of holy women.
No man can enter.

569
00:53:40,186 --> 00:53:43,562
We answer to God here, sir,
not to the Paris police.

570
00:53:44,667 --> 00:53:46,081
Sister…

571
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:49,211
…I must search this building.

572
00:53:58,637 --> 00:54:00,081
No, Inspector.

573
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:05,132
No man has set foot in this
convent for many years.

574
00:54:05,157 --> 00:54:06,642
Nor will do.

575
00:54:19,186 --> 00:54:22,612
If you should become aware
of any attempt by this man…

576
00:54:22,637 --> 00:54:24,802
You shall be informed, Inspector.

577
00:55:01,157 --> 00:55:02,802
Please, sit.

578
00:55:10,387 --> 00:55:13,132
Well, Monsieur Madeleine,

579
00:55:13,157 --> 00:55:15,572
what are we to do with you?

580
00:55:16,627 --> 00:55:18,572
My name is Jean Valjean.

581
00:55:19,667 --> 00:55:22,081
You should turn me away, but I beg you…

582
00:55:23,637 --> 00:55:25,331
…look after Cosette.

583
00:55:26,436 --> 00:55:29,411
That can be done easily enough.
We have a school here

584
00:55:29,436 --> 00:55:33,081
and, as soon as she is well enough,
she can attend with the other girls.

585
00:55:34,907 --> 00:55:37,331
But will you be happy to part with her?

586
00:55:40,157 --> 00:55:42,081
It would break my heart, I think.

587
00:55:48,157 --> 00:55:50,852
You are a thief, are you not?

588
00:55:50,877 --> 00:55:52,572
I was a thief.

589
00:55:53,907 --> 00:55:57,081
But that is long in the past.
So I can trust you, can I?

590
00:55:58,186 --> 00:56:01,802
If you take care of Cosette,
I would do anything for you.

591
00:56:03,877 --> 00:56:05,331
I believe you.

592
00:56:07,186 --> 00:56:10,431
We do need some work to
be done in the grounds.

593
00:56:10,456 --> 00:56:13,822
You may have this room and
stay here as our gardener.

594
00:56:14,927 --> 00:56:17,822
And you will be able to
see the child every day.

595
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:26,822
Thank you, Reverend Mother.

596
00:56:27,897 --> 00:56:29,351
Thank you.

597
00:57:48,206 --> 00:57:51,152
Sorry he got away, sir.
He will never get away!

598
00:57:51,177 --> 00:57:52,822
Search everywhere!

599
00:57:53,897 --> 00:57:55,592
He will be found!
