1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,423
I've dedicated myself to pursuing
not only the obvious offences,

2
00:00:06,448 --> 00:00:08,007
but the hidden ones.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,287
Cosette!

4
00:00:10,288 --> 00:00:11,568
I'll find her.

5
00:00:11,569 --> 00:00:14,529
If we were to part with her,
we'd want some compensation.

6
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,009
Are you my papa?

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,969
If you want me to be.

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,289
Marius Pontmercy, my grandson.

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,890
Let me spend some time
with my little boy.

10
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:28,971
Never! He will be brought up
to curse your very name.

11
00:00:28,972 --> 00:00:30,011
Mon pere?

12
00:00:30,012 --> 00:00:33,451
There was a man called Thenardier,
he saved my life.

13
00:00:33,452 --> 00:00:37,452
If you ever meet him,
you do the best you can.

14
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:39,595
This man is Jean Valjean.

15
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:42,853
I beg you, care for this child.

16
00:00:42,854 --> 00:00:44,316
Police!

17
00:00:45,014 --> 00:00:46,574
He will never get away!

18
00:00:46,575 --> 00:00:47,654
You may stay here

19
00:00:47,655 --> 00:00:50,535
but you will be able
to see the child everyday.

20
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:28,101
Look at Marie Claire,
she can't wait until Friday.

21
00:01:28,102 --> 00:01:29,781
What's happening on Friday?

22
00:01:29,782 --> 00:01:32,101
Well, she's leaving, of course.

23
00:01:32,102 --> 00:01:33,982
Oh, I didn't realise it was so soon.

24
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:35,662
Don't you wish you could, Cosette?

25
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:37,168
I don't know.

26
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:39,343
All the pretty dresses and parties.

27
00:01:39,344 --> 00:01:41,766
Dancing and falling in love!

28
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:42,903
And getting engaged!

29
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:44,463
And doing that.

30
00:01:44,464 --> 00:01:47,264
- Jermaine!
- Well, I'm only saying.

31
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:49,904
Look. That's my cousin.

32
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:51,225
Isn't he handsome?

33
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:53,466
I'll be seeing him on Saturday.

34
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:59,289
Oh, poor Cosette.

35
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:01,426
Why poor me?

36
00:02:01,427 --> 00:02:04,090
You're going to be a bride
of Christ, aren't you?

37
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:06,268
Look.

38
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,269
Such a shame, you're
far too pretty for that.

39
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:13,988
Girls!

40
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:15,652
No more chatting!

41
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:04,357
Oh!

42
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:06,220
Father, not too tight!

43
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,878
You'll squash all the breath out of me.

44
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:10,078
Why? Are you such a fragile
little thing then?

45
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:12,438
You forget your own strength sometimes.

46
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,799
Forgive me.

47
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,559
I just cherish our
Saturday afternoons so much.

48
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,120
Come on.

49
00:03:29,928 --> 00:03:31,169
What is it?

50
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:36,202
Come on, speak.

51
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:41,103
Am I really going to take the veil?

52
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:51,485
Well, that's what we discussed
with the abbess and Sister Simplice.

53
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:52,965
Have you changed your mind?

54
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,006
No.

55
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,487
I don't know.

56
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:03,607
I'm sorry, please don't be cross with me.

57
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:05,128
I could never be cross with you.

58
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,569
It's just I've seen nothing
of the world yet.

59
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:14,010
You have seen the world.

60
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,632
The inn at Montfermeil and that family.

61
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:20,971
Lies, violence, cruelty,

62
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,710
that's the world.

63
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,554
I don't believe it's all like that.

64
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,439
I thought…

65
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:38,956
I thought we'd found a home here together

66
00:04:39,494 --> 00:04:42,815
where you could grow up
and I could grow old.

67
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:47,295
And you could grow old
and I'd die here and…

68
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:50,176
…we'd never be separated.

69
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:53,937
I'd be locked away…

70
00:04:56,937 --> 00:04:58,537
…and I don't want that.

71
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:08,138
The police force of Paris

72
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:11,219
has established a standard of excellence

73
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,139
that is an example for the rest of France

74
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,379
and the world.

75
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,092
I call upon Inspector Javert
to accept the medal of honour

76
00:05:19,093 --> 00:05:23,782
for his exceptional achievements
as a thief-taker.

77
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:51,385
It's a great honour, sir.

78
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:52,866
Reflects well on us all.

79
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:55,386
I can take no pleasure in it.

80
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:57,186
Not while that man is free.

81
00:05:57,187 --> 00:05:58,987
Beg your pardon, sir, what man?

82
00:05:58,988 --> 00:06:00,707
You know the man,

83
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:04,107
Pierre Madeleine, Jean Valjean,

84
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:07,348
whatever else he calls
himself now, that man.

85
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:09,108
Well, that's one man out of hundreds.

86
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:11,469
That was a decade ago.

87
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,470
- He may have been dead for years.
- No.

88
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:15,951
No.

89
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:20,590
I am convinced that he is still
alive and here in Paris,

90
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:22,392
laughing at us.

91
00:06:24,472 --> 00:06:28,273
I shall never be at peace
until he is back in chains.

92
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,920
Monsieur.

93
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:17,801
Thank you, young man.

94
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:22,704
I've seen you at Mass, haven't I?

95
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:24,482
Yes.

96
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:28,842
Monsieur Pontmercy, isn't it?

97
00:07:28,843 --> 00:07:30,642
Yes.

98
00:07:30,643 --> 00:07:31,883
Marius Pontmercy.

99
00:07:33,604 --> 00:07:35,026
My name is Mabeuf.

100
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,587
Could we speak a few moments?

101
00:07:55,367 --> 00:08:01,190
I used to watch a poor man who came
here regularly to see his child.

102
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:03,968
It was the only way he could,

103
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:06,328
because of a family arrangement.

104
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:08,090
Little boy knew nothing of it.

105
00:08:08,912 --> 00:08:10,770
There was a rich old father-in-law

106
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,689
who threatened to disinherit the boy

107
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,571
if the father made any contact with him.

108
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:23,914
So, the father always stayed
behind that pillar there.

109
00:08:24,892 --> 00:08:27,693
I'd watch him gaze at his son and weep.

110
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:34,054
Poor man so adored that child.

111
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,455
It's a very touching story, monsieur.

112
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,696
He was one of Napoleon's
bravest colonels.

113
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:48,976
His name was Pontmercy.

114
00:08:54,257 --> 00:08:55,298
Your father.

115
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:04,521
"Saved ten Cossacks and
saved the life of his corporal."

116
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,019
"27 bone splinters extracted
from his left arm alone."

117
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,939
And listen to this one.

118
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,820
"A ship carrying General Guibert

119
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:17,140
"ran into a hornets' nest
of eight English ships.

120
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:21,021
"Rather than flee or hide,
Sub Lieutenant Pontmercy

121
00:09:21,022 --> 00:09:25,685
"ran the tricolour up the flag staff
and sailed proudly past."

122
00:09:27,903 --> 00:09:29,383
I never knew.

123
00:09:35,344 --> 00:09:37,144
You lied to me.

124
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:38,944
You told me lies about my father.

125
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,224
I am your father.

126
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:41,944
Don't talk nonsense.

127
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:44,945
I have discovered that my father
was a humble and heroic man

128
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:48,066
who died forgotten
and neglected because of you.

129
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:50,386
I never knew him because of you.

130
00:09:50,387 --> 00:09:53,106
And I never knew him and never wanted to,

131
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:54,507
or any of his kind.

132
00:09:54,508 --> 00:09:58,907
They were all villains, murderers,
revolutionaries and thieves,

133
00:09:58,908 --> 00:10:00,108
all of them.

134
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:02,531
Traitors who betrayed their king.

135
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,772
Then I say down with the King.

136
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,750
What did you just say?

137
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:19,214
I said down with the King.

138
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:27,191
Young man, I see that you
and I cannot remain

139
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:30,153
under the same roof any longer.

140
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:32,113
Get out!

141
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:34,274
I never want to see you again.

142
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:51,539
Now what have you done?

143
00:10:52,037 --> 00:10:55,597
He… He'll be back
with his tail between his legs,

144
00:10:55,598 --> 00:10:57,540
you… You mark my words.

145
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:12,080
I fear for you.

146
00:11:12,081 --> 00:11:14,080
The world outside has changed.

147
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:17,304
There is anger and unrest in the streets.

148
00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:20,761
What about that police officer,
the one who came here?

149
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:23,162
Thank you for your concern, sister.

150
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:24,403
I've everything prepared.

151
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:14,444
Is it really ours, Papa?

152
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,702
Come and have a look inside.

153
00:13:30,064 --> 00:13:31,704
This is Toussaint.

154
00:13:31,705 --> 00:13:33,264
Mademoiselle.

155
00:13:33,265 --> 00:13:34,744
Bonjour.

156
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:36,904
A piano!

157
00:13:36,905 --> 00:13:38,488
- Thank you.
- Monsieur.

158
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:58,108
God, look at this place.

159
00:13:58,109 --> 00:14:01,229
Well, better apologise and
make your peace with Grandad, then.

160
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,909
- No, I shall never go back there.
- Look.

161
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,044
- Bonjour, mademoiselles.
- There you go.

162
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:12,150
- All home comforts.
- You're disgusting.

163
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,711
Yeah, I know.

164
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:17,222
Right, why don't you get settled in

165
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,952
and come and have a drink
at the Cafe Musain later?

166
00:14:19,953 --> 00:14:23,015
Thank you, Courfeyrac,
you're a good friend.

167
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:35,394
Just the thing for a studious young man.

168
00:14:35,395 --> 00:14:39,115
What is it you're
studying at the university?

169
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:40,155
Law, madame.

170
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:44,596
Well, then, you'll understand
that as the principal tenant

171
00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:48,116
I am empowered
to see that you behave yourself.

172
00:14:48,117 --> 00:14:51,957
No young ladies in your room
except by special permission.

173
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,278
Of course.

174
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,118
Thank you.

175
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:00,062
I'll leave you to settle in now.

176
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,263
- Bonsoir, monsieur.
- Bonsoir.

177
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:17,602
Bonsoir, monsieur.

178
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:25,563
Marius!

179
00:15:25,564 --> 00:15:28,323
Yes. How are you?

180
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:30,764
Here he comes.

181
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:34,964
Large as life, our very own
pet royalist, Pontmercy.

182
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:37,445
Let me introduce you to these fellows.

183
00:15:37,446 --> 00:15:40,405
Grantaire, Enjolras, Bossuet.

184
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:44,046
I have to say, first,
I'm not royalist any more.

185
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:45,446
What are you now then?

186
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:47,808
I'm a Bonapartist and a Democrat.

187
00:15:50,128 --> 00:15:53,448
Now, that's a step
in the right direction.

188
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:55,888
Napoleon was a defender of the Republic

189
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:58,089
before he made himself Emperor.

190
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,289
Well, have a drink.

191
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,010
Yes, have a lot of drinks.

192
00:16:13,092 --> 00:16:18,532
I say down with all nations
and down with all kings.

193
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:20,132
What about emperors?

194
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:25,573
An emperor is just a king
by another name, only worse.

195
00:16:25,574 --> 00:16:27,253
I won't have it.

196
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:29,254
Napoleon made this country great.

197
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:31,734
He brought reforms through his conquests.

198
00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:34,175
What a joy to serve
under such a man as that.

199
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:35,415
What could be greater?

200
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,456
To be free.

201
00:16:38,536 --> 00:16:41,336
I want to be a citizen of the Republic,

202
00:16:41,337 --> 00:16:43,296
not a subject of a king

203
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:44,816
or an emperor.

204
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:50,018
One day we'll all be fighting
to the death about that,

205
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:52,338
on one side or another.

206
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:56,699
And what side will you be on, my friend?

207
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,566
Psst, monsieur.

208
00:17:28,265 --> 00:17:29,625
Monsieur, over here.

209
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,266
Look through the peephole.

210
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:16,495
Do you want to see more, monsieur?

211
00:18:19,153 --> 00:18:20,193
No, I…

212
00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:21,873
Show's over.

213
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:23,976
Nighty-night.

214
00:19:22,684 --> 00:19:26,245
Papa, what was my mother like?

215
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:33,268
Don't make me speak of it.

216
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:41,607
She was one of my workers…

217
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:46,287
- …and I dismissed her.
- What for?

218
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:48,087
For nothing, for…

219
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:50,128
…concealing the truth.

220
00:19:50,129 --> 00:19:51,169
What truth?

221
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:55,090
About you.

222
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:01,113
And after that,
she fell into poverty and…

223
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,113
…she was ill and…

224
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,291
…I tried to make amends,

225
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:12,635
but it was too late and she died.

226
00:20:21,574 --> 00:20:24,535
So, now you see why
I want to protect you.

227
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:31,478
I don't want you to suffer
in the way that she did.

228
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:35,415
So were you planning
to keep me locked away here?

229
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,359
No, no, I…

230
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:41,772
Yes, Papa, this isn't
what we discussed at the convent,

231
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:42,939
or did I misunderstand?

232
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,417
You don't know what
the world is like, Cosette.

233
00:20:44,418 --> 00:20:46,440
You've said that before

234
00:20:47,058 --> 00:20:50,338
but I want to see for myself.

235
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:52,241
I'm lonely here, Papa.

236
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,539
It was better in the convent.

237
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,419
At least I had
the other girls to talk with.

238
00:21:17,904 --> 00:21:19,744
All right, all right, I understand.

239
00:21:21,384 --> 00:21:23,944
Tomorrow we can go
to the Luxembourg Gardens.

240
00:21:23,945 --> 00:21:26,647
Oh, thank you, Papa!

241
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:10,215
Papa, I need new clothes.

242
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:13,175
Everyone looks so smart here.

243
00:22:15,954 --> 00:22:17,434
If you say so.

244
00:22:35,637 --> 00:22:37,059
Papa!

245
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,520
- Now, Monsieur…
- Fauchelevent.

246
00:22:57,521 --> 00:23:00,480
Monsieur Fauchelevent,
it has been quite a pleasure

247
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:02,560
for me to dress your young friend.

248
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:04,161
My niece.

249
00:23:04,162 --> 00:23:06,681
Well, yes, your niece, of course she is.

250
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:08,321
Such a lovely figure, it would be a shame

251
00:23:08,322 --> 00:23:11,683
not to show it off,
I'm sure you'll agree with me.

252
00:23:14,283 --> 00:23:16,804
Mademoiselle, come. Come, come, come.

253
00:23:20,164 --> 00:23:21,205
There.

254
00:23:23,925 --> 00:23:25,907
Turn, turn.

255
00:23:30,086 --> 00:23:31,725
Do you like it, Papa?

256
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:33,367
Papa, that's so charming.

257
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:40,927
Er, I preferred you in
your old one, but if it pleases you.

258
00:23:40,928 --> 00:23:43,407
Men, what do they know?

259
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:45,009
Shall we show him the others?

260
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,696
What about…?
Give me some of those letters.

261
00:25:00,421 --> 00:25:02,381
Monsieur, s'il vous plait…

262
00:25:02,382 --> 00:25:05,501
- Mademoiselle!
- Merci, monsieur.

263
00:25:05,502 --> 00:25:08,525
- That's for you and
no-one else, all right?

264
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,204
Tres genereux.

265
00:25:10,229 --> 00:25:11,749
Thank you.

266
00:25:14,104 --> 00:25:16,703
It's not mine, it's my father's.

267
00:25:16,704 --> 00:25:17,904
Oh…

268
00:25:20,225 --> 00:25:21,545
Forgive me.

269
00:25:24,866 --> 00:25:26,226
What's your name?

270
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,066
Cosette.

271
00:25:30,787 --> 00:25:33,186
Marius Pontmercy.

272
00:25:33,187 --> 00:25:35,947
Well, thank you again.

273
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:38,907
My pleasure, delighted
to meet you, mademoiselle.

274
00:25:38,908 --> 00:25:39,948
Goodbye.

275
00:25:41,668 --> 00:25:44,068
There was no need
to go running after him.

276
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:45,372
Who was that?

277
00:25:45,373 --> 00:25:48,692
Oh, I don't know, just a young man.

278
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:57,990
Papa, what's the hurry?

279
00:25:57,991 --> 00:26:00,814
It's turning chilly, I want to get home.

280
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:36,197
What's the matter?

281
00:26:36,198 --> 00:26:39,557
My wrist, it's sore,
you were holding it so tightly.

282
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:41,238
Forgive me.

283
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:42,941
Here, let me kiss it better.

284
00:27:04,563 --> 00:27:06,882
Why did you get into such a state?

285
00:27:06,883 --> 00:27:09,817
Cosette, you have to understand

286
00:27:09,818 --> 00:27:12,243
not everyone you meet
has your best interests at heart.

287
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:14,643
But nor is everyone
I meet a villain, surely?

288
00:27:14,644 --> 00:27:16,484
No, but there are plenty
of young men about,

289
00:27:16,485 --> 00:27:18,604
pleasant enough in manner and appearance,

290
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:21,724
whose sole aim in life
is to debauch young women.

291
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:23,525
Debauch, what does that mean?

292
00:27:23,526 --> 00:27:24,885
To…

293
00:27:24,886 --> 00:27:26,925
To lead them astray.

294
00:27:26,926 --> 00:27:29,367
Well, I don't think Marius was that sort.

295
00:27:30,093 --> 00:27:31,893
How do you know his name?

296
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:35,127
Well, he told me his name
and he asked me mine.

297
00:27:35,128 --> 00:27:37,647
- What's wrong with that?
- And you told him?

298
00:27:37,648 --> 00:27:39,167
- Yes.
- You told him your name?

299
00:27:39,168 --> 00:27:40,368
He didn't mean any harm.

300
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:41,888
What makes you think you know that?

301
00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:43,248
You know nothing of the world.

302
00:27:43,249 --> 00:27:45,529
Because you want to protect me
from knowing anything.

303
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,004
I'll tell you one thing,
we won't be going back

304
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:48,992
to the Luxembourg Gardens for a while.

305
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,560
This place is like a prison.

306
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,400
You have no idea what a prison is.

307
00:28:18,284 --> 00:28:21,604
Oh, come on, get that down you, huh?

308
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:24,445
Un… Deux, trois…

309
00:28:27,446 --> 00:28:28,565
Any better?

310
00:28:28,566 --> 00:28:30,525
I'm worse, if anything.

311
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:32,766
But does anybody else know
a better cure for love?

312
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:34,847
Revolution.

313
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:40,407
Come on, soldiers who spilled
their blood for France

314
00:28:40,408 --> 00:28:42,047
are living as beggars.

315
00:28:42,048 --> 00:28:44,888
I mean, your own father,
a hero, died a pauper.

316
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:48,728
Look at the slums, look,
look at the children starving,

317
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:51,330
while a fat king sits on the throne.

318
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,576
Paris is a tinderbox,

319
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:56,362
it'll only take a spark to set it off.

320
00:28:58,004 --> 00:28:59,684
That's it.

321
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:03,670
Put your passion into
the fight for freedom,

322
00:29:03,695 --> 00:29:06,455
then once the regime has withered away,

323
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:08,133
equality for all.

324
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,126
We can all take turns
on that nice girl of yours.

325
00:29:13,004 --> 00:29:15,125
He's joking.

326
00:29:17,734 --> 00:29:20,934
I apologise, truly, sincerely.

327
00:29:20,935 --> 00:29:23,697
I have felt what you are feeling now.

328
00:29:23,697 --> 00:29:26,537
An emptiness and despair.

329
00:29:26,538 --> 00:29:30,777
We must struggle, we must
overcome these feelings.

330
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:31,979
How?

331
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:37,258
We could take him to the
Chaumiere at Sceaux.

332
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:41,459
You know, the place where all
the lost women can be found.

333
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,220
- You might even find yours there.
- Excellent idea.

334
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:45,700
We will all go.

335
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,900
You can count me out,
I've got better things to do

336
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:50,541
with my time, and so should you.

337
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:51,861
Count me out too.

338
00:29:51,862 --> 00:29:55,622
No chance. You're coming,
even if we have to drag you.

339
00:29:55,623 --> 00:29:56,663
Gah!

340
00:29:58,783 --> 00:29:59,902
Come on.

341
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,110
Just stop.

342
00:30:58,553 --> 00:31:00,074
Excuse me. Sorry.

343
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:02,874
Cosette!

344
00:31:11,075 --> 00:31:12,316
Cosette!

345
00:31:17,036 --> 00:31:21,156
Do you want me? For you,
I make a special price.

346
00:31:21,157 --> 00:31:22,557
No, no, sorry.

347
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:24,998
Dommage.

348
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,240
Who'd have thought to find you here?

349
00:32:01,084 --> 00:32:03,363
Get out of here,
you good for nothing whelp!

350
00:32:03,364 --> 00:32:05,044
All right, I'm going.

351
00:32:05,045 --> 00:32:06,445
All right, monsieur?

352
00:33:16,337 --> 00:33:17,617
- Kiss it.
- No!

353
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:21,258
- You know you want to.
- No!

354
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:27,178
Oh, monsieur. Kiss it.

355
00:34:05,105 --> 00:34:07,665
I was thinking of walking
out to watch the sunrise.

356
00:34:09,106 --> 00:34:11,217
Thought you might like to come with me.

357
00:34:15,307 --> 00:34:17,187
To the Luxembourg Gardens?

358
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:21,188
No.

359
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:29,869
Make ready. I'll wait for you.

360
00:34:53,113 --> 00:34:55,233
Why this place, Papa?

361
00:34:55,234 --> 00:34:57,385
There's something I wanted you to see.

362
00:35:02,007 --> 00:35:03,475
What's that?

363
00:35:18,998 --> 00:35:21,717
Papa, who are those men?

364
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:26,798
They're convicts.

365
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:29,839
From the prison hulks.

366
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,839
Can they really be men?

367
00:35:37,081 --> 00:35:39,680
Yes, they're men.

368
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:41,321
They're men like me.

369
00:35:53,883 --> 00:35:54,923
Cosette.

370
00:35:54,924 --> 00:35:58,123
I think if I crossed paths with
one of those men, I would die,

371
00:35:58,124 --> 00:35:59,764
just from looking him in the face.

372
00:36:13,647 --> 00:36:15,766
What are you doing here?
What do you want?

373
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:17,158
It's a bit chilly in here.

374
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:18,848
Can I get in with you?

375
00:36:20,048 --> 00:36:21,127
No.

376
00:36:50,613 --> 00:36:52,004
I've got a letter for you.

377
00:36:53,054 --> 00:36:54,525
Really, who from?

378
00:36:55,014 --> 00:36:56,254
My dad.

379
00:36:57,734 --> 00:36:59,055
Give it here.

380
00:37:09,256 --> 00:37:12,337
- Jondrette. Is that your name?
- Sometimes it is.

381
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:20,617
He says your family
is starving. Is that true?

382
00:37:20,618 --> 00:37:22,058
We don't eat often, monsieur.

383
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,581
Go fetch my purse. There, on the table.

384
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,662
Here. I can spare that much.

385
00:37:47,663 --> 00:37:50,818
You don't have to.
He tries it on with everyone.

386
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:52,824
It's for you, not him.

387
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:57,144
Here.

388
00:38:01,385 --> 00:38:02,665
Thanks.

389
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,947
How do you live in this place?

390
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:15,499
I live like this.

391
00:38:16,108 --> 00:38:17,908
Get what I can, how I can.

392
00:38:20,108 --> 00:38:22,980
I go out in the evenings and
sometimes don't come back at night.

393
00:38:24,149 --> 00:38:25,629
Do you know what I mean?

394
00:38:47,433 --> 00:38:51,473
Five francs! A shiner!

395
00:38:51,474 --> 00:38:53,234
You're a star! Are you sure?

396
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:55,698
- I'm sure.
- What a gent.

397
00:38:57,795 --> 00:38:59,874
Merci, monsieur, mille fois.

398
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:01,994
Au revoir, monsieur.

399
00:39:01,995 --> 00:39:05,915
This is too stale for
you now. Can I have it?

400
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:06,955
Thanks.

401
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,520
You know what?
That Monsieur Marius is a gent.

402
00:39:39,562 --> 00:39:41,281
I knew that letter was a good one.

403
00:39:41,282 --> 00:39:42,881
It wasn't your letter that done it.

404
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:46,194
I done it. I told him my tale
and he took pity on me.

405
00:39:47,203 --> 00:39:48,882
He likes me, Monsieur Marius.

406
00:39:48,883 --> 00:39:51,764
- Did he do you, then?
- No, he's not like that.

407
00:39:52,764 --> 00:39:55,004
- He's all pure at heart.
- Come here.

408
00:39:56,565 --> 00:39:58,525
Come here, there's a good girl.

409
00:40:12,573 --> 00:40:14,534
- What have you got in that hand?
- Nothing.

410
00:40:16,808 --> 00:40:19,660
- Come on, open up.
- Show your pa what you've got.

411
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,810
That was for me, not you.

412
00:40:30,824 --> 00:40:31,864
Argh!

413
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:38,771
Thieving whelp. You're a thieving
old bugger! I hate you.

414
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:41,043
Any more of that and
you'll really get one.

415
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,253
- I'm not scared of you.
- Oh, yeah?

416
00:40:48,053 --> 00:40:51,053
All right, you've been a clever girl.

417
00:40:51,054 --> 00:40:53,214
Just don't get above yourself.

418
00:41:00,336 --> 00:41:05,695
Scum, the lot of them, swanning
around in their golden coaches.

419
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:07,696
What about me, eh?

420
00:41:07,697 --> 00:41:08,976
Eh?

421
00:41:08,977 --> 00:41:11,096
Suffering here in squalor.

422
00:41:11,097 --> 00:41:14,097
Get him here. Can you do that?
Eponine, Azelma?

423
00:41:14,098 --> 00:41:15,349
The old fellow with the young daughter?

424
00:41:15,374 --> 00:41:18,483
Yeah, that's the one. You said
he looked like a soft touch.

425
00:41:21,139 --> 00:41:23,490
And don't come back without an answer.

426
00:41:29,741 --> 00:41:31,501
Oy!

427
00:41:32,854 --> 00:41:34,494
Those terrible men.

428
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:37,920
To think of the things they must
have done to be punished so.

429
00:41:39,382 --> 00:41:41,341
Why did you take me there?

430
00:41:41,342 --> 00:41:42,797
Was it because you were angry with me?

431
00:41:42,822 --> 00:41:44,262
- No.
- Did you want to frighten me?

432
00:41:44,263 --> 00:41:46,742
No, no, Cosette, no. I…

433
00:41:46,743 --> 00:41:48,504
Monsieur, Mademoiselle.

434
00:41:49,484 --> 00:41:51,553
My poor father has written you a letter.

435
00:41:51,578 --> 00:41:53,816
Please read it and take pity on us.

436
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,665
- A letter for me?
- He knows you're a kind man.

437
00:42:16,468 --> 00:42:18,160
You have nothing more than this to wear?

438
00:42:18,185 --> 00:42:19,404
No, sir, this is it.

439
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,150
I know the house.

440
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,230
We'll come. Tell your father
we'll be there later.

441
00:42:29,231 --> 00:42:31,382
Pa will be so happy when I tell him.

442
00:42:37,032 --> 00:42:38,247
- Papa.
- What?

443
00:42:38,272 --> 00:42:40,031
I don't think we should go.

444
00:42:40,032 --> 00:42:41,192
Why not?

445
00:42:41,193 --> 00:42:44,553
That girl, I just have
a bad feeling about her.

446
00:42:45,993 --> 00:42:49,393
Her family needs help,
Cosette, and I can give it.

447
00:42:49,394 --> 00:42:51,153
You wish to know what the world is like,

448
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:52,835
well, you can come too.

449
00:43:09,437 --> 00:43:10,957
They're coming.

450
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:15,197
Ah! Douse the fire, Rosalie.
You, light candles.

451
00:43:15,198 --> 00:43:17,039
And you, break a window.

452
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:20,919
Well, go on! Put your fist
through it! Go on!

453
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,280
Monsieur, monsieur, s'il vous plait.

454
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,681
Merci, monsieur.

455
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:34,121
Oh, Azelma!

456
00:43:38,362 --> 00:43:40,602
Don't cry. It'll only
make him more angry.

457
00:43:40,603 --> 00:43:43,602
No, no, no, on the contrary, on the
contrary, bawl the place down.

458
00:43:43,603 --> 00:43:45,002
We want him to see suffering.

459
00:43:45,003 --> 00:43:49,523
You, in bed. That's it, that's it.
Aw, good girl, keep quiet.

460
00:43:54,685 --> 00:43:56,005
Aw!

461
00:43:58,526 --> 00:43:59,837
Go on.

462
00:44:00,726 --> 00:44:02,126
Brave girl.

463
00:44:08,768 --> 00:44:10,847
Monsieur. Mademoiselle.

464
00:44:16,409 --> 00:44:20,208
Oh, welcome, welcome, sir,
to my humble abode.

465
00:44:20,209 --> 00:44:23,529
Oh, and your charming
daughter too, come on, come in.

466
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,210
Come on.

467
00:44:29,282 --> 00:44:31,010
I brought you some clothes, monsieur.

468
00:44:31,011 --> 00:44:33,171
Some woollen stockings, blankets.

469
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:36,731
Oh, my angelic benefactor
is more than generous.

470
00:44:36,732 --> 00:44:38,852
A thousand thanks, kind sir.

471
00:44:38,853 --> 00:44:44,133
No, no, no, I wish, I wish woollen
stockings could pay the rent,

472
00:44:44,134 --> 00:44:47,054
but I thank you, with all my…

473
00:44:52,455 --> 00:44:54,175
Papa.

474
00:45:01,937 --> 00:45:04,888
I see you're much to be pitied, monsieur.

475
00:45:06,697 --> 00:45:08,129
Fabantou.

476
00:45:08,858 --> 00:45:11,209
Did you not sign your letter Genflot?

477
00:45:12,818 --> 00:45:14,979
My name is Genflot-Fabantou.

478
00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:17,550
Of course.

479
00:45:17,575 --> 00:45:20,859
You see, monsieur, all
I have to cover myself

480
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,659
is this chemise.

481
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,699
And my wife's sick, and my daughter
injured.

482
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,940
And six months rent in arrears.
That's 60 francs.

483
00:45:27,941 --> 00:45:30,901
If it's not paid by tonight,
we're all out on the street.

484
00:45:33,382 --> 00:45:35,821
Once I was a respected man,

485
00:45:35,822 --> 00:45:40,663
and then one day, a man came
and stole my daughter from me.

486
00:45:43,224 --> 00:45:47,464
Oh, if I could meet that man again,
I'd have something to say to him.

487
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:51,425
Do you know what I'm saying?

488
00:45:58,226 --> 00:45:59,865
Oh, Mademoiselle!

489
00:45:59,866 --> 00:46:04,306
It's such a shame for such as one
as you to be exposed

490
00:46:04,307 --> 00:46:06,106
to such unpleasantness.

491
00:46:06,107 --> 00:46:07,547
I have five francs about me.

492
00:46:07,548 --> 00:46:09,467
There's people in the city
that would pay a lot

493
00:46:09,468 --> 00:46:12,068
more than that to see you, I'm sure.

494
00:46:13,669 --> 00:46:16,068
- I'm taking my daughter home.
- Don't forget your coat, Monsieur.

495
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:17,988
I'm leaving it. It's yours.

496
00:46:17,989 --> 00:46:22,149
I'll return this evening at
six o'clock with 60 francs.

497
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:24,751
Noble sir, we'll be expecting you.

498
00:46:26,431 --> 00:46:28,191
Don't forget this.

499
00:46:32,352 --> 00:46:33,392
Cosette.

500
00:46:35,152 --> 00:46:37,232
Are you going back there to that man?

501
00:46:37,233 --> 00:46:38,872
Excuse me.

502
00:46:38,873 --> 00:46:41,993
I have to go back,
to get him out of our lives.

503
00:46:41,994 --> 00:46:43,745
I won't let him hurt you.

504
00:46:44,354 --> 00:46:46,193
Rue Plumet. Oui, monsieur.

505
00:46:46,194 --> 00:46:47,474
Oh!

506
00:47:01,757 --> 00:47:03,277
Oh, you're down in the dumps.

507
00:47:04,397 --> 00:47:05,718
What's the matter?

508
00:47:09,718 --> 00:47:13,478
You brought them here, didn't you?
The old man and the girl.

509
00:47:13,479 --> 00:47:15,558
Yeah, what about it?

510
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:17,839
So you know where they live.

511
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,999
Well, I don't know
the actual house, Monsieur Marius.

512
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,231
But you could find out
for me, couldn't you?

513
00:47:23,281 --> 00:47:25,881
Depends. What do I get?

514
00:47:26,714 --> 00:47:28,034
Anything you want.

515
00:47:31,402 --> 00:47:33,793
Well, anything for you, Monsieur Marius.

516
00:47:34,402 --> 00:47:36,843
But he may not live very long,
the old man.

517
00:47:37,923 --> 00:47:39,234
What do you mean?

518
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:42,763
My dad's up to no good. Got to go.

519
00:47:46,324 --> 00:47:48,484
Ah, evening, monsieur. All right?

520
00:47:48,485 --> 00:47:50,484
Oh, if you hear a bit of noise
later on, don't worry,

521
00:47:50,485 --> 00:47:52,565
we're having a little
party for a few friends.

522
00:47:52,566 --> 00:47:55,246
- Bonsoir, monsieur.
- Bonsoir.

523
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,046
Right, tonight's the night.

524
00:47:59,047 --> 00:48:00,806
He thinks he can get away with 60 francs.

525
00:48:00,807 --> 00:48:02,326
He's got millions stashed away.

526
00:48:02,327 --> 00:48:04,126
We'll put the screws
on him and get the lot.

527
00:48:04,127 --> 00:48:05,887
You two, clear out,
I want you out of the way.

528
00:48:05,888 --> 00:48:07,335
- What, her with her bad hand?

529
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,528
Fresh air will do it good. GO ON, HOP IT!

530
00:48:10,529 --> 00:48:12,049
Get off. Go on.

531
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,301
Did you recognise him? Him?

532
00:48:19,326 --> 00:48:20,575
The man who took the girl.

533
00:48:22,571 --> 00:48:24,491
Oh, my God!

534
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:28,411
That horrible fine young lady that looked
at my girls with pity in her eyes?

535
00:48:28,412 --> 00:48:30,771
Her, has to be.

536
00:48:30,772 --> 00:48:33,171
I would give her a good kick in the
guts with my clogs on, I would.

537
00:48:33,172 --> 00:48:35,572
Yeah, well, you may,
my dear, with my blessing.

538
00:48:35,573 --> 00:48:37,892
I've got a couple of pals coming
round and we'll have some fun

539
00:48:37,893 --> 00:48:40,565
with them, and then we'll take his money.

540
00:48:41,094 --> 00:48:42,613
All of it.

541
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:46,495
And then what?

542
00:48:48,515 --> 00:48:50,995
I think we'll have to do him in, my dear.

543
00:49:03,938 --> 00:49:06,009
The Gorbeau Tenement, you say?

544
00:49:06,658 --> 00:49:07,898
Yes, you know it?

545
00:49:09,745 --> 00:49:10,785
I do.

546
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,620
Take these.

547
00:49:21,181 --> 00:49:24,612
Go home, hide in your room, keep watch.

548
00:49:25,181 --> 00:49:27,021
Let them carry on for a while.

549
00:49:27,022 --> 00:49:29,581
We have to apprehend them in
commission of a crime.

550
00:49:29,582 --> 00:49:32,421
You say you're a lawyer,
you'll understand that.

551
00:49:32,422 --> 00:49:35,062
I'm a law student, Inspector.

552
00:49:35,063 --> 00:49:36,814
Well, you'll just have to do.

553
00:49:37,743 --> 00:49:42,615
When it's gone far enough,
fire a shot, in the air.

554
00:49:46,465 --> 00:49:47,985
Are you frightened?

555
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:52,466
Er, I'm a little nervous.

556
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:58,347
Well, everything depends on you.

557
00:50:03,628 --> 00:50:05,148
Six o'clock, you say?

558
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:40,665
- Right, all set?
- All set.

559
00:50:43,455 --> 00:50:46,215
Right, well, I'll warm this up a bit.

560
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,480
For our friend, eh?

561
00:50:55,237 --> 00:50:57,916
Hail Mary.

562
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:39,755
Right, this is it.

563
00:51:43,565 --> 00:51:46,145
Oh, I knew you wouldn't let us down.

564
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:47,685
God bless you, sir.

565
00:51:55,607 --> 00:51:57,086
Where's the child that was injured?

566
00:51:57,087 --> 00:52:00,247
Her sister's taking her to the doctor.

567
00:52:00,248 --> 00:52:02,327
We thought it best.

568
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:05,567
Children, more expense,
they're a hole in your wallet,

569
00:52:05,568 --> 00:52:07,408
aren't they, eh?

570
00:52:07,409 --> 00:52:08,449
Here.

571
00:52:09,449 --> 00:52:12,089
That should cover your rent
and your immediate expenses.

572
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:13,809
There's more where that came from.

573
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:16,689
Paris is not the right place
for you and your family.

574
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:19,811
You should move to the countryside.
I can help you with that.

575
00:52:20,877 --> 00:52:22,837
Yeah, that's very…

576
00:52:23,011 --> 00:52:25,683
That's very thoughtful
of you, monsieur, certainly.

577
00:52:26,892 --> 00:52:29,613
I'll certainly consider your kind
offer, but do you like paintings?

578
00:52:29,638 --> 00:52:30,678
Well…

579
00:52:34,133 --> 00:52:36,613
- Who is he?
- Just a neighbour.

580
00:52:36,614 --> 00:52:41,894
As I was saying, if you like art,
I have a painting I might be induced

581
00:52:41,895 --> 00:52:43,855
to sell to the right buyer.

582
00:52:51,256 --> 00:52:52,416
Just neighbours.

583
00:52:55,337 --> 00:52:57,856
Now feast your eyes on this.

584
00:52:57,857 --> 00:52:59,937
A masterpiece by my own hand.

585
00:52:59,938 --> 00:53:05,258
Depicting Sergeant Thenardier,
the hero of Waterloo.

586
00:53:05,259 --> 00:53:07,690
And where's this hero now, eh?

587
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:16,540
It was I, Thenardier, who saved the
life of Colonel Pontmercy,

588
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:19,220
and never had so much as a word
of thanks for it,

589
00:53:19,221 --> 00:53:21,780
and you were the bastard
that stole my little girl.

590
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:24,373
Seize him, boys! Tie him down.

591
00:53:31,383 --> 00:53:32,943
Gah!

592
00:53:44,785 --> 00:53:47,385
I'm a reasonable man. I don't want a lot.

593
00:53:47,386 --> 00:53:49,545
200,000 francs should do it.

594
00:53:49,546 --> 00:53:53,467
You wouldn't want no harm to come to
your pretty daughter now, would you? Eh?

595
00:53:56,307 --> 00:53:58,019
Is that what you call her?

596
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:01,307
My friend Montparnasse
could slip up behind her

597
00:54:01,308 --> 00:54:03,468
in the park and cut her throat.

598
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:08,229
I'd slit yours, too, for two sous.

599
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:13,789
You dare to threaten my Cosette.

600
00:54:15,871 --> 00:54:17,270
Grab him!

601
00:54:18,791 --> 00:54:20,230
Ow!

602
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,752
You think you can do
anything to impress me?

603
00:54:28,993 --> 00:54:30,313
Look!

604
00:54:39,955 --> 00:54:41,195
What?

605
00:54:42,315 --> 00:54:44,314
Ah, ah!

606
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:45,716
Now do your worst!

607
00:54:57,358 --> 00:54:58,397
Grab him!

608
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,758
Grab him!

609
00:55:06,759 --> 00:55:08,319
Come on!

610
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,520
Hit him in the face!

611
00:55:22,642 --> 00:55:23,842
Come on!

612
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:30,482
Take them away. Lock them up.
Put down your weapons and surrender.

613
00:55:53,967 --> 00:55:55,407
Don't touch my mum!

614
00:55:59,448 --> 00:56:00,807
Attacking an officer?

615
00:56:03,289 --> 00:56:06,808
The man you lured here. Where's he?

616
00:56:06,809 --> 00:56:08,290
- Tell me!
- He's not here.

617
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:15,010
Shame you missed the real prize,
Inspector!

618
00:56:42,696 --> 00:56:44,536
Two got away, sir.

619
00:57:47,687 --> 00:57:48,727
Seen you before.

620
00:57:49,547 --> 00:57:52,026
You're that student my
sister is sweet on.

621
00:57:52,027 --> 00:57:54,259
Gavroche, son and heir.

622
00:57:55,468 --> 00:57:57,907
There's nothing to nick in here,
if that was what you were thinking.

623
00:57:57,908 --> 00:58:02,548
- I'm not a thief.
- Aren't you? I am.

624
00:58:02,549 --> 00:58:05,589
No-one's going to help you, you've
got to help yourself, don't you?

625
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:07,709
Well, I'm off.

626
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,149
Where will you go?

627
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:11,870
Don't worry about me.
I've friends all over this place.

628
00:58:11,871 --> 00:58:13,830
So long, monsieur.

629
00:58:24,713 --> 00:58:25,832
Hail Mary, mother…

630
00:58:27,953 --> 00:58:29,473
Papa! Papa!

631
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:36,354
Papa!

632
00:58:49,917 --> 00:58:53,638
Now, old friend, you and I are
going to have a little talk.

633
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:58,119
And you're going to tell me everything.
