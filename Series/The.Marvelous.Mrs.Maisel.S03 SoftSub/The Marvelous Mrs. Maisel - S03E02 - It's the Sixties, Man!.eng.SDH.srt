seems to get so angry

when you bring one on a plane.

12
00:00:29,773 --> 00:00:31,691
But if the airlines don't want them,

13
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:34,944

You know, th… there's a Bergman
film playing down the street.

17
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:43,035
It's about black death.

18
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,620
Maybe you should've gone to that.

19
00:00:44,704 --> 00:00:47,163
Maybe something's missing from my set.

20
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,499
What could it be?

21
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,085
What could it be?

22
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:53,878
Oh, I know.

23
00:00:53,962 --> 00:00:55,880
A catchphrase.

24
00:00:55,964 --> 00:00:58,049
Yeah, that way I could
do a bunch of crappy jokes,

25
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:00,552
then save them with one
of my patented zingers.

26
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:04,139
Something like "Have
yourself a scoop of that!"

You know, she's always
believed in me, Susie.

37
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,962
She's pushed me to get better and better.

Sometimes off a cliff, but irregardless,

39
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,632
I'm loyal to her for that.

40
00:01:40,716 --> 00:01:42,843
Because, really, if there's no loyalty,

41
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:45,137
what's the point of a partnership?

42
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:47,513
They say if you want loyalty, get a dog.

43
00:01:47,597 --> 00:01:50,433
But even the most loyal
dog will stick its head

44
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:52,769
in your neighbor's cooze
'cause it wants to get scratched.

45
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:55,104
I mean, it doesn't mean
the dog doesn't like you,

46
00:01:55,188 --> 00:01:57,899
it just means the dog
isn't that fucking picky.

47
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:03,112
All right.

-Michael?

-Why were you arrested?

189

00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:46,123
Strong? Where'd she get that?

520
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:48,500
Oh, I don't know. Grandmama, I suppose.

521
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:50,836
-Everything well, Landry?
-Everything's well, Mr. Lehman.

522
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,087
Very good. And Abe?

523
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:55,089
Last time I saw him, he was crumpled

524
00:18:55,173 --> 00:18:57,050
-at the foot of the stairs.
-Oh, he's fine.

525
00:18:57,134 --> 00:18:59,594
-Miracle he didn't break his neck.
-He knows how to roll.

526
00:18:59,678 --> 00:19:01,429
Still blaming the staircase for the fall?

527
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:03,598
Well, the staircase is very
close to the guest room door.

528
00:19:03,682 --> 00:19:05,224
-He wasn't expecting that.
-But he had come up, though.

529
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:06,893
I mean, he had come up the stairs.

530
00:19:06,977 --> 00:19:08,728
It was the middle of the
night and it was quite dark.

531
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:11,189
I… It's the same stairs that
bring you up that take you down.

532
00:19:11,273 --> 00:19:11,446
I know.

533
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,232
Surprised he didn't blame
the floor for hitting him.

534
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:15,109
-It's all forgotten.
-Well,

535
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:16,402
if he chooses to come back,

536
00:19:16,486 --> 00:19:17,779
we'll put him on the ground floor.

537
00:19:17,863 --> 00:19:19,697
He just has to mind the
stairs coming up from the drive.

538
00:19:19,781 --> 00:19:21,115
-Can he handle those?
-I think he can.

539
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:22,491
-There's three of 'em.
-I know.

540
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:24,201
Third one's a doozy.

I've been getting the
same amount for years,

00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:45,889
and now I need a little more?

I wouldn't ask if I didn't need to.

Well, good afternoon,
Mr. Nunberg, Mrs. Maisel.

-Good afternoon.
-So these proceedings

00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:38,055
were originally scheduled
for a couple months from now,

629
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:39,765
but they've been moved up.

630
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:42,226
Yes, Your Honor.
There were extenuating circumstances.

631
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,186
And we thank you for your understanding.

632
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,648
-Yes. Thank you, Your Honor.
-So let's jump in here.

633
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:49,733
Now, I've read the affidavits
and they look straightforward

634
00:22:49,817 --> 00:22:52,796
and in order, so this
shouldn't take long.

635
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,236
Yes.

636
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,780
We need silence from the gallery, please.

637
00:22:55,864 --> 00:23:00,201
And I see no indication that
Mr. Joel Maisel is contesting this.

638
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:02,412
-That's right, Your Honor.
-I asked for silence.

639
00:23:02,496 --> 00:23:04,414
I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'm Mr. Maisel

640
00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:08,459
and I was just… Sorry about the tie.

641
00:23:08,543 --> 00:23:11,629
-Mr. Maisel? You're the husband?
-I am, yes.

642
00:23:11,713 --> 00:23:13,024
What are you doing here?
Are you contesting?

643
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:14,007
No, sir, I'm not contesting.

644
00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:16,843
-Then why are you here?
-Just moral support for my wife.

645
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:18,219
-While she divorces you.
-That's right.

646
00:23:18,303 --> 00:23:19,429
-For adultery.
-That's right.

647
00:23:19,513 --> 00:23:21,431
That's very modern. It's almost French.

648
00:23:21,515 --> 00:23:24,891
But now all this seems a
little less straightforward.

649
00:23:24,975 --> 00:23:27,561
Your Honor, the arrangement
between Mr. and Mrs. Maisel

650
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:29,021
is completely amicable.

Well, they are ready to move forward.

653

The couple before you,

654
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:36,111
th… they were at each other's throats.
That's the norm.

you are something different,

not making a mistake here.

-Quiet!

We are not making a mistake, Your Honor.

659
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:45,329
But your husband is here
lending moral support.

660
00:23:45,413 --> 00:23:46,913
Explain to me how that fits into this?

661
00:23:46,997 --> 00:23:48,623
It doesn't.
Joel, get the fuck out of here.

not supposed to be here.

00:23:52,545 --> 00:23:54,378

-Yes. I don't sing.

Oh, I want to hear more about the tour.

855
00:31:58,054 --> 00:32:00,306
-And to the right.
-It's 18 cities.

856
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,558
And to the left.

857
00:32:02,976 --> 00:32:04,894
And again.

858
00:32:04,978 --> 00:32:07,021
18 cities? Wow.
You'll send me 18 postcards?

859
00:32:07,105 --> 00:32:09,190
-Of course.
-CLAIRE: Arms, ladies.

860
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:10,608
Write down everything you experience.

861
00:32:10,692 --> 00:32:13,569
Everything you see and hear and eat.

862
00:32:13,653 --> 00:32:14,779
[GASPS] No, wait, not eat.

863
00:32:14,863 --> 00:32:16,030
CLAIRE: And change.

864
00:32:16,114 --> 00:32:17,949
You can't get fat from
reading about food, Imogene.

865
00:32:18,033 --> 00:32:18,991
You aren't a scientist.

866
00:32:19,075 --> 00:32:22,578
Now grab your isometric cords, ladies.

867
00:32:22,662 --> 00:32:25,540
I hope your weird little troll
of a manager's going with you.

868
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:26,748
You need a guard dog.

869
00:32:26,832 --> 00:32:28,625
Things happen on the road, dirty things,

870
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:30,669
-and write them all down, please.
-Mount your boards.

871
00:32:30,753 --> 00:32:32,212
-Yes, Susie's going.
-Why the tone?

872
00:32:32,296 --> 00:32:33,505
CLAIRE: And twist.

873
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:36,925
We're on the outs right now.

874
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:39,219
She took on a new client, Sophie Lennon.

875
00:32:39,303 --> 00:32:41,346
Wow, Sophie Lennon, that's big.

876
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,597
I hate Sophie Lennon.

877
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:44,057
Oh, right, we hate Sophie Lennon.

878
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:45,267
I forget that.

879
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:46,560
CLAIRE: Figure eights down.

880
00:32:46,644 --> 00:32:48,019
It was just too much too soon,

881
00:32:48,103 --> 00:32:50,188
her taking on Sophie.

882
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:52,357
I need her full-time.
It's like she abandoned me.

883
00:32:52,441 --> 00:32:54,401
Abandoned you?
She dropped you? What a jerk.

884
00:32:54,485 --> 00:32:56,819
No, she's still my manager,
but I shouldn't have to share her.

885
00:32:56,903 --> 00:32:58,571
So you're saying she
makes enough off of just you

886
00:32:58,655 --> 00:33:00,155
that she doesn't need
to have any other clients?

887
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:01,866
Well, not quite.

888
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,785
I think she only made about
20 bucks off me last year.

889
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:06,871
-Swing arms.
-So you're saying

890
00:33:06,955 --> 00:33:09,331
she has enough of a savings
to have you as her only client?

891
00:33:09,415 --> 00:33:10,875
Well, not quite.

892
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:12,501
I don't think she has any savings.

893
00:33:12,585 --> 00:33:14,169
She probably doesn't
even have a bank account.

894
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:16,422
But going out on tour
opening for Shy Baldwin,

895
00:33:16,506 --> 00:33:18,299
the money's gonna come pouring in, right?

896
00:33:18,383 --> 00:33:21,969
Well, not quite.
It's not even a living for me.

897
00:33:22,053 --> 00:33:24,763
-But Susie gets half, right?
-CLAIRE: And saw.

898
00:33:24,847 --> 00:33:27,223
-Well, not quite.
-IMOGENE: Oh.

899
00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:28,892
But, no, I agree.

900
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:33,104
You're Miriam Maisel,
<i>you</i> should be enough.

901
00:33:33,188 --> 00:33:36,900
Yeah. I should be enough.

902
00:33:36,984 --> 00:33:38,902
Can you move? I can't see.

903
00:33:38,986 --> 00:33:41,237
I had a baby four weeks ago!

904
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:43,406
And your husband drinks.

905
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,490
Feel better?

906
00:33:44,574 --> 00:33:46,910
Little bit. Yeah.

907
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:56,377
ABE: Rose? Rose!

908
00:33:56,461 --> 00:33:58,503
Wonderful, you're back.

909
00:33:58,587 --> 00:34:01,173
I mean, I knew you were coming
back, I looked in your closet,

910
00:34:01,257 --> 00:34:02,883
but sometimes you don't come back.

911
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:05,677
So it's nice that you came back.

912
00:34:05,761 --> 00:34:07,512
It is you, isn't it?

913
00:34:07,596 --> 00:34:09,765
You don't look like yourself.

914
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:11,558
Can I get you something?
Something to drink?

915
00:34:11,642 --> 00:34:13,644
Something to eat?

916
00:34:14,645 --> 00:34:16,480
Rose?

917
00:34:16,564 --> 00:34:19,816
I have just come from a travel
odyssey of biblical proportions.

918
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,318
Oh, dear.

919
00:34:21,402 --> 00:34:23,153
Hieronymus Bosch couldn't
have conjured the world

920
00:34:23,237 --> 00:34:25,781
I've inhabited for the past 25 hours.

921
00:34:25,865 --> 00:34:29,742
-Oh, you had a bad flight.
-I suppose you could say that.

922
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:32,203
My first plane sat on
the tarmac for five hours.

923
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:33,955
-Oh.
-The second plane hit turbulence

924
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,706
that felt like the very hands of God

925
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:38,125
were tearing the plane into shreds.

926
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:41,587
A suitcase fell on my head and
a child threw up on my handbag.

927
00:34:41,671 --> 00:34:44,715
-Oh, your poor handbag.
-We had to land at San Diego,

928
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:47,093
which is in the opposite
direction of New York City.

929
00:34:47,177 --> 00:34:50,137
So, 12 hours in, I'm
1,300 miles farther away

930
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,848
from where I'm trying
to go, and who is that?

931
00:34:52,932 --> 00:34:54,100
ABE: Oh, that's Ezra.

932
00:34:54,184 --> 00:34:56,060
He had an argument with his old lady.

933
00:34:56,144 --> 00:34:58,311
Just needed a place to
crash for a couple of days.

934
00:34:58,395 --> 00:34:59,437
MIDGE: Is that Mama?

935
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:00,897
-Is she home?
-Kind of.

936
00:35:00,981 --> 00:35:02,482
From San Diego, all that was available

937
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:03,942
was a plane to Philadelphia,

938
00:35:04,026 --> 00:35:06,903
so I took that and thought I'd
train from there to New York,

939
00:35:06,987 --> 00:35:08,446
but the boiler men are on strike,

940
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,781
which forced me to take a bus,

941
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:11,866
where I was groped by
a little man in a fedora.

942
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,159
And, I'm sorry, who is that?

943
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:16,162
Uh, that's Mr. Curtis.
He's from Columbia.

944
00:35:16,246 --> 00:35:18,373
Yes, ma'am.
I'm just getting some measurements

945
00:35:18,457 --> 00:35:20,625
for the next occupant, a Nobel Laureate.

946
00:35:20,709 --> 00:35:22,502
Exciting stuff for us.

947
00:35:22,586 --> 00:35:24,713
Oh, I'm glad you're
excited, Mr. Curtis, very glad.

948
00:35:24,797 --> 00:35:25,964
Say, are you planning on taking

949
00:35:26,048 --> 00:35:27,382
these drapes with you? They're nice.

950
00:35:27,466 --> 00:35:29,800
Yes, we're taking the
drapes with us, Mr. Curtis.

951
00:35:29,884 --> 00:35:32,511
We're taking anything
and everything of value

952
00:35:32,595 --> 00:35:33,971
which we could possibly hock,

953
00:35:34,055 --> 00:35:35,848
or in the case of drapes,
make into clothing.

954
00:35:35,932 --> 00:35:37,099
I don't understand.

955
00:35:37,183 --> 00:35:38,767
I'm gonna have to get
some Butterick patterns.

956
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:40,936
May I use that to measure
my husband for pants?

957
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,313
Did the family not extend you more money?

958
00:35:43,397 --> 00:35:45,607
Whoa. Mama, what happened to you?

959
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:47,693
What happened to me?

960
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:51,572
My condescending, sniggering
family was so goddamn awful,

961
00:35:51,656 --> 00:35:53,198
I gave up my trust fund entirely.

962
00:35:53,282 --> 00:35:54,658
That's what happened to me.

963
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:56,702
-I'm sorry, what?
-I gave up the money. I don't want it.

964
00:35:56,786 --> 00:35:57,994
It's blood money.

965
00:35:58,078 --> 00:35:59,746
-But…
-But what?

966
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,290
Well, Rose, we need that money.

967
00:36:02,374 --> 00:36:03,708
We can't live without that money.

968
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:04,917
What's a little blood?

969
00:36:05,001 --> 00:36:07,503
That money was a yoke. Now I am unyoked.

970
00:36:07,587 --> 00:36:08,755
Untethered. Free.

971
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:09,922
I don't believe this.

972
00:36:10,006 --> 00:36:11,340
What?

973
00:36:11,424 --> 00:36:12,967
Miriam, what… what don't you believe?

974
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:15,094
You. Th… The both of you.

975
00:36:15,178 --> 00:36:17,221
You quit Columbia,
you lose the apartment.

976
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:19,057
You go to beef up your trust fund,

977
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:20,600
you come back without a trust fund.

978
00:36:20,684 --> 00:36:23,269
I mean, what is going on with you two?

979
00:36:23,353 --> 00:36:25,563
What's going on?
Did you say "What's going on?"

980
00:36:25,647 --> 00:36:27,106
-No.
-I'll tell you what's going on.

981
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,067
You.
You are what's going on with us. You.

982
00:36:30,151 --> 00:36:30,250
Me?

983
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:32,486
Everything that's
happening is all your fault.

984
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,154
I was very happy being me.

985
00:36:34,238 --> 00:36:36,406
I didn't need to be equal
or stand up for myself.

986
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,741
I was fine.

987
00:36:37,825 --> 00:36:40,118
I have gone my entire
life with other people

988
00:36:40,202 --> 00:36:42,913
making all my decisions, and I loved it!

989
00:36:42,997 --> 00:36:44,372
You, you put this in my head.

990
00:36:44,456 --> 00:36:46,625
You made me passionate and independent

991
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:48,627
and broke!

992
00:36:48,711 --> 00:36:50,629
You're welcome.

993
00:36:50,713 --> 00:36:52,423
Sorry, it was just sitting there.

994
00:36:55,092 --> 00:36:57,886
I think it's really cool
she gave up that money.

995
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,971
Shut up, Ezra.

996
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:07,478
I don't know.
I don't know, this just feels too stuffy.

997
00:37:07,562 --> 00:37:09,480
-Is it too stuffy?
-JACKIE: I like it.

998
00:37:09,564 --> 00:37:12,233
Fits you nice.
I like the tailored look on you.

999
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:15,194
Usually, your stuff's so
baggy, you can't see your figure.

1000
00:37:15,278 --> 00:37:16,821
I still don't understand
why the fuck you're here.

1001
00:37:16,905 --> 00:37:19,448
This was the move-in date you gave me.

1002
00:37:19,532 --> 00:37:20,866
I told you Wednesday the 13th.

1003
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,409
I heard Wednesday.

1004
00:37:22,493 --> 00:37:25,621
You know, your sheets are like sandpaper.

1005
00:37:25,705 --> 00:37:27,998
I'm gonna burn those sheets,
with you possibly still in 'em.

1006
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:30,166
Oh, that reminds me. Midge called.

1007
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,751
-What? When?
-About an hour ago.

1008
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,670
Woke me from a sound sleep.

1009
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:35,713
She said she's gonna meet up with you

1010
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:37,423
at whatever this
party is you're going to.

1011
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:41,136
Great.
So I guess we're not going together.

1012
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,762
Fine.

1013
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:45,932
What? You need her to
hold your hand or something?

1014
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:48,351
No, I don't need her to hold my hand.

1015
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:50,353
I'll go with you if you want.

1016
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:52,939
I'll push you around in
a fucking baby stroller.

1017
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:55,817
I'm fine by myself.
My mantra since I was three.

1018
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:59,403
Good for you.
Hit the light on your way out.

1019
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:01,239
Mm, my pleasure.

1020
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,160
Can't open the door with the bed down.

1021
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:09,664
Can't put the bed up without you
seeing me buck-fucking-naked.

1022
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,875
Quite the conundrum.

1023
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:15,759
["COME ON BACK, JACK" BY
NINA SIMONE PLAYING IN DISTANCE]
