-Nope. I lost.

-That's called rehearsal.
-No.

In addition to the rehearsal talking,

there's been one-on-one,
close-quarters talking,

the hell he's saying.

I don't know if you realize this,

sound completely distorted.

drug-addled piece of work

where Titania killed Oberon
with a letter opener onstage,

with again over Sophie Lennon.

Look, Gavin, her craziness,
if that's what you call it…

It is exactly what I call it.

668
00:26:54,394 --> 00:26:57,063
Her craziness is also her brilliance,

669
00:26:57,147 --> 00:27:00,649
and her brilliance
manifests itself in craziness.

670
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:02,526
And the real problem
here is that her brilliance

671
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,944
mixed with your brilliance,

672
00:27:04,028 --> 00:27:06,029
well, it's almost too much
brilliance for one production.

673
00:27:06,113 --> 00:27:09,408
Almost.
But there is an even bigger chance

674
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:13,745
that the brilliance of you
causing the brilliance of her

675
00:27:13,829 --> 00:27:16,540
will stun New York audiences,
bringing them to their knees,

676
00:27:16,624 --> 00:27:18,249
and make your performance

-Boats sink.

that's what makes them boats.

I've been trying to figure that out.

1019
00:40:44,053 --> 00:40:47,431
I've been missing the
old me, the man you knew.

1020
00:40:47,515 --> 00:40:49,892
I… I thought I could get that fire back,

1021
00:40:49,976 --> 00:40:51,726
I could care about something,

1022
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,728
be involved in something meaningful.

1023
00:40:53,812 --> 00:40:57,357
-You know what I mean?
-I sell bait now, so no.

1024

[ABE CHUCKLES]

1025
00:40:59,151 --> 00:41:01,861
I met some young people in a bar.

1026
00:41:01,945 --> 00:41:04,113
They talked a lot like we used to talk.

1027
00:41:04,197 --> 00:41:06,741
Lots of jargon and mentions of Trotsky.

1028
00:41:06,825 --> 00:41:07,825
Trotsky's still a thing?

1029
00:41:07,909 --> 00:41:09,202
They wanted to start a paper.

1030
00:41:09,286 --> 00:41:10,661
Everyone wants to start a paper.

1031
00:41:10,745 --> 00:41:12,579
-We wanted to start a paper.
-I thought

1032
00:41:12,663 --> 00:41:15,123
maybe I could help
them achieve their goals,

1033
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:17,751
make a difference, but…
after a few weeks,

1034
00:41:17,835 --> 00:41:20,254
I realized they were
just a bunch of idiots.

1035
00:41:20,338 --> 00:41:22,047
All young people are
just a bunch of idiots.

1036
00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:23,924
They couldn't focus or spell

1037
00:41:24,008 --> 00:41:25,842
or form a coherent thought.

1038
00:41:25,926 --> 00:41:27,636
They think "It's the '60s, man"

1039
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,512
is a manifesto of some sort.

1040
00:41:29,596 --> 00:41:32,807
To them, all you have to do is
not bathe, and you're a rebel.

1041
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,892
Well, there we differed.
We always bathed.

1042
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,604
We did. We smelled wonderful.

1043
00:41:39,022 --> 00:41:41,065
You really don't miss New York?

1044
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:42,316
Not at all.

1045
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,693
Have you been back?

1046
00:41:45,612 --> 00:41:47,362
You mean since I was blacklisted

1047
00:41:47,446 --> 00:41:49,364
and my last play closed without opening?

1048
00:41:49,448 --> 00:41:50,865
No, no, I have not.

1049
00:41:50,949 --> 00:41:53,118
Things are different now.

1050
00:41:53,202 --> 00:41:54,953
I have a life here.

1051
00:41:55,037 --> 00:41:56,955
You were such a wonderful writer.

1052
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:58,456
Do you write at all?

1053
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,125
[CHUCKLES]: Now? No.

1054
00:42:00,209 --> 00:42:02,127
Why not? After all you've been through,

1055
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:04,629
-you must have a great story in you…
-Abe.

1056
00:42:04,713 --> 00:42:07,464
I gave the theater all I
have, and it sent me away.

1057
00:42:07,548 --> 00:42:09,049
I know, I know, it…

1058
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:12,219
I was one of the most successful
playwrights on Broadway.

1059
00:42:12,303 --> 00:42:14,805
Every one of my shows made money.

1060
00:42:14,889 --> 00:42:16,515
I won the Pulitzer Prize.

1061
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:19,059
The critics hailed me as
the American Chekhov.

1062
00:42:19,143 --> 00:42:21,520
And then one schmuck
calls me a communist,

1063
00:42:21,604 --> 00:42:23,479
and poof, over!

1064
00:42:23,563 --> 00:42:26,232
My friends… gone.
My agent, my producer… gone.

1065
00:42:26,316 --> 00:42:29,403
Twenty years to build a life;
two months to watch it go.

1066
00:42:31,738 --> 00:42:33,740
The theater broke my heart.

1067
00:42:34,741 --> 00:42:37,994
I wish… there was s… something…

1068
00:42:38,078 --> 00:42:39,746
I could have done.

1069
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,789
What? Get up in front of McCarthy

1070
00:42:41,873 --> 00:42:43,832
and tell him the fruit stand story?

1071
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:45,917
Tell him you were a good man. Tell him…

1072
00:42:46,001 --> 00:42:47,252
I wasn't a communist?

1073
00:42:47,336 --> 00:42:48,545
I was.

1074
00:42:48,629 --> 00:42:50,255
[QUIETLY]: No.

1075
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:51,965
You were a teacher.

1076
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:53,550
You had a young family.

1077
00:42:53,634 --> 00:42:56,219
What good would it do
to take you down with me?

1078
00:42:56,303 --> 00:42:58,639
I would have happily taken the chance.

1079
00:42:59,682 --> 00:43:00,849
I know.

1080
00:43:01,891 --> 00:43:03,309
You know, every night

1081
00:43:03,393 --> 00:43:05,394
I lock up this kiosk, I go home,

1082
00:43:05,478 --> 00:43:08,356
I lay in my bed, and I think

1083
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,109
"Maybe tomorrow when I go back,

1084
00:43:12,193 --> 00:43:14,362
"it won't be there."

1085
00:43:14,446 --> 00:43:16,530
"Someone will have stolen it,"

1086
00:43:16,614 --> 00:43:17,823
burned it down."

1087
00:43:17,907 --> 00:43:19,741
Sometimes I don't even lock it.

1088
00:43:19,825 --> 00:43:21,910
Give the thieves a fighting chance.

1089
00:43:23,454 --> 00:43:26,915
But… every morning I get up,

1090
00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:29,042
and when I walk back up the beach,

1091
00:43:29,126 --> 00:43:30,752
there it is.

1092
00:43:32,171 --> 00:43:34,964
Shining testament to my failure.

1093
00:43:35,048 --> 00:43:36,633
You didn't fail.

1094
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:38,467
Others failed you.

1095
00:43:38,551 --> 00:43:40,135
A lot of those people are still there.

1096
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:42,805
In New York, in the theater.

1097
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:46,600
And I wear flowered shorts to work.

1098
00:43:46,684 --> 00:43:48,519
So, New York…

1099
00:43:50,062 --> 00:43:52,315
New York and I are done.

1100
00:43:55,109 --> 00:43:57,735

one of my plays here?

00:43:57,819 --> 00:43:59,070

1103
00:44:00,655 --> 00:44:02,323
[LAUGHS] Which play?

1104
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:04,033
<i>Pillar of Salt.</i>

1105
00:44:04,117 --> 00:44:06,577
This is a very ambitious
community theater.

1106
00:44:06,661 --> 00:44:08,579
Yeah. They did a rousing
production of Bloomer Girl

1107
00:44:08,663 --> 00:44:10,581
last year, so I'm sure
they're very qualified.

Looks really good.

1120
00:44:53,413 --> 00:44:55,415

picking different women.

-You pick conductors.

These are your children, Archie.

1148

I just thought, since
you're not home anymore,

1149

you might forget who they
are and what they look like.

And this is the reason you
have those three children.

Again, just to jog your memory.

You don't think you're
being a little dramatic?

1153

Am I? Maybe. People do weird things

1154
00:46:08,276 --> 00:46:09,860
when they've been in
isolation for too long.

1155
00:46:09,944 --> 00:46:12,279
You're hardly in isolation.
Your mother's there.

1156
00:46:12,363 --> 00:46:14,114
The kids are there. And, by the way,

1157
00:46:14,198 --> 00:46:15,533
you wrote the wrong name
on one of those pictures.

1158

Unless you changed Eric
to Pete while I was out.

Ha! That was a test.
Thank God you passed.

-Tonight.
-What time tonight?

00:46:33,508 --> 00:46:34,634
I'm not sure.

-Eleven o'clock. Tonight.
-Yes.

down with you, didn't you?

No.

1175
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,067
Better to let her cool down.

1176

I'll deal with it tonight.

00:46:53,361 --> 00:46:54,278
You sure?

1178
00:46:54,362 --> 00:46:56,029
I can hit these clubs alone.

1179
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,614
What fun would that be?

1180
00:46:57,698 --> 00:46:59,950
It's not for fun. It's research.

1181
00:47:00,034 --> 00:47:01,867
Checking out the competition.

1182
00:47:01,951 --> 00:47:03,703
Oh. So no drinking.

1183
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:05,371
Oh, no, there will be drinking.

1184
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:08,124
But sad, un-fun drinking.
