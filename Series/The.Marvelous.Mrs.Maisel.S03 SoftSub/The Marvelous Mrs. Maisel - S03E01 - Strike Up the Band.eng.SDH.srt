00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:19,543
-What do you think?
-I don't have an outfit.

688
00:30:19,627 --> 00:30:21,003
There's one right there on your body.

689
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:23,422
-Everyone's already seen it.
-Then wear the one you came in.

690
00:30:23,506 --> 00:30:24,965
That's a traveling outfit.

691
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:27,218
You know these guys don't give
a shit what you're wearing, right?

692
00:30:27,302 --> 00:30:28,886
They're all picturing you
without your clothes on anyway.

693
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,889
I'm representing Shy.
I have to look a certain way.

694
00:30:31,973 --> 00:30:33,724
Look, I've yet to win
a clothing argument,

695
00:30:33,808 --> 00:30:35,893
-so it ain't gonna happen.
-But it's tradition.

696
00:30:35,977 --> 00:30:38,062
It's for the boys.

697
00:30:38,146 --> 00:30:41,232
I guess I could go
home and grab an outfit.

698
00:30:41,316 --> 00:30:43,734
-Can someone give us a ride?
-I can arrange that.

699
00:30:43,818 --> 00:30:45,152
-Private Lawrence.
-I think I'm gonna stay here

700
00:30:45,236 --> 00:30:46,570
and wait for you.

701
00:30:46,654 --> 00:30:49,031
You sure you don't want to go
home and grab your fancy blazer?

702
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:50,741
-For the boys?
-Don't want to overwhelm them.

703
00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:53,869
Okay. Be back as soon as I can.

704
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,287
Goddamn it.

705
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:57,206
ANNOUNCER [OVER PA]: <i>Susie Myerson.</i>

706
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,375
<i>Phone call for Susie Myerson.</i>

707
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:04,422
Susie Myerson.

708
00:31:04,506 --> 00:31:05,798
JACKIE: <i>Oh, there you are.</i>

709
00:31:05,882 --> 00:31:07,425
I've been looking everywhere for you.

710
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:08,634
I'm over at your apartment.

711
00:31:08,718 --> 00:31:10,094
What the hell are you
doing at my apartment?

712
00:31:10,178 --> 00:31:12,054
I'm getting the place
ready for my sublet.

713
00:31:12,138 --> 00:31:13,639
You don't expect me to live like you do.

714
00:31:13,723 --> 00:31:15,056
Get out of my apartment.

715
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,599
<i>Relax. I'm just taking some measurements.</i>

716
00:31:16,683 --> 00:31:17,809
For what?

717
00:31:17,893 --> 00:31:20,019
You need drapes. The whole fucking street

718
00:31:20,103 --> 00:31:22,147
can watch you do
whatever weird shit you do.

719
00:31:22,231 --> 00:31:25,442
-No drapes.
<i>-It's too sad. There's no feminine touch.</i>

720
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:26,901
-Jackie!
<i>-Anyhow,</i>

721
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,904
I'm here and someone shows
up who wants to talk to you.

722
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:31,948
<i>Who? Jackie.</i>

723
00:31:32,032 --> 00:31:33,408
<i>Jackie?</i>

724
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,201
<i>Who?</i>

725
00:31:35,285 --> 00:31:36,619
Why do you live here?

726
00:31:36,703 --> 00:31:38,455
<i>Let me rephrase that.</i>

727
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:42,000
You don't live here.
Not anymore. I forbid it.

728
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:44,335
-Sophie.
-I am furious with you.

729
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:46,546
-It's rent-controlled.
-Not about that.

730
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,924
-I know I owe you a call.
-A call? You owe me a call?

731
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,468
I asked you to be my manager.

732
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,178
You owe me more than a call.

733
00:31:53,262 --> 00:31:55,388
-Your manager? No shit?
-Never speak again.

734
00:31:55,472 --> 00:31:58,641
I offered you the chance of a lifetime,

735
00:31:58,725 --> 00:32:01,644
and then I sat by the phone
like a virgin on prom night.

736
00:32:01,728 --> 00:32:03,480
<i>Finally, I realized you
were not going to call.</i>

737
00:32:03,564 --> 00:32:04,689
I was gonna call.

738
00:32:04,773 --> 00:32:06,983
So I had to come to you.

739
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:09,194
Here.

740
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:11,654
Below 14th Street.

741
00:32:11,738 --> 00:32:14,157
<i>I had to walk down stairs. I had to</i>

742
00:32:14,241 --> 00:32:16,283
touch a doorknob that was alive.

743
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,452
I had to talk to your husband.

744
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,496
-He's not my fucking husband!
-I'm not her husband.

745
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,872
<i>-Give me a fucking heart attack.</i>
-Christ, my fucking heart.

746
00:32:21,956 --> 00:32:24,124
Well, why is someone
who is not your husband

747
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,376
neck-deep in my fur?

748
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,546
<i>-Can't answer that.</i>
-It's freezing in here.

749
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,381
It is freezing in here.

750
00:32:31,465 --> 00:32:34,551
Sophie, I'm sorry, really,
but can I call you back later?

751
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:36,345
-Where are you?
-At a USO show.

752
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:38,764
<i>-I don't do USO shows.</i>
-It's not for you.

753
00:32:38,848 --> 00:32:40,098
Well, then I don't want to hear about it

754
00:32:40,182 --> 00:32:42,476
or any other excuse you
might be conjuring up.

755
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,603
I don't give a flying merde.

756
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:48,106
Do you understand who I am?

757
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,609
What I am to this business?

758
00:32:50,693 --> 00:32:54,112
-I do.
<i>-And yet you made me track you down.</i>

759
00:32:54,196 --> 00:32:56,740
The last time I had to track someone down

760
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:58,909
was to tell Desi Arnaz
he gave me the clap.

761
00:32:58,993 --> 00:33:01,954
I'm sorry, about this and the clap.

762
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:05,040
The clap was worth it. This isn't.

763
00:33:05,124 --> 00:33:08,752
<i>Now I have been patient,
and I'm out of patience.</i>

764
00:33:08,836 --> 00:33:12,422
I want an answer to my
question and I want it right now.

765
00:33:12,506 --> 00:33:17,219
Are you my manager or are you not?

766
00:33:17,303 --> 00:33:19,512
ABE: Rose, I don't understand why

767
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:21,222
-[BANGING]
-What is that?

768
00:33:21,306 --> 00:33:23,516
-I demand you tell me exactly what you…
-[BANG]

769
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,685
Okay, maybe demand's too strong.

770
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:28,187
I want you to see what our lives cost.

771
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:31,148
I know what it cost, and
you're smoking in the house.

772
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:32,608
How much does Zelda make?

773
00:33:32,692 --> 00:33:34,694
Zelda makes $30 a week.

774
00:33:34,778 --> 00:33:36,612
-Wrong.
-What do you mean wrong?

775
00:33:36,696 --> 00:33:38,531
You can't just say "wrong" to me.

776
00:33:38,615 --> 00:33:40,658
Zelda makes $60 a week.

777
00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:43,077
That's impossible. I pay her $30.

778
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:45,580
-And then I pay her the rest.
-With what?

779
00:33:45,664 --> 00:33:47,364
With the money from my trust fund.

780
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:51,752
You really think we live
like this on your salary?

781
00:33:51,836 --> 00:33:55,214
You really think that Miriam
has all those fabulous clothes

782
00:33:55,298 --> 00:33:57,133
because you were a professor at Columbia?

783
00:33:57,217 --> 00:34:00,970
The vacations, the
dinners, the cocktail parties

784
00:34:01,054 --> 00:34:02,680
you think all that exists

785
00:34:02,764 --> 00:34:04,974
because you taught
eight hyper-intelligent,

786
00:34:05,058 --> 00:34:07,894
emotionally-retarded eunuchs
to draw symbols on a chalkboard.

787
00:34:07,978 --> 00:34:09,979
I think you're
oversimplifying my classes.

788
00:34:10,063 --> 00:34:12,690
Do you know one other
professor who lives the way we do?

789
00:34:12,774 --> 00:34:15,776
-Milk is 49 cents a gallon?
-Not one.

790
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,945
They all have drab clothes
and gray skin and they die young.

791
00:34:19,029 --> 00:34:22,115
You're telling me that you
paid for all of these things

792
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,950
-out of your trust fund?
-Yes.

793
00:34:24,034 --> 00:34:26,036
You told me that trust
fund was just there

794
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,245
to buy me birthday presents.

795
00:34:27,329 --> 00:34:28,580
Well, happy fucking birthday, Abe.

796
00:34:28,664 --> 00:34:30,764
Now cut the crap and
go get our lives back.

797
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:33,168
This is ridiculous.

798
00:34:33,252 --> 00:34:36,171
All this talk is about

799
00:34:36,255 --> 00:34:37,923
possessions and things.

800
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:40,634
I mean, look at this apartment.

801
00:34:40,718 --> 00:34:42,427
Who needs all these rooms?

802
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:44,137
A living room, a dining room,

803
00:34:44,221 --> 00:34:46,431
a kitchen, two bathrooms.

804
00:34:46,515 --> 00:34:48,475
I have a room, you have a room,

805
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:50,769
Miriam has a room, her
children have a room.

806
00:34:50,853 --> 00:34:53,688
And the coup de grâce: this whole room

807
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:55,774
is for our daughter's clothes.

808
00:34:55,858 --> 00:34:59,402
Clothes and clothes

809
00:34:59,486 --> 00:35:01,321
and more clothes and…

810
00:35:01,405 --> 00:35:05,450
I was never a materialistic man, Rose.

811
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:08,620
I cared about science and thought

812
00:35:08,704 --> 00:35:11,206
and bettering mankind. Now look at me.

813
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,041
I'm wearing two sweaters.

814
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:16,503
Rose, tell me, when did I become a man

815
00:35:16,587 --> 00:35:19,506
who needs five bedrooms?

816
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,425
When did I become a man
who… who needs a linen closet?

817
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:25,678
When did I become a man who has a maid?

818
00:35:25,762 --> 00:35:27,721
When did I change?

819
00:35:27,805 --> 00:35:29,640
When did I become this selfish,

820
00:35:29,724 --> 00:35:31,976
materialistic man?

821
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,020
Th… The kind of man I used to despise.

822
00:35:35,104 --> 00:35:37,564
-When you married me.
-I didn't say that!

823
00:35:37,648 --> 00:35:38,857
Hi, it's me!

824
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:41,235
I just have to change
and get back to the airfield.

825
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:42,569
Hey, what happened to my clothes?

826
00:35:42,653 --> 00:35:44,613
Have you worn all these dresses?

827
00:35:44,697 --> 00:35:46,156
-Have I…
-Because I don't think

828
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,535
you've been on Earth long
enough even at a rate of two per day.

829
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,371
-Okay, what is happening?
-What do you mean, "What is happening"?

830
00:35:52,455 --> 00:35:54,039
-Have you not been paying attention?
-She never pays attention.

831
00:35:54,123 --> 00:35:55,374
Our whole lives are
going down the toilet.

832
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,710
-Where the hell have you been?
-She's been out.

833
00:35:57,794 --> 00:35:59,211
Doing whatever it is she does at night.

834
00:35:59,295 --> 00:36:00,963
Oh, and I suppose that's my fault, too.

835
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:02,965
-You know what I'm doing at night.
-If you hadn't met me,

836
00:36:03,049 --> 00:36:04,174
then I wouldn't be Miriam's mother

837
00:36:04,258 --> 00:36:05,843
and she wouldn't be
turning to prostitution

838
00:36:05,927 --> 00:36:08,053
-instead of being married.
-I am not a prostitute. I'm a comic.

839
00:36:08,137 --> 00:36:10,806
-Is there a difference?
-Yes, prostitutes get paid more.

840
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,016
Hilarious.

841
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,351
-You should go into comedy.
-I did.

842
00:36:14,435 --> 00:36:16,770
I can't deal with you now.
I have enough to worry about.

843
00:36:16,854 --> 00:36:18,230
Yes. You have to figure
out where we're gonna live.

844
00:36:18,314 --> 00:36:19,314
-Okay.
-How we're gonna pay for it.

845
00:36:19,398 --> 00:36:20,941
-Enough.
-And the going rate of Zelda.

846
00:36:21,025 --> 00:36:23,067
-So you took it out on my clothes?
-He saved you the trouble.

847
00:36:23,151 --> 00:36:25,069
You have to move them
anyway because this is not

848
00:36:25,153 --> 00:36:25,963
our home anymore.

849
00:36:26,047 --> 00:36:28,281
It was never ours.
Columbia always owned it.

850
00:36:28,365 --> 00:36:29,866
We would've had to move eventually.

851
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,285
-Yes, when we died.
-Still, a deadline.

852
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:33,703
-Oh.
-Blue dress, blue dress.

853
00:36:33,787 --> 00:36:36,414
-What are you doing?
-I need a dress for tonight.

854
00:36:36,498 --> 00:36:38,958
You see? Selfish.
That's the daughter that we raised.

855
