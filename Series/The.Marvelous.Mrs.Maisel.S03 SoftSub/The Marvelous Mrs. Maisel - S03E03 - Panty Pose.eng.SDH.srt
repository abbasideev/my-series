It's a schedule for Ethan and Esther.

-MIDGE: Now, each time

new recipient, please bring

00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:23,805

-Let's keep things constructive here.

-As it should be.

"Weekends." That's the word.

363
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:38,821
I was wondering why

377

You don't have a place to live right now.
As soon as you do…

383
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:16,861
So your going off to be a comedian

384
00:13:16,945 --> 00:13:18,530
means I don't get to
see my grandchildren.

385

Mama, no.

-Whoops. My mother just said that.
-Yep. [CHUCKLES]

397
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,304
ABE: Because "penis" is a funny word.

398
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,181
I've learned this about comedians:

399
00:13:43,265 --> 00:13:46,143
-they say funny words for cheap laughs.
-Guys, please.

400
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:48,478
If you had a penis, she'd
be talking about you, not me.

401
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:52,232
Wouldn't you talk about your
mother's penis if she had one?

402
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:54,359

It's the answer to all your problems.

You live in a one-bedroom

the word next to pineapple?

-[OVERLAPPING CHATTER]
-About that crack.

-About the "oompah."
-The first part.
