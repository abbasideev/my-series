So, I'll take him, you pick him up?

84
00:03:02,529 --> 00:03:05,282

-Because… Queens.

88
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:12,665
or he won't live up to his potential.

89
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:13,916
They say he's advanced.

00:03:22,843 --> 00:03:24,344
They said he shows promise.

96
00:03:24,428 --> 00:03:25,595
-"Promise" I can buy.
-But, Joel,

97
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:27,681
"promise" can turn into
potential at Collegiate.

98
00:03:27,765 --> 00:03:30,141
If he goes to Queens
U, "promise" turns into,

99
00:03:30,225 --> 00:03:32,269
"Move it, pal, forklift coming through."

100
00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:33,896
First of all, if he gets
into Queens U at five,

101
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,272
he's definitely advanced.

102
00:03:35,356 --> 00:03:37,483
And second, I'm not the bad guy here.

103
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,568

of the factory soon or it's just weird.

105
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,155
I should find an
apartment close to the club,

106
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:45,283
so we can put him in
a school in Chinatown

107
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:47,202
if we want him to be
behind in two languages.

108
00:03:47,286 --> 00:03:48,912
His grandparents live in Queens.

109
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,373
Both sets. And somebody
should be with the kids at night.

110
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:53,208

to open the club, right?

111
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:54,835
-Great timing.
-Hey.

112
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,294
Sorry about the timing,
but if you remember,

113
00:03:56,378 --> 00:03:58,463
you were supposed to be in the
homestretch of your tour by now.

114
00:03:58,547 --> 00:04:01,300
No one told me to add two months
so Shy could have a breakdown.

115
00:04:01,384 --> 00:04:03,720
It wasn't a breakdown. He was exhausted.

116
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:05,513
And if Ethan goes to school in Queens

117
00:04:05,597 --> 00:04:07,140
and later finds out
he got into Collegiate,

118
00:04:07,224 --> 00:04:08,433
he will hold it against us.

119
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:10,893
-We won't tell him.
-Someday he will date a girl

whose father is the head
of Collegiate admissions,

121
00:04:12,522 --> 00:04:13,522
and he will mention that they were

122
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:14,690
very disappointed that we didn't

123
00:04:14,774 --> 00:04:15,941
put him in when he got accepted,

124
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:17,609
and then we won't be
invited to the wedding.

125
00:04:17,693 --> 00:04:19,528
How's he gonna meet this girl?
He'll be in Queens.

126
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:20,571
He'll go into the city.

127
00:04:20,655 --> 00:04:21,989
-We won't let him.
-He'll find a way.

128
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:23,115
We won't tell him there's a city.

129
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,241
You don't think he's
gonna know there's a city?

130
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:26,244
-Won't he read?
-He goes to school in Queens.

00:04:26,328 --> 00:04:27,412

147
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,160
No, no. He's done nothing, I swear.

148
00:05:05,244 --> 00:05:07,997

Poconos every year for Christmas

150

-Your mother knows her. Anyhow.
-Oh, good.

Her daughter… very bright,
like you; very tall, like you.

865
00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:30,611
She used to look terrible,
but now she's beautiful,

866
00:31:30,695 --> 00:31:33,030
though still very clumsy,
which I think will work nicely

867
00:31:33,114 --> 00:31:35,616
because it's a little weird.
Get it? Weird?

868
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,659
Rose, it is very sweet
of you to think about this,

-I can be right again.
-Rose, I promise you, I'm fine.

You know, you won't be
this handsome forever.

Well,

that would prove otherwise.

Judy's daughter's clever, too.

I know I'm right about this.

What happened to you?

The most wonderful thing.

Wonderful? Your nose is bleeding.

897

A man threw a tomato at me.

898

-He what?
-Three tomatoes, actually.

899
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:02,876
He threw three tomatoes
at me point blank.

900

-Abe…
-I gave him a chance to apologize.

901
00:33:05,046 --> 00:33:07,381
-He didn't take it, so I pushed him.
-You what?

902
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:10,759
I physically put my two hands
on his chest and pushed him.

903
00:33:10,843 --> 00:33:12,803
And then, he pushed me
back, so I pushed him back.

904
00:33:12,887 --> 00:33:14,680
And then he pushed me
back, and before I knew it,

905
00:33:14,764 --> 00:33:16,390
we were fighting! Well, sort of.

906
00:33:16,474 --> 00:33:19,603
It was more of a freeform
grapple than actual fisticuffs,

907
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:22,188
but we scuffled like
dandies, and fell in the street.

908
00:33:22,272 --> 00:33:24,024
We almost got hit by a garbage truck,

909
00:33:24,108 --> 00:33:25,400
but it was going very slowly,

910
00:33:25,484 --> 00:33:27,611
so we managed to roll out of the way.

911
00:33:27,695 --> 00:33:30,030
Abe, this is terrible.
You were assaulted by a stranger.

912
00:33:30,114 --> 00:33:32,533
No, Rose, not a stranger.

David Merrick? Who is that, a gangster?

915
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:37,914
Kind of. He's a Broadway producer.

916
00:33:37,998 --> 00:33:40,291
And, Rose… he read it.

917
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:43,961
David Merrick read my
piece, and he despised it.

918
00:33:44,045 --> 00:33:45,546

00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,591

people who make a living sitting down.

927
00:34:01,314 --> 00:34:03,066
It incited them to get up

928
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,068
and commit an act of physical violence!

929
00:34:05,152 --> 00:34:07,654
Abe, I think this must have
been a very underripe tomato,

930
00:34:07,738 --> 00:34:09,864
and it hit you in the head.
You are possibly concussed.

931
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:13,243
No. Rose, it was a perfectly
ripe, beautiful tomato.

932
00:34:13,327 --> 00:34:15,037
It would have made a wonderful salad.

933

You know, when we first started dating,

Archie would sit outside
my house for hours.

because, you know, he's Archie.

1038
00:38:46,287 --> 00:38:48,622
Cut out me.
Yeah, that's probably the best idea.

-Susie…

1040
00:38:48,939 --> 00:38:50,666
-I'll transfer all the money
that she's made so far.

1041
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,961
Every penny.
I just need a little time to get it all

1042
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:55,963
organized, but I will get it to you,

1043
00:38:56,047 --> 00:38:58,257
and then, once a week,
I will send you a check.

1044

Once a week,

00:39:00,218 --> 00:39:01,511
-someone will send you a check.
-Hold on.

1046
00:39:01,595 --> 00:39:03,763
So… thanks for the drinks.

1047
00:39:03,847 --> 00:39:05,890
Mm.

1048
00:39:05,974 --> 00:39:08,268
-We'll talk more later.
-Susie, stop.

and a lot of other people
who are trained to do this.

1053
00:39:17,737 --> 00:39:19,571

have a team of people

-'Cause you love her!

What, that I'll love her forever?

1060
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:36,720
No, about the money.
She knows the other shit. Everybody does.

The first moment I saw Midge Maisel,

I thought, "That is one
red-hot cocktail waitress."

1067

French-restaurant-level

1068

When I found out she was a comic,

1069
00:40:01,659 --> 00:40:03,327
you could have knocked
me over with a feather.

00:40:03,411 --> 00:40:04,911

a tour with Shy Baldwin.

a red-hot cocktail waitress…

I'd definitely exceed
my two-drink minimum.

I work in a hospital, Miriam.
I perform surgery.

1130
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:07,960
I hold really sharp tools
that I cut people open with.

00:42:08,044 --> 00:42:10,337

incorrectly, they tend to die.

Hometown crowds… they love you the most,

1375
00:52:48,689 --> 00:52:50,023
but they also give you the most shit

1376
00:52:50,107 --> 00:52:51,358
when you aren't on your best game.

1377
00:52:51,442 --> 00:52:53,361
Oh, I know.
If I step up to my butcher counter

1378
00:52:53,445 --> 00:52:55,113
and I haven't decided
four or six lamb chops,

1379
00:52:55,197 --> 00:52:56,531
I get eviscerated.

1380
00:52:56,615 --> 00:52:58,700
I wind up getting cube
steak out of pure intimidation.

1381
00:52:58,784 --> 00:53:00,702
Yeah, it's nothing like
that, but thanks for sharing.

1382
00:53:00,786 --> 00:53:02,328
Hey, have another cookie.

1383
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:03,955
-Sorry, pal.
-Shit.

1384
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:07,084
Ella! Are those your meatloaf
sandwiches I see there?

1385
00:53:07,168 --> 00:53:09,295
-Yes. [GIGGLES]
-Mmm!

1386
00:53:09,379 --> 00:53:11,213
[KNOCKING]

1387
00:53:11,297 --> 00:53:13,632
Oh, so that's where you've
been for the last two months.

1388
00:53:13,716 --> 00:53:16,385
Get in here, Little Miss Mouthy!

1389
00:53:16,469 --> 00:53:19,639
Mr. Baldwin, you look
like a million bucks.

1390
00:53:19,723 --> 00:53:21,474
Oh, no, my price has gone way up.

1391
00:53:21,558 --> 00:53:24,144
-[LAUGHS]
-[CHUCKLES] Oh.

1392
00:53:24,228 --> 00:53:26,313
Back up, now. Let me see that dress.

1393
00:53:26,397 --> 00:53:27,898
I thought I'd go understated today,

1394
00:53:27,982 --> 00:53:28,982
try to blend in.

1395
00:53:29,066 --> 00:53:31,067
In that? Nice try.

1396
00:53:31,151 --> 00:53:33,070
It's so good to see you.

1397
00:53:33,154 --> 00:53:34,322
You, too.

1398
00:53:34,406 --> 00:53:35,656
Get yourself some champagne.

1399
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:36,741
You want some?

1400
00:53:36,825 --> 00:53:39,077
Not before the show.

1401
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:43,414
You know, I tried to
call you a few times,

1402
00:53:43,498 --> 00:53:45,833
but you got that
housekeeper, General Patton.

1403
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:48,337
Yes. You'd think after helping
save the world from Hitler,

1404
00:53:48,421 --> 00:53:49,838
he could get a better gig.

1405
00:53:49,922 --> 00:53:51,548
Bet you can bounce a quarter off your bed

1406
00:53:51,632 --> 00:53:52,799
when he makes it though.

1407
00:53:52,883 --> 00:53:54,635
So, tell me what you've been up to.

1408
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:56,970
Well, I've been living in Queens.

1409
00:53:57,054 --> 00:53:58,597
Doing some radio work.

1410
00:53:58,681 --> 00:54:01,351
Got paid in feminine
products and pancake syrup.

1411
00:54:01,435 --> 00:54:02,685
My nephew had his bris.

1412
00:54:02,769 --> 00:54:03,895
He had his what?

1413
00:54:03,979 --> 00:54:04,979
It's where they cut off your penis

1414
00:54:05,063 --> 00:54:06,147
and then we all eat deli.

1415
00:54:06,231 --> 00:54:08,149
It's time for both of us
to get back on the road.

1416
00:54:08,233 --> 00:54:09,776
-[CHEERING IN DISTANCE]
-Wow.

1417
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,110
Someone's killing.

1418
00:54:11,194 --> 00:54:12,362
Must be Moms.

1419
00:54:12,446 --> 00:54:14,365
Moms… Mabley?

1420
00:54:14,449 --> 00:54:16,283
Are you serious?

1421
00:54:16,367 --> 00:54:17,284
Where you going?

1422
00:54:17,368 --> 00:54:18,619
Moms Mabley's onstage.

1423
00:54:18,703 --> 00:54:19,787
Shy Baldwin's right here.

1424
00:54:19,871 --> 00:54:20,955
What happened to our reunion?

1425
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:22,331
Well, you look good, you feel good,

1426
00:54:22,415 --> 00:54:23,749
you liked my dress. You need some tea?

1427
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:24,959
-I got some tea.
-See ya.

1428
00:54:25,043 --> 00:54:26,543
You are a fickle girl.

1429
00:54:26,627 --> 00:54:28,380
I've been called so much worse.

1430
00:54:28,464 --> 00:54:29,923
[LAUGHTER IN DISTANCE]

1431
00:54:30,007 --> 00:54:32,550
They even said I was prejudiced.

1432
00:54:32,634 --> 00:54:34,552
I'm not prejudiced.

1433
00:54:34,636 --> 00:54:37,013
I'm not.

1434
00:54:37,097 --> 00:54:40,267
But I don't like no old man.

1435
00:54:40,351 --> 00:54:43,354
I don't give a damn what color he is.

1436
00:54:43,438 --> 00:54:45,648
-[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]
-Yeah.

1437
00:54:45,732 --> 00:54:48,401
Moms likes 'em young, baby.

1438
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:51,195
-[LAUGHTER]
-What about it?

1439
00:54:51,279 --> 00:54:53,698
Can't no old man do nothing for me

1440
00:54:53,782 --> 00:54:56,326
but bring me a message from a young man.

1441
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:57,911
[LAUGHTER]

1442
00:54:57,995 --> 00:55:00,580
-That's all he can do.
-[APPLAUSE]

1443
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:04,502
I don't want nothing
old but some old money.

1444
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:08,756
I married an old man

1445
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,259
when I was nothing but a child.

1446
00:55:11,343 --> 00:55:13,136
Nothing but a child.

1447
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,096
15 years old.

1448
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:18,433
-WOMAN: That ain't right.
-That was the curse back in my day.

1449
00:55:18,517 --> 00:55:22,688
You had to marry who your
parents picked out for you.

1450
00:55:22,772 --> 00:55:25,774
My daddy picked out this old man,

1451
00:55:25,858 --> 00:55:28,527
old man.

1452
00:55:28,611 --> 00:55:31,196
My daddy liked him.

1453
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,907
My daddy should've married him.

1454
00:55:33,991 --> 00:55:36,036
[LAUGHTER]

1455
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,455
They say

1456
00:55:38,539 --> 00:55:43,001
you shouldn't say nothing
about the dead unless it's good.

1457
00:55:43,085 --> 00:55:45,670
He's dead.

1458
00:55:45,754 --> 00:55:47,422
That's good.

1459
00:55:47,506 --> 00:55:49,175
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

1460
00:55:49,259 --> 00:55:50,593
[LAUGHS]

1461
00:55:50,677 --> 00:55:52,094
One weekend, I say to him,

1462
00:55:52,178 --> 00:55:55,598
I say, "Why don't we
go out to the country?

1463
00:55:55,682 --> 00:55:58,768
You know anything about the country?"

1464
00:55:58,852 --> 00:56:01,020
He says… [DEEP VOICE]: "Sure,

1465
00:56:01,104 --> 00:56:03,273
"I… I know about the country.

1466
00:56:03,357 --> 00:56:05,692
"When… When I was a young boy,

1467
00:56:05,776 --> 00:56:08,445
I used to live in the country."

1468
00:56:08,529 --> 00:56:11,448
I said, "When you was a young boy,

1469
00:56:11,532 --> 00:56:14,117
everybody lived in the country."

1470
00:56:14,201 --> 00:56:17,622
[LAUGHTER AND CHEERING]

1471
00:56:17,706 --> 00:56:19,123
Geez.

1472
00:56:19,207 --> 00:56:21,292
That's not intimidating at all.

1473
00:56:21,376 --> 00:56:23,628
And she's as sweet as pie, to boot.

1474
00:56:23,712 --> 00:56:25,046
And thank you, Lord!

1475
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:29,300
I'm talking to people who
know what I'm talking 'bout.

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

1477
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,271
EMCEE: The great Moms
Mabley, ladies and gentlemen.

1478
00:56:41,355 --> 00:56:42,689
That's the way it's done.

1479
00:56:42,773 --> 00:56:44,776
I wish you'd told me that before Dayton.

1480
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,694
Could've saved a whole bunch of time.

1481
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,530
-Excuse me.
-And now please welcome

1482
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:50,698
-the Silver Belles.
-Excuse me.

1483
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,784
Go see if there's any
of that Shy food left over.

1484
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:54,202
I'm starving.

1485
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:56,037
Excuse me. Moms?

1486
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:59,625
I mean, Mrs.… Mrs. Moms.
Miss Moms. Moms Mabley. Ma'am.

1487
00:56:59,709 --> 00:57:02,837
I don't know what to call
you, but I am a really big fan.

1488
00:57:02,921 --> 00:57:05,714
Well, a really big fan
might know what to call me.

1489
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:07,716
I actually saw you in Chicago.

1490
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,301
We only played one night there,
and, technically, I was supposed

1491
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:11,304
to be at the theater in case
Shy called me back up for a bit,

1492
00:57:11,388 --> 00:57:12,806
which he does sometimes but not a lot…

1493
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:14,808
Uh-huh. Get me a chair, honey.

1494
00:57:14,892 --> 00:57:16,977
-I think this is gonna take a while.
-[CHUCKLES]

1495
00:57:17,061 --> 00:57:18,728
But I snuck out, because
you were playing Mister Kelly's,

1496
00:57:18,812 --> 00:57:20,147
and I'd also never seen Mister Kelly's.

1497
00:57:20,231 --> 00:57:21,231
So, anyhow, I went.

1498
00:57:21,315 --> 00:57:23,483
You were great then, too.

1499
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:24,819
What is your name, sweetheart?

1500
00:57:24,903 --> 00:57:26,988
Midge Maisel. Mrs. Maisel, actually.

1501
00:57:27,072 --> 00:57:28,656
-Tha… That's my stage name.
-Wait a minute,

1502
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:29,866
you're Mrs. Maisel?

1503
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,826
-Yes.
-Are you kidding me?

1504
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,411
This is the girl opening for Shy tonight.

1505
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:35,163
She's the one that got your spot.

1506
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:37,081
-I did?
-Yes, you did.

1507
00:57:37,165 --> 00:57:38,584
-Marcus.
-She's Moms Mabley.

1508
00:57:38,668 --> 00:57:40,461
You really think she
should be opening for you?

1509
00:57:40,545 --> 00:57:42,838
She's not opening for me.
I'm opening for Shy.

1510
00:57:42,922 --> 00:57:44,673
You got the prime spot, Shirley Temple.

1511
00:57:44,757 --> 00:57:46,175
You can't read a program?

1512
00:57:46,259 --> 00:57:47,885
I didn't know there was a program.

1513
00:57:47,969 --> 00:57:48,886
I'm gonna talk to Shy.

1514
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:49,887
I'm gonna really talk to Shy.

1515
00:57:49,971 --> 00:57:51,890
-Oh, Marcus, hush now.
-It's not right.

1516
00:57:51,974 --> 00:57:53,641
Who the hell is this
little white girl anyhow?

1517
00:57:53,725 --> 00:57:56,436
Oh, Marcus, you back off now.

1518
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,855
That audience out there is
gonna give her a tough enough time

1519
00:57:58,939 --> 00:58:01,608
without you in her face.

1520
00:58:01,692 --> 00:58:04,611
It was nice meeting you, Mrs. Maisel.

1521
00:58:04,695 --> 00:58:08,283
Welcome to the Apollo.

1522
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:14,788
Oh. Good.

1523
00:58:14,872 --> 00:58:16,707
Eat this.

1524
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:18,000
What's the matter?

1525
00:58:18,084 --> 00:58:20,086
Nothing. Do you have a program?

1526
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,506
-A what?
-Why am I opening for Shy, Reggie?

1527
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:24,007
'Cause Shy ain't gonna open for you.

1528
00:58:24,091 --> 00:58:26,343
Do you think this is
the right crowd for me?

1529
00:58:26,427 --> 00:58:28,762
Well, it's the crowd
you got, so let's hope so.

1530
00:58:28,846 --> 00:58:30,931
I don't know. I don't know.

1531
00:58:31,015 --> 00:58:32,683
-Midge.
-They loved Moms.

1532
00:58:32,767 --> 00:58:34,602
I shouldn't be on after Moms Mabley.

1533
00:58:34,686 --> 00:58:35,853
They're gonna hate me for that.

1534
00:58:35,937 --> 00:58:37,522
Oh. You been talking to Marcus?

1535
00:58:37,606 --> 00:58:38,940
He called me a white girl.

1536
00:58:39,024 --> 00:58:41,025
-Wow. Low blow.
-He's right.

1537
00:58:41,109 --> 00:58:42,777
There's royalty on this stage tonight.

1538
00:58:42,861 --> 00:58:44,779
I'm… I'm not ready for this.
I haven't earned it.

1539
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,365
It doesn't matter if you earned it.
It's here.

1540
00:58:46,449 --> 00:58:47,366
You got to do it.

1541
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:48,534
I'm nervous.

1542
00:58:48,618 --> 00:58:49,785
I'm never nervous,

1543
00:58:49,869 --> 00:58:52,037
but, right now, I am
really, really nervous.

1544
00:58:52,121 --> 00:58:53,205
