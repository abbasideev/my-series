A mean man, an angry man.

and run home to your mommies.

531

For the record, I didn't run. I didn't.

Teaching is an act of generosity,

534
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,099
and I was miserly.

535
00:21:57,183 --> 00:22:00,019

Frankly speaking,

1222
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:28,045
is it wise for Miss Julie to dance twice

1223
00:48:28,129 --> 00:48:29,672

1224

to prefer one servant to all the rest.

and do it, and you didn't.

1363
00:54:38,848 --> 00:54:41,642
You fuckin' folded like a deck of cards.

1364
00:54:41,726 --> 00:54:44,228
-Harry knew.
-Harry knew what?

1365
00:54:44,312 --> 00:54:46,939
That you didn't have the
stuff to make it on Broadway.

1366
00:54:47,023 --> 00:54:48,857
He was no idiot. He knew.

1367
00:54:48,941 --> 00:54:52,152
And I do not have to
take you down for her.

1368
00:54:52,236 --> 00:54:53,737
You are not her competition.

1369
00:54:53,821 --> 00:54:55,656
You are not even in the same league.

1370
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,825
She's got guts.

1371
00:54:57,909 --> 00:54:59,619
That is the difference
between Midge Maisel

1372
00:54:59,703 --> 00:55:02,455
and the great Sophie Lennon.

1373
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:03,957
You're a star, for now,

1374
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:06,585
but she is gonna be a goddamn legend.

1375
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:11,005
SUSIE: I'm setting
those fuckin' birds loose

1376
00:55:11,089 --> 00:55:13,091
the minute I get home.
