00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:40,407
Why do Jews do this to themselves?

182

Why do they find terrible
places and go live there?

Are you kidding?

00:05:58,344 --> 00:05:59,803
You grew up in the Rockaways.

Okay. That's it.

-I am an expert.
-Get out of here.

203
00:06:17,114 --> 00:06:18,699
Swimming's fun. It makes your tush tight.

204
00:06:18,783 --> 00:06:20,284
I like a nice loose tush.

205

Hey, we are on tour now.

00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:23,370
We will be flying in planes.

And if one of those planes
goes down in the water,

208
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,457
you are gonna have to know how to swim.

209

Oh, good.
You found a way to make flying even worse.

For one, what's-his-face,

I don't believe that.

269
00:08:10,112 --> 00:08:12,031
I haven't had anyone
look at me that coldly

He has three plays running.
Two are the Cherry Orchard.

275
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,502
He could have his pick of projects,

276
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,254
and he wanted to do this play with you,

277
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,463
with Sophie Lennon.

278
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,883
Well, Sophie Lennon doesn't like him.

279
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,593
[WHISPERS] He's bossy.

280
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,178
-What did he do?
<i>-I wanted to sit</i>

281
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,431
<i>on one of my lines, and he said stand.</i>

282
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,849
Then he told me I had to wear a wig,

283
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,475
so he obviously hates my hair.

284
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,935
He said no to the nudity,

285
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,479
and he told me I had
to memorize my lines.

286
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,480
Well, you were planning to
memorize your lines anyway,

287
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,482
weren't you?

288
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,401
Yes, but now I don't want to.

289
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:48,070
I despise being told what to do.

290
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,447
That's kind of his job, Sophie.

291
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:51,282
Oh, and he loves Gavin.

292
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:53,702
[CLICKS TONGUE] Oh,
Gavin is his favorite.

294
00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:56,872
Probably about my hair.

295
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:58,832
And did you hear about Gavin's movie?

296
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,793
-No.
<i>-Gavin is doing a pirate movie</i>

297

in the fall, and, apparently,
he has a hard out.

00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:07,508
And now they're telling me
our opening date isn't flexible.

299
00:09:07,592 --> 00:09:08,509
It's not flexible.

-Everything's flexible.

00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:13,890
money's changed hands. That's it.

303
00:09:13,974 --> 00:09:15,559
But what if it's not ready by then?

304
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:16,894
What if it needs more time?

305
00:09:16,978 --> 00:09:18,812
And by "it," I mean "me."

You'll be ready. You'll be great.

so I can drown myself?

317
00:09:47,678 --> 00:09:49,096
The font is electric.

The size of the paper.

00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:06,573
Well, it's… I mean…

00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:08,659
This doesn't look strange to you?

-Your outfit?
-No. What?

330
00:10:10,703 --> 00:10:12,621
Not my outfit. The paper.

331
00:10:12,705 --> 00:10:14,164
The paper is enormous.

332
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:15,749
Big ideas need space, Abe.

333
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,086
I understand that, but
this is a lot of space.

334
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,797
I mean, it's not even
shaped like a newspaper.

335
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,465
You mean it's not shaped
like the <i>New York Times.</i>

336
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:24,134
The fascist <i>New York Times.</i>

337
00:10:24,218 --> 00:10:26,595
Forget everything you know
about a newspaper, Abe.

We're changing all the rules.

Yes, thank you for… reminding me of that.

Uh, where's the title?

-It's on the fourth page.
-The fourth?

344
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,776
You have to care enough
about the cause to find it.

Keep going. Keep going.

346
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:43,322
Keep going.

00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:47,368
Oh. Yes.

350
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:49,287
There it is.

351
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:51,122
"Title to come."

352
00:10:51,206 --> 00:10:52,707

353
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,125
Did we settle on that
or are we still pitching?

354
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:55,501
SHIRLEY: Abe.

355
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:58,423
May I see you in the
kitchen for a moment, please?

356
00:11:05,054 --> 00:11:06,263
Who are they?

357
00:11:06,347 --> 00:11:08,058
My friends from the paper.

358
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:10,560
Did you ask my permission
before you invited your friends over?

359
00:11:10,644 --> 00:11:11,811
I thought I did.

360
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:12,896
Well, you didn't.

361
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,398
Well, I'm sorry, Shirley.

362
00:11:15,482 --> 00:11:18,819
But I did ask Moishe last night,

363
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:20,488
and he said it was okay.

364
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:21,530
He did?

365
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,157
-Yes, he did.
-Ah.

366
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:24,367
He never mentioned anything to me

367
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:25,701
about you having your friends over.

368
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,287
Well, maybe he forgot
to tell you, but he did.

369
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:30,123
-Should I ask him?
-What?

370
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:32,042
He's upstairs. I can ask him right now.

371
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:34,711
-I don't think…
-Moishe!

372
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,839
Moishe, could you come down here, please?

373
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:39,300
Sh… Shirley, this is
completely unnecessary.

374
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:40,760
-Moishe!
-Shirley.

375
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:42,345
-Someone's in trouble.
-Shut up, Alan.

376
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:43,805
-Moishe!
-MOISHE: Yeah?!

377
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:45,848
Can you come down here, please?

378
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:47,225
Shirley, I assure you…

379
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:48,768
-Moishe!
-I'm not wearing pants!

380
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:50,479
I need to ask you something.

381
00:11:50,563 --> 00:11:51,772
MOISHE: You can't ask me from there?

382
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:53,732
-No.
-Do I need to put on pants?

383
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:55,359
-Yes!
-All right.

384
00:11:55,443 --> 00:11:57,236
Even though it's Wednesday,
and Wednesday's the day

385
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,279
I stay home and work without pants!

386
00:11:59,363 --> 00:12:01,282
Shirley, we're just
sitting in the dining room

387
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:02,784
discussing the paper.

388
00:12:02,868 --> 00:12:04,494
We'll be another half hour at the most.

389
00:12:04,578 --> 00:12:06,079
All right, I'm down.

390
00:12:06,163 --> 00:12:08,415
-What do you want?
-Did you give Abe permission

391
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:10,126
-to have his friends over?
-No.

392
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,585
You did, too.

393
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:14,130
-Remember? Last night?
-No.

394
00:12:14,214 --> 00:12:15,464
-Abe says you did.
-I did what?

395
00:12:15,548 --> 00:12:17,216
Say that he could have his friends over.

396
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,300
Ah. No.

397
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:19,969
So, Abe, now you're lying to us?

398
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:22,222
I am not lying. I asked.

399
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:24,141
He doesn't remember; it happens.

400
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:26,101
-You didn't ask.
-All right, fine.

401
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:27,686
I won't argue with you.

402
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,190
But at this moment, my friends
are here, in the dining room,

403
00:12:31,274 --> 00:12:33,443
which I told you they would be,

404
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:36,154
and you forgot, but since you agreed

405
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:37,905
that it would be fine for them to come,

406
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:40,241
and since they are here

407
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:42,786
there… already,

408
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,206
what am I supposed to do?

409
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,666
I don't think we need weather.
If they want

410
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,251
to know the weather,
they can look outside.

411

-That's crazy, man.
-[SIGHS]

412
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,923
Something wrong, Abe? Again?

413
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,550
I thought you'd be happy.

414
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:56,801
We agreed to move the title back

415
00:12:56,885 --> 00:12:58,094
to the front page like you wanted.

416
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,305
I can't believe this spelling.

417
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:03,434
How many Ls in latitude? Anyone?

418
00:13:03,518 --> 00:13:05,561
Too long a pause.

419
00:13:05,645 --> 00:13:06,979
Wh… What are you doing?
Are you correcting it?

420
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:08,522
Apostrophe "S."

We're fighting against
fascism, not punctuation.

00:13:11,693 --> 00:13:13,153
Wow. Dig the cap and gownship.

423
00:13:13,237 --> 00:13:14,446
I feel like I'm back in school, man.

424
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,114
You should be back in school.

425
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:18,783
This looks like it was
written by a pack of jackals.

426
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:20,535
You know what, Abe?
You're becoming a bit of a drag.

427
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:22,204
Drag, drag, drag.

428
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:23,831
We just finished our first paper.

429
00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:25,249
That's right.

I thought you were Alan's girlfriend.

00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:34,718
No woman is any man's property.

433
00:13:34,802 --> 00:13:35,969
You should be looking at the ideas.

434
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:37,387
Not the spelling. Not the grammar.

435
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:40,682
-Look, people…
-Ugh. Old man lecture time.

436
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:44,145
The greatest threat to
humanity is ignorance.

437
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:46,606
That's why the free
press is so important.

00:13:49,985 --> 00:13:52,946
This is not a corporate,
sanitized, proofed paper.

440
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,699
It's real, it's raw, it's ragged.

441
00:13:55,783 --> 00:13:57,409
Who cares about spelling and punctuation

00:13:57,493 --> 00:13:59,036
-and clarity?
-And page numbers.

You're not taking this seriously.

In my day we took things seriously.

445
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,086
Yes. And then there was World War I.

00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,796
What the hell does that mean?

so neither one of us
takes direction very well.

We'll find a pharmacy.

Some calamine lotion, an aspirin,

00:14:44,378 --> 00:14:46,922
an ice bath… you'll feel much better.

should go fuck yourself.
