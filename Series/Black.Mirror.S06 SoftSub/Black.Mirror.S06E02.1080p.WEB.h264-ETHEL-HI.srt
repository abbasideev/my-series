- Hey, Mum.
- I was worried. It's almost six.

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,680
I took a detour after Luss
to show Pia the pretty way.

18
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,520
I slept through it. [laughs] Hi.

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,520
[man] Pia, Mum. Mum, Pia.

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,000
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
Janet.

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,120
- Pretty wee thing you've captured.
- [man] Mum!

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,280
Hey, I'm flattered. Thank you.

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,080
- I like your accent.
- [gasps excitedly] Ditto.

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,760
What was that, love?

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,760
Ditto.

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,200
Uh, "ditto."

Oh! [laughs]

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,080
So, did you grow up in America?
Or are you originally from...

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,280
Jesus, Mum!

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,600
US, born and bred. [chuckles]

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,320
- Okay.
- [Pia chuckles nervously]

33
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,480
[Janet] I hope you're both hungry.

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,040
Dad was.

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,800
- Is that him?
- [man] Aye. Kenneth.

38
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,960
"Kenny," Mum called him.

39
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,040
Is it creepy if I say
he looks good in that cap?

40
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,440
A bit. Yeah.

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,640

around the village,

44
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,080
and then we'll probably
set off Monday morning.

45
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,880
- You're only staying two nights?
- Well, we've got to head on to Rùm.

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,240
To shoot, uh, my film...

47
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,080
<i>Our... </i>our film.

[both chuckle]

49
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,760
Uh, about the rare egg guy.

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,280
So, that's what your documentary's about?
This egg collector from Rùm?

51
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,840
He's not a collector. He...

52
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,920
he guards rare eggs
against collectors who want to steal them.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,960
It's, uh, it's a big trade.

54
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,400
The way I see it,
this is going to be a story

55
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,560
about one of the last remaining holdouts
against the commodification of nature.

56
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,880
Not about a man who watches eggs?

57
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,360
Well, yeah, but it...

58
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,760
He's like a vigilante.

59
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,560
A guardian angel.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,640
Egg theft is illegal,

61
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,240
but the local cops aren't interested,
or they're too lazy.

62
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,440
I mean... [chuckles]

63
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,800
Maybe if someone who looked like me
were stealing the eggs...

64
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,600
They're probably just overstretched.
Policing's a very demanding job.

65
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,120
As your dad knew.

66
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,960
- Mm.
- Yeah. I mean...

67
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Yeah.

68
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,200
[Pia] I saw that photo of him in uniform,

69
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,240
and 20 minutes later,
I'm shit-mouthing the cops? Like...

She hates me.

73
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,680
- No, she doesn't. She likes you.
- She said that?

74
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,600
It's just, anything with Dad...

75
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,480
She's sensitive. She misses him.

76
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,240
Well, of course. I mean, you must too.

77
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
In theory.

78
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Sort of do.

79
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,360
I was eight when he died,

80
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,000
so most of my life,
he's just been a few photographs.

81
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
[Pia] Mm.

82
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
He was ill quite a while before he died.

83
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,360
Uh, needed a lot of caring, you know.

84
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,040
I think that really took it out of Mum.

from then on.

- Well...

- It's okay.
- We should leave now.

121
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,200
[man] That's because
people paint landscapes.

I mean, this place is amazing.
I can't believe it's so empty.

I told you
never to show your face in here again.

You can walk right back out that door <i>now!</i>

How are you doing, you fucking wank?

You gonna tell me your pronouns?

131

132

I thought you were in London,
studying woke film theory,

or whatever you call it.

Someday, this guy will be polishing BAFTAs

135
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,840
and forgetting about us poor wee shites
he used to cut about with.

136
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,880
Years ago, Stuart made a model
for my short video.

137
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,120
A spaceship.

138
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,136
- Yeah, a <i>Solaris </i>tribute.
- With a working engine.

139
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,040
[Davis] You get the picture.

140
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,040
Said if he ended up
making the next <i>Star Wars,</i>

141
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,920
I'd help out with the special effects,
but he's, uh...

142
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,000
he's turned his back on us old gadgies
now he's down the big town, eh?

143
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,480
- See, he's not even introducing you to me.
- Oh, sorry.

144
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,480
This is Pia.

145
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,720
- She was in my film course as well.
- Oh!

146
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,520
- Oh, <i>your </i>course, was it?
- No.

147
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,560
He thinks they're gonna name it
after him someday.

148
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,776
Well, I thought they were gonna name it
after me, so...

149
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,840
Yes, well, that would be
the smart move, eh?

150
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,080
What with fucking diversity and all that.

151
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,120
Uh, three pints on the house. No charge.

152
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Crisps all around?

153
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,600
It's a shame he's dragged you
out of London up to this ghost town, eh?

154
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,040
All the holiday atmosphere of a hospice.

155
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,520
You're still in business.

156
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,960
Skin of the teeth, man. Look around.

157
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,160
We are on our arse.

158
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,640
I keep telling Dad
if things don't pick up,

159
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,760
we'll just have to bite the bullet
and jack it fucking in.

160
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Speak of the cunt.

161
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,520
- What are you doing?
- Well, I sh... I should say hello.

162
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,080
No, no, don't bother.

163
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,520
That'll be his fifth refill today.

164
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,920
The only reason
he comes downstairs these days.

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Christ.

166
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,560
Oh, there he goes.

167
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Up to his pit.

168
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,880
Is he... is he depressed, or...

169
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,440
[Stuart] Of course he's depressed.

170
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,360
There used to be three pubs around here.

171
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,200
And now we're the last man standing.
It's a...

172
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,480
it's a proper dead zone.

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,760
I don't get it.
It's so beautiful around here. I...

174
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,880
How are you not overrun with tourists?

175
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,240
'Cause of Iain Adair.

176
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,920
Who is Iain Adair?

177
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,400
- You didn't tell her about Iain Adair?
- [scoffs] Come on.

178
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,280
- It's... it's a bit...
- Who is Iain Adair?

179
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,880
Okay, okay, fine. So...

180
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,680
[exhales] Iain Adair was a guy who lived
up at Five Acres Farm on the hill there

181
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,840
with his mum and dad.

182
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,600
People said he was quiet, easily led,
not too bright. All of that, you know?

183
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,800
But really, he was just some local guy.

184
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,280
- Anyway...
- Turned out he tortured and killed people.

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,280
I was building up to that.

186
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,000
I haven't got your storytelling instincts.
You tell it.

187
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,760
- No, you spoiled it now.
- No, not the end bit with your dad.

188
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,640
- What end bit with your dad?
- Can I just start from the beginning?

189
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,560
Yeah, just pretend
you don't know the murder stuff yet.

190
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,720
- Sure.
- [Davis] Okay.

191
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
So,

192
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
picture it.

193
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,920
[bagpipe music playing]

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,280
[Davis] <i>There used to be loads
of holidaymakers here.</i>

195
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
<i>Loads of them.</i>

196
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,680
<i>In 1997, this couple in their twenties
hire a cottage for their honeymoon.</i>

197
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,160
[Stuart] <i>Back when we still had tourists.</i>

198
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,240
[unsettling music playing]

199
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,600
[laughs] <i>Sorry.</i>

200
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,320
- [Davis] <i>They were here for about a week.</i>
- [girl] <i>Mr. Smiley.</i>

201
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,720
[Davis] <i>Loads of people saw them</i>.

202
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,800
Dad said they drank in here
a couple of nights.

203
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,640
[echoing clink]

204
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,616
[Davis] <i>Come the end of the week,
they're supposed to have left.</i>

205
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,680
The cleaner comes to get their cottage
ready for the next booking.

206
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,680
Their car's parked outside.

207
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,880
[unsettling music continues]

208
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,720
<i>And all their stuff's still there.</i>

209
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,280
No sign of them. Gone.

210
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,960
- Creepy.
- Very creepy.

211
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,880
- So, of course, Dad gets called in.
- His dad was a local policeman.

212
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,560
- Aye, she knows that.
- Oh. Okay, sorry.

213
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,440
[Davis] <i>So, Dad's asking around, right?
Knocking on doors.</i>

214
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,920
<i>This couple is nowhere to be found.</i>

215
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,280
<i>Vanished off the face of the earth
and all that.</i>

216
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,920
[police siren blaring]

217
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,200
<i>After a day or two,
it becomes a big story.</i>

218
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
[Stuart] <i>Mm.</i>

219
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,696
[Davis] <i>Tabloids pick it up.</i>

220
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,120
<i>Place is swarming with journalists.
It's a frenzy.</i>

221
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,480
<i>But then weeks go by,
and there's no sign of them. Nothing.</i>

222
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,480
[unsettling music fades]

223
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,720
And then Princess Diana died. You know?

224
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,840
Papers moved onto that.
Story fizzles out. Finished.

225
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,280
Until one day...

226
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
One night.

227
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Mm.

228
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,280
Iain Adair's drinking in here.

229
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,160
- In here?
- He drank in here all the time.

230
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,760
- Always sat right there.
- [tense music playing]

231
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,960
[Davis] <i>Anyway, this night,</i>

232
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,480
<i>he's had way more than usual.</i>

233
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,360
<i>People say he's talking weird.</i>

234
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,960
<i>He's making a nuisance of himself.</i>

235
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,560
<i>There's a poster of the missing couple
on the wall.</i>

236
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,560
He even makes comments about the girl.
And your dad...

237
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,480
Yeah, the auld pissheid,
he tells Iain he's barred.

238
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,360
Iain tells him to fuck off.

239
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,560
<i>Says he's got half a mind
to come back and shoot the place up.</i>

240
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
[Pia] <i>Nice.</i>

241
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,720
Dad's worried now 'cause Iain's a farmer.
He's got a shotgun.

242
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,360
So, Dad asks Kenneth, his dad,

243
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,640
to go and check in on Iain,
have a word with him.

244
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,200
- So then Dad...
- His dad, Kenneth.

245
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,560
- Of course it's my dad.
- Sorry.

246
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,480
[Davis] <i>Dad drives up to Five Acres.</i>

247
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
[tense music continues]

248
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,680
<i>Knocks on the door.</i>

249
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,440
<i>Says, "I just wanna talk to you," etc.</i>

250
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,840
<i>Iain doesn't answer.</i>

251
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,440
Dad's walking back to his car
when Iain opens the upstairs window and...

252
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
shoots him.

253
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,240
Sorry. He shot your dad?

254
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,640
- Yeah.
- [Stuart] Mm-hmm.

255
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,720
- Not fatally, in the shoulder. Bad though.
- Holy shit.

256
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,760
<i>So Dad, crawling back to his car,
calls for backup,</i>

257
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,440
<i>when, from inside the house...</i>

258
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Bang! Bang! Bang!

259
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,000
Then nothing.

260
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
<i>Backup arrives.</i>

261
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
<i>They go in.</i>

262
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,880
Iain Adair shot his mum and dad,
then himself.

263
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,720
Total wipeout.

264
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,360
- Farmicide.
- [Davis] Mm.

265
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,160
While they're looking around the farm,

266
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,240
they check out the cellar.

267
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
Oh God.

268
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,880
[suspenseful music playing]

269
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,520
[Davis] <i>Behind a wardrobe,
there's a hidden door leading to a bunker.</i>

270
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,880
- Old WWII, or '60s, or something.
- Here we go.

271
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,960
[Davis] <i>And inside,
it's like a torture room.</i>

272
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,840
This guy had been abducting people.

273
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,320
<i>Keeping them down there and doing
God knows what for weeks at a time.</i>

274
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,880
<i>And then burying the bodies
out in the fields.</i>

275
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,800
[helicopter whirring]

276
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,560
- The honeymoon couple?
- [chuckles]

277
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,080
- Fuck me, and the rest of them.
- The rest?

278
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,960
[Davis] <i>Around here, the countryside
can be pretty dangerous.</i>

279
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,880
<i>There's deep water and all that, you know?</i>

280
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,240
<i>Sometimes, people went missing.</i>

281
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,920
<i>Walker takes a wrong turn, you know?</i>

282
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,160
<i>Someone rents a kayak
and doesn't come back.</i>

283
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,880
Over the years,
nobody was really totting it all up.

284
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,760
- How many we talking about?
- Eight.

285
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,080
[Pia] Oh.

286
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,000
All been tortured.

287
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,480
And the rest of it.
Dark sex things. Really extreme stuff.

288
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,480
- [Davis] Yeah. Okay.
- It'd give you nightmares.

289
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,600
So... [chuckles nervously]

290
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,800
Yeah, that was Iain Adair.

291
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,640
That is a lot.

292
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,896
- [Davis] Mm-hmm.
- [Stuart] Mm.

293
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,760
And as you can imagine,
it doesn't look great on TripAdvisor.

294
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
End result?

295
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,600
Fuck-all visitors.

296
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,400
- Didn't just shit in his victims' mouths.
- Don't know he did that.

297
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,840
He shat on the tourist trade too.

298
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,080
But your dad, he recovered.

299
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,120
- I mean...
- Well, his injuries weren't that bad.

300
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,280
- He was in hospital a couple of weeks.
- [Pia] Right.

301
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,680
But while he was in there, he got MRSA.

302
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,880
And that killed him over time.

303
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,480
So, far as Mum's concerned,
Iain Adair killed Dad too.

304
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
[Stuart] Well...

305
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,000
- She's not wrong.
- Aye.

306
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,920
[sighs]

307
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,960
- [Stuart] Another pint?
- Aye. [laughs]

308
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
Magda!

309
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Three pints.

310
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,680
[liquid pouring]

311
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,080
Can we go see where it happened?

312
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,960
[glasses clatter]

313
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,680
[Pia] It's perfect.

314
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
You don't see it?

315
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,920
- See what?
- Can we get in there?

316
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,720
No. It's boarded up. There's planks.
Why would we wanna get in there?

317
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,880
Because. This is what our film
should be about.

318
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
All of this.

319
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,320
What? This?

320
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
Wha...

321
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,280
Quaint little village,

322
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,680
but for years, this Hannibal Lecter dude
has been operating a death den?

323
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,280
At the heart of it? I mean, it's a story.

324
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,680
- It's an actual story.
- Are you serious?

325
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,120
- Well, yeah.
- But...

326
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,120
- We're meeting the egg guy on Wednesday.
- Fuck the egg guy. I'm sorry. Come on.

327
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,160
Come on! [scoffs]

328
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,920
You said you liked the egg idea.

329
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
Oh, babe.

330
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,280
I kinda liked it.

331
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,920
Just like I kinda like plain pasta
in a pinch. But I love this.

332
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,080
I love it!

333
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,080
So, um...

334
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,360
A... a true crime film about Iain Adair?

335
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,440
[Pia] We can pitch
to production companies, who will fund it.

336
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,920
I had a meeting with Kate Cezar
at Historik. She might go for this.

337
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,440
- People know the story.
- I didn't.

338
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,560
I mean, it's not a whodunit.
There's no mystery.

339
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,880
Are you nuts? [scoffs]

340
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,760
The mystery is,
"How could someone do that shit?"

341
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,120
It's "What the fuck?"
It's "Give me the details."

342
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,320
And the details are so awful,

that will maybe play at a festival

352
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,080

by a couple dozen documentary nerds?

353
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,360
Or something that people will watch?

354

- Of course. That's not what I meant.

Okay, okay, and we can make that point.
Her point.

362

He was a victim too.

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,320
What is it you're working on?

514
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,680
We're doing a documentary

515
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,880
about what... happened.

516
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,320
Iain Adair and all that.

517
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,040
Not about your man and the eggs?

518
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,040
Uh, no.

519
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,160
You'll explain what he did to your father?

520
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,320
- Only if you want us to.
- Oh, I want you to.

521
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,600
People should know. Everyone should know.

522
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,280
My Kenny died because of that man.

523
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,840
If Iain Adair was still alive,

524
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,040
I'd wring his neck myself
with these hands. I would.

525
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,640
We were happy before he broke it all.

526
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,880
Ruined it all.

527
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,440
Such a stupid man.

528
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,480
Just the waste of it.

529
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
I'm sorry.

530
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,160
It's okay, Mum.

531
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,360

you want me to help with,

532
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,720

Oh, no. You're okay.

and you just answer as yourself. As you.

538
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
[Janet] As me?

539
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,840
[Davis] Uh,

540
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,320
just talk loosely about the case.

541
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,320
[Janet] Loosely? Like, relaxed?

542
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
[Davis] No.

543
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,240
Been years since I was in front
of any kind of camera at all.

544
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,440
Last time would've been
that old one your dad had.

545
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,400
- But your dad never had all this stuff.
- He wasn't filming for broadcast, Mum.

546
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,680
Can you imagine? [chuckles]

547
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,320
[Pia] So, what do you think?

548
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
[woman] Well, it's a fascinating case.

549
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,160
Iain Adair, I mean, I'd heard of him.

550
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,560
But he's not as well-known
as a Ted Bundy or a Fred West.

551
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,520
So... [exhales]...if we take this anywhere,

552
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,440
the first question any platform,
network, whatever, is gonna ask is,

553
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,640
"What's the hook?"

554
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,800
What's the context?

555
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,200
There is a personal angle.
I mean, his dad was one of the victims.

556
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,200
Uh, yeah. He... he was a policeman.
He was shot at the farm.

557
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,080
So, he was murdered?

558
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,320
He died later.

559
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,160
Of his injuries or...

560
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,000
Not directly,
but... but... but basically, yeah.

561
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,280
[Pia] But he was one of the victims.

562
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,960
- [Davis] Mm.
- This gives him a voice.

563
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,920
And, you know, that's important to me,
you know, as a...

564
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
as a son.

565
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,400
[woman] I think definitely explore
the personal angle,

566
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,760
see what there is in it.

567
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,760
But, um, can you get hold of
any new material?

568
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,640
Police interviews, diaries,
that kind of thing.

569
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,800
We can look into those.

570
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,560
Something unseen, unheard, unexplored
is what you need.

571
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,840
What about the house itself
and the dungeon?

572
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,560
- It's still there.
- And you have access?

573
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
Yes.

574
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,840
Absolutely.

575
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,240
So, how come you're using this old thing?
