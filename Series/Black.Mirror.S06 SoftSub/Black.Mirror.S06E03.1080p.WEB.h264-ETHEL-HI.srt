go back to the same pose afterward.

00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,600
Why do I have to be here?
It's Ricky's birthday.

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,960
And he's your brother.

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,560
Okay, we all ready to go?

Hey.

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,160
So, um, Henry was wondering
how long till dinner.

23
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
Huh.

24
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,520

I hope to transmit moving pictures</i>

00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,520
- Is that yours too?
- Uh, excuse me.

- Excuse me, sir.
- Yeah.

35
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,680
Uh, I apologize for the intrusion,
but, uh, you're David Ross?

I believe I am.

37

- Oh my God. Such an honor.

38
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,520
- Thank you. You're too kind.
- [chuckles]

You are so real. Uh, it's incredible.

It's amazing.

43
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,240
So, up there,
are you, like, sleeping right now?

44
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,720
It's a kind of sleep.

- So great to meet you.
- So great.

50
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,800
I know they're excited, but sometimes
they are so goddamn rude.

51
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,600
Oh, but they don't realize, honey.

52
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,120
Our Lord, Heavenly Father,
bless us and these thy gifts

53

through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

- [breathes deeply]
- [David grunts]

185
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,240
Lay his arm out.

186
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,240
[David grunting]

187
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,520
Let's see what's inside your hand, hmm?

188
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,280
[David grunts] No! No, no, no, no!

189
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,440
[Kappa] Yeah. Yep.

190
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,560
No! No, no, no, no, no!

191
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,040
- [skin tearing]
- [David grunting]

192
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,680
[Kappa] That is a tough steak.

193
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,880
[Kappa grunting perversely]

194
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,440
[skin tearing]

195
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,720
[Sigma] Freaky.

196
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,400
Oh, you don't even bleed right.

197
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,800
You are nothing natural, my friend.

198
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,040
Fuck.

199
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,240
Sigma, give me your hammer.

200
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,120
Theta, get his family.

201
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,440
No! No!

202
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,840
No!

203
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,960
Try to work out where you are.

204
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,840
[silence]

205
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
[panicked breathing]

206
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,640
[panting]

207
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,120
[David] Come on! Come on!

208
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
[device chimes]

209
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
[breathing heavily]

210
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
[tense music playing]

211
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,400
- [woman] Please.
- [David grunts]

212
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,320
Please, not my children. Please!

213
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,120
- Please. Please, not my children.
- [grunts]

214
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,480
Then whose children are they, huh?

215
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,960
We just wanna find out
who else is a machine, Mr. Bunny.

216
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,720
No, no, no, no, no.
No, none of us... none of us are.

217
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,360
Uh, it's just... it's just him.
It's just David.

218
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,840
[David exhales]

219
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,000
[woman] We're real.

220
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,040
We're real. I...

221
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,200
Blood. Real blood,

222
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,480
where I got cut.

223
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,480
Yeah, I... I don't doubt you're real.

224
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,880
[relieved exhale] Yeah.

225
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,000
- [Kappa] And your kids are real.
- Yeah!

226
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,360
I'm sorry to report
that's immaterial, sugar.

227
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,800
Because the way the facts run,

228
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,040
none of what has occurred in your home,
with your full knowledge,

229
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,520
is right in nature.

230
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,960
A man sleeps in the sky

231
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,960
while his mechanical image
walks the earth.

232
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,480
[grunting]

233
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,800
And you...

234
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,600
share your bed with this abomination?

235
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
Hmm?

236
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,760
You know none of this is right.

237
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,640
How can it be?

238
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,400
Defying nature must have a cost,

239
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,160
or what will become of us all?

240
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,360
So, yes, you.

241
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
[grunts angrily]

242
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,960
- And, yes, the children.
- No...

243
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,080
[screams]

244
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,920
And the machine man will watch

245
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,920
with his heart screaming
a million miles above us.

246
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,600
- [David screaming]
- [woman] Please, no.

247
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,080
[whimpers] Please! Please, no!

248
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,960
- Epsilon, you start.
- [woman] No!

249
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,000
- [blade rasps]
- [woman screams] No!

250
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,800
[screaming]

251
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,400
[woman screams] No!

252
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
[scream echoes]

253
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400

255
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
[phone ringing]

256
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,960
[phone ringing]

257
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,640
[phone ringing]

258
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
Hello.

259
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
Uh, what?

260
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,640
Wait, wait, wait.
What the hell are you saying?

261
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,080
[breathes deeply]

262
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,040
[device beeping]

263
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,240
[breathes deeply]

264
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
[zipper unzipping]

265
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,560
[unsettling music playing]

266
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,520
David?

267
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,280
David, it's me.

268
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,040
- [David exhales]
- David.

269
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,560
[David] Leave me alone.

270
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,280
[exhales]

271
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,600
[Cliff] I'm so sorry.

272
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,400
I said get out of here!

273
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,640
[David sniffles]

274
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,840
[footsteps approaching]

275
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,320
[Cliff] He told me to get out.

276
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,080
Spoke to Ground Control.

277
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,720
Holland says just leave him be.
He'll be in shock.

278
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,240
Sons of bitches that did this walked
into a station and gave themselves up.

279
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,600
Some sort of hippie cult.

280
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,680
Board says if we feel we need protection,
we can have it,

281
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,920
but we are a long way from California.

282
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,040
I keep thinking of them.

283
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,520
Jessica.

284
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,840
Those kids.

285
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,760
I can't even imagine.

286
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,200
Bastards even destroyed his replica.

287
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,120
Set it on fire.

288
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,160
That means the whole time
that I am down here, he's just

289
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,720
alone up there.

290
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,400
Two years down on the mission,

291
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,600
another four to go.

292
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,560
Can't they make him
another replica somehow?

293
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,000
They made these
while we were still back down here.

294
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,680
Now it's just not possible.

295
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,440
Even if they could,

296
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,840
what does he have left here?

297
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
[ethereal music playing]

298
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,000
[both breathing heavily]

299
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,560
[Cliff] <i>Soil and nutrients stable.</i>

- Paying attention?
- [Henry] Yeah.

315
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,480
[Cliff] All right.

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360

You're up.

Everything okay?

337
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
Sure.

338
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,920
Just looking things over.

[Lana] <i>You don't know
he was gonna throw himself out.</i>

340

[Cliff] I don't know.

341
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,560
I mean, if he were to do something,

342
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,880
I'm still up there.

343
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,880
That's a two-man ship.

344
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,040
It relies on the both of us.

345
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,240
If there was, like,
a computer malfunction,

346
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,920
some sort of technical issue,

347
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,080
that is me dead too.

348
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,520
Don't say that.

349
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,280
We have to think about this.

350
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,720
The man is lost.

351
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,200
I can't reach him,
and I don't know what to do.

352
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,880
What if...

353
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,960
what if you let him use your link?

354
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,480
My link?

355
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
As in...

356
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,640
Say, just for an hour.

357
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,080
Time enough to let him walk in the woods,

358
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,120
feel... feel the breeze on his face.

359
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,000
I don't know.
It'd be strange for you and Henry.

360
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,600
Henry doesn't need to know.

361
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,400
David might not even want that.

362
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,920
Even asking could be a kindness.

[pensive music playing]

364
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,440

0800 hours, commencing routine checks.

366
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,240
Distance to target, 4.7 AU.

367
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,280
[keyboard clacking]

368
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,600
[sighs]

369
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,280
Listen, David,

370
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,800
I was talking with Lana, and we both feel
that you could use a break.

371
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,280
How would you feel

372
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,360
about using my link?

373
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,240
Just for a little while.

374
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,520
Breathe some... [inhales]...air.

375
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,240
The house, it's a long way from anywhere.
It's real private.

376
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,200
There's a forest out back,
a couple streams for fishing.

377
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,480
It's a good place.

378
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,440
Would you...

379
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,200
would you like that?

380
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,240
I think I'd like that very much.

381
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,120
So...

382
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,240
I'll head to the link now.

383
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,040
How should I speak to him?

384
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,800
I mean, in manner?

385
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,080
Quiet?

386
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,280
Serious, or...

387
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,240
I don't know, regular?
Like it didn't happen?

388
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,040
I mean...

389
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,000
You know what I mean.

390
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,800
Well... [sighs]...he used to be talkative,

391
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,160
but right now, he's not easy to read.

392
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,200
Just let him take in the air.

393
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,560
[Cliff] You ready?

394
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,200
[breathes deeply]

395
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,360
[breathing nervously]

396
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
[device chimes]

397
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
[breathing nervously]

398
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,920
[low thrumming]

399
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,520
[ethereal music playing]

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,320
[device beeping]

401
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,080
[gentle string music playing]

402
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
Hello.

403
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
Hi.

404
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,680
Cliff said it might take
a little getting used to.

405
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,000
Would you like to see the forest?

406
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,760
Yes.

407
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Thank you.

408
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
[string music intensifies]

409
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,320
[exhales]

410
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
[Cliff] Wow.

411
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,360
This is my favorite spot.

412
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,320
[Cliff] Mm.

413
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,600
[exhales]

414
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,320
The air is so clear.

415
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,400
I'd forgotten.

416
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
Hm.

417
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
Hey.

418
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,640
[chuckles]

419
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,640
Hey.

420
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
[chuckles]

421
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
He likes you.

422
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
[chuckles]

423
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
[sobs]

424
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,320
[Cliff whimpers]

425
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,680
[sobs]

426
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,880
[whimpers]

427
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,120
[sobs]

428
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,080
[Cliff crying]

429
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,880
[music fades]

430
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,200
[Lana] What is it?

431
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,280
Uh...

432
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
Nothing.

433
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,680
Just...

434
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,960
You've quite the home.

435
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,920
[muffled chatter]

436
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,800
[soft clatter]

437
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,560
Your place...

438
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,760
is beautiful.

439
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,320
[chuckles softly]

440
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,320
Thank you.

441
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,800
Glad you enjoyed it.

442
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,440
Well, I best be, uh...

443
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,520
Of course.

444
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,800
I'll see you Friday.

445
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,640
[pats shoulder]

446
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,720
See you then.

447
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,040
- [device chimes]
- [exhales]

448
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,920
[device beeping]

449
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,440
[inhales deeply]

450

[exhales]

451
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,800
[pen scribbling]

452
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,480
- [Cliff] Hey.
- [gasps]

453
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,440
[sighs]

454
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,520
You scared me.

455
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,760
Well, it feels like that really worked.

456
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,160
He seems a little

457
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,920
lighter now.

458
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,520
So,

459
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,400
how was it?

460
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,040
The poor man. He wept like a child.

461
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,240
In front of you?

462
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,120
Mm-hmm.

463
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
What did you do?

464
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,320
Not much. I...

465
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,600
He sat up by the old tree.

466
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,600
What... what could I even say?

467
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
Yeah.

468
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,840
[inhales]

469
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,120
[Cliff exhales]

470
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,640
[treadmills whirring]

471
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
Hey.

472
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,800
Let me show you something.

473
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,000
- [Cliff] You did this from memory?
- [David scoffs]

474
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,680
When something is vivid,
I just kind of see it.

475
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,840
Wait, this is quite something.

476
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,960
If I had this down there,
I would hang it on the wall.

477
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,680
You know...

478
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,640
if you guys could maybe
get me a canvas and some oils,

479
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,040
I could paint you something like this
for your home.

480
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,120
Like a thank-you gift.

481
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,240
Uh-huh.

482
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,520
I mean, obviously, you'd have
to let me use your replica again.

483
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,240
You might not want to do that.
It's just... [scoffs]

484
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,600
Drawing helps.

485
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,800
I'd love to be able to paint again.

486
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,760
An oil painting.
I mean, how long would a painting take?

487
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,280
Well, a little while, obviously.

488
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
Okay.

489
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,280
Look, I understand.

490
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,320
I shouldn't ask. It's not fair.

491
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,760
I'm sorry.

492
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,000
Let me think it over.

493
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,240
Okay?

494
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,480
Okay.

495
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Thank you.

496
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
[Lana] <i>Just an hour?</i>

497
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,120
One hour.

498
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,920
Once a week, while I'm doing the physical.

499
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,120
I mean, it does make sense.

500
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,240
He can set up his things
up in the barn there.

501
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,240
He had a list of what he'd need,
canvas and fancy paints and whatnot.

502
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,800
Clearly, it has been on his mind.

503
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,080
What do you say?

504
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
Okay?

505
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,560
[device chimes]

506
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,760
[David breathes deeply]

507
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,280
[device beeping]

508
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,160
[Lana] Everything you need?
Think we got your whole list.

509
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,600
Looks like it.

510
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,840
Thank you.

511
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,520
How you finding that? <i>Valley of the Dolls?</i>

512
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,040
Oh. [chuckles]

513
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,840
Can't say I'm crazy about it.

514
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,680
I mean, it's fun,
but my goodness, it's trashy.

515
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,280
A guilty pleasure.

516
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,360
The guiltiest.

517
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,520
Do you like sci-fi?

518
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,360
Can't say I've tried it.
There aren't many books in the house.

519
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,640
Cliff doesn't really read.

520
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,360
I'll think of a few recommendations
for you.

521
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,680
I'd like that.

522
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,200
["Quand on n'a que l'amour"
by Jacques Brel playing]

523
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,320
["Quand on n'a que l'amour" continues]

524
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,040
Sir, may I leave the table?

525
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,040
[Cliff] Good boy.

526
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,200
["Quand on n'a que l'amour" continues]

527
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,400
- [Cliff] Have you done much painting?
- [music ends]

528
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,720
- [Lana] Not since kindergarten.
- [chuckles]

529
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,920
Here.

530
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,560
Um, I can't. I'd make a mess of it.

531
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,560
It's fine. You make a mess,
I can paint right over it.

532
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,680
Here you go.

533
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,200
Why don't you just try to add a little
to the tree there?

534
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,680
[Lana] How... how do I...

535
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,880
Don't be afraid of it.
Just a... just a light... light stroke.

536
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,480
[Lana chuckles]

537
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,120
Okay, that's a blob.

538
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,720
[Cliff] It's fine.
Here, just move the brush through it.

539
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,800
Here.

540
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,640
[whispers] Like...

541
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,640
this.

542
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,080
There we go.

543
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,800
Perfectly good leaf.

544
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,960
[Henry] Mom!

545
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,000
- Better see what he wants.
- [Cliff] Of course.

546
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,960
[device chimes]

547
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,840
[device beeping]

548
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,200
[Cliff] His painting's looking good.

549
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,440
[sighs]

550
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,200
[Lana] Everything okay?

551
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,400
Do you have any linseed oil? I've run out.

552
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,520
Linseed oil?

553
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,280
Yeah. It, uh, thins the paint
without mussing up the color.

554
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,960
Uh, Wesson oil any use to you?

555
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,520
Nah, that won't do it.

556
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,000
Is there a hardware store in town?

557
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,240
There's Mitchell's. They'll be open.

558
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,040
You think Cliff would mind
if we borrow his car?

559
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,480
[pensive music playing]

560
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,600
[sighs]

561
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,520
Got it.

562
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,600
[Cliff] Great.

563
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,800
Hey, I wanna check
the bookstore out a moment.

564
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,560
You wanna come?

565
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,720
Sure.

566
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,960
He wears it out.

567
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,000
This is a good one.

568
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,640
I think you'll like it.

569
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,320
[sighs] I'm sorry, I have to ask.

570
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,840
Are you Cliff Stanfield?

571
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,200
- Yes.
- [chuckles] I thought it was you.

572
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,800
Well, not you, but your, um...

573
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,760
What do you call it?

574
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,720
Replica.

575
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,720
Replica.

576
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,320
[chuckles] The things they can do!

577
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,240
And you must be Mrs. Stanfield.

578
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,760
Yes.

579
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,760
Heard you both moved
into the old Watson place.

580
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,960
How you finding it?

581
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,400
Well, it's, uh...

582
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,200
- I mean, it's wonderful.
- Oh, so beautiful up that way.

583
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,800
Great place for a family.

584
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,080
Absolutely.

585
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:26,400
I was so sorry to hear about what happened
with your copilot, Mr. Ross.

586
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,360
His whole family...

587
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,520
Such a terrible thing.

588
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,960
Well...

589
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,680
Yes.

590
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,880
How is he doing?

591
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,920
He's holding up.

592
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,640
We really ought to be going.

593
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,320
Of course.

594
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,360
So nice to meet you.

595
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,320
Thanks.

596
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
[Cliff exhales]

597
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,600
You okay?

[device beeping]

599
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,400

[exhales]

601
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,200
All yours.

602
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,160
Thank you.

603
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,200
See you Friday.

604
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,960
[switch clicks]

605
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,080
[Cliff] Hey.

606
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,120
Take a look.

607
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,760
Is... is that...

608
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,600
You added me?

609
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,840
[Cliff] You don't mind, do you?

610
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,480
[Lana] No.

611
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,040
No, not at all. I'm flattered.

612
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,040
["La mer" by Charles Trenet playing]

613
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,520

[Cliff] Lana!

[exhales]

618
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,080
It's okay.

619

[exhales]

620
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,880
I've given you the wrong idea.

621
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,040
He won't know.

622
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,440
Stop!

623
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,400
Hey.

624
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,520
You want this.

625
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,680
Get away from me.

626
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,000
You come here. You... you confuse me.

627
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,880
You pick out gifts. You mess with my head.

628
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,200
Work your way into my home
wearing my husband like a suit.

629
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,080
But this is not your home,
and you are not my husband.

630
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,520
That man is no match for you.

631
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,720
You are a guest in this house.

632
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,480
- And you want this.
- You don't know me.

633
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,240
I know the way you look at me.

634
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,360
At you?

635
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,600

[door opens]

639
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,800
Henry?

640
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,160
You should go.

641
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,240
[Cliff sighs]

642
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,920

644
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,720
Everything okay?

645
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,240
All fine.

Henry wrecked his painting.</i>

[Lana] <i>He hit him!</i>

648
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,640
He gave him a little smack
upside the head.

649
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,120
Which, as far as Henry knows,
was from you.

650
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,400
Nothing I haven't done myself
a hundred times.

651
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,720
You know Henry can be a terror.

652
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,520
Remember when he burned a hole
in the car seat? I whaled on him plenty,

653
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,880
right here in this room.

654
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,240

Look.

- David wants to finish the painting.
- The goddamn painting.

658
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,240
I know.

659
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,080
Let's just let him finish the painting.

660
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,240
Okay? That will be one,
two more visits tops.

661
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,480
And then... I will come up with something.

662
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,880
An excuse.

663
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,480
Okay?

664
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,600
Okay.

- Lana, listen.
- Your things are set up in the barn.

669
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,800
- Lana, please.
- I'm taking Henry to the pool.

I got an alert.

678
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,480
What's up?

679
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,120
You gonna explain that?

01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,840
It's ju... It's... it's a drawing.

Just a stupid...

683
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,280
Like a fantasy.

01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,720
Maybe I will bust your jaw.

685
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,320
You want a busted jaw?

686
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,080
I'm sorry. It's not what...

Oh, you got mixed up?

692
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,560

Why can't you see?

697
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,720
I don't have anything.

698
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,640
I've got nothing at all.

699
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:56,400
You have no idea what it's like to be me.

700
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,800
Everything I had...

701
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,600
Gone. Just

702
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,560

Unappreciated.

710
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,800
- Unsatisfied.
- You shut your mouth.

711
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,480
Untouched.

712
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,800

I know damn well.

Do you?

717
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,600
How much longer we gotta sit here?

718
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,400
Till your father's home.

- Yes, sir.

01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,920
- Cliff, what's wrong?
- Tell me what's gone on.

725
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,960
You and him. What's gone on?

726
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:09,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

727
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,600
What did you do?

728
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,640
I told you, nothing.

729
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,120
Did you pose for him?

730
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,200
No, I did not pose for him.

731
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,400
Show him your body?

732
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,320
Of course not.

733
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,720
Did he touch you?

734
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:21,720
No.

735
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,000
Did <i>you </i>touch him?

736
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,800
- No.
- Take him to our bed?

737
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,560
Absolutely not.

738
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,080
Tell me what happened!

739
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,280
Nothing. I swear.

740
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,040
He drew you naked.

741
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:35,200
In his quarters. Up there, onboard.

742
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,840
- I don't know what he drew.
- He draws from memory.

743
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,600
- From memory!
- He has seen nothing.

744
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,280
Give me the truth!

745
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,600
- I...
- Give me the truth!

746
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:52,480
I swear on my life, on Henry's life,
nothing happened.

747
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,200
But he wanted it to.

748
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,600
Yes.

749
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,680
- And you still let him come down here.
- You knew I didn't want him here anymore.

750
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,920
You never said that.

751
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,200
I told you he hit our son,
and you did not listen to me.

752
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,560
You didn't listen!

753
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,440
He said that

754
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:31,920
I don't touch you.

755
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,880
How did he know that?

756
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,520
I would never say anything like that
to anyone.

757
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,880
So, then, how did he know?

758
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:47,960
I don't know.

759
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,960
He thinks that you're lonely.

760
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,480
All the time you're here, I'm lonely.

761
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,520
We came here for you!

762
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:10,000
You brought me here, put me in this house.

763
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:15,960
Now I just walk from room to room,
and you walk from room to room,

764
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:19,000
but you're a shadow,
and I am here. I am real!

765
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,440
So, no, he didn't touch me,
but I wished he did. I...

766
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,560
For, like, a... a moment...

767
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:33,160
for a moment,
it felt like my husband was back,

768
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,320
and he

769
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,520
saw that I'm real, and I want that. I...

770
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,400
And I wished he did too.

771
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,440
[Cliff sniffles]

772
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,600

[breathing shakily]

774
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,280
[Cliff] I'm sorry.

775
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:31,800
Hey. [clears throat]

776
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:33,760
Listen.

777
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,120
What?

778
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,560
I wanted to apologize.

779
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,200
I overstepped the mark, and I apologize.

780
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,680
Nothing happened with Lana.

781
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,040
I know.

782
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,120
She wasn't interested.

783
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,400
Listen.

784
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:10,760
I know you don't want me
using your link anymore. It's just...

785
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:16,640
I'd like to apologize to her in person.

786
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,320
I owe her an apology too.

787
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,200
Hey. [clears throat]

788
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,160
Could I at least say goodbye to her?

789
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,160
I just wanna say goodbye.

790
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,480
That's not gonna happen.

791
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,280
You know what she told me?

792
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,640
That your visits offend her.

793
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,680
That <i>you </i>offend her.

794
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,360
The thought of you returning
makes her vomit.

795
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,520
She says that you're a snake.

796
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,440
A conman.

797
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,400
The worst kind.

798
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:52,640
The arrogant kind.

799
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,000
She won't have you anywhere near her.

800
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,000
She is mine.

801
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,640
For all time, she is mine.

802
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,560
Every day,

803
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:06,880
every night,

804
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,080
in every way.

805
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:13,880
You will not see or speak to her
ever again.

806
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,040
[razor clatters]

807
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,840

Damn it. Some kind of emergency.

812
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
What is it?

813
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,560
Small impact a few minutes ago.
Coolant tubing took a hit.

814
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:32,920
It's leaking pretty bad.

Hey, I'm at coolant four.

[breathing heavily]

822
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,920
No visible signs of damage.

823
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,280
David, you sure it was coolant four?

824
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,360
David?

825
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,360

Where the hell were you?

836
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:50,840
Bathroom.

837
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:52,640
The bathroom?

838
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,200
Coolant four was fine.

839
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:02,000
Goddamn system's
sending out false reports.

840
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,360
Gotta get on to McKenzie.

841
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,800
This is not acceptable.

842
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,200
Where's my tag?

843
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,400
My tag.

844
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,920
What did you do?

No, no, no, no.
