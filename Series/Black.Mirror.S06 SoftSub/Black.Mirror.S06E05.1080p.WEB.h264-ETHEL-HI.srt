00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,920
<i>We... we gotta work together.</i>

175
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,640
<i>- Can you pick me up?</i>
- [Nida whimpers]

176
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,560
<i>Come on, pick me up.</i>

177
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,960
<i>Just... just pick me up.</i>

178
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
<i>Please?</i>

179
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,640
<i>That's it. Come on. Come on.</i>

180
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,640
<i>I... I... I won't bite.</i>

181
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,920
<i>I promise. Come on.</i>

182
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,520
[clearly] <i>Right. So, as I was saying,
you anointed the talisman,</i>

183
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,600
<i>and the rules are you've gotta carry out
three human sacrifices</i>

184
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,000
<i>over the next three days</i>

185
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,600
<i>or else the world's gonna end.</i>

186
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
What?

187
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,120
<i>If you want me to help you,
you need to permit me entry.</i>

188
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Uh...

189
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,080
<i>Dost thou permit me entry? Yes or no?</i>

190
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
This isn't real.

191
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,240
<i>You have to say "yes."
Just say the word "yes." Say it.</i>

192
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,280
<i>If you say "yes," I'll... I'll stop, okay?
I'll go away.</i>

193
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,160
<i>You'll never hear from me again, like this
didn't happen. Just say "yes." Say it.</i>

194
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,440
<i>Say it. Come on, say it. Say it.
Say it! Say it! Say it!</i>

195
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,360
Yes!

196
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,080
[electrical buzzing]

197
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640
[whimpers]

198
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,600
- [unnatural deep breathing]
- [whimpers]

199
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,320
[Nida breathing anxiously]

200
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,760
[snarling]

201
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,960
- [breathes heavily]
- [yelping]

202
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,600
[Gaap] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come on. What's the matter?

203
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,040
[Nida whimpering]

204
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,640
[Gaap] All right, I gotta be honest.
I lied about going away.

205
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,440
Uh, hang on. Is it... is it these?

206
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,120
Yeah, yeah, sorry. My regular appearance
is probably a bit much for this realm.

207
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,680
- [breathing heavily]
- Uh, just a sec. [demonic echoing]

208
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,600
[breathes shakily]

209
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,800
[Gaap in normal voice]
This any better for ya?

210
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,960
I peered into your soul,

211
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,320
and apparently, this is a physical look
you find appealing, so...

212
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,280
Maybe you saw this recently and liked it?

213
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,120
I don't know. Let me have a look.

214
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
[snaps fingers]

215
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,680
Wow.

216
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,080
- Uh...
- [breathes shakily]

217
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,080
Okay. Am I, like, a clown?

218
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,000
[whimpers]

219
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,000
This how clowns dress in your realm?
I mean...

220
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,840
I mean, I can... I can work with it, but...

221
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,120
[chuckles] Uh...

222
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,240
[gasping]

223
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,680
You have got to get over the shock
and just talk to me.

224
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,840
You know, we have got to work together.

225
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
I'm dreaming.

226
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,200
Dream... You're really not, you know.

227
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
You're not real.

228
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,800
You're not real.
You're not real. You're not real.

229
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,120
[sniffles]

230
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
[panting]

231
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,800
[whimpers]

232
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,760
Hiya. Like I said,
we have got to work together.

233
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,000
It's blood and bone. You marked
the talisman. I don't make the rules.

234
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,080
I mean, basically, we need to deliver
three sacrifices by Maymass...

235
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,760
Uh, that's May Day to you. Or else it's...

236
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,480
Well, it's burning skies time.

237
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
[breathing heavily]

238
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,640
I sense you need some convincing.

239
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,160
Uh... [sighs]

240
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,320
Let me show you
how this will play out, all right?

241
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,480
What'll happen if we don't succeed.
You ready?

242
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Ready?

243
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,640
Three, two, one.

244
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,240
[high-pitched tone]

245
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
[gasps]

246
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
[siren blaring]

247
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,120
[Nida screaming]

248
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,680
- [siren stops]
- [gasping, coughing]

249
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,440
So, basically, this is the sort of thing
we're dealing with.

250
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,280
- [siren blaring]
- [Nida coughing]

251
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,080
- [siren stops]
- Scorching wall of flame.

252
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,800
It's agonizing death for all, and so on.

253
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,880
[siren blaring]

254
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,000
- [siren stops]
- [Nida whimpering]

255
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,240
[siren blaring]

256
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,360
[whimpers in pain]

257
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
[people screaming]

258
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,040
- [siren stops]
- [Nida whimpering]

259
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,840
- [siren blaring]
- [screams]

260
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,440
- [siren stops]
- [Nida whimpering]

261
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,720
[whimpering]

262
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,560
[silence]

263
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,040
See, burning people, they do smell
like you'd expect, don't they?

264
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,480
Like a... a burger on a griddle.

265
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,760
It's quite nice
if you disassociate from it.

266
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,200
Mind you, the charred hair
really gets stuck in your throat.

267
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,120
To be honest, I don't want the apocalypse
to come about any more than you do.

268
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,040
So let's stop it happening, you and me.

269
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,000
All we have to do
is deliver three sacrifices in three days.

270
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,360
It's only three killings.

271
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,840
Like I said, animals don't count.
You have to do humans.

272
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,400
And there's gotta be a cadence to it.
One a day.

273
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,760
[chuckles] It's one kill a day. It... it's...

274
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,240
Wha... what?

275
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,920
[panting]

276
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,680
That is fewer people than die falling off
ladders in the same time period.

277
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,000
You'd be less lethal than a ladder.

278
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,040
If I talk to you, you're real,
so I'm not gonna talk to you.

279
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,960
Well, we started conversing already,
so that ship has sailed.

280
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,240
- No, it hasn't.
- Oh, oh, yes, it has.

281
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,200
- [Nida grunts]
- Uh, don't worry. We're a team.

282
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,960
I'm on your side here, you know?

283
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,360
Let's just get kill number one
under your belt. Start racking 'em up.

284
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,880
You can stop it
because I am not killing anyone.

285
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,240
[Nida continues indistinctly]

286
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,120
...so I don't know
why you keep talking to me!

287
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,040
That's what I'm here for.
All right? Moral support.

288
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,160
So just hold on to that brick.
Let's go thwack someone.

289
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,800
- What brick?
- The one in your hand, love.

290
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,160
[Nida gasps]

291
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,440
I'm not doing what you say.

292
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
What's that, love?

293
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,080
[Gaap] Oh yeah.

294
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,280
Yeah, he's perfect.

295
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,600
There's no witnesses.

296
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,400
- Talk about beginner's luck.
- [Nida] No.

297
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,720
One quick pop to the head and you're done.

298
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,520
Please, make him stop.

299
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,120
Make who stop?

300
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,720
Love? Are you all right?

301
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,360
- I need a doctor.
- You want me to go and call one?

302
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,400
Would it help if I told you
I can see into this man's soul,

303
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,160
and he absolutely deserves to die?

304
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,880
- Shut up!
- [Gaap] He's got a daughter.

305
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Her name's Laura. She's eight years old.

306
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,000
Do you wanna know what he does to her?
To Laura?

307
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,560
- No, I don't wanna know.
- Sorry, love. I don't follow.

308
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,120
He pays Laura a little nighttime visit...

309
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
[Nida] Shut up!

310
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,880
[man] Is everything okay?

311
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,200
Do you wanna know how the bastard
makes her feel? Get a load of this.

312
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,640
[unsettling music playing]

313
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
[gasps]

314
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,360
[whimpers]

315
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,000
She kills herself, aged 28,
exhausted by the pain and the shame of it.

316
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,200
[gasps]

317
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,640
Maybe put that down.

318
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,160
[man grunts]

319
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,320
[dog barking]

320
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
[gasps]

321
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
[dog sniffing, whimpers]

322
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,800
[retching]

323
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,280
[retching, coughing]

324
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
[groans]

325
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,320
Yeah, it does take some getting used to,
I'll grant you that.

326
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,720
But a couple more of those
and I'll be out of your hair. [chuckles]

327
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Look, hang on.

328
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,600
Uh... Yeah, yeah. Look, see? One line gone.

329
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,640
That's one sacrifice registered.
Two to go.

330
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,000
You've got a whole day
to pick the next one.

331
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,640
Oh, come on. You...

332
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,920
You forgot to flush.

333
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,320
Oof. Fuck me.

334
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,240
[indistinct chattering]

335
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,520
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

336
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,600
- [man] What is it, Suz?
- A missing person.

337
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,520
[man] Boy or girl?

338
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,440
A 39-year-old man.

339
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,240
A Tim Simons.

340
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,440
No, don't know him.

341
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,576
[Suzie] His wife said
he didn't come home last night.

342
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,200
Yeah, because he's on the piss.

[Gaap sighs]

694
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,880
No.

695
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,080
Yeah, yeah. I get it. I get it.

696
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,680
[phone clatters]

697
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,240
- Keith didn't count.
- What?

698
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,840
- Why?
- He's a murderer.

699
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,400
Makes him ineligible.
That's what they're saying.

700
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,680
But we've been picking people
who deserve it.

701
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,080
You're not strictly
supposed to do it that way. I just...

702
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,240
I thought you'd find it easier.

703
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,360
I mean, the first bloke,
the one by the canal,

704
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,880
they're giving us that one 'cause
he's never actually killed anybody, but...

705
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,840
What about what he did to his daughter?

706
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,200
You said she kills herself at 28,
thanks to him.

707
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,560
Yeah, but that's in the future.

708
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,520
I'm sorry.

709
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,480
Look, basically, anyone
who's already been directly responsible

710
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,800
for the death of another human being,
they're off-limits.

711
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,960
Once that's happened,
as far as my boss is concerned,

712
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,680
they're playing for the home team.

713
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,280
You know, we're actually lucky

714
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,040
that Keith's brother
turned up just before midnight.

715
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,960
It would've been Armageddon otherwise.

716
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,880
Look, you did well.

717
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,560
Oh, absolutely go fuck yourself!

718
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,560
Right up a tree!

719
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,840
- This is all right for you.
- It isn't.

720
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,240
No blood on your hands.
You're just watching.

721
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,800
Light entertainment.

722
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,600
If the apocalypse does come,
you'll have a big fun finale.

723
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,240
- That'd be upending the whole place...
- It's frowned upon. You get told off.

724
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,080
- If I fail my initiation...
- [Nida laughs]

725
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,040
Kicked out of demon school? Boo-hoo.

726
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,920
- More like cast out.
- Whatever.

727
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,120
Cast out into a boundless, cosmic void.

728
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,720
And doomed to spend eternity
in a vacuum of infinite nothingness.

729
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,840
Absence of matter, of time,
of space, light, and sound.

730
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,240
I would endure a profound, palpable,

731
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,360
and ever-present lack of existence,

732
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,320
alone in perpetuity,

733
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,440
forever more.

734
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,000
Sounds like my life.

735
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,440
To be honest, I'm scared.

736
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,280
So one more victim, then.

737
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,600
Yeah, only thing for it.

738
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,840
- I can't be doing a total innocent.
- It's just murderers we have to avoid.

739
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,280
You mean people like me.

740
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,880
My whole life,
I never wished harm on anyone.

741
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,960
[Gaap scoffs]

742
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,160
I didn't.

743
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,360
Uh...

744
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,520
You couldn't have summoned me
for my trial if you hadn't.

745
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,240
Well, you had to be corruptible,
not beyond corruption.

746
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,640
You know what? You must have had
some dark force inside you

747
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,400
when you touched the talisman.
There's no shame in it.

748
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,520
No, go on. Who pissed you off?

749
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,600
[eerie music playing]

750
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,120
[chilling music playing]

751
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,160
[chilling music continues]

752
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,720
[chilling music intensifies]

753
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,760
So I'm thinking just lure her
down to the basement on some pretense,

754
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,640
clock her on the stairwell,
and say she lost her step and fell.

755
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,840
[Vicky] Snap out of it.
You can deal with the kid out there.

756
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,120
Needs black shoes for a funeral.
They pulled her dad out of the canal.

757
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,000
I'd do it myself,
but she gives me the willies.

758
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,720
[muzak softly playing]

759
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,360
[Gaap] Well, she... she...
she's not in mourning.

760
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,800
Well, she's... she's not <i>not </i>mourning.

761
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,960
Happy it's finished. Sad he's dead. It...

762
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,360
But... it has finished.

763
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,080
You... you spared her
another five years of it.

764
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,720
A lifetime of therapy,

765
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,240
but a lifetime, nonetheless.

766
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,040
She's a mum at 29. A nan at 57.

767
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,480
Eh?

768
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,280
I just thought you'd like to know.

769
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,400
It's a good fit.

770
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,680
[man 1] And, of course, the final touch.

771
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,080
- [man 2] Colin, really? You...
- No, no, no, no, no.

772
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,736
- I insist. Too late.
- [man 2] Very well.

773
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,000
[man 1] Here we are in footwear.

774
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,560
This is Mr. Michael Smart.

775
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,520
You probably recognize him.
He's all set to be our next MP.

776
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,800
Well, with a little luck
and a following wind.

777
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,320
[both laughing]

778
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,920
- His father and I were at school together.
- Fuck me.

779
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,360
[man 1] He's been using my weekend cottage
as a base of operations.

780
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,520
- You can tell he's ex-military.
- [laughs]

781
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,760
Michael's got a big speech tonight
at the town hall.

782
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,600
I promised him a new suit and new shoes.

783
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,080
The finest that Possetts has to offer.
[whispers] On the house.

784
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,200
I've told him
he'll go out of business at this rate.

785
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,200
[both laughing]

786
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,400
Fuck me some more.

787
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,280
Well, I said I'd leave you in the hands
of our finest assistant, so, um...

788
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,720
Vicky, if you could take care of Michael.

789
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,480
Michael, enjoy Vicky's
more than capable hands.

790
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,720
- Hey, steady on there. Steady on.
- [Vicky] Won't you walk this way?

791
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,440
[Michael] I'll walk
however you want. [laughs]

792
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,800
For Christ's sake,
there's boxes all over the floor.

793
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,320
Would you pick up your bloody mess?

794
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,520
I'm thinking car park later.

795
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,840
Wait till he comes out. Reverse into him.

796
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,400
Pin him up against the wall.

797
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,400
Keep the pedal down
till you hear the stomach pop.

798
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,640
Eh? What do you think?

799
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,760
[Michael laughs]

800
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,160
- [Michael] I won't tell if you don't.
- What?

801
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,040
[Vicky, Michael laugh]

802
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,320
[Michael] I hope
I have your vote this week.

803
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,840
Afraid not. National Front for me.

804
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,280
Oh!

805
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,360
Why is that?

806
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,920
Don't like how things
are changing around here.

807
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Mm.

808
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,560
My aunt, she's been in Cheetham 20 years.

809
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,320
Now she's got them living either side.

810
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,160
That's what's next.
We've not got a pot to piss in,

811
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,520
so why should we share with them
who don't belong?

812
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,240
You think voting National Front will help?

813
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,960
I think they'll stand up for us.

814
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,560
Says so
right on the front of their leaflet.

815
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,240
But they won't get elected.

816
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,560
- They might.
- They're too overt.

817
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,520
People feel it's, um,

818
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,240
bad manners.

819
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,200
[inhales]

820
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,600
You know why I don't print
"stop immigration"

821
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,680
in gigantic letters
on my campaign literature?

822
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,800
Because look at me.

823
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,640
Look at me!

824
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,720
[unsettling music playing]

825
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,680
You know what I stand for.

826
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,720
So,

827
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,480
do I have your vote?

828
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,240
Yes, sir.

829
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Good girl.

830
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,400
[Gaap] So, who are you gonna kill,
your boss or Vicky? You haven't got long.

831
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,360
What's his future? Michael Smart?

832
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,600
- Uh, it...
- Can you show me his future?

833
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,840
- Yeah, but let's not...
- Then show me right now.

834
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,080
Or I'll run out there,
confess to everything,

835
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,640
and then it's over,
and then you're fucked.

836
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,040
[sighs]

837
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,360
Show me.

838
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,800
- [male announcer] <i>16,472 votes.</i>
- [audience clapping]

839
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,720
[Michael] <i>Not just different,
they're inferior.</i>

840
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,056
[man] <i>...expelled from the Tories,</i>

841
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,200
<i>Michael Smart launched
his new Britannia party.</i>

842
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,920
The rivers of blood are here!

<i>Reclaim your power.</i>

<i>The land is ours.</i>

<i>I've seen what's coming.</i>

848
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,160
Rising seas, burning sky.

849
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,760
We are at war.

850
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,840
[crowd cheering]

851
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,080
[gasping]

852
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,760
He's fucking Satan.

853
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,880
[Gaap] No, he's not one of ours,
not literally.

854
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,320
I mean, they do like him.
They're fans of his work, you might say.

855
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,400
He's got to go.

856
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,360
- He's next.
- Oh, uh, they are not gonna like that.

857
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,920
Just avoid murderers.
You said that was the one rule.

858
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,240
Right, but he's responsible
for an impressive number of juicy deaths...

859
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,640
Not yet he isn't.

860
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,240
Right, but he... he... he beats his wife.

861
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,000
- Hasn't killed her, though, has he?
- I mean...
