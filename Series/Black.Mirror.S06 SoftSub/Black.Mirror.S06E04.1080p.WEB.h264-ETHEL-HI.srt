177
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,960
[exhales]

178
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,640
[TV announcer] <i>It's been two whole weeks
since Mazey Day,</i>

179
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,640
<i>star of the </i>EverWish <i>saga,</i>

180
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,360
<i>abruptly left the set
of the third installment of the franchise.</i>

181
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,720
<i>No one has seen her...</i>

182
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,400
- [Nathan] I... I heard you come in.
- Yeah.

183
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,440
This is really hard for me.

184
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,480
I'm not good at confrontation,
so my therapist

185
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,880
suggested that I use cue cards.

186
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,560
And...

187
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,760
[Nathan clears throat] Mm.

188
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,120
"As you know,
your share of the rent is late."

189
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,520
"And I have noticed groceries disappearing

190
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,960
from my clearly marked personal shelf
in the fridge."

191
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,400
- "While I truly value our friendship..."
- Nathan.

192
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,320
Please.

193
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,160
"I do not feel it is appropriate for me
to financially support..."

194
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,400
Nathan.

195
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
I'll get the money.

196
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
[exhales]

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Thank you.

198
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,800
All right, that's Erika and Brad.
Have a nice day, y'all.

199
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
'Sup, Bo?

200
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,560
Haven't you heard? No dogs allowed.

201
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,680
Meow.

202
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,200
You got a minute?

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,840
Like I said, Hec, I'm out.

204
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,360
I'm not trying to tempt you back in.

205
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,960
Yeah, 'cause you're scared
of the competition.

206
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,160
[scoffs]

207
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,440
Maybe I respect your decision.
Thought about that?

208
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,080
So, why are you here?

209
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,120
I thought that maybe
you could help me with something.

210
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,480
Help you with what?

211
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,560
Mazey Day.

212
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,200
The actress.

213
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,200
Yeah, Mazey Day. What about her?

214
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,440
You know, she's filming
in Czechoslo-somewhere, one of those.

215
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,080
Started day drinking. Erratic behavior.
Stopped showing up to set.

216
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,320
Angry one day, fucking weeping the next.
Basically gone fucking wacko.

217
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,320
So, that's your professional
psychiatric opinion of the situation?

218
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,800
She got kicked off the movie set
two weeks ago,

219
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,080
flew home, and no one's seen her since.

220
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,360
Not home, nowhere.

221
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,640
So, everybody's cool
with leaving her alone, then?

222
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,480
Nick's offering 30K
for the first photo of her.

223
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,480
- 30K?
- 30K.

224
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,600
Forty if you catch her
looking like a junkie.

225
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,000
I've been hitting up all my peeps, but

226
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,080
no leads. Nothing. Nada.

227
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,760
You, um, still keep in touch
with your snitch?

228
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,560
I took his number off my phone.

229
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,160
All right, well, if you happen to find
that you wrote it somewhere,

230
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,040
let me know.

231
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040

- <i>Hey, stranger.</i>

235
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,960
Um... [clears throat]

236
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,520
- Have you heard anything on Mazey Day?
- <i>Thought you'd given up on all this.</i>

237
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,040
Yeah, this could be
the kind of payday I could use.

238
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,480
<i>Look, I only know
what everyone else knows.</i>

239
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,480
<i>She's not at home.
Gotta be holed up somewhere, but no clue.</i>

240
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
All right, cool.

241
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,720
Uh, let me know if that changes.

242
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,880
[woman] Hello? Food delivery.

243
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,440
Oh, I think I have some money in my purse.

244
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,520
It's okay.

245
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,320
Mr. G said
while you're a guest in his house,

246
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,200
he's left money to cover everything.

[dial-up internet static]

250
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,040
So, she still has a membership,
but she hasn't been since when?

251
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,080
You haven't seen her in a while.

252
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,040
You can give me a call
if she pops by again.

253
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,640
Let me know if that changes.

254
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,480
You can call me here if anything changes.
Thank you. Bye.

255
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,640
[pensive music continues]

256
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,200
[whispers] Where the fuck are you?

257
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,960
Hmm.

[pensive music fades]

259
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,880
Mazey Day's a fan, huh?

260

[Bo chuckles]

261
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,560
She says she orders here every week?

262
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,680
Mm-hmm.

263
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,040
- Come on.
- [woman] She still does.

264
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,520
Saw her yesterday.

265
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
[Bo] Really?

266
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,400
[woman] She's staying
at some, like, producer's house.

[camera shutter clicks]

283
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,320
[man] The first step is to recognize

284
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,760
that you're not in control of this.

285
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,800
It has taken you over.

286
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,320
And you must be humble

287
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,360
in the face of it.

288
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
Hm?

289
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,320
I've arranged a place
where we can take you.

290
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,800
Private, out of town, just for a few days.

291
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,000
You need isolation.

292
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,560
Away from anyone

293
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,720
and anything.

294
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,080

Can you get me better?

296
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,880
Well, it's about
getting you through tonight.

297
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,400
And then the next night.

298
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,480
Then we see.

299
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
Okay.

300
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,200
Absolutely not.

326
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,920
I'm guessing you could use a coffee.

327
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Or a beer?

328
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,760
Coffee's fine.

329
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Coffee it is.

330
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,360
Do you know anyone with a tow truck
around here?

331
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,960
- Car trouble?
- Yeah.

332
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,880
Uh, Mitch runs the repair shop in town,
but he came by here this morning.

333
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,280
He'll be gone for the day.

334
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,160
Would he come if I called him?

No, I mean, you know...

00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,040
Is there a motel within crawling distance?

340
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,440
Uh, the only place near here
is the Cedar Wood Retreat.

341
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,120
That's really more of a rehab place.

342
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,480
A rehab?

343
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,960
Yeah, but for, like,
rich hippie types, you know?

344
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,240
It's a little New Age for my blood.

345
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,040
Maybe they have a bed for the night?

346
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,600
Yeah, you got no chance of that.

347
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,280
Uh, Kyle, that's my uncle,
most days he's a masseuse there.

348
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,520
He says someone hired the entire complex
for the weekend.

The whole place?

350
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,760
All the staff sent home,

351
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,160
so it's empty, ultra-private.

352
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,880
The whole place
for, like, one person the whole time.

353
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,360
Any clue who the one person is?

354
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,120
Someone rich who wants to get straight
on the down-low.

That's a long-ass ride.
No time for a soda?

You want a soda, or you want Mazey Day?

363

Yeah, that's what I thought. Thank you.

No, they're just keeping

It's gotta be Mazey Day, right?

Ah, the big addiction guy.
My guess says she's on crystal meth.

00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,360
They think, "Oh, well,
you just drop it in the deep fryer." No.

531
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,080
It's not about frying chicken.
You're gonna sauté it, bake it...

532
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,120
But it's gotta be done, you know...

533
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,200
Because you undercook it, and, you know,

534
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,680
people die.

535
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,280
- [Bo panting]
- Lock it.

536
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,360
- Whoa, whoa! What...
- [Bo whimpers]

537
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
- [Terry] What...
- Okay.

538
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,760
[Terry] Are you okay? What...

539
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,520
[grunting]

540
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,520
What is...

541
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,560
It could come in. It's out there!

542
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,920
It could be coming this way!
We need to block the door!

543
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,840
Ma'am. What has happened?

544
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,160
- Ma'am, calm down.
- Officer. Please just call for help.

545
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,160
- Calm down.
- [Bo] Call for help! Call for help!

546
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,376
- I will momentarily, ma'am, but first...
- [Bo] Please.

547
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,000
- Fucking call for help!
- Calm down.

548
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,760
Take a few deep breaths, settle down,
and explain to me what has happened.

549
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,160
Then maybe we can figure out
how we're gonna move forward.

550
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,320
[Bo] No, just please
fucking call for help!

551
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,536
- [Clay] I will do that momentarily, ma'am.
- She's here.

552
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,120
But first, I need to understand...

553
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,520
No, no, no, no!

554
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,480
- Okay, back up!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Officer. Sir.

555
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,440
- Stay down. Stay down.
- No, you don't under...

556
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,120
Officer! Officer! It's out there, Officer!

557
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,840
You need to call for backup, Office...

558
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,360
- [Jesse screams]
- [dishes clattering]

559
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
[Bo gasps]

560
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,880
[tense music playing]

561
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,960
[Terry] Hey, Jesse, you okay?

562
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,280
Jesse?

563
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,000
[woman gasps softly]

564
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,440
[beast growls]

565
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,160
[man, woman screaming]

566
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,400
[blood squelching]

567
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,880
[woman] No!

568
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,000
[woman screaming]

569
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,480
[woman gasping, choking]

570
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,560
[Hector screams]

571
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
[Bo sobs]

572
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,320
[dishes clattering]

573
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,120
[Clay screaming]

574
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,200
[tense music swells]

575
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,680
[Bo screams]

576
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,440
[tense music subsides]

577
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
[labored breathing]

578
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,320
Hec. Hec.

579
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
[country music plays faintly]

580
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,560
[Hector gurgles]

581
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,040
[Mazey] Kill me.

582
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,960
Please.

583
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,520
Kill me.

584
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,560
[sobs]

585
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,120
Please.

586
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
[somber music playing]

587
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,840
Just... just shoot me.

588
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,120
[somber music continues]

589
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,440
[Mazey breathing heavily]

590
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
[somber music fades]

591
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,880
[gunshot]

592
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,240
[tense music playing]

593
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,640
[tense music fades]
