Okay? This is the TV. I didn't say this.

351
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,960
- Fuck.
- Krish?

352
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,120
- [TV Joan] <i>I haven't gotten over Mac.</i>
- Krish!

353
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,400
[TV Joan] <i>I think maybe</i>

354
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,080
<i>I don't want to.</i>

355
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,080
Oh Christ.

356
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,840
Hey. What she said on the show,
that's not what I think.

357
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,160
- Okay?
- No.

358
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
Some of the details...

359
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,840
The whole thing,
it's blown out of proportion, okay?

360
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,920
I didn't say that to my therapist.

361
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,880
So, what did you say?

362
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
I...

363
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,200
[Krish] Mm-hmm.

364
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,640
- [Krish grunts]
- Krish.

365
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
[Krish grunts]

366
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,000
Krish! Where are you going?

367
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,120
I don't know.

368
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,400
- I don't know. I gotta go.
- Krish, come on. Please, please!

369
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,656
[TV Mac] <i>I'm here three days...</i>

370
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,976
- Hey!
- ...<i>then back to San Jose.</i>

371
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
[Joan] I said...

372
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,560
<i>I can't leave Krish.</i>

373
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,120
<i>Can't you?</i>

374
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,280
[tense music playing]

375
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
[Joan gasps]

376
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,200
[TV Joan] <i>So, what do you wanna watch?</i>

377
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,600
Sea of Tranquility.

378
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,320
<i>Eh.</i>

379
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,760
<i>Eric says it blows.</i>

380
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,560
<i>Well, if Eric said...</i>

381
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,600
I never liked Krish.

382
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,680
Babe, wait. Come on, sit down. Babe.

383
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,320
Joan Is Awful?

384
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,640
[TV Joan] <i>Is that Cate Blanchett?</i>

385
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,400
- That's Cate Blanchett?
- Oh no.

386
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,120
- That's Cate Blanchett!
- That's good.

387
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,880
- [TV Joan] <i>That's not my hair.</i>
- She looks good!

388
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,000
Krish! It's a TV show. It's not real.

389
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,840
I don't know what's going on,
but none of that happened.

390
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,840
Krish, hey!
I haven't even seen Mac in so long.

391
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,080
Then show me your phone.

392
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,160
What?

393
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,160
In the TV show, Mac texted you,
and you texted him back, so

394
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,680
show me your phone.

395
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
It's...

396
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,880
it's in the house.

397
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,920
That's convenient, Joan.

398
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,320
[phone chimes]

399
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,840
- Goodbye.
- Krish.

400
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,000
Krish, please don't go.

401
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,680
Don't go. Please don't leave me by myself.
This is fucking insane. Please don't...

402
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,000
Krish! Please!

403
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Krish!

404
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,760
[TV Joan] <i>Krish, you're being childish.
Come back, please.</i>

405
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,760
<i>You're being very melodramatic.
It's uncalled for.</i>

406
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,640
<i>Oh my God. It's TV. It's not real!</i>

407
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,680
<i>My fidelity for you.
My fidelity for you, that's real.</i>

408
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,080
<i>That's television. Fake, not real.</i>

409
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,840
<i>If you weren't texting Mac,
show me your phone.</i>

410
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,360
<i>They're right about you, Joan.</i>

411
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
<i>You're awful.</i>

412
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,720
<i>Krish. I'm not that awful. It's not real.</i>

413
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,000
[phone ringing]

414
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,160
<i>Come back.</i>

415
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,680
<i>Krish! Don't leave me.</i>

416
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,600
<i>You know I can't be on my own.</i>

417
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,320
<i>- You can't leave me!</i>
- Mac.

418
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,320
- [exclaims]
- [TV Joan] <i>Krish!</i>

419
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
[exclaims]

420
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,000
[crying]

421
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,880
[crying]

422
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,160
[pensive music playing]

423
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,680
[phone alarm chimes]

424
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,240
[sighs]

425
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,560
[pensive music continues]

426
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,720
Shame on you.

427
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Oh fuck.

428
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
Oh God.

429
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
- Sorry I'm late.
- [Eric] Uh-huh.

430
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Did you see it?

431
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,520
Everybody saw it.

432
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,160
It's all anyone can talk about.

433
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,000
[exhales] How'd it come across?

434
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,760
Fair. Yeah. I just don't know
what this is.

435
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,560
My lawyer's looking into it.

436
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,200
- Krish is so mad at me.
- Joan.

437
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,960
- He walked out last night.
- Hey, Joan.

438
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,080
Everyone's looking at me
like I'm an actual monster.

439
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,200
Joan, just... just try and keep it together
for, like, the next few minutes.

440
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,600
[sighs] Why is Brutus here?

441
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,240
You let slip about the whole algorithm,
data server, carbon footprint thing

442
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,920
in the scene where you fired Sandy.

443
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,920
Technically, you broke your NDA.

444
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,360
What? That's not fair. That was...

445
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,640
That was Salma Hayek!

446
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,120
The board wants you out.

447
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,480
Now.

448
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,800
I'm here to help you pack.

449
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,760
Right on.

450
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,640
[Joan sniffles]

451
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,200
<i>Sayonara, queen.</i>

452
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,120
Mona.

453
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,400
"I'm in a pantsuit."

454
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,680
[breathes deeply]

455
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,200
Well, I've checked it over,

456
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,560
and I have to say that actually,

457
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,600
legally, the Streamberry Corporation
can do this.

458
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
What?

459
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,960
How?

460
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,040
Trust me, I'm as shocked as you are.

461
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,960
But the show is using my life.
It's... it's my name. It's my career.

462
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,640
It's me. They're... they're using me, so...

463
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,200
And you assigned them
the right to exploit all of that.

464
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,320
What? When?

465
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,520
Terms and conditions.

466
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,720
I have never seen this before.

467
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,800
[lawyer] You have. You just haven't
seen it printed out before.

468
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,560
All of that would have popped up
on your phone or whatever

469
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,280
when you first signed up to Streamberry.

470
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,280
And you clicked "accept."

471
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,920
What? I mean, I had...

472
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,760
I had no...
How was I supposed to know this?

473
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,080
I know. But you did accept it,
and so they're in the clear.

474
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,680
No, no. No, no, no.
They can't... they can't do this to me.

475
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,800
There are only so many ways
for me to tell you they absolutely can.

476
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,880
[exhales sharply]

477
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,800
Okay, well, Salma Hayek.

478
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,360
Yeah, pretty cool.

479
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,120
No. No, I'm gonna sue Salma Hayek.

480
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,040
For what?

481
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,240
[spluttering] For, like,
passing herself off as me.

482
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,560
She has no right to do that.

483
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,920
It's not really Salma Hayek.

484
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,840
Yes, it is.

485
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:46,600
No. Technically, uh, the show deploys
a digital likeness of Miss Hayek.

486
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,120
They don't film her.

487
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,360
She licensed her image to them.

488
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,120
The entire show is CGI.

489
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,520
It's generated by some kind
of super-advanced, deepfake,

490
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,280
quantum computer mumbo jumbo.

491
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,360
[exhales sharply]

492
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,960
They could make Salma Hayek
blow an orangutan if they wanted to.

493
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,320
[chuckling] Oh, whoa.

494
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,760
I'm guessing Miss Hayek might object
to that, but you get my point.

495
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,640
Right. So it's all... it's all computers?

496
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,120
That's how they get it
on the service so fast.

497
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,520
But how do they...

498
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,800
how do they even know what I'm doing?
It's the same... it's the same day.

499
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,680
Well, you know when you got your phone
face down on the table,

500
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,440
and you're in your kitchen,
and you're talking to your friend about,

501
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,400
I don't know, shoe deodorizers,

502
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,520
and then, you know, you go
on your computer and what pops up?

503
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,520
A shoe deodorizing ad.

504
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,240
Then you get an email,
and it's all about shoe deodorizing.

505
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,416
Then you're walking down the street,
shoe deodorizing.

506
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,000
You can't escape it. And it's...

507
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,640
Yeah, so?

508
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,080
Uh, that's how they know.

509
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,040
Okay, but...

510
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,960
[chuckles]

511
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:54,200
...but the show
makes stuff up about me. Right?

512
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,800
It embellishes things.

513
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,200
It makes me look worse than I really am.

514
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,640
So... [smacks table] ...defamation.

515
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,400
Yeah, page 53, paragraph 12.

516
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,920
There's something about
creating characters and dialogue

517
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,440
for dramatic purposes.

518
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
Fuck!

519
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,440
I agree.

520
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,920
Uh, I hate to say it,
but this thing is... is watertight.

521
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,040
Oh my God.

522
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,800
They got you every which way
and then some.

523
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,000
My advice is to try and ignore it.

524
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,800
What the fuck kind of advice is that?

525
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,640
It's the only kind I got.

526
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,240
Oh my God.

527
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,040
[Joan laughing] Okay.

528
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,880
Hi, guys!

529
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,000
Hey, how you doing out there?

530
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,800
Cool! Fuck!

531
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,840
[pensive music playing]

532
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,840
Sorry, do I know you?

533
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,920
[groaning angrily]

534
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,840
[TV Joan] <i>This show, it is using my life,
my name, my career.</i>

535
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,720
<i>You assigned them
the right to exploit all of that.</i>

536
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,480
<i>When? How?</i>

537
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,120
<i>Terms and conditions.</i>

538
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,320
<i>I've never even seen this.</i>

539
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,640
- <i>I would've known if I signed it.</i>
- This is brutal.

540
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,640
<i>I would've known I'd signed something
I didn't read. Who has time to read that?</i>

[knocking at door]

542
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,440
[TV lawyer] <i>You did accept it though.</i>

543
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,880
- [TV Joan] <i>What?
- Yeah, they're in the clear.</i>

544
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,696
- [TV Joan] <i>They can't do this to me.</i>
- Oh, hey.

545
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,480
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, yeah.

546
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,280
Hey, uh...

547
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,640
<i>They cannot...</i>

548
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,080
There. Sorry.

00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
[crying]

550
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,800
Oh, baby.

551
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
Honey.

552
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,720
[Joan crying]

553
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,320
[Mac] You're okay.

554
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,280
[Joan sobs]

555
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,520
No...

[Joan breathing heavily]

558
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
What's wrong?

559
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,960
Um,

560
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,400
I can't get hard.

561
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,560
Sure you can.

562
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,280
Hey, you want me to do
that horrible thing you love?

563
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
It's, um...

564
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,000
It's... This is so public.

565
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,960
What do you mean?

566
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,320
This is gonna be on the show.

567
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,720
Okay, but it's not us.
It's... it's computer people.

568
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,080
- It's Salma Hayek and...
- Well, yeah, I know.

569
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,840
So, I mean, like, I'm gonna be the guy
who can't get it up for Salma Hayek?

570
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,520
I mean, it's like...

571
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,720
You know, it's one thing to not be able
to get it up for, like, you,

572
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
but Salma Hayek?

573
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,920
I mean, look,
people are gonna laugh at me.

574
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,440
The show is called fucking <i>Joan Is Awful.</i>
How do you think I feel?

575
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,680
Hey! Look, when I said
I wanted to get back together with you...

576
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,360
When you basically <i>begged </i>me
to get back together with you.

577
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,960
But I didn't agree to be a public figure.

578
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,000
Neither did I!

579
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,160
Except you did.

580
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,600
Page 58 of the terms and conditions.

581
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,840
They just said so on the show!

582
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,920
Joan, I always said
you gotta read the terms and conditions.

583
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,120
<i>I can sue Cate Blanchett.</i>

584
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,240
[scoffs] <i>Uh, for what?</i>

585
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,600
<i>For passing herself off as me.</i>

586
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,520
<i>That isn't the real Cate Blanchett.</i>

587
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,880
<i>The show just deploys
a digital likeness of Miss Blanchett.</i>

588
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,280
<i>The whole show is CGI.</i>

589
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,080
<i>It's generated by a quantum computer.</i>

590
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:10,000
<i>They could... </i>[chuckles] <i>...make her
blow an orangutan if they wanted.</i>

591
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,440
<i>Although I am guessing the real
Miss Blanchett might object to that,</i>

592
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,760
<i>but you get my point.</i>

593
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,920
[tense music playing]

594
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,840
Hmm.

601
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,640
Okay.

[tense music continues]

603
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,080
[priest] Anyone knows a reason
why these two may not be wed,

604
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,040
let him speak now.

[guests groaning in disgust]

611
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
What are you doing?!

00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,400
[Joan groaning]

613
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
Stop!

[screaming]

615
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,800

- Get out of here!

00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,080
- [camera shutter clicks]
- [laughs]

619
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,640
What's so funny?

620
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,720
[camera shutter clicks]

621
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,200
Salma Hayek's gonna fucking hate this.

622
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
[photographer] Why?

623
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,520
Have you not seen <i>Joan Is Awful?</i>

624
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,000
No, but it's on my list.

625
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,920
Just wait till episode four.
I hear it's gonna be a blast.

626
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,400
Her lawyer's here. Posted bail.

627
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,840
- Uh...
- You're free to go.

628
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,960
Oh.

629
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,000
[female officer] For now.

630
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,920
[laughs]

631
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,400
You're disgusting.

632
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,360
Thank you.

[Joan laughing]

641
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,720
[wedding scene playing on laptop]

642
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,960
[Hayek] Never in my wildest nightmares

643
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,440
I thought I'd see myself
defecating in a church.

644
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:25,080
Well, technically,
that's the Joan character, not you.

645
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,840
So this character,
whose face do they have?

646
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,680
Do they have your face or my face?

647
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,120
Your face.

648
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,960
Salma Hayek's face.

649
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,600
So, then,
whose anus is doing the shitting?

650
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,680
Uh,

651
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,600
Salma Hayek's anus?

652
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,960
Bingo.

653
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,520
I am Roman Catholic.

654
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,360
My grandmother Rosa was going to be a nun.

655
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,280
She might die when she sees this.

656
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,760
What right do they have to kill my <i>abuela</i>

657
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,760
with this deepfake heretic abomination?

658
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,240
Uh, page 39, paragraph eight.

659
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,440
Paragraph eight can suck my dick.
I don't even know what it says anyway.

660
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,120
Uh, your image rights agreement
with Streamberry.

661
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,640
It's page 39, paragraph eight.

662
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,840
Specifically covers any acts or behaviors
Joan may exhibit

663
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,320
up to, including, and beyond defecation.

664
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,160
Beyond defecation?

665
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,760
Beyond. That's what it says.

666
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,840
You know I don't read this crap.

667
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,720
I am a dyslexic, talented actress
with questionable English.

668
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,120
- That's why I overpay <i>you </i>to protect <i>me.</i>
- Okay.

669
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,400
I mean, doesn't my asshole
have any rights?

670
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,680
- Okay. All right.
- [exhales] Okay, okay.

671
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,360
Okay.

672
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
Okay.

673
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,320
Let's collect ourselves, and, uh...

674
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,400
Good.

675
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,840
...brainstorm so we can do
some damage control.

676
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,800
So, what can you do

677
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,240
to erase this image
from every machine in the world?

678
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,320
[clears throat]

679
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,920
Nothing.

680
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,040
Okay.

681
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,760
Then I guess I'm just gonna have to settle
for a huge lawsuit against them.

682
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,040
Um, I've looked up and down
and researched,

683
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,000
and there is no legal basis.

684
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,840
There's no way we can sue these guys.

685
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,680
Then I'm gonna sue you.

686
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,320
You sold me out.

687
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,440
You useless, overrated maggot.

688
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,560
You take your paragraph eight

689
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,440
and shove it up your ass!

690
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,920
And I hope that you get paper cuts
in your hemorrhoids and die!

691
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,960
You're fired!

692
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,320
- [doorbell ringing]
- [snorts]

693
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
[confused moan]

694
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,760
What the fuck?

695
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,680
I...

696
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,680
I didn't, uh, actually think
that you would come to...

697
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,240
Welcome to my home.

698
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,680
- I understand that you're mad.
- Oh, do you?

699
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,400
Please don't kill me, Salma Hayek.

700
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,560
You're lucky I'm a humanitarian.

701
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,000
Let's have a talk.

702
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,920
[inaudible] What the fuck?

703
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,080
- Come on!
- Coming!

704
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,800
Oh my goodness me.

705
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,680
Oh my God.

706
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,920
Now it all makes sense.
Look at all this shit!

707
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,280
What's wrong with you, girl?

708
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,640
I mean, must you be so disgusting?

709
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,400
I mean, the last few days
have been pretty rough, so...

710
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,200
Rough enough to take a dump
in the house of God?

711
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,280
If you don't have any self-respect,
that's your thing.

712
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,120
But to disrespect the church,

713
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,640
and frankly, to disrespect my image...

714
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,320
- Mm-hmm.
- ...I don't wanna be associated with you.

715
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,600
Well, I don't wanna be
associated with me either.

716
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,480
They took my life.
They turned it into a CGI fucking drama.

717
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,040
I lose my fiancé.

718
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,360
I lose my job.

719
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,560
They put my entire existence out there
for everyone to watch,

720
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,600
and you signed up to be the face of it.

721
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,920
You're a fucking enabler.
I should be yelling at <i>you.</i>

722
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,240
- You are yelling at me.
- Well, I need to yell at someone!

723
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,320
Well, it's not fair
that you're taking it all out on me.

724
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:48,800
I am sorry that I shat in a church.

725
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,360
Okay?

726
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,680
But I was trying to get your attention

727
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,960
so that you'd get in touch
with Streamberry

728
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,120
and have them pull the plug on the show.

729
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,560
I already made that call.

730
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,360
- And?
- They told me to go fuck myself.

731
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,440
They did?

732
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,000
Can you believe it?

733
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,840
So, you can't stop this?

734
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,520
I thought for once I was gonna have
control over my own image.

735
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,920
But those fuckers lied about everything.

736
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,520
First, they told me
this was gonna be a prestige show, right?

737
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,160
Look, I didn't think it was gonna be
like my movie <i>Frida,</i>

738
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,080
but I couldn't imagine
that it was gonna be this.

739
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:31,000
And then they said
that they were closing the pay gap.

740
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,400
Bullshit!

741
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,400
They are paying me one-tenth
of what they're paying George Clooney.

742
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,360
Sorry, George Clooney
is gonna be in this show?

743
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,280
No, they're sticking his head
on a <i>Thomas the Tank Engine </i>reboot.

744
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,960
Wait.

745
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,600
How much are they paying you?

746
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,680
Oh,

747
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,600
nothing.

748
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,080
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

749
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,280
That is so fucked up.

750
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,200
Yeah.

751
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,720
Well, they're screwing us both.

752
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,800
Yeah.

753
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,720
I mean, how do you think
Cate Blanchett feels about this?

754
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,920
Fuck her.

755
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,480
This is the bad guy.

756
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,640
Mona Giovanni.

757
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,800
- [Joan] Javadi.
- Whatever.

758
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,000
And the whole Strawberry machine.

759
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,320
It's Streamberry.

760
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,320
They have taken 100 years of cinema

761
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,040
and diminished it to an app.

762
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:30,200
I wanna go and take that computer

763
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,400
and rip the cables out of it

764
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,520
and stick them up its ass.

765
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,280
Let's bring down the system.
The quamputer thing.

766
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,480
Oh yeah, let's.

767
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,960
Are you a hacker?

768
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,280
No, no, no, no, no.
I mean, like, physically.

769
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,760
So it says the server's
outside of Mona Javadi's office.

770
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,720
So we just get in there and fucking...

771
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,280
- You know?
- Her office is all the way at the top.

772
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,200
We can't crawl on the side of the building
like Spider-Mans.

773
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,120
No, no, no, we don't have to.

774
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,520
'Cause you can just
walk in the front door.

775
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,840
We can't just do that.

776
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,800
You can

777
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,440
because you're Salma fucking Hayek.

778
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,240
Thank you.

779
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,480
You're right.

780
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,920
Yeah.

781
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,840
I am Salma fucking Hayek.

782
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,520
[suspenseful music playing]

783
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,360
[Hayek] Good morning.

784
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,000
Hi. Hello. Miss Hayek.

785
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,600
I have an appointment with Mona Javadi.

786
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,400
Of course. Let me just...

787
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,800
[secretary] Uh, I can't, um...

788
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,760
- It should be in the system. Please do...
- Excuse me, is there a restroom I can use?

789
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,800
Of course. Right over there.

790
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,160
I'm afraid that's too public.

791
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,520
Thanks to your show,

792
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,840
every time people see me
go into one of those,

793
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,400
all they can think about
is hot <i>birria </i>coming out of my bottom.

794
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,320
Of course.

795
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,360
Can we swipe Miss Hayek through?

796
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,880
There is a private restroom
down the corridor on the right.

797
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,520
Thank you.

798
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,720
And don't worry, I'm just gonna pee.

799
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,120
Okay.

800
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,880
Cool.

801
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,360
Thank you.

802
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,160
All right, just one sec. Yeah. We're good.

803
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,120
- You rolling?
- Yeah.

804
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,040
Great.

805
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,760
- So, Miss Javadi.
- Mm.

806
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,000
A lot going on here at Streamberry.
Loads of heat around your new show.

807
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,600
- [clears throat]
- I know, right?

808
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,376
- Bet you've got a heap of questions.
- Yeah.

809
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,920
[clears throat, coughs]

810
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,080
- Lucy, I'm in the middle of an interview.
- I think it might be important.

811
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,920
Sorry.

812
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,280
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Yes?

813
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,800
Apparently, Salma Hayek's downstairs
asking to see you.

814
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,200
- Didn't we tell her to go fuck herself?
- Maybe that's why.

815
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,400
Just get security to chuck her out.

816
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,600
Sorry, sorry. She's new.

817
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,480
- Yeah.
- Don't know how long she'll last.

818
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,240
Anyway, where were we?

819
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,560
<i>- Joan Is Awful.
- Joan Is Awful.</i>

820
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,640
[tense music playing]

821
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,360
[door lock beeps]

822
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,160
- What are you wearing?
- It's a disguise.

823
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,560
Take it off. They're gonna think
you're kidnapping me.

824
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,640
Okay.

825
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,280
- Hurry up!
- Okay!

826
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,320
[tense music continues]

827
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,920
Come on!

828
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:59,760
So, here at Streamberry, we are passionate
about creating new forms of entertainment.

829
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,440
This whole floor is dedicated
to content generation R&D.

830
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,280
Experimental entertainment,
computer-generated material.

831
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,720
[interviewer] Like <i>Joan Is Awful.</i>

832
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,800
[Mona] Exactly.

833
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,800
Shut up, shut up.

834
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,480
[Mona] And that is made by this,
the quamputer,

835
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,880
which is actually
just down that corridor on the left.

836
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,800
[interviewer] A kind of quantum computer.

837
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,680
Yeah, hence the name.

838
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,240
An infinite content creator

839
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:30,080
capable of willing entire multiverses
into existence, right?

840
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,320
And within those rendered worlds,

841
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,840
shooting, packaging,
and editing fully-edited programs

842
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,680
that would normally take months
to make, such as...

843
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,560
[interviewer] <i>Joan Is Awful.</i>

844
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,520
I wish they'd stop saying that.

845
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,560
- [Mona] Correct.
- [whispers] I like the picture.

846
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,080
And the role Salma's depicting
is based on a real Joan, right?

847
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,800
Mm-hmm. Yep.

848
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,840
Why that particular woman?
What's so special about her?

849
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,160
Absolutely nothing.

850
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,320
We were looking for a totally average,
nobody person,

851
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,040
just... just to test the system.

852
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,240
The point is,
<i>Joan Is Awful </i>is just the beginning.

853
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,400
The aim here is to launch
unique, tailored content

854
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,080
to each individual in our database,
all 800 million of them,

855
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,920
created on the fly by our system.
The most relatable content imaginable.

856
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,320
Actually, there's one for you.

857
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,240
I couldn't resist. Yeah.

858
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,800
This is actually real and will be
available to stream from Friday.

859
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,520
[uncomfortable chuckle]

860
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,160
Uh, why "awful"?

861
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,520
Why is it all so negative?

862
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,080
Yeah. No, that's a great question, Fatima.

863
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,000
Um, we did try more affirmative content
in the test cell,

864
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,120
but we found
that, um, our subjects just didn't buy it.

865
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,360
It didn't chime
with their neurotic view of themselves.

866
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,520
What we found instead
was when we focused on their more weak

867
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,440
or selfish or craven moments,

868
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,160
it confirmed their innermost fears

869
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,120
and put them in a state
of mesmerized horror.

870
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,680
Which really drives engagement.

871
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,040
They literally can't look away.

872
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,480
Let's kill this quam-<i>puta.</i>

873
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,640
- [Fatima] Wow. Great, thanks.
- [Mona] Did you get everything you need?

874
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,360
Okay. Where is she?
Hi, where is she? Where's Salma?

875
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,760
I let her go to the toilet.

876
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,000
How hard is it to find someone?
Most walls are glass.

877
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,240
Can you guys do something?

878
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,320
[tense music playing]

879
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,480
- [whispers] Is that it?
- It's locked.

880
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,560
There.

881
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,640
[door opens]

882
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,240
[Hayek] There it is.

883
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,920
Holy Christ!
Hey, no one's allowed in here!

884
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,160
I'm calling security!

885
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,080
If you call security,
I will break your arm.

886
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,560
Don't think I won't,
because I will, understood?

887
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,760
Yes, Miss Hayek.

888
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,080
[Hayek] Okay.

889
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,600
How do we get in here?

890
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,480
[Joan] What's that?

891
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,080
<i>Joan Is Awful.</i>

892
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,880
No, but that's me. That should be

893
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,800
her, right?

894
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,520
That's the variant of <i>Joan Is Awful</i>
that the Joan below you sees

895
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,440
when she watches the show.

896
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,800
What? The Joan below me?

897
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,040
You're not the original Joan.
That's Source Joan.

898
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,680
We need a code for this, Joan.

899
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,800
Wait, sh.

900
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,720
"Source Joan"?

901
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,680
Yeah, you're just <i>a </i>Joan.

902
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,000
Who's Source Joan?

903
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,360
The real Joan.

904
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,760
Look, there. Source Joan.

905
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,600
[Joan] Source Joan?

906
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,040
I'm not the real Joan?

907
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,080
You're a version of Joan

908
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,720
played by a digital likeness
of Annie Murphy.

909
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,720
- Who's Annie Murphy?
- The actress.

910
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,080
There. Look familiar?

911
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,480
<i>Schitt's Creek. </i>No? Great show.

912
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,120
- You're playing an adaptation of Joan.
- No, no.

913
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,760
Look. Source Joan lives in reality.

914
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,560
When Source John watches the TV show
<i>Joan Is Awful, </i>she sees you playing her.

915
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,320
That show is the fictive level
we're on right now, here.

916
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,120
- The fictive level?
- Yes, fictive level one.

917
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,880
Like I said,
this is an adaptation of Joan's life.

918
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,240
- You're in a show right now.
- I'm in a show right now?

919
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,120
Come on. Have you seen where you live?

920
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,920
Uh, who could afford a place like that?
It's a TV show house.

921
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,400
I mean, look at me.
Michael Cera licensed his face,

922
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,400
just like Annie Murphy licensed her face
to play Joan on level one,

923
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,360
and Salma Hayek licensed her face
to play Joan on level two

924
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,120
and to play herself here on level one.

925
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,560
[Hayek] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

926
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,440
I'm not playing myself.

927
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,720
I am myself.

928
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,440
Yeah, but it tracks that you believe that

929
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,920
because you're coded to play yourself
on this level.

930
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,440
- What?
- What?

931
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,200
We're not in reality right now.
This is fictive level one.

932
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,920
[Hayek] If I'm not here, then where am I?

933
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,280
I don't know where the real Miss Hayek is.
I don't have eyes on her.

934
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,760
She's probably in Zurich
or on a beach somewhere.

935
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,440
- I don't know where she is.
- Zurich?

936
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,360
This is not called

937
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,800
<i>Salma Hayek Gets Everything Explained
To Her But Doesn't Understand It Still.</i>

938
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,120
- It's called <i>Joan Is Awful. </i>Her story.
- What the fuck?

939
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,560
By which I mean the real her.

940
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,520
Not Annie Murphy, Source Joan.
The Joan that lives...

941
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,280
Oh, thank God!

942
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,120
He was so boring.

943
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,800
Jesus!

944
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,840
[exhales] Annie Murphy, you're my hero.

945
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,440
You guard the door.

946
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,320
I'm gonna kill that fucking computer.

947
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,920
[tense music playing]

948
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,520
- She wasn't in the schedule.
- I know that. I was working...

949
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,800
S3? Check S3.

950
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,760
Come on! Come on!
Just kill that quam-<i>puta!</i>

951
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,560
Okay, just wait a second. Wait a second.

952
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:36,920
So, inside this computer,
there's a version of you playing me

953
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,120
who thinks she's real?

954
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,600
- Yeah.
- [door opens]

955
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,640
- They're coming! Do it! Do it!
- [Mona] Stop!

956
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,680
If you destroy that, you destroy everybody
inside every fictive universe above this.

957
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,880
- You!
- Billions of simulated souls

958
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,160
who consider themselves to be real
will die.

959
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,280
Do you really want all that blood
on your hands?

960
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,640
I mean, define "blood" for me here.

961
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,960
Okay, this is a quantum computer, right?
We barely know how it works.

962
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,360
It's basically magic.

963
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,680
The reality we're in will cease to exist.

964
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,720
Would I die?

965
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,040
Instantly.

966
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,720
Put the fucking axe down,
Annie Murphy, now.

967
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,856
- [Mona] Listen to her. Do as you're told.
- [Hayek] Put it down!

968
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,880
I can't.

969
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,960
Because the fact
that I'm standing here right now

970
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,640
means that Source Joan
already stood here in reality.

971
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,480
- It doesn't matter what I want...
- Get in.

972
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,840
...because the events that this is based on
have already happened.

973
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,440
It's not my decision.

974
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,080
- It's Joan's.
- [Mona] Okay.

975
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,120
- It's happening.
- All right, Joan.

976
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,960
- She's doing it. Joan's doing it.
- [Mona] Joan, put the axe down.

977
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,680
No! The quamputer!

978
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,160
Joan! Fucking Jesus!

979
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,320
[screams]

980
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,560
[tense music playing]

981
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,760
[panting]

982
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,840
[alarm sounding]

983
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,840
I think we're done. [laughing]

984
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,880
[gentle music playing]

985
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,320
- [officer] What's your name, please?
- Annie Murphy.

986
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,560
[officer] Miss Murphy, what do you...

987
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,680
[therapist] <i>So, where are we at?</i>

988
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,040
- Uh, I'm dating again.
- Mm-hmm.

989
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,680
Just taking it slow, you know.

990
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,920
And trying to make some time for myself.

991
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,320
Well, how does that make you feel?

992
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,440
It feels good, you know?

993
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,880
It feels good to be okay on your own.

994
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,120
[therapist] <i>And work?</i>

995
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,960
Yeah. I mean,
my job is far less corporate.

996
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,080
But I'm my own boss.

997
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,520
I... I treat my staff well.

998
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,200
Uh, and I'm actually...

999
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,840
I'm actually proud of what I do. So...

1000
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,400
- [therapist] <i>It's good to hear.
- Yeah, thanks.</i>

1001
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,120
So, maybe now, do you feel...

1002
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,880
Yeah, uh, like the main character
in my own life?

1003
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,960
[therapist] Mm-hmm.

1004
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,680
Yeah, I... I think I do.

1005
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,400
[therapist] <i>And you don't feel
too confined?</i>

1006
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,400
- Oh, the house arrest?
- Mm-hmm.

1007
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,040
You know, there's good days and bad days.

1008
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,960
I guess that's to be expected.

1009
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,480
[uplifting music playing]

1010
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,360
You're supposed to encourage me.

1011
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,680
- What is that?
- Yeah, it's not good. I know.

1012
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,160
[Annie] Hi, Joan.

1013
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,280
Hi, Annie!

1014
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,536
- How you doing?
- [Joan] Good.

1015
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,240
- The usual?
- The usual, please.

1016
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,320
Okay.

1017
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,520
- [Annie] Missed you.
- [Joan] I missed you. How are you?

1018
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,560
[Annie] I'm good.

1019
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,920
[uplifting music continues]

1020
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,400
[air horn blaring]

1021
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,840
Merry Christmas, one and all!

1022
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:25,920
[guests murmuring]

1023
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,520

[groans]

1025
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,520
Yeah, yeah.

1026
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,720
[guests groaning in disgust]

1027
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,360
Sorry. I know. I know.

1028
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,040
Get out! Get out!

1029
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,120
[guests screaming]

1030
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,960
Yeah. I'm sorry.
