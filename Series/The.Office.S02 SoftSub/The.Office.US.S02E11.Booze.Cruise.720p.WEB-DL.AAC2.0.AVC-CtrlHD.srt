1
00:00:02,852 --> 00:00:04,683
Hey.
Hello.

2
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:06,947
Jim!

3
00:00:07,024 --> 00:00:09,549
What's up, buddy? This is not
funny. Why is my stuff in here?

4
00:00:10,294 --> 00:00:13,161
That's weird. A dollar for a
stapler, that's pretty good.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,357
Yeah, well, I'm not paying
for my own stuff, okay?

6
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,162
I know you did this, 'cause you're
friends with the vending machine guy.

7
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:20,169
Who, Steve?
Yeah, Steve.

8
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:22,171
Whatever his name is. What
do I want? What do I want?

9
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:25,635
It's a pencil cup.

10
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:30,570
Oh, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.
I don't think so, I just bought it.

11
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:33,942
I think so, and you're gonna
hand it over to me.

12
00:00:34,018 --> 00:00:35,349
I love these.

13
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:37,543
Okay, fine.

14
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:40,680
Where's my wallet?

15
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:43,484
There it is. J1.

16
00:00:45,062 --> 00:00:46,393
Here, you know what?
I don't have any...

17
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,055
I've got some nickels.

18
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:53,634
$0.05, $0.10,

19
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,608
$0.15, $0.20, $0.25...

20
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:34,703
Hello, everyone.
Good morning, Michael.

21
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:36,643
Where are we going
this afternoon?

22
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:43,043
Last week, Michael sent out
this mysterious memo.

23
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,350
"It's time for our
first-quarter camaraderie event.

24
00:01:45,422 --> 00:01:50,121
"So pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush,
rubber-soled shoes and a ski mask. "

25
00:01:50,594 --> 00:01:52,960
A ski mask and a swimsuit.

26
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:57,997
So that he can have us rob a bank
and then escape through the sewers.

27
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:00,532
And brush our teeth.

28
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,800
Yeah.

29
00:02:03,507 --> 00:02:05,771
Michael.
Stanley, bo-banley.

30
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:08,044
I need to know...
Banana-fana-fo-fanley.

31
00:02:08,112 --> 00:02:09,636
...what we're doing.
Me, my, mo, manly.

32
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,681
You said bring a toothbrush.
Stanley.

33
00:02:11,749 --> 00:02:14,718
Is this an overnight?
Maybe.

34
00:02:14,918 --> 00:02:17,978
The suspense is just
so exciting, isn't it?

35
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,489
Should my wife tell her boss
she's not coming in tomorrow?

36
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,151
Maybe. I don't know.
Not maybe. Yes or no?

37
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,162
Well, no, but... Okay, don't
spoil it for everybody, all right?

38
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:34,203
But we are going on a booze
cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.

39
00:02:35,873 --> 00:02:37,363
In January?

40
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:39,739
It's cheaper.

41
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,500
This is not just
another party.

42
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,411
This is a leadership
training exercise.

43
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:46,173
Right?

44
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,186
I'm going to combine elements of
fun and motivation and education

45
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:53,655
into a single
mind-blowing experience.

46
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,759
It is now time to unveil

47
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:58,386
the destination
of this year's retreat.

48
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:03,958
We are going on a harbor
cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack.

49
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:05,826
Yes!

50
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,902
It's a booze cruise.
All right!

51
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:16,235
I have a test for business
school tomorrow night.

52
00:03:16,313 --> 00:03:19,305
Is it okay if I skip the
cruise and study for that?

53
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:21,248
No, this is mandatory.

54
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:23,809
But don't worry. You know
what? You're gonna learn plenty.

55
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:26,617
This is gonna
turn your life around, Ryan.

56
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,523
I'm already in business
school. Well, this...

57
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:31,026
Wait, Michael.
Yeah?

58
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:34,655
Why did you tell us to bring a bathing
suit? To throw you off the scent.

59
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:35,993
Yeah, but I bought
a bathing suit.

60
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:38,694
Well, just keep the tags on
and you can return it.

61
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:41,932
I took the tags off already. Well,
that's not my fault, okay? Just...

62
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:44,166
We're not gonna pay
for a bathing suit.

63
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:48,109
Okay, I know what you're all thinking.
"Who is this smart little cookie?"

64
00:03:48,178 --> 00:03:52,274
Her name is Brenda something,
and she is from Corporate.

65
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:55,182
And she is here, like you, to
learn from what I have to say.

66
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:57,117
I am a great
motivational speaker.

67
00:03:57,187 --> 00:04:01,749
I attended a Tony Robbins event
by the airport last year and...

68
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,988
It wasn't the actual course. You
have to pay for the actual course.

69
00:04:06,597 --> 00:04:10,033
But it talked about
the actual course.

70
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:15,598
And I've incorporated a lot of
his ideas into my own course.

71
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,633
Leader... ship.

72
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,338
The word "ship" is hidden
inside the word "leadership"

73
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:26,879
as its derivation.

74
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:31,444
So if this office
is in fact a ship,

75
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:33,613
as its leader,

76
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:36,023
I am the captain.

77
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:40,526
But we're all
in the same boat. Teamwork!

78
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:44,957
Last year, Michael's theme was
"Bowl over the competition. "

79
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:47,135
So guess where we went.

80
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,667
Now, on this ship
that is the office,

81
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:54,601
what is the sales department?

82
00:04:55,646 --> 00:04:56,840
Anyone?

83
00:04:57,114 --> 00:04:59,981
How about the sales department
is the sails?

84
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,383
Yes, Darryl, the sales
department makes sales. Good.

85
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:08,419
Let me just explain. I see the
sales department as the furnace.

86
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:11,794
A furnace?
How old is this ship?

87
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:15,064
How about the anchor?
What does the furnace do?

88
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:18,226
All right, let's not get hung
up on the furnace. It's just...

89
00:05:18,302 --> 00:05:20,793
It's the sales... I see the
sales department are down there.

90
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:23,931
They're in the engine room, and
they're shoveling coal into the furnace.

91
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:25,031
Right?

92
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:26,370
I mean, who saw
the movie Titanic?

93
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:28,274
They were very important
in the movie Titanic.

94
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:30,040
Who saw it? Show of hands.

95
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:32,010
Not really sure what movie
you're talking about.

96
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,346
Are you sure you got
the title right? Titanic.

97
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,409
I think you're thinking of
The Hunt for Red October.

98
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:39,046
No! I'm... Leo DiCaprio!
Come on!

99
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:40,749
Michael stands
in the front of the boat

100
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:43,725
and says that he's king of the
world within the first hour,

101
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:45,523
or I give you
my next paycheck.

102
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:48,328
Michael, everyone
in the engine room drowned.

103
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:51,390
No. Thank you, spoiler alert.

104
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:54,995
You saw the movie,
those of you who did. You...

105
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,331
They're happy down there
in the furnace room.

106
00:05:57,407 --> 00:06:00,205
And they're dirty
and grimy and sweaty.

107
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,508
And they're singing
their ethnic songs and...

108
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:06,515
Actually,
that might be warehouse.

109
00:06:06,683 --> 00:06:08,207
What?
The...

110
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,810
No, no... No, I didn't...

111
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:16,120
Okay. Well, the... Okay, in a nutshell,
what I'm saying is "leadership. "

112
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:18,821
We'll talk more about that
on the boat. Ship.

113
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:20,725
Aye-aye, Captain.

114
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:25,168
A three hour tour

115
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:26,998
Pam,
you are Mary Ann.

116
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,664
We have the Professor
and Ginger.

117
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,173
Welcome aboard!

118
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:34,005
Angela, you are
Mrs. Howell, Lovey.

119
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,113
The native. Sometimes they
come from neighboring...

120
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,047
We have
one of the Globetrotters.

121
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:43,416
I am the Skipper, and, Dwight,
you will be Gilligan!

122
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:44,545
Cool!

123
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:46,486
Actually, I'm the skipper.
Okay.

124
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:48,319
But you could be Gilligan.
No! I'd rather die.

125
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:51,953
Hi. I am Michael Scott. I
am the captain of this party.

126
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:54,290
I'm Captain Jack.
I'm captain of the ship.

127
00:06:54,364 --> 00:06:56,423
I'm also captain of anyone
who sets foot on this ship.

128
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,401
Hi, welcome aboard.
Okay.

129
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,801
In an office,
when you are ranking people,

130
00:07:01,872 --> 00:07:04,340
manager is higher
than captain.

131
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:07,840
On a boat, who knows?
It's nebulous.

132
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:12,242
Hey, look!
I'm king of the world!

133
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:23,538
Okay, all right!

134
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:24,771
Welcome aboard!

135
00:07:24,846 --> 00:07:26,746
I am your captain,
Captain Jack.

136
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:31,308
And I am the Regional Manager
of Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott.

137
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:32,443
Welcome, welcome!

138
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,317
Okay, so...
Okay, so...

139
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:36,982
Please. The life preservers...
Right.

140
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:40,050
...they are located underneath the seats
all along the perimeter of the boat.

141
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:42,289
Don't worry, you are not gonna be
needing life preservers tonight.

142
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:43,853
Well, we might be.
It's just gonna be...

143
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,422
Please let me finish.
Okay? Thank you. Well...

144
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:49,837
So the Coast Guard requires that I
tell you where the safety exits are.

145
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:52,702
Now, on this ship, it's very
easy. Anywhere over the side.

146
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:58,044
Not only am I your ship's captain,
I am also your party captain!

147
00:07:58,112 --> 00:08:00,012
We're gonna get it going here
in just a few minutes.

148
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,878
And I'm
your party captain, too!

149
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,747
And you are gonna put on
your dancing shoes later on!

150
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,810
Hey, Mike, Mike, Mike.
So we are gonna...

151
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:08,583
If you don't mind...
... rock it!

152
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,715
What?
Please! Okay?

153
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,586
If the boat's rocking,
don't come knocking!

154
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,958
Michael.
Yeah?

155
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:17,725
Your company employees are not the
only people on the boat tonight. Okay?

156
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:21,064
We're all gonna have a good time
tonight. Hey, listen, listen, Mike.

157
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:23,126
Why don't you let me
and my crew do our job?

158
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:26,071
You just sit back and have
a good time. Okay. Yep. So...

159
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,437
All right?

160
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:30,973
You guys, it's like we're in high
school and we're at the cool table.

161
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:33,579
Right?
Yeah.

162
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,147
Pam, were you a cheerleader?

163
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:38,617
No, she was total "Miss
Artsy-Fartsy" in high school.

164
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,285
She wore the turtleneck and
everything. That's hilarious.

165
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,619
It's not hilarious...

166
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:45,852
Where did you go to school?

167
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:48,452
Bishop O'Hare.
His-slop-who-cares-a...?

168
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,391
We played you!

169
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:53,232
You really look familiar.
Did you...

170
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:55,394
You cheered for them,
didn't you?

171
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:58,336
No.
Yes, I did.

172
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,271
A- W-E-S-O-M-E

173
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,039
Awesome, awesome is what we are
We're the football superstars!

174
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:07,546
A- W-E-S-O-M-E

175
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:10,311
I remember that, and we
crushed you, like, 42-10.

176
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,147
Having fun?
Yeah.

177
00:09:12,854 --> 00:09:14,481
Everybody's really nice.

178
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:18,116
Good, well, that is what
Scranton is all about.

179
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:20,917
Not like you New Yorkers!
So...

180
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:22,860
When are you gonna
start the presentation?

181
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,795
I already sort of started it
back at the office

182
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:27,232
and on the dock
with the Gilligan thing.

183
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,701
So, right now, I was thinking.

184
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,328
Yes, okay!

185
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,568
Listen up,
all you Dunder Mifflinites!

186
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:39,011
I would like to talk to you
all about life preservers.

187
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:44,207
Now, one important life preserver
in business is IT support.

188
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,179
Not now, Mike,
we're doing the limbo!

189
00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:51,317
That's right, partiers, it's
time to limbo, limbo, limbo!

190
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:52,450
So, okay.

191
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:55,927
All right, I need a volunteer to
come up here and hold my stick!

192
00:09:55,997 --> 00:09:58,761
Who's it gonna be? Okay.
Me, me, me.

193
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,528
Usually it's a woman.
I'm stronger.

194
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,231
Hey, I got an idea.

195
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:07,866
How would you like
to steer the ship, Dwight?

196
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:11,875
Keep us on a steady course. Keep a
sharp eye out. I'm counting on you.

197
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:15,973
I was the youngest pilot in
Pan Am history. When I was four,

198
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,577
the pilot let me ride in the
cockpit and fly the plane with him.

199
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,312
And I was four
and I was great.

200
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:26,588
And I would have landed it, but my
dad wanted us to go back to our seats.

201
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:32,161
All right, all right,
that was great!

202
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,701
Now it's time
for the dance contest!

203
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:37,533
Why don't we do that
after I do my presentation?

204
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:39,766
Nope. Dance contest!

205
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,900
All right, we'll have
a motivational dance contest!

206
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:44,171
Hit it!

207
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:47,543
Yeah! Okay! Dancing!

208
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:50,578
It is a primal art form

209
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,115
used in ancient times

210
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:55,755
to express yourself
with the body!

211
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,382
And communicate!

212
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:12,102
Sometimes you have to
take a break

213
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:16,200
from being the kind of boss that's
always trying to teach people things.

214
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:19,504
Sometimes you have to just
be the boss dancing.

215
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:36,527
What do you do
with a drunken sailor?

216
00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:40,092
What do you do
with a drunken sailor

217
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,193
Early in the morning?

218
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,768
Come inside and talk to me.
I can't.

219
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:51,576
Do you want us
to run aground, woman?

220
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,249
Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot!

221
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,646
Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot!
Snorkel shot!

222
00:12:01,122 --> 00:12:02,316
Yeah!

223
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:04,388
Who's next? Come on!

224
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,585
Pammy, come on! Come on!
No, I'm not doing that.

225
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,991
Come on!

226
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,234
Hey, why don't we find, like,
a quieter place to hang out?

227
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:18,066
No, I just gotta wait for Darryl
to do his shot. Just a minute.

228
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:20,300
Come on. Darryl! Darryl!

229
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:23,133
It's getting kind of
rowdy down there. Yeah.

230
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,872
"Darryl, Darryl, Darryl!"

231
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,912
Sometimes I just
don't get Roy.

232
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,518
I mean, I don't know.

233
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:48,495
So...

234
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,038
What's it like
dating a cheerleader?

235
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,696
I'm cold.

236
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:33,008
So, what's this presentation
all about?

237
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,742
See? This is
of general interest.

238
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,641
It is about priorities

239
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:42,253
and making decisions,
using the boat as an analogy.

240
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:43,756
What is important to you?

241
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:46,520
If the boat is sinking,
what do you save?

242
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,619
Women and children. No, no,
salesmen and profit centers.

243
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:53,960
That's a stupid analogy.
Okay.

244
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:57,663
Well, obviously you don't know
anything about leadership.

245
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:01,308
Well, I was the captain of a
PC-1 Cyclone coastal patrol boat

246
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,706
during Desert Storm.

247
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:05,870
Wow, you should be
the motivational speaker.

248
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,570
Him? Okay.

249
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:10,208
Yeah, he gives me
real responsibility, Michael.

250
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,841
Captain Jack delegates.

251
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,683
He's let me steer the ship
for the last hour.

252
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,921
I'd like to be engaged.

253
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:20,487
How did you manage
to pull that off?

254
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:26,697
I've been engaged for three
years, and there's no end in sight.

255
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,228
So you don't want
to ask my advice.

256
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,770
Suppose your office building's
on fire,

257
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,807
Jim, who would you save?

258
00:14:35,843 --> 00:14:37,140
Let's see...

259
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:42,672
The customer,
because the customer is king.

260
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,581
Not what I was looking for,
but a good thought.

261
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:46,347
He's just sucking up.

262
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:50,681
When you were in the Navy,
did you ever almost die?

263
00:14:50,758 --> 00:14:53,750
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, and I wasn't
thinking about some customer.

264
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:55,988
I was thinking about
my first wife.

265
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:58,757
The day I got back on shore,
I married her.

266
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,795
You know what?
I would save the receptionist.

267
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:07,966
I just wanted
to clear that up.

268
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:12,868
Everybody,

269
00:15:12,947 --> 00:15:15,313
could I get your attention
for just a second?

270
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,940
Can you listen to me
for a second?

271
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:20,851
We were up at the front, and we were
talking about what's really important and...

272
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:22,655
Pam,

273
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:25,118
I think enough is enough.

274
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,126
I think we should set a date
for our wedding.

275
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:30,129
How about June 10th?
Come on, let's do it!

276
00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:32,293
Come on, baby!

277
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:34,163
Yeah!
Congratulations!

278
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,368
Congratulations!

279
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:38,670
Yeah! Yeah!

280
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,466
Oh, my God!
I love you, baby!

281
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:43,041
Congratulations!

282
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,190
You know what, I don't want
to take credit for this,

283
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:52,767
but Roy and I were just
having a conversation

284
00:15:52,837 --> 00:15:55,271
about making commitments

285
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,808
and making choices. Right?

286
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,708
Did I motivate you?
No, it's Captain Jack.

287
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:02,804
Well...
Captain Jack.

288
00:16:03,481 --> 00:16:04,948
Could have been
either one of us,

289
00:16:05,016 --> 00:16:06,916
because we pretty much
were saying the same thing.

290
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:08,748
Congratulations!
That is great!

291
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,084
We gotta celebrate!
Yeah!

292
00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:15,817
Hey, hey, hey!
I got an idea, I got an idea.

293
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:18,361
I could marry you right now
as captain of the ship.

294
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:19,521
Yes!

295
00:16:19,597 --> 00:16:22,532
I could marry you as Regional
Manager of Dunder Mifflin!

296
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:25,159
No, no, no. I want my
mom and dad to be there.

297
00:16:25,236 --> 00:16:26,999
Then I'll give you away!

298
00:16:27,438 --> 00:16:28,803
No, thank you.

299
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,173
Do you think that'll ever be us? No.

300
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:43,776
What is wrong with you? Why did
you even bring me here tonight?

301
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,252
I don't know.

302
00:16:45,757 --> 00:16:48,920
Let's break up.
What?

303
00:16:50,128 --> 00:16:52,653
This is where old Captain Jack
drives the boat.

304
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,890
Wow!

305
00:16:55,366 --> 00:16:56,731
Seasick?

306
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:58,632
Captain Jack says
you should look at the moon.

307
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,501
Captain Jack's a fart-face.

308
00:17:04,976 --> 00:17:07,809
I'm on medication.
Really? What?

309
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,410
Vomacillin.

310
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:15,450
Okay, all right.
It's time to be boss.

311
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,720
Time to motivate.
Let's blow some minds here.

312
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:19,848
Okay, guys, guys, guys.
Cool it.

313
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:22,256
Everybody? Dunder Mifflin
Scranton employees,

314
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:26,786
Brenda, I've some very, very urgent
news I need to tell everybody.

315
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:28,365
Right now. Listen up.

316
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:30,731
The ship is sinking.

317
00:17:31,502 --> 00:17:32,628
Okay?

318
00:17:32,704 --> 00:17:34,638
We're going down right now.

319
00:17:34,706 --> 00:17:37,504
Just wrap your heads
around the reality of that.

320
00:17:38,342 --> 00:17:40,401
Please! Everybody,
it's my turn now, okay?

321
00:17:40,478 --> 00:17:41,809
Captain Jack is gone.

322
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:45,940
In five minutes, this ship is going
to be at the bottom of the lake,

323
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,012
and there aren't enough spaces
on the lifeboat.

324
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:50,816
Who are we gonna save?

325
00:17:50,888 --> 00:17:52,879
Do we save sales?

326
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:56,960
Do we save customer service?
Do we save accounting?

327
00:17:57,095 --> 00:17:59,825
This is a business scenario.
Right?

328
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:03,094
It's a scary... It's a predicament.
Hey! What the hell is going on here?

329
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:07,394
And it's something that each and
every one of us have to think about.

330
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:09,470
I'm in the brig. See?

331
00:18:10,908 --> 00:18:13,775
The boat's not as
corporate-friendly as advertised.

332
00:18:14,846 --> 00:18:18,179
What is the deal with the guy
jumping overboard? What was...

333
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:21,741
If he had just waited
and heard what I had to say,

334
00:18:21,986 --> 00:18:24,955
he would be motivated
right now, and not all wet.

335
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:41,265
Is somebody there?

336
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:45,499
What happened to you?

337
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:49,706
Captain Jack has a problem
with authority.

338
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:53,373
Right, 'cause you announced
that his ship was sinking?

339
00:18:53,451 --> 00:18:56,477
Yeah. He just totally lost it.

340
00:18:56,888 --> 00:18:59,015
If you ask me,
he caused the panic.

341
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:05,328
What a night.

342
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,594
Well, it's nice for you.
Your friend got engaged.

343
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:12,363
She was always engaged. Roy
said the first one didn't count.

344
00:19:12,804 --> 00:19:14,863
That's great.

345
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:20,300
You know,
to tell you the truth,

346
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:23,946
I used to have a big thing
for Pam. So...

347
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:26,478
Really? You're kidding me.

348
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:31,553
You and Pam? Wow!

349
00:19:32,657 --> 00:19:37,026
I would have never put you two
together. You really hid it well. God!

350
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:40,890
I usually have a radar
for stuff like that.

351
00:19:43,968 --> 00:19:45,629
You know I made out with Jan.
Yeah, I know.

352
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:47,034
Yeah, yeah.

353
00:19:47,371 --> 00:19:50,033
Well, Pam is cute.
Yeah.

354
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:55,075
She's really funny,
and she's warm,

355
00:19:55,546 --> 00:19:57,446
and she's just...

356
00:19:58,382 --> 00:20:01,283
Anyway.
Well, if you like her so much,

357
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,844
don't give up.

358
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,687
She's engaged.
BFD. Engaged ain't married.

359
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:17,525
Never, ever, ever give up.

360
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:25,598
Don't worry, Michael.

361
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,775
I'm taking us to shore.

362
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:29,904
It's a fake wheel, dummy.
