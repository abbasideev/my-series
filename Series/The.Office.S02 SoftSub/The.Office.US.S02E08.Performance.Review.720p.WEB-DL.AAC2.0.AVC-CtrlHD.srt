1
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:14,363
You should get
one of these.

2
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,864
No, thank you.

3
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:18,192
Do you even know
what this is?

4
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:22,000
It is a fitness orb and it
has completely changed my life.

5
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:27,208
Forget everything you thought
you knew about ab workouts.

6
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:28,267
Done.

7
00:00:28,345 --> 00:00:32,475
This ab workout is specifically
designed to strengthen your core.

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,145
Sorry.
It's all right.

9
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:37,886
Numerous health benefits,

10
00:00:40,724 --> 00:00:42,214
strengthens your back,

11
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:44,352
better performance in sports,

12
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:46,792
more enjoyable sex.

13
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,864
You're not having sex.

14
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:54,003
Plus, improves
your reflexes.

15
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:56,066
See, I would have
caught that.

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,700
Okay, you know what,
how much is that?

17
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:00,175
It's only 25 bucks.

18
00:01:00,244 --> 00:01:01,336
Wow.

19
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:03,505
Okay.

20
00:01:45,107 --> 00:01:47,439
Pam, can I see you
in my office?

21
00:01:48,677 --> 00:01:51,510
It's performance
review day, company-wide.

22
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:54,680
Last year, my performance
review started

23
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,242
with Michael asking me
what my hopes and dreams were

24
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,689
and it ended with him telling me
he could bench press 190 pounds.

25
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,991
So, I don't really know
what to expect.

26
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:08,129
Pam, you're trustworthy.
Thank you.

27
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:09,493
And a woman.
Oh, no.

28
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:13,193
And I want you to listen
to a voicemail from my boss.

29
00:02:14,536 --> 00:02:17,232
Michael, it's Jan.
I guess I missed you.

30
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:20,742
I'll be there this afternoon
for performance reviews.

31
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:24,606
I hope it's understood that that
will be our only topic of discussion.

32
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,806
See you soon.

33
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:27,576
First impressions?

34
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:31,046
Just off the top,

35
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:33,781
I think she'll be here
this afternoon.

36
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:35,288
My boss is
coming in today.

37
00:02:35,357 --> 00:02:37,052
The lovely Jan Levinson-Gould.

38
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,889
Well, no Gould,
the Gould has been...

39
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:41,223
Divorce.

40
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:47,030
The awkward part is that this is the first
time we'll be seeing each other since...

41
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:49,431
Well...

42
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:51,503
It was
really nothing.

43
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:54,235
We just sort of
got caught up in the moment.

44
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:56,243
The vulnerable divorcee

45
00:02:56,778 --> 00:03:01,272
gives herself to the "understanding
with rugged good looks" office manager.

46
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,377
Just, she didn't want it
to continue for some reason.

47
00:03:06,655 --> 00:03:08,418
We both didn't.
I didn't want it.

48
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,221
We both didn't want it to
continue. It was not professional.

49
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:16,628
When people say something's
mutual, it never is.

50
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:18,529
But this was mutual.

51
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:21,362
I guess I missed you.

52
00:03:21,436 --> 00:03:23,666
"I guess I missed you. "

53
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:26,034
So she misses me?

54
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:27,899
She missed you.

55
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:33,777
But then she goes on to say, "That
will be our only topic of discussion. "

56
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:36,215
That doesn't mean anything.
Those are just words.

57
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:37,683
I have one idea
of what it means.

58
00:03:37,753 --> 00:03:39,084
Okay, yeah. What? What?

59
00:03:39,154 --> 00:03:41,452
Well, I don't think you're
gonna be very happy with this.

60
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:43,150
Oh, great.

61
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:47,061
All right, well,
now I'm in a terrible mood.

62
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,729
Let's do your
performance review.

63
00:03:49,798 --> 00:03:51,789
Because she's conflicted.

64
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:56,027
She has to be professional, but
she's fighting feelings for you.

65
00:03:57,806 --> 00:04:00,206
Why... That's great news.
That...

66
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:02,668
Why would I not like that?

67
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:06,703
Just 'cause that you work
together and it might be awkward.

68
00:04:06,782 --> 00:04:08,181
Wow, wow.

69
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,675
All right, let's listen
to that again.

70
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,519
Michael, it's Jan.
I guess I missed you.

71
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:15,788
Oh, hey.

72
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:17,924
Listen, Jim,

73
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,194
here's a little tip
for your performance review.

74
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:22,389
Okay.
Tell Michael that

75
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:26,556
we should be stocking more of the
double-tabbed manila file folders.

76
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:28,159
We don't have double-tabbed
manila file folders.

77
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:29,294
Oh, yes, we do.
No, we don't.

78
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:31,896
Yeah, it's a new product. So, you
should just suggest that to him

79
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:33,804
and then he'll be sure
to give you a raise.

80
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,206
All right.

81
00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:37,409
Well, I'm not asking
for a raise.

82
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,414
I'm gonna actually be asking
for a pay decrease.

83
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:43,918
That is so stupid.
What if he gives it to you?

84
00:04:45,153 --> 00:04:46,279
Then I win.

85
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:49,551
You know what? I am going to zone
you out for the rest of today.

86
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:51,421
Okay. I need to stay focused.

87
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:53,586
And I don't have to
see you tomorrow or Sunday,

88
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:57,428
and please don't call me, and
we'll see how things go Monday.

89
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,928
Stupid.

90
00:05:01,203 --> 00:05:02,568
Wait, wait, one thing.

91
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:06,200
By tomorrow,
you mean Saturday, right?

92
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:08,274
Duh!
Duh.

93
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:12,079
Today is Thursday, but Dwight
thinks that it's Friday.

94
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:15,812
And that's what I'll be
working on this afternoon.

95
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:19,643
Sometimes women say more in their
pauses than they say in their words.

96
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:21,586
Really?
Oh, yes.

97
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:26,093
Let's listen to it again, and this
time, really listen to the pauses.

98
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:29,321
God, Stanley. That's freaking
brilliant. How do you know that?

99
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:31,297
Did you learn that
on the streets?

100
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:35,166
I'm sorry. Oh, it's okay. I
did learn it on the streets.

101
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:37,137
On the ghetto, in fact.

102
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:38,938
No kidding.

103
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:41,609
It's all about
my bonus.

104
00:05:43,645 --> 00:05:45,237
Michael and Jan
definitely made out.

105
00:05:45,313 --> 00:05:47,213
Oh!
Maybe more.

106
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:51,110
Oh, also it is Thursday,
but Dwight thinks it's Friday.

107
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:52,676
So, keep that going.

108
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:54,085
Oh, yay!

109
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,928
Good work, Stanley.
Great performance review!

110
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:02,657
Stanley in the house,
everybody!

111
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:05,560
Angela, your turn.

112
00:06:05,634 --> 00:06:08,194
I actually look forward
to performance reviews.

113
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,604
I did the youth beauty pageant
circuit and I enjoyed that quite a bit.

114
00:06:13,175 --> 00:06:15,336
I really enjoy being judged.

115
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:20,175
I believe I hold up very well
to even severe scrutiny.

116
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:21,545
Michael?
Yeah?

117
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:23,083
Jan's on the phone for you.

118
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:27,315
Angela, you were totally
satisfactory this year.

119
00:06:28,323 --> 00:06:32,453
Interesting. Jan is calling me.
Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all.

120
00:06:33,094 --> 00:06:34,220
Yeah?

121
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:35,761
Michael...
Jan!

122
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,991
Hello. To what do I owe this pleasure?

123
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,860
I'm returning your many calls.
Well, hello to you, too.

124
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:44,371
Yeah, I was just...

125
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:46,765
I just wanted to
get some closure

126
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:50,368
on what transpired
between us at the meeting

127
00:06:50,445 --> 00:06:53,243
we had in the parking lot
of the Chili's.

128
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,476
No.

129
00:06:56,685 --> 00:06:58,915
No, we won't be
discussing that, Michael.

130
00:06:58,987 --> 00:07:01,751
The only things I wanna talk about
during your performance review

131
00:07:01,823 --> 00:07:04,883
are your concrete ideas
to improve your branch.

132
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,260
Well, surely,
this review is a formality

133
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:14,166
because of what happened at our meeting
in the parking lot of the Chili's.

134
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:17,296
The review is anything
but a formality, Michael.

135
00:07:17,372 --> 00:07:19,670
And I expect you
to forget anything

136
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:22,574
that you think may have
happened between us

137
00:07:22,644 --> 00:07:25,545
and exhibit completely
professional behavior.

138
00:07:25,614 --> 00:07:26,706
Been thinking about you.

139
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:30,649
Okay, that is an example of
completely unprofessional behavior.

140
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:32,983
I don't see how
that's unprofessional.

141
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:34,316
Michael?
Yeah?

142
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,653
Are the cameras in there
with you, in your office?

143
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:38,386
No. They are not.

144
00:07:40,762 --> 00:07:42,229
Yes, they are.

145
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:46,498
That's my girlfriend.

146
00:07:47,502 --> 00:07:50,335
I heard they made out
and had sex.

147
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:52,805
I heard they just
made out. That's it.

148
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:58,972
Well, I heard they made out
and had sex.

149
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:00,878
Don't talk about it.

150
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:05,485
Office romances are nobody's
business but the people involved.

151
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:09,487
Romances?

152
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,126
Pam, I have ideas
on a daily basis, I know I do.

153
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:17,762
I have a clear memory
of telling people my ideas.

154
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:22,668
Is there any chance that you wrote
any of my ideas down in a folder,

155
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:24,102
like an idea folder?

156
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:25,161
Sorry.

157
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,264
That's unfortunate.

158
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:31,239
How about the suggestion box?
There's tons of ideas in there.

159
00:08:31,313 --> 00:08:32,371
What suggestion box?

160
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:34,472
The suggestion box
that I put out.

161
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:37,109
And people could put in
suggestions anonymously.

162
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:38,618
Maybe there's prizes.

163
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:42,088
Oh, yeah, I think I remember that
from back when I first started.

164
00:08:42,157 --> 00:08:45,126
Why don't you find it and then
tell people to get their...

165
00:08:45,193 --> 00:08:46,387
No, never mind.
I'll tell them.

166
00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:49,589
Hello? Everybody?
Yeah, attention, please.

167
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:51,859
Jan Levinson's
coming very soon

168
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:55,835
and so we're gonna have our
weekly suggestion box meeting.

169
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:59,635
So you can all get in your
constructive compliments ASAP.

170
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:01,500
Don't you mean
constructive criticism?

171
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:02,600
What did I say?

172
00:09:02,677 --> 00:09:05,043
You said constructive compliments.
That doesn't make any sense.

173
00:09:05,113 --> 00:09:07,604
Well, Kelly, that was neither
constructive nor a compliment,

174
00:09:07,682 --> 00:09:10,583
so maybe you should
stop criticizing my English

175
00:09:10,652 --> 00:09:13,621
and start making some
suggestions, okay?

176
00:09:13,955 --> 00:09:17,152
Hey, Dan, this is Jim.
It is about 11:15

177
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:19,455
and I wanted to know
what you were up to tomorrow,

178
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:23,327
which is the 15th,
and that is a...

179
00:09:23,398 --> 00:09:25,093
Saturday.
Saturday.

180
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,895
So just let me know
what you're doing tomorrow,

181
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:28,299
Saturday, for lunch.

182
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,270
Okay, talk to you soon.

183
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:35,538
Address this
when we meet again.

184
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,335
Okay. Okay, bye-bye.

185
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:40,779
Would you please tell
Michael that I'm here?

186
00:09:40,849 --> 00:09:41,907
Sure.

187
00:09:41,983 --> 00:09:44,543
Hi, Jan. How are you? Hi,
Michael. I'm good. How are you?

188
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:45,608
Good to see you.

189
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:47,587
Nice to see you.
Okay.

190
00:09:48,123 --> 00:09:50,751
Okay, why don't we just
step into my office?

191
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,593
We're gonna go in here. Could
we please go into your office?

192
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,595
Yeah, right after you.

193
00:09:55,697 --> 00:09:56,686
Apres vous.

194
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:57,754
No calls.

195
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:06,917
I'll get that.
Oh, thank you.

196
00:10:06,993 --> 00:10:09,461
It's nice to see you. Nice
to see you, too, Michael.

197
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:12,054
Really?
Not like that.

198
00:10:12,131 --> 00:10:13,120
Oh, well...

199
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,228
You know, Michael, I think I need to
make something clear right off the top.

200
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:21,103
I'm not going to discuss anything with
you other than Dunder Mifflin business.

201
00:10:21,174 --> 00:10:22,801
All right.
Period.

202
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,173
Do we understand each other? Absolutely.

203
00:10:25,244 --> 00:10:27,906
I'm a little confused because
first it's, like, all kissy-kissy

204
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,074
and then it's, like, all regret
because, "Oh, I regret that.

205
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,880
"But, wait, I'm still
gonna call you.

206
00:10:33,953 --> 00:10:36,615
"But we're just
gonna talk business,

207
00:10:36,689 --> 00:10:39,715
"and I may come down there and
fire you if you don't do your job. "

208
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:42,920
But what were we talking about
when we first kissed?

209
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:44,019
Business.

210
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:46,724
So, are you still in the middle
of the performance reviews then?

211
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,496
No, no, no. I finished all that.
I'm very fast. I'm not too fast.

212
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,198
Not like, "Wham, bam,
thank you, ma'am. "

213
00:10:53,306 --> 00:10:54,671
But I do say,
"Thank you, ma'am. "

214
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,402
But I'm not like,
"Wham bam. "

215
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,942
Not that there's anything wrong
with "wham bam," if it's consensual.

216
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:05,649
We're talking
about office stuff.

217
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,847
Can I ask you a question?
No.

218
00:11:09,922 --> 00:11:13,653
This is a business question.
It's nothing personal, I promise.

219
00:11:13,726 --> 00:11:14,886
Fine.

220
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:18,029
Are you wearing
a new perfume today?

221
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:20,762
How is that
a business question?

222
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,700
Well, you're wearing it
at the office, and...

223
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:27,464
It... I'm sorry, no offense,
but it's really sexy.

224
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,030
Please don't
smell me, Michael.

225
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:35,514
Hey, Jim.
Hey. How's it going?

226
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:37,515
Oh, my God, did you see
The Apprentice last night?

227
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,518
Of course. It's on every Thursday
night, so how could I miss it?

228
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:42,781
Can you believe who Trump
fired? No, that was unbelievable.

229
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:44,686
Who? Who was it?
Who did he fire?

230
00:11:44,757 --> 00:11:46,520
You didn't see it?
No.

231
00:11:46,592 --> 00:11:49,891
I went out and got drunk with my
laser tag team last night. Crap!

232
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:54,222
Never go out on a Thursday night.
What the hell was I thinking?

233
00:11:55,101 --> 00:11:56,295
I don't understand...

234
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,835
Hold on. Sorry.

235
00:11:59,272 --> 00:12:00,398
Yes, Pam.

236
00:12:00,473 --> 00:12:02,873
Michael, it's time for
the suggestion box meeting.

237
00:12:02,942 --> 00:12:05,934
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
I wish you wouldn't interrupt.

238
00:12:06,012 --> 00:12:07,070
You told me to buzz you

239
00:12:07,146 --> 00:12:09,239
about the suggestion box
meeting when Jan was here.

240
00:12:09,315 --> 00:12:11,579
I did not, not,
not use those words.

241
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:14,347
I'd like to sit in on that
meeting. Is it happening right now?

242
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,512
No, it's in, like,
10 minutes.

243
00:12:15,588 --> 00:12:17,715
Everyone's waiting
in the conference room.

244
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,451
Great. Very good.

245
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,732
Why are we here?
Because I value your opinions.

246
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:32,497
Now, I know a lot of you don't think
that I read your suggestions, but I do.

247
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:34,903
I just sift through them
every week

248
00:12:34,974 --> 00:12:39,468
and I really look and scrutinize
to see what you guys are writing.

249
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:43,713
So, let's just read
some of these suckers, okay?

250
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:45,580
All right. Number one.

251
00:12:45,651 --> 00:12:49,913
"What should we do
to prepare for Y2K?"

252
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:51,320
I thought you read these
every week?

253
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,790
Well, obviously, this
one got stuck in the box.

254
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:55,724
That happens occasionally.

255
00:12:55,795 --> 00:12:58,355
It happens occasionally. And, so...

256
00:12:58,798 --> 00:13:01,062
One down! Next suggestion.

257
00:13:02,234 --> 00:13:06,034
"We need better outreach for
employees fighting depression. "

258
00:13:06,105 --> 00:13:08,767
Okay. All right,
enough with the jokes.

259
00:13:08,841 --> 00:13:10,866
Nobody in here is suffering
from depression.

260
00:13:10,943 --> 00:13:12,843
That sounds serious,
Michael.

261
00:13:12,912 --> 00:13:15,244
Oh, okay. Well, yeah?
Who wrote it?

262
00:13:15,314 --> 00:13:16,474
Tom?
Tom.

263
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:18,983
Then, it is a joke because
there's nobody in here named Tom.

264
00:13:19,051 --> 00:13:22,543
Tom? He worked in accounting
up until about a year ago.

265
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,582
Tom.

266
00:13:28,227 --> 00:13:30,627
Oh, that guy?
That guy was weird.

267
00:13:30,696 --> 00:13:33,426
All right, next suggestion.
Next suggestion.

268
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:39,864
"You need to do
something about your B.O."

269
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:43,636
Okay. Now, I don't know who
this suggestion is meant for,

270
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:45,973
but it's more of
a personal suggestion.

271
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:47,774
And it's not an
office suggestion.

272
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:50,577
Far be it from me to use this as
a platform to embarrass anybody.

273
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:53,914
Aren't the suggestions
meant for you?

274
00:13:54,353 --> 00:13:57,117
Well, Toby, if by me

275
00:13:57,189 --> 00:14:00,386
you are inferring
that I have B.O.,

276
00:14:00,693 --> 00:14:04,322
then I would say that that is
a very poor choice of words.

277
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:08,064
Michael, he wasn't inferring, he
was implying. You were inferring.

278
00:14:08,134 --> 00:14:09,601
Was I, Creed?

279
00:14:09,668 --> 00:14:13,069
Okay, well, you know
what I am implying

280
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:17,473
is that when we're on an elevator
together, I should maybe take the stairs.

281
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:19,534
Because talk about stank.

282
00:14:19,845 --> 00:14:22,109
Not that I would ever say
something like that in public,

283
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:23,944
and I never have,
and I never will.

284
00:14:24,016 --> 00:14:28,009
I just think it's something that
we should all be aware of, okay?

285
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,289
Now that we've learned this,
let's continue.

286
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:32,381
See, this is good.

287
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,325
We're learning and we're
figuring some stuff out.

288
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:37,828
"You need to do something about
your coffee breath. " Okay, no!

289
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:40,365
"You need to do something... " Shut
up, shut up, shut up, Dwight. Okay.

290
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:44,893
I don't think you people are grasping
the concept of the suggestion box.

291
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,905
Sometimes you talk to
us real close. Yeah?

292
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,708
Is that hard for you?
All right. Well...

293
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:51,868
Well, when you have
coffee breath it's hard...

294
00:14:51,944 --> 00:14:52,933
I'll work on that.

295
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:54,309
Okay, let's keep going.

296
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,574
Just keep it going.

297
00:14:56,682 --> 00:15:01,676
Yup. What do we have here? We
have somebody's piece of gum.

298
00:15:02,188 --> 00:15:05,988
Somebody put a piece of gum in
there. This is not a garbage can.

299
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:10,017
This is the future of our company.
This is not a place for gum, okay?

300
00:15:10,095 --> 00:15:12,563
I don't want to have
to read these tomorrow.

301
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:14,929
Yeah. Who wants to
come in on a Saturday?

302
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,060
Yeah... What?
All right. Next suggestion.

303
00:15:18,137 --> 00:15:19,798
"Next suggestion. "

304
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,265
"Don't... " Okay, that's blank.
Don't... Just...

305
00:15:24,343 --> 00:15:27,073
Put it...
"Don't sleep with your boss. "

306
00:15:28,214 --> 00:15:31,411
Do you think this is
referring to you boning Jan?

307
00:15:32,384 --> 00:15:33,681
I can't... I don't understand
why you're so upset.

308
00:15:33,752 --> 00:15:34,776
I can't... All right,
please sit down.

309
00:15:34,854 --> 00:15:36,412
I'm going to sit over here,
you're gonna sit over there.

310
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:37,649
Why are you...
Let me ask you this.

311
00:15:37,723 --> 00:15:39,623
Please sit yourself down.
Let me ask you something.

312
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:42,126
What, Michael? Where
did you get your outfit?

313
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:49,261
You're gonna give me this
raise. I deserve this raise.

314
00:15:50,402 --> 00:15:53,098
Yes! Yes! Yes!

315
00:15:55,274 --> 00:15:58,675
The least you can do is keep my
salary consistent with inflation.

316
00:16:00,346 --> 00:16:03,110
Yes! Why are you gonna
give me this raise?

317
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:04,308
Why?

318
00:16:05,918 --> 00:16:08,580
Because I'm awesome!

319
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:10,747
I am awesome!

320
00:16:11,557 --> 00:16:15,891
I just don't understand why you have
to pretend like nothing happened.

321
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:18,191
Because nothing did, Michael.

322
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:23,234
I'm not gonna say anything more about it
and I would advise that you do the same.

323
00:16:23,302 --> 00:16:24,667
Look...
Michael.

324
00:16:24,737 --> 00:16:27,069
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I'm interrupting. Oh, God.

325
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:29,937
Were you guys making out?
No, Dwight. Come in.

326
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:31,499
Great.
What do you want, Dwight?

327
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:33,670
I am ready for my
performance review.

328
00:16:33,746 --> 00:16:34,906
Okay, great.

329
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,746
Your performance has been
adequate. You may leave. Goodbye.

330
00:16:39,985 --> 00:16:43,113
Is this how you've been conducting
all the reviews, Michael?

331
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:45,383
Do you want to talk now? Good.
Okay, Dwight, leave.

332
00:16:45,457 --> 00:16:47,687
Wait, I would like to
discuss my raise.

333
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,251
Why on earth would
we give you a raise?

334
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:53,628
That is an excellent question.
Thank you for asking it.

335
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:58,701
Let me bring up one word.
Dedication.

336
00:17:00,072 --> 00:17:02,632
I have never been late.

337
00:17:02,908 --> 00:17:07,038
Also, I have never
missed a day due to illness,

338
00:17:07,112 --> 00:17:09,546
even when I had
walking pneumonia.

339
00:17:09,615 --> 00:17:12,015
I even come in on holidays.

340
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:14,075
You do? How do you get in?

341
00:17:14,153 --> 00:17:15,780
I have a copy of your key.

342
00:17:15,854 --> 00:17:18,448
That's a serious offense.
That is a serious offense.

343
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:20,014
Very serious.

344
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:22,184
As is toying
with a man's heart.

345
00:17:22,261 --> 00:17:23,853
Oh, Michael, for God's sakes.

346
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:26,921
I'd also further like to talk
about my merits in the workplace.

347
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:29,626
Okay, third wheel, why don't
you do that? For instance,

348
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:31,761
the time I brought in deer
jerky for the whole office.

349
00:17:31,837 --> 00:17:35,000
That was deer? Gross.
Oh, God! You liked it.

350
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:36,939
Did not.
Jan, have you ever had deer?

351
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:38,476
No.
It's a delicacy.

352
00:17:38,544 --> 00:17:40,307
And, you know what?
It's an aphrodisiac.

353
00:17:40,379 --> 00:17:41,505
So when we're done here,

354
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,172
you guys could go over
to the Antler Lodge,

355
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:45,045
sample some deer,
and talk about my raise.

356
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:46,379
What do you say, Jan?

357
00:17:46,452 --> 00:17:48,010
Okay, here's what
I'm gonna do.

358
00:17:48,087 --> 00:17:49,918
I'm gonna step outside,
collect my thoughts,

359
00:17:49,989 --> 00:17:51,513
and I will return
in about 10 minutes.

360
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,957
Okay, you just clear your
head. Thank you, Dwight.

361
00:17:56,195 --> 00:17:58,220
Look, I know it's your job,
I know you have to ask,

362
00:17:58,297 --> 00:18:00,959
but I promise you I'm not
gonna discuss it with him,

363
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:03,433
I'm certainly not gonna
discuss it with you.

364
00:18:03,502 --> 00:18:05,163
Do you have a light?

365
00:18:05,304 --> 00:18:09,035
And in conclusion, I think Lex
Luther said it best when he said,

366
00:18:09,108 --> 00:18:11,770
"Dad, you have no idea

367
00:18:12,244 --> 00:18:14,144
"what I'm capable of. "

368
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:16,306
That's from Superman?
Smallville.

369
00:18:16,382 --> 00:18:21,251
And that is why I feel
I deserve this raise.

370
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:27,682
Do you think Michael
and Jan actually...

371
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,391
I don't really wanna picture
it. But thank you, Pam.

372
00:18:31,463 --> 00:18:33,260
How do you
come back from that?

373
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:35,761
You don't,

374
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:37,961
I don't think, come
all the way back, you know.

375
00:18:38,037 --> 00:18:39,595
Especially working together.

376
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:41,697
No, I mean doing that
with Michael.

377
00:18:41,774 --> 00:18:44,607
How do you come back from that
as a human being?

378
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:47,009
Yeah. No,
I don't think you can.

379
00:18:47,646 --> 00:18:49,273
I'm heading back to New York.

380
00:18:49,348 --> 00:18:51,942
Alan and I will conduct
your performance review

381
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:53,109
over the phone tomorrow.

382
00:18:53,185 --> 00:18:54,652
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Okay? Good.

383
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,689
No, no, no, come...
I just want to know why.

384
00:18:57,756 --> 00:18:59,883
Michael, now is
not the time or the place.

385
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,823
Okay, so you're saying that
there is a different time or place

386
00:19:01,894 --> 00:19:02,918
that we could have
this discussion?

387
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:05,463
No. I am saying we are never
gonna have this conversation.

388
00:19:05,531 --> 00:19:08,659
Well, okay. What? Never?
As in never, ever, ever?

389
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:11,032
Or never as in
there's still a chance?

390
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:13,264
Never for me always means
never, ever, ever.

391
00:19:13,338 --> 00:19:17,468
I just want to know, from the
horse's mouth, what is the dealio?

392
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:18,908
You know, Michael...
Am I too short?

393
00:19:18,977 --> 00:19:20,706
Michael, it has nothing to do
with your looks, okay?

394
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:24,545
It's your personality. I mean,
you're obnoxious, and rude,

395
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:29,777
and stupid, and you do have
coffee breath, by the way.

396
00:19:29,855 --> 00:19:32,653
And I don't agree
about the B.O.,

397
00:19:32,725 --> 00:19:35,717
but you are very,
very inconsiderate.

398
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:38,655
Really?
Really. You're...

399
00:19:38,931 --> 00:19:40,523
You're a great guy, okay?

400
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,294
I appreciate that,
thank you.

401
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:43,766
And you were very sweet.

402
00:19:43,836 --> 00:19:46,737
And you stayed up with me
and talked to me

403
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:49,003
and cried with me,
and I appreciate that.

404
00:19:49,074 --> 00:19:50,701
No, I didn't. I was...
I don't cry.

405
00:19:50,776 --> 00:19:54,268
But I just am not in a place right now
where I'm looking for a relationship.

406
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:58,544
So, we can still work together,
we can still be friends, but...

407
00:20:00,953 --> 00:20:02,045
Okay?

408
00:20:03,222 --> 00:20:05,918
So my looks have
nothing to do with it?

409
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,781
Oh, God.

410
00:20:11,964 --> 00:20:15,900
Jan is not in a place where she feels
she can have a relationship right now,

411
00:20:15,968 --> 00:20:18,903
and it doesn't matter
how great a guy I am.

412
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:21,268
And that is all I needed.

413
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,968
I'm good. I can go home now.

414
00:20:33,486 --> 00:20:36,580
Hey, it's 12:20.
Where the hell's Dwight?

415
00:20:37,924 --> 00:20:38,982
No idea.

416
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,186
"Never missed a day," my ass.

417
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:53,671
I'm here! I'm here!

418
00:20:55,975 --> 00:20:57,670
I'm here. It's okay!
