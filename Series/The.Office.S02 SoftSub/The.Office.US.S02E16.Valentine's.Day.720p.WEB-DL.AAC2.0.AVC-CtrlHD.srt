1
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:04,899
I really like Valentine's Day
in this office.

2
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:06,564
It's kind of
like grade school.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,835
Everybody gives out
little presents and stuff.

4
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:13,039
Like, last year, Jim gave me this
card with Dwight's head on it.

5
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:16,083
It was horrifying
and funny and...

6
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,319
Phyllis.

7
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,087
You could just sign here.

8
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,085
Roy and I
are saving for the wedding.

9
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:32,462
So I made him promise not
to get me anything too big.

10
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:37,362
"Happy Valentine's Day, darling.
Love, Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. "

11
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:39,338
Isn't he sweet?
Oh, yeah.

12
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,566
Wow.

13
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:43,804
All right, Dwight, as you know
I'm heading to New York today,

14
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:47,609
doing a presentation
on the branch to the new CFO.

15
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:50,582
And you want me to come with
you. No. The opposite of that.

16
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:53,814
I will stay here and run
things on this end. Very good.

17
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:57,190
Question: Will you be seeing
Jan when you're in New York?

18
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:59,283
I probably will.
Why do you ask?

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,194
Well, it's Valentine's Day.
And you guys, you know...

20
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:05,755
Well.
... screwed.

21
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,698
What is your problem?

22
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:12,132
This is a business trip. I
would have to be a raving lunatic

23
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,936
to try to talk to Jan about
what happened between us.

24
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:18,536
Her words, not mine. She sent
me an e-mail this morning.

25
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:22,676
But it is Valentine's Day.

26
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,412
It's New York.
The City of Love.

27
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:31,648
Hey, Pam. You heart NY, right? You
want me to pick you up anything?

28
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,124
That's okay.
All right.

29
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:36,960
The best present would be, you do
a good job in front of the new CFO.

30
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:39,124
Dude. I'm going to nail it.

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,102
Me in New York? Oh, I own
that city. "Forget about it!"

32
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,065
See you.

33
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,707
Well, here we go,
on our way to New York.

34
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,241
New York, New York.

35
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,470
The city so nice,
they named it twice.

36
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,672
Manhattan is the other name.

37
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:30,815
So, I broke up with Katy and I
haven't been dating anybody else.

38
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,418
So, this year I don't have to
worry about Valentine's Day.

39
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,479
It's going to be good. I
invited a couple of friends over.

40
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,583
We're gonna play some cards and
I'll end up winning a lot of money,

41
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,628
because they're idiots.

42
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,262
It's gonna be great.

43
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,724
What's this? What is this?

44
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,633
I don't know.
It's on your desk.

45
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,366
Yeah, but who put it here?
And for what purpose?

46
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,340
It was there when I sat down.

47
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,916
"Happy Valentine's Day. "

48
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,391
It's me.

49
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,128
I'm the Bobble Head.

50
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,628
Yes!

51
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,671
The meeting isn't till 3:00.

52
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:32,234
But I always like to come to
New York a little bit early,

53
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:33,837
and hit
some of my favorite haunts.

54
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:37,350
Like right here is my
favorite New York pizza joint.

55
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,687
And I'm going to go get me
a New York slice.

56
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,755
Hey, Kelly, what's up?
Nothing.

57
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,925
Oh! Except... Oh, my God, Jim.

58
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:52,397
Last night, Ryan and I
totally, finally hooked up.

59
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,934
It was awesome. That's great.
I'm really happy for you.

60
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:57,971
I know, and it was so funny. 'Cause
we were at this bar with his friends,

61
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,938
and I was sitting next to him
the whole night,

62
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,066
and he wasn't making a move.
So in my head I was like,

63
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:05,578
"Ryan, what's taking you so
long?" And then he kissed me.

64
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,409
And I didn't know what to say. Wow.

65
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,075
So I said,"
Ryan, what took you so long?"

66
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,277
I mean, I just said it to him.
Can you believe that?

67
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,844
Wow. Oh, my God, Jim,
is that embarrassing?

68
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,753
I'm embarrassed.
No. Don't be.

69
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:19,588
Oh, thank God, because I was
nervous, Jim. No. All right...

70
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,890
You will not believe I
was so nervous. I bet.

71
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,795
But now... Now I have
a boyfriend. All right.

72
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:29,066
I hooked up with her
on February 13th.

73
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:35,300
Here it is. The heart of
New York City, Times Square.

74
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:39,779
Named for the good times
you have when you're in it.

75
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:41,947
Most people,
when they come to New York,

76
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,313
they go straight to
the Empire State Building.

77
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:46,444
That's pretty touristy.
I come here.

78
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,919
Great places to eat.

79
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:51,185
We have Bubba Gump shrimp,
Red Lobster down there.

80
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,725
You know...

81
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:56,193
This is the heart
of civilization, right here.

82
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,866
Guess what.
Really?

83
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,300
It's from Bob, again.
That's great.

84
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,442
Everybody takes
the subway in New York.

85
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:21,181
It's fast. It's efficient.
Gets you there on time.

86
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:26,151
It's a way to... Okay, there's a guy
pooping in a cardboard box down there.

87
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,426
This is the world-famous
Rockefeller Center,

88
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,623
founded, of course,
by Theodore Rockefeller.

89
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,461
This is the skating rink.

90
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,865
And I think the Rangers
practice there sometimes.

91
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,199
And it's...

92
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:39,967
That's Tina Fey.

93
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,073
That's Tina Fey
from Saturday Night Live.

94
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,379
Hello. Hello. Hi.

95
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:48,210
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

96
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:51,479
I thought you were...
Okay. I thought that was...

97
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:55,149
She looked like... She
looked a lot like Tina Fey.

98
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,716
Hello, hello.

99
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,486
I thought that was Tina Fey,
but it wasn't. So...

100
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,723
Are you serious? He was here?

101
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,764
When? When I was talking
to the fake Tina Fey?

102
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:06,766
Come on! Are you serious?

103
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,937
Hello, Angela, did you hear?

104
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:16,305
Somebody totally rocked the house and
got me the best present I've ever gotten.

105
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,936
Really? I wouldn't know
anything about that.

106
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:22,311
But I'm glad you enjoyed
it. Oh, I did. I did.

107
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,450
I didn't get anything
for Valentine's Day.

108
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,509
Oh, I bet you will,
before the day is over.

109
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:29,920
Really? Well, I hope I do.

110
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,798
I would love to live in New York
someday. It's a big dream of mine.

111
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,962
Work at Corporate with Jan.
That would be awesome.

112
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,562
Go to Broadway shows,
eat hot dogs.

113
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,403
Scranton is great, but...

114
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:51,808
New York
is like Scranton on acid.

115
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:56,812
No, on speed. No, on steroids.

116
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,376
Okay, um...

117
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,082
I think,

118
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:04,482
that's either the Hudson
or the East, so we're back...

119
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,526
Should be back this way.

120
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,187
There's a lot
of pressure on me right now.

121
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,756
It's like Michael Jordan
in the NBA finals,

122
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:16,632
or like
Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf.

123
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,263
And this presentation
is Desert Storm.

124
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,102
And as soon as it's over,

125
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,507
we will not have to deal
with those Iraqis anymore.

126
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,011
Let's do it.

127
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:32,262
No, that's all right. Spend money on her
instead of giving it to us, that's fine.

128
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:34,964
No. I didn't even have
a seat for you anyway.

129
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,233
Yeah.

130
00:07:37,842 --> 00:07:39,139
All right, man.

131
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,939
Okay, have a good night. Bye.

132
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:53,423
Phyllis Lapin?
Holy God.

133
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:54,753
It's from Bob.

134
00:07:54,826 --> 00:07:57,886
Man, that thing's bigger
than I am. No, it's not.

135
00:07:57,962 --> 00:07:59,054
Oh, zip it.
Wow.

136
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:00,824
There they are. What's up?

137
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,092
Hey.
Hey, hey.

138
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,930
Michael Scott.
Josh Porter. High five.

139
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:07,566
Bam.
All right.

140
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:10,004
You know Dan Gore, from
Buffalo? Yeah, how you doing?

141
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:12,406
Nobody needs to introduce
this guy. Craiggers.

142
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:14,603
What's up, buddy?
You have been kicked out

143
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:17,079
of every strip club in Albany,
is that true? Guilty, yeah.

144
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:19,776
Well... So, what's
going on? What'd I miss?

145
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:22,012
Not much. They're, I guess,
running late upstairs.

146
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:24,281
We're just waiting
for the presentations.

147
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:29,019
Cool, good, good. Good. Give
us some time to catch up and...

148
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:35,328
Pam.
Hi, how're you doing? Good.

149
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,697
Listen, may I speak with you,

150
00:08:38,202 --> 00:08:39,464
privately?

151
00:08:39,537 --> 00:08:41,732
You can't fire me, Dwight,
just 'cause Michael's not here.

152
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:43,774
No, Pam, just... I'm...

153
00:08:44,342 --> 00:08:45,639
Just...

154
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:47,405
Please.

155
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:48,809
You need to get something

156
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,474
for your girlfriend?
Girlfriend, yes.

157
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:54,109
And the reason I didn't get
anything for this particular person,

158
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:55,914
who shall remain nameless,

159
00:08:55,987 --> 00:09:00,617
is that she's not really the kind of person
you'd think would be into Valentine's Day.

160
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:03,858
She's kind of...
Tightly wound?

161
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:08,563
Exactly.
Okay. Well,

162
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,529
sometimes the gift is really
about the gesture, you know,

163
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:14,127
like, what it means
instead of what it is.

164
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:16,833
You mean, like a ham?

165
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:20,877
No, not like a ham.

166
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:24,043
It's about doing something,

167
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:26,777
so that the person knows that
you really care about her,

168
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:28,614
that you remember her.
Okay, I get it. That's great.

169
00:09:28,686 --> 00:09:31,154
Okay, shut up.
I know exactly what to do.

170
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,286
What about you, Craig?
Did you lose anyone?

171
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,554
Oh, man.

172
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:40,791
Jan called me in September, and she's
like, "You gotta fire four people,"

173
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:43,265
and I was just like,
"What?" You know.

174
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:48,294
Did you? No. I just ignored
her. She is the worst.

175
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:50,100
Well, she is our boss, so...

176
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,301
She ain't my boss, dude.
I don't work for that bitch.

177
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:54,435
Hey, come on,
you know, that's not...

178
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:55,672
What?
Cool it.

179
00:09:55,746 --> 00:09:58,010
You like Jan?
How can you like Jan?

180
00:09:58,082 --> 00:09:59,982
Maybe because
she's my girlfriend.

181
00:10:02,453 --> 00:10:04,819
Was. Or not my girlfriend.
She...

182
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:07,922
We hooked up and...
You hooked up with Jan?

183
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:11,450
It's just, you know, it was months
ago. Just... It was just once.

184
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:14,930
It was, God, just stupid.
Just... Just forget it.

185
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:17,559
Yeah, let's change the
subject. Yeah, yeah.

186
00:10:20,237 --> 00:10:21,329
I don't know
what he's thinking,

187
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:24,101
but I would just be so psyched
if we just dated forever.

188
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:26,837
Well, I'd take it slow.

189
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:30,642
'Cause it seems like a lot of the
time, things like that need to...

190
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:36,376
Soda.
Cool.

191
00:10:39,457 --> 00:10:43,917
Hey, so, do you want
to do something tonight, or...

192
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:46,327
Oh, no, not while I'm here.

193
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:48,388
I mean, I know that it's
Valentine's Day or whatever.

194
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:52,300
But there's totally no pressure at
all of any kind whatsoever. So...

195
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,066
I can't tonight.
I have plans with my friends.

196
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:58,136
Okay, that's cool.
Okay.

197
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:00,439
I completely understand.
Cool.

198
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:01,603
Okay.

199
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,392
Josh Porter, Stamford.

200
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:25,594
David.
Nice to meet you.

201
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:26,795
And Michael Scott, Scranton.

202
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:28,668
Nice to meet you.
Ditto.

203
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:31,264
How are you, Jan?
Fine, Michael, thank you.

204
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:35,110
Okay. So, we are in the process
of doing a complete review

205
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:36,669
of the company's
financial strength.

206
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:38,476
All I'd like to do today
is to hear you...

207
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:40,312
Nervous?
No, I'm not nervous.

208
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:43,649
Well, I mean, I guess I'd be lying if
I didn't say I was a little nervous.

209
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:45,780
The new CFO
is judging me on this, too.

210
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:48,188
And, well,
it is Michael, so...

211
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,155
Yeah. I am very nervous.

212
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:53,287
So, with the 12 new
local accounts,

213
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:56,265
we had a total of
four percent organic growth,

214
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:59,859
which was just above our pre-year
targets. Thanks very much.

215
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:02,997
Thank you.
Okay, Michael.

216
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:10,942
What is a business?

217
00:12:11,215 --> 00:12:15,709
Is it a collection of numbers
and sales reports?

218
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:19,381
Sure. But, as you know,
David, and Jan,

219
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:21,049
it is much more.

220
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,169
Life moves a little slower
in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

221
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:45,780
And that's the way we like it.

222
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,318
Because at Dunder Mifflin,
Scranton,

223
00:12:48,385 --> 00:12:50,945
we're not just
in the paper business.

224
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,285
We're in the people business.

225
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:55,485
Let's meet some of the folks

226
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:58,392
who make the Scranton branch
so special.

227
00:12:58,963 --> 00:13:03,366
This is Stanley Hudson,
one of our talented salesmen.

228
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:06,100
An African-American
father of two,

229
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,537
Stanley's dedication is no
doubt one of the hallmarks

230
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:13,771
of the foundation of the business
we're hoping to build our basis on.

231
00:13:14,945 --> 00:13:17,072
Yeah, I shot a bunch
of footage around the office,

232
00:13:17,148 --> 00:13:19,616
edited it together on my Mac.

233
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:23,016
Was thinking about entering it
in some festivals. Probably won't.

234
00:13:23,087 --> 00:13:25,487
You know,
not what this is about, but...

235
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:28,624
And finally,
Pam Beesly.

236
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:31,092
Look at her. Look how cute.

237
00:13:31,162 --> 00:13:33,130
Not bad at all.

238
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:34,959
As the receptionist,

239
00:13:35,032 --> 00:13:38,729
Pam is truly
the gateway to our world.

240
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:42,535
Well, I hope this gave you
a little taste

241
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:45,769
of what life is like here
at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.

242
00:13:45,843 --> 00:13:48,937
What it's like to walk
a mile in Oscar's shoes,

243
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:51,106
or try on Phyllis' pants.

244
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:55,849
Next time you're in town,
give us a call. Stop on by.

245
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,583
I'm sure you'll be greeted by a big
smile, and a "How're you doing, pal?"

246
00:13:59,657 --> 00:14:02,490
Maybe even one of Angela's
famous brownies.

247
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,562
And you'll know
that you're home.

248
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:17,103
Great Scott!

249
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:20,340
Questions?

250
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,404
Wow.

251
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,578
Okay. Okay, thank you,
Michael, that was great.

252
00:14:27,652 --> 00:14:28,846
Yes, thank you.

253
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,220
But for right now, what I'd really like
to know about is the branch's performance.

254
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,089
So, do you have
that information as well?

255
00:14:36,895 --> 00:14:39,659
Yes. Absolutely, David.

256
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:42,291
Let me get that for you. I...

257
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:49,337
Can you sign?
Yeah.

258
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:51,503
Oscar.

259
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:54,174
Nothing for me?
Join the club.

260
00:14:57,849 --> 00:15:00,215
Who's it from?
My mom.

261
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,766
It's frustrating, 'cause
we'd be so perfect together.

262
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:18,795
You know what?
Here's the deal, Kelly.

263
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,772
It would be really nice if he was
into you, right? It'd be great.

264
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:26,277
But he isn't. So... Yeah, but
it would be so great if he was.

265
00:15:26,344 --> 00:15:28,972
Well, he's not, though.
So you just gotta suck it up.

266
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:32,016
You just gotta move on,
try to have some fun.

267
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,074
Come to my poker game tonight.

268
00:15:34,152 --> 00:15:35,551
Okay, cool.

269
00:15:36,087 --> 00:15:38,214
Is it okay if I invite Ryan?

270
00:15:45,463 --> 00:15:47,590
And that about does it,
thank you.

271
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:48,825
Okay.

272
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,562
Craig.

273
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:54,770
Yeah, here's the deal.
I did not understand

274
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,299
that this was supposed to be a
full-on, like, report or whatnot.

275
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:04,212
I'm sorry, what did you think
financial presentation meant?

276
00:16:04,282 --> 00:16:08,685
I was under the impression this was more
of, like, a meet-and-greet type deal.

277
00:16:08,987 --> 00:16:12,946
So, does that mean that you don't
have the numbers on your branch?

278
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:14,821
That is correct. Yes.

279
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:17,885
Craig, you realize
that we're trying to decide

280
00:16:17,962 --> 00:16:19,953
whether drastic steps
need to be taken.

281
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:21,623
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

282
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:25,362
Well, the point is, that this doesn't
exactly bode well for your branch.

283
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:26,630
Oh, man. You know what?

284
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:30,037
Michael made that stupid movie,
he doesn't get in any trouble.

285
00:16:30,108 --> 00:16:32,838
Maybe I should have
slept with you, too.

286
00:16:37,782 --> 00:16:41,650
Okay, okay. All right, this... No,
no, no. I'm not... I'm not... I just...

287
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:44,187
I just don't know
what to do anymore, Michael.

288
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:46,223
I mean,
I'm probably gonna get fired.

289
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,519
No, you're not.

290
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:50,755
Yeah, I... Michael, the CFO
thinks that we slept together.

291
00:16:50,828 --> 00:16:53,388
Don't you understand? People
get fired for much less.

292
00:16:53,464 --> 00:16:57,366
And I just can't believe
that you told everybody.

293
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:59,300
And we didn't even
sleep together.

294
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,237
Technically, we fell asleep
in the same bed.

295
00:17:02,307 --> 00:17:03,865
So...
Oh, God.

296
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:05,534
Michael, it was months ago.

297
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,874
It was once. It's over.

298
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:11,475
Do you understand?

299
00:17:13,151 --> 00:17:15,711
Yes, I'm sorry.

300
00:17:17,322 --> 00:17:21,588
I'll fix it. I will talk
to him. I'll talk to David.

301
00:17:22,594 --> 00:17:24,755
Surely, you cannot be serious.

302
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,296
I am serious.

303
00:17:26,364 --> 00:17:29,094
"And don't call me Shirley. "
Airplane!

304
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:40,608
Women are like wolves.

305
00:17:40,678 --> 00:17:43,647
If you want a wolf,
you have to trap it.

306
00:17:43,948 --> 00:17:45,813
You have to snare it.

307
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:48,045
And then you have to tame it.

308
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:50,485
Keep it happy.
Care for it. Feed it.

309
00:17:50,555 --> 00:17:53,752
Lovingly. The way an
animal deserves to be loved.

310
00:17:55,727 --> 00:17:58,457
And my animal deserves
a lot of loving.

311
00:18:03,101 --> 00:18:04,864
Hey, babe.
Hey.

312
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:07,837
You almost ready to go?
I guess. Yeah.

313
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:10,264
What's wrong?
Nothing.

314
00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:12,036
It's just that
I had to sit here all day

315
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,307
while Phyllis got, like, an
entire garden delivered to her.

316
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,007
What? You're mad at me?

317
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:19,846
I mean, I know that we said,
"No big gifts,"

318
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:22,977
but I was, kind of, hoping you'd
get me something for Valentine's Day.

319
00:18:23,054 --> 00:18:25,454
Well, Valentine's Day
isn't over.

320
00:18:25,523 --> 00:18:29,653
Let's get you home and you are
gonna get the best sex of your life.

321
00:18:32,463 --> 00:18:34,522
You understand this is
a very serious situation.

322
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,396
No, no, no, no, no.
Yes, I... Okay, well...

323
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:39,436
All right, here's the deal. This
is my fault, this is totally on me.

324
00:18:39,504 --> 00:18:42,200
Before you guys came in,
I was talking to the guys.

325
00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:45,299
We were all chatting
and I made a joke,

326
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:48,834
a really dumb joke, and Craig,
the idiot, took it seriously.

327
00:18:48,913 --> 00:18:51,780
You made a joke?
I did. It was stupid.

328
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:55,808
And Craig, you saw him, he's not
the sharpest tool in the shed.

329
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:58,187
Although he is a tool.

330
00:18:58,823 --> 00:19:01,189
Well, I don't need to explain
to you that even a joke

331
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:03,159
about sexual relations
with your boss...

332
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:05,092
I know.
It was borderline at best.

333
00:19:05,163 --> 00:19:09,190
And Jan
is a fantastic executive

334
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:12,065
and has all the integrity
in the world and...

335
00:19:13,204 --> 00:19:16,435
I'm really sorry, and that
will never happen again.

336
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:23,645
That's fine.
Let's just... Just forget it.

337
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:25,342
Okay. Good.

338
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,328
Heading out?
Yeah.

339
00:19:39,397 --> 00:19:42,525
All right, Beesly.
Hey, Happy Valentine's Day.

340
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:44,995
Bye.

341
00:19:49,574 --> 00:19:52,099
Good night, Pam.
Night, Phyllis.

342
00:19:57,215 --> 00:19:58,477
Michael.

343
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:00,942
Thank you again for that,
really.

344
00:20:01,018 --> 00:20:02,645
It was very nice.
Oh, no big deal.

345
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,486
Really, sorry again. Oh, no,
it's okay. Yeah, it's okay.

346
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:10,021
So... Happy Valentine's Day.

347
00:20:10,094 --> 00:20:12,324
Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day.

348
00:20:19,971 --> 00:20:21,097
Okay.
