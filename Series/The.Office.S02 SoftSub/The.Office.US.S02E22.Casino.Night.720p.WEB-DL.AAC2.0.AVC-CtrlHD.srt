1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:04,631
Tonight the Scranton Business
Park is having Casino Night

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,366
and we are converting
our warehouse

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,499
into a full-blown
gambling hall.

4
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:11,010
And I know it's illegal
in Pennsylvania,

5
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:12,306
but it's for charity.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,613
And I consider myself
a great philanderer.

7
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,913
It's just... It's nice to
know, at the end of the day,

8
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:19,452
I can look in the mirror
and say,

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,547
"Michael, because of you,
some little kid in the Congo

10
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:26,354
"has a belly full of rice
this evening. "

11
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,295
Makes you feel good.

12
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:42,172
Excuse me. How long is the
wait for a table for two?

13
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,941
I would never,
ever serve you.

14
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,537
Not in a million,
billion years.

15
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,241
It's a nice tux.

16
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,910
I know. It belonged
to my grandfather.

17
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:55,080
He was buried in it,
so family heirloom.

18
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,059
So, what's the deal? We
gotta pay for our own drinks?

19
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:02,959
That's lame.
Come on, it'll be fun,

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,429
and besides,
I'm a roulette expert.

21
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:07,331
Impossible. Roulette
is not a game of skill,

22
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,198
it is a game of chance.

23
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:10,834
I can always kind of
win at roulette.

24
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:11,963
Oh, really?

25
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,063
Mmm-hmm.

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,040
Yeah.
How would you do that?

27
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:17,133
Mind control.

28
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:18,777
You can't be serious.

29
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:21,874
Are you serious?

30
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:25,344
Ever since I was a little kid,
like, eight or nine,

31
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,388
I could sort of
control things with my mind.

32
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,814
I don't believe you. Continue.

33
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,358
It was just little things,
you know,

34
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,723
like I could make
something shake

35
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,261
or I could make a marble
fall off the counter.

36
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,126
You know, just little things.

37
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,566
That's ridiculous.
You know what?

38
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:42,624
Uh...

39
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,135
Why don't you move
that coat rack?

40
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,566
Excuse me, everyone!

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,733
Attention
in the office, please.

42
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:51,539
Jim is about to prove
his telekinetic powers

43
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,603
and he needs absolute silence.

44
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,378
Go ahead.

45
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,474
Okay, I'll try.

46
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,711
Oh, my God.

47
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,787
I try not to think of it
as lagging behind.

48
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,450
It's more of a David-and-Goliath
thing. Yeah, but...

49
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,958
Well, the fact
of the matter is

50
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,619
that your branch
is currently number four

51
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,287
of the five branches
that I oversee.

52
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,830
Top 80%!

53
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,825
Michael?
Yeah?

54
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,029
You know that I'm
very serious here.

55
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:25,799
Jan, listen, I promise that I
will kick it up a notch. Bam!

56
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,162
What?

57
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:30,300
Emeril. Oh, actually,
while I have you,

58
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,039
not that I have you
or have ever had you,

59
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,876
but we're having
our Casino Night tonight

60
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,975
and I think everyone would love
to see their fearless leader here.

61
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,920
I thought that you were
their fearless leader.

62
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:45,789
I am, but you are the Eva
Peron to my Cesar Chavez.

63
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,789
I think you can handle it.

64
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,490
Oh, come on. Come on.
I think so, Michael...

65
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,827
You know, it'd be fun.

66
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,801
I can hear it in your voice.
You need a break.

67
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,399
Goodbye, Michael.

68
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,965
Jan and I understand
each other.

69
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,203
The romance thing is sort of
on hold for the time being,

70
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:06,007
but we've remained
good friends.

71
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,105
Good friends
with privileges.

72
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,043
Not now, some day.

73
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,245
Okay, everybody.

74
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,288
Tonight's event is to benefit
the Boy Scouts of America.

75
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:17,290
Again. We do that every year.

76
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,586
Well, they need our money.

77
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,593
They don't have cookies
like the Girl Scouts.

78
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:23,459
It'd be nice to do something for
people who are actually suffering.

79
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,760
Well, Oscar,
if you don't like it,

80
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,097
then you should
concentrate on winning.

81
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:32,872
Because the person at the end of the
evening with the highest chip count

82
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,238
will receive $500 to donate
to the charity of their choice.

83
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,278
And they will get
a mini-fridge,

84
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:40,870
compliments
of Vance Refrigeration.

85
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,006
Yes.
So,

86
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,572
get your charities in to Pam.

87
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:46,245
I, for example,
am playing for Comic Relief.

88
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,413
That doesn't exist anymore.

89
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,558
Comedy's very much alive,
as are homeless people.

90
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,059
No, they stopped
making that show.

91
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,889
Well, then, they need
our money more than ever.

92
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,728
You have to pick an approved,
non-profit organization.

93
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,200
There's a great soup kitchen
in downtown Scranton.

94
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,260
Delicious pea soup
on Thursdays.

95
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:06,203
I'll probably
give the money to them.

96
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,373
Something with animals.

97
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,573
Or people.

98
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:14,603
Kobe Bryant has a foundation,
and he is so hot.

99
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:17,741
And he gave his wife
the biggest diamond ring.

100
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,752
I know he didn't do it.

101
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,147
Maybe he did it.

102
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:26,191
We are giving money
that has been gambled.

103
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,027
Why don't we just deal drugs
or prostitute ourselves,

104
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,927
and donate that money
to charity?

105
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,463
Oh, and another fun thing.

106
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,067
We, at the end of the night,

107
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,659
are going to give the check

108
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:39,228
to an actual group
of Boy Scouts.

109
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,398
Right, Toby? We're gonna...

110
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:43,170
Actually, I didn't think it was
appropriate to invite children

111
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:46,940
since it's... You know,
there's gambling and alcohol,

112
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,278
and it's in
our dangerous warehouse

113
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,817
and it's a school night...

114
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:55,679
And, you know, Hooters is
catering. You know, is that enough?

115
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,020
Should I keep going?

116
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,652
Why are you
the way that you are?

117
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,860
Honestly, every time I try to
do something fun or exciting,

118
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:09,732
you make it not that way.

119
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,405
I hate

120
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:16,775
so much about the things
that you choose to be.

121
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:19,735
Okay, you know what?

122
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:24,341
I will not donate my winnings
to Comic Relief,

123
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,942
since apparently
it doesn't exist.

124
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:29,455
I am going to donate
to Afghanistanis with AIDS.

125
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:32,014
I think you mean
the aid to Afghanistan.

126
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,788
No, I mean
Afghanistanis with AIDS.

127
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,124
Afghani.

128
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,925
What?
Afghani.

129
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,330
That's a dog.
No, that's Afghan.

130
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,425
That's a shawl.

131
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,867
Wait, canine AIDS?
No.

132
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,699
Humans with AIDS.
Who has AIDS?

133
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:46,501
Guys, the Afghanistananies.

134
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,269
Okay, you know what? No. No.

135
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:51,839
AIDS is not funny.

136
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,976
Believe me, I have tried.

137
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,115
There are certain topics that
are off-limits to comedians,

138
00:06:57,184 --> 00:07:00,620
JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust.

139
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,654
The Lincoln Assassination
just recently became funny.

140
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:04,952
I need to see this play

141
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,016
like I need
a hole in the head.

142
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,792
And I hope to someday
live in a world

143
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,958
where a person could tell
a hilarious AIDS joke.

144
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,929
It's one of my dreams.

145
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:19,103
What are you doing?
Oh, nothing.

146
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,665
"Till Death Do Us Rock. "

147
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:25,169
They're wedding bands.
Oh.

148
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,576
Roy was supposed to
pick the band,

149
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,207
but he's concentrating more
on the bachelor party now.

150
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,409
Wait, wait, where you going?

151
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,475
I mean, even if you
don't hire a band,

152
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,453
you still have to
watch the bands.

153
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:38,619
Pam, these are people who have
never given up on their dreams.

154
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,660
I have great respect for that.

155
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:43,527
And, yes, they're all
probably very bad

156
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:46,930
and that will make me feel
better about not having dreams.

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,934
There's a KISS
cover band in here.

158
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,299
Let's do it.

159
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,205
I'm pretty happy these days.

160
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:57,539
I'm getting married soon and I'm
getting along with everybody at work.

161
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:01,438
Why did I talk to Jan
about transferring?

162
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,040
Well, you know.

163
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,317
I have no future here.

164
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,854
I have already
put down the deposit.

165
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,120
Do you understand
how a deposit works?

166
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:17,595
Mike, I am not having
fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.

167
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,962
It's Casino Night
like Las Vegas.

168
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,364
There are fire-eaters
all over the place.

169
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:22,493
Except my warehouse.

170
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,093
Well, actually,
it's my warehouse.

171
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,139
Actually, it's owned
by Beakman Properties,

172
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:29,266
and Dunder Mifflin is four
years into a seven-year lease.

173
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,004
Why are you here?

174
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,170
When Darryl was coming, you said
you wanted me here for protection.

175
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,004
Not.

176
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,311
I said, not that.

177
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,781
We just have a lot of stuff
down there that could be stolen.

178
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,756
That's ironic.
What?

179
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,822
That you are afraid.

180
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,693
Why? 'Cause I'm
from the hood?

181
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,924
Dinkin flicka.

182
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:54,791
Dinkin flicka.

183
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,002
I taught Mike some phrases

184
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,801
to help with his interracial
conversations.

185
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,508
You know, stuff like,
"Fleece it out. "

186
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:06,239
"Going mach five. "
"Dinkin flicka. "

187
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,512
You know, things
us Negroes say.

188
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,183
Give me some.

189
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,522
Oh, yeah, I taught him
a handshake, too.

190
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:41,405
Wow.

191
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,607
I don't know how
you're gonna decide.

192
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,548
They are all extremely good.

193
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:45,915
I think I should
hire them all.

194
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,351
Do like Lollapalooza.
Yes.

195
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,888
Have three stages, yeah.

196
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,651
Your mom would love that.

197
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:51,952
She would.

198
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,694
Oh, this band is called
Scrantonicity. Oh.

199
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,785
Let's take a look.

200
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,425
Nice.
Oh, wait.

201
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,164
That's Kevin.

202
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,595
On the drums.
What?

203
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:03,693
On the drums! On the drums!

204
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,170
Oh, my God, that's Kevin!

205
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,900
Great song, Kev.

206
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,609
Oh, my God, he's the
drummer and the singer.

207
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:15,307
We really don't do
a lot of weddings.

208
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,780
We actually don't play
in public very often.

209
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,782
We are all really hoping
that Pam's wedding works out.

210
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:26,348
This could be
a turning point for the band.

211
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,153
Wow. Oh!
Oh, my...

212
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:32,027
Yeah, you haven't
seen that since 1983.

213
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,859
That is amazing.

214
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:35,992
Okay, we have to sign him.

215
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,400
I'm gonna call the label,
we're gonna... No! No!

216
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,768
No, Pam, you're gonna
loose him to another wedding.

217
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:39,828
No, come back! No, no, no!

218
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:40,895
Kev!

219
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:42,407
Jim is great.

220
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:46,276
Being with him just takes away all
the stress of planning my wedding.

221
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,175
Yes?
Michael, Carol Stills for you.

222
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,446
Who?
Carol Stills.

223
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,118
Do I know a Carol Stills?
Your realtor.

224
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,214
Oh, yeah, put her through.

225
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:02,523
Hey, Carol, how goes the real
estate biz? Is it real good?

226
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,021
It's still me.

227
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,496
Sometimes I don't put
Michael through

228
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,556
until he's already
said something.

229
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,364
I look at it as
a practice run for him.

230
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,667
He usually does better
on the second attempt.

231
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,071
Carol, you're on with Michael.

232
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,610
Hello, Michael?
Hi, Carol. How you doing?

233
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:21,169
I'm great. I just needed one last
signature for your mortgage insurance.

234
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,216
Oh, hey, no problemo.

235
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,716
Incidentally,
I love the place.

236
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:25,945
Oh, great.
Great.

237
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,112
It has a little bit
of a weird smell. It's okay.

238
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,746
At Christmas, the tree helped.

239
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,415
Oh, good, I'm glad.

240
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:33,618
Can I drop it over later?

241
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:37,494
Actually, I'm sort of hosting
this charity thing

242
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:39,496
in our warehouse,
Casino Night.

243
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,000
Oh, great.
Yeah, it'll be good.

244
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,593
You know what?
Why don't you come by?

245
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,161
Bring the papers,
I'll sign them

246
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,173
and then you can stay
and have a drink.

247
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,868
To the casino thing?
Yeah.

248
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,070
It'll be fun. What do you...

249
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,169
What do you...
What?

250
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:55,373
Oh, I'm sorry.
Could you hold on?

251
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:57,542
Yes? Michael, Jan's on line two.

252
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,482
Okay, put her through.

253
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,417
Jan Levinson, I presume?

254
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,314
It's still me.

255
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,120
Jan, here's Michael.

256
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,992
Michael?
Hey, Jan. How you doing?

257
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,827
You know, I...
I thought about it

258
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,924
and you are right.

259
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,498
I am?
I could use a little fun.

260
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,404
So, I am going to drive up
for your Casino Night.

261
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:22,271
Oh, okay.

262
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:25,641
Incidentally, what is the charity? AIDS.

263
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:30,014
Okay, then.
I will see you tonight.

264
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,080
Okay, sounds great.

265
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,909
Bye-bye.
Bye.

266
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,114
Hello, Carol?
Hi, sorry about that.

267
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,091
I just...
No problemo.

268
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,820
Right.

269
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,856
To answer your question.
Yeah?

270
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:45,989
Yes.

271
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,931
What?
I'd love to go.

272
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,125
Okay.

273
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,227
I have to get a sitter, but
that shouldn't be a problem.

274
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,532
Problem. Good.

275
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,439
And I'll bring the papers,
too. Good. All right.

276
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,207
Sounds great.
I'll see you tonight.

277
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,609
Bye.
Bye.

278
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,978
Two queens on Casino Night.

279
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,984
I am going to drop
a deuce on everybody.

280
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,127
Oh, my God!
Yeah!

281
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:25,730
That's great.

282
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:26,898
Hey, hey.
Hi.

283
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:27,997
Hey, Carol.
Hi.

284
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:30,703
You look great. Thanks.
Thank you for inviting me.

285
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:33,268
It looks so great in here.
Oh, well... Kiss.

286
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:39,007
That's how we do it
in the paper biz.

287
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:41,714
It's European and... Yes?

288
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,119
Dwight.

289
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,094
Code name RelMax is here.

290
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:50,754
No sign of Lan Jevinson.

291
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:54,923
I'm Michael's wingman.
I've got his back. Two dates.

292
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,398
He's got two dates tonight.

293
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:01,638
My job is to keep Jan away
from Carol and vice versa.

294
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,708
Michael said,
"We must deceive them,

295
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:09,272
"so as not to hurt them, and
in that way, we honor them. "

296
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:13,385
Can I get you a drink?

297
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,683
The food is from Hooters.

298
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:17,587
Drink would be good.
Okay.

299
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,894
Oh, I steal things
all the time.

300
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,658
It's just something I do.

301
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,596
I stopped caring
a long time ago.

302
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,429
You should see
how many supplies

303
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:30,129
I've taken from this place.

304
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,904
Honestly, I love
stealing things.

305
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,807
I'm gonna get a drink.
Do you need anything?

306
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,810
No, I'm fine. Thanks, sweetheart. Okay.

307
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,648
Billy, your nurse is hot.

308
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,747
That's my girlfriend.

309
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:48,515
Your nurse became
your girlfriend? Sweet.

310
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:52,285
She was never my nurse. I met her
at Chili's. She was my waitress.

311
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,354
Chili's is great.

312
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:08,807
And welcome to Monte Carlo!

313
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:10,970
Dwight.

314
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,338
I am no longer your boss.

315
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:17,215
Lady Fortune is your boss.

316
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,815
Will Lady Fortune
give me a raise?

317
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,284
Shut it, shut it, shut it.

318
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,583
Will Lady Fortune
be your mistress?

319
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:26,683
Only time will tell,
my friends.

320
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,761
Leave all your preconceived
notions about casinos at the door.

321
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:35,457
Old friends, new lovers,

322
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:40,034
and the disabled,
welcome, all.

323
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,040
Great, okay.

324
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:45,373
Shuffle up and deal.
Let's get it started.

325
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,003
Black-Eyed Crows.

326
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,005
Okay, the game is
No-Limit Texas Hold'em.

327
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:51,775
Good luck, everybody.

328
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:58,324
That's at least
four red chips to you, sir.

329
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,257
All-in.

330
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,663
Bluffing is a key part of
poker, which is too bad,

331
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:11,431
because I'm not
very good at bluffing.

332
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:13,668
Did you believe me?

333
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:16,940
I'll call.

334
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,276
What are...

335
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,505
That's insane.
I have good cards.

336
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,574
Well, Toby, I went all-in
on the first hand,

337
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,143
so doesn't that tell you that
I might have good cards, too?

338
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,314
So, don't be stupid.
Just take it back.

339
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,325
No, I'm sorry. He can't, sir. He's
gone all-in. Okay, all right, whatever.

340
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:34,758
Flip them.

341
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:41,396
You really screwed that up.

342
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,428
Wow.

343
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,029
I don't really play cards,
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

344
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:50,201
It felt really good
to take money from Michael.

345
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:53,174
Gonna chase that feeling.

346
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,614
He asked the man a question.

347
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,643
I expect to do
very well tonight.

348
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:01,346
I have an acute ability
to read people.

349
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:04,185
Jim, for instance,
has a huge tell.

350
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:07,556
When he gets a good hand,
he coughs.

351
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:11,453
I will raise.

352
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:19,532
Thanks.

353
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,642
It's the weirdest thing.
Every time I cough, he folds.

354
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,808
Wow, bad luck.
Yeah, whatever.

355
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,281
Hey, you know what?
If luck weren't involved,

356
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,875
I would always be winning.

357
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,344
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

358
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,211
Michael?

359
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,581
Jan.
Hi.

360
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,525
Look, okay, I think
we're all adults here,

361
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,255
and it has always been
my understanding

362
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,299
that we have
an open relationship.

363
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,692
What are you... Just...

364
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,132
Wait, what're you
talking about?

365
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,166
What does that mean?

366
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,798
After you said you weren't
coming, I invited Carol to come

367
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:57,468
and I don't think
that I did anything wrong.

368
00:17:58,478 --> 00:17:59,467
No.

369
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,508
No, you didn't.
Hi, I'm Jan.

370
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,344
I'm Michael's boss.
Hi, hi.

371
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,485
Does anyone want a drink?
No, I'm good.

372
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:07,675
Okay.

373
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:13,514
Um...

374
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,561
Hey, hey.
Hey. What...

375
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:18,929
Jan's here.

376
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,503
Give me the dice.
Come on, Dwight.

377
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,198
Let's go.
It's all on you, baby.

378
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,261
Let's go.

379
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,365
Good evening, Dwight.
What is this?

380
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,603
Evening, Angela.
This is craps.

381
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,703
I need to roll an eight.
If I do, everyone wins.

382
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,077
Yes.
Then roll an eight.

383
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,172
All right.

384
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,145
Thank you, Angela.
Good luck, Dwight.

385
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,911
Yeah! Yeah!

386
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,352
That's good stuff.

387
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,153
Dwight, let's keep it going.
Let's keep it going.

388
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,958
Let's go. Let it ride. Let it all ride.

389
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:52,157
Give me the dice!

390
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:01,934
Yeah, right.

391
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,169
"Yeah, right," what?
What was this?

392
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:08,378
I have good cards.
Really?

393
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,848
And I'm gonna take you all-in. Wow.

394
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:15,254
I think you're bluffing.

395
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:27,930
Yeah, I think
she's full of it.

396
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,763
Straight.
Oh.

397
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:35,397
Three nines.
Pam.

398
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,307
Jim Halpert,
ladies and gentlemen.

399
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:40,710
Thank you very much.
It was fun.

400
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,907
Cosmopolitan, please.

401
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,713
Can I get a red wine?

402
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,918
So, two hours?
That's a long drive.

403
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,656
Well, it's part of the job,
you know?

404
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,887
Keep an eye on things. So...

405
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:57,891
Why not?

406
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,768
So, how long have you
and Michael been...

407
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:12,106
Oh, well, actually, I guess
this would be our first date.

408
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,705
I guess. Casino Night in the warehouse.

409
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,147
Good sport.

410
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:20,184
Well, I'm having a
nice time. Oh, me, too.

411
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,316
Me, too.

412
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:31,254
One beer
and one Seven and Seven

413
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:32,457
with eight
maraschino cherries,

414
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:35,057
sugar on the rim,
blended if you can.

415
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:39,161
So, that's still going
on, huh? You and Kelly?

416
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,539
All right! The point is
four. Shooter, roll it. Four!

417
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,909
Come on, shooter!
Four!

418
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,604
Shooter!
Blow.

419
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:50,911
Blow for luck! Yeah!
Shooter!

420
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:54,013
Also, you.
Not playing favorites.

421
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,849
All right, here we go!

422
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,446
All right.
Yeah!

423
00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:59,549
Five.
So close.

424
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:00,752
Well...
So close.

425
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:01,816
Come on.

426
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:03,860
So, where you staying?
Radisson?

427
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,192
What?
Super 8?

428
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,062
No, I...
Motel 6? Best Western?

429
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,260
I didn't... I don't know...
Holiday Inn?

430
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,127
The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre?

431
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:13,695
You staying with Michael?
All right!

432
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:22,979
I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit
Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament

433
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,780
at the World Series
of Poker in Vegas.

434
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,479
So, yeah...

435
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:28,987
I'm pretty good at poker.

436
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:33,985
All-in.

437
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:35,551
Okay, let's do it.

438
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,256
Good luck, honey.
Oh, thank you, Bobby.

439
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,163
But it doesn't matter,
it's just fun to play.

440
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,631
Three queens.
Nice, very nice.

441
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:44,898
I have an ace.
No, that's a flush.

442
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,165
Oh, man!

443
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:48,434
Oh, I have a flush!
Yes!

444
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:50,908
Look, I won. Look,
I have all the clovers.

445
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,308
You wanna play again?

446
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:53,941
I suck.

447
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,281
She took you down, huh?

448
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:00,683
I do not want
to talk about it.

449
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:03,655
Hey, I saw your tape.

450
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:06,659
Your band, Scrantonicity?
You guys rock.

451
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:07,716
Yeah?

452
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:10,422
Yeah, you guys
wanna play our wedding?

453
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:14,091
Awesome. Did Pam
say it was okay?

454
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:17,062
Whatever.
I'm in charge of the music.

455
00:22:17,137 --> 00:22:19,662
Dude, you will not be sorry.

456
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,600
Sweet.

457
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,808
All right.
All right.

458
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:35,013
Smoke?
No, thanks.

459
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:38,515
You having fun?

460
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,728
Fabulous time.

461
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:47,894
I drove two and half hours
to get here.

462
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:52,129
Yeah, we all really... Left
work early, drove down here.

463
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,935
And I am completely
underdressed.

464
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,805
Well, I think
you look great.

465
00:22:59,346 --> 00:23:01,871
Why did I hook up
with Michael?

466
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:06,346
Yeah, why did you?

467
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,284
It was very late, Jim. Very...

468
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:12,015
Very late and...

469
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:16,153
Have you given any more
thought to the transfer?

470
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:17,891
Oh, yeah.

471
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:19,056
Good.

472
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:23,132
Have you told anyone?

473
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,471
No.
Well, you should.

474
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:36,209
Excuse me.

475
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:38,011
Big moment.

476
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:40,586
The evening's chip leader

477
00:23:40,954 --> 00:23:44,321
and winner of this beautiful
mini-refrigerator

Vance Refrigeration,

Creed Bratton, Dunder Mifflin.

480
00:23:55,135 --> 00:23:57,729
Thanks. I never
owned a refrigerator.

481
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,710
Sorry, babe. I am just beat.

482
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:05,802
It's okay.

483
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:07,469
I'll see you at home.
Okay.

484
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:09,538
Hey, don't try to lose
too much money, all right?

485
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:12,016
Okay. If you still want a honeymoon.

486
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,210
Hey, Halpert.

487
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,950
Keep an eye on her, all
right? Okay, will do.

488
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,616
See you.
Bye!

489
00:24:22,162 --> 00:24:23,891
Hey.
Hey, how's it going?

490
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:27,400
Good, especially after I
took all your money in poker.

491
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:28,693
Yeah.

492
00:24:31,705 --> 00:24:33,570
Hey, can I talk to you
about something?

493
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,403
About when you want to
give me more of your money?

494
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:36,703
No, I...
Did you wanna do that now?

495
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:38,266
We can go inside.

496
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:40,336
I'm feeling
kind of good tonight.

497
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:41,880
I was just...

498
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,483
I'm in love with you.

499
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:48,947
What?

500
00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:52,850
I'm really sorry if that's
weird for you to hear,

501
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:55,690
but I needed you
to hear it.

502
00:24:58,565 --> 00:25:01,432
Probably not good timing,
I know that. I just...

503
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,196
What are you doing?

504
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:09,167
What do you expect me
to say to that?

505
00:25:10,644 --> 00:25:12,703
I just needed you to know.

506
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:14,973
Once.

507
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:18,848
Well, I...

508
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:21,545
I...

509
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,052
I can't.

510
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:27,520
Yeah.

511
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:32,127
You have no idea...
Don't do that.

512
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,790
...what your friendship
means to me.

513
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:37,302
Come on. I don't
wanna do that.

514
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,731
I wanna be more than that.

515
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:41,969
I can't.

516
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:46,774
I'm really sorry

517
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:50,311
if you misinterpreted things.

518
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:55,020
It's probably my fault.

519
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:58,420
Not your fault.

520
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,992
I'm sorry I misinterpreted
our friendship.

521
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:12,429
Hey.

522
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:14,299
I'm leaving.
Hey, okay.

523
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:16,672
So, I just wanted to congratulate
you on a fantastic evening.

524
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,233
You did the company proud.
Thank you.

525
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:20,779
And thanks for inviting me.
You were right, I needed it.

526
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:22,371
So, thanks.
Okay. Thanks for coming.

527
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:23,473
Nice to meet you.
You, too.

528
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,745
And you guys have a
good time together. Okay.

529
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:27,218
Talk to you Monday.
Yeah.

530
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:28,845
Goodbye.
Good night.

531
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:31,722
She's a good boss.

532
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,453
She seems really nice.
Oh, she's great.

533
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:36,461
Love triangle. Drama.

534
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:38,863
All worked out
in the end, though.

535
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:40,763
The hero got the girl.

536
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:42,994
Who saw that coming? I did.

537
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,233
And Jan was really
happy for me.

538
00:26:45,305 --> 00:26:47,068
So, actually,
the hero got two girls.

539
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,607
He got the girl
that he works with

540
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:51,803
and he got the girl
that he buys real estate from.

541
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:57,411
So, I've got my New York girl
and my local flavor.

542
00:26:58,418 --> 00:26:59,749
Life is good.

543
00:27:02,222 --> 00:27:04,053
About 10 minutes ago.

544
00:27:05,492 --> 00:27:07,687
No, I didn't know what to say.

545
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:10,094
Yes, I know.

546
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:15,361
I don't know, Mom,
he's my best friend.

547
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,331
Yeah, he's great.

548
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:23,838
Yeah, I think I am.

549
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:27,703
I have to go. I will.

550
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,940
Listen, Jim...
