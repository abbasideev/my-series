1
00:00:00,184 --> 00:00:02,914
So, Phil recruited me
to sell these cards,

2
00:00:02,987 --> 00:00:04,579
and now I am recruiting you.

3
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:06,486
Who is this guy again?
Don't worry about Phil.

4
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:08,684
He drives a Corvette.
He's doing just fine.

5
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:13,355
Okay. Calling cards
are the wave of the future.

6
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:15,763
These things sell themselves.
Who uses calling cards anymore?

7
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,596
You know what?
That's a nice attitude, Ryan.

8
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:20,262
I'm just helping you invest
in your future, my friend.

9
00:00:20,338 --> 00:00:21,737
It sounds like
a get-rich-quick scheme.

10
00:00:21,806 --> 00:00:25,139
Yes, thank you. You will
get rich quick. We all will.

11
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:27,676
Didn't you lose a lot of money
on that other investment,

12
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:28,837
that one from the e-mail?

13
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:31,507
You know what, Toby? When the
son of the deposed King of Nigeria

14
00:00:31,582 --> 00:00:34,710
e- mails you directly
asking for help, you help.

15
00:00:35,086 --> 00:00:37,953
His father ran
the freaking country, okay?

16
00:00:39,023 --> 00:00:42,754
All right, so raise your hand
if you wanna get rich.

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,422
All right.
No.

18
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:46,725
How is this not
a pyramid scheme?

19
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:48,896
All right,
let me explain, again.

20
00:00:52,203 --> 00:00:54,535
Phil has recruited me
and another guy.

21
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:57,938
Now we are getting
three people each.

22
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:01,467
The more people that get involved,
the more people who are investing,

23
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:04,139
the more money we're all gonna
make. It's not a pyramid scheme.

24
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:07,480
It is a... It's not even
a scheme, per se. It's...

25
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,485
I have to go make a call.

26
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:01,396
Happy birthday, Michael.
What?

27
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:03,197
I said, "Happy birthday. "

28
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:05,606
Thank you.
That's really nice.

29
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:07,143
Today is my B-day.

30
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:10,044
And people around here
just go crazy for it.

31
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:11,376
I don't know why.

32
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:12,643
Oh, fun fact.

33
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,412
I share my birthday
with Eva Longoria.

34
00:02:16,787 --> 00:02:20,951
So, I have a perfect icebreaker
if I ever meet Teri Hatcher.

35
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,853
You excited?

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,559
Everybody freaking out?

37
00:02:24,862 --> 00:02:27,422
Cool. It's gonna be fun. You're
late. Thank you, it's noon.

38
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:31,292
But, I forgive you. Because
doth, it is my birthday.

39
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,804
What's up?
Hi.

40
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:39,074
Oh, happy birthday.
Thank you, sir.

41
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,939
Michael's birthday.

42
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:44,109
It's pretty fun to watch,
actually.

43
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:47,111
He gets very excited and
then he eats a lot of cake.

44
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:49,243
And then he runs
around the office.

45
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,551
And then he has a sugar crash in the
afternoon. And then he falls asleep.

46
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:55,091
And that's when
we get our work done.

47
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,926
Did you hear anything yet?
No.

48
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:05,930
I'm still waiting.

49
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,736
Yeah.
Yes.

50
00:03:09,807 --> 00:03:12,173
There he is, the birthday boy. Oh, God.

51
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:15,041
Birthday hug. No, no,
no, no. New suit. Please.

52
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,580
That suit is amazing.
Thank you very much.

53
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:19,047
It is from Italy.

54
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:22,847
Actually, Bulgaria. So...

55
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,182
Maybe I should get one.

56
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:26,155
Good luck. One-of-a-kind.

57
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,652
EBay.

58
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:31,183
Question: May I be in charge of
the party planning festivities?

59
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:33,787
Not necessary. The Party
Planning Committee is all over it.

60
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:36,094
They've been working 24l7,
all day, yesterday.

61
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:38,727
Excellent. On my part,
I did manage to reserve the...

62
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:42,533
Don't! No. Please. Don't
want to spoil it for anybody.

63
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:43,766
Don't spoil the surprise.

64
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:46,002
Let's get the party started.
Let's get the party started.

65
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:47,566
Not the way I taught you.

66
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:54,349
When should we bring out
the cake, 1:00 or 1:30?

67
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:56,181
1:00 is good.
1:30.

68
00:03:58,956 --> 00:04:01,516
I'm sorry, are we boring you? I...

69
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:03,219
Party Planning Committee,
listen up.

70
00:04:03,294 --> 00:04:06,161
Michael would like trick
candles for his birthday cake,

71
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,458
so make that a priority.

72
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:09,897
Where do we get those?
Not my problem.

73
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:14,131
Here's a list of things that Michael
would like to be surprised by.

74
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:16,569
Michael wants
a stripper gram?

75
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,700
Yes, but he doesn't want
to know when or whom.

76
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:22,405
No.
This is a closed-door meeting.

77
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:34,788
Yeah. Michael, I have Jan on the line.

78
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,985
Oh, great, put her through.
Okay.

79
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,920
Hello, Michael?
Hey, you.

80
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:42,763
I'm returning your call.
You said it was urgent.

81
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,563
It is urgent. I just wanted to
call and wish you a happy birthday.

82
00:04:45,636 --> 00:04:47,729
Well, today's
not my birthday. So...

83
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:49,033
Really?

84
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:51,973
'Cause I thought we had
the same birthday.

85
00:04:53,477 --> 00:04:55,911
Happy birthday, Michael.
Thanks.

86
00:04:56,947 --> 00:04:59,472
Am I on camera?
Nope.

87
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:04,481
Totally private. You can say
whatever is in your heart.

88
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:11,193
You can take a five
if you want.

89
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,405
Somebody brought in donuts
for my birthday.

90
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:34,610
Happy birthday.
Thanks.

91
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:41,723
Man, I'm so sorry.
When do you find out?

92
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:45,023
They said this afternoon. They're
waiting on a second opinion.

93
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,495
Oh, okay.
Second opinion on what?

94
00:05:47,865 --> 00:05:49,958
I might have skin cancer.
Oh, no.

95
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:52,502
I was watching Grey's Anatomy
and there was a lifeguard on it,

96
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,002
and he had skin cancer, too.

97
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:55,265
Kelly, you know what...

98
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:58,467
I never really thought about
death until Princess Diana died.

99
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:01,010
That was the saddest
funeral ever.

100
00:06:02,646 --> 00:06:04,477
That and my sister's.

101
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:08,610
Who brought in donuts? Somebody
got donuts for my birthday.

102
00:06:08,686 --> 00:06:11,382
Happy birthday. You didn't
know it was my birthday?

103
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,888
I guess I forgot.

104
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,857
Well, I guess I forgot
to give you a donut.

105
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,787
Are you serious?

106
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,572
Skin cancer is treatable.
Right.

107
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:31,835
It's gonna be okay.

108
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:35,868
You don't know it's going to be
okay. Don't give him false hope.

109
00:06:38,215 --> 00:06:40,513
It's probably nothing though.

110
00:06:41,452 --> 00:06:43,784
Hi.
Delivery for Michael Scott.

111
00:06:44,388 --> 00:06:45,616
Here we go.

112
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:47,782
Okay, this is great.

113
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:51,090
Thank you, my friends.
She is perfect.

114
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:53,627
Dwight, may I have your chair,
please?

115
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:56,257
And some singles
if you will?

116
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,823
All right.

117
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,096
Okay.

118
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:04,933
All right.

119
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:07,873
This has arms. Is that gonna
be a... Is that all right?

120
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:09,709
Sure.

121
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:11,473
Okay.

122
00:07:12,783 --> 00:07:14,546
I'm so nervous.

123
00:07:16,153 --> 00:07:18,849
I can sign for it.
Oh, thanks.

124
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:22,186
When I was seven,

125
00:07:22,826 --> 00:07:26,660
my mother hired
a pony and a cart

126
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:29,726
to come to my house
for all the kids.

127
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:35,127
And I got a really bad rash
from the pony.

128
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:38,674
And all the kids got to ride
the pony and I had to go inside.

129
00:07:38,742 --> 00:07:43,008
And my mother was rubbing cream
on me for probably three hours

130
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,707
and I never came outside.

131
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:47,342
And by the time I got out, the
pony was already in the truck

132
00:07:47,418 --> 00:07:49,113
and around the corner.

133
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:51,249
So that was my worst birthday.

134
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,227
Stop it! Stop! What is that?

135
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:06,334
It's For The Longest Time
by William Joel. Yeah.

136
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,633
It's your favorite song.
Yeah, when it's on the radio.

137
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:10,502
My birthday blows.

138
00:08:11,308 --> 00:08:13,640
Nobody even signed
my birthday poster.

139
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:18,107
Apparently, my mother is the only one
who cares enough to send me anything.

140
00:08:18,182 --> 00:08:21,743
I probably care more than she
does. You're making it worse.

141
00:08:23,454 --> 00:08:26,218
I bet Luke Perry's friends
don't treat him like this.

142
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:30,349
When does he hear?
Sometime today.

143
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:32,552
Poor Kevin.

144
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:38,798
If I knew I had a week to live,
I would probably go to Europe.

145
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,601
And South America.

146
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:43,663
And the Grand Canyon.

147
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,475
And I would want to see
the Pacific Ocean.

148
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:50,346
It would be
a pretty busy week.

149
00:08:50,714 --> 00:08:53,842
That's a list price
of $4.50.

150
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:58,081
Unfortunately,
this item is on back-order.

151
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:01,351
Michael! Michael!
Michael! Michael! Michael!

152
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:02,551
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

153
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,457
What? What?
Listen up, everyone.

154
00:09:05,262 --> 00:09:07,560
It is 11:23 exactly.

155
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:11,863
The exact moment when you emerged
from your mother's vaginal canal.

156
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,300
So, huh?

157
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,100
Right, have a seat please.
Oh, God.

158
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:18,903
There is a tradition
that the Hebrews have

159
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:22,605
of hoisting the birthday
boy up on a chair. Oh, no.

160
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,840
So come over and help me
celebrate Michael's birth moment.

161
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:27,145
Kevin!
Oh, no, no, no!

162
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:28,616
I'll do it.
Ryan, come on.

163
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:30,016
Creed.
Let's do this.

164
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:31,452
Come on, Stanley,
let's go!

165
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:34,116
I feel like we should go
get Kevin something.

166
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:37,251
Do you think we can
sneak out of here? Maybe,

167
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:41,195
but we're gonna need somebody
to create a diversion and...

168
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:43,290
On three, we're gonna
hoist away. Ready?

169
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:46,734
Okay. Happy birth moment,
Michael. Thank you.

170
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:49,431
One! Two! Three!

171
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,866
Whoa, Whoa! Cut... All right,
all right, watch it please.

172
00:09:52,943 --> 00:09:54,740
Oscar.
It wasn't me.

173
00:09:58,115 --> 00:10:00,982
Okay, that is not
an 8-foot sub.

174
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:04,253
We don't make an 8-foot sub.
This is eight 1-foot subs.

175
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:06,279
F.

176
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:09,214
All right, what's the damage?
$39.60.

177
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,329
$39.

178
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:21,899
Sixty.

179
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:25,099
Why tip someone for a job
I'm capable of doing myself?

180
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:28,106
I can deliver food,
I can drive a taxi,

181
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:30,845
I can and do cut my own hair.

182
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:33,975
I did, however,
tip my urologist.

183
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:38,348
Because I am unable to
pulverize my own kidney stones.

184
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:41,087
Here they come.
Get in here.

185
00:10:41,158 --> 00:10:43,820
Come and get it. Everybody,
birthday party subs.

186
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,191
My gift to you.
What is this?

187
00:10:45,262 --> 00:10:47,457
Baloney, tomato and ketchup.
The best.

188
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:49,192
These are all the same.
Yes.

189
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:51,632
Baloney? I don't eat baloney.

190
00:10:51,702 --> 00:10:54,227
Well, then just have the tomato
and ketchup. It's still good.

191
00:10:54,304 --> 00:10:55,293
No.

192
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:58,341
Just the bread. It's fresh-baked. No.

193
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,202
Okay.

194
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:03,708
Get whatever you want.
And choke on it.

195
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,711
When I was 16,

196
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:09,479
I was supposed
to go out on a date

197
00:11:09,553 --> 00:11:11,521
with a girl named Julie.

198
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,048
But there was another Michael
in the class

199
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,923
that she apparently thought
the date was with.

200
00:11:17,995 --> 00:11:20,862
So she went out with him
on my birthday.

201
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:25,399
And she got him a cake
at the restaurant,

202
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:27,197
and it wasn't
even his birthday.

203
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,205
But I heard about it
the next day in school.

204
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,368
So, that was the worst
birthday I think I ever had.

205
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,775
So, we got Kev some stuff.

206
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:39,777
Party pack of M&M's,
his favorite candy.

207
00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:42,750
A DVD of American Pie 2,
which is his favorite movie.

208
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:44,150
And he lent it to Creed,

209
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:46,553
so I can guarantee you
he won't get that back.

210
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,682
Sixty-nine Cup of Noodles.

211
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:52,252
Which we realize sounds crass,
but it is his favorite number.

212
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:53,660
And his favorite lunch.

213
00:11:57,234 --> 00:12:01,261
Hey, Temp, you know we still
got five feet of sandwich left.

214
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:04,397
Someone ate three feet
of that thing? Hell, yeah.

215
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,341
Save room for ice cream cake. Thank you.

216
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:08,469
Oh, I got it.
Wait.

217
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:10,479
It's the
Party Planning Committee.

218
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:12,981
This is the most
important day of the year.

219
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,950
I can't risk anything.

220
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:17,613
Fine.

221
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:21,024
What about that meeting later

222
00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:23,723
to discuss finances?

223
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:26,122
Yes.

224
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:28,424
But don't expect any cookie.

225
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:31,790
But what if I'm hungry?

226
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:33,794
No cookie.

227
00:12:52,322 --> 00:12:53,346
What?

228
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:55,914
You use fabric softener?
Yeah. You don't?

229
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:57,289
No, I do.

230
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:58,752
Okay.

231
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:02,290
Happy birthday

232
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,766
dear Michael

233
00:13:07,104 --> 00:13:10,870
Happy birthday

234
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:14,468
to you

235
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,512
Hello. Hey.

236
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,682
Kevin, respect
the birthday, please?

237
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,014
No. No, not yet.

238
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:24,283
I will. Goodbye.

239
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:27,488
It was just Daisy.
Are you done?

240
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:28,717
Good.

241
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:32,518
Okay. I'm gonna...
Here we go. Make a wish.

242
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:34,063
...blow out the candles. Okay.

243
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:39,228
Yeah!

244
00:13:42,005 --> 00:13:43,438
I asked for trick candles.

245
00:13:43,507 --> 00:13:45,475
Pam was supposed to get
them. Sorry. Okay. Well,

246
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:48,238
when she comes back
we'll do it again.

247
00:13:49,112 --> 00:13:51,945
Hello? What about
the birthday boy?

248
00:13:52,015 --> 00:13:54,176
Haven't had a hug all day.

249
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:56,751
No one cares
about your birthday.

250
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,846
Kevin's waiting to hear
if he has skin cancer.

251
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:10,262
Oh, that sucks! Great.

252
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:15,829
Wow, that's good timing.

253
00:14:16,406 --> 00:14:17,771
That's...

254
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:20,538
Sorry, that's terrible.
Terrible news.

255
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,205
That's terrible news
for both of us.

256
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:35,950
We should probably head back.
Yeah, okay.

257
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:38,620
Oh, I dare you
to make an announcement.

258
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:40,925
You dare me? How old are you?

259
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:43,094
Just quit stalling.

260
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:48,027
Luke, this is your father.

261
00:14:48,872 --> 00:14:51,705
Come set the table for dinner.

262
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:53,875
Such a dork.

263
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:58,805
Jim Halpert, price check
on fabric softener.

264
00:14:58,882 --> 00:15:00,941
The kind with the cute...
Ma'am, please don't touch that.

265
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:03,178
That is not a toy.
Oh, I'm sorry.

266
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:05,581
Sorry.

267
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,256
How old are you?
I hate you.

268
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,556
Honestly, is there any way you
can get on your fiancee's plan?

269
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:14,688
Our health plan is terrible.

270
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:16,925
Here you are. Good news.
Did some research.

271
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,266
It turns out that 98% of people
with skin cancer fully recover.

272
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:23,003
It's still scary.

273
00:15:23,073 --> 00:15:25,439
Yeah, but it's
not brain cancer,

274
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:28,075
and it shouldn't stop us
from having fun.

275
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:30,135
You know what they say
the best medicine is?

276
00:15:30,213 --> 00:15:34,172
Well the doctor said a combination
of interferon and Dacarbazine.

277
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:36,776
And laughter also.

278
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:40,245
I don't really think people
are in the laughing mood.

279
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:42,458
Why are you here?

280
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,459
I didn't even invite you
to my birthday party.

281
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,791
I work here.
"I work here. "

282
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,559
All right. Well, you know what? Since
Toby doesn't speak for everybody,

283
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:52,898
and I am your boss, I think
you should just go home.

284
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:55,369
Take the rest of the
afternoon off. Take a sick day.

285
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:58,339
If I go home now,
I'll just drive myself crazy.

286
00:15:58,408 --> 00:16:01,275
Well, you're pretty much driving
everybody else here crazy.

287
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:05,974
Crazy with worry.

288
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,201
Where have you been?

289
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:35,335
And don't say the bathroom,
because I kicked in all the stalls.

290
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,381
Well, that's an invasion of
privacy, so I'm gonna tell Michael.

291
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:39,971
Please, don't.

292
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:42,216
You owe me.

293
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:44,219
Excuse me, everyone.

294
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:46,348
Attention, please.

295
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:50,390
Kevin, we're gonna take you
to a very special place,

296
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,928
a place that will
make you happy,

297
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:56,124
and a place that is far,
far away from the evil sun.

298
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:00,460
Is this trip in any way
related to your birthday?

299
00:17:00,804 --> 00:17:03,204
How dare you, sir.
You are gross.

300
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,739
That should not be there.

301
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,142
I'll get someone to take it down.
No, it's all right. It's already up.

302
00:17:09,212 --> 00:17:10,611
Just leave it. Where's Kevin?

303
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,875
Come on, let's get
our skate on!

304
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:17,616
Don't be scared. You're
good. You're good.

305
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:25,451
I wanna go...

306
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:27,594
Think you can let go?
No.

307
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:30,590
Okay.

308
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,396
Yeah!
Who's that?

309
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,936
Was that Michael?

310
00:17:34,404 --> 00:17:36,770
Yeah, I've been pretty much
skating my whole life.

311
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:40,734
I thought about playing in the
NHL, but you're on the road so much.

312
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,470
You get no time to spend
with your wife and kids.

313
00:17:43,747 --> 00:17:45,681
And I really want
a wife and kids.

314
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,549
I got it.

315
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,825
Hey, Pam.
All the stuff with Kevin

316
00:17:57,594 --> 00:17:58,959
is pretty scary.

317
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:01,527
And I'm thinking that next
time you're in the shower,

318
00:18:01,598 --> 00:18:04,624
you should check yourself out.
You know, give yourself an exam.

319
00:18:04,768 --> 00:18:06,998
Those things
are like ticking time-bags.

320
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,361
All right? Think about it.

321
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,075
It's something to think about.

322
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:16,408
I just can't relax about
it, you know? Kevin!

323
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,571
You heard anything yet?
No, not yet.

324
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:21,514
Okay. Well, live strong.

325
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:22,778
Okay, Michael.
All right.

326
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,319
Michael?
Yeah.

327
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:25,877
Carol?
Yeah.

328
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,017
She sold me my condo.

329
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:30,924
Hey, what, is this place
on the market or...

330
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:34,356
No, I don't just
sell real estate.

331
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:36,058
My daughter has
a skating lesson.

332
00:18:36,132 --> 00:18:37,895
Oh, these all your kids?

333
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:39,662
No, just the front two.

334
00:18:39,736 --> 00:18:41,397
Oh. Hey, guys. What's up?

335
00:18:41,471 --> 00:18:43,530
You wanna go for a ride?
Is that okay?

336
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:45,597
Sure.
Cool. All right, grab on.

337
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:48,769
Here we go. You ready?
Hang on tight.

338
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:51,304
All right.
We are moving.

339
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:54,282
We are really moving now!

340
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:01,957
Push. Good,
that's great. You got it.

341
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,056
Excuse me.

342
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:07,524
Hello?

343
00:19:08,665 --> 00:19:10,030
Yeah, okay.

344
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:12,729
All right.

345
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,129
Okay, I will. Thanks.

346
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:19,698
It's negative.

347
00:19:21,711 --> 00:19:22,871
Oh, God!

348
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,846
We're gonna beat this, okay?
We're gonna...

349
00:19:32,288 --> 00:19:33,516
Come here.

350
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:38,326
Well, apparently,
in the medicine community,

351
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:39,884
"negative" means "good,"

352
00:19:40,363 --> 00:19:42,126
which makes
absolutely no sense.

353
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:44,826
In the real world community

354
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:47,735
that would be chaos.

355
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:51,139
This is awesome.

356
00:19:52,142 --> 00:19:53,734
Thanks, you guys.

357
00:19:54,577 --> 00:19:56,442
Okay, who is this from?

358
00:19:58,748 --> 00:20:02,878
Wowee, look at that jersey!

359
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,681
Turn it around. Turn it around. Cool.

360
00:20:04,754 --> 00:20:05,914
Show it.

361
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:07,612
Great.

362
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:11,251
"From Dwight. Number One. " Thank
you, Dwight. That's great. Thanks.

363
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:12,316
Michael.
Yeah.

364
00:20:12,395 --> 00:20:15,853
This is from all of us. Oh,
you didn't need to do that.

365
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:19,932
Night Swept.

366
00:20:20,103 --> 00:20:23,072
This is really amazing.
Thank you.

367
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,871
I love it.

368
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:27,932
Michael's birthday
was actually pretty cool.

369
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:30,278
It was a good day.

370
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,171
I don't know.

371
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:34,244
It was a good day.
