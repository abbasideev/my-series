2x01 : The Dundies
by Belkiss, Occeanne et Unfold
http://pmag.f2o.org/theofficeus/

2
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:36,822
Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee
world's night here at Dunder Mifflin

3
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:42,280
and this is everybody's favorite day,
everybody looks forward to it.

4
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:47,293
Because, you know a lot of the people
here don't get trophies very often

5
00:00:47,344 --> 00:00:51,024
like Meredith or Kevin. I mean, who's gonna
give Kevin an award ? Dunkin Donuts ?

6
00:00:51,075 --> 00:00:53,853
Plus, bonus, it's really really funny.

7
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:57,470
So I..., you know an employee will go
home, and he'll tell his neighbor :

8
00:00:57,477 --> 00:01:00,044
"Hey, did you get an award ?"
And the neighbor will say :

9
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:03,813
"No man, I mean I slave all day,
nobody notices me."

10
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:09,040
Next thing you know, employee smells something
terrible coming from the neighbor’s house :

11
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:13,186
Neighbor’s hanged himself,
due to lack of recognition.

12
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:18,590
So you're ready for the Dundies ?

13
00:01:18,675 --> 00:01:22,903
You know what they say about a car wreck
where it's so awful you can't look away ?

14
00:01:23,255 --> 00:01:26,892
The Dundies are like a car wreck that
you want to look away

15
00:01:27,263 --> 00:01:30,919
but you have to stare at it
because your boss is making you.

16
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:36,241
It's fat Halpert

17
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:41,671
- What ?
- Fat Halpert, Jim Halpert.

18
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:47,410
So why don't I take you on a
tour of past Dundee winners ?

19
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:52,921
We got fat Jim Halpert here, Jim why don't
you show off your Dundies to the camera ?

20
00:01:52,976 --> 00:01:57,002
Oh I can't, because I keep them hidden,
I don't wanna look at them and get cocky.

21
00:01:57,005 --> 00:02:01,702
- Oh, that's a good idea.
- And mine are at home,
in a display case about my bed.

22
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:04,301
TMI, TMI my friend.

23
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,722
TMI ? Too Much Information.

24
00:02:07,907 --> 00:02:11,623
It's just easier to say TMI. I used to
say "Don't Go There" but that's lame.

25
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:16,593
And here we have Stanley the manly, now
Stanley is a Dundee Allstar, aren’t you
Stan ?

26
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:19,132
Why don't you show them some of your bling ?

27
00:02:19,225 --> 00:02:21,431
I don't know where they are,
I think I threw them out.

28
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:25,683
- Oh, no you didn't.
- I think I did.

29
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:27,690
Why did...?

30
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:30,562
Say, we gotta order some
more appetizers this time.

31
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:33,463
- We ran out last year, remember ?
- Yes we should, you know what ?

32
00:02:33,478 --> 00:02:36,243
I wanted one of those skillets of cheese,

33
00:02:36,308 --> 00:02:41,962
but when I got on stage,
someone had eaten all of them.

34
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:46,553
<i>To Oscar Martinez,
It's the "Show Me The Money" award !</i>

35
00:02:46,575 --> 00:02:50,741
Michael has taped every Dundies Awards,

36
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:55,891
and now he's making me look through
hours of footage to find highlights.

37
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:58,661
<i>That's the type of song
we're gonna play to the ladies,
Hit it Dwight !</i>

38
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:08,140
<i>A little bit of Pam, all night long.
A little bit of Angela, on the sing.</i>

39
00:03:08,195 --> 00:03:09,900
<i>A little bit of...</i>

40
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:14,493
This is the part where Kevin stands in front
of the camcorder all night. It's great.

41
00:03:21,705 --> 00:03:24,050
- It was you.
- It wasn't me, I swear.

42
00:03:24,196 --> 00:03:27,303
So what's the joke ?
You're not perfect either !

43
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:30,732
- We're not laughing at you Dwight !
- So who are you laughing at ?

44
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:34,960
- Just something somebody wrote.
- Who ? Dave Barry ?

45
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:38,870
No, no. That was just something that
was written on the ladies room wall.

46
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:40,353
What is it ? Who wrote it ?

47
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:44,662
- It's kind of private,
- It's about Michael !

48
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:48,272
That is defacement of company
property, so you'd better tell me.

49
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:51,162
Kelly, if you tell me,
you'll be punished less.

50
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,341
- Ok, now I'm laughing at you !

51
00:03:56,055 --> 00:04:00,113
Will her highness Jan Levinson Gould be

52
00:04:00,177 --> 00:04:04,813
descending from her corporate throne
this evening to visit us lowly serfs here,

53
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:06,271
Dunder Mifflin Scranton ?

54
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:09,733
<i>- It's a two and a half hour drive
from New York Michael.</i>

55
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:13,620
- Well, you could take the bus, you could
work on the way here, sleep on the way home.

56
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,591
<i>- No.</i>

57
00:04:14,648 --> 00:04:17,461
Come on Jan this is important, I mean,

58
00:04:17,485 --> 00:04:22,021
this is validation to my employees here
that you and corporate approved of this.

59
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,270
<i>We don't approve of this Michael.</i>

60
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:28,552
<i>You only have the budget for
one office party a year so,</i>

61
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,663
<i>we're not paying for this.</i>

62
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,931
<i>- Are you here ?</i>
- Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to

63
00:04:38,098 --> 00:04:40,681
talk to you for a second about that.

64
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:47,362
What..., what is..., I mean, come on Jan !
You're dropping a A-bomb on me here !

65
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:52,608
<i>- Really ? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you.</i>
- Well, yeah, what is... no you can't !

66
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:54,197
<i>- You already had a party
on May 5th for no reasons ?</i>

67
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:57,881
No reasons ? It was the 05-05-05 party !

68
00:04:57,888 --> 00:05:00,830
<i>- And you also had a...</i>
- It happens once every billion years !

69
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,382
<i>- And the tsunami relief fund raiser
with somehow lost a lot of money</i>

70
00:05:04,408 --> 00:05:10,223
Ok, no that was a fun raiser, I think I made
that very clear on the flyers. Fun, F-U-N.

71
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:12,590
<i>... don't have a tsunami Fun raiser, Michael.
- Well...</i>

72
00:05:12,656 --> 00:05:16,350
I think a lot of people were
very affected by the footage.

73
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:23,160
It's a little character I like to do.
It is loosely based on Karnack,

74
00:05:23,276 --> 00:05:26,542
one  of Carson's classic characters.

75
00:05:27,863 --> 00:05:34,062
We got... the PLO, the IRA and the
hot-dogs stand behind the warehouse.

76
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:44,493
Name 3 businesses that have better
healthcare plans than Dunder Mifflin.

77
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:50,440
Here's the problem : There is
no open bar because of Jan,

78
00:05:50,748 --> 00:05:56,500
and it's the reason why comedy
clubs have a 2-drink minimum.

79
00:05:57,475 --> 00:06:03,451
We'll be fine. I just wish
people gonna be drunk.

80
00:06:15,147 --> 00:06:18,360
- Dwight get out of here what are
you doing into ladies room...?
- No no no, it's not what you're...

81
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:20,760
- Why were you in there ?
- You are a pervert !
- What were you doing in there ?

82
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:21,693
- You are a pervert !
- I am not !

83
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:29,910
<i>The Dundee award, for longest engagement,
goes to Pam Beesly, Pam everybody !</i>

84
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:34,790
<i>When will that girl gonna be
married ? That’s what I have to say</i>

85
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:36,030
<i>- Oh Roy's accepting ?
- Yes.</i>

86
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:39,133
<i>Thank you, you have any words you'd
like to say, at Pam's behalf ?</i>

87
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:44,411
<i>- We'll see you next year !
- Yeah ! Oh nuts ! Oh gosh !</i>

88
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:48,563
- I'm not changing that, that's the best one.
- No it's hilarious, you're right.

89
00:06:48,606 --> 00:06:54,023
I just think, world's on disengagement,
we're all expecting it you know ?

90
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:59,412
That's why it's funny, every year that Roy
and Pam don't get married it gets funnier !

91
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:03,622
Well I think if you use the same jokes
it just comes across as lazy.

92
00:07:04,498 --> 00:07:06,703
- Ow, lazy !

93
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:11,851
Excuse me, everyone, can I
have your attention please ?

94
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:15,871
I just wanted to say that the
women in this office are terrible.

95
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:20,410
Especially the ones who wrote that stuff
about Michael on the bathroom wall.

96
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:25,130
Having a bathroom is a privilege,
it is called a ladies-room for a reason,

97
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:30,870
and if you cannot behave like ladies, well
then you are not going to have a bathroom.

98
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:35,342
- You're taking away our bathroom ?
- We are going to have 2 men rooms.

99
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:40,360
- But where would we go ?
- Be prepared to hold it folks, from 9 AM...

100
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:41,491
- Michael ?
- Yes ?

101
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:43,813
Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.

102
00:07:43,816 --> 00:07:47,170
- Ok, well that's ridiculous, just don't...
I don't have time for this right now.

103
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:52,785
- There needs to be repercussions
to people's behavior...
- Don't don't talk don't touch stop it oddment !

104
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:57,293
- Ok, look I know there have been a lot of rumors
flying around about the Dundies this year,

105
00:07:57,307 --> 00:08:03,463
how there is no money, and how there is
no food, and how the jokes are really bad.

106
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:06,312
But what the hell everybody ?

107
00:08:06,408 --> 00:08:13,373
I mean, god the Dundies are about
the best, in every one of us.

108
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:15,701
Can't you see that ? I mean...

109
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:22,670
ok, we can do better, so,
tonight, for the first time,

110
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:28,972
We  are inviting all of your friends and
family to attend the awards with us.

111
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:31,050
- Yes !
- Yeah, not bad right ?

112
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:33,243
So let's make this best Dundies ever !

113
00:08:35,037 --> 00:08:36,252
Best Dundies ever !

114
00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:48,060
Welcome to eighth annual Dundies awards !
Before we get started, a few announcements :

115
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,433
Keep your acceptance speeches shorts,

116
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:54,969
I have wrap it up music and I'm
not afraid to use it, Devin.

117
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:08,821
<i>The Dundies, how can I explain it ?
A word to auto mated,</i>

118
00:09:08,886 --> 00:09:11,610
<i>You've all made it
You had a was, you work so hard</i>

119
00:09:11,637 --> 00:09:13,450
<i>You fell a no, no
This isn't just a name</i>

120
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,260
<i> And now the N-O
And he's been says Hello</i>

121
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:17,703
<i>Cut, come on !</i>

122
00:09:17,878 --> 00:09:22,491
The Dundies are kind of like a kid's
birthday party, and you go,

123
00:09:22,725 --> 00:09:27,823
and there's really nothing for you to do there,
but the kid's having a really good time, so,

124
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:31,503
you're kind of there.
That's kind of what it's like.

125
00:09:31,748 --> 00:09:35,260
<i>... Dundee, you wanted that Dundee...</i>

126
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:41,292
- The waitress tripped on the cord.
- All right, joke'o'landed, so we are here,

127
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:46,211
Thank you all for coming,
to the 2005 Dundee Awards,

128
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:51,153
I am your host, Michael Scott,
and I just want to tell you

129
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:57,672
please, please, do not drink and drive, because
you may hit a bump, and spill the drink.

130
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:00,623
All the flotties on the group tab.

131
00:10:00,696 --> 00:10:05,150
No, actually this year no group tab
we're gonna be doing separate checks !

132
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:13,790
- You said we could bring our families.
- I did, and why didn't you Stanley ?

133
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:18,652
- I did, my wife's name is Terry.
- Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Terry.

134
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:22,001
It's this person whose hand
I'm holding Michael.

135
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:26,080
<i>Oh yeah !
- Shut it !</i>

136
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:31,492
Good,  speaking of relationships,
of all way shapes and forms,

137
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:37,429
I was out on a very very hot date
last night with a girl from HR Dwight.

138
00:10:37,558 --> 00:10:43,243
- Really ? We don't have any girls from HR.
- Know that, for the sake of the story.

139
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:47,667
And things were getting hot and heavy, - Yeah
- and I was about to take her bra off,

140
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:48,183
<i>Yeah ! </i>

141
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:50,963
When she had me fill out
six hours worth of paper work.

142
00:10:51,037 --> 00:10:55,320
- Like an AIDS test ?
- No... god.

143
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:01,146
- All right. So let's get this party started !
- Hey let's go to Poor Richard's.

144
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:07,330
- Yeah, let's get out of here.
- Guys, where are you going ?

145
00:11:07,426 --> 00:11:11,436
- Just... Pam shows is getting started.
- Sorry.

146
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:15,009
- And now

147
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:18,960
- You're staying ?
- Yeah. I have to eat somewhere.

148
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:29,773
- The Busiest Beaver award goes to Phyllis Lapin !
Way to go Phyllis ! Nice work ! Per usual !

149
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:34,782
- This says bushiest beaver.
- What ? I told them busiest... idiots !

150
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:37,510
- It's fine,
- Well we can fix it, we'll fix it up !

151
00:11:37,586 --> 00:11:38,671
You don't have to display that.

152
00:11:38,706 --> 00:11:41,480
- Because that's what happen every time !
- He's a jackass, every year !

153
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:44,791
- Come on, we're going to Poor Richard's.
- No, I don't want go I don't want to !

154
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:45,313
Pam !

155
00:11:45,315 --> 00:11:47,603
If you would have asked me
that then you would know !

156
00:11:48,268 --> 00:11:50,182
Herro everybodeeee.

157
00:11:51,686 --> 00:11:55,113
Hey ! How are you ? I thought you'd left.

158
00:11:55,116 --> 00:11:59,071
No, I decided to stay. I'll just
get a ride home from Angela.

159
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:03,340
<i>Jan Levinson Gould !</i>

160
00:12:03,376 --> 00:12:05,582
- Good I'm just in time for Ping !
- Yeah

161
00:12:10,137 --> 00:12:11,821
You know what I'm talking about !

162
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:12,913
Can I get a drink ?

163
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:21,511
This next award goes to somebody
who really lights up the office.

164
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:27,070
Somebody who I think a lot of
us cannot keep from checking out.

165
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:31,370
The hottest, in the office award goes to...

166
00:12:31,878 --> 00:12:34,402
Ryan the temp !

167
00:12:41,335 --> 00:12:42,421
Here you go !

168
00:12:51,756 --> 00:12:54,722
What am I going to do with the award ?

169
00:12:56,406 --> 00:13:00,033
Nothing, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

170
00:13:00,657 --> 00:13:03,481
That's the least of my concerns right now.

171
00:13:03,707 --> 00:13:08,572
And the Tight Ass award goes to Angela,

172
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:14,923
not only because she is everybody's favorite
stickler, but because she has a great caboose !

173
00:13:16,577 --> 00:13:20,463
- So come on down !
- No.

174
00:13:27,526 --> 00:13:29,610
I think those might be empty.

175
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:33,223
No, no ‘cause the ice melts,
and then it's like second drink !

176
00:13:34,426 --> 00:13:35,790
Second drink ?

177
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:41,453
The spicy curry award goes to our
very own Kelly Kapoor !

178
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,150
Get on up here !

179
00:13:44,108 --> 00:13:45,200
There you go !

180
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:47,781
- Spicy curry, what's that mean ?

181
00:13:47,857 --> 00:13:49,851
- Not everything means something,
this is a joke.

182
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:52,771
- Yeah, but why did you give it to me ?
- I don't know, I'd just...

183
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:55,893
- This is a bowler !
- I know ! They didn't have
any businessmen so...

184
00:13:56,026 --> 00:13:58,311
- Yeah but everyone else...
- Just sit down Kelly.

185
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:04,000
It's so freakin' hot in there.

186
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:07,553
now I know what Bob Hope was going
through when he performed in Saudi Arabia

187
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:11,013
I got Dwight, sucking the
funny out of room, but,

188
00:14:11,035 --> 00:14:14,990
you know, you do what you can do...
here we go, he's early with the cue !

189
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:16,441
Got to go !

190
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:20,460
("Tiny Dancer"- Elton John) 
- "You have won a tiny Dundie."

191
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:25,440
- Sing it Elton !
- Hey thanks guys !

192
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,512
- Hey where you guys from ?
- We has came from your mama's house.

193
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,791
Hey guys can I finish that ?

194
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:33,293
Sing on a song dude !

195
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:37,221
You know what guys we're just having
a little office party so if you wanna...

196
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:44,930
- Hey ! You know cool it guys !
- You suck man ! You suck !

197
00:14:48,245 --> 00:14:51,230
Let's cut it !

198
00:14:53,886 --> 00:15:01,022
I've a few more Dundies to give out tonight,
but I'm just gonna cut it short, and rapid up.

199
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:04,241
So everybody can enjoy their food.

200
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,780
Thanks for listening,
those of you who listened.

201
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:10,001
This last Dundee is for Kevin,

202
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:13,640
this is the "don't go in there after me"
award, it's for the time that

203
00:15:13,776 --> 00:15:19,462
I went to the bathroom after him and
it was really, really smelly, so.

204
00:15:22,325 --> 00:15:23,421
Here you go.

205
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:36,670
Yeah Kevin, for Kevin,
for stinking up the bathroom !

206
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:43,591
- Hey I haven't gotten one yet !
- Yes, I have not gotten one either !

207
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:45,813
So keep going !
- More Dundies !

208
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:51,170
Dundies ! - Dundies !

209
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:54,472
All right, we'll keep 'em rolling.

210
00:15:54,477 --> 00:16:00,381
This is the fine work award, this goes to
Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year.

211
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,363
You know you did !

212
00:16:04,307 --> 00:16:07,213
Speech-speech-speech-speech

213
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:12,502
Well, last year I got great
work, so I don't know...

214
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:15,292
I don't know what to think about this award,

215
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:19,751
but at least I didn't get smelliest
bowel movement like Kevin !

216
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:27,221
And this next award is going
out to our own little Pam Beesly,

217
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:30,541
I think we all know what award
Pam is gonna be getting this year,

218
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:37,511
It is the whitest sneakers award, because
she always has the whitest tennis shoes on !

219
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:43,980
Get on down here ! Pam Beesly
ladies and gentlemen ! Here we go !

220
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:49,950
I have so many people
to thank for this award !

221
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:57,802
Ok, first off, my Keds, because I couldn't
have done it without them, thank you.

222
00:16:57,948 --> 00:17:04,302
Let's give Michael a round of applause for
MC-ing tonight because this is a lot harder than it looks,

223
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:07,722
and also because of Dwight too.

224
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:12,750
Finally I want to thank God,

225
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:16,700
because God gave me this Dundee,

226
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:20,772
and I feel God in this Chili's tonight.

227
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:27,960
Pam Beesly ladies and
gentlemen ! Ow, thank you !

228
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,742
What a great year for the Dundies !

229
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:47,173
We got to see Ping, and we learned Michael's
true feelings for Ryan, which was touching.

230
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:52,931
And we heard Michael change the lyrics to a
number of classic songs, which for me,

231
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,082
has ruined them for life !

232
00:17:57,018 --> 00:17:59,122
- What ?
- Nothing.

233
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:02,710
-  Okay.
- What ?

234
00:18:02,778 --> 00:18:04,742
I don't know, what ?

235
00:18:05,455 --> 00:18:10,960
Oh my god ! You are so
drunk ! Did you get that ?

236
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:13,861
Please tell me that you got,
this is all gonna be on.

237
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:17,602
- It's ok I'm a sheriff's deputy.
- Well, he's volunteer !

238
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:18,792
Don't get into that now.

239
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:22,323
We need something
to caution her head, throw a pillow, a cush ?

240
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:23,620
- Dwight come on !
- I'm gonna use my shirt.

241
00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:25,332
- Get off of me !
- No !

242
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:28,931
- I'm sorry, sir, you gotta have to put
your clothes back. We're trying to eat...

243
00:18:28,946 --> 00:18:31,962
Was this year's Dundies a
success ? Well, let me see :

244
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:35,872
I made Pam laugh so hard that she fell out
of her chair and she almost broke her neck.

245
00:18:36,138 --> 00:18:38,470
So I killed, almost !

246
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:44,800
Oh my god ! I just wanna say that
this was the best Dundies ever !

247
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:51,141
We have a strict policy here, not oversunk.

248
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:55,120
Apparently this young woman was
sneaking drinks off other people's tables.

249
00:18:55,177 --> 00:19:00,571
Eyes at her officer driver's license and she is
not welcome at this restaurant chains ever again !

250
00:19:01,576 --> 00:19:03,180
- Great work tonight !
- Watch your step !

251
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:04,192
Excellent.

252
00:19:04,238 --> 00:19:08,853
Thanks, I do check her pupils to
make sure that wasn't a concoction.

253
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:13,513
Yes that too but I mean
with the audio, great work !

254
00:19:16,495 --> 00:19:19,790
I feel bad about what I wrote
on the bathroom wall.

255
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,271
No you don't.

256
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:32,242
Oh, here she is. Careful.
All right, easy. Almost there.

257
00:19:32,377 --> 00:19:39,103
- Hey hum, can I ask you a question ?
- Shoot.

258
00:19:45,845 --> 00:19:50,503
- I just wanted to say thanks.
- That's not really a question.

259
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:53,190
Ok let's get you home, come.

260
00:19:57,858 --> 00:20:00,273
- Good bye.
- Good night, have a good night.

261
00:20:00,385 --> 00:20:01,742
Thank you Angela !
