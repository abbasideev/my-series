1
00:00:00,618 --> 00:00:02,017
Let's think this through.

2
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:06,022
If we ask corporate
for that, then...

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,925
They are either
gonna say yes or no.

4
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:15,156
Could go either way. We don't
know what they are going to say.

5
00:00:15,232 --> 00:00:17,393
Think it through! We
have to think it through!

6
00:00:17,468 --> 00:00:20,335
Because,
if they say no...

7
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:25,236
Can we not? No... Yes,
we have to. You know why?

8
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:27,243
'Cause I don't like to be
cooped up in that office.

9
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:30,144
In that box,
all day long. Heisman!

10
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:33,980
Because I need to think,
okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin!

11
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:35,040
Ooh!

12
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:40,315
Nice catch.

13
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:44,620
Oscar! Intercepted.

14
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:46,185
Right here. Give it to
me. Sorry about that.

15
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:48,595
Phyllis, give me the ball. Okay,
give me the ball. Give me...

16
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:49,758
You guys...
Oh, cool.

17
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:51,927
Creed, give me the ball,
right now. Give it to me. Ryan.

18
00:00:54,038 --> 00:00:55,335
Fumble!

19
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,206
Listen...

20
00:00:59,343 --> 00:01:01,072
All right,
hey, Dwight...

21
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,211
Whoa!

22
00:01:04,748 --> 00:01:05,976
Hike.

23
00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:11,387
You all right, Ryan?
Ryan?

24
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:12,513
Yeah.

25
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:15,951
Pam!

26
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:52,193
Oh, they're having
a sale on TiVo.

27
00:01:53,164 --> 00:01:55,257
Maybe I should
get a TiVo.

28
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:59,362
DVD burner. Maybe I
should get one of those.

29
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:02,671
You are so lucky, Jim.

30
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,732
You're so lucky you
don't have this problem.

31
00:02:06,177 --> 00:02:10,375
What was the ninth-place
prize again? A loaf of bread?

32
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:13,007
A Cugino's Pizza.

33
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,881
Oh, great.
Tasty, terrific pizza.

34
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:20,553
Question: Do their pizzas
play DVDs?

35
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:25,853
Dwight was the top salesman
of the year at our company.

36
00:02:25,996 --> 00:02:29,557
He wins a little prize money and
gets honored at some convention.

37
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:33,731
It is literally
the highest possible honor

38
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:36,602
that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-based
mid-sized paper company

39
00:02:36,674 --> 00:02:39,108
regional salesman
can attain. So...

40
00:02:40,978 --> 00:02:42,570
What did I do
to deserve this?

41
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:44,580
Are you sad that Dwight beat you? No.

42
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:46,980
Are you gonna cry, Jim?
Do you need a tissue?

43
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:49,986
Hey. I heard you got a wedding
dress. Do you have pictures?

44
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:51,248
Oh, I... Yeah.

45
00:02:51,322 --> 00:02:53,119
I'll show them
to you later.

46
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,221
Oh, I should get back.

47
00:02:56,493 --> 00:02:58,222
Talk to you guys later.
Okay, cool.

48
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:00,058
I have a ton of stuff
to do for the wedding.

49
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,995
And I have to do it
in the office.

50
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:04,261
And that can be
kind of awkward.

51
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:08,931
Just because people can get
all weird about wedding stuff

52
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:11,736
and I just...
I don't want to offend

53
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:15,042
Angela or someone.

54
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:21,312
That's what she said.

55
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:23,410
I don't get it.

56
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:25,413
Grapes, seductive.

57
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,685
So, you ready for the
big speech this afternoon?

58
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,592
Well, it's not really a big
speech. You're still coming, right?

59
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:34,222
Oh, abso-fruitly.

60
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,858
Fruit, grapes. Nailed
the joke. Matter of time.

61
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:39,767
And yes, it is a big
speech. Biggest of your life.

62
00:03:41,772 --> 00:03:45,105
Speaker at the sales convention.
Been there, done that.

63
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:48,167
Went there again, did it
again. Two years in a row.

64
00:03:49,246 --> 00:03:50,543
Consecutive.

65
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:56,010
I just... I miss the feeling of
knowing that you did a good job

66
00:03:56,086 --> 00:03:57,883
because somebody gives you
proof of it.

67
00:03:57,955 --> 00:04:01,288
"Sir, you're awesome.
Here's a plaque.

68
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,594
"What, a whole year has gone
by and you need more proof?

69
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:05,890
"Here's a certificate. "

70
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,394
They stopped
making plaques that year.

71
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,729
What if I give a really long,
extended thank you, for instance,

72
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:17,536
"Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank
you very, very, very... "

73
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:20,099
That would look terrible.
These are mostly salesmen,

74
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,738
and salesmen expect to be
entertained and you are the main act.

75
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:27,875
When I was in the sixth grade, I was
a finalist in our school spelling bee.

76
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:29,919
It was me
against Raj Patel.

77
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:33,819
And I misspelled
in front of the entire school

78
00:04:34,992 --> 00:04:36,459
the word "failure. "

79
00:04:37,227 --> 00:04:38,558
I can't do this.

80
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:41,996
That's because you're incapable of
doing it, because you don't know how,

81
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,863
because you have no skills.

82
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:47,569
Dwight, there's no way
I can possibly teach you

83
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:50,198
what you need to know about
public speaking by speech time.

84
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:51,832
Oh, okay.

85
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:55,242
But I can teach you enough so that
you don't embarrass me or the company.

86
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:58,110
Okay, deal. I'll do whatever
you say, no questions asked.

87
00:04:58,182 --> 00:05:00,013
Well, if you have a
question, you should ask me.

88
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:01,415
I'll try and think
of one. When...

89
00:05:01,485 --> 00:05:02,611
Don't try to think
of a question to humor me.

90
00:05:02,686 --> 00:05:05,120
Just try not to be
such an idiot.

91
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:08,750
Is that an insult, or is that
part of the public speaking advice?

92
00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:11,521
Insult.

93
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,092
Mom, I'm sorry,
I know you and Dad

94
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:16,132
are chipping in
for the wedding

95
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,464
but I do not
want orange invitations.

96
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:24,096
Yes. Well, if you really
want my opinion...

97
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:26,534
Hi, yeah, can I talk to
one of your travel agents?

98
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,202
I'm gonna take a trip.

99
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:32,440
I'm gonna get out of town
for a while, and go someplace

100
00:05:33,884 --> 00:05:35,374
not here.

101
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:37,478
Where do I want to go?

102
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:40,690
That is an excellent question.

103
00:05:41,024 --> 00:05:44,790
And one I probably should have
thought about before I called you.

104
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:49,723
I get here early every morning
so I can set the thermostat.

105
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,896
I like it a little cooler, around
66 degrees. I'm more productive.

106
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:57,236
Maybe some people
don't like it as cold as I do.

107
00:05:58,075 --> 00:05:59,167
But I don't care.

108
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,640
But seriously, what's the difference
between a salesman and a saleswoman?

109
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:04,976
A saleswoman has a vagina.

110
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:06,777
It's a joke, Dwight,
it's not a sex ed class.

111
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,942
But I'm right.

112
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:10,509
Yeah, you're right about the
difference between a man and a woman,

113
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:12,578
but not about the punch line
to the joke. All right?

114
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:16,820
The difference between a salesman
and a saleswoman is boobs.

115
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:19,658
Hey, do you remember
the speeches that you gave?

116
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,061
I do, both of them.

117
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,691
Could I have a copy of one of
them? No, no, they would remember.

118
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:25,928
Look, it doesn't matter
what you say,

119
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:29,029
it just matters that you're saying
something that people care about.

120
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:32,007
You know? All right,
here we go. Watch this.

121
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:34,543
Attention, everybody!
Attention, please!

122
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:38,741
I have some very great news from
corporate. We had a wonderful quarter.

123
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:43,082
And as a result, all of you
are getting bonuses for $1,000.

124
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,678
Yeah!
Congratulations.

125
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:50,026
Unbelievable.
It's great.

126
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,185
Wow.

127
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,857
You see that? You see
how they responded to me?

128
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:55,956
That's amazing. In
that moment, I had them.

129
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:59,298
That is so great about the
bonus. No, no, it's not true.

130
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:02,998
I was just talking. So just
go out there and say anything.

131
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,635
They'll eat it up,
they're a great audience.

132
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:09,270
Go ahead, get the wallpaper.
Wallpaper the ceiling if you want...

133
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,804
Excuse me! May I have
your attention, please?

134
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:16,319
There has been an accident
on 84 West.

135
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:19,378
Cars have skidded off the road
into the safety railing.

136
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:21,185
Several cars have flipped,

137
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:25,058
there is broken glass everywhere,
several people are injured.

138
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,830
Do we know anyone
who was in the accident?

139
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,130
Brad Pitt.

140
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:33,965
Also, there will be
no bonuses.

141
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,835
Why would this affect our
bonuses? They're unrelated.

142
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:38,101
Is Brad okay?

143
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:40,006
He will never act again.

144
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,271
Also, this branch is closing.

145
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:44,610
What the hell's going on
here? Are we out of jobs?

146
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:46,308
Yes.
This is karma

147
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,112
because of what he did
to Jennifer Aniston.

148
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:50,619
He was kidding! Dwight was
kidding and I don't know why

149
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:54,316
because it wasn't funny
and it was just horrible...

150
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:56,253
Michael?
Yeah?

151
00:07:56,326 --> 00:07:57,725
You said we were
getting bonuses.

152
00:07:57,794 --> 00:08:01,491
All right, everybody in the conference
room now. Let's go. Let's do it!

153
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:02,725
Cancel the wallpaper.

154
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,597
As your leader and your
friend, I sort of demand

155
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,662
that you can all speak
in public as I can,

156
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,767
and did, twice.
You saw the plaque, right?

157
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:16,378
All right, we're all
gonna go around the room,

158
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:17,811
and we're going to
make toasts.

159
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:21,408
And that way, we will overcome
our fear of public speaking.

160
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:22,975
You mean toastmasters?
Pam!

161
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:25,954
I'm public speaking,
stop public interrupting me!

162
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:29,823
Actually, this would be good
practice for your wedding toast.

163
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:32,961
Yeah, the bride
doesn't really do...

164
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,021
Have you ever
been to a wedding?

165
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:38,664
Can I go? Yes, good. Jim
taking the initiative.

166
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:43,703
So, I am going on a trip.

167
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:47,304
But I'm not really sure where I'm
going yet. It's kind of open-ended.

168
00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:50,403
So, I was hoping maybe you guys
would have some suggestions.

169
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,141
You should go to Hedonism.

170
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:53,682
What is that?

171
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,481
It's like Club Med,
but everything is naked.

172
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:01,891
I was thinking more like
Europe or something like that,

173
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,449
but good second choice.

174
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:04,824
I've been to Amsterdam.

175
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:09,059
Oh, okay, you know what? That's
not a toast, you're not standing up.

176
00:09:11,335 --> 00:09:13,997
To Amsterdam.
When did you go there?

177
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:16,963
After my divorce.
Really?

178
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,405
Yeah. For, like, how long?

179
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:22,104
About a week, or maybe
a month. I can't...

180
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:26,172
Jimmy, listen to me, you do not
wanna go to Amsterdam, trust me.

181
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:29,343
Where do I wanna go?
I'd send you to Hong Kong.

182
00:09:29,553 --> 00:09:31,418
I'd like to say hi
to my friends in China.

183
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,357
Okay. Dwight,

184
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,590
show us what
you have learned today.

185
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:48,830
Good morning, Vietnam!

186
00:09:48,905 --> 00:09:50,532
Oh, God.

187
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:59,272
Okay, you know what,
this isn't working,

188
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:03,342
because I'm not nervous in front
of them. They're my subordinates.

189
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,910
No, we're not.

190
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:08,084
Yes, you are. I'm
assistant regional manager.

191
00:10:08,158 --> 00:10:09,648
Which means
absolutely nothing.

192
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:11,125
Michael, can you explain?

193
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,992
Well, it's mostly made up.
So...

194
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:16,690
Dwight is not going to
do a good job. It's sad.

195
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:19,361
And they're expecting excellence,
because I did do such a good job.

196
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:21,666
Two years in a row,
I killed. It was amazing.

197
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:25,302
Confidence, Dwight!

198
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:31,439
Dwight.

199
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:34,182
If you could travel anywhere in
the world, where would you go?

200
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:36,116
I can travel anywhere
except Cuba,

201
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:38,553
and I will travel
to New Zealand

202
00:10:38,622 --> 00:10:40,556
and walk The Lord of the
Rings trail to Mordor,

203
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:42,319
and then I will
hike Mount Doom.

204
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:44,486
So now,
just leave me alone.

205
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,689
Okay. I was just trying
to get some advice on my trip.

206
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:49,460
Oh, please.
You're not taking any trip.

207
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:57,733
You know, I majored in
Public Speaking in college.

208
00:10:57,808 --> 00:10:59,173
You did?
Mmm-hmm.

209
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,071
And the first thing that
they teach you is that

210
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:03,773
you've gotta be true
to yourself.

211
00:11:03,848 --> 00:11:06,180
And you are
all about authority.

212
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,711
Yes. I am.

213
00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:12,313
The great speakers throughout
history were not joke tellers,

214
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,153
they were people
of passion.

215
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:16,659
So, if you wanna do well today,
you gotta do what they did.

216
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:17,819
Which is?

217
00:11:17,895 --> 00:11:22,457
You've gotta wave your arms, and you've
gotta pound your fists many times.

218
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,066
You're supposed
to emphasize your point.

219
00:11:25,136 --> 00:11:28,003
Okay, I didn't actually
major in Public Speaking.

220
00:11:28,072 --> 00:11:31,769
But I did download speeches from
some of history's famous dictators.

221
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:35,608
Like this one, originally
given by Benito Mussolini.

222
00:11:35,813 --> 00:11:39,340
Okay, look, I know you're
giving this speech on your own,

223
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:40,679
but I wrote up
a few talking points

224
00:11:40,751 --> 00:11:42,946
for you to take a look at.
I hope you don't mind.

225
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,419
I'll glance at it.

226
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,415
It's time, Dwight,
the Grim Reaper is here.

227
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:53,491
The very best of luck
to you, Dwight.

228
00:11:53,564 --> 00:11:55,555
Thank you, Angela.

229
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,740
Why'd you pick the V.A.
For the reception?

230
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:07,869
Roy has a connection.
It's nicer than you think.

231
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,541
You're inviting Jim? Of course,
he's one of my closest friends.

232
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,253
All right.

233
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:20,313
You ready?
Here we go.

234
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,859
Wow. It's a little bit bigger
than I remember.

235
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,560
Come on. We're down here in the front.

236
00:12:42,913 --> 00:12:44,813
You all ready for this?

237
00:12:55,626 --> 00:12:58,151
I am just feeling
under the weather,

238
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:01,763
and I think that
I will go home and rest.

239
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:04,528
I've never, ever seen
you take a sick day.

240
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:07,435
Well, I've seen you take
enough for the both of us.

241
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:10,001
Next, I'd like
to introduce

242
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:13,237
the Dunder Mifflin
salesman of the year,

243
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,073
Dwight Schrute!

244
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:22,881
Dwight,
they called your name.

245
00:13:22,953 --> 00:13:24,477
Dwight, how we doing?

246
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:26,983
No. I can't.
Okay, you know what?

247
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,924
I can't. You know what?
Okay no, no problem.

248
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:32,360
You are lucky you have me here.
I'm going to cover for you.

249
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:33,691
All right!

250
00:13:40,171 --> 00:13:44,835
Good morning, Vietnam!

251
00:13:47,878 --> 00:13:51,905
I am not Dwight Schrute,
not at all.

252
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:56,283
I am Michael Scott,
his mentor and boss.

253
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,556
And until Dwight comes up,
if he ever does,

254
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:05,192
I wanted to say
a few words about excellence.

255
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,593
What makes

256
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:09,963
a work environment excellent?

257
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:14,064
Well, there are many things,
I believe,

258
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:17,539
that do such a thing
of that nature.

259
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:22,111
And one would be humor.

260
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:26,410
What is the difference
between a salesman

261
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:28,041
and a saleswoman?

262
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:39,453
I always set it at 69.

263
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:43,662
Maybe we'll use a D J.

264
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:46,163
That's the one thing Roy is
in charge of for this wedding,

265
00:14:46,237 --> 00:14:48,535
but all he's managed
to do is set a date.

266
00:14:48,606 --> 00:14:51,575
But he did a great job.
June 10th is perfect.

267
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:54,270
I want a June wedding.
I've always wanted one.

268
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:58,114
Ryan, do you know when you
would want to get married?

269
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:01,350
Actually, I don't see
ever getting married.

270
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,658
Ryan, you should be more sensitive.
It's obvious she likes you

271
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,961
and comments like that, they
just... I know what I said.

272
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:20,136
I'm very sorry, I did not know
that you were wearing a hearing aid,

273
00:15:20,204 --> 00:15:23,537
and I just thought
you were speaking abnormally.

274
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:29,839
And now, the black guy from
the Police Academy movies,

275
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:32,176
a robot.

276
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:39,521
Michael Winslow. Anyone?

277
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:41,548
Car starting.

278
00:15:46,297 --> 00:15:48,458
All right,
Dwight Schrute, everyone.

279
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:52,094
Good luck,
that is a tough crowd.

280
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:12,418
Blood alone moves
the wheels of history!

281
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:18,186
Have you ever asked yourselves
in an hour of meditation,

282
00:16:18,263 --> 00:16:21,061
which everyone
finds during the day,

283
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:25,198
how long we have been
striving for greatness?

284
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:31,107
Not only the years we've
been at war, the war of work,

285
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,811
but from the moment,
as a child,

286
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:38,604
when we realized that the
world could be conquered.

287
00:16:39,751 --> 00:16:44,450
It has been a lifetime
struggle, a never-ending fight!

288
00:16:44,522 --> 00:16:47,821
I say to you,
and you will understand,

289
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:50,986
that it is a privilege
to fight!

290
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:59,460
We are warriors!

291
00:17:04,175 --> 00:17:08,134
Salesmen of Northeastern
Pennsylvania, I ask you,

292
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:12,411
once more rise and be worthy
of this historical hour!

293
00:17:18,556 --> 00:17:20,456
Yeah! Yeah!

294
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:24,757
I've got a timeshare in Key
West that might be available.

295
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:27,855
Maybe. Thanks.

296
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:29,460
You really think
you're gonna go?

297
00:17:29,534 --> 00:17:30,865
Yeah,
I'm definitely going.

298
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:33,369
Nice. Send me a postcard.

299
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:35,530
Jim has worked at the
same place for five years.

300
00:17:35,607 --> 00:17:39,008
Jim eats the same ham and cheese
sandwich every day for lunch.

301
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,169
I don't know, if I were
a betting man, I'd say

302
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:43,908
he will have a fun weekend
in Philadelphia.

303
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:54,818
No revolution is worth anything
unless it can defend itself!

304
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,488
Some people will tell you
"salesman" is a bad word.

305
00:18:03,101 --> 00:18:05,001
They'll conjure up images

306
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:09,165
of used car dealers
and door-to-door charlatans.

307
00:18:09,874 --> 00:18:12,809
This is our duty
to change their perception.

308
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:16,270
I say, salesmen

309
00:18:17,315 --> 00:18:20,751
and women
of the world, unite!

310
00:18:21,286 --> 00:18:25,518
We must never acquiesce,
for it is together...

311
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,590
Together that we prevail!

312
00:18:30,128 --> 00:18:33,825
We must never cede control
of the motherland!

313
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:36,257
For it is...

314
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:40,236
Together that we prevail!

315
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:53,711
Australia? I have always
wanted to go there.

316
00:18:53,785 --> 00:18:56,219
I'm going. I'm a little
nervous to run into Dwight

317
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:57,754
on his connecting flight
to Mordor,

318
00:18:57,822 --> 00:19:02,589
but, other than that... Yeah, I
bought the ticket, non-refundable.

319
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:04,455
That's awesome.
Where are you staying?

320
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:05,723
I don't know.

321
00:19:05,797 --> 00:19:08,459
I feel like I have plenty of time
to figure out the details, but...

322
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:10,057
When are you leaving?

323
00:19:10,835 --> 00:19:12,803
I'm leaving on June 8th.

324
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:17,099
Yeah.

325
00:19:17,575 --> 00:19:20,339
And I'm really sorry
about that. I just...

326
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:22,402
Yeah, that's too bad.

327
00:19:23,514 --> 00:19:24,606
Yeah.

328
00:19:27,852 --> 00:19:29,945
Do you want me to take
these on my way out?

329
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:31,784
It's okay. I got it.

330
00:19:32,624 --> 00:19:33,682
All right.

331
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:41,657
Okay, thanks. There
you are. What happened?

332
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,460
I got thirsty.
How'd it go?

333
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:46,059
It was amazing. I wish
you would have been there.

334
00:19:46,137 --> 00:19:47,434
You would not believe
what happened here.

335
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:49,200
What? Something happened?

336
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:53,402
This woman came in,
sat down,

337
00:19:53,478 --> 00:19:54,775
ordered a drink.

338
00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:57,576
The bartender asked for her
ID, which I thought was odd,

339
00:19:57,649 --> 00:19:58,946
because I pegged her at,
like, 35.

340
00:19:59,017 --> 00:20:00,609
Weird.
Yeah, really weird.

341
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:03,586
So, she's like, "I don't have
my ID, please give me one. "

342
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:06,522
And he's, like, "I can't do
that. I can't serve you. "

343
00:20:06,591 --> 00:20:08,149
Con artist.
She might have been.

344
00:20:08,226 --> 00:20:11,525
So she says, "Fine. I will go
to my room, I will get my purse,

345
00:20:11,596 --> 00:20:15,157
"I will come back, I'll show you
my ID." She hasn't come back yet.

346
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:17,895
She's probably in the room,
drinking from the mini bar.

347
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:19,869
Right?

348
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:22,230
Dwight gave
a great speech.

349
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,137
That's the word
on the street, anyway.

350
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:27,974
And I entertained Dwight
to no end with my bar story.

351
00:20:28,046 --> 00:20:32,278
So I captivated the guy who
captivated a thousand guys.

352
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:36,146
Can you believe that?
A thousand guys.
