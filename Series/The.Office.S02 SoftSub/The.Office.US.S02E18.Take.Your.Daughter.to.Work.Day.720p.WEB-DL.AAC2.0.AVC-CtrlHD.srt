1
00:00:00,017 --> 00:00:03,316
I am actually looking forward to
"Take Your Daughter to Work Day. "

2
00:00:03,387 --> 00:00:06,254
I am not great with kids,
but I wanna get better

3
00:00:06,624 --> 00:00:08,455
because I'm getting married.

4
00:00:08,726 --> 00:00:10,626
So I put out a bunch
of extra candy on my desk

5
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:12,788
so the kids will come
talk to me.

6
00:00:14,498 --> 00:00:16,932
Like the witch
in Hansel and Gretel.

7
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:20,102
Bribery. Nice.
Oh, I have more.

8
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:23,635
Name's Pam.
Miss Beesly, if you're nasty.

9
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:26,675
Janet Jackson. Hey, you having
a wardrobe malfunction there...

10
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:29,577
Michael, you can't be nasty
today. Because of that.

11
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:33,075
Oh, God. Is that today?
I reminded you last night.

12
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:34,748
Listen, I like kids.

13
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:36,411
But this is not
a kids' environment.

14
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:39,217
This is like HBO. No limits.

15
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:41,891
Who knows what I'm
gonna say? Crazy stuff.

16
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:45,085
And it is "R" rated.
It is not rated "G."

17
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:47,995
I am like Eddie Murphy in Raw.

18
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:50,064
And they are trying
to make me

19
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,624
into Eddie Murphy
in Daddy Day Care.

20
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:53,829
Both great movies, but still.

21
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:56,466
Well, I'll be in my office.

22
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,565
Don't you think you should
say something? They're cool.

23
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,667
Michael, I think that as
the boss you should really...

24
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:03,680
Fine, fine, fine, fine,
fine, fine. Hi, children.

25
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:08,908
I'm Michael Scott and I
am in charge of this place.

26
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:12,121
How do I make
you understand...

27
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:14,589
I am like Superman.

28
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,257
And the people who work here
are like citizens of Gotham City.

29
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:19,557
That's Batman.
That's Batman.

30
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,656
Okay. I'm Aquaman.
Where does he live, guys?

31
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:23,893
The ocean.

32
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:26,402
I work with a bunch of nerds.

33
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,737
Hello, tiny one.
Come on.

34
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,641
You are the future.

35
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:19,356
This is my file cabinet.

36
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:30,194
Oh, this is the partition

37
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:33,666
between my desk and Angela's.

38
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:37,670
Abby's my fiancee Stacey's
daughter.

39
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,402
I think she'll have
a good time.

40
00:02:39,477 --> 00:02:42,002
I just hope she doesn't
look on my computer.

41
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,679
Actually, I better go check.

42
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,851
Michael, you remember
my daughter, Melissa.

43
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,652
Oh, yes. Hello, how are you?
Good to see you.

44
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:56,556
Wow, you've really grown up.

45
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:58,954
You know what? If you
don't mind me saying so,

46
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:01,395
she is turning into
a stone cold fox.

47
00:03:01,465 --> 00:03:04,366
Better keep the frat boys
away from her.

48
00:03:04,902 --> 00:03:06,392
I'm in eighth grade.

49
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,937
She's in middle school.

50
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:10,974
Yeah, middle school's amazing.
It is extraordinary.

51
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:12,632
An extraordinary time.

52
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,575
It's not that children
make me uncomfortable.

53
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:17,705
It's just that, why be a dad
when you can be a fun uncle?

54
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,750
I've never heard of anyone
rebelling against their fun uncle.

55
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:24,185
They want how many
spiral pads? Well, 50...

56
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:27,216
I over-ordered because
they had a back-order.

57
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,280
Okay.

58
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:29,883
I got permission
to bring Jakey in to work.

59
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,588
Which is great because
he got suspended this week

60
00:03:32,663 --> 00:03:34,927
and now I don't have
to pay for a sitter.

61
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:37,200
Will you pull that
down there?

62
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:40,197
Okay, tell them
what you wanted to say.

63
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:43,399
Do you need any help? No. Thanks.

64
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:46,266
We'd have to explain
everything.

65
00:03:46,343 --> 00:03:49,210
It's probably just easier
if we do it ourselves.

66
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,344
All right, I wasn't
expecting that. Let's go draw.

67
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,476
Oh, my God. She is so cute
I wanna die.

68
00:03:56,554 --> 00:03:58,579
Don't you just love kids,
Angela?

69
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,789
I guess I wouldn't mind a pair
of small, well-behaved boys.

70
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,954
God, I cannot wait to get
pregnant and have babies.

71
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:10,326
Kelly and I both agreed
that we would just have fun.

72
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:12,892
And I'm learning
that fun for Kelly

73
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,962
is getting married
and having babies,

74
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:19,107
immediately, with me.

75
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,640
Just compare last year's order
to this year's.

76
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:25,908
Yeah, I'm looking at it
right now.

77
00:04:29,553 --> 00:04:30,918
Yes.

78
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:33,715
We...

79
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,350
Yeah, they're very...

80
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:39,956
They're different.

81
00:04:40,664 --> 00:04:42,461
Yeah, we can stick
with last year's,

82
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,831
we're just gonna have
to supplement it, somehow.

83
00:04:44,902 --> 00:04:49,100
Hey, Abby, do you wanna help
me shred some old documents?

84
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:52,301
It's actually pretty cool. No thanks.

85
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,977
I only have one goal today.
To make one kid like me.

86
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:00,741
Just one.

87
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,382
What are you reading?

88
00:05:02,453 --> 00:05:05,422
From the Mixed-Up Files
of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.

89
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,748
Best book.

90
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,791
Yeah, but I've read
it before. So have I.

91
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:12,588
Hey, question:

92
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:14,494
If you had to spend
the night in the Met

93
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,396
or the aquarium,
which would it be?

94
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:19,959
Definitely the aquarium.
Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that.

95
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,305
You don't wanna help me
with some of my sales, do you?

96
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:24,705
'Cause I'm kind of swamped.

97
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:27,243
Sure.
Really? Yes.

98
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:28,875
And you're Abby, right?
Yeah.

99
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:30,072
I'm Jim.

100
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:33,616
And, let's sell some paper. All right.

101
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:36,676
Let's start with your mom.

102
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:39,416
Yes. Well, we can...

103
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,023
Hey, you know what? Can I call
you back? I'll call you right back.

104
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,392
Yes, I promise.

105
00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:52,565
Hello. Can I help you?

106
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:58,106
You can pick that up if
you want. That's all right.

107
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:01,338
You wanna bring it over...

108
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:03,437
Here, I'll make some room.

109
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:14,182
My name's Michael.
What's your name? Sasha.

110
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:15,589
Nice to meet you.

111
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:19,654
Oh, you know what that is?
That is a train whistle.

112
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,491
Like I'm the conductor.

113
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,260
But I'm sort of the conductor
of the office here. Right?

114
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:28,230
You wanna try?
Sure.

115
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:30,696
All aboard for sales!

116
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:35,475
Next stop, Kukabonga.

117
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:40,944
You broke my hand!
There is no way that hurt.

118
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:43,542
Really? 'Cause she's
pretty strong, Dwight.

119
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,679
Little girl, come over here.

120
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,323
Shake my hand.

121
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,760
Come on.
I don't have all day.

122
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,657
I don't feel anything.
Nothing. You're so weak.

123
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:04,737
Excuse me. These are expensive
collectors' items, okay?

124
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:06,136
Do you have
any computer games?

125
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,610
No, I don't have computer
games on my work computer.

126
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:09,668
That would
be inappropriate.

127
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:12,739
Yeah, Meredith doesn't have
any either. It's so lame here.

128
00:07:12,816 --> 00:07:16,377
You call your mom, Meredith?
That's very disrespectful.

129
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:18,148
Whatever, okay?

130
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:20,722
You can refer to me
as Mr. Schrute.

131
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:22,290
That's your name?

132
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:24,251
Mr. Poop?
Schrute.

133
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:27,221
Mr. Schrute.
Sure, Mr. Poop.

134
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:31,862
Schrute.

135
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:41,240
Are you Mother Goose?

136
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,744
I drink like a hundred iced macchiatos
a day and practically nothing else.

137
00:07:47,818 --> 00:07:48,842
Wow.

138
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:52,377
There's a really cool coffee place,
Jitterz, at the Steamtown Mall.

139
00:07:52,456 --> 00:07:54,424
You ever been there?
No.

140
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:58,457
You've never been to Jitterz?
Ryan, you are so dorky.

141
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:01,227
Give me your number
so I can text you.

142
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:05,663
Come on.

143
00:08:06,203 --> 00:08:07,602
Do you have
an e-mail address?

144
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:10,231
I may be wrong, but I just
thought you should know.

145
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:12,605
I think something
a little fishy is going on.

146
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:14,303
A little fishy?
Yeah.

147
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:17,677
I mean, I've been noticing them
all day, and I just think...

148
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:19,575
That little girl is a child!

149
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,051
I don't wanna see you sniffing
around her anymore this afternoon.

150
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,178
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.

151
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,551
Boy, have you lost your mind? No.

152
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:27,590
'Cause I'll help you find it.
What you looking for?

153
00:08:27,658 --> 00:08:28,920
Ain't nobody gonna
help you out there.

154
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:30,118
Jesus can come
through that door

155
00:08:30,194 --> 00:08:31,183
and he's not
gonna help you

156
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,252
if you don't stop sniffing
after my child. Okay.

157
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:35,294
Stanley yelled at me today.

158
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:39,165
That was one of the most
frightening experiences of my life.

159
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:53,882
That was Greensleeves,
a traditional English ballad

160
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,885
about the beheaded
Anne Boleyn.

161
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,387
And now,
a very special treat.

162
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,390
A book my grom-mutter used
to read me when I was a kid.

163
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,519
This is a very special story.
It's called Struwwelpeterl

164
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:09,323
by Heinrich Hoffmann
from 1864.

165
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,233
"The great tall tailor
always comes

166
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,271
"to little girls
that suck their thumbs. "

167
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:17,102
Are you listening, Sasha?
Right?

168
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:19,165
"And ere they dream
what he's about,

169
00:09:19,243 --> 00:09:21,677
"he takes his great
sharp scissors out

170
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,110
"and then cuts their thumbs
clean off. "

171
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:25,239
Dwight, Dwight...
There's a photo.

172
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,407
What the hell are
you reading to them?

173
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,848
These are cautionary tales
for kids.

174
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:28,942
My grom-mutter
used to read them...

175
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:30,179
Yeah, you know what?
No, no, no, no.

176
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:32,552
They... No. The kids don't
wanna hear some weirdo book

177
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:34,887
that your Nazi war criminal
grandmother gave you.

178
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,892
What's a Nazi?
What's a Nazi?

179
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,427
Nazi was a fascist movement... Don't...

180
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,588
From the 1930s in Germany...
Don't, don't talk about Nazis

181
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,859
in front of... You know what?
They're gonna have nightmares.

182
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:43,957
Why don't you
just shut it?

183
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:47,299
I was gonna teach the children
how to make cornhusk dolls.

184
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:50,807
Why don't you just leave, okay? Okay.

185
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:54,739
Bye, Mr. Poop. All right.
There goes Mr. Poop.

186
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,779
Now, who likes Dane Cook?

187
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,109
I do!
I do!

188
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,014
Children cannot lie. They are
innocent and they speak the truth.

189
00:10:01,084 --> 00:10:03,416
And out of the mouths
of babes,

190
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:06,149
Michael Scott
is freaking cool.

191
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,111
You know, I never misbehaved
in front of my father

192
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:18,049
because he was
a very strict disciplinarian.

193
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,986
I can only hope my mate has
some of those same qualities.

194
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:30,325
This is where the magic
happens. Right over here.

195
00:10:30,398 --> 00:10:31,763
Let me show you this.

196
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:35,859
See all these? You know
what that is? That's paper.

197
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,996
This is where paper
comes from. Any questions?

198
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,175
So, you cut the paper
and dye it and stuff?

199
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:45,311
No, we don't actually cut the
paper. That's a good question.

200
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:49,713
The paper is sent to us, cut and
dyed, from a paper manufacturer.

201
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:53,844
And then we sell it to a business
for more than we paid for it.

202
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:55,183
That's not fair.
No.

203
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:57,247
Yes, it is. Well...
No.

204
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,349
You need someone in the
middle to facilitate...

205
00:10:59,427 --> 00:11:01,361
You're just a middleman.
I'm not just a middleman.

206
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:04,364
Wait. Why doesn't the sawmill just
sell the paper directly to people?

207
00:11:04,432 --> 00:11:06,730
You are describing
Office Depot.

208
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:08,735
And they're kind of
running us out of business.

209
00:11:08,803 --> 00:11:10,998
We have better service
than they do.

210
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:15,005
There's Creed!
Let's take a look

211
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:17,237
at what he's doing,
everybody.

212
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,112
This is Creed.

213
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:22,978
And he is in charge
of something.

214
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,074
Right?
That is correct.

215
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,085
Say hi to the kids.
Hi, kids.

216
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:29,648
Have you ever seen
a foot with four toes?

217
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:32,684
What are you doing? Stop it! Stop
it! Just... No, no, no, no, no!

218
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,022
Would you cut it out?

219
00:11:34,095 --> 00:11:36,188
What is your problem? The
hair covers it up mostly.

220
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:39,323
No, no, no, we're not gonna
see the four-toed Creed, okay?

221
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,231
You know, there's something
interesting about me

222
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:45,136
that you might want to know. I
used to be the star of a kids' show.

223
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:47,140
No way! It's true. I did.

224
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,108
You serious?
I am totally serious.

225
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:52,668
There was a show called Fundle
Bundle and I was the star.

226
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,407
That doesn't sound
like a show. It's true.

227
00:11:54,482 --> 00:11:56,177
I can prove it.
I can prove it. Watch this.

228
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,343
Ryan! Can you
come here a second?

229
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,788
I would like you to go to my
mother's house in Dickson City.

230
00:12:02,857 --> 00:12:03,983
And if she is at the pool,

231
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:05,889
the back kitchen window
should be unlocked.

232
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,518
I want you to boost
yourself up. All right.

233
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:10,086
I want you to go down to the
basement. In the basement is a tape

234
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:11,358
labeled "Fundle Bundle. "

235
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:13,400
I want you to grab it. I
want you to get my guitar.

236
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:14,798
Right. Okay. I want
you to get a tambourine.

237
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:16,234
Do you know
how to play the tambourine?

238
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,294
I'm already getting the
pizzas from Brunetti's, so...

239
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:20,237
You know, I can go with him. No!

240
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:23,401
I will go.
Okay. Thank you, Ryan.

241
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,438
Good attitude.
Hottest in the office.

242
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:28,277
All right. Now, what kind
of pizza do you like?

243
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:30,180
I don't get why parents
are always complaining

244
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,446
about how tough it is
to raise kids.

245
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:33,979
You joke around with them,

246
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:36,284
you give them pizza,
you give them candy,

247
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:39,383
you let them live their lives.
They're adults, for God's sake.

248
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,793
I am going to give you
a little blast from the past

249
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:45,696
of Michael Gary Scott,
when he was a child star

250
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:49,096
and a show that you might
remember called Fundle Bundle.

251
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,331
Okay,
without further ado, Ryan.

252
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:53,430
Fundle, are you ready

253
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:54,906
Yeah!

254
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,203
Let's have some fun!

255
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:58,871
That is Miss Trudy. You
can't tell from the costume,

256
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,937
but she had
an amazing body.

257
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:04,115
Okay,
you can fast-forward.

258
00:13:04,185 --> 00:13:06,278
And I want you...
Is that a real,

259
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:08,412
functioning windmill?
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop.

260
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,915
Yes! That is
Edward R. Meow.

261
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:17,019
That's pretty funny.
Yes.

262
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:20,066
Recess!
Hey, what's your name?

263
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:22,261
My name's Chet.
Well, hi, Chet.

264
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,998
Is that Chet Montgomery? I don't know.

265
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:28,838
That is! He's the
meteorologist from channel 5.

266
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:31,173
"Checking in with Chet.
Doppler 7."

267
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:33,474
That guy's legit.

268
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:37,347
What do you wanna be when
you grow up? I wanna be on TV.

269
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:39,977
And he is on TV now!

270
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:43,490
Would everybody please shut up?
Please. So you don't miss it.

271
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:45,957
Okay, next.

272
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:49,025
So, what's your name?
Oh, that's me! That's me!

273
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:53,332
What's your favorite subject in school?

274
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,961
Recess.

275
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:59,699
So, tell me, what do you
wanna be when you grow up?

276
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:04,544
I wanna be married and have a 100
kids so I can have 100 friends,

277
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:07,443
and no one can say no
to being my friend.

278
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:17,985
Okay. Well, nice talking with you,
Michael. Back to you, Miss Trudy.

279
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:21,385
Hi, everyone. It's one of my favorite...
I could have sworn there was...

280
00:14:21,462 --> 00:14:24,090
Did you get married?
No.

281
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,697
Why not?
It just never happened.

282
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:30,868
So, do you have any kids?
Nope.

283
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:33,406
Do you have a girlfriend? I do okay.

284
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:34,907
Was Chet Montgomery cool back then? Yes.

285
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:37,443
Even I have a girlfriend.
Okay. All right. Okay.

286
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:40,207
So, you didn't get to be
what you wanted to be?

287
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:42,981
I guess not.

288
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:47,854
You know,
I have a load of work to do.

289
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:51,448
So, I am going to grab
a slice of this delish pizza

290
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,524
and I'm gonna go
do my work.

291
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,253
Bye.

292
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,269
He's not coming out.
He won't pick up the phone.

293
00:15:09,477 --> 00:15:11,138
I can't believe his mom
dressed him like that.

294
00:15:11,212 --> 00:15:12,907
That's the real tragedy.

295
00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:16,346
Pam, Pam!
I love this guy!

296
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:18,711
Come on!

297
00:15:26,895 --> 00:15:30,228
So, Melissa, I met your mom
a couple times.

298
00:15:30,298 --> 00:15:31,788
She's so nice.

299
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:33,958
Who, Teri?

300
00:15:35,036 --> 00:15:37,903
That woman is not my mother.
That is my stepmother.

301
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:44,204
Mr. Poop, I have
to tell you something.

302
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,804
Okay. But first,
that's not my name.

303
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:48,143
You're ugly.

304
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:53,381
Well, at least I'm not a
horrible little latchkey kid

305
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:55,548
who got suspended
from school.

306
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,284
So...

307
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:59,054
Meredith!

308
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:13,265
Yeah?

309
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:16,971
I think these
belong to you.

310
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:20,804
Oh, that's okay.
She can keep those.

311
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:23,146
Believe me,
she has enough toys.

312
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:25,578
She doesn't need
your watch.

313
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:27,652
Thank you.

314
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:32,516
Is everything okay?

315
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:37,820
You have to ask me that because
you work for Human Resources.

316
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:40,261
That's true.

317
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:43,768
You know, sure, playing the field
is great. Don't get me wrong.

318
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:46,739
But there's more to life
than notches on my bedpost.

319
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:48,635
Tell me something honestly.

320
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:53,511
Do you think that it is too
late for me to have kids?

321
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:57,045
Well, you need a wife first.
Or at least a girlfriend.

322
00:16:57,118 --> 00:16:58,881
What about...
Not Jan.

323
00:16:58,953 --> 00:16:59,942
Okay.

324
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:03,888
If you really wanna have kids,
I guess you could somehow...

325
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:08,756
A foster parent or something.

326
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:12,557
Or biologically.

327
00:17:13,434 --> 00:17:14,696
Somehow.

328
00:17:16,137 --> 00:17:19,004
Thanks. That's... No, that
really means a lot to me.

329
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,545
Hey, does Sasha have
a godfather? Because...

330
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:27,308
Yes.
Okay.

331
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:32,119
Is it okay if I take one?
Sure.

332
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:34,284
Thank you.
You're welcome.

333
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,587
Is your job hard?
It's not too bad.

334
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:42,255
I get to shred things
sometimes. Do you wanna see?

335
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,388
Yeah!

336
00:17:43,464 --> 00:17:44,829
Really?
Yeah.

337
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:46,325
Okay.

338
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,005
Here it is. Don't put
your fingers in there.

339
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:56,836
Cool, huh?
That's so cool, yeah!

340
00:17:58,379 --> 00:18:00,142
Yeah, I get to do this,
like, every week.

341
00:18:00,214 --> 00:18:01,681
That's so awesome.
I know.

342
00:18:01,883 --> 00:18:03,976
Yes, it is true.

343
00:18:04,052 --> 00:18:08,352
I, Michael Scott, am signing up
with an online dating service.

344
00:18:08,456 --> 00:18:11,516
Thousands of people have done
it. And I am going to do it.

345
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:14,960
I need a username.
And I have a great one.

346
00:18:20,835 --> 00:18:21,961
Little Kid Lover.

347
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:25,836
That way people will know exactly
where my priorities are at.

348
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:30,073
Go ahead.

349
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:33,504
Do you wanna come over
for dinner tonight?

350
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:35,811
Oh, man, I would love to.

351
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:38,750
I can't tonight. But can I
come over some other time?

352
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,618
What are you doing?
You never have plans.

353
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,316
Thanks, Kev.

354
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:46,588
I'm actually going on a date.
Nice.

355
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:49,890
Hey, no please.
You can't leave yet.

356
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:52,489
There's still one more
thing we need to do.

357
00:18:53,434 --> 00:18:57,234
You who are
on the road

358
00:18:57,972 --> 00:19:00,304
Must have a code

359
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:04,172
that you can live by

360
00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:08,848
And so become yourself

361
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:11,819
Because the past

362
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:15,617
is just a good bye

363
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:20,391
And teach your children well

364
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:23,191
Why does he own a guitar if
he doesn't know how to play.

365
00:19:23,264 --> 00:19:26,233
I think he thought his
ukulele skills would transfer.

366
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:32,862
And feed them
on your dreams

367
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,498
My theory is that...

368
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:36,668
The one they picks

369
00:19:37,512 --> 00:19:41,243
the one you'll know by

370
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,751
Don't you ever ask them why

371
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,721
If I told you, you would cry

372
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:52,988
You just look at them and sigh

373
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:59,192
and know they love you

374
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:02,429
And they do. Your parents
love you very much.

375
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:03,765
One more time.

376
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:04,827
You...

377
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,923
The Schrutes consider
children very valuable.

378
00:20:07,994 --> 00:20:10,929
In the olden days, the women
would bear many children,

379
00:20:10,997 --> 00:20:13,329
so we would have enough
laborers to work the fields.

380
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:15,424
And if it was
an especially cold winter

381
00:20:15,502 --> 00:20:18,062
and there weren't
enough grains or vegetables,

382
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:20,698
they would eat
the weakest of the brood.

383
00:20:21,775 --> 00:20:24,573
No, they didn't eat
the children.

384
00:20:25,078 --> 00:20:26,670
It never came to that.
