1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:04,430
Hey, have they left for the big
meeting yet? I got Michael's lucky tie.

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,166
No, they're in
the conference room.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,264
Okay.

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,899
Wait. Are those
Michael's Levi's?

5
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:11,103
Yeah. Who
dry-cleans jeans?

6
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,270
Michael and his jeans.

7
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,942
He gets in them, and I'm not
exactly sure what happens,

8
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:22,013
but I can tell you he loves
the way he looks in those jeans.

9
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,817
I know that's why he started
Casual Fridays.

10
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,917
I'll take those. Thanks.

11
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:07,746
This is a projection
of the county's needs.

12
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,947
Wow. Graphs and charts.

13
00:01:10,022 --> 00:01:11,046
So...

14
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:13,091
Somebody's really been
doing their homework.

15
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:14,488
Looks like USA Today.

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,427
Thirteen schools,
two hospitals...

17
00:01:17,496 --> 00:01:20,431
So, this possible client they're
talking about, actually a big deal.

18
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:23,593
It's Lackawanna County,
our whole county.

19
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:27,904
And if we get this, they might
not have to downsize our branch.

20
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,441
And I could work here
for years.

21
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:33,942
And years.

22
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:37,513
And years.

23
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,513
So when we
get to the Radisson,

24
00:01:39,585 --> 00:01:42,816
I would like to... Oh,
I changed it to Chili's.

25
00:01:42,888 --> 00:01:43,855
Excuse me?

26
00:01:43,922 --> 00:01:46,356
Radisson,
it just gives out this vibe.

27
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:48,586
It's like, "Oh, I'm doing
business at the Radisson. "

28
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,651
It's kind of snooty. So...

29
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,128
You had no right
to do that, Michael.

30
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:56,031
Here's the thing. "Chili's
is the new golf course.

31
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:58,194
"It's where business happens. "

32
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,602
Small Businessman Magazine.

33
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:02,496
It said that?

34
00:02:02,574 --> 00:02:04,804
It will. I sent it in.
Letter to the editor.

35
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:10,040
All right. But you will
let me run this meeting.

36
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,708
Power trip.

37
00:02:12,785 --> 00:02:13,774
What?

38
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:17,549
She had done a background check
on me. She had it printed out.

39
00:02:17,623 --> 00:02:18,715
No.
Yeah.

40
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:22,158
And she was asking me about stuff, line
by line, while we were having dinner.

41
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:23,216
That is unbelievable.

42
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:24,319
What's going on?

43
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:26,591
We are doing
worst first dates.

44
00:02:26,665 --> 00:02:27,859
Oh, my God, I win.

45
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:30,835
Okay, it was
a minor league hockey game,

46
00:02:30,903 --> 00:02:32,495
he brought his brother,

47
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:34,061
and when I went
to the bathroom,

48
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:36,004
the game ended
and they forgot about me.

49
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:37,507
Okay, that's a joke.

50
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:38,565
No, they had to
come back for me.

51
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:41,107
Wait, when was this?

52
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,569
Um...

53
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,441
It was not that long ago.

54
00:02:46,852 --> 00:02:49,844
Wait, not Roy.
Say it's not your fiance.

55
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:56,891
I always knew Pam has refused
to go to sports games with Roy,

56
00:02:57,296 --> 00:02:59,127
but I never knew why.

57
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:02,131
Interesting.

58
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:05,866
Okay, let's do this thing.
Wish us luck.

59
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:07,599
Good luck, Michael.
Good luck, Jan.

60
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:08,799
Thank you.
Kiss ass.

61
00:03:08,874 --> 00:03:13,174
Okay, probably going to go late
tonight, burning the midnight tequila.

62
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:16,510
So, I think you all
could just take off now.

63
00:03:16,582 --> 00:03:18,550
Michael, this shouldn't take
more than an hour.

64
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:20,608
Well... Do you always
shut down the entire office

65
00:03:20,686 --> 00:03:22,779
when you leave for an hour?

66
00:03:22,855 --> 00:03:25,380
No, no.
That would not be efficient.

67
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:29,722
Actually, they just don't get very
much work done when I'm not here.

68
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:33,493
That's not true,
I know how to delegate.

69
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:36,396
And they do more work
when I'm not here.

70
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:37,933
Not more.

71
00:03:38,437 --> 00:03:41,998
The same amount of work is
done, whether I'm here or not.

72
00:03:43,575 --> 00:03:45,167
Hey, everybody, listen up!

73
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:48,975
This is what we're gonna do.
You sit tight until I return.

74
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:52,039
Sound good? Doesn't
matter, it's an order.

75
00:03:52,618 --> 00:03:54,017
Follow it blindly.

76
00:03:54,853 --> 00:03:55,979
Okay.

77
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:59,514
All right, ciao. Adios!

78
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:02,492
So which way is Chili's?

79
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:03,926
I'll drive.

80
00:04:03,996 --> 00:04:06,089
No, that's all right. I wanna
leave straight from there.

81
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:07,631
It is just a couple blocks away, so...

82
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:09,326
Boy, you really don't know
Scranton, do you?

83
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:10,629
I know Scranton.
At all!

84
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:12,693
All right... Have you
ever been to Scranton, Jan?

85
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:14,762
If it's a couple of blocks
away, we can go together.

86
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,932
Okay.

87
00:04:16,008 --> 00:04:18,806
Jan Levinson-Gould.
Jan is cold.

88
00:04:18,877 --> 00:04:21,744
If she was sitting across from you
on a train and she wasn't moving,

89
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:23,576
you might think she was dead.

90
00:04:24,216 --> 00:04:26,980
We should come up
with a signal of some sort.

91
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:28,246
Why would we need a signal?

92
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,346
Well, in case one of us gets into
trouble, the other one can signal...

93
00:04:31,423 --> 00:04:33,755
What kind of trouble are you
planning on getting in, Michael?

94
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:35,122
Well, it could be
either of us.

95
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:37,661
You're gonna let me do the
talking, we agreed on that.

96
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:39,526
Yes.

97
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:45,496
Hello? Christian?
Yes.

98
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,935
I thought that was you. Hi. Hi.

99
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:48,802
Michael Scott.
This is Jan Levinson-Gould.

100
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:49,863
Just " Jan Levinson. "

101
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:51,669
And... No Gould?
No.

102
00:04:51,743 --> 00:04:54,576
Thank you very much for meeting
with us. Have you been waiting long?

103
00:04:54,646 --> 00:04:56,079
No, not long.
Good. Good.

104
00:04:56,148 --> 00:04:58,241
Jan, what happened?
Michael.

105
00:04:58,317 --> 00:05:00,478
Is Gould dead? What...

106
00:05:00,552 --> 00:05:02,452
Michael, we got
divorced, okay?

107
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:04,546
I'm so sorry, excuse me.
Wow, you're kidding me.

108
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:06,386
Do you want to talk about it? Michael.

109
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,221
Could we have
a table for three, please?

110
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:09,282
When did this happen?

111
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,385
We're in a meeting.

112
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:11,757
Okay.
This way, please.

113
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,525
Christian. All right, after you.

114
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:14,929
Thank you.

115
00:05:19,304 --> 00:05:22,296
I thought we could start by going
over the needs of the county.

116
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:23,500
Right.

117
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:28,069
Well, Lackawanna County has not been
immune to the slow economic growth

118
00:05:28,146 --> 00:05:29,909
over the past five years.

119
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:33,611
So for us, the name of the
game is budget reduction and...

120
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:35,050
Awesome Blossom?

121
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,109
What?

122
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:38,079
I think we should share
an Awesome Blossom.

123
00:05:38,156 --> 00:05:39,646
What do you say?
They are awesome.

124
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:41,420
You want to, Christian?
Blossom?

125
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:42,482
Sure.

126
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:43,823
Okay, it's done.

127
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:45,328
Actually, Megan?

128
00:05:45,397 --> 00:05:46,887
May we have an Awesome Blossom, please?

129
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:48,933
Extra awesome.
Now it is done.

130
00:05:49,234 --> 00:05:50,360
So, if you have a...

131
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:53,336
Hey, I heard a very, very
funny joke the other day.

132
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:54,394
You wanna hear it?

133
00:05:54,473 --> 00:05:56,532
Christian, you don't have
to listen to this.

134
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:58,799
We can... It's okay, I like jokes.

135
00:05:58,877 --> 00:06:00,003
Okay.

136
00:06:00,078 --> 00:06:01,204
Just the one.

137
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,940
Just one joke? Okay.

138
00:06:03,015 --> 00:06:04,573
Well, if it's just
going to be one,

139
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:07,482
I will think
of a different joke.

140
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:08,541
Um...

141
00:06:09,554 --> 00:06:10,885
Let's see.

142
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,680
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

143
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,748
Pam, it's Michael.

144
00:06:14,826 --> 00:06:17,624
I need you to go into my office
and check some data for me.

145
00:06:17,763 --> 00:06:20,288
Okay, you want me
to read them?

146
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:21,488
Yes.

147
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:24,431
Okay. "A fisherman
is walking down Fifth Avenue,

148
00:06:24,503 --> 00:06:26,801
"leading an animal behind
him when... " No, no.

149
00:06:26,872 --> 00:06:29,102
Told it, not as good as
you think. Pick another one.

150
00:06:29,174 --> 00:06:31,972
Okay. "There's a transcript
between a naval ship... "

151
00:06:32,044 --> 00:06:35,605
Okay! Bingo!
And a lighthouse.

152
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,772
Yes. That is hysterical.

153
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:38,713
Could you start that one
from the beginning?

154
00:06:38,784 --> 00:06:42,015
Sure. "There's a transcript between
a naval ship and a lighthouse... "

155
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:02,465
Is this real?

156
00:07:02,574 --> 00:07:06,010
It is a screenplay
starring himself.

157
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:08,235
Agent Michael Scarn.

158
00:07:08,313 --> 00:07:09,940
Of the FBI.

159
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:11,209
How long is this?

160
00:07:11,283 --> 00:07:13,979
Oh, Pam! Good work!

161
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,387
Oh, wait, stop. Drawings.

162
00:07:18,457 --> 00:07:19,446
What is that?

163
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:20,548
Oh, those are drawings.

164
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:24,857
In case the writing didn't
really put a picture in your head.

165
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,366
And there he is, in the flesh,
Agent Michael Scarn.

166
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:30,333
Now we know
what he looks like.

167
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:34,462
The first guy says, "Well, I'm an
astronaut, so I drive a Saturn. "

168
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:35,938
And the second guy says,

169
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:39,841
"Well, I am a pimp,
so I drive a cheap Escort. "

170
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:41,936
And the third guy says,
"I got you both beat.

171
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:46,006
"I'm a proctologist,
so I drive a brown Probe. "

172
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:48,484
Oh, no! No!

173
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:52,614
Oh, my God, that's funny!

174
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,651
I almost had Awesome Blossom
coming out of my nose!

175
00:07:57,863 --> 00:07:59,831
Excuse me, could I have
a vodka tonic, please?

176
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:00,364
Do we all have our copy

177
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:03,661
of Threat Level Midnight
by Michael Scott?

178
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:05,100
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

179
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,899
All right,
let's get this started.

180
00:08:06,972 --> 00:08:10,135
I'm gonna be reading
the action descriptions

181
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,075
and, Phyllis, I would like you
to play Catherine Zeta- Jones.

182
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:14,772
That's the character's name?
Oh, yeah.

183
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:16,643
You guys
should not be doing this.

184
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:18,706
Why not, Dwight?
This is a movie.

185
00:08:18,783 --> 00:08:21,479
I mean, this is for
all of America to enjoy.

186
00:08:21,553 --> 00:08:23,885
You took something
that doesn't belong to you...

187
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:25,946
Dwight.... brought it in
here and made copies of it.

188
00:08:26,024 --> 00:08:29,585
Do you want to play the lead
role of Agent Michael Scarn?

189
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:36,393
Hey, that's delicious.
I love it.

190
00:08:36,468 --> 00:08:39,335
We would probably be upset
with ourselves

191
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:42,532
if we went this whole night
without talking business,

192
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:45,007
so Dunder Mifflin can provide

193
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:47,636
a level of personal service
to the county

194
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:50,044
that the warehouse chains
just can't match.

195
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:51,639
Well, we are out
to save money.

196
00:08:51,716 --> 00:08:52,876
What's the bottom line?

197
00:08:56,321 --> 00:08:59,984
That's why I wanted
a signal between us,

198
00:09:00,058 --> 00:09:02,822
so I wouldn't have
to just shout nonsense words.

199
00:09:02,894 --> 00:09:04,555
That's her fault.

200
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:07,826
Did somebody say,
"baby back ribs"?

201
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:11,535
Hmm? Hmm?

202
00:09:11,603 --> 00:09:13,594
I don't think Christian
has time for that...

203
00:09:13,672 --> 00:09:14,832
I have time.

204
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:20,542
I want my baby back,
baby back, baby back

205
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:22,136
I want my baby-back,
baby-back, baby-back

206
00:09:22,214 --> 00:09:24,705
Chili's baby-back ribs I
want my baby-back, baby-back

207
00:09:24,783 --> 00:09:28,412
"Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn
sits with his feet up on his desk.

208
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:30,750
"Catherine Zeta- Jones
enters. "

209
00:09:30,956 --> 00:09:32,480
"Sir, you have some messages. "

210
00:09:32,557 --> 00:09:33,546
"Not now!"

211
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,614
"They're important. "

212
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:36,591
"Okay, what are they?"

213
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:40,888
"The first message is, 'I
love you. ' That's from me. "

214
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:43,526
"Not in a thousand years,
Catherine, we work together.

215
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:45,126
"And get off my desk. "

216
00:09:45,203 --> 00:09:46,727
Yes, I have acted before.

217
00:09:46,805 --> 00:09:49,740
I was in a production of
Oklahoma! In the seventh grade.

218
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:52,902
I played the part
of Mutie the Mailman.

219
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:57,072
They had too many kids, so
they made up roles like that.

220
00:09:57,816 --> 00:09:58,942
I was good.

221
00:09:59,284 --> 00:10:02,651
"If it isn't my old partner,
Samuel L. Chang. "

222
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:06,749
"Agent Michael Scarn,
you lost some weight. "

223
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:09,283
"Thank you for noticing.

224
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:12,222
"Now, keep me company
for one more mission. "

225
00:10:12,297 --> 00:10:13,525
Hey, I have to work late.

226
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:15,998
"But as soon as I
blow out these candles... "

227
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:17,466
You're joking, right?

228
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:20,698
Michael Scarn takes out a
9mm gun and shoots the cake.

229
00:10:23,642 --> 00:10:27,305
"Agent Michael Scarn,
you so funny. Word. "

230
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:31,213
Michael's movie?
Two thumbs down.

231
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,050
"A man, sitting several seats
down, who has a gold face,

232
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:43,822
"turns to Michael Scarn. "

233
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:47,391
Oscar? Do you want
to play "Golden Face"?

234
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,229
"Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be
more comfortable in my private jet. "

235
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:56,172
"Yes, perhaps I would, Golden
Face. Sam, get my luggage. "

236
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:58,038
"I forget it, brother. "

237
00:10:58,109 --> 00:10:59,701
"Samuel,
you are such an idiot.

238
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:02,872
"You are the worst assistant
ever and you're disgusting. "

239
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:05,074
"Dwigt. " Wait, who's Dwigt?

240
00:11:06,484 --> 00:11:07,951
Here's what we think happened.

241
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:09,316
Michael's sidekick,

242
00:11:09,387 --> 00:11:11,981
who all through the movie,
is this complete idiot

243
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:14,753
who's causing the downfall
of the United States,

244
00:11:14,826 --> 00:11:17,124
was originally named Dwight,

245
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:20,255
but then Michael changed it
to Samuel L. Chang

246
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:21,924
using a search and replace.

247
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,298
But that doesn't work
on misspelled words,

248
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:27,065
leaving behind one "Dwigt. "

249
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:29,430
And Dwight figured it out.

250
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:30,599
Oops!

251
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:34,140
D- W-I-G-H-T.

252
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:37,772
Okay, you know what? I am done
with this. That's it. The end.

253
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:40,443
Well, some of us wanna keep
reading, if you don't...

254
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:43,976
You don't speak for everyone,
Jim. Okay, announcement.

255
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:46,285
My uncle bought me
some fireworks.

256
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:50,419
And anyone who wants to see a real
show, come with me outside now.

257
00:11:51,262 --> 00:11:52,286
That's actually a good idea.

258
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:54,389
We'll all take
a brief intermission.

259
00:11:54,466 --> 00:11:55,865
Hey, are you hungry?

260
00:11:55,934 --> 00:11:57,333
Yeah.
Yeah?

261
00:11:57,535 --> 00:12:00,868
And so, after watching my
mom go through so much pain,

262
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:04,397
I decided to keep that
promise that I made to her,

263
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:06,003
and take care of her.

264
00:12:07,178 --> 00:12:11,444
Well, this brings us to Jan. Truth
or dare. Tell us about your divorce.

265
00:12:11,516 --> 00:12:13,347
Oh, no! Michael. Michael.
Do.

266
00:12:13,418 --> 00:12:15,545
Michael. Michael, please. No.
Do, right?

267
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,417
Really. It's... Hey, you
say you're not gonna play.

268
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:19,252
She's not playing.
She's not playing the game.

269
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:20,916
It isn't fair. We'd been
fighting for a while.

270
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:22,084
Check, please.
He didn't want kids.

271
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,458
I knew that going into it,
but he also knew that I did.

272
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:26,520
So I guess I thought that
he would change his mind,

273
00:12:26,598 --> 00:12:28,828
he thought
that I would change mine.

274
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,128
You didn't?

275
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:31,293
I was stupid.

276
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:35,095
No, no,
you were not stupid.

277
00:12:35,907 --> 00:12:37,465
Gould was stupid, right?

278
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:38,531
That's right.

279
00:12:38,643 --> 00:12:40,201
You know?
You were really brave.

280
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:43,509
I mean, you put your arms out
there, you slit your wrists.

281
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:44,639
That's true.

282
00:12:44,716 --> 00:12:48,516
You said, "World, this is my
blood, it's red, just like yours.

283
00:12:48,586 --> 00:12:50,053
"So love me. "

284
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,089
I had plans to meet a friend
tonight, which I had to cancel.

285
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:57,051
But this is cool, too.

286
00:12:57,495 --> 00:12:59,292
I'm not a complainer.

287
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:05,060
Wow.

288
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:06,296
For the bugs.

289
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:07,531
Nice.

290
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:10,733
And that's excellent
because bugs love

291
00:13:11,276 --> 00:13:12,743
my famous grilled
cheese sandwich.

292
00:13:12,811 --> 00:13:13,800
Yes.

293
00:13:14,512 --> 00:13:15,638
Nice.

294
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:19,906
I can't remember the last
time someone made me dinner.

295
00:13:24,956 --> 00:13:26,082
Yeah!

296
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:29,418
Yes!

297
00:13:33,631 --> 00:13:35,462
Right down the street?

298
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:37,125
Kenneth Road,
born and raised.

299
00:13:37,435 --> 00:13:40,404
Spent my whole life right
here in Lackawanna County

300
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:42,702
and I do not intend
on moving.

301
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:46,100
I know this place. I know
how many hospitals we have.

302
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:49,943
I know how many schools we
have. It's home, you know?

303
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:53,751
I know the challenges that
this county is up against.

304
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:56,412
Here's the thing about those
discount suppliers, they don't care.

305
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:58,786
They come in,
they undercut everything,

306
00:13:58,857 --> 00:14:01,018
and they run us
out of business.

307
00:14:01,092 --> 00:14:04,255
And then, once we're all gone,
they jack up the prices.

308
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:05,421
I know.
It's bad.

309
00:14:05,497 --> 00:14:06,486
It's terrible.

310
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:07,553
It is. You know what?
It really is.

311
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,157
I don't know.

312
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:16,236
I guess I could give you guys our business,
but you have to meet me halfway, okay,

313
00:14:16,307 --> 00:14:18,901
because they're expecting me
to make cuts.

314
00:14:18,977 --> 00:14:23,710
Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic,
but you think we could, Jan?

315
00:14:27,252 --> 00:14:30,153
So I guess
I'll see you in

316
00:14:30,855 --> 00:14:31,947
10 hours.

317
00:14:32,023 --> 00:14:33,650
What are you gonna do
with your time off?

318
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:34,749
Travel.

319
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:35,815
Yeah.

320
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:36,883
I've been looking
forward to it.

321
00:14:37,996 --> 00:14:39,486
It's gonna be

322
00:14:40,765 --> 00:14:43,256
really nice.
I'm gonna find myself.

323
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:44,928
You have new music?

324
00:14:45,236 --> 00:14:46,225
Yeah.

325
00:14:47,071 --> 00:14:48,436
Definitely.

326
00:14:59,017 --> 00:15:00,041
See you!

327
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:01,210
Bye!

328
00:15:03,054 --> 00:15:04,282
Thanks.

329
00:15:05,657 --> 00:15:06,954
Yes!
We did it.

330
00:15:07,025 --> 00:15:11,223
We got it! I mean, we got it! We
nailed it! Nailed it! Come here. Yes!

331
00:15:12,297 --> 00:15:14,697
I am really thrilled.

332
00:15:29,681 --> 00:15:30,739
Let's go.

333
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,009
What?
Let's go.

334
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:35,246
Going... Okay. Where're
we going? Doesn't matter.

335
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:37,616
Going to the go-go.

336
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,882
Okay.

337
00:15:50,152 --> 00:15:51,380
Michael?

338
00:15:59,995 --> 00:16:01,223
Michael?

339
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,928
Michael?

340
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:14,735
His car's
not in the parking lot.

341
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,869
I should check
the accident reports.

342
00:16:19,748 --> 00:16:21,113
Who's this?

343
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:23,443
Jan.

344
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:45,033
Good morning, Pam.

345
00:16:46,442 --> 00:16:47,636
Hey.

346
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:50,774
No, nothing happened.

347
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:55,949
I swear. Nothing happened.

348
00:16:56,285 --> 00:16:59,846
What?
I'm totally being serious.

349
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:05,088
A gentleman does not kiss
and tell. And neither do I.

350
00:17:07,463 --> 00:17:08,623
No, seriously, guys,
I'm not...

351
00:17:08,697 --> 00:17:11,495
I don't want to go
into it at all.

352
00:17:12,668 --> 00:17:14,295
It's off-limits.

353
00:17:15,704 --> 00:17:19,367
Fine. I took her back to her hotel
and we made out for a little while.

354
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:21,534
It was great. I mean, she
told me about her divorce,

355
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,077
we talked
for about five hours,

356
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:25,579
she fell asleep
on my arm, so...

357
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,212
Hello, Dwight.

358
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:33,413
Did you do her?

359
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,679
Who?

360
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,258
Jan Levinson-Gould.

361
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,359
No, no. No Gould.

362
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,419
Did you do her?

363
00:17:42,498 --> 00:17:44,489
This is none of your affair.

364
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:45,590
Because she is your boss...

365
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:46,691
And she is your boss.

366
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:48,031
And she is a woman.

367
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:51,630
She is a strong,
soft, thoughtful,

368
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,031
sexy woman.

369
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:56,601
And you know what?
I don't think I can sit here

370
00:17:56,678 --> 00:18:00,808
and let you talk about her that
way without me defending her honor.

371
00:18:00,883 --> 00:18:02,908
Jan, I defend your honor.

372
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:05,052
Is that all?

373
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:12,589
Jan didn't come back
for her car last night.

374
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:13,753
What?

375
00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:16,624
Could it be
that Agent Michael Scarn

376
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:18,393
has finally found
his Catherine Zeta?

377
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:20,094
Oh, I don't know.

378
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,564
Oh, my God.
This is Jan's cell.

379
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,629
No way.

380
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:28,602
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

381
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:31,207
I know we have to register

382
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,408
as a consensual sexual
relationship with HR.

383
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:37,509
My question,
do I do it as the man?

384
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:40,714
Does she do it as my superior?
I don't know.

385
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:44,748
That leads to other issues that
we may have in our relationship.

386
00:18:45,194 --> 00:18:47,185
It's... Excuse me.

387
00:18:47,796 --> 00:18:48,854
Hello?

388
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:51,399
Hi. Just talking about you.

389
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:53,695
To the camera? No.

390
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:54,858
Uh-huh.

391
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:58,538
How's traffic?
I miss you. What?

392
00:18:59,942 --> 00:19:01,034
Okay.

393
00:19:03,045 --> 00:19:07,004
Well, if it was a mistake,
it was a wonderful mistake.

394
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,719
No. Could you just...

395
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:16,288
No, I did not intentionally
get you drunk.

396
00:19:18,627 --> 00:19:19,616
Mmm-hmm.

397
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:21,790
No, no.

398
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,291
This is just a fight.

399
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:27,995
This is just the first of many
fights we're going to have.

400
00:19:28,303 --> 00:19:29,497
Right.

401
00:19:30,405 --> 00:19:31,429
No!

402
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:35,410
See, you... I don't understand.
You want to see other people?

403
00:19:35,477 --> 00:19:37,468
Only other people? Why?

404
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:40,043
Okay, I think you're
still a little bit drunk.

405
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:41,912
Excuse me. Excuse me?

406
00:19:43,252 --> 00:19:46,653
I think you're... Yes, why
don't you just come back here?

407
00:19:46,722 --> 00:19:49,316
We can go to the hotel,
have a few drinks.

408
00:19:49,391 --> 00:19:51,723
No, I didn't slip you
something.

409
00:19:52,127 --> 00:19:55,221
Some might even say we had
our first date last night.

410
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:56,821
Oh, really?
Really.

411
00:19:56,899 --> 00:19:58,662
Why might some say that?

412
00:19:58,734 --> 00:20:01,100
'Cause there was dinner
by candlelight.

413
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:02,158
Mmm-hmm.

414
00:20:02,271 --> 00:20:05,502
Dinner and a show, if you
include Michael's movie.

415
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:09,840
And there was dancing and
fireworks. Pretty good date.

416
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:11,504
We didn't dance.

417
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:16,041
You're right. We didn't dance.
It was more like swaying.

418
00:20:17,152 --> 00:20:18,585
But it's still romantic.

419
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:20,315
Swaying isn't dancing.

420
00:20:22,658 --> 00:20:25,821
At least I didn't leave you
at a high school hockey game.

421
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:33,194
I have some faxes to get out.

422
00:20:35,337 --> 00:20:37,202
Oh, come on, Pam. I...

423
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,405
Okay, we didn't dance.

424
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:43,369
And I was totally joking,
anyway. I mean...

425
00:20:44,012 --> 00:20:47,709
It's not really a date if the
girl goes home to her fiance.

426
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:49,643
Right?
