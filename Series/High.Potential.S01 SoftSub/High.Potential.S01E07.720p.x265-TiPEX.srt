1
00:00:21,124 --> 00:00:23,230
Hey!

2
00:00:23,954 --> 00:00:25,646
- Go, go!
- Come on, guys. Don"t do that.

3
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:28,752
Freaking kids.

4
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,151
Hello?

5
00:01:04,443 --> 00:01:06,204
There are three borders in Africa.

6
00:01:06,342 --> 00:01:08,102
Not if you station all your troops in Egypt.

7
00:01:08,896 --> 00:01:10,587
What do you think?

8
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:12,765
- Totally.
- Can I have a yes day if I win tonight?

9
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,265
Give me a minute with your brother?

10
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:16,466
Wait, no. You guys could
be arguing about it for hours.

11
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,410
All right. Yeah, we"ll
do a yes day if you win.

12
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:21,633
- You"re my witness.
- Elliot. If you are trying to employ

13
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:24,498
the Russian"s strategy during
the patriotic war of 1812

14
00:01:24,636 --> 00:01:26,707
- I am.
- Well, then you"re making a big mistake.

15
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:30,814
Napoleon led 630,000
strong into Russia,

16
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:34,853
not realizing he"d been drawn into the
perfect trap by Alexander the blessed.

17
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:36,924
Elliot, you child.

18
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:41,101
You"re conflating a real war with a
game of plastic men and cardboard.

19
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,723
- How so?
- Here it comes.

20
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:45,046
Well, once you take away
insufficient access to resources

21
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,383
and the strategic efforts
of the French military

22
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:50,144
and you distill it all down to
which continent on the board

23
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:52,191
would be the best place
to gather all of your troops,

24
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:53,855
you"ll only come up with one conclusion,

25
00:01:54,183 --> 00:01:55,183
- Australia.
- Australia.

26
00:01:57,358 --> 00:01:58,566
I win.

27
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:02,950
Nicely done, young lady.

28
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:05,031
Yeah, that was way off.
How did we let this happen?

29
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:06,229
I mean...

30
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:09,622
Listen, I was in a Northern
Europe kinda mood, and you"re ten.

31
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:12,699
So, as I roll my way
to world domination...

32
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:13,202
My...

33
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,540
Mom, you"re off work tomorrow, right?
Because I have big plans for our yes day.

34
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,139
All right.

35
00:02:23,695 --> 00:02:26,135
I know you probably think my
itinerary for today is too much.

36
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:28,044
Well, it"s pretty.

37
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,360
"Visit mom" s work, venice
beach, the pier, the grove,

38
00:02:33,498 --> 00:02:35,672
saks fifth Avenue, rodeo drive."

39
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,881
Okay. It"s a yes day, right? Not a week.

40
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:40,194
"We only have today. Let us begin."

41
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:44,854
- Someone famous said that, right?
- Yeah. Yeah. Mother Teresa.

42
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:47,167
- Yeah.
- Okay. Let"s do it.

43
00:02:51,032 --> 00:02:53,759
So, if you calm down, I can
understand you much better.

44
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:58,074
- If I can just...
- just a minute.

45
00:02:58,212 --> 00:02:59,662
Yes, you"ll have to calm down.

46
00:03:01,111 --> 00:03:04,391
Buddy, I Don"t even know if we can
afford to use the bathrooms at saks.

47
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:05,530
Mom, trust.

48
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:09,855
Twice a year, saks offers free makeovers
to the first 25 people who sign up,

49
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,305
but it"s incredibly hard to get on the list.

50
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:12,537
And we"re on this list?

51
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:13,710
We"re on the list.

52
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:18,174
Were any rules broken to get on this
list? Because I do work for the police now.

53
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,372
Elliot did some computer
stuff and made it happen.

54
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,857
I promised to save up and
get him a calculator in return.

55
00:03:24,963 --> 00:03:26,323
I have a package for major crimes.

56
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:28,043
I"m so sorry. He gets excited

57
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:29,657
my god. He"s so cute.

58
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:31,532
Cancel all our plans.
I have to pet that guy.

59
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:33,765
- Okay. Well, hang on.
- Hey. Yes day.

60
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,219
I kind of assumed
that the phone number

61
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:41,048
written with cheesy fingers was yours.

62
00:03:41,773 --> 00:03:44,362
Well, maybe if you had
called it, you would know.

63
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,261
- I did call.
- Did you?

64
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:49,988
Yeah. A woman named
edna picked up the phone.

65
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:51,472
Nice lady.

66
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,441
76-year-old bowling buff
with plenty of stories to tell.

67
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:58,099
Well, lucky edna. Sounds
like you"re a good listener.

68
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,790
I"m decent.

69
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,461
Yeah. Maybe next time I"ll try
writing with something other than food.

70
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:05,624
No. It totally worked out.

71
00:04:07,108 --> 00:04:08,672
Edna invited me to her bowling
league tomorrow night, the gutter gals.

72
00:04:08,696 --> 00:04:09,801
- No.
- Yes.

73
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:13,045
Now, I could see if I
could bring a plus-one.

74
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,568
Are you asking me out on a date with
a bunch of old ladies who like to bowl?

75
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:21,744
- I think I am.
- I"m 100% in.

76
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:26,266
- Mom, we have to get a dog.
- No.

77
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:27,404
Cute kid.

78
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:31,512
Yeah. Caught her stealing again,
so time to press formal charges.

79
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,275
Smart. Never too early
to scare "em straight."

80
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:39,589
- See ya.
- See ya.

81
00:04:43,938 --> 00:04:46,596
Yeah. Right outside my
apartment. He just came at me.

82
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:48,633
- You got a look at the guy?
- Yeah.

83
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:50,669
This is called the bullpen.

84
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:52,207
That "s Daphne. She" s my favorite.

85
00:04:52,637 --> 00:04:53,637
My daughter.

86
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,191
Hi.

87
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,298
I feel like this tour should
include some snacks.

88
00:04:58,436 --> 00:04:59,885
Yeah. Let"s see what you got.

89
00:05:00,023 --> 00:05:03,095
I"ll have... Anything but the yogurt.

90
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:06,074
Those are lieutenant soto"s, and I
Don"t wanna mess with her probiotics.

91
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,652
It wasn"t my stash, man.

92
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,102
- Whoa.
- Okay. Save it for the judge. Let"s go.

93
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:14,693
Morgan, I thought you were off today.

94
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:17,351
I am off today. I"m just
showing my kid around.

95
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:18,663
And this is Ava.

96
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:19,836
Yeah. You remembered.

97
00:05:19,974 --> 00:05:21,148
Yeah. How could I forget?

98
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,805
What a fun surprise.

99
00:05:24,496 --> 00:05:27,406
It"s a yes day. So, anything Ava says
she wants to do, I have to say yes to it.

100
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,502
Okay. I see. Well, in that case,
all laws still apply, young lady.

101
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:35,236
- Where"s your desk?
- I Don"t have a desk.

102
00:05:37,198 --> 00:05:40,005
We"re gonna go drop this perp off
downstairs and then question a witness,

103
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:41,030
but enjoy your day off.

104
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:42,248
Good to see you again, Ava.

105
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:44,516
So, everyone has a desk but you?

106
00:05:44,654 --> 00:05:47,416
I Don"t need a desk. I kinda pop
around and help everybody out.

107
00:05:47,554 --> 00:05:50,211
Right. "Cause you" re just so
smart, everyone needs your help.

108
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:54,157
- I mean...
- Okay. I"m going to the restroom.

109
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:56,494
Okay. It"s right down the hall and then...

110
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:58,737
You are a teenager and
you already know everything.

111
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:02,879
I understand. Yeah, I didn"t know.

112
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:05,641
Yeah. Well, for now
on, you have to tell me...

113
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:11,426
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you bet.

114
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:25,361
- Blue eyes. That"s helpful.
- Actually, they were brown.

115
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,385
Everybody, stay put!

116
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:27,732
What?

117
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,870
Don"t do that.

118
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,251
Don"t do that!

119
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,022
Forget everything
you"ve been trained to do,

120
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:34,083
otherwise that box right over there

121
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:36,223
goes boom.

122
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,122
And that"s just the one you can see.

123
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,780
There are others in this
building that are there

124
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:44,404
to keep your brothers and
sisters in blue at bay. Understood?

125
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:55,963
Get over there with the rest of them.

126
00:06:57,658 --> 00:06:59,384
You too. Get up.

127
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:01,386
Not you. Stay. Sit down.

128
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:04,216
Stay there. I"ve got a job for you.

129
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:07,944
No!

130
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:12,708
No more of that from anybody. Got it?

131
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:15,089
Weapons, phones...

132
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,782
Now.

133
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,955
Now!

134
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,750
Pull your weapon.

135
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:23,926
Weapon. Hurry up.

136
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:26,307
Hey, phone!

137
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:29,966
You too.

138
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:33,763
The people in this room stay.

139
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:36,701
Everyone else in the building has
two minutes to leave. Make the call.

140
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,943
This is detective Daphne forrester.

141
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:42,841
We have a report of
bombs in the building.

142
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:44,809
Requesting immediate evacuation.

143
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,950
Move. Over there. Now.

144
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:14,148
I know you"re all scared and
wondering why we"re here, so I"ll tell you.

145
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:19,499
An innocent man is about to spend his life
in prison for a murder he did not commit.

146
00:08:19,637 --> 00:08:22,191
We"re here to do for him what
we know he would do for us.

147
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:25,366
Which gives you a second
chance to find the real killer.

148
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,990
Nobody walks out of
here alive unless you do.

149
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:32,719
So, who"s your best detective?

150
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,345
I am.

151
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:48,113
Get an officer on every exit!

152
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:52,428
Open the Charlie side!

153
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,295
Quickly!

154
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:01,368
Go to the east side!

155
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:06,235
No one"s answering.

156
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:09,628
It"s only been 27 minutes.
Keep calling until we get through.

157
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:10,757
- Hey.
- What"s going on?

158
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:13,839
Two people entered the precinct
and announced they had bombs.

159
00:09:13,863 --> 00:09:16,694
We evacuated the building,
but they have hostages.

160
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:19,386
These are my detectives,
karadec and oz.

161
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:20,644
SWAT captain cliff halloway.

162
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:23,918
My team has already cleared
the area and secured the perimeter.

163
00:09:23,942 --> 00:09:25,575
- What about the hostages?
- We think at least a dozen

164
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,681
based on our tally of who
went in but hasn"t come out.

165
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:29,258
A few members of the public,

166
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:32,226
but mostly our own people
in the major crimes bullpen.

167
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,172
We have all the exits covered, and we"re
staging at various points of advantage.

168
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:37,518
Any idea who we"re dealing with here?

169
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,382
They signed into the building
using their own names,

170
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:41,442
and we got their files from army cid.

171
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:46,447
Staff sergeant Brooke kirkman, 32,
from Bakersfield. No known priors.

172
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,071
Same for sergeant Jeremy
Davis from Colorado.

173
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:52,453
Both served together in the us
army until Davis transferred last year

174
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,397
- to the national guard.
- So they"re trained.

175
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:57,182
So is my team. We"ll be prepared
to handle them if it comes to that.

176
00:09:57,251 --> 00:09:58,884
How did they get
explosives past security?

177
00:09:58,908 --> 00:10:00,437
We"re still trying to figure that out.

178
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:02,232
We haven"t been able to
talk to anybody on the inside.

179
00:10:02,256 --> 00:10:05,052
But we did tap into our
security system and found this.

180
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:08,584
What happened to the
cameras in the bullpen?

181
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,608
They blew them up.

182
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:13,796
I"ll get eyes on them as soon as
my guys are in position of the roof.

183
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,581
Good. But remember, our primary
goal is the safety of those hostages.

184
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,548
Of course.

185
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:21,127
Let"s try to keep the media
out of this as long as possible.

186
00:10:22,518 --> 00:10:23,518
It"s melon.

187
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:27,661
This is lieutenant soto with the
LAPD. Who am I speaking with?

188
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:31,044
<i>"Staff sergeant Logan
hanson is an innocent man."</i>

189
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,874
Charged with a crime he did not commit.

190
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:37,084
The LAPD got it wrong.

191
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:40,847
Today, they have one
chance... To make it right

192
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:44,195
"or everyone in here will die."

193
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,093
<i>Is everyone there all right?</i>

194
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:51,028
Stop.

195
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,964
- Done.
- Go.

196
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:57,864
Lead the way.

197
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:00,660
Did she make it out? Ava?

198
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:05,112
Yeah. She had to. The whole
building was evacuated, right?

199
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:11,878
What are they thinking?

200
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:13,925
That if they can prove
Logan hanson is innocent,

201
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:15,685
maybe he goes free and
they only do a little time.

202
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,263
- Who worked the case?
- Detective lavely. Get him here now.

203
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:20,507
- Yeah.
- Has lavely ever got one wrong before?

204
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:22,534
Not in the 20 years I"ve known him.

205
00:11:39,837 --> 00:11:41,597
- Detective lavely.
- Lieutenant soto.

206
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:44,334
- This about the frank Webber murder?
- I need to know everything.

207
00:11:44,358 --> 00:11:45,601
I arrested Logan hanson myself.

208
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,683
Last I checked he was
locked up in men"s central.

209
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,399
Da thinks he"ll get 25 to life.
It"s an open-and-shut case.

210
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:53,505
- Not according to those who knew him.
- You checking my work now?

211
00:11:53,643 --> 00:11:56,646
If it keeps the people inside from
getting caught in a cross fire, yes.

212
00:11:56,785 --> 00:11:59,753
Because right now our only chance
of resolving this situation peacefully

213
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:02,583
- is to prove Logan hanson was innocent.
- And if he isn"t?

214
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,932
Then this situation will get a lot
more dangerous than it already is.

215
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,796
Frances Webber, 62.

216
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:10,626
He was a retired master sergeant
who returned as a contractor

217
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:13,491
to teach at joint forces
training base, los alamitos.

218
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:14,629
The guy was a legend.

219
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:16,908
Trained generations
of soldiers in the army.

220
00:12:20,084 --> 00:12:21,948
- Did you find it?
- We found it.

221
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:26,297
Webber was found dead last
week when a runner spotted his rv

222
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:28,309
in a park in palos verdes
with the door kicked in.

223
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,373
I remember this case.
Shot with his own gun, right?

224
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:31,958
One to the chest.

225
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:40,173
You recovered the weapon?

226
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:42,796
In a trash can. Less than
a mile from the scene.

227
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:44,134
Killer tried to wipe it clean,

228
00:12:45,316 --> 00:12:46,569
but we were still able to lift
solid partials from the barrel.

229
00:12:46,593 --> 00:12:48,457
- Both a match to Logan.
- And acetone?

230
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:50,770
Which Logan was using
in a home Reno project.

231
00:12:56,983 --> 00:12:58,961
Report says the trajectory
of the bullet"s consistent

232
00:12:58,985 --> 00:13:00,814
with a shooter about
six foot, maybe 6 "1"?

233
00:13:00,952 --> 00:13:01,952
Logan"s height.

234
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,691
Witnesses placed Logan and
frank at a bar together in long beach

235
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:07,866
- the night before murder.
- Bartender reported they seemed tense.

236
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,790
- What is it?
- It"s a transcript of the interrogation.

237
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,137
Read it.

238
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:16,450
He waived <i>Miranda.</i>

239
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,316
Blah-blah-blah. Blah-blah-blah.

240
00:13:20,454 --> 00:13:23,043
"Where were you Tuesday night?"

241
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,289
I was with my girlfriend Brooke.

242
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:29,360
You two were home alone?

243
00:13:29,498 --> 00:13:31,189
<i>No calls, no visitors. Right?</i>

244
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,365
- Alibi?
- Brooke confirmed the alibi, but

245
00:13:34,503 --> 00:13:36,539
girlfriends never lie.

246
00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:40,336
Our investigation found that Logan
was up for a prestigious overseas post.

247
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:42,787
Logan claimed he turned it down.

248
00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:44,824
I"ve given my life to the service,

249
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,067
but I wanted a life of my own.

250
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:50,174
A life with Brooke.

251
00:13:51,796 --> 00:13:54,419
"And what did frank Webber
think of that decision?"

252
00:13:54,937 --> 00:13:57,491
Or frank told Logan he was
being passed over for the post,

253
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,629
which sent Logan into a
rage, and he killed frank.

254
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,187
So, Logan has motive, no reliable
alibi, and his prints are on the gun.

255
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:06,017
Like I said, case closed.

256
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:09,710
But Logan claimed he and frank went
to the shooting range the day before.

257
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,448
And claimed frank let him his use
his gun to explain away the prints.

258
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:14,432
Delusional hostage takers
are the most dangerous.

259
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:16,623
But the pair inside are
convinced Logan is innocent,

260
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,340
it "s unlikely they" ll listen to reason.

261
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,068
Neutralizing the targets may be the
only way to protect those hostages.

262
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:24,864
Look.

263
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:29,247
I wish I could say there
was something they missed.

264
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:31,801
- Better do more than wish.
- It"s all here.

265
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:34,563
I Don"t see...

266
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:36,945
Lavely and his team
did a very thorough job.

267
00:14:38,084 --> 00:14:39,602
I"ve given my life to the service.

268
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,300
All the evidence still points to Logan.

269
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:42,398
Wrong answer.

270
00:14:42,536 --> 00:14:43,536
Try again.

271
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:46,920
I wanted a life of my
own. A life with Brooke.

272
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:49,267
- I think...
- think fast

273
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:51,545
- excuse me.
- Who are you?

274
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,927
- You a cop?
- No. I"m a consultant.

275
00:14:54,065 --> 00:14:57,413
Listen. Lieutenant melon, he"s right.

276
00:14:57,551 --> 00:15:00,382
All the evidence does point to
Logan, but something"s missing.

277
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:07,422
Keep talking.

278
00:15:09,115 --> 00:15:11,255
Look. Okay, do you see the blood?

279
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:14,914
Look at the blood. Look where it stops.

280
00:15:15,052 --> 00:15:18,262
That"s a perfect corner. Something
was there when frank was killed.

281
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:20,412
And then gone before the police arrived.

282
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,714
That"s right. A piece
of paper or something.

283
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:25,234
Whatever it was, the killer
wanted to take it with them,

284
00:15:25,372 --> 00:15:26,492
and we gotta figure out why.

285
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,000
I gotta make a phone call.

286
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:35,796
- This is soto.
<i>- Hey, lieutenant.</i>

287
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,490
- Morgan.
<i>- Yeah, I am just in here helping out.</i>

288
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:41,019
Hey, can I talk to karadec, please?

289
00:15:41,043 --> 00:15:42,769
<i>"Yeah, Morgan, I" m
here. Are you all right?</i>

290
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:46,324
Yep, I"m okay. What about you?
Are you enjoying your yes day?

291
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,120
Ava"s not with her.

292
00:15:49,258 --> 00:15:51,536
Get all officers looking
for her outside the building.

293
00:15:52,296 --> 00:15:54,056
We"re gonna look for
a reason to celebrate.

294
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:56,886
Hey. Stop messing around.

295
00:15:57,508 --> 00:15:59,708
- Listen, I need... I need an assist.
<i>- How can I help?</i>

296
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:01,719
Is frank"s rv still in impound?

297
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:03,100
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

298
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:07,943
- What kind of paper?
<i>- We"re not sure yet.</i>

299
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,659
But wh-whatever it is, it
could help us find frank"s killer.

300
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:16,906
- Like, something he printed?
- Yeah. I... Maybe. I Don"t know.

301
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:20,358
I think I have a desktop. Hold on.

302
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:29,333
Looks like the last thing frank
opened on his computer was a form.

303
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:31,369
<i>Dd form 458.</i>

304
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:32,715
It"s a charge form.

305
00:16:32,853 --> 00:16:34,813
Brings a soldier in front
of a military tribunal.

306
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:36,892
- Frank was gonna write up a soldier.
- No way.

307
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,750
<i>"Which could" ve
resulted in his discharge.</i>

308
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:40,630
It couldn"t have been Logan. He
was a model soldier in every way.

309
00:16:40,654 --> 00:16:43,347
Okay, so if staying in the
army wasn "t Logan" s motive,

310
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:45,038
then maybe it was somebody else"s.

311
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,834
- Who"s there?
- What"s going on?

312
00:16:47,972 --> 00:16:50,112
Show me your hands
now or I start shooting!

313
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:55,428
Come here.

314
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,431
Give me that.

315
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:00,433
My god!

316
00:17:00,571 --> 00:17:01,882
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

317
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,505
Whoa! You got something to say?

318
00:17:05,403 --> 00:17:08,234
Seems to me you"ve got bigger worries

319
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:11,823
than a mother hugging her daughter,
considering the situation we are in.

320
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:16,587
So, yeah, I had something
to say, and I said it.

321
00:17:17,864 --> 00:17:19,521
All right. It"s okay.

322
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:21,247
I got him.

323
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,732
Both of you, come sit down now.

324
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:43,762
Lauren, we are sorry to
have to drag you into all of this

325
00:17:43,786 --> 00:17:45,109
about your father, frank,
but we really need your help.

326
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:47,076
Can you think of anyone
your dad had an issue with?

327
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,460
Maybe someone he was planning
on writing up for misconduct.

328
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:51,311
If there was, he wouldn"t have told me.

329
00:17:51,932 --> 00:17:54,383
He believed his role was to
support and protect his soldiers.

330
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:56,913
That meant guarding their
privacy like it was a national secret.

331
00:17:56,937 --> 00:17:58,905
He took his responsibilities seriously.

332
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:02,805
He was more than just a superior officer.
He was like a father to those guys.

333
00:18:02,943 --> 00:18:04,749
That must have been
hard, having to share him.

334
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:07,431
I didn"t mind. He always
made sure we got time together.

335
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:10,779
No matter what he had going on, he
came over for dinner every Monday.

336
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:12,574
6:00 to 8:00. Like clockwork.

337
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:14,952
The Monday before he died,
did anything seem off to you?

338
00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:19,305
I wish that I could tell you.

339
00:18:19,443 --> 00:18:22,446
But last Monday was actually the
first dinner he canceled in years.

340
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:23,757
Did he tell you why?

341
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,484
He just said that he had
something he needed to do,

342
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:30,109
that he loved me and
he"d make it up to me.

343
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:37,599
I"ve got no eyes outside,
no clue what"s going on.

344
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:42,811
Mom, I tried to do what
you said. I really tried.

345
00:18:42,949 --> 00:18:44,996
I tried to get out. I"m
sorry. I couldn"t leave you.

346
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,260
Baby, listen to me. It"s okay.

347
00:18:46,332 --> 00:18:47,930
I"m not gonna let
anything happen to you.

348
00:18:47,954 --> 00:18:48,954
- Okay.
- It"s okay.

349
00:18:49,024 --> 00:18:50,163
Shh.

350
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:51,475
Answer it.

351
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:57,446
<i>This is detective karadec.
Can I speak with Morgan, please</i>

352
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:01,069
what do you got?

353
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:05,568
Hello, Brooke. Frank missed a dinner with
his daughter the Monday before he died.

354
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:07,042
Do we have any idea where he went?

355
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,951
<i>"No, his car doesn" t
have a navigation system,</i>

356
00:19:08,975 --> 00:19:10,608
<i>but his cell phone should
be inside that evidence box.</i>

357
00:19:10,632 --> 00:19:11,633
You.

358
00:19:13,048 --> 00:19:15,154
I"ll be right back. Okay?

359
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:16,948
I got it.

360
00:19:18,018 --> 00:19:20,366
His password is my birthday, 9484.

361
00:19:20,504 --> 00:19:22,437
<i>- You hear that?</i>
- Yep.

362
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:25,612
Got it. Monday evening
looks like, at 5:47 P.M.,

363
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,545
he looked up an address
near 4th and spring.

364
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:29,523
- That"s pershing square.
- Back when I was in vice,

365
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:31,860
we"d catch drugs,
prostitution there every night.

366
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:33,689
My... my father would never.

367
00:19:33,827 --> 00:19:34,827
He didn"t even drink.

368
00:19:36,071 --> 00:19:38,049
At my wedding, he had sparkling
apple juice instead of champagne.

369
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:39,292
Wait. Frank input a second
address 40 minutes later.

370
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:41,559
1487 north east man Avenue.

371
00:19:43,527 --> 00:19:45,367
It"s a private detox
center in boyle heights.

372
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:47,703
So, frank picked someone up
downtown and got them help?

373
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:48,877
I told you.

374
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,821
My father treated his team like
family. He would do anything for them.

375
00:19:51,845 --> 00:19:54,054
"kay, he only made
one phone call that night.

376
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,299
It was to a Lauren Webber.
And the call didn"t go through.

377
00:19:58,127 --> 00:19:59,819
I

378
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:02,649
I turn my phone off when I
sleep. He must"ve tried to call me.

379
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:05,180
We"re gonna find out what
happened that night. I promise you.

380
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,596
I"m gonna call the facility now,
find out who frank dropped off.

381
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,865
Good. Oz, look into the personnel
files of anyone frank was training.

382
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,695
See if one pings on a prior drug charge.

383
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:14,833
Yeah. On it.

384
00:20:21,427 --> 00:20:23,222
<i>Star community detox.</i>

385
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,200
Yeah, this is detective
karadec with the LAPD.

386
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:27,719
You guys had a patient dropped
off there Monday about 7:00 P.M.

387
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:30,436
<i>I "m sorry, but I" m not allowed
to provide any information.</i>

388
00:20:30,574 --> 00:20:32,586
I understand, but this
patient might"ve killed a man.

389
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,268
<i>I still can"t provide you a
name. I have a responsibility</i>

390
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:37,384
listen, I know you are
just trying to do your job.

391
00:20:37,408 --> 00:20:38,799
But you could be protecting a murderer

392
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:40,791
and putting the lives
of my entire team at risk.

393
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:42,827
<i>I hope everyone is okay.</i>

394
00:20:42,965 --> 00:20:43,965
Hello?

395
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:47,498
- We"ll get a warrant.
- We Don"t have time.

396
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:48,971
I"m on the phone with the da.

397
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,320
Come here.

398
00:20:57,497 --> 00:20:59,637
- Something"s not right.
- Yeah, you need to relax.

399
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,087
You"re not listening to me.

400
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:03,813
Hey.

401
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,818
I can take him. Can you two take her?

402
00:21:07,956 --> 00:21:10,786
Fast enough to stop her
from triggering that bomb?

403
00:21:10,924 --> 00:21:12,271
I"m fast, but not that fast.

404
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:17,897
All she has to do is press that button.

405
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:20,279
I Don"t think she will.

406
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:25,353
I got a bad feeling, okay?

407
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:28,632
Relax. The police do not want
people to die. They will get the warrant.

408
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:32,291
When? Tomorrow? All while
they"re making moves out there?

409
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:34,293
Hey. Stick to the plan.

410
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:37,330
Logan goes free, and
nobody gets hurt, right?

411
00:21:37,468 --> 00:21:40,368
I Don"t trust cops.
And neither should you.

412
00:21:41,438 --> 00:21:42,577
They"re planning something.

413
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,132
I know it.

414
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:54,658
Nobody move!

415
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,454
Come on!

416
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:09,535
Jeremy!

417
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:27,656
SWAT"s almost in position.

418
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:30,866
<i>Shots fired.</i>

419
00:22:31,004 --> 00:22:32,564
- Are you sure about that?
<i>- Confirmed.</i>

420
00:22:33,248 --> 00:22:34,939
I just got reports of a shot fired.

421
00:22:35,077 --> 00:22:36,562
From inside the bullpen?

422
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,333
- That "s what I" m hearing.
- We have eyes in there yet?

423
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,357
Almost.

424
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,267
My team is on standby,
lieutenant. Just give the word.

425
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,856
We have to give Morgan more
time. Just hold off a little bit longer.

426
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,434
Until when? We hear another gunshot?

427
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:47,987
Would you rather hear a bomb?

428
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,365
If we spook them, things
can go south real fast, Selena.

429
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:51,577
- Lieutenant?
- Hey!

430
00:22:53,095 --> 00:22:55,350
Those are our people in there. They
know what they"re doing. Do you?

431
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,814
- All right! Enough!
- Our guys on the roof lowered a camera.

432
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:03,105
Hey, who"s that on the
ground? Hey, he"s not moving.

433
00:23:06,212 --> 00:23:09,940
People inside are like my family
too. But we can only wait for so long.

434
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,371
- Your team goes on my call.
- No, wait! Lieutenant, right there.

435
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,535
He"s moving. Yeah, right there. See?

436
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:26,508
The gun went off because of
you, okay? Everybody saw it.

437
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:29,408
I know how you cops spin
things, try to pin it on me.

438
00:23:29,546 --> 00:23:30,754
You should"ve listened to us.

439
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:32,100
You okay?

440
00:23:32,238 --> 00:23:33,273
Keep breathing with me.

441
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,699
The bullet must"ve hit an artery.

442
00:23:34,723 --> 00:23:35,723
I need your shirt.

443
00:23:36,656 --> 00:23:37,656
All right.

444
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:41,558
You think this is gonna keep me
from my bowling date with edna?

445
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,421
It might.

446
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:46,699
It"s too bad. I was really
looking forward to it.

447
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,256
Well, then we better both
get out of here in one piece.

448
00:23:50,394 --> 00:23:52,638
That should slow the bleeding.

449
00:23:54,294 --> 00:23:56,296
All right. We just need to elevate my leg

450
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,575
and then check my distal
pulses every three minutes.

451
00:23:59,161 --> 00:24:00,646
Tom"s at night school for nursing.

452
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:02,233
I need a box.

453
00:24:03,303 --> 00:24:04,650
No, what are you doing?

454
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,551
As long as they cooperate, no
one gets killed. That"s what we said.

455
00:24:09,689 --> 00:24:11,795
One, two...

456
00:24:15,143 --> 00:24:16,178
All right.

457
00:24:17,145 --> 00:24:18,145
Let"s lay you down.

458
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,842
- Please.
- Consider it done.

459
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,052
Selena, let"s have unis canvass
any bodegas within walking distance

460
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,670
- of that rehab facility.
- What for?

461
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:31,273
Because if frank
dropped our killer off there,

462
00:24:31,297 --> 00:24:32,930
then the killer probably
doesn"t have a car, right?

463
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:34,552
Patients can come and go,
but every addict I"ve ever known

464
00:24:34,576 --> 00:24:36,578
goes for the same thing every morning.

465
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:38,314
- Coffee and cigarettes.
- Cigarettes and coffee.

466
00:24:38,338 --> 00:24:40,144
And you"re going to these
stores to ask them what exactly?

467
00:24:40,168 --> 00:24:42,481
To ask "em if they saw a
male on Tuesday morning."

468
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:45,770
Six feet tall, military haircut, maybe
looking like he"s jonesing a little bit.

469
00:24:45,794 --> 00:24:47,594
Picking up a cup of Joe
and a pack of smokes.

470
00:24:47,693 --> 00:24:49,867
- Sounds like a long shot.
- You got a better one?

471
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,491
Hurry.

472
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:58,497
We gotta get him to a hospital now.

473
00:24:58,635 --> 00:25:00,291
Nobody"s going anywhere.

474
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:02,822
If this man doesn"t get medical
attention in the next 15 minutes,

475
00:25:02,846 --> 00:25:04,330
he could go into shock and die.

476
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:05,711
How do you know that?

477
00:25:07,022 --> 00:25:09,577
When I became pregnant
with my daughter, I was terrified.

478
00:25:09,715 --> 00:25:12,372
The only thing I wanted in the
entire world was to keep her safe.

479
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,375
I took about a thousand first aid
classes, and I am telling you now,

480
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,894
this man needs medical attention.

481
00:25:17,895 --> 00:25:20,691
Did it help? Taking all those classes?

482
00:25:21,796 --> 00:25:24,436
The second she was born, everything
I learned went out the window.

483
00:25:25,454 --> 00:25:27,560
It"s Ava who taught
me how to be a parent.

484
00:25:31,115 --> 00:25:32,358
Just like your baby will.

485
00:25:32,945 --> 00:25:34,325
What are you talking about?

486
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:39,251
Logan didn"t wanna be stationed overseas
because you two are starting a family.

487
00:25:40,815 --> 00:25:43,714
Prenatal vitamins can
cause dryness of the skin.

488
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:47,476
And the spot where fertility
hormones are injected

489
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:49,755
can become swollen and even painful.

490
00:25:52,412 --> 00:25:54,772
Logan was renovating that
room to be a nursery, wasn"t he?

491
00:25:57,245 --> 00:25:59,568
Look at me. I know you didn"t
mean for anybody to get hurt.

492
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:01,629
It "s okay. You" re just
trying to help the person

493
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,647
who"s gonna be the
father of your kid someday.

494
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,772
Please.

495
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
You"re having a kid?

496
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:13,330
I"m not pregnant, but
Logan and I were trying.

497
00:26:13,468 --> 00:26:14,573
Why didn"t he tell me?

498
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:17,241
I Don "t know why he didn" t
tell you, but why does that matter?

499
00:26:17,265 --> 00:26:18,545
"cause everyone" s lying to me!

500
00:26:18,646 --> 00:26:20,302
No one is lying to you.

501
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:26,377
Update me on that.

502
00:26:26,515 --> 00:26:27,515
Okay.

503
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,120
Tell me you found something.

504
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:32,877
Tuesday, 8:36 A.M. clerk remembers
a blonde grunt about six feet tall

505
00:26:32,901 --> 00:26:35,182
<i>- buying a pack of smokes and a coffee.</i>
- You got a name?

506
00:26:35,317 --> 00:26:38,157
No, but security footage from an
atm by the register got a look at him.

507
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:39,371
Now, it"s not great, but,

508
00:26:40,702 --> 00:26:43,060
but it"s something. Text me
the photo. Good work, detective.

509
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:45,062
Pull up facial recognition.
See if we can ID this guy.

510
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:46,156
Yeah.

511
00:26:50,781 --> 00:26:51,781
What?

512
00:26:54,682 --> 00:26:56,131
Wait. Is that a field jacket?

513
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:00,879
You think he"s a friend of theirs?

514
00:27:01,274 --> 00:27:02,310
Worth a try.

515
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:14,908
My god.

516
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:17,566
You gonna get that?

517
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:25,540
- They might"ve solved the whole thing.
- Shut up.

518
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:30,994
<i>This is lieutenant soto.</i>

519
00:27:31,132 --> 00:27:33,755
We"ll be sending you a
photo of someone with no ID.

520
00:27:33,893 --> 00:27:35,308
<i>We wanna know if you recognize him.</i>

521
00:27:36,137 --> 00:27:37,207
9484.

522
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,661
That"s it? That"s what
we"ve been waiting for?

523
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,697
A blurry photo of some random nobody?

524
00:27:45,974 --> 00:27:47,527
We"re doing everything that we...

525
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,718
Hey, if he dies, you"re gonna
go away for first-degree homicide.

526
00:27:54,742 --> 00:27:56,882
I told you to shut up!

527
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,471
- Hey, soldier, focus.
- Do you see what"s going on?

528
00:28:00,609 --> 00:28:03,785
They"re never gonna tell the truth
about what"s happened in here.

529
00:28:03,923 --> 00:28:05,418
- We"re on our own.
- You need to remember

530
00:28:05,442 --> 00:28:07,755
what we"re doing here,
who we are here for.

531
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:10,378
The man who saved your life
is behind enemy lines right now.

532
00:28:10,516 --> 00:28:12,138
And he needs you to keep your cool.

533
00:28:13,864 --> 00:28:16,004
I witnessed everything. I got you.

534
00:28:16,142 --> 00:28:18,731
Got me? You"re in it just as deep.

535
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:22,562
They"re playing us, Brooke, until
they turn the tables and shut this down.

536
00:28:23,391 --> 00:28:24,875
I won"t stop.

537
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:29,166
I will not stop investigating until I
find the real killer. I promise you.

538
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,640
But we have got to get Tom to a hospital.

539
00:28:32,987 --> 00:28:35,265
No. No. No.

540
00:28:35,403 --> 00:28:36,603
Jeremy, he doesn"t look good.

541
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,164
I have seen worse.

542
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:40,511
We said no one gets hurt.

543
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:42,213
What are you, best
friends with her now?

544
00:28:42,237 --> 00:28:45,896
Brooke, he can"t get out
of here by himself though.

545
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,555
He needs somebody to take him.

546
00:28:54,387 --> 00:28:55,387
You.

547
00:28:56,493 --> 00:28:57,528
You, walk him out.

548
00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:02,257
With all due respect, lieutenant,
we have to follow protocol.

549
00:29:02,395 --> 00:29:03,776
Shots fired changes the game.

550
00:29:03,914 --> 00:29:05,778
They had plenty of
time to listen to reason.

551
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:07,849
Hold on. Something"s happening.

552
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:13,475
Okay.

553
00:29:13,613 --> 00:29:15,408
What am I supposed to do? I Don"t...

554
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,031
Listen to me, okay?

555
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:19,388
When... When that elevator"s
open, and you go out the door,

556
00:29:19,412 --> 00:29:22,933
I want you to open it slowly, and you"re
just gonna keep your hands up in the air.

557
00:29:23,451 --> 00:29:24,970
No, I can "t do... I can" t do it.

558
00:29:25,108 --> 00:29:27,800
- Yes, you can.
- I"m not gonna leave you.

559
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:29,560
No... my love.

560
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:34,255
I would never.

561
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:38,614
I would never ask you to do something
that I didn"t know you could do.

562
00:29:38,638 --> 00:29:42,401
You are so strong, and that
man needs your help. Okay?

563
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:44,990
But what if... what if
something happens to you?

564
00:29:45,128 --> 00:29:48,131
Guess what? I"m not going anywhere.

565
00:29:48,683 --> 00:29:51,824
I"m not going anywhere.
Not for a really long time.

566
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:54,102
Certainly not today. Okay?

567
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,829
Okay. Almost there.

568
00:29:56,967 --> 00:30:00,246
Okay. You got it. It"s
okay. We"re almost there.

569
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:02,421
Just a couple more steps. There we go.

570
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:06,596
Okay.

571
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:10,532
Okay. Hey.

572
00:30:13,984 --> 00:30:14,984
That"s my girl.

573
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,207
You care more about
these people than Logan.

574
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:32,037
Don "t say that. It" s not true.

575
00:30:32,175 --> 00:30:34,660
That girl was our insurance policy.

576
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:37,732
There"s no way the cops would risk
her getting hurt, and you let her go.

577
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,045
She was just a kid. I had to.

578
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:43,048
Look, they"re cooperating with
us, and we"re cooperating with them.

579
00:30:43,186 --> 00:30:45,671
You only think that
because you listen to her.

580
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:47,169
She"s blowing the case wide open.

581
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:51,504
She "s not even a cop. We" re not
doing these people any more favors.

582
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:54,266
I took an oath to a fellow
soldier to protect him.

583
00:30:54,404 --> 00:30:58,304
I"m putting my life on the line for
him, and you are turning soft on us.

584
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:00,928
Jeremy, right now, all we need to do

585
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:03,896
do what? Do what?

586
00:31:04,034 --> 00:31:09,143
Sit here like idiots while
they make more phone calls?

587
00:31:11,386 --> 00:31:13,026
What... what are they actually giving us?

588
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:17,876
Nothing. They"re feeding
us worthless intel to buy time.

589
00:31:18,014 --> 00:31:19,291
Why can"t you see that?

590
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:20,948
- There was no phone call.
- Enough!

591
00:31:21,086 --> 00:31:22,604
- If you say...
- let her talk!

592
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:25,107
What do you mean
there was no phone call?

593
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:27,965
I saw frank "s phone. There wasn" t a
phone call that came in on the Monday night

594
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:29,109
he canceled on his daughter.

595
00:31:30,267 --> 00:31:32,667
No incoming call to tell him
to go downtown from the killer.

596
00:31:32,994 --> 00:31:35,583
No text saying that
whoever it was was in trouble.

597
00:31:35,721 --> 00:31:38,241
- Okay, so?
- So, how would frank know where to go?

598
00:31:42,624 --> 00:31:46,490
- What are you trying to find?
- Something I saw. Right here.

599
00:31:46,628 --> 00:31:49,252
Two weeks ago, frank
bought a luggage locator tag.

600
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,230
- What"s that?
- It"s exactly what it sounds like.

601
00:31:51,254 --> 00:31:53,118
- If you lose your luggage...
- stop talking.

602
00:31:54,084 --> 00:31:57,339
Except there was nothing in the phone to
indicate that frank had any travel plans.

603
00:31:57,363 --> 00:31:59,918
- So, what was frank trying to find?
- Not what, who.

604
00:32:00,056 --> 00:32:03,300
Frank wanted to know if the soldier
he cared about was doing drugs.

605
00:32:03,438 --> 00:32:07,132
<i>When he saw that the tag had gone to
a place that was known for selling drugs,</i>

606
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,099
<i>frank drove there to pick him up.</i>

607
00:32:09,237 --> 00:32:11,136
He wasn"t tracking a package.

608
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:16,762
He was tracking a person.

609
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:21,053
Frank must"ve slipped the tag onto
that guy the last time they saw each other.

610
00:32:21,077 --> 00:32:22,319
Exactly.

611
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:24,177
And you really think
that"s gonna help us?

612
00:32:27,428 --> 00:32:30,638
If the person who killed frank
didn"t know he was being tracked,

613
00:32:30,776 --> 00:32:32,674
he might still have the tag on him.

614
00:32:34,849 --> 00:32:37,610
Most tags have an app that keep
a history of where they"ve been.

615
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:41,649
And according to this,
the tag was in frank"s rv

616
00:32:41,787 --> 00:32:43,187
<i>on the date and time of the murder.</i>

617
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:45,273
The killer knew he"d be
dishonorably discharged

618
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:47,379
if frank wrote him up
and exposed his drug use.

619
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:49,968
Yep. And that"s why the
killer took dd form 458,

620
00:32:50,106 --> 00:32:53,454
the one that frank had filled out right
after he shot him with his own gun.

621
00:32:53,592 --> 00:32:55,283
So, who the hell is this guy?

622
00:32:55,421 --> 00:32:57,468
I Don"t know, but I can tell
you where he is right now.

623
00:32:57,492 --> 00:32:59,470
- You can?
- You ready for an address, lieutenant?

624
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:01,807
Yep. <i>- 8700 so la no Avenue.</i>

625
00:33:04,637 --> 00:33:08,158
According to city records, the tag"s
at the residence of Ben spoelstra.

626
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:09,504
Looks like we got our guy.

627
00:33:10,678 --> 00:33:12,266
Was he in military?

628
00:33:12,404 --> 00:33:15,959
Let"s see. Army reserve,
private, currently on temporary duty

629
00:33:16,097 --> 00:33:19,825
at joint forces training base, los alamitos.

630
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:22,083
- Where frank taught.
- Hey, guys? He"s on the move.

631
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:42,502
Freeze!

632
00:33:43,504 --> 00:33:45,206
LAPD! Do not move!
On the ground right now!

633
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,128
- Do it now! Do it slow!
- Hands in the air.

634
00:33:47,266 --> 00:33:49,175
Wanna interlace those
fingers behind your head, sir?

635
00:33:49,199 --> 00:33:50,683
Thank you very much.

636
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:54,653
What do we got?

637
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,150
Hey, man. I"ve never seen
this before. This ain"t mine.

638
00:33:58,174 --> 00:34:00,038
I "m sure it" s not yours.

639
00:34:00,866 --> 00:34:01,867
What"s that?

640
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,181
This? This means you"re under
arrest for the murder of frank Webber.

641
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:08,115
Get him out of here.

642
00:34:20,403 --> 00:34:21,542
<i>We got him.</i>

643
00:34:26,685 --> 00:34:28,135
So, they"ll let him go?

644
00:34:28,963 --> 00:34:31,724
Yeah. He didn"t do it. So, yeah.

645
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,763
Jeremy, did you hear that?
We did it. We saved him.

646
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,837
Thank you. Thank you for believing us.

647
00:34:40,975 --> 00:34:42,977
Yeah. Of course.

648
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:46,195
Why Don"t you put those down, and
we"ll figure out the rest together, okay?

649
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:51,123
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

650
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:52,607
I got it, okay? Okay?

651
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:54,126
You.

652
00:34:55,645 --> 00:34:57,933
Are you gonna say nice things
about me too? I Don"t think so.

653
00:34:57,957 --> 00:35:01,237
And you. You said I"m going
away for first-degree homicide, right?

654
00:35:01,823 --> 00:35:03,101
Wrong. Wrong!

655
00:35:04,378 --> 00:35:08,589
This isn"t over until I
get what I want, okay?

656
00:35:09,176 --> 00:35:10,176
Okay.

657
00:35:14,319 --> 00:35:15,319
She"s breathing.

658
00:35:16,355 --> 00:35:18,426
You, come here. Call your lieutenant.

659
00:35:18,564 --> 00:35:21,291
You tell her I want a deal
now, or I press this button.

660
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:27,642
No, he won"t.

661
00:35:29,092 --> 00:35:30,162
The hell I won"t.

662
00:35:30,852 --> 00:35:31,957
Morgan, what are you doing?

663
00:35:33,372 --> 00:35:35,592
He presses that button, the
only thing that could happen is

664
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:37,136
maybe a garage door
goes up somewhere.

665
00:35:37,238 --> 00:35:39,861
Although, I doubt he"s in range.

666
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:44,176
This bomb will level this place.
They"ll find you all in pieces.

667
00:35:44,314 --> 00:35:46,351
It might. If it was real.

668
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:49,802
You"re bluffing.

669
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,356
I "m not. I" m just remembering.

670
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:53,496
Remembering what?

671
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:56,706
Mainly how ever since the
1991 Montreal convention,

672
00:35:56,844 --> 00:36:00,123
all manufacturers of
plastic explosives in the us

673
00:36:00,261 --> 00:36:02,919
are required to include
a detection taggant.

674
00:36:03,057 --> 00:36:04,817
It "s a substance that
humans can" t smell,

675
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,657
but it acts as an irritant
to the noses of dogs,

676
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:08,890
both trained and untrained.

677
00:36:09,028 --> 00:36:12,348
Whatever is in that box, it sure didn"t
seem to bother the dog I saw this morning.

678
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:15,483
It"s homemade. Brooke built it.

679
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:19,280
Yeah? Did you see her build it,
or did she just tell you she did?

680
00:36:24,665 --> 00:36:25,665
That"s what I thought.

681
00:36:26,943 --> 00:36:29,383
Because there"s no way a
woman who"s trying to get pregnant

682
00:36:29,566 --> 00:36:32,566
is gonna risk handling the toxic
chemicals that it requires to make a bomb.

683
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:37,471
You guys didn"t show
up here together, did you?

684
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:39,576
I remember seeing
you here when I arrived.

685
00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:41,520
You wanted to get here a little
early "cause you didn" t want people

686
00:36:41,544 --> 00:36:43,753
to know that you knew each other, right?

687
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:48,240
Hey, has anybody seen a
person just waltz into the precinct

688
00:36:48,378 --> 00:36:51,347
and make it all the way up to the
fourth floor to deliver a package?

689
00:36:51,485 --> 00:36:54,626
No? Nobody? Yeah, me neither.
Here"s what I think happened.

690
00:36:54,764 --> 00:36:57,905
I think she arrived here
with a bag or a backpack.

691
00:36:58,043 --> 00:37:00,804
"Skipped right up to this floor,
went straight into the ladies" room.

692
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:05,568
Whatever she had in that bag,
she put all together in this box.

693
00:37:06,085 --> 00:37:09,088
Must"ve been heavy. It
does have some heft to it.

694
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,947
It does kinda feel like it could be a bomb.

695
00:37:18,063 --> 00:37:19,063
She"s right.

696
00:37:22,205 --> 00:37:23,241
There"s no bomb.

697
00:37:26,174 --> 00:37:27,797
I lied to you. I"m sorry.

698
00:37:40,948 --> 00:37:43,088
No, no! No!

699
00:37:44,538 --> 00:37:46,298
He"s got a weapon on his back.

700
00:37:48,576 --> 00:37:50,026
Got him.

701
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,873
Yes, and because we"re
still gathering details,

702
00:37:58,897 --> 00:38:00,795
I"ll make an official statement later today.

703
00:38:03,177 --> 00:38:04,177
Mom!

704
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:07,630
My god. My god. Are you hurt?

705
00:38:07,768 --> 00:38:09,666
- Are you hurt? Are you...
- No. No. I"m okay.

706
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:11,955
Ava texted me from inside,
but then I didn"t hear back, so I...

707
00:38:11,979 --> 00:38:12,979
Where are the kids?

708
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:15,234
- They"re with the neighbor.
- I"m okay.

709
00:38:15,258 --> 00:38:16,097
- Are you sure you"re all right?
- Yes.

710
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:17,121
Are you okay?

711
00:38:18,606 --> 00:38:21,246
I"m just glad you"re okay. Got
everyone out safely, didn"t you?

712
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:24,509
Good thing you"re so smart.

713
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,583
Here.

714
00:38:33,172 --> 00:38:34,172
Rain check?

715
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,038
- I"ll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

716
00:38:37,798 --> 00:38:39,144
Thank you. Great. Okay.

717
00:38:39,282 --> 00:38:40,628
- Hey.
- Hey.

718
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:42,975
Thanks for the help.

719
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:44,907
Thank you for the help.

720
00:38:48,705 --> 00:38:51,708
I "m sorry. I really didn" t mean for

721
00:38:51,846 --> 00:38:52,951
I know you didn"t.

722
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:57,127
I"m glad justice was served today
and that an innocent man is free.

723
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,970
But you put my child in danger.

724
00:39:12,108 --> 00:39:14,041
I hope that one day
you"re fortunate enough

725
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:16,319
to experience what
that feels like firsthand.

726
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:20,711
But until then, you just better thank
your lucky stars I"m not on your jury.

727
00:39:33,578 --> 00:39:35,859
Think you can get your hands
on any more of that pudding?

728
00:39:36,546 --> 00:39:39,031
Morgan. Hey.

729
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:41,689
Turns out this hospital
is on my way to work.

730
00:39:41,827 --> 00:39:42,966
Is it?

731
00:39:44,243 --> 00:39:46,004
Just wanted to make sure you"re...

732
00:39:46,142 --> 00:39:48,593
- Alive?
- Yeah. Alive, yeah.

733
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:51,527
Yeah, just a little gunshot wound.

734
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:53,494
It happens.

735
00:39:53,632 --> 00:39:55,116
- Occupational hazard.
- Sure.

736
00:39:56,773 --> 00:39:57,912
How"s your daughter doing?

737
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,294
She"s good. Yeah.

738
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:04,505
It wasn"t exactly the day we had
planned, but Ava"s good. Thank you.

739
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:06,127
We like good.

740
00:40:13,065 --> 00:40:14,964
Good. You"re here. An
arson case just came in.

741
00:40:15,102 --> 00:40:17,702
Multiple coordinate attacks with
some very sophisticated methods.

742
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,451
Soto wants you on it right away.

743
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:21,936
- Just gonna dive right back in?
- Right back in.

744
00:40:22,074 --> 00:40:23,110
Okay.

745
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:28,909
Okay.

746
00:40:30,324 --> 00:40:33,569
- Surprise!
- We wanted to surprise you.

747
00:40:34,673 --> 00:40:36,582
The cop car that followed
me here, that was you guys?

748
00:40:36,606 --> 00:40:38,643
Well, everyone wanted to
be here when you landed

749
00:40:38,781 --> 00:40:41,300
to say thank you, and so did we.

750
00:40:42,716 --> 00:40:44,752
- Come on, Morgan.
- Don "t be shy. Let" s...

751
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,050
- Yes.
- Receive your thanks.

752
00:40:46,098 --> 00:40:47,098
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

753
00:40:47,203 --> 00:40:49,136
- Great work.
- Thank you so much.

754
00:40:49,274 --> 00:40:50,527
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

755
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:51,770
- How"s your head?
- It"s not great.

756
00:40:51,794 --> 00:40:52,954
Yeah, it doesn"t look great.

757
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,843
This is what my daughter should
see. Where was all this yesterday?

758
00:40:55,867 --> 00:40:56,867
Very funny.

759
00:40:58,283 --> 00:41:01,044
I think someone found something
for you down in robbery and homicide.

760
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,472
For me?

761
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:06,671
Yeah. We had an extra one, so...

762
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,604
So.

763
00:41:09,328 --> 00:41:10,606
I Don"t know.

764
00:41:10,744 --> 00:41:11,814
You got a desk.

765
00:41:12,677 --> 00:41:17,336
It wasn"t my idea,
but... Are we good here?

766
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,995
Is this your way of saying "nice job"?

767
00:41:19,097 --> 00:41:21,651
Well, how about if I quit
calling you "the cleaning lady"?

768
00:41:22,307 --> 00:41:24,136
- I think that would be a good idea.
- Yeah.

769
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:27,114
How about I keep calling you all
the stuff I call you behind your back?

770
00:41:28,796 --> 00:41:31,385
All right, all right, everybody.

771
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:32,523
Back to work.

772
00:41:37,909 --> 00:41:40,829
I have a feeling you"re absolutely
never going to sit there, am I right?

773
00:41:40,912 --> 00:41:42,016
I mean, probably not.

774
00:41:43,155 --> 00:41:46,434
What are we working on?

775
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:49,265
Karadec. Yeah. Hold on.
