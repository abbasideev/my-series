1
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,906
How'd you sleep, lieutenant?

2
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,296
- You want me to lie to you?
- Sort of.

3
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,840
Fantastic. Like a baby.

4
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,770
Good morning, detective.

5
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,476
Good morning. Lieutenant slept great.

6
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
I didn't ask. And no, she did not.

7
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,826
Mason puts Anthony acosta's
death between three and five p ...M.

8
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,936
Confirmation of shotgun?

9
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,100
It's the murder weapon.

10
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,976
Next of kin?

11
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,100
Primary suspect, the wife,
Lynette a cost a, vanished.

12
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,666
They have one daughter,
letty, studying up in Santa Cruz.

13
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,636
Should be on her way down here now.

14
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,110
You gave her the news?

15
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,220
So, how do we find the wife?

16
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,530
Only other next of kin
is the sister, Sofia bellier.

17
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,160
Who did this?

18
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,750
Hey! Who did this?

19
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,766
Who changed our board?

20
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,426
A man is dead. Our
primary suspect is missing.

21
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,590
This is not a joke.

22
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,450
Daphne, I wanna know who did this.

23
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,816
Mom!

24
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,560
No, we don't need a
magazine about castles.

25
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,290
Put it back.

26
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,956
It's just lip gloss.

27
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,886
You know, I watched a
documentary the other night,

28
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,236
we can make our own
lip gloss out of beeswax.

29
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,306
Like when we made our own
detergent and all got rashes?

30
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,486
- That could have been foot.
- And-mouth, we don't know.

31
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,176
Why can't you be more like your sister?

32
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,486
She just tried to eat deodorant.

33
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,100
And look how happy she is.

34
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,496
All right. Your grand
total is one... 168.47.

35
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,056
$173.81. Good guess though.

36
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,746
Yeah, it's-it's 168.47.

37
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,290
- Sorry, it's one hundred...
- maybe you missed a coupon.

38
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:27,300
30% off detergent at 7.87,
that's 2.36 for a total of 5.51.

39
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,066
15% off strawberries, that's 84 cents.

40
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,270
And up to two, so you
can scan this one twice.

41
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,666
Okay. 35% off canola
oil at 7.88, 5.13 total.

42
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,016
Okay, I was worried about this
one 'cause I had a little falling-out

43
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,876
with the group on
people, but I apologized.

44
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,916
- We were supposed to be good.
- That one scanned.

45
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,630
3.12 more then.

46
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,886
The ham expires
tomorrow, so we get 40% off.

47
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,126
That is $6.15.

48
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,020
Yeah, the total is 168.47.

49
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,696
4.99 plus tax is 5.34.

50
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,170
173.81 minus 5.34 is 168.47.

51
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,180
Thank you.

52
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,810
Who the hell is this?

53
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,626
When are we getting the car back?

54
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,550
Do you have any idea
how much carburetors cost?

55
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,426
$395.95.

56
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,626
Now, plus tax.

57
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,636
- 420.89.
- Plus labor.

58
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,776
- I don't know how much labor costs.
- Nobody does.

59
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,660
Stop showing off, both of you.

60
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,946
You can pay for groceries
like a normal person.

61
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,816
- You don't have to perform.
- It's not on purpose.

62
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,460
I just see the numbers. I can't help it.

63
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
This is our stop.

64
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,616
Driver, can you put
out the disabled ramp?

65
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,336
Ask him to put out the disabled ramp.

66
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
- No. Mom!
- Driver!

67
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,276
Whoopsie. Whoops!

68
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,300
Could you grab 'em?

69
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,766
We got a lot of options. I know, buddy.

70
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,960
You hungry? Let's go!

71
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,480
- Ooh. Oops.
- I'll see you inside, Chloe.

72
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,456
Don't even offer to help.

73
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,116
I got it. I got it.

74
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,326
It's okay, Henry. I can manage.

75
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,350
Thank you.

76
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,466
Come on.

77
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,296
Don't break your old body.

78
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,156
I can't afford to lose
a babysitter right now.

79
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,430
Your concern is truly touching.

80
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,150
Have you heard from ludo?

81
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,406
We talk every day, Henry. We co-parent.

82
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,306
We're not enemies, we're
just not together anymore.

83
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,820
Does he ever ask about me?

84
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,106
All the time.

85
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,730
He says losing you was the hardest part.

86
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,216
It's for the best and you know it.

87
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,350
- Ludo can't handle me.
- Few can.

88
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,226
Morgan gillory, I'm detective karadec.

89
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,980
This is detective ozdil. We need
you to come down to the station.

90
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,400
Sometimes the music takes control.

91
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,240
Tampering with a criminal
case is a serious crime.

92
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,456
So is obstruction of justice.

93
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,256
It wasn't tampering. I saw
a problem and I tried to fix it.

94
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,076
- You were trying to help us?
- No.

95
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,380
I don't care about you. I
wanted to be able to sleep.

96
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,256
I have a compulsion to put things right.

97
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,396
If I see a mistake, I need to correct it.

98
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,150
Otherwise, I'm up all night obsessing.

99
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,506
That's all I was doing,
cleaning up your mess.

100
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,026
Wanna arrest me for
that? Fine. Go ahead.

101
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,190
You got it.

102
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,330
What mistakes did you see?

103
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:06,410
Okay. So you got a dead body.

104
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,396
I'm assuming you think this lady offed
her husband, but that's not possible.

105
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,536
Look at this room.

106
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,226
Look at this couch.

107
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,536
All of these pillows are evenly
spaced with alternating colors.

108
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,916
Check out these shelves.

109
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,506
<i>Those objects are perfectly sized.</i>

110
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,436
Even the choice of metals is consistent.

111
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,446
This house is immaculate.
The owner is a tidiness freak.

112
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,540
Except...

113
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,276
All of these curtains are
fastened with a tieback

114
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,090
except for one for some reason.

115
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,176
That's odd, isn't it?

116
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,006
<i>You're telling me this woman,</i>

117
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,836
<i>who meticulously
arranges her couch pillows,</i>

118
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,790
<i>doesn't care about her curtains?</i>

119
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,240
So the tieback must have
been used for something else.

120
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,186
See, look. You've got
hair stuck to the chair leg.

121
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,816
<i>Somebody put tape
around it, ripped it off,</i>

122
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,290
the glue stayed and trapped the little bits.

123
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,336
The samples are at the lab.
We found no tape at the scene.

124
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,516
That means someone was
tied up with the curtain cord

125
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,446
<i>and taped to the chair
around their ankles.</i>

126
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,546
And since there are no
marks on the victim's wrist,

127
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,230
it wasn't him who was tied up,

128
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,230
which means there was a third person.

129
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,006
<i>We have Lynette tied to the
chair, victim on the ground</i>

130
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,116
<i>and our unknown bondage freak,</i>

131
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,186
<i>who has either kidnapped
or bumped off Lynette.</i>

132
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,240
That's the person you need to find.

133
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,900
So, you guys made
mistakes, I've fixed them.

134
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,886
Let's not make a big deal out of this.

135
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,676
You got a suspect to find.

136
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,026
I have some expired ham
to fry up before tomorrow.

137
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,190
- So, if you will excuse me.
- Sit down.

138
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,476
Let's wait for the lab results.

139
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,950
For now, this is just speculation.

140
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,966
We have the surveillance footage.

141
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,556
A woman was seen entering the
house at the time of the murder.

142
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,610
The third person.

143
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,866
Oz, please escort miss
gillory to the holding cell.

144
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,666
- What?
- We have to check your story out.

145
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,836
If it all checks out, then you
have nothing to worry about.

146
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,040
- Yeah, I know how to stand.
- Ma'am... thanks.

147
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,496
I was just cleaning up your mess.

148
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,086
You're welcome.

149
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,886
Since when do you show
an open case file to a civilian?

150
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,366
A potential suspect?

151
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,390
Can you refute anything she said?

152
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,980
No.

153
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,616
We have to be sure
because if she's right

154
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,656
then we currently have a botched
homicide investigation with no leads.

155
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,540
And even worse...

156
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,620
We have a second victim.

157
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,350
Hello?

158
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,876
Hi.

159
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,746
This is footage from the a cost a house

160
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,466
at the approximate time of the murder.

161
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,576
Who is she?

162
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,266
Lishka zhang.

163
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,476
A few months ago,
she filed a civil lawsuit

164
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,476
against one of Lynette acosta's clients.

165
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,476
Acosta won the case. It
appears zhang didn't take it well.

166
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,020
She started sending
threatening emails to a cost a.

167
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,766
Miss zhang, three months
ago, you sued Brian dimon,

168
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,736
your boss at spatial technologies.

169
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,350
He harassed me for months.

170
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,876
I ran out of ways to tell him no.

171
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,396
So, one night, he locked me
in his office and assaulted me.

172
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,226
I reported it to the police. I'm
sure you have that in your file.

173
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,880
Insufficient evidence.

174
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,236
Couldn't file criminal
charges, so I sued him.

175
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,300
And you lost.

176
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,996
Is that why you've been sending
Lynette a cost a threatening emails?

177
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,176
I was just questioning
why Lynette a cost a

178
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,526
chose to be complicit in the
suffering of women like me.

179
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,976
You were angry at Mrs. Acosta?

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,316
Of course.

181
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,116
Even though dimon was
the one who assaulted you.

182
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,286
I am angry with him too,

183
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,070
but the police failed me on that front.

184
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,746
What were you doing at
acosta's house yesterday?

185
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,026
I wasn't at her house yesterday.

186
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,630
We have you on video.

187
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,610
And 30 minutes after you
arrived, Anthony a cost a was dead.

188
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,966
That's impossible.

189
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,510
No. No, I-I wasn't there yesterday.

190
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,526
I was at home all day working.

191
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,960
Can anyone confirm that?

192
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,520
No.

193
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,180
You're cleared. Just need you to sign
your paperwork and you're good to go.

194
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,576
She claims to know nothing
about Lynette's whereabouts,

195
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,716
but zhang has no alibi.

196
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,546
We have her at the
scene, and we have motive.

197
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,206
Once we make the arrest, we'll
lean on her for Lynette's location.

198
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,850
- Start writing it up.
- Yeah.

199
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,136
The video has the wrong
date on the time stamp.

200
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,076
This doesn't concern you anymore.

201
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,100
Great.

202
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,860
Wait, what are you talking about?

203
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,526
That's not from yesterday.

204
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,736
Look at the trees.

205
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,520
The wind is blowing from south to north.

206
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,266
Wind in the la basin blows
from the south in the summer,

207
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,816
<i>specifically mid July to September.</i>

208
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,266
Then in late fall,

209
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,500
<i>winds shift in from the
north, peaking in January.</i>

210
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,716
So that's gotta be from
several months ago.

211
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,756
How do you know which
way the wind is blowing?

212
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,640
Have you even looked at your footage?

213
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,750
You got a church.

214
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,860
Churches face east.

215
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,386
Okay, around the eighth century,

216
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,116
<i>priests started orienting
their churches facing east.</i>

217
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,746
<i>They said it was based off the
designs for the holy temple in Jerusalem.</i>

218
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:30,126
But it's also possible that they
wanted the sunrise behind them

219
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,260
<i>to make themselves appear
more godlike and impressive.</i>

220
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,390
But that's not something
we need to get into right now.

221
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,856
All churches face east?

222
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,206
And can't the wind change direction?

223
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,510
Catholic churches built
here in the 1800s do, so yes.

224
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,370
And the wind was definitely
blowing from the north yesterday.

225
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,040
She's right on both counts.

226
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,560
Someone doctored the video.

227
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,770
See ya.

228
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,396
Good lord.

229
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,530
Wait.

230
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,926
How do you do that?

231
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,826
Like I told you, I don't sleep
much. Watch a lot of documentaries.

232
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,260
That doesn't remotely explain this.

233
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,076
I also have an IQ of 160, so that
might have something to do with it.

234
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,076
But you can learn a lot
from a good documentary.

235
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,440
You'd be surprised.

236
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,116
It's a high IQ, we get it. Can I go now?

237
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,730
I know a lot of really smart
people and they're not you.

238
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,946
The technical term is
high potential intellectual.

239
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,466
Means you have
advanced cognitive abilities.

240
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,266
Intellectual creativity,
photographic memory, stuff like that.

241
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,716
But I don't know, I've
just always been this way.

242
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,616
So, it's some sort of a gift?

243
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,430
No, not a gift.

244
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,306
I obsess over every little problem I see.

245
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,270
My mind is constantly
spinning out of control,

246
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,410
which makes it impossible
to hold a job, relationship.

247
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,410
A conversation.

248
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,180
Not a gift.

249
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,926
Morgan.

250
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,646
Ludo? What are you doing here?

251
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,896
Elliot called me and told
me you were arrested again.

252
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,856
I was not technically arrested this time.

253
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,206
Well, great. That's a relief.

254
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,710
- Who's watching our children?
- Hey.

255
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,710
Take it somewhere else.

256
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,410
I'd love to, but you're
standing right in the way.

257
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,736
- Why are you looking at him?
- Please don't look at me.

258
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,146
- Take her out of here.
- He's not taking me anywhere.

259
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,976
He is a driver's ed instructor.

260
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,526
That's not really relevant right now.

261
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,186
It is if you show up in your rehearsal car,

262
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,706
- which I will not be caught...
- I don't care.

263
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,256
Put a muzzle on her or I will.

264
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,986
That's not what you should say..

265
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,366
- Did you say... don't touch me, okay?
- Okay. Morgan.

266
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,716
- Morgan, let's not...
- okay. That's fine. I'm not gonna

267
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,120
- she's got a...
- Hey!

268
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,500
Get off me!

269
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,990
- Always fun to see you, Morgan.
- Don't start.

270
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,766
Hey, how much longer
is this gonna take?

271
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,356
Do you have any idea how
expensive childcare is these days?

272
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,006
Wait, you're paying Henry now?

273
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,650
No, she doesn't have to know that.

274
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,900
Henry misses you, by the way.

275
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,140
Aw.

276
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,026
Letty a cost a, I'm detective
karadec. We spoke on the phone.

277
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,616
I'm handling the investigation
of your father's death.

278
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,920
I'm very sorry for your loss.

279
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,270
My mom's dead too, isn't she?

280
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,030
I don't know.

281
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,316
But I believe that she's
out there, and she's alive,

282
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,000
and I will not stop looking until I find her.

283
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,496
But I need your help, letty.

284
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,040
The more you can tell
me, the faster we can move.

285
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,746
Mom's been having a hard time.

286
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,916
She had a colleague at work.

287
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,020
She killed herself.

288
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,406
I think mom felt guilty about it.

289
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,476
- Who was this colleague?
- I don't know.

290
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,470
But she wrote mom a letter a
couple weeks back and after that,

291
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,276
mom started to spiral.

292
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,866
What did the letter say?

293
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,966
She wouldn't tell me.

294
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,440
But it shook her up bad.

295
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,830
And that's really when all this started.

296
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,016
Do you know where your mom
might keep a letter like that, letty?

297
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,560
If it's not at the house,
it would be in her office.

298
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,426
And you don't know who sent it?

299
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,390
Only her first name. It was

300
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:29,970
Sarah.

301
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,970
Because it's material evidence
into a homicide investigation.

302
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,956
I understand. I understand.

303
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,330
Yes, sir. Thank you.

304
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,066
It's no use.

305
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,866
Lynette a cost a is a defense attorney.

306
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,106
There's no way we're gonna get
a warrant to search her law offices

307
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,216
based on the vague mention of a
letter from someone named Sarah.

308
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,736
I'm gonna go down to their offices
and appeal to their better nature.

309
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,216
I don't like our odds.

310
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,876
Neither do I, but we have
to try everything, right?

311
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,800
A woman is missing,
and we're desperate here.

312
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,290
Take Morgan gillory with you.

313
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,226
If it wasn't for her, we'd be nowhere.

314
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,360
We'd still be treating Lynette
as the primary suspect.

315
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,240
What is she supposed to do?

316
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,170
Same thing she's been doing,
spot the things my detectives miss.

317
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,650
To be fair, I missed them too.

318
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,270
- Look...
- this isn't a debate, Adam.

319
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,380
Looks like I'm gonna be stuck
here a little bit longer than I thought.

320
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,280
Just tell him I love him, and I'll
be home as soon as I can, okay?

321
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,870
Thank you, Henry. I really owe you.

322
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:53,640
Hey, letty, I'm so sorry about
everything that's happened.

323
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Thanks.

324
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,866
Sorry, who are you?

325
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,510
It's

326
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,720
long story. I saw your file.

327
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,500
- They're gonna find your mom.
- You can't know that.

328
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,350
Sorry, everyone keeps
saying the same thing.

329
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
"Don't give up hope."

330
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,606
My dad's dead and
now my mom is gone.

331
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,600
So, what am I supposed to do?

332
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,740
Yeah.

333
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,650
Do you have any pictures of her?

334
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,270
This one, she just sent me two days ago.

335
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,450
Wow. She's beautiful.

336
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,180
It's the last photo I have of her.

337
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,776
You know, what was really helpful for
me was to think of the little moments.

338
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,746
Think of your mom's laugh.

339
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,430
Think about her favorite foods.

340
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,600
You're gonna have to redirect
your brain when you think about her.

341
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,760
Otherwise, you're just gonna
drive yourself crazy while you wait.

342
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,890
You lost someone?

343
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,300
I did, yeah. Long time ago.

344
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,650
Miss a cost a, they're ready for you.

345
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,390
Hey, did you ever find them?

346
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,600
No.

347
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,740
Well, I'm sorry.

348
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,300
Thank you.

349
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,346
So, the way I see it, we're
looking at evidence tampering,

350
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,036
assault on an officer, battery.

351
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,666
Even if we knock it
down to misdemeanors,

352
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,590
you're still looking at six months
minimum and thousands in fines.

353
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,760
Did you really think
this was gonna work?

354
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,900
You're gonna what,
intimidate me into helping you?

355
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,010
If you'd like my help, you
should just ask me nicely.

356
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,220
A woman is missing.

357
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,120
Please, help us find her.

358
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,680
You got it.

359
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,696
Here's what we know. Anthony
a cost a died yesterday afternoon.

360
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,016
Last time anyone saw Lynette, however,
was two days ago at her law office.

361
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,256
Okay. But I'm wondering
who made this case board.

362
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,840
'Cause this is a lot of work.

363
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,700
Also I'm banned from hobby lobby.

364
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,376
Their daughter, letty, believes
that one of Lynette's clients,

365
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,570
identified only as Sarah,

366
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,440
wrote a letter causing significant
tension between her parents.

367
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,926
We're gonna talk to the firm but
only after we interview Lynette's sister

368
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,556
sister. Because she's the last
person who spoke to Lynette,

369
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,726
which I learned from
looking at this case board.

370
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,596
Also, guys, I just figured out this
gentleman in the corner, he's the one.

371
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,030
He makes the case boards.

372
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,860
Why aren't we moving?

373
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,436
Okay, let's be very clear.

374
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,056
You are not gonna say anything,
you are not gonna touch anything,

375
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,436
and you are not going to do anything.

376
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,066
Right, right. I should probably
be strapped in case things pop off.

377
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,610
I'm serious. Do nothing.

378
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,620
You can take my bedroom,
and I'll sleep on the couch.

379
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,946
Sophia, did your sister mention
anyone from her professional circle

380
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,026
who may have died of suicide
recently? Someone named Sarah?

381
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,460
Doesn't sound familiar.

382
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,980
She wrote Lynette a letter. We believe
something in it caused her distress.

383
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:53,166
Sorry. Could you put
that down? It's breakable.

384
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,440
She said nothing?

385
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,270
May get the Sarah part.

386
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,330
Every third woman's name
is Sarah these days, but

387
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,696
somebody writes my sister a
letter, and then she offs herself.

388
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,790
Like, she's probably
gonna say something.

389
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,380
I don't have a sister, but you get it.

390
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,296
Sorry. Who is she?

391
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,226
She is consulting for us.

392
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,126
When was the last time
you spoke to your sister?

393
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,816
Two days ago, she called to
wish me luck with my presentation.

394
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,910
You're a biologist?

395
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,740
Yeah, I had a phd defense.

396
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,330
In front of my peers. I was
nervous, and she calmed me down.

397
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,416
You can read that from over there?

398
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,036
I only read half of it. Biology is boring.

399
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,626
Is that where you were yesterday,

400
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,976
- at your presentation...
- Morgan.

401
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,386
- From, like, 3:00 to 5:00 P.M.?
- Stop it.

402
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,016
I'm just asking about her alibi.

403
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,630
My goodness. You'd think
he's never done this before.

404
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,576
If you can't keep your mouth shut, please
treat our witnesses with some compassion,

405
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,746
particularly grieving
members of the victim's family.

406
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,716
You don't think the Sarah
thing was a little weird?

407
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,886
You died today, I'm telling people about it,

408
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,576
and I've only known
you for, like, four hours.

409
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,376
We have to get our hands on that letter.

410
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,810
Yes, exactly. Let's do it.

411
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,656
We will ask Emery Walker
to search acosta's office.

412
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,060
You will wait in the car.

413
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,060
If I get in that back seat, he's
gonna lock me in the car, isn't he?

414
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,186
Probably.

415
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,776
What am I even doing here?
Do you want my help or not?

416
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,240
No, I do not.

417
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,566
I thought I made that absolutely
clear. I think this whole idea is moronic,

418
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,910
and I am praying that
you will just quit and...

419
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,980
And walk away.

420
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,446
Okay. Let's confirm the sister's alibi.

421
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,066
You go to the university,
talk to her colleagues,

422
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,570
and I'll deal with Emery Walker.

423
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,540
What about her?

424
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,890
Not our problem anymore.

425
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,936
<i>Detective karadec,</i>

426
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,486
it is my personal desire to assist
your investigation in any way possible,

427
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:50,386
but as you can understand, I must also
represent the interests of my law firm.

428
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,536
But your partner's life might be in danger.

429
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,210
And if you return with a
warrant, I'll be happy to comply.

430
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,440
- Hello, bathroom friend.
- Jesus.

431
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,006
What are you doing in here?

432
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,796
I figured I'd find you in
here after the meeting.

433
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,006
Did you think that I wouldn't notice
you compulsively washing your hands

434
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,410
like some sort of clean freak?

435
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,286
- You do know that's a cry for help, right?
- You can't be here.

436
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,620
I know.

437
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,706
Imagine what a men's room is like for
somebody who notices every little detail.

438
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,700
Calm down. Found the Sarah letter.

439
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,476
What? How?

440
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,640
I broke into her office and took it.

441
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,876
Read the letter. Sarah Atkinson was
a paralegal on the Brian dimon case.

442
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,126
And guess what? Brian
dimon assaulted her also.

443
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,196
It's all in there. Same pattern as before.

444
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,576
She begs a cost a to take
action against her client.

445
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,306
I figure, Lynette a cost a
had a crisis of conscience,

446
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,430
was going to turn on dimon,
so he did something about it.

447
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,826
We have motive. We
have a serial criminal.

448
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,896
Let's go arrest him.

449
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
Stop.

450
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,650
You have no idea what you have done.

451
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,300
We have nothing here.

452
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,936
This letter is inadmissible. I
can't have this in my possession.

453
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,836
What? You're gonna let
him go on a technicality?

454
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,566
No, these are not
technicalities. These are laws.

455
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,636
Principles that I have
devoted my entire life to protect.

456
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,606
Jesus. I thought my life was sad.

457
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,770
Your life is sad.

458
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,536
You've got shopping carts from three
different grocery stores in your yard.

459
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,026
I wouldn't have to go to different stores,

460
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,646
but safe way has
those weird wheel locks.

461
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,406
This is the law. There is
absolutely nothing here

462
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,066
that proves that Brian
dimon murdered anyone.

463
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,406
And even if there was, guess
what, we can't use it in court.

464
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,166
Because despite what you may think,

465
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,586
we can't run around breaking into
offices and arresting people at whim.

466
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,370
That's not how the law works.

467
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,960
Right now, the only clear crime
here has been committed by you.

468
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,046
And by me if I let you get away with it.

469
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,240
- But if...
- stop talking.

470
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,566
Okay. This didn't happen.

471
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,790
You're gonna take this letter,

472
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,986
and you're gonna put it back
exactly where you found it.

473
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,220
And if you get caught, I am
going to arrest you myself.

474
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,260
And then what?

475
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,090
And then we're gonna
go talk to Brian dimon.

476
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:38,796
Mr. Dimon. A few months ago,
you were sued by lishka zhang.

477
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,550
- And I won.
- Yes.

478
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:46,396
She wrote to your lawyer in fact, "he
harassed me over the course of six"...

479
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,916
This is my first
interrogation. What do we do?

480
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,126
You don't do anything.

481
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,986
Is it like a good cop, bad cop situation?

482
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,606
You want me to go in
and flip the table over?

483
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,986
No.

484
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,570
She lost her case.

485
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,090
The jury saw the truth. Lishka zhang
is simply an employee with a grudge.

486
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,516
Those seem to follow you around.

487
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,620
Tell me about your
relationship with Sarah Atkinson.

488
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,076
When do we get to hit
him with a phone book?

489
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,410
Never.

490
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,270
Hey, how's it coming?

491
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,596
Let's get ready for his alibi. Give me
a data print on the day of the murder.

492
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,620
I'm on it. Yeah.

493
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,977
Also tell Daphne I took one of
her lollipops, and I feel bad about it.

494
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:21,016
I'm not telling her that.

495
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,946
I heard her. And thank you.

496
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,676
I thought I was here to help
with my lawyer's disappearance,

497
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,250
not relitigate old claims.

498
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,290
The Atkinson claims are not old.

499
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,020
Well, if there have been new claims
against me, I'm not aware of them.

500
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,996
Yeah? I got bad news.

501
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,106
Dimon wasn't in town the day of
the murder. Wasn't anywhere close.

502
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,386
He was in Fontana.

503
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,796
You certain?

504
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,130
Positive.

505
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:51,006
Fontana? The Kentucky
of California? "Fontucky"?

506
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,666
What the hell was he doing in Fontana?

507
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,930
Doesn't matter. He wasn't here.

508
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:03,196
Look at his shoes. Those
are Italian seams handcrafted.

509
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,740
Look at his watch.

510
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,090
That guy is not gonna be
caught dead in Fontana.

511
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,656
There are only two
reasons you go to Fontana.

512
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,440
Number one, you wanna
catch hepatitis at the water park.

513
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,836
Number two, you have to go to
your cousin's bachelorette party,

514
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,270
<i>and she is on a budget.</i>

515
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:27,256
I can literally think of a hundred
other reasons to go to Fontana.

516
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,310
Okay, ask him.

517
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,226
Tell karadec to ask dimon
what he was doing in Fontana.

518
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,886
My lawyer, my friend, is missing.

519
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:38,196
Please tell me you didn't bring me
in here to rehash vague grievances

520
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,506
<i>by hysterical employees.</i>

521
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,266
What is happening? I
gotta see him right now.

522
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,856
I understand. I understand.

523
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,376
Let's take care of this right now.

524
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,926
The incompetence!

525
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:47,897
Tell karadec.

526
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,200
It's not how this works.

527
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,480
Hey!

528
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,726
Ask him about Fontana.

529
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,550
- Hey!
- The hell is this?

530
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,566
Don't say another word.

531
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,870
Mr. Dimon, thank you for your time.

532
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,180
What?

533
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,040
No!

534
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,916
Chester Emery's secretary
noted a woman dressed, quote,

535
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,406
"quite provocatively for the cleaning staff"

536
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,980
entered acosta's office
twice this afternoon.

537
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,020
What happened?

538
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,790
Karadec.

539
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,386
Karadec. Dimon was in Fontana on the
day of the murder. You gotta ask him why.

540
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:37,286
Stop. We're done. This entire
idiotic experiment is finished.

541
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,466
It doesn't make any sense.

542
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,830
Stop pretending you can do this. It's over.

543
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,296
Be grateful you're not in jail.

544
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,560
Go back to your real life, Morgan.
Leave this to the professionals.

545
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,356
Do you know what direction all
stairs went in medieval castles?

546
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,590
Clockwise. You know why?

547
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,536
To make it easier to chop
people coming up the stairs?

548
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,706
Exactly.

549
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,436
But what if you're left-handed?

550
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:23,740
Well, the world wasn't exactly
built for people who are different.

551
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,050
Phone away at the table, please.

552
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,950
Eat dinner with your
family like a normal person.

553
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,170
Hey.

554
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:50,016
You know, Chloe and Elliot are
gonna be with ludo this weekend.

555
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,576
So I was thinking we could go to the
park like we used to. Get some ice cream.

556
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,010
I'm not six.

557
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,430
What's going on?

558
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,656
I'm-I'm not like you and Elliot.

559
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:13,720
He's got your memory, your... your
brain, your way of noticing everything.

560
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,690
Well, you got some of my qualities too.

561
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,226
You know, you got my
rebelliousness, my distrust of authority,

562
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,940
- my sweet fashion sense.
- I have your worst qualities.

563
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,700
Elliot and Chloe have everything.

564
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,981
To be fair, Chloe is still a baby.
We don't really know her deal yet.

565
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,950
It's not what I'm talking about.

566
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,880
Ludo thinks of you as his daughter.

567
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,200
It's not the same.

568
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,540
No. No, you're right. It's not.

569
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,890
Honey, your father loved you so much.

570
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,410
Sure. That's why he left.

571
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,596
No, it's more complicated than that.

572
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,086
It's fine. Whatever. I don't
even remember him. Who cares?

573
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,940
- If he could be here...
- I'm glad he's not.

574
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,180
I wanna be alone.

575
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
Okay.

576
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,056
Wait, Elliot, don't forget
your science project.

577
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,306
Ava, you can't have
doughnuts for breakfast.

578
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:46,026
Shall we eat? Why are you
being a jerky today? Here you go.

579
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,050
Elliot.

580
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,470
There's a man standing in our yard.

581
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,480
Why did you want me to
ask dimon about Fontana?

582
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,496
Come inside.

583
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,970
This mush needs to go into this kid.

584
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,016
Dimon is not a Fontana guy.

585
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,336
More importantly, I noticed something
in Sofia's apartment yesterday.

586
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,640
<i>All of the little tchotchkes on her
shelves were dusty except for one.</i>

587
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:23,896
Sofia was in Fontana
recently. So was dimon.

588
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,826
So what? People go to Fontana.

589
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,030
Both of them?

590
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,481
Why does it matter? They both
have alibis for the time of the murder.

591
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,420
Come on.

592
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,746
Pick up the phone, Henry!

593
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:50,716
You can't borrow my car today.

594
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,646
I don't need to borrow your car today.

595
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,206
I did need to borrow his car
today. But that's beside the point.

596
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,370
Just come over here!

597
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,686
How long does it take for flowers
to die after you deliver them?

598
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,136
Like, wilted and brown die?

599
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,100
It depends on a few factors.
Mainly, the type of flower.

600
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,790
- Ranunculus?
- Four days, at least.

601
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,380
Henry.

602
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,706
You are a good man.
And an even better florist.

603
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,846
Let's go!

604
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,156
What?

605
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,870
I'll explain on the way.

606
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,180
Go, go, go. Grab the car seat.

607
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,390
Grab the car seat.

608
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,786
Dimon and Sofia are having an affair.

609
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,330
He was trying to groom her like
the others, but she was on board.

610
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,936
He's doing it to stay close to Lynette

611
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,696
because he knows he's
guilty and he needs leverage.

612
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,966
Can we run the siren?

613
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,556
- Absolutely not.
- Sure.

614
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,000
No, no. Mom, no, stop.
Not in the drop-off line.

615
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:59,120
This is the LAPD. We have an
apb out on two extreme cutie-pies.

616
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,817
All right. Everyone, have
a good day. Go, bulldogs.

617
00:36:01,841 --> 00:36:03,400
Bye. Love you.

618
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,166
So, dimon, he learns of
Lynette's change of heart, right?

619
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,796
He knows this is the end
for him. He's desperate now.

620
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,836
He and Sofia go to Lynette's house
to put pressure on her. But, surprise.

621
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,456
Her husband Anthony is there too.

622
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,070
And that is when things
quickly get out of hand.

623
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,596
I... I'm with a student.

624
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,620
Great. You can teach her how
to install a car seat. Thanks, babe.

625
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,520
- Again, the problem is...
- that they both have alibis.

626
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,050
But what if the murder did not
happen when we think it happened?

627
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,210
Okay.

628
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,840
Dimon and Sofia are
trying to threaten Lynette.

629
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,150
Noted second amendment enthusiast
Anthony a cost a gets involved.

630
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,276
Turns out to be not the
best decision for him.

631
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,650
And now we've got a dead body.

632
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,510
Which is a real kick in the nards 'cause
what are we gonna do with Lynette?

633
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,076
<i>But how did they cover it up?</i>

634
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,046
<i>Time of death was
during Sofia's presentation.</i>

635
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,350
<i>All of her colleagues are there.</i>

636
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,950
Letty's last picture of her
mom was taken three days ago.

637
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,026
These flowers were fresh and
new. They should still be pink.

638
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,960
But they were already dead
in the crime scene photos.

639
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,696
What does dimon do for a living?

640
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,246
Security technology.

641
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,046
And what does Sofia do for a living?

642
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,340
She's a botanist.

643
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,970
Do you know what this room is?

644
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,350
A greenhouse.

645
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,296
- Yes. Yes. These are state.
- Of-the-art climate control.

646
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,190
So dimon turns the entire
place into one giant refrigerator.

647
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,066
<i>He freezes acosta's body and leaves.</i>

648
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,716
<i>That night, he doctors the
video, framing lishka zhang.</i>

649
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,066
<i>The next day, he raises
the temperature remotely,</i>

650
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,136
<i>cooking the house and
completely messing up</i>

651
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,720
the coroner's time of death estimate.

652
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,316
<i>And what did they do with Lynette?</i>

653
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,556
If they were gonna kill her,
they would've done that here.

654
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,426
That's the smart move.

655
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,046
Well, maybe Sofia has
a hard time with that.

656
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:44,366
I mean, it is her sister,
so they kidnap her, right?

657
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,590
To buy themselves some time.

658
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,840
And where did they take her?

659
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,436
Ask dimon what he
was doing in Fontana.

660
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,236
You see, Fontana's not that far
away. It has to be relatively close.

661
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,066
They gotta get there and
back in the same night.

662
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,926
And there's no paper trail, no
charges for either of them in that area.

663
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:03,890
So they're taking her someplace
secure. Someplace one of them owns.

664
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,440
Someplace they've been
meeting up to have their affair.

665
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,520
Someplace remote...

666
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,070
But familiar.

667
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,600
It's okay.

668
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,610
Lynette a cost a is gonna
be okay thanks to you.

669
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,960
It's a job offer.

670
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:19,930
Come be a consultant. Do
this full time. We need you.

671
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,360
I'm not cut out for this.

672
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,640
But thank you.

673
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:48,030
If you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

674
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,980
Mom.

675
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,516
Mom. Mom! Mom!

676
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,400
- Letty!
- Mom! Mom!

677
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,786
Ava, I need to talk to you about your dad.

678
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:43,840
Mom, no.

679
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,126
You should have seen the look on
his face when I told him I was pregnant.

680
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,306
- Stop it.
- He was so happy.

681
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,470
Then why did he leave?

682
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:56,416
He didn't leave. He... he vanished.

683
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,896
Something happened to him.

684
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,526
And the police, they never believed me.

685
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,936
But I know that he
would not have left you.

686
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,906
Hey, but he did. He's gone.

687
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,496
He's been gone for 15 years, mom,
and lying to me about it isn't gonna help.

688
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,630
Honey, I'm not lying to you.

689
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,016
I'm telling you that he would
not have done that to us.

690
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,700
Then stop lying to yourself.

691
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,186
I want a raise. Add 30% to your offer.

692
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:47,016
No, add 20% and childcare.
You figure that part out.

693
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,250
Is that it?

694
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,530
If I work for you, you work for me too.

695
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,010
I need you to find someone.

696
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,950
His name is Roman sinquerra.

697
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,996
And he vanished 15 years ago.

698
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,990
The police say that he just skipped
town, but I know that he didn't.

699
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:04,610
So, I need help.

700
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,860
Please help me find him.

701
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,110
You got a deal.
