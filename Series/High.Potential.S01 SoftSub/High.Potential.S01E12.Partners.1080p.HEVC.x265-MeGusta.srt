1
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,676
Hey. Aw. It's okay, boy.

2
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,910
It's okay, boy. I got
you. I got you. I got you.

3
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,540
Everything all right?

4
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,370
See, bud? Nothing to worry about. Yeah.

5
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,436
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

6
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,616
Anson! Come here. Help him.

7
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,880
- My god.
- What happened? Is he breathing?

8
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,586
Anson. Get a medic.
Somebody get a medic.

9
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,996
Anson, wake up.

10
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,020
Somebody call for help!

11
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,116
Hey, where are you?

12
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,806
<i>Sorry. Sorry. I'm pulling up right now.</i>

13
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,876
All right. Book in bag. Let's go.

14
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,466
But Anna and count vronsky are

15
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,816
will be waiting for you. Come on, guys.

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,016
- Let's see some hustle.
- Yeah. Thanks, coach.

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,250
<i>There was only one checkout
Lane open in the store,</i>

18
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,360
<i>so the place was a zoo,</i>

19
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,430
but I got everything on the list.

20
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,810
- Elliot, I got your junk cereal.
- Cool.

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,066
Don't tell your mom.

22
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,400
Ava, I got spearmint gum

23
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,350
that's at the bottom of
one of these two bags.

24
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,440
Happy fishing.

25
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,866
And most importantly, fresh
diapers for my baby Chloe.

26
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,386
Whoa. Fragrance and dye
free? What is it, her birthday?

27
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,720
Well, you make it easy for me

28
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,186
to do my job by paying for everything.

29
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,330
Speaking of which, can you
do pickups this afternoon?

30
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,140
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

31
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,156
Yeah, I have to move a couple
of things arou... but yes. Yep.

32
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,846
Good? Great. I love you.
Have a great day. Bye.

33
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,510
- Yeah, love you.
- Bye. Have a good one.

34
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,506
Shut the backdoor when you leave.

35
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,460
Yes, I'm on it. Have a good one.

36
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,470
You thinking poison?

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,516
There's no way to know for sure

38
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,640
until I do an autopsy.

39
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,586
But seems the most likely
based on what I'm seeing.

40
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,730
Good thing is I don't
believe it's an airborne toxin.

41
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,346
I'll call off Hazmat.

42
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,176
- Any scene restrictions?
- Don't touch anything.

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,666
Eyes only until I get a full
toxicology done at the lab,

44
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,806
find out exactly what we're
really dealing with here.

45
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,736
Gillory, with two I's.

46
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,326
I-I'm sorry. I don't see...
come on. Hey! Hi! Hi!

47
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,730
She's clear. Let her through.

48
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,670
Thank you. Thank you so
much. Have a beautiful day.

49
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,266
Seriously? Airport police?

50
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,436
Morgan.

51
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,546
Yeah, I see him. Who is he?

52
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,570
Anson Pierce.

53
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,760
Founder of a company
called Virgo core beta systems.

54
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,376
Just landed from a short
flight out of orange county.

55
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,300
He's a big player in the tech world.

56
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,990
Developed a popular and controversial

57
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,866
social media platform called enigmafied.

58
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,246
It can turn any video you have
into a deep fake within minutes.

59
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,426
A few simple words of
direction in an son's app

60
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,860
can transform images of you

61
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,426
playing with your kids in the park

62
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,256
to you spanking one
of your kids in the park.

63
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,870
Wow. Awesome.
That's not terrifying at all.

64
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,390
Please tell me an son
wasn't traveling with a pet.

65
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,436
He was. His dog, Edison.

66
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,460
The animal's fine.

67
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,266
It's being evaluated now along with
an son's security team and the pilots.

68
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,276
Go ahead and start processing
the inside of the plane.

69
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,880
Yeah.

70
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,750
Geez. Who's that?

71
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,426
- Adam.
- Ronnie.

72
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,186
This is FBI special agent Oliver.

73
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,636
Respectfully, because
this is an FBI investigation

74
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,776
says who?

75
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,876
Well, I don't wanna step
on anyone's toes here,

76
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,606
but you and I both
know that any homicide

77
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,226
originating in us airspace

78
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,940
falls under the jurisdiction of the FBI.

79
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,056
It's too early to determine
where the homicide originated.

80
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,166
You know what it's not
too soon to determine?

81
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,716
Who our dead guy got in a fight with

82
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,430
back in orange county on the ground.

83
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,020
I don't think those busted blood
vessels are from turbulence.

84
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,516
I'm sorry. Who is she?

85
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,420
I'm standing right here.
You could just ask me.

86
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,300
Who are you?

87
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,556
Morgan.

88
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,580
She's a consultant.

89
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,076
I see.

90
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,386
It's nice to meet you, Morgan.

91
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,530
And you're absolutely right.

92
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,256
The petechiae on the victim's
neck, it's highly unusual.

93
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,806
Our medical examiner's already arranged

94
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,366
to have the body
transported to our morgue.

95
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,040
So if we need any assistance
on this case, I'll reach out.

96
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,986
I'm gonna take a peek
around the plane, do my thing.

97
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,390
Whoa, whoa, not so fast.

98
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,196
By law, that aircraft is our crime scene.

99
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,546
Only my team should be on
the plane for the time being.

100
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,060
Would you kindly ask your
detectives to step off, please?

101
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,090
Oz.

102
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,960
Yeah?

103
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,060
Now, look, my concern is

104
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,146
that your medical examiner
is gonna quickly discover

105
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,216
that they are ill-equipped
to crack the code

106
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,240
on whatever toxin killed our victim,

107
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,140
let alone deduce how
it was administered.

108
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,970
- Here we go.
- Based on intel and my intuition,

109
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,636
this is not a cyanide-in-a-soup situation.

110
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,986
The is far more sophisticated, okay?

111
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,506
The what of this case will be hard,

112
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,400
but I guarantee you
the how will be harder.

113
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,160
Are you finished?

114
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,050
I'm gonna wanna be there
for your me's initial findings.

115
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,780
I'll see you at your precinct.

116
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,850
All right. So...

117
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,246
Not a fan of the feds?

118
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,720
Some guys are better than others.

119
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,310
And what kind of a guy is Ronnie Oliver?

120
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,596
If you like overbearing federal agents

121
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,876
who think they can do no wrong

122
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,256
and wanna call all the shots,
Ronnie would be your guy.

123
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,970
So you guys have butted heads before.

124
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
Yeah, it's been a while.

125
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,366
Well, he called you Adam.

126
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,746
They only people I've
heard call you Adam

127
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,010
are the lieutenant and your mom

128
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,886
- when she called on your birthday.
- That was a private call.

129
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,376
- Then don't take it in the bullpen.
- Morgan,

130
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,200
not everything is a
puzzle you need to solve.

131
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,686
Come on. Clearly, you and
this special agent have history.

132
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,896
I need to know what it
is so I can be prepared.

133
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,610
Or use it to make fun of you.

134
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,510
He used to be my partner.

135
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,146
That's all I get?

136
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,210
That's all you get.

137
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,396
You really don't think
your new partner deserves

138
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,846
to know what happened
with your last partner?

139
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,296
You and I are not officially partners.

140
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,466
Not officially, but you and I are both...

141
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,530
Morgan.

142
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,630
I need a favor. It's kind of a big one.

143
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,026
- What?
- No more questions about Ronnie, okay?

144
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,570
Focus on the case. Can we do that?

145
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,850
- Yes, let's focus on the case.
- Thank you.

146
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,136
Anson Pierce has been
the subject of controversy

147
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,896
over his social media platform.

148
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,796
It lets users create images
and videos that look so real,

149
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,860
it's impossible to tell
what's fake and what's not.

150
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,170
Or it can be used to
create misinformation

151
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,380
that can impact our
politics, destroy reputations

152
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,000
and put people's lives in danger.

153
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,156
Congress has tried to
regulate his company for years,

154
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,776
but he has an army
of lawyers and lobbyist.

155
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,560
No wonder he needed protection.

156
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,916
Where's his security detail now?

157
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,786
Still in the process of
being cleared at the hospital.

158
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,026
We're getting an eta on when
they can come in for questioning.

159
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,740
And if an son was
poisoned on the plane,

160
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,096
that makes them all suspects.

161
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,406
Diana, it's good to see you.

162
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,570
Always a pleasure, Ronnie.

163
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,616
Hold on. They let you in the building?

164
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,966
Lieutenant soto, so good to see you.

165
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,106
Good to see you.

166
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,486
Wow. It's strange to be back here.

167
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,316
Yeah, strange to have you back.

168
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,626
I hear you're helping us
out on one of our cases.

169
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,696
Something like that.

170
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,046
We're waiting on the me to determine

171
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,310
where the murder took place.

172
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,660
That'll determine jurisdiction.

173
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,226
Shouldn't you have a visitor badge
or something if you wanna be up here?

174
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,250
I won't stay long.

175
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,430
I just figured while we
wait on your me's findings,

176
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,406
I'll join you while you question
an son's family and witnesses.

177
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,026
And I'll need the
transcripts before I leave.

178
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,570
If it's not too much trouble.

179
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,360
Detective, you mind some company?

180
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,300
Why not?

181
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,896
Gloria, we're very sorry for your loss.

182
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,246
Right now, we're trying to gather
as much information as we can.

183
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,340
What can you tell us about your son?

184
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,526
When most kids were out
kicking a ball or riding bikes,

185
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,800
an son wanted to change the world.

186
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,660
He was nine when I
realized his brain works

187
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,350
in ways most of ours don't.

188
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,926
- How long ago were they partners?
- - Sorry.

189
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,756
A few years before you got here.

190
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,826
- <i>It's okay.
- Those two set a record</i>

191
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,796
for closing the most
cases in a single year.

192
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,820
<i>Take your time.</i>

193
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,370
They were quite the team.

194
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,510
Until they weren't.

195
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,386
It was a rough year for all of us.

196
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,046
<i>Every parent hopes their
kid will find something</i>

197
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,706
<i>that they're passionate about.</i>

198
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,010
But you never think for a moment...

199
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,460
That it might make your child a target.

200
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,880
Did an son ever mention
anyone he was concerned about?

201
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,910
All the time.

202
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,820
Jealous competitors, stalkers,
every other tech blogger.

203
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,610
<i>I didn't agree with everything an son did.</i>

204
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,896
<i>What parent does?</i>

205
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,440
<i>But his heart was in the right place.</i>

206
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,526
<i>We're gonna check an son's
calendar and see if we can...</i>

207
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,990
Me just called up. Preliminary
autopsy on an son is finished.

208
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,776
His toxicology screen won't
come back for a day or two.

209
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,606
So we can't be totally
sure he was poisoned?

210
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,630
Or how.

211
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,460
It could be inhaled, ingested or injected.

212
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,980
And I did find this.

213
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,446
Injection site? That's possible.

214
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,470
But not likely.

215
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,106
- She always like this?
- Yes.

216
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,370
Based on how he died,

217
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,416
my guess would be a
poison in the Anthrax family,

218
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
but modified.

219
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,946
Okay, we need to know
the makeup of the poison,

220
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,730
so we can determine
who might've created it.

221
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,536
Whoever made the poison may
not be the person who killed an son.

222
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,846
Right, but they'll probably
remember who they sold it to.

223
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,040
All due respect, we gotta
get this body to my people

224
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,150
as soon as possible.

225
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,956
Former Navy seal, coast guard

226
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,716
and we've got Parker.

227
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,090
SWAT team out of ventura.

228
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,656
I see you're still carrying
your handcuff key?

229
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,440
Yeah, for, good luck.

230
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,726
Guess it wasn't good enough today.

231
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,316
So you have no idea how the guy

232
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,890
you were hired to protect was killed?

233
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,650
Believe me, I wish we did.

234
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,326
You don't know or you're not telling us?

235
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,806
You think we had
something to do with it?

236
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,900
Do you know how hard it'll be
for any of us to find a job now?

237
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,496
Mr. Pierce died on our watch.

238
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,490
His life ending or your career?

239
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,576
Hey, I liked Mr. Pierce,
but we weren't with him 24/7.

240
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,150
If we knew anything, we'd tell you.

241
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,910
Your boss was a very busy man.

242
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,236
Looks like almost every
hour of his last week

243
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,376
is accounted for here on his schedule.

244
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,346
The thing that bothers me is that

245
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,131
every meeting here is so detailed
except for this one: Orange county.

246
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,650
Two hours, no location,
no name. What's that about?

247
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,650
We don't know.

248
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,830
He had us drive him to an
office building downtown.

249
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,900
He asked us to wait in the car.

250
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,770
We're gonna need that address.

251
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,150
- Morgan, you got anything?
- Not yet.

252
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,716
What about you? None of
those security guards confessed?

253
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,096
No, but there's a two-hour window

254
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,206
before an son got on his plane

255
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,726
where they claim to have
no idea where he was.

256
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,136
Well, that's not nothing.

257
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,516
I'm heading back to the bureau.

258
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,726
I'll have my team look
into the backgrounds

259
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,136
of an son's security team.

260
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,230
As will we.

261
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,076
Okay. And please
expedite the body transfer.

262
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,626
Ronnie, I think you should reconsider.

263
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,480
Adam, it's not personal, all right?

264
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,396
I think it's best for my team to handle
this investigation without interference.

265
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,310
Things will move a lot faster. Trust me.

266
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,760
Trust you? Really?

267
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,350
Where'd we get this flash drive?

268
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,606
Found it in an son's jacket pocket.

269
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,816
I had it processed this morning.

270
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,770
- It's not his.
- What do you mean?

271
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,150
Anson's first breakthrough
in tech was designing

272
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,530
<i>a higher capacity flash drive</i>

273
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,236
<i>his sophomore year at taft high school.</i>

274
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,616
<i>His company still makes them today.</i>

275
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,236
So, why would he have a flash drive

276
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,966
from one of his competitors
in his coat pocket?

277
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,060
- He wouldn't.
- Let's see what's on that drive.

278
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,946
Wait. What happened? Is
your computer down too?

279
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,026
- I don't know. It just went blank.
- What's happened?

280
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,050
What's going on?

281
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,910
What the hell happened?

282
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,446
The hard drive we found on
an son must've had malware

283
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,516
that breached our fire wall.

284
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,020
I'm running every anti
virus program I can.

285
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,896
Keep trying till something works.

286
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,246
Someone wanted what
this malware's doing to us

287
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,270
to happen to an son.

288
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,866
And if someone was able
to give a hard drive to an son,

289
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,666
then they were close
enough to poison him too.

290
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,696
Oz, pull any and all cctv

291
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,356
on an son's whereabouts
in orange county

292
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,740
before he boarded his plane to la.

293
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,426
Whoever gave that flash drive
to an son is our prime suspect.

294
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,116
- Got it.
- I'll head to the field office

295
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,226
and get a tech team to do
a sweep for satellite video.

296
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,846
Great. We can use
all the help we can get.

297
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,310
Until we're back online, there's
nothing else we can do here.

298
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
You two, go with him.

299
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,060
So, do we need to go over the rules?

300
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,780
- Rules?
- Let's just get in, get out,

301
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,230
mine the FBI for any information

302
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,410
we can use on the
case, then get back home.

303
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,580
- You worried I'm gonna embarrass you?
- Not at all.

304
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,526
I'm just saying let's both be
on our best behavior, okay?

305
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,526
Always.

306
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,490
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to
ask you to empty your bag.

307
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,180
You got it.

308
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,630
Applesauce.

309
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,336
Agent Oliver.

310
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,166
Everyone, this is detective
karadec from the LAPD.

311
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,810
- And his consultant...
- Gillory. Nice to meet you all.

312
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,516
All right. Rina's one of top profilers

313
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,686
and was about to take us through.

314
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,060
Yeah, great.

315
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,610
Okay. Now, based upon what we know

316
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,936
about an son Pierce's murder,

317
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,316
and data from a wide
range of crimes like this,

318
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,356
I believe the killer was
likely a single white male.

319
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,356
Educated but unemployed.
Someone in his orbit.

320
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,946
Likely, a professional contact

321
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,290
who had the ability to get close.

322
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,700
Do you have something you wanna add?

323
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,290
Just... yeah, that's
definitely a possibility.

324
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,160
You got another one?

325
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,686
Well, I don't have any
formal training in profiling

326
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,710
we know.

327
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,300
Yeah, of course you do.

328
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,610
Let's see.

329
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,130
Based on my own
data called "gut instinct,"

330
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,830
given an son's polarizing
views on technology.

331
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,210
I think it is possible
that the killer could

332
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,040
be a shut-in who hated an son.

333
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,870
A luddite who disliked technology.

334
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,580
Somebody who was pissed off at
what the company was doing. Right?

335
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,710
'Cause this just feels
like a personal thing to me.

336
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,670
You think my profile's off?

337
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,540
Didn't... Didn't I just explain that?

338
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,680
Tech team just found this.

339
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,510
Enhance that image.

340
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,726
That must be the flash drive
we found in an son's pocket.

341
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,076
Apply facial recognition
and run it through the system.

342
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,766
- How long is that gonna take?
- Not long.

343
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,830
Already found him.

344
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,946
Simon keating. Looks like
he's unemployed and single.

345
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,560
Nice work, rina. All
right, let's bring this guy in.

346
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,940
When did this happen?

347
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,886
Shortly after you slipped
that flash drive into his pocket.

348
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,430
So, did you kill him?

349
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,686
<i>Are you serious?</i>

350
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,996
Yeah, I am. He's dead.
And you got real close.

351
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,610
I was just trying to get his attention.

352
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,176
Okay? He didn't understand
how much we had in common,

353
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,580
how much I could help him.

354
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,720
I needed an son to realize that
his cybersecurity infrastructure

355
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,760
was being spearheaded
by maladroit morons.

356
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,466
I wanted to protect
him from the white hats.

357
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,876
They're ethical-minded super hackers

358
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,056
that are not to be trifled with.

359
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,536
So you want me to
believe that you're a hacker

360
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,196
who tried to protect an son from
other hackers by hacking him?

361
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,026
<i>Not quite that simple, but close enough.</i>

362
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,490
<i>You know what else is not so simple?</i>

363
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,950
The poison that killed an son.

364
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,686
The good news is his body's landing

365
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,230
at our toxicology lab within the hour.

366
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,300
Which means we'll get to the
bottom of what toxin was used

367
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,370
and who used it real soon.

368
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,270
We'll keep you in holding until then.

369
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,550
<i>Plenty of sunshine and
blue skies on tap for you...</i>

370
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,190
Don't shoot.

371
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,400
Okay, okay. All right.

372
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,090
What's happening?

373
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,186
I don't think rina the profiler
and I are gonna be friends.

374
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,370
Yeah, well, you know, Morgan,

375
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,986
I think the fact that an
son's body just got blown up

376
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,126
might take precedence.

377
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,266
That's fair.

378
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,840
Guys, please, tell me we got a lead

379
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,230
on whoever attacked our coroner.

380
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,600
CSI is processing the
scene. So far, nothing.

381
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,160
Not a single witness? Nothing?

382
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,966
Anson's body should've never
come here in the first place.

383
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,160
No one could've anticipated
this would happen, Ronnie.

384
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,990
It's becoming painfully clear
that some things never change.

385
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,486
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means stop being so stubborn

386
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,906
and admit you made the wrong call.

387
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,970
The wrong call about what?

388
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,216
Staying on this case. My
team doesn't need assistance!

389
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,000
It's causing too many problems!

390
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,070
We don't gotta turn this
into some kinda contest.

391
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,350
Contest? We're doing
our jobs same as you.

392
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,110
- Oz, right?
- Yeah.

393
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,870
Do me a favor. Stay in your Lane.

394
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,320
And you do me a favor.

395
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,956
Show us some respect in our house.

396
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,100
You don't live here anymore.

397
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,096
- Daphne...
- no. That is my partner you're talking to.

398
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,166
Choose your words carefully.

399
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,710
That sounds like a warning, detective.

400
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,276
- How perceptive.
- Lieutenant, you gonna step in here?

401
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,400
No.

402
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,130
Maybe we should all
just get back to work.

403
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,486
Good idea.

404
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,936
Let me hit somebody at the
bureau to see if they can help

405
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,240
put an son's body back
together piece by piece.

406
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,806
I don't know if I ever
mentioned it to you guys,

407
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:25,256
but I was in labor for two hours

408
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,350
with my third baby
before she popped out.

409
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,296
There she was, brand-new
person in the world.

410
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,916
The point is, a lot can
happen in 120 minutes.

411
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,816
So instead of doing whatever
this is that you guys are doing,

412
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,546
maybe we circle back
to that mystery meeting

413
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,130
that an son had the day before he died.

414
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,136
Yeah, because poisoning an son

415
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,726
and orchestrating an
attack to destroy evidence

416
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,276
feels like a lot for
one person to pull off.

417
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,626
And Simon's been in holding
all day and couldn't have done it.

418
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,386
You think our killer was
working with a partner?

419
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,626
I do. So maybe whoever an son
met in that two-hour time window

420
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,696
is the one who poisoned him.

421
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,790
Okay, so are we
compiling a list of experts

422
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,836
who could make a poison
like the one that killed an son?

423
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,240
Do you really think I don't
already have a digital dossier

424
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,156
with multiple suspects waiting
for me back at the field office?

425
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,590
Keeping things from us is not
going to help solve this case.

426
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,250
And you think sharing
confidential files with,

427
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,940
I don't know, a consultant, will?

428
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,546
Yes, it will. So, tag her in and
let her show you what she can do.

429
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,166
You know, it's starting to
feel like when I left this place,

430
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,996
you lost your mind.

431
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,990
You know what, Ronnie?
I'll make you a deal.

432
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,896
You show us all your intel,

433
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,410
and if we come up empty,
we'll back off the case.

434
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,620
What do you say?

435
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,100
Meet me in my office.

436
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,550
You come up short, you're out.

437
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,816
Look, I don't care who gets
credit for solving this case,

438
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,430
I just want it solved.

439
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,206
Don't let personal feelings get in the way

440
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,236
of figuring out who killed an son.

441
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,300
- I hear you, but...
- but what?

442
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,100
The FBI has information
that we need to see, Selena.

443
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,936
That Morgan needs to see.

444
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,456
How else are we
gonna get our hands on it

445
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,936
unless I offered up something in return?

446
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,906
Fine. I know your history.

447
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,216
If you have something to prove,

448
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,766
you better not let it get
in the way of this case.

449
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,110
I will never let that happen.

450
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,356
But right now, we're
just a distraction for him,

451
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,806
especially Morgan.

452
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,776
He sees her exactly
the same way I used to

453
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,670
before I realized how
valuable she really is.

454
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,870
And I know it's a big risk,
but it's one I'm willing to take.

455
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,670
Let's hope it pays off.

456
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,640
All right, Morgan.

457
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,440
Here's a handful of terabytes
of information to sift through.

458
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,556
Terabytes. Of course.

459
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,076
You sure you wanna do this?

460
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,340
Yeah. Piece of cake.

461
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,100
What else can you tell her
about the intel before she dives in?

462
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,310
There are roughly a dozen toxicologists

463
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,900
on our radar for various reasons.

464
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,806
My team is still in the
process of discovering

465
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,630
which one might've
had motive to kill an son.

466
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,190
- Hopefully I can help.
- All right. Have at it.

467
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,590
All right. I think I've seen enough.

468
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,756
It's already morning. Maybe
we should get some rest.

469
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,020
You know, there is such a
thing as too much information.

470
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,930
I just wish I had something
a little more concrete.

471
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,340
Well, what about him?
You keep circling back

472
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,030
to this guy over and over again. Why?

473
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,806
Kenneth Sutton was a
board-certified medical toxicologist

474
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,186
at California poison control for a decade.

475
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,180
He quit three years ago and went
off the grid after his daughter died.

476
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,366
Her name was Julie.

477
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,366
- What happened to her?
- She took her own life

478
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,630
when misinformation was spread

479
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,816
about her on an son's AI platform.

480
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,050
- He was 24.
- Okay, well, there's motive.

481
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,856
Yeah, and the FBI
went and visited Kenneth

482
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,160
right after an son's murder.

483
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,066
Did they? It would've been nice if
they'd shared that information with us.

484
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,346
Yeah. And here's the weird thing.

485
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,796
According to their files,

486
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,316
Kenneth only left his
apartment on wednesdays

487
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,106
to go put flowers on his daughter's grave.

488
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,090
You mean no other contact
with the outside world?

489
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,140
It doesn't look like it.

490
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,496
And Ronnie's team pulled these photos

491
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,450
from the surveillance cameras
at the verdugo hills cemetery.

492
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,636
That's it. There's no other
record of him going anywhere

493
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,910
on any other day.

494
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,780
Why would you wear gloves
to put flowers on a grave?

495
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,616
- You wouldn't.
- He's not wearing gloves

496
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,300
at any of these other cemetery visits.

497
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,270
Only this one.

498
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,416
And look at the date.

499
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,936
That's two days before an son's murder.

500
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,386
I think he was wearing gloves
to protect himself from the poison

501
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,790
that he hid in the flowers.

502
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,930
Poison he put there so somebody
else could come and pick it up

503
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,310
and kill an son with it.

504
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:05,326
I don't know how, but I think you did it.

505
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,800
- Let's go talk to Kenneth.
- Yeah.

506
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,150
Good morning.

507
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,616
Hey. How's everyone doing over there?

508
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,290
We're all good here.

509
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,066
Just, trying to feed our
little lady before I do drop-off.

510
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,166
Be right there.

511
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,920
Bet you can imagine why I'm calling.

512
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,656
How late are you gonna be?

513
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,106
It's tough to say.

514
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,176
Are you kidding me?

515
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,386
Are you sure everything's all right?

516
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,976
Yeah, yeah.

517
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Just.

518
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,466
I don't think I can
stay over again tonight.

519
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,496
That's okay. I should be
home by dinner at the latest.

520
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,636
I... I can't clear my whole schedule.

521
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,350
Ludo, I know this is a lot,

522
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,776
but it's kinda what we both signed up for.

523
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,436
No, I know, I know. You're right.

524
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,646
I got it.

525
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,266
Okay. All right, I'll see you tonight.

526
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,850
<i>It's Ronnie. Leave a message.</i>

527
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,626
Hey, Ronnie. We're pretty sure

528
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,176
we know who made the
poison that killed an son.

529
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,650
Guy named Kenneth Sutton.
75 edenhurst, apartment 406.

530
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,146
We're just getting there now.

531
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,170
Call me back.

532
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,086
Kenneth Sutton.

533
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,080
Detective Adam karadec, LAPD.

534
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,266
Need to ask you a couple of questions

535
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,646
about the death of an son Pierce.

536
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,026
- I already spoke to the FBI.
- Yeah, we know you did.

537
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,166
But they didn't ask about the
gloves you were wearing the other day

538
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,350
when you went to put flowers
on your daughter's grave.

539
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,306
We know why you wanted an son dead.

540
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,050
You blamed him for
your daughter's suicide.

541
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,130
Kenneth. Kenneth! Freeze!

542
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,350
Kenneth!

543
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,530
- There he is.
- Hey, freeze!

544
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,196
No, no, don't do it! Your
leg will never make it!

545
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,780
My god!

546
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,950
Damn it, Kenneth.

547
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,890
Let's see what Kenneth's
apartment has to say.

548
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,100
This feels awful.

549
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,310
Did you know that deep fake video

550
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,350
of Julie was only 31 seconds long?

551
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,566
It took one bully less than a minute

552
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,916
to ruin her life with an son's app.

553
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,080
Yeah, that's the world we live in now.

554
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,056
Well, please remind me to throw
my 15-year-old daughter's phone

555
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,166
in the trash when I get home.

556
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,220
Looks like your profile
on the killer was right.

557
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,980
A shut-in who hated an son.

558
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,346
Yeah, but I don't think I could've
predicted he was a butterfly.

559
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,546
- A butterfly?
- Yeah.

560
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,346
Everyone has got a
different organizing style.

561
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,370
<i>Like, ladybugs prefer
to have lots of storage</i>

562
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,550
<i>to hide their mess.</i>

563
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,510
Now, bees.

564
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,216
<i>Bees build their hives
very structured and efficient.</i>

565
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,380
<i>So the bee organizing style
is much more methodical.</i>

566
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,086
Whereas crickets like to have
things very neat and orderly,

567
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,606
<i>with just a couple of
sentimental items front and center.</i>

568
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,490
And, what's a butterfly?

569
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,010
Butterflies like to have
everything out in the open

570
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,500
so there's quick and
easy access to everything.

571
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,090
Much like Kenneth does. Or did.

572
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:12,896
Now, I am a ladybug and
you, my friend, you're a cricket.

573
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,586
- Morgan.
- We can talk about it later.

574
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:17,036
- Or never.
- I'll probably squeeze it in somewhere.

575
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,796
So while it might look on the outside

576
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,796
like Kenneth was a pack rat, he's not.

577
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,410
Everything here was important
to him. Everything had purpose.

578
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,596
Well, let's just hope we
can find something here

579
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,460
which leads us to whoever
he was working with.

580
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,140
No TV, no computer.

581
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,290
No technology of any kind,

582
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,466
so he must've been partnering
with somebody who's tech-savvy,

583
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,910
someone like Simon.

584
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,506
Looks like the FBI just landed.

585
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,740
I'll handle this. Should be fun.

586
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,190
Tell me it's not true.
Our suspect is dead?

587
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,546
We tried to stop it.

588
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,260
You shouldn't have tried anything!

589
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,710
I called you. You didn't answer.

590
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,486
As I predicted, Morgan came through.

591
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,680
Now we're even further
away from solving this case.

592
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,626
Or are we one step
closer to solving this case?

593
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,836
What? You got a
confession before he jumped?

594
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,860
Ronnie.

595
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,046
Come on, brother.

596
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,620
We can't keep working like this.

597
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,776
I can admit maybe I was letting
some of the past get in the way

598
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,350
of how I was handling the case.

599
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,636
That's on me.

600
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,840
But the bottom line is,
this thing that we're doing,

601
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,956
it's not good for either side.

602
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,880
There shouldn't be any sides, man!

603
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,300
I walked right into that one, didn't I?

604
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,200
You know, I still know you pretty well.

605
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,006
And that's why I know
you wanna solve this case

606
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:29,386
just as badly as we do
and for all the right reasons.

607
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,590
Just like we used to do back in the day.

608
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,620
You were always the calm one.

609
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:38,900
Apparently, I still am.

610
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:44,180
All right, man. Look, let's
just, process the scene,

611
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,536
see if we can find anything

612
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,600
that leads us to whoever
Kenneth was working with.

613
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,926
Hey, Morgan. Ronnie's
team is pulling security footage

614
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,826
from verdugo hills cemetery to
see who picked up that poison.

615
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,850
Great.

616
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,596
Let's just hope whoever it was didn't
know there were security cameras,

617
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,526
or they would've made sure we
couldn't get a good look at 'em.

618
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,550
Yeah, here's hoping.

619
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,380
You miss it, don't you?

620
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,250
Being his partner.

621
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,250
It's okay. I'm not gonna
have hurt feelings if you do.

622
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,986
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do miss the guy.

623
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,056
I mean, he was more than
my partner. He was my friend.

624
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,950
So, you just don't like how it ended?

625
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,136
We had a few bad
seeds in the department

626
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,330
who wanted to see the
two top detectives go down.

627
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,656
Some evidence went
missing from one of our cases,

628
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,386
pretty large sum of money
from the crime scene.

629
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,130
I guess it looked like
we were on the take.

630
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,946
Okay, you don't wanna talk about it.

631
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:44,970
That's okay.

632
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,050
It was an honest mistake, Morgan.

633
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,250
The money was incorrectly
logged into the evidence file.

634
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,026
One wrong digit, a nine
that should've been a zero,

635
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,020
and it looked like we
had stolen the money.

636
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,360
Things got messy, rumors started flying,

637
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,610
Ronnie saw an opportunity
at the FBI and he took it.

638
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,446
Took it and ran. Left me
to clear both of our names,

639
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,650
which I did.

640
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,680
Weathered the storm,
but I definitely got wet.

641
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,356
People around here
didn't look at me the same

642
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,696
for a long time after that.

643
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,146
Even though you didn't
do anything wrong?

644
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,380
And Ronnie, he was gone.

645
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
Wait a minute.

646
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,970
What's this? What are you...

647
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,800
What are you doing?
What's your face doing?

648
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,606
Pretty sure that's what my face
looks like when I've got something.

649
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,630
Do you have something?

650
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,376
We thought an son was
in some kind of altercation

651
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,570
the day he died, right?

652
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,430
Yeah. What, you don't?

653
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,966
I mean, if he didn't mention
it to his security team,

654
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,400
the team he paid to keep him safe,

655
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,400
then maybe these marks on his body...

656
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,610
Weren't from a fight.

657
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,070
You think he was in a
different kind of encounter.

658
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,906
One where he was a willing participant?

659
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,496
Well, that two-hour mystery meeting.

660
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,116
Sounds like we need to talk to the person

661
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,496
he was meeting with in orange county.

662
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,636
Yeah. I'm gonna get
Ronnie's help on this.

663
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,056
Have him get some footage of
the back exit of the office building.

664
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,716
I think that an son was
just passing through

665
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,810
on his way to a more
comfortable spot for his "meeting."

666
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,686
Adam and Morgan, welcome back.

667
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,996
Nice work to our partners at the LAPD

668
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,346
who helped to lead us to Aria vale.

669
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,276
She checked into the
borzi hotel in orange county

670
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,060
- the night before an son's death.
- What do we know about her?

671
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,030
Well, she runs a nonprofit

672
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,596
that tries to regulate
AI in online technology.

673
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,310
And she made no
secret about her desire

674
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,620
to shut down an son's company.

675
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,946
We think she might have found
another way to shut him down.

676
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,126
- Yeah.
- I have so many questions for this woman.

677
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,790
Well, so do I. Which
is why I have a team

678
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,250
tracking her down as we speak.

679
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,630
Give me a second.

680
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,886
- Hi.
- Mom. It's dad.

681
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,740
- He... he just...
- wait. Elliot?

682
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,376
Honey, slow down. What's going on?

683
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,756
He just collapsed.

684
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,950
<i>What? Is he breathing?</i>

685
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,416
You know what? I'm
gonna call 911, okay?

686
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,750
No. No ambulance. It's okay. I'm fine.

687
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,696
He keeps saying no.
What do you want us to do?

688
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,696
<i>Keep an eye on him, all right?
Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

689
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
I'll be right there.

690
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,660
Thanks.

691
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,986
Hey. Are you okay?

692
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,916
I think I recognize that voice.

693
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,320
Is that the mother of my children?

694
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,530
- What happened?
- I got lightheaded and I fainted.

695
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
But I'm fine, really.

696
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,516
- Okay. Is Chloe down?
- Yeah, she's asleep.

697
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,540
- Where's Elliot?
- He's outside on the porch.

698
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,160
Okay. Can you give us a second?

699
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,906
- Do you... You wanna talk about it?
- Not really. No.

700
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:39,000
Look, I was probably dehydrated
and didn't eat enough food.

701
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,900
- But I'm good now.
- I'm sorry.

702
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,490
Why are you sorry?
None of this is your fault.

703
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,436
I'm just having you do
so much with the kids,

704
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,166
and you're really picking
up the slack around here.

705
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,390
- I just feel really bad...
- yeah, because I want to.

706
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,126
When you and I split up,

707
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,470
we agreed we're gonna
remain a family no matter what.

708
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,750
That's what I'm doing.

709
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,540
I know. And I couldn't
do this without you.

710
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,160
And I don't want to.

711
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,340
I feel the same.

712
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,790
Thanks.

713
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,696
I'm gonna go check on Elliot.

714
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,860
Yeah, please do. I think
he's a little freaked out.

715
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,946
I know that the two of
you remember everything

716
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,046
that ever happened,

717
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,876
but if you can find a
way to erase the memory

718
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,636
of his father face-planting
on the kitchen tile,

719
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,660
I'd really appreciate it.

720
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,560
Sorry I missed it.

721
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,980
You need a blanket out here?

722
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,710
I'm okay.

723
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,030
That was pretty scary?

724
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,410
Yeah. You know what?
Your dad is just fine.

725
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,386
But I'll have him go
to the doctor tomorrow,

726
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,410
just to be safe.

727
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,410
They should probably
order an mri, or an echo.

728
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,620
I read that dizziness could be
a sign of a silent heart attack,

729
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:51,250
or a coronary spasm that can
lead to a myocardial infarction.

730
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,360
The Internet's a dangerous place.

731
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,190
Apparently, so is our kitchen.

732
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,090
You're worrying, I can tell.

733
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,920
It's okay. I'm worried too.

734
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,276
- You are?
- Yeah.

735
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,581
Sometimes my mind can take
me to places I don't wanna go.

736
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,170
Does that ever happen to you?

737
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,696
It did today.

738
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,310
Yeah, thoughts are hard to control.

739
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,900
You know, especially when
you've got a brain like you and I do.

740
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,520
But we are in charge.

741
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,326
And the trick is to focus
on the stuff that you do want,

742
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,970
not the stuff that you don't.

743
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,430
I don't think I can.

744
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,740
It's not always easy. I know.

745
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,446
But I guess we gotta ask ourselves,

746
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,950
do we wanna be scared,

747
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,826
or do we want to notice
all of the wonderful things

748
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,440
that are happening right around us?

749
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,990
Like what?

750
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,340
Like the fact that my son called me today

751
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,000
'cause his dad needed help,
and that made me so proud.

752
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,256
Like the fact that we're all here tonight

753
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,690
under one roof, safe and sound.

754
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,970
But for tonight, you're all mine.

755
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,980
And I'm grateful for that.

756
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
Me too.

757
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,096
Okay, okay, I can't breathe.

758
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,360
You can breathe fine.

759
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,630
If you couldn't breathe,
you wouldn't be able to talk.

760
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,966
Anson felt that you were resisting

761
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,726
the inevitable evolution

762
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,626
of humans and technology together.

763
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:26,480
He said, quote, "Aria vale fears
the inevitable and hates freedom."

764
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,256
<i>Look, we met up a few times
to try to find common ground.</i>

765
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
And?

766
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,650
We both decided that we
were wasting each other's time.

767
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,010
- Here it comes.
- Here comes what?

768
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,190
One word.

769
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,670
You familiar with the getty kouros?

770
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,190
The ancient sculpture?

771
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,370
Well, people thought it was,

772
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:53,540
until a famous art scholar
by the name of Pierre Paul

773
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,650
took one look at it and uttered one word,

774
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,006
"fake."

775
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,690
No proof, just his intuition.

776
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,380
Old Pierre had the ability
to identify what was real

777
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,900
and what wasn't based on a gut feeling.

778
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,420
Okay.

779
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,080
I can do it too.

780
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:16,740
You know what word comes
to mind when I see you?

781
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,740
"Liar."

782
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,820
<i>Now you're acting surprised.</i>

783
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,890
It never gets old.

784
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,826
<i>And I ain't buying that either.</i>

785
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,410
So what do you say? You
ready to start telling me the truth?

786
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:37,456
During one of our
meetings, things got heated.

787
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,116
<i>That's how he got the
bruises on his neck and wrists?</i>

788
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,140
<i>Yes.</i>

789
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,970
<i>A collar and wrists restraints.</i>

790
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,056
You know, a guy dies from
poison just hours after you saw him.

791
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,290
I didn't poison him.

792
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,200
Well, can you explain this?

793
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,406
That's from my earring.

794
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:56,230
It poked him, and we laughed about it.

795
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,880
Anything else you wanna tell me?

796
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,656
Yeah.

797
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,130
I think I need a lawyer.

798
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,316
Based on cell tower triangulation,

799
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,866
neither Simon nor Aria came
anywhere near Julie's grave

800
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,316
in the days leading
up to an son's murder.

801
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,696
So neither of them are
the person in this photo

802
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,790
retrieving the poison.

803
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,806
You know, unless maybe
they pulled that trick

804
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,736
that we came across with our suspect

805
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,000
in the pawn shop homicide case?

806
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,886
He left his cell at home to shore
up his alibi. Remember that one?

807
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,010
You mean Abe's smoke shop
murder on crenshaw boulevard.

808
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,786
No, I'm certain it was
Mr. P's pawn on centinela.

809
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,196
- You wanna make this interesting?
- What are we making interesting?

810
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,026
Welcome back. Is ludo okay?

811
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,716
Yes. Thank you. Where are we?

812
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,330
We're still trying to connect
Aria or Simon to Kenneth.

813
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,040
Yeah, but I think it may be time
to open it up to other suspects.

814
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,386
I just don't buy that Kenneth
didn't have more contact

815
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,176
- with whoever he was working with.
- Yeah. I agree.

816
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,076
But there's no evidence
that he met with anyone else.

817
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,480
I mean, we checked his
friends, his family, his colleagues.

818
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,970
But Kenneth was a butterfly.

819
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,256
- A what?
- His organizing style.

820
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,946
Everything in his place had purpose.

821
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,916
See these books right here?

822
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,706
I mean, they look completely untouched.

823
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,250
Hard copies still wrapped in plastic.

824
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,716
- Louisa may alcott.
- You familiar?

825
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,810
Enough to know one of
her most famous quotes.

826
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,130
"It takes two flints to make a fire."

827
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,556
Yeah, I think those books
belonged to Kenneth's daughter.

828
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,386
Parker had a flint
hanging on his key chain,

829
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,626
<i>most likely a gift from Julie.</i>

830
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,650
I bet there's more than just a spark

831
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,456
between him and our
Louisa may alcott enthusiast.

832
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,946
I think Julie and Parker were
in a relationship when she died.

833
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:27,466
Okay. So you're saying Kenneth
and Parker hatched a plan

834
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,776
to kill an son in
retribution for Julie's death.

835
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,150
Makes perfect sense.

836
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,716
Parker had the credentials to work
his way onto an son's security detail.

837
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,266
And we know Kenneth made the poison.

838
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,236
<i>Kenneth had dog collars
in his apartment but no dog.</i>

839
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,616
<i>I bet the poison was
placed in the dog collar</i>

840
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,066
<i>and hidden inside the flowers</i>

841
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,996
<i>that Kenneth left at Julie's grave.</i>

842
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,540
<i>Parker must've picked up the flowers</i>

843
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,176
<i>and put the collar on an son's dog,</i>

844
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,580
<i>which made contact
with his skin on the flight.</i>

845
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,690
Time for him to tell us.

846
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,736
- Karadec, we got a big problem.
- How big?

847
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,110
My apprehension team
just made it to Parker's hotel.

848
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,250
He must have seen us
coming 'cause he's long gone.

849
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,816
Can you do some sort of satellite
facial tracking or something?

850
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,560
- Yeah, already in the works.
- Screen two.

851
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,026
Our problem is about
to get a whole lot bigger

852
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,516
if he's heading back to the valley airport.

853
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,940
Anson's jet is still there. He
could be making a run for it.

854
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,446
We'll tag in TSA to stop him.

855
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,780
- <i>Forrester.
- Daphne, I need you here. Now.</i>

856
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:20,920
<i>Got it. On my way.</i>

857
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,270
Hey.

858
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,046
No communication with air
traffic control. Understand?

859
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,080
All right.

860
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,986
Just like old times.

861
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,180
And new times.

862
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,700
Let's just hope this plan works.

863
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,290
Let's go, let's go!

864
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,686
How long till we're in the air?

865
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,050
Five minutes or so.

866
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,206
Daphne, how we looking?

867
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,300
We're doing our best.
Simon's a little frazzled.

868
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,246
This is incredibly challenging.

869
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,626
Keep trying. We're running out of time.

870
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,170
Yeah, I can see that.

871
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,720
- Come on! Go, go! Go!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

872
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,620
- What did you do?
- Nothing. Nothing, I swear.

873
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:09,590
- Why did that happen?
- I don't know. Everything just shut down.

874
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,956
- Freeze!
- Hold it!

875
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,096
LAPD!

876
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,336
FBI!

877
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,786
- Drop it!
- Drop the weapon now!

878
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,306
- Put the weapon down!
- Parker, put the gun on the ground.

879
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,330
Do it! Now!

880
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,180
Unless you wanna meet
Kenneth on the other side.

881
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,396
- Team, move in.
- You're covered.

882
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,420
Stay on him.

883
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,770
Cuff him.

884
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,770
All right, move.

885
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,516
First time hacking into the
motherboard of an airplane?

886
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,780
First and last.

887
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,990
Pretty nice view, right?

888
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,246
I've seen better.

889
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,000
Here. Souvenir.

890
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,456
You know, I almost
took one of these earlier.

891
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,720
Almost.

892
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,830
Thanks.

893
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,326
I'm sure you saw the press
release from an son's mother.

894
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,450
- I did.
- Yeah.

895
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,846
Well, it looks like she's gonna lobby

896
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,846
to regulate all of her son's platforms.

897
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,226
Hopefully there's not another tragedy

898
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,366
like Julie's in the future.

899
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,390
Amen to that.

900
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,880
I'm sorry, Adam.

901
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,546
I probably should've
said that a while ago,

902
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,370
but turns out I'm even
more stubborn than you are.

903
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,990
Yeah, man, I.

904
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,580
I saw an exit, and I took it.

905
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,696
And I left you to clean
up the mess for both of us,

906
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,720
which you did.

907
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,760
But in many ways,

908
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,496
you're the reason I'm here.

909
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,186
Nah, you would've still
made it on your own,

910
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,210
even without my help.

911
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,040
Yeah, probably would've.

912
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,180
- But I still owe you one.
- No, you do not.

913
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,290
I do.

914
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,436
Which is why I'd like
to put in a word for you

915
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,190
with the special agent in charge.

916
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,370
So, what do you say?

917
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,200
Morgan, I need to tell you something.

918
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,216
Ronnie offered me a job.

919
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,600
He wants to partner with me again.

920
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,590
Wow.

921
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,250
- What did you say?
- I said no.

922
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,056
Okay, when I worked at the dmv,

923
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,196
and a big rig driver named Rufus

924
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,336
suggested that I'd be a
pretty decent long-hauler

925
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,066
I at least slept on it

926
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,570
before I told him, "absolutely not."

927
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,990
I don't need to sleep on it.
This is where I wanna be.

928
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,470
And I have a new partner now.

929
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,416
- What did you just say?
- You heard me.

930
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,626
I mean, plus, you saw the FBI, Morgan.

931
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,146
I mean, the gadgets, the tech,

932
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,526
the bells, the whistles, it would...

933
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,116
It would make our job
way too easy, wouldn't it?

934
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,310
Yeah, yeah.

935
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,466
I mean, how we gonna,
you know, take all the credit

936
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,846
and brag about everything if the
computers are doing all the work?

937
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,056
That's what I'm saying.

938
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,180
All right. Well...

939
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,530
Then I guess I'll see
you tomorrow, partner.

940
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,570
I'll be here.

941
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:18,996
Yeah.

942
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,686
This seems like a bad idea.

943
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,276
I don't think you have enough
information to determine that.

944
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,556
Hey, hey, no peeking.

945
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,626
I'm not! I'm not.

946
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:28,860
Okay. Ready?

947
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
Take it off.

948
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,620
Ta-da!

949
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:36,140
I thought I smelled tacos.

950
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,800
Mom even got those nachos
with the disgusting cheese you like.

951
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:41,490
It's called queso oaxaca.

952
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,320
She's letting us eat on the
coach. And we're watching 2001?

953
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,770
<i>A space odyssey? With all of us?</i>

954
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,786
If the kids can get
through the monkey part.

955
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,686
It's not a documentary, is it?

956
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,370
God forbid you learn something.

957
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,950
Thank you.

958
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,510
You got it.

959
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,866
We're all so busy.

960
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,300
We gotta remember to slow
down and appreciate each other.

961
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,960
I'm glad you're okay, dad.

962
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,650
Hey, me too, buddy.

963
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,170
- Can I press play?
- Go nuts.

964
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,776
- Boy.
- Ew. No. Gross.

965
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,676
Use a fork or something.
Seriously, who raised you?

966
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,086
I had nothing to do with it.

967
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,156
Don't look at me. That is
kinda gross, buddy. Here.

968
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,336
My god. What have I gotten myself into?

969
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,856
So good, right?
