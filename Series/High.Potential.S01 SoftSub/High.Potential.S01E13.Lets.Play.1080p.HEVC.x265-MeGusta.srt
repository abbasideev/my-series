1
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,390
I always knew this
day would come, right?

2
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,600
And I did everything I
could to prepare, I just

3
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,780
don't worry, mom. She'll be fine.

4
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,920
And let's remember to keep
those hands at 9:00 and 3:00.

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,370
Nine and what?

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,820
I'm kidding. Relax, I got this.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,720
Okay.

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,730
So, why don't we stop up here, and
we'll practice your parallel parking?

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,210
Good, good, good.

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,040
Okay, so check in the mirrors...

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,700
- Okay. Yep.
- Put it in reverse...

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,630
You should probably lower the
deductible on our car insurance.

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,130
What happened to "she'll be fine"?

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,080
- Pop it? No.
- All right, keep going.

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,700
- Going harder right.
- Harder right.

16
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,880
- A little fast... Too fast!
- Sorry, mom.

17
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,570
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Wait, wait, turn!

18
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,990
License plate is 2ddt456.

19
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,250
I'm confused. You want us
to pull over your daughter?

20
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,610
We're not traffic cops, Morgan.

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,750
- Good morning.
- Morning.

22
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,036
Ava doesn't even have her license yet.

23
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,510
No, she doesn't,

24
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,596
but my daughter and I are
much more alike than she thinks,

25
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,480
and trust me, when
her license does land...

26
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,220
Hey, don't make me slam
these brakes, you thirsty bitches.

27
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,770
Whoa, the back seat is very...

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,630
- Spacious?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,390
Whatcha got, five-o? Let's do this.

30
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,670
Whoo!

31
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,050
We just all need to be prepared, okay?

32
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,330
All right, listen up.

33
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,370
Some of you have yet
to rsvp for the police gala,

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
and you know who you are.

35
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,130
I got that email.

36
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,510
I got that too. What is that though?

37
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,370
It's an annual gathering of city officials,

38
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,680
detectives, officers.

39
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,130
Decent music, open bar till 10:00. Right?

40
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,760
Sorry, lieutenant. I have plans.

41
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,280
Change 'em.

42
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,210
I want the top brass to see
all of major crimes represented.

43
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,900
So that means every single one of you

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,210
is going to be there and looking sharp.

45
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,290
I'm only going to see if oz makes
a fool of himself again this year.

46
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,630
I knocked over one ice
sculpture four years ago.

47
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,986
Daph won't let me live it down.

48
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,676
There's photos, if you
ever wanna see 'em.

49
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,470
Of course I wanna see 'em.

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,850
Detective karadec.

51
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,990
No, I did not. You just sent it?

52
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,610
Okay, we'll check it out. Thanks.

53
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,230
- Everything okay?
- LAPD tip line

54
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,820
flagged an email to major
crimes that just came in.

55
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,690
"Spencer Wallace wouldn't
play with me, will you?"

56
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,280
Open the attachment.

57
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,970
"Two hours to make your move."

58
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,950
"Two hours to make your move."

59
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,540
Sounds like some kind of game.

60
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,920
Yeah, a game Spencer here

61
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,276
does not look like he wants to play.

62
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,580
We don't know when it was taken.

63
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,076
We don't know who it is, we
don't know if it was staged.

64
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,346
I mean, for all we know,
this is just someone trying

65
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,720
to send us on a fool's errand.

66
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,690
Found him. Spencer Wallace,
37 years old, born in riverside.

67
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,000
Runs a small interior
design firm. Unmarried.

68
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,186
A couple of parking tickets, that's it.

69
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,620
He's in a room with no windows.

70
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,806
Look, see how the only light's
coming from the camera flash?

71
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,080
Yeah.

72
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,056
Let's hope this is someone's
bad idea of a good time.

73
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,320
- Find out.
- Yeah.

74
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,360
Here you go.

75
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,430
Spencer, it's LAPD!

76
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,190
If you're home, we need you to open up.

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,200
Buildings this nice
usually deliver packages

78
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,580
to the mail room, right?

79
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,340
"Let's play."

80
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,696
Most puzzles will give you a picture

81
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,450
of what it'll look like when it's done.

82
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,040
Well, whoever left this for us

83
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,540
clearly wants us to figure it out.

84
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,900
- Or waste more of our time.
- Only one way to find out.

85
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,050
Okay, give me a minute.

86
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,050
She means that literally, doesn't she?

87
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,550
It looks like an elevation map.
Contour lines, color gradients.

88
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,936
Yeah, yeah, and these could be roads.

89
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,356
That's definitely Mulholland trail.

90
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,620
I hiked up there last week.

91
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,140
- One piece is missing.
- Maybe it fell?

92
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,350
No, I don't think so.

93
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,396
That's part of the game.
It's missing on purpose.

94
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,086
Whoever took Spencer
Wallace wants us to try

95
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,560
and find him right here.

96
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,200
Then that's exactly what we're gonna do.

97
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,266
Oz and Daphne, find
out everything you can

98
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,400
about Spencer Wallace.

99
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,980
You two go for a hike.

100
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,650
So we're looking for what exactly?

101
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,200
You know, probably nothing.

102
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,036
We get thousands of
calls like this a week.

103
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,480
People get a kick out of sending
cops on wild goose chases.

104
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,450
Makes you feel grumpy?

105
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,596
All right. So what games
did you play as a kid?

106
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,350
Yahtzee. Yahtzee was my jam.

107
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,250
- Yahtzee? What?
- Yeah.

108
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,040
Okay, it is painfully clear

109
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,140
I will not be inviting you
to my next game night.

110
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,980
Looks like you won't have to.

111
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,850
"Loco ocho." You have to
match the color or the number,

112
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,470
and try to get rid of all your cards.

113
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,556
I don't like it when
you're impressed by me

114
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,300
when I haven't done
anything impressive.

115
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,520
"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
Pick a card and then you'll go.

116
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,170
Down a path and through the shade.

117
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,040
Before dear Spencer starts to fade."

118
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,420
Yeah, see how this
path veers off into two?

119
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,116
Yeah. You take one, I'll take the other.

120
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,830
I don't think it's gonna be that simple.

121
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,886
You telling me we gotta play a game

122
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,320
to figure out which one to take?

123
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,150
The two-hour countdown
started when the email came in.

124
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,530
We have 34 minutes to make our move.

125
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,710
Last card's a two. Okay.

126
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,430
That must mean we
take the second path.

127
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,376
How do you know there weren't
other outcomes to these hands?

128
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,200
- You wanna play again?
- Absolutely not.

129
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,640
Hey, we're still searching out here.

130
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,510
<i>Daphne and oz found Insulin shots</i>

131
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,866
in Spencer Wallace's apartment.

132
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,140
Our Vic is a diabetic.

133
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,480
That means two hours could
be how much time he has

134
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,210
before going into diabetic
ketoacidosis without it.

135
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,706
That gives us just under half an hour

136
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,730
before Spencer could die.

137
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,870
This is real.

138
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,080
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

139
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,250
You got something?

140
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,150
She's got something.

141
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,740
It's addition and multiplication.

142
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,470
It's either hopscotch for hikers,

143
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,680
or hopscotch for second
grade algebra teachers.

144
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,760
It's azimuth and elevation.

145
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,350
- Telling us where to go?
- No, telling us where to look:

146
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,940
240 degrees and a negative ten.

147
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,180
The horizontal direction
and vertical angle.

148
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,530
"Valley day storage."

149
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,260
And you know what
storage units never have?

150
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,990
Windows.

151
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,090
Everybody start banging
on doors. Use your ears.

152
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,200
- Spencer!
- Spencer! Spencer.

153
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,650
- Spencer!
- Spencer!

154
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,100
- Spencer!
- Spencer!

155
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Spencer!

156
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,070
- Spencer!
- Spencer!

157
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,420
Spencer.

158
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,210
Spencer, you in there?

159
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,970
Unit l4! L4!

160
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,630
The manager said he rents unit l4. Daph!

161
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,110
This is it. This is him. Spencer?

162
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,630
Spencer? Spencer, can you hear us?

163
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,050
Spencer?

164
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,880
Spencer. Hey, buddy. Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

165
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,260
Hey. We're with the LAPD.

166
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,616
Paramedics are on their
way. You're gonna be okay.

167
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,236
I have your Insulin from your apartment.

168
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,376
I'm gonna administer
it in your arm, okay?

169
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,610
Okay.

170
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,170
Thank you.

171
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,800
I wish I didn't remember, but... I do.

172
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,830
It's okay. Take your time.

173
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,490
I was walking up to my apartment
when someone came up behind me.

174
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,360
It happened so fast I
didn't even see their face

175
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
before they got some bag over my head.

176
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,300
And when it came off, I
was in this dark room...

177
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,300
Then what happened?

178
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,680
They made me play games.

179
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,720
At least, they tried to make me play.

180
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,310
I was shaking too much.

181
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,316
<i>I mean, they're moving these
pieces around a game board</i>

182
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,970
<i>while I'm begging for my life.</i>

183
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,830
I... I was too scared to play.

184
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,156
Did you get a look at the person?

185
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,520
They were wearing a white anime mask.

186
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,840
Rosy cheeks, real big eyes.

187
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,910
The room was too dark
to see anything else.

188
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,196
- And what about the sound of their voice?
- They never spoke.

189
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,886
Whoever they were, they must
not have been having much fun.

190
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,400
Why do you say that?

191
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,476
Well, they got frustrated I
wasn't taking the game seriously

192
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,190
and they knocked me out. I
woke up in my storage unit.

193
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,440
Yeah, about that storage
unit. Why is it empty?

194
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,966
Like, usually people get a storage unit

195
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,110
and they fill it with stuff.

196
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,580
I rented it with James.

197
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,310
He was my partner for nine years.

198
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,580
"Was" your partner?

199
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,280
This June will be four
years since his car accident.

200
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,800
I'm so sorry.

201
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,690
We had big plans.

202
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,490
We needed a place to put our things

203
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,900
when we traveled the world,

204
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,040
so we... Rented that unit.

205
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,910
I know it's silly, I just.

206
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,260
I haven't been ready to let it go.

207
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,470
I don't think it's silly at all.

208
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,680
Spencer, is there anyone
you can imagine doing this?

209
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,710
Maybe someone who
wanted to hurt you?

210
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,230
I don't know.

211
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,550
Whoever abducted Spencer
wanted us to find him.

212
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,216
They could've killed him but they didn't,

213
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,076
'cause they're playing
a game with us, not him.

214
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,736
I think we should be looking
for someone who has a grudge

215
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,790
against the LAPD.

216
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,350
Maybe, but I don't know.

217
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,070
Look at these clues.

218
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,390
Puzzle, loco ocho, hopscotch.
These are kids' games.

219
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,730
I think he just wants to play.

220
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,086
So we're looking for a five-year-old.

221
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,716
So we just wait for
the next clue to arrive?

222
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,810
We gotta do something.

223
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,500
We can't work with leads we don't have.

224
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,370
Gillory...

225
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,720
Here we go.

226
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,270
- Thanks, Katie.
- Of course.

227
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,170
It's already been paid for.

228
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,350
What do you mean?

229
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,450
Thanks.

230
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,360
How did you know I'd be here?

231
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,090
Heard you had a standing
order on Thursdays for the family.

232
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,160
Relax, you're not special.

233
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,750
I know a lot of things
about a lot of people.

234
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,260
Sit down.

235
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,170
I'm guessing you're
not here for the soup.

236
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,936
Is Roman one of those
people? Did you find him?

237
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,970
First things first, I only
wanna deal with you, all right?

238
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,000
'Cause I know your cop friends
have a hand in this, I get it,

239
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,520
but I can't be seen with them

240
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,460
for reasons that don't concern you.

241
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,560
Now Roman came to me
before he went missing.

242
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,080
Said he was afraid for himself, for you.

243
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,600
Yeah, you already said that.

244
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,926
And now I'm telling you it has
something to do with a woman

245
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,230
I heard he was working with at the time.

246
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,306
Roman was a painter. He
didn't have any partners.

247
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,640
All I know is her name is Lila Flynn.

248
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,680
F-I-y-n-n.

249
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,940
You need to write that down.

250
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,030
- I'm good, thanks.
- Right.

251
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,930
I heard about this hpi you have.

252
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,420
That really a thing?

253
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,310
It's a thing that doesn't concern you.

254
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,800
That's all I have on Lila.

255
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,560
But, you know, I'll keep digging.

256
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,430
How do I know that?

257
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,646
I don't know anything about
you except what you told me.

258
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,856
How am I supposed to believe you?

259
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,330
Because you got nobody else.

260
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,540
Or you wouldn't be here.

261
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,370
Put your number in it.

262
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,510
So I can get in touch with you if I
find out more about this Lila Flynn.

263
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,390
Ava, dinner's here!

264
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,570
- So is your mom.
- Hey, how was your day?

265
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,020
I think it ruined family
game night forever.

266
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,190
This kidnapper is really toying with us.

267
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,370
That's a bummer.

268
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,850
Ooh, sweet potato fries.

269
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,030
Good. You're home.

270
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,890
I just finished something
I wanna show you.

271
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,000
Me?

272
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,860
The rest are for dad.

273
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,350
Organizing it by year

274
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,350
seemed super lame,
so I kinda did chapters.

275
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,900
Like, my artwork,

276
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,840
fashion evolution, life milestones.

277
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,290
Is that this morning?

278
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,366
You're lucky I didn't get a
photo of your worried face.

279
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,780
I wasn't worried.

280
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,446
You almost murdered your entire family,

281
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,710
there was no time to worry.

282
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,830
- How far does this go back?
- All the way to the beginning.

283
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,300
Aw, look at that cowboy hat.

284
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,610
- I loved that hat on you.
- Yeah, mom.

285
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,866
Real shame you don't get to
dress me like that anymore.

286
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,450
I think these photos are a reminder

287
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,960
of why you lost that privilege.

288
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,666
All right, take it easy. You're adorable.

289
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,690
What are these for? You hate
when I pull out baby pictures.

290
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,630
You know, in case you find him.

291
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,150
You made this for your dad?

292
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,500
I mean, he missed my entire childhood,

293
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,460
so I figured we'll have to catch him up.

294
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,950
If you find him.

295
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,470
Because maybe your job with the cops

296
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,210
will work out the way you said it would.

297
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,440
I hope so.

298
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,426
You know, speaking of
the cops, they're having

299
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,130
this big, fancy gala, and they invited me.

300
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,790
My god! What are you gonna wear?

301
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,086
I don't know. I haven't thought about it.

302
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,900
Okay, it's only fair.

303
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,760
You got to dress me,
so I get to dress you.

304
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,510
- Am I gonna look good?
- Yes, of course.

305
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,700
Okay.

306
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,920
You came in early.

307
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,060
- I wanted to get a head start.
- You got anything?

308
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,990
No, but we gotta find out who did this

309
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,766
or our victim will be
looking over his shoulder

310
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,790
the rest of his life.

311
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:47,890
I...

312
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,030
Yeah.

313
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,730
All right, all right. We're on our way.

314
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,836
We need to head to the
West Side, to the Marina hotel.

315
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,116
Isn't that where the gala is tomorrow?

316
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,970
Yeah, looks like we have a new lead.

317
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,210
Great.

318
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,360
- Hey.
- Hey.

319
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,360
You actually picked up the phone.

320
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
<i>Yeah. Mistake.</i>

321
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,810
Meant to send you to voicemail,

322
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,740
but I got these long
fingernails, you know?

323
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,710
<i>How are you? How's the new job?</i>

324
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,850
It's intense, but I'm really happy.

325
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,200
I mean, I do miss a few things back in la.

326
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,960
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

327
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,760
So, I was just wondering if you're going

328
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,520
to this police gala tomorrow night?

329
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,940
I am. Why? Did you get an invitation?

330
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,520
I did.

331
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,226
<i>And I thought maybe you
had something to do with that?</i>

332
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,180
Of course I did. I'm very
powerful around here.

333
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,576
<i>- So, you'll be there?
- I will.</i>

334
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,120
Okay. That's all I needed to hear.

335
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,530
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

336
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,260
See you soon.

337
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,430
Morgan.

338
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,540
- Another clue?
- Officer lin called it in.

339
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,090
I knew this wasn't right.

340
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,640
That's not creepy at all.

341
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,240
"The fun has just begun."

342
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,596
We've been asking around to
see if anyone saw who left it here,

343
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,650
but nothing so far.

344
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,040
Okay. So, whoever
kidnapped Spencer isn't done.

345
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,250
And they're watching us.

346
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,390
- Nothing about this is fun.
- Or helpful.

347
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,500
Lab didn't find DNA or prints
on any of the game pieces.

348
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,926
That's because the
kidnapper wants us to play

349
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,400
by their rules not ours.

350
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,400
Something's going on with these dolls.

351
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,820
I mean, every detail the kidnapper's
given us so far has been a clue.

352
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,340
That's how this person
has fun, by making us work.

353
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,930
These babies have to mean something.

354
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,310
I wanna talk to Spencer again.

355
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,450
If he didn't tell anybody
about that storage unit,

356
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,396
that means the kidnapper
must've followed him there, right?

357
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,210
I mean, who else
would've known about it?

358
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,760
I did.

359
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,400
Well, I didn't mention it before

360
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,956
because the group
is meant to be private,

361
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,290
and it didn't seem relevant.

362
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,570
But now, I think it might be.

363
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,090
What is it, oz?

364
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,850
Daph is the only one that knows this,

365
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,710
'cause I don't really talk about it. But.

366
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,790
I lost my dad last year.

367
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,310
Are you okay?

368
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,156
It's weird living in a world
without both of your parents.

369
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,900
So, I started attending
this grief group in echo park.

370
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,220
Everyone who goes has
lost somebody. We just...

371
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,150
We share and, it's... I
don't make it every week.

372
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,170
That's why I didn't
recognize Spencer at first.

373
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,166
But you remembered his
story about losing his partner

374
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,476
and the storage unit
they bought together.

375
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,826
- Yeah.
- And if you knew about it,

376
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:30,996
so does everybody in the group.

377
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,100
Which means any one of them

378
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,656
could be the one playing games with us.

379
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,990
Any idea on a possible suspect?

380
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,470
- No.
- When's the next meeting?

381
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,920
- Later today.
- All right.

382
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,370
You and Daphne go talk
to some group members.

383
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,550
And you two, figure out
what those baby dolls mean.

384
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,550
I want those things out of my bullpen.

385
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,210
- Charles.
- Oz.

386
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,180
Hey.

387
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,396
- We miss seein' you.
- Yeah, same here. How you been?

388
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,050
Not too bad. You
bring a friend for group?

389
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,460
Charles, this is detective forrester.

390
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,400
We're actually here
about a police matter.

391
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,330
We'd like to ask the
group a few questions

392
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,610
if you don't mind.

393
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,710
And if you all don't mind talking with us.

394
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,650
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

395
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:17,030
So you think the person who
kidnapped Spencer met him here?

396
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,696
Do you mind if I ask where you
were Wednesday night around 10:30?

397
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,876
My boyfriend and I went to a movie.

398
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,860
You said 10:30? Let me think.

399
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,970
I stayed in on the couch.

400
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,110
Was anyone with you?

401
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,560
Just my dog. Why?

402
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,220
You remember Spencer?

403
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,150
Spencer? Sweet man.

404
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,910
Is he okay?

405
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,290
I actually had a crush on him,

406
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,780
before I realized I was not his type.

407
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,430
So sad about his partner.

408
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,570
Say, how do you feel about games?

409
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,300
Played left tackle in college.

410
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,920
You cops handing out Lakers' tickets?

411
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,680
What about puzzles? Board games?

412
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,380
I remember one guy who used to
come to group, he just loved 'em.

413
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,480
What was his name?

414
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,000
- David.
- Yeah, David.

415
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,666
He used to always talk
about how much he missed

416
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,030
playing games with his family.

417
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,590
- They died?
- His sister did.

418
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,110
David said his family was
never the same after that,

419
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,560
and no more game nights.

420
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,250
It was like every week he
seemed even more upset about it.

421
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,260
Morgan, what are you doing?

422
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,206
We don't know there's not a
message hidden in here for us.

423
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,780
- In the baby shoes?
- We don't know.

424
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,610
- Was there?
- No.

425
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,300
And now we know. Wait.

426
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,130
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

427
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,060
Gio only wants to talk to you?

428
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,426
- That's what he said.
- Yeah, of course he does.

429
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,736
Gio con forth doesn't
want law enforcement

430
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,960
asking him too many questions,

431
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,040
otherwise his days
as a free man are over.

432
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,860
And what did he say
about this Lila Flynn?

433
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,250
He just gave me her name

434
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,390
and said that she and
Roman were working together.

435
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,940
You hired me because I
notice things that you miss.

436
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,306
You really think I wouldn't sense

437
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,450
if Roman was cheating on me?

438
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,330
Smart people have blind spots too.

439
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,630
And my heart breaks for them.

440
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,610
I think it's time to
cut this gio guy loose.

441
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,370
- He got us a name.
- Yeah, so he says.

442
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,090
And after he disappeared for how long?

443
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,850
- No. He's gotta go.
- Detective.

444
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,550
Gio wasn't my first call or my tenth.

445
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,170
We're investigating a missing person

446
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,860
15 years after the fact.

447
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,146
And whether we like it or not,

448
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,650
gio has connections that we don't.

449
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,450
So we use him for whatever we can.

450
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,180
I agree.

451
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,760
Just please don't trust him.

452
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,040
I won't. I promise.

453
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,700
Okay, our sketch artist is on the way.

454
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,220
What's wrong?

455
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,960
There's this woman.
You remember Sierra.

456
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,540
Never misses a meeting.

457
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,756
She usually arrives early
because she comes from work,

458
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,990
but she's still not here.

459
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,090
- Tell us more about her.
- She's an asl interpreter.

460
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,890
Lives on the West Side.

461
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,340
So, our suspect is a white male,

462
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,310
about 5'10", in his 30s, with a beard.

463
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,370
Great. He could be half
the waiters in the city.

464
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,350
Well, David knew about Spencer's
storage through the grief group,

465
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,460
and was completely
obsessed with games.

466
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,110
All that to recapture

467
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,870
the joy he lost when his sister died?

468
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,226
Yeah, I don't know if I buy that.

469
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,930
This guy loses his sister when he's a kid,

470
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,291
and he just wakes up all
these years later and goes nuts?

471
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,570
Why is he doing this now?

472
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,896
We think because two weeks ago,

473
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,346
he invited the grief group to bar trivia.

474
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,370
No one showed up.

475
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,780
Okay. So David felt rejected,

476
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,610
took his frustrations out on one of them,

477
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,176
and now he's making us play with him.

478
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,766
And Spencer may only be his first victim.

479
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,000
Wait a minute. I think I just
found the missing woman.

480
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,960
Sierra shuman.

481
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,690
That's definitely her.

482
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,240
1459 Santa Monica boulevard.

483
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,900
All right, hurry.

484
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,700
This is her place.

485
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,010
Thanks.

486
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,190
Looks like Sierra put up a fight.

487
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,430
Yeah.

488
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,950
I mean, I'll rush csu,

489
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,336
but going through all
this is gonna take time

490
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,470
we don't have, Morgan.

491
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,340
- That's weird.
- What's weird?

492
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,690
Son of a...

493
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,426
She would never put that
bookshelf there though.

494
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,216
The closet door would
be banging into it all day.

495
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,280
Do you think it was moved?

496
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,940
Turn off the light.

497
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,220
Morgan.

498
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,260
"You can't tell in the dark."

499
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,266
What's something that
you can't see in the dark

500
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,500
but you can in the light?

501
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,950
Other than everything?

502
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Tell.

503
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,130
Yeah?

504
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,240
Well, the word has a bunch
of different meanings, right?

505
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,280
To direct, like to tell someone what to do.

506
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,830
Or to reveal, like a... poker tell.

507
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,870
Or to observe, like,
"can you tell I'm mad?"

508
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,490
Okay. How's this gonna
help us find Sierra, Morgan?

509
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,980
Sierra is an asl interpreter.
Maybe that's why he chose her.

510
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,240
"You can't tell in the dark"

511
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,220
means you can't talk in the dark, right?

512
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,096
You know who can't talk in the dark?

513
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,500
People who are deaf,

514
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,921
because you have to see
sign language in order to use it.

515
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,230
The dolls.

516
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,090
You see their hands?

517
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,300
They're all telling us
something in sign language.

518
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,480
C.

519
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,380
O.

520
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,690
X.

521
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,310
One.

522
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,320
P.

523
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,660
I.

524
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,360
- What does it mean?
- It's not a word.

525
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,780
Pico x1.

526
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,300
Pico and first.

527
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,300
There's an old art gallery
there. Closed a while ago.

528
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,410
Go see if someone
opened it up. Go. Go, go, go.

529
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,380
Clear.

530
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,250
- Help me.
- Wait, listen.

531
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,700
- Help. Please. Help.
- She's locked inside.

532
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,600
I'll get our safe
crackers to break her out.

533
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,190
Paramedics standing by.

534
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,020
She's been in there for 36 minutes.

535
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,686
However much oxygen
that's seeping into this thing,

536
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,850
it can't be much.

537
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,470
Sierra, this is detective
karadec with the LAPD.

538
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,890
I want you to try and stay calm.

539
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,470
Are you able to breathe in there?

540
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,680
Barely.

541
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,550
Please.

542
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,380
SWAT's eta is 45 minutes.

543
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
Help.

544
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,930
It's the art. That's the next game.

545
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,280
- But what game?
- Jacks.

546
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,660
The ball and metal things?

547
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,010
Yep. My dad hated that game.

548
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,620
It's probably why I loved it so much.

549
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,536
The game has different
names all over the world.

550
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,290
<i>The oldest one here being
knucklebones in Central Asia.</i>

551
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,120
They use goat and sheep bones
as the game pieces, ten total.

552
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,780
<i>Next, in south Asia, it's called
anju kal meaning five stones.</i>

553
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,610
And finally, in Japan, they
use bags filled with beans,

554
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,070
specifically seven bags of beans.

555
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,060
So, it's one ball, ten bones,

556
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,100
five stones and seven bags of beans.

557
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,386
That's gotta be the combination.

558
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:38,790
One, ten, five, seven.

559
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,170
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I got you.

560
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,040
I got you. I got you.

561
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,630
You're okay. You're
okay. Hey, you're okay.

562
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,280
Just breathe. Just breathe.

563
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,886
You know, I think this is the first time

564
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,236
I've ever heard you mention your father.

565
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,430
Probably the last.

566
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,300
Fair enough.

567
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,330
So, Jacks?

568
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,990
One day in second grade, at recess,

569
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,936
a group of kids invited
me to come play with them,

570
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,550
which was a really big deal for me.

571
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,660
And it was so fun, and I was so happy.

572
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,030
And I couldn't wait to go
home and tell my dad about it.

573
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,800
- Big mistake.
- Why?

574
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,660
Because it wasn't shogi
or chess, it was Jacks.

575
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,630
A simple game for simpletons.

576
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,150
He said those kids weren't worthy

577
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,700
of my intellectual acumen.

578
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,220
He has hpi too.

579
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,320
So the next day when
they asked me to play again,

580
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,160
I told them why I couldn't, and

581
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,850
- it didn't go well.
- I bet.

582
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,626
Yeah, it quickly spread around the school

583
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,486
that I thought I was
smarter than everyone else,

584
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,890
and that began the nightmare
that was my next four years.

585
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
I'm sorry.

586
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,830
Not your fault.

587
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,970
All right. I've had officers assigned

588
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,510
to every member of the grief group.

589
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,080
Daphne can watch my back.

590
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,730
I always do.

591
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,336
Lieutenant, I'm afraid he's not
gonna stop until he gets a win.

592
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,940
Maybe we should cancel the gala.

593
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,670
No. Nice try though.

594
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,360
Tonight's not just about major crimes,

595
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,540
it's a chance to celebrate law
enforcement across the entire city,

596
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,680
and I'm not going to let this
sicko push us around, all right?

597
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,680
We're gonna put our dancing shoes on,

598
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,230
and we're gonna have a good time.

599
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,590
She's home.

600
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,870
- What are you doing?
- Tell her to hold on a sec.

601
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,396
W-Where's ludo? What's happening?

602
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,706
What you... Why you guys being weird?

603
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,180
Drumroll, please.

604
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,150
- Ta-da!
- We hit the mall.

605
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,700
What is this?

606
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,220
Most of Chloe's college tuition.

607
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,540
Just kidding.

608
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,780
We haven't started
saving yet. But we will.

609
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,890
This is so sweet.

610
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,750
And concerning.

611
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,130
We know the police
gala tonight's a big deal.

612
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,860
And we know you didn't have
time to shop, so everyone chipped in.

613
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,480
Are you serious?

614
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,630
You guys... I don't know what to say.

615
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,366
- Don't say anything. Just try stuff on.
- Yeah.

616
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,940
- Come on. Hurry.
- Okay. Okay.

617
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,460
Don't look at the price tags.

618
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,050
But also don't take them off.

619
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,950
I will not be taking anything off.

620
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,150
- I got these.
- Yes.

621
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,330
Wow.

622
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,780
My kid knows me well.

623
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,020
Yes, she does.

624
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,840
You let her drive to the mall, didn't you?

625
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,960
I did.

626
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,890
You... You wanna talk about it?

627
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,930
Whatever it is?

628
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,790
- Was it obvious?
- No, no, no.

629
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,140
This case. It's just
different than the rest.

630
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,560
- And why is that?
- This person

631
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,390
we're trying to catch is kind of brilliant.

632
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,010
Okay. But so are you.

633
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,550
Yeah, but I don't know how to think

634
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,670
like somebody who would do all of this.

635
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,710
Okay.

636
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,120
Unless you wanna try
on dresses... No, no.

637
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,966
I hope one of them is
a winner. And only one.

638
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,686
- Thank you. Get out.
- Unless you want me to

639
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,030
- I don't.
- I've seen it before.

640
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,790
- Twice.
- And a half.

641
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,930
My god.

642
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,630
Ronnie.

643
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,870
Damn.

644
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:23,400
Wow. This place is a lot
nicer than your last spot.

645
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,290
- Thanks for coming by.
- Wow.

646
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,190
I mean, you really splurged.

647
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,260
What? I can't have nice things now?

648
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,780
Look at you.

649
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,320
You got all dressed up just for me.

650
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,650
This is, for this year's police gala.

651
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,216
Remember when we
used to go to those?

652
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah. Yeah. I remember you, hating 'em.

653
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,140
And me always looking just
a little bit sharper than you.

654
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,040
Well, it's never too
late to rewrite history.

655
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,350
Now, I may or may not have looked

656
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,420
into some things on your behalf.

657
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,180
- And?
- And...

658
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,050
Anything I share didn't come from me.

659
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,530
Say less. I got it. You were never here.

660
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,360
- Okay.
- So what you find?

661
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,190
Lila Flynn was an undercover
field agent for the FBI.

662
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,370
- What?
- Yeah.

663
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,656
It was way before my time at the bureau,

664
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,580
but she handled all kinds of cases.

665
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,320
- Most of which are classified.
- Still?

666
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,650
What else?

667
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,720
She was murdered 15 years ago.

668
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,550
Shot in her own
backyard, execution style.

669
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,140
- Unsolved?
- Ice cold.

670
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,420
But one of the last cases she
was working on involved Roman.

671
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,110
- Roman sinquerra.
- Yeah.

672
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,180
He dropped off the grid
shortly after her death.

673
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,360
But I did a deep dive
and nothing turned up.

674
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,190
Except this.

675
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,260
Read and burn.

676
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,440
Excuse me, ladies,

677
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,540
I'm looking for Selena
soto and Daphne forrester.

678
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,246
- Have you seen them around?
- Ha-ha. Very funny.

679
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,860
Oz fashionably late again?

680
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,116
He has got to spend less
time with his personal grooming.

681
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,736
- I'm gonna call him.
- I'll be right back.

682
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,110
Morgan's not here yet either.

683
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,490
Yeah. I'm sure she'll be easy
to spot when she shows up.

684
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,290
- How you feeling? You all right?
- A little anxious.

685
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,780
I wish we would've caught
our guy before all of this, but...

686
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,230
- We'll catch him soon enough.
- Yeah, we will.

687
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,640
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

688
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,896
Now that I've got some fresh intel

689
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,000
on the Roman investigation.

690
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,100
From who?

691
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,410
Yeah.

692
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,410
- And?
- And it turns out

693
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,070
Roman was working
as an FBI informant.

694
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,946
Now I'll download you
on all the details later,

695
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,216
but for now, I just need to know
I've got your blessing to press ahead.

696
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,630
- Of course.
- Yeah. I'll talk to her.

697
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,490
Good luck.

698
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,300
You look absolutely stunning.

699
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,990
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

700
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,160
My daughter did it.

701
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,400
Can I buy you a drink?

702
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,580
Are they not free?

703
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,060
Yeah, I believe they are.

704
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,940
Hey.

705
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,506
It's been almost an hour and
oz still isn't answering his phone.

706
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,850
It just keeps going to voicemail.

707
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,670
That's not like him.

708
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,650
He lives nearby. I'm
gonna go check in on him.

709
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,440
- All right. Be careful.
- Okay. I will.

710
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,790
You know, we have come
a long way, you and me.

711
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,170
Have we?

712
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,736
Yeah. When you consider it started out

713
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,080
with you tampering with evidence,

714
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,100
and, getting thrown in jail

715
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,590
for taking a swing at
an officer, I'd say so.

716
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,420
All right. Well, for the record,
I was cleared of all charges.

717
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,800
And I helped solve that case.

718
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,196
Yes. And then you went on to solve

719
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,010
about a dozen more cases after that.

720
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,750
And once we put this
joker wannabe away,

721
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,390
we're gonna solve a bunch more cases.

722
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,020
And one of them will be Roman's.

723
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,166
Morgan, listen, I want
you to let me handle things

724
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,230
with gio from now on.

725
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,610
What? No. No.

726
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,440
I know how much this means to you.

727
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,860
That's why it matters to me too.

728
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,720
Well, that's sweet. I appreciate that.

729
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,666
But he was clear he
doesn't wanna deal with cops.

730
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,340
- It has to just be me.
- No.

731
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,830
It's too dangerous, Morgan...

732
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,310
Guys like gio, they're unpredictable.

733
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,946
You need to think
about what you're risking.

734
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,730
No. I will play this the right way.

735
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,840
- I'll get exactly what we need from gio.
- I know what I'm doing.

736
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,620
You need to stop
worrying about me, okay?

737
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,080
Hey, partner.

738
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,260
Trust me, okay?

739
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,410
He wants to meet at his
hotel at 9:00 A.M. tomorrow.

740
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,550
Okay. Got it.

741
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,960
And I do believe someone just walked in

742
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,270
who's looking to see you.

743
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,450
Catch you later.

744
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,590
- You made it.
- I did.

745
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,500
Well, if you're not all danced out

746
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,190
I'm never all danced out.

747
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,470
Oz?

748
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,270
No.

749
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,490
Everything okay?

750
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,050
I'm not leaving until we find oz.

751
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,360
None of us are. Morgan,
what are you thinking?

752
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,990
I'm thinking this puzzle sucks.

753
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,206
Maybe there is no puzzle. He
didn't leave many clues behind.

754
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,826
He would've left enough
clues for it to be solved,

755
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,510
otherwise it wouldn't be a game.

756
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,750
Marco.

757
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,410
- Polo!
- Marco Polo is a kids' game.

758
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,930
No, I know. Marco Polo.
And also oz's tie was silk.

759
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,990
Marco Polo was one of
the most well-known people

760
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,030
to travel the silk road.

761
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,350
That doesn't narrow it down.

762
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,496
- There's a million pools in Los Angeles.
- I know!

763
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,666
What about the notes? Maybe
there's some hidden wordplay in them.

764
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:32,940
Yeah, maybe.

765
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,590
All the fonts are different.

766
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,530
- What did you say?
- The fonts on each note,

767
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,700
they're all different.

768
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,220
Maybe that means something.

769
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,770
Yes! Yes, Daphne!

770
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,376
Okay, give me the
names of all of the fonts

771
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,090
in the order which we received the notes.

772
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,740
Okay. Romana, haptic script,

773
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,020
olicana, kiln sans and avant garde.

774
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,850
It's an acrostic.

775
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,106
It's a new word made by taking
the first letters of the other words.

776
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,510
R-h-o-k-a.

777
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,240
- Rhoka?
- Rhoka, yes!

778
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,380
<i>Before Ava was born,
her dad and I used to sneak</i>

779
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,550
into open houses for free
champagne and snacks.

780
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:06,110
One of them was designed by
an architect named j. R. Rhoka.

781
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,870
All right, Daphne, how many
houses can we find from this guy?

782
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,056
Looks like there's a few in Los Angeles.

783
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,420
How many have pools?

784
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,560
The house rhoka designed in encino.

785
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,700
- Just the one?
- Yes.

786
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,670
Encino. That's gotta be it. Go, go!

787
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:37,876
We gotta split up and find the pool.

788
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,520
We'll take the back.

789
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,900
Over here!

790
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,740
- Oz!
- I got him.

791
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,020
- Come on.
- Come on.

792
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,580
Come on.

793
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,270
Little bubbles means he's out of air.

794
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,480
- No.
- Come on.

795
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,940
Get him here.

796
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,150
Oz?

797
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,856
- He's not breathing. Come on, oz.
- Come on, come on. Come on, man.

798
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,470
One, two, three, four... oz.

799
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,880
- Come on, oz.
- Come on, come on.

800
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,890
- Come on, come on, man.
- Oz!

801
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,570
Come on. Lift him up. Lift him up.

802
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,126
- Get him up.
- Sit up. Sit up.

803
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,150
Okay. Okay.

804
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,080
- Good job.
- Okay.

805
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,580
How you feeling, oz?

806
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,540
Better than I look.

807
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,480
Always gotta be the center of attention?

808
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,000
Can't help myself.

809
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,520
Don't you dare scare us
like that again. You hear me?

810
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,860
I'll do my best, lieutenant.

811
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,940
Let's get CSI to comb
every inch of this house.

812
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,840
Stay here. You're riding with me.

813
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,010
Hey, Morgan.

814
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,816
Back when I was a
rookie, one of my first calls

815
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,360
was a possible drowning
in Laurel canyon.

816
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,230
Little girl, eight years old,
seconds away from not making it.

817
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,850
Just like me.

818
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,200
Well, all that matters is
that you did both make it.

819
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,890
Yeah.

820
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,520
You okay?

821
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:56,900
If...

822
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,730
If I can't get over
nearly losing a stranger...

823
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,056
How am I supposed to get over losing

824
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,250
one of the most
important people in my life?

825
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,430
Your dad?

826
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,230
I guess I... I got... I got some...

827
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,920
Some things to sort out.

828
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,510
Hey.

829
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,510
We all do.

830
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,186
- What do you want?
- I'm a friend of Morgan's.

831
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,630
Yeah, you're no friend of mine.

832
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:39,010
- I'm also LAPD.
- I know who you are.

833
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,310
Now get your hands off
the door before I slam it shut.

834
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,670
You asked her to meet
you here today alone. Why?

835
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,260
Answer my question.

836
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,060
Hey. Lower your voice, okay?

837
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,820
Daddy, what's wrong?

838
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,680
Hey, buddy.

839
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,410
Up then. Okay?

840
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,310
I'm just talking to my friend here.

841
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,480
- Hi.
- Hey.

842
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,730
Go on back to bed, okay?

843
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,210
When you get up, we'll
make some pancakes?

844
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,630
- Yeah.
- All right.

845
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,776
- Maybe we should go talk somewhere else.
- No, we're done talking.

846
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,250
Do you have any idea what I
went through to help that lady?

847
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,700
I asked her to come here

848
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,366
so I could give her
something, and that's it.

849
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,600
Okay?

850
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,856
Don't reach out to me again,

851
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,640
because I am not doing this anymore.

852
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,810
I already have a target on my back,

853
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,370
now I got one on my chest.

854
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:28,750
I don't need my kid visiting me
in a cage, or worse. Understand?

855
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,100
So tell me this, gio,

856
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,310
why did you offer to help
Morgan in the first place?

857
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,480
I got my reasons.

858
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,000
Okay. I can respect that.

859
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,750
You know, maybe on
some level, I misjudged you.

860
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,396
Last thing I want is for
anything bad to happen

861
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,700
to you or to your family.

862
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,266
But before I leave, I'm
gonna ask you one last time

863
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,360
to do the right thing.

864
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,220
For Morgan.

865
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,980
What else do you have on Roman?

866
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,330
Come on.

867
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,060
The house belongs to
Charles and Jacqueline peck,

868
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,680
who have been in their vacation home

869
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,260
in Cape Cod for the last two months.

870
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,240
But they have a son. David
Roy peck, 38 years old.

871
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,200
And David's twin sister Casey died

872
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,240
when they were ten years old.

873
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,146
<i>Now the pecks have been estranged
from their son since he was 18,</i>

874
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,420
<i>but that was the home that
David and Casey grew up in.</i>

875
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,360
Do we have a current
photo of David peck yet?

876
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:21,080
Nothing from the dmv, no known
work history, no social media,

877
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,296
- but we're working on it.
- When you get that photo,

878
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,560
I want it plastered on every
major news channel tonight.

879
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,670
Understood? All right.

880
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,130
Now, until this guy is in custody,

881
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,220
it is all hands on deck.

882
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,850
Let's get to work, people.

883
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:36,200
Do you guys know how many
family vacations we've been on?

884
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,720
Define "vacation."

885
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,060
Yeah. Does our trip
to west Covina count?

886
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,620
Our carburetor blew, and
we had to stay in a motel 6.

887
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,590
It had a pool. And free breakfast.

888
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,930
That's true. It did. But,
no, that doesn't count.

889
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,310
Well, then zero.

890
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,700
That's right. Zero. It's
all about to change.

891
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,280
- Really?
- Yes.

892
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,226
We're going on vacation. I
just don't know where yet.

893
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,250
Tahiti.

894
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,050
Whoa.

895
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,810
I do like the sun part of that.

896
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,870
Chloe's starting to
look a bit like a jellyfish.

897
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,500
Any chance we could add
the land of fire to the wish list?

898
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,570
- I don't even wanna know.
- Azerbaijan.

899
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,510
Ooh, but Liechtenstein
is a close second.

900
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,060
This escalated quickly.

901
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,610
Making a run for it.

902
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,550
- Terrible joke.
- It was pretty funny.

903
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,240
Early Thanksgiving?

904
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,410
Pot pies.

905
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,906
That was my favorite when I was a kid.

906
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,070
You guys are very lucky.

907
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,226
I'm heading in. I'll take this for you.

908
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,280
Thank you. Have a good day.

909
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,730
You too.

910
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,600
- That's it?
- What's it?

911
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,330
- Your flirt game is the worst.
- Get in the car.

912
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,810
You gotta work on that.

913
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:44,060
- Yeah. Tahiti.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

914
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,340
Hold on, we're not...
Okay. And she walked away.

915
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,966
She's lost her marbles.
We're not going to Tahiti.

916
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:51,430
You know what I was thinking?
Something like the Grand Canyon

917
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,760
or central Oregon.

918
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,720
Haven't done that.

919
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,320
I appreciate the gesture,

920
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,050
but Ava and I are too old for this game.

921
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,870
And Chloe's gonna
need a couple more years.

922
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,120
Found a photo of David Roy peck.

923
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,640
From a dui in Connecticut
from two years ago.

924
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,270
This is our guy?

925
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,340
Looks like the sketch was a little off.

926
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,930
- Maybe not.
- What do you mean?

927
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,570
I just spoke with the rehab facility

928
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,710
in upstate New York

929
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:48,446
where David Roy peck
has been in lockdown

930
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,570
for the past four months.

931
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,710
How is that possible?

932
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:52,570
Whoever is playing games with us,

933
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,650
it isn't David Roy peck.

934
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,650
Well, then who the hell is this guy?

935
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:13,770
Hello.

936
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,290
Morgan, I know where he is.

937
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,200
What are you talking about?

938
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:23,400
<i>Roman. He's alive.</i>
