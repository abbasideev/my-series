1
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,196
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

2
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:54,816
Yo, too damn sloppy on the heel
stand to hop, shuffle, ball change.

3
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,500
Here we go. A two, a
one, two, three, four.

4
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,450
What do you think? Too
much for my first day?

5
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,730
Not enough.

6
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,630
Yup. Always on the
same page. I like that.

7
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,570
Okay, what do you think?

8
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,516
You're pleased?

9
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,756
Great. As long as you are happy.

10
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,626
Let's do it. Yeah.

11
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,820
You're my best advocate...

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,256
- Am I in a dream?
- Chocolate chip pancakes.

13
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,736
Eggs à la Elliot.

14
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,366
- Which are what exactly?
- Scrambled eggs.

15
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,606
Sausage pucks.

16
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,576
Freshly brewed cup of coffee.

17
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,646
And a squeezed forever ago oj.

18
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,826
You guys, I don't even know
what to say. You're the best.

19
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,416
We wanted you to be ready
for your first official day doing...

20
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,230
What exactly are you doing?

21
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,416
Helping the cops solve cases.

22
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,640
Do you get your own squad car?

23
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,286
No, but I will be making enough money
that we can get our actual car back.

24
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,456
You know, speaking of more money,
we should talk iras at some point soon.

25
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,946
Simple, sep and roth.

26
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,736
Yeah. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

27
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,946
The point is this job, you
guys, if I don't quit or get fired,

28
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,800
is gonna help us out. In lots of ways.

29
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,980
Okay, gotta run. Thank
you so much again.

30
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,276
- Don't eat those.
- Wasn't planning on it.

31
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,276
Good morning. Dad!

32
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,036
You are just in time. And
good news, she's a barfer today.

33
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,456
Barfy baby. I got her.

34
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,526
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

35
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,526
Now that the LAPD
is paying me to Manny.

36
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,666
I love you!

37
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,310
- Bye, mom. Love you.
- Love you.

38
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,326
Samson, you busting
out the monk straps?

39
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,900
What the heck? Who's the lucky lady?

40
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,336
She's a florist. Loves chess, lives close.

41
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,816
You dog.

42
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,266
I better be invited to that wedding.

43
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,460
Let's hope.

44
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,866
Aren't you our cleaning lady?

45
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,960
Not today. Check back in with me
tomorrow after we see how this goes.

46
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,170
We're really doing this?

47
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,170
We're doing it.

48
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,226
Damien Ross. Fell
three stories onto his car.

49
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,290
911 got an anonymous call from
someone who heard the impact.

50
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,336
Emts rushed him to county general.

51
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,406
He's in surgery now,
not sure if he'll make it.

52
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,576
At first blush, I'm
thinking suicide attempt.

53
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,036
Strange as it may sound, Damien
was found wearing tap shoes,

54
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,826
so maybe he jumped
after one last dance.

55
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,710
"" What?

56
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,060
No, nothing. Just... I mean... you know.

57
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,720
No, I don't know.

58
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,736
Morgan, if this is gonna work,

59
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,876
and I can't believe
I'm actually saying this,

60
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,040
you have to say what you're thinking.

61
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,530
Okay. I think we need
to get up on that roof.

62
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,020
Okay. See how easy that was?

63
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,446
Okay, so... let it rip.

64
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,470
"Let it rip"?

65
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,796
I thought you were gonna hit me
with a bunch of obscure scientific

66
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,556
or historical details about
rooftops or something.

67
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,457
Okay, well, "lay it on
me" would work there.

68
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:09,550
Okay.

69
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,216
Was anything attached to this
when you guys first got here?

70
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,356
No, the techs haven't been up
here yet, so we're first to the scene.

71
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,526
Okay.

72
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,660
- Morgan.
- What?

73
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,690
Gloves, please.

74
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,116
Yes, gloves. How
could I forget the gloves?

75
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,086
So, if something were
attached to this tripod

76
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,120
and it got knocked over, it would be...

77
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,260
Looks like you found Damien's phone.

78
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,446
I don't know if this was Damien's.

79
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,316
So, you think someone
else was up here with him?

80
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,900
Well, I certainly don't think he
was up here dancing by himself.

81
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,806
Whoever's phone this is was left -
handed based on the smudge patterns.

82
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,380
We'll dust for prints.

83
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,930
I don't know who this little guy is.

84
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,426
De perros de Tijuana.

85
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,846
Mexican baseball team. They
won the title a few years back.

86
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,576
Hey, so you're good for the
obscure sports references.

87
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,606
Got it. What are you doing?

88
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,476
- Turning on the phone, Morgan.
- I can turn the phone on.

89
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
I'm sure you can.

90
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,560
It is possible that Damien was a
left-handed baseball fan, you know.

91
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,346
Michelangelo's 1487 painting,
the torment of Saint Anthony.

92
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,866
It's a glorious depiction
of the struggle suffered

93
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,480
by the patron Saint of lost things.

94
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,666
Well, maybe Damien was a catholic.

95
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,316
Until we know for
certain that this phone is

96
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,976
you know, karadec, normally I
drive a 1970 oldsmobile vista cruiser.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,666
It's in the shop right
now, but I love that car.

98
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,986
I love it so much it loves me.
We take good care of each other.

99
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,886
It's probably the healthiest
relationship I've ever had.

100
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,786
Damien loved his car.

101
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,436
He was obsessed with it.

102
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,646
If he was trying to take his own life,

103
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:45,546
I am not buying for a second that he would
take his beloved '81 cutlass with him.

104
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,446
And you may very well be right, Morgan,
but that's still just a theory. I need

105
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,146
evidence! You need your evidence.
You love your evidence. I'm learning that.

106
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,130
Have you ever seen tap dancing live?

107
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,016
It's captivating. Here's what I think:

108
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,630
Damien was up here
dancing under the stars,

109
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,016
fully immersed in the intoxicating
art of improvisation that is tap,

110
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,220
when someone pushed
him over the edge.

111
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,756
So I just checked in with CSI to see
if Damien had his cell phone on him

112
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,096
when he arrived at the hospital.

113
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
And?

114
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,446
He did. This phone
belongs to someone else.

115
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,516
So now we pray to Saint Anthony

116
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,230
that he helps us find whoever
pushed Damien off this roof.

117
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,526
Daphne, I need an update on Damien.

118
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,076
On hold, county general. Stand by.

119
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,186
Oz, talk to me.

120
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,526
Fast-tracking CSI
evidence from Damien's car.

121
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,846
Good. Karadec and Morgan are
in transit with the suspect's phone.

122
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,536
I want it processed within the hour.

123
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
Selena.

124
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,676
Lieutenant melon, to
what do I owe the pleasure?

125
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,196
You feeling generous today?

126
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,196
I need an extra pair of
hands in robbery-homicide.

127
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,376
Well, it's your lucky day because we're
just hanging around here in major crimes

128
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,926
with a whole lot of nothing to do.

129
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,406
This is serious.

130
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,066
Six jewelry stores hit
in the last two months.

131
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,486
I'm getting hammered in
the press, cap's all over me.

132
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,966
I'm even catching
heat from my girlfriend,

133
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,106
'cause she's too scared to go
shop for an engagement ring.

134
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,210
Aren't you supposed to
shop for the engagement ring?

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,350
I need to catch this guy before
someone gets hurt or killed.

136
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,420
You know I wouldn't ask if I
didn't really need the assist.

137
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,406
'Cause if there was a scuffle on the roof
we can assume our suspect's gonna have

138
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,056
have scratches. I get it.

139
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,190
Well, not just scratches. I
mean, based on this photo, look.

140
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,920
That's an ass pattern.

141
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,750
An ass pattern.

142
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,896
Yeah.

143
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,936
Listen, I've fallen a lot in my life,

144
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,656
and trust me, whoever made those
marks has lacerations all over the buns

145
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,116
and likely a bruised coccyx. Tailbone.

146
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,316
I know what a coccyx is.

147
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,456
- Daphne, what's the latest on Damien?
- Still on hold.

148
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,380
Hey, melon alert.

149
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,490
"Melon alert"?

150
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,636
All right, listen up. Teamwork
makes the dream work.

151
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,846
And right now, our friends
in robbery need our help.

152
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,296
Beggars can't be
choosers. I'll take anyone.

153
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,460
Except the cleaning lady.

154
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,336
You owe me one.

155
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,740
I'll ride with lieutenant melon.

156
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,206
Damien's out of surgery,
but on life support.

157
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,510
It could go either way.

158
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,796
All right, so starting right now,
we treat this as a murder case

159
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,650
because if this young man dies, it will be.

160
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,186
Daphne, pull all security footage
from surrounding buildings.

161
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,186
We need eyes on everyone
who was there that night.

162
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,156
You two go to the hospital.

163
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,660
See if this boy's family knows
anyone who might want him dead.

164
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,460
I'll be right there.

165
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
- Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
- Of course.

166
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,996
So, when I agreed to take this job

167
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,640
I promised to look into your missing ex.

168
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,896
S... Roman sinquerra.

169
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,626
Yeah. I'm assuming you might
need more than just his name.

170
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,356
You said he disappeared 15 years
ago. Can you tell me what happened?

171
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,356
Yes. He went out to buy diapers for Ava,
my oldest. She was just a baby back then.

172
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:58,350
He was driving a 1995 Mazda
rx - 7, California plates aahq729.

173
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,746
That's the last time I saw him.

174
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,336
Had you and Roman been

175
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,536
fighting? No. Listen, I
know what it sounds like,

176
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,530
like he went out for milk
and never came back.

177
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,020
It's a cliché for a reason.

178
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,300
That wasn't Roman.

179
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,160
All right. I'll see what I can find.

180
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,710
Thank you.

181
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,820
You know what the best part
of my day has been so far?

182
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,396
Am I gonna be flattered or offended?

183
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,016
Hopefully neither.

184
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,056
The best part of my day was
showing up to that crime scene

185
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,150
and not seeing a body on top of that car.

186
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,360
Pretty sure I don't have
to tell you why. But now...

187
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,080
Now we don't know
what we're walking into.

188
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,446
You know, in this line of work,
Morgan, you have to hope for the best

189
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,270
but be prepared for the worst.

190
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,966
It's your first day, so if you
wanna wait in the waiting room

191
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,456
I'm good.

192
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
Okay.

193
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,560
Ms. Ross.

194
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,506
Please, call me winnie.

195
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:18,096
Winnie, I'm detective
karadec. This is Morgan gillory.

196
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,950
She's assisting me on your son's case.
We are so sorry about what happened.

197
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,750
How's he doing?

198
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,250
The doctor said they don't
know if he'll survive the night.

199
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,286
And if he does, they don't
know if he'll walk again.

200
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,480
But growing up where he
did, he's beat the odds before.

201
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,086
He'll do it again.

202
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,296
I know this is a very difficult time, winnie.

203
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,466
We believe somebody pushed Damien
off that roof and, well, I have to ask

204
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,986
I know what you're gonna ask,
detective, and the answer is no.

205
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,716
There is nobody in this world
who would wanna hurt my boy.

206
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,090
You know, on the way over here,

207
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,950
I had the opportunity to watch your
son tap, and it took my breath away.

208
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,510
Your kid can really dance.

209
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,240
When Damien falls in love
with something, watch out.

210
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,766
Passionate and stubborn, that one.

211
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,410
I wonder who he gets that from.

212
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,520
Damien has made his share of
mistakes before he started working at bsb.

213
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,396
But they helped him get his life together.

214
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,506
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with bsb.

215
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,816
Body shop brothers.
It's a custom auto shop.

216
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,898
They hire at-risk youth
and ex - cons to fix

217
00:12:25,922 --> 00:12:27,910
up cars and get their lives back on track.

218
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,726
Damien is saving the money he's
making from working at the shop

219
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,750
for a plane ticket to New
York. He's Broadway bound.

220
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,596
If he can just p-pull through
this time, if he can just...

221
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,906
Beat the odds again, like you said.

222
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,110
Mama Ross?

223
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,630
Pardon me a moment.

224
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,330
I see two lefties.

225
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,570
And at least one catholic.
Not exactly a smoking gun.

226
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,726
- The phone was his.
- Whose?

227
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,106
The one who's got his
arm around Ms. Ross.

228
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,386
You see that elbow scar tattooed
over to look like baseball stitching?

229
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,690
That's from a Tommy John
injury. From a torn ulnar ligament.

230
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,350
And he was a pitcher.

231
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,420
For de perros de Tijuana.

232
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,320
Sorry to interrupt.

233
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,150
I'm detective karadec. Can
we talk? It'll just take a minute.

234
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,796
Damien. Quite the talent.

235
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,586
He's next-level, no
question. Good-looking too.

236
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,556
So, Roland, how
jealous of him were you?

237
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,550
Jealous enough to push him off a roof?

238
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,946
- I told you, I didn't push him.
- But you fought with him.

239
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,806
- That's when you dropped your phone.
- No!

240
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,700
Damien and I never fought.

241
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,840
Check his coccyx!

242
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,996
- Sounds like you have a suggestion?
- They gotta check his coccyx.

243
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,460
I know this looks really bad, but

244
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,470
we have reason to believe there's bruises
and lacerations on the suspect's backside.

245
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,976
We could get a warrant and make
you show us, or you could just tell us.

246
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,380
Make the right choice for us all, please.

247
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,660
You're right, we were up there last night.

248
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,296
But Damien, he's like a brother to me.

249
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,560
We met at the shop. When I told him I
used to dance, he offered to teach me.

250
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,336
He helped me get my life back together.

251
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,460
Then what happened on the roof?

252
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,190
Someone else pushed him.

253
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,896
Roland, do you actually
expect us to believe that?

254
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,316
I don't know where the
guy came from, okay?

255
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,826
He must have been
waiting there or something

256
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,690
because one minute we
were dancing and then...

257
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,116
He knocked me on my ass.

258
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,876
By the time I got up, Damien
was gone, him too, so I ran.

259
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,690
And let me guess, it was too
dark for you to see his face?

260
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,916
Without a witness who actually
saw Roland push Damien,

261
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,166
we barely have enough to hold him.

262
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,506
Daphne, what about eyes in the sky?

263
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:22,026
Well, security camera across the street
showed Damien's car pull in at 1:42 A.M.

264
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,650
- Any cameras in the alley?
- No. Got 'em everywhere else though.

265
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,756
It's an old office building.
No occupants since last year.

266
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,866
Maybe squatters took up
residence in the building

267
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,696
and didn't like noise
coming from upstairs.

268
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,006
We checked. They got
this place locked down tight.

269
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,006
No one going in or out in the last week.

270
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,350
So either our third guy teleported
in and out, or he doesn't exist.

271
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
He might.

272
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,910
What did you guys
do with Damien's car?

273
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,716
See I'm not the only one who
likes a little color on the nails.

274
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,606
What have we got here?
Mushroom mimosa?

275
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,406
- Biscotti body, but close.
- Ooh.

276
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,460
Boy.

277
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,921
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm not the
one who names nail polishes.

278
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,546
You've got three very patient officers
with you here in the impound garage

279
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,696
and I can tell you that at least one of
them would like to know the reason why.

280
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,556
Well, the reason why is
plasma chameleon paint.

281
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,186
See, plasma chameleon paint is
known for its color-changing properties

282
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:14,706
because the pigment makes the color change
depending on the angle and the lighting.

283
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,116
And that is why it is used
sometimes for nail polishes

284
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,776
and sometimes for custom
paint jobs for luxury cars.

285
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,056
Now, your lab... well, our lab found

286
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,476
our lab found traces of
paint in the trunk of the car,

287
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,406
which didn't surprise us
given that he does work

288
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,886
in an auto body shop that paints cars.

289
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,310
But Damien loved this baby so much,

290
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,616
there's no way he wasn't vacuuming
every square inch over the weekends.

291
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,066
That is correct.

292
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,456
And since there's not a trace of
that paint on the outside of the car,

293
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,936
and I highly doubt any of
those men hopped into the trunk

294
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,216
and painted his nails... Anybody?

295
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,426
You think whoever pushed Damien
off the roof worked at the body shop

296
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,000
and hid in the trunk of his car.

297
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,180
Yes, I do.

298
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,026
Roland was telling the truth.
There was a third man on the roof

299
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,646
and that man hitched a ride
to the scene of his own crime.

300
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,476
That would explain why we didn't
see anyone arriving on the scene.

301
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,446
The assailant got out of the car in
the alley and then followed them up.

302
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,236
It's a good theory, Morgan. The
only problem is that this is an '81 regal.

303
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,516
The trunk release safety feature
wasn't introduced until the mid-'80s,

304
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,136
which means if someone
did sneak in the trunk,

305
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,106
- they wouldn't have been able to get out.
- I thought about that too.

306
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,006
But what if one of Damien's coworkers

307
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,110
decided to give him a
little unwanted trunk job.

308
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,666
Sounded grosser than I wanted to.

309
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,086
Morgan, you are not helping.

310
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,970
- Close me in.
- I don't think that's a good idea...

311
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,290
That was aggressive.

312
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,716
This is getting weird now.

313
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,816
Okay, yeah. Give her a minute.

314
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,680
Yeah, there's no more
minutes for this, I'm...

315
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,726
Yep, found it. Little
rigged latch release thingy.

316
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,920
Turns out, trunk job it is.

317
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,276
Looks like you and Morgan have
to go see the body shop brothers.

318
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,750
Am I helping now?

319
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,846
Detective karadec.

320
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,056
Knox, right?

321
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,336
Chased you through
echo park a few years back.

322
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,376
What was it? Stolen
property? Identity theft?

323
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Both.

324
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,686
- What are you doing here, detective?
- Just doing my job.

325
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,206
Now we have reason to believe

326
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,306
that the person who tried to
kill Damien works here too.

327
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,330
Detective,

328
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,820
if you're insinuating what I think you're
insinuating, we don't appreciate that.

329
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,426
I'm not here to earn
your appreciation, Knox.

330
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,076
I'm here to find out
who tried to kill Damien.

331
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,216
Then go find him already.

332
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,000
I have an idea.

333
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,606
Hear me out. What if we did a trade?

334
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,366
Brought yourself a
random hot blonde, man?

335
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,056
I don't know about random.

336
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
She's a consultant.

337
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,786
Let me handle this, please.

338
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,196
What kind of trade?

339
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,196
You guys tell us where
you were last night,

340
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,740
and we get Damien's
car back to the shop asap.

341
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,756
It's at impound. That takes months.

342
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,990
What if it doesn't have to?

343
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
We're listening.

344
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,426
I bet detective karadec
here could call in a favor

345
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,116
and get Damien's car back
faster than he ran you down, Knox.

346
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,760
Which isn't really saying much, but.

347
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,566
- Morgan, I actually... I can't just...
- that way you guys will have time

348
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,196
to fix up his car and
get it all ready for him

349
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:14,917
when he wakes up and
comes home from the hospital.

350
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:16,120
I didn't know the guy,

351
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,180
but I'm getting the sense he would
do the exact same thing for you.

352
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,716
Damn right he would.

353
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,740
Excuse me.

354
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,786
Okay. Give me two
minutes with these guys.

355
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:26,850
For what?

356
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,626
Two minutes and I will get their alibies
right quick, right here on the spot.

357
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,106
You promise?

358
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,246
Can you go just make a phone
call to see if you can get the car?

359
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,890
Otherwise, we're not getting
anything out of them, you know that.

360
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,450
Two minutes.

361
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,730
Okay.

362
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,806
Getting the sense that
some of you are very angry

363
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,250
about what happened to your
friend. Or numb. Heartbroken.

364
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,266
All very reasonable
emotions to have right now,

365
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,266
but wouldn't you guys
feel a little bit better

366
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,490
if you could help us find
the guy who hurt your friend?

367
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,036
You guys gotta tell me
where you were last night.

368
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,416
'Cause if you don't tell me right now,

369
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,446
the cops are just gonna waste
time talking to other people,

370
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,270
like you, who did
absolutely nothing wrong.

371
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,750
Go ahead, man.

372
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah. I guess I'll go first.

373
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
Okay.

374
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,846
First up is Dane.

375
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:26,436
Dane was on his fifth and,
hopefully, final date with Lola last night.

376
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,820
The woman sounds like a nightmare.

377
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,956
I hope he makes a good
choice, but he's young and stupid.

378
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,856
Then we got big bear Knox.
Knox was in big bear with his dad.

379
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,966
They have a family cabin.

380
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,306
They go there pretty much
weekly to vamp it up a bit.

381
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,006
Fun perk of the job, I did
get an open invite to visit.

382
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,076
Not a perk of the job.

383
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,486
Not for you.

384
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,696
Then we got slappy. Tall
drink of water, handsome fella.

385
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,316
Tough nut to crack, but I tell you what...

386
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,396
Morgan. Is it safe to assume you
have this kind of info on all these guys?

387
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,046
Yeah. That was the job.

388
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,226
And where were you?

389
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,536
So, slappy was on a date with his

390
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Morgan, hold up.

391
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,126
But I'm in the middle
of painting a picture.

392
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,830
You guys keep interrupting, I have to say.

393
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,996
And I'm sure it's as
stunning as the sistine chapel,

394
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,580
but we really don't have time for this.

395
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,236
I'm sorry, you don't have time to give
these gentlemen the benefit of the doubt?

396
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,270
Did you all hear that?

397
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,486
Interesting. Is that because they have
a hard time with authority? Who doesn't?

398
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,246
Lots of people. Just download
Daphne with the details.

399
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,076
I'll make a case file to
share with a four-person team

400
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,666
that will track and trace the movements
of every suspect as part of our acp.

401
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,596
Acp?

402
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,086
Alibi confirmation protocol. Come on.

403
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,110
Great.

404
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,226
She's a lot more fun than you.

405
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,366
All right.

406
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,360
We got our work cut out for us.

407
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,026
I wanna find out which one

408
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,306
of these body shop bros is
our prime suspect by sunrise.

409
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,926
And since it turns out Roland was
telling the truth about the third person

410
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,260
I'll process his release.

411
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:52,240
Did you know that in 13th - century Sweden,
anyone could put a thief to death? Anyone.

412
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,356
Say I caught Ava
swiping my rubik's cube.

413
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,386
I could chop her head
off and it would just be like,

414
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,526
"hold on. Why is the head
rolling around the floor?"

415
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,736
"Don't know. I guess she
must've stolen something."

416
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,436
Ava, did you take Elliot's rubik's cube?

417
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,536
Yeah, mom. I lust after that rubik's cube.

418
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,746
When are we getting the car back?

419
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,746
I'm tired of leaving 45
minutes early to take the bus.

420
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,576
As soon as I can afford
to get it out of the shop.

421
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,376
You've been saying that forever.

422
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,610
I know I have, Ava.

423
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,970
And every single time I have to
say it again, it kills me a little more.

424
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,346
Ava got an a on her art project.

425
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,370
You did?

426
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,630
That's great. Why didn't
you tell me? Let me see it.

427
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,590
I think it shows some
real cubist influence.

428
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,296
Look. It's whiskers.

429
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,336
Buddy, that is really good.

430
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,360
It's okay.

431
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Follow me.

432
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,440
What are you showing me?

433
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,440
This.

434
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,420
What are they?

435
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,606
They're murals painted
all over Los Angeles.

436
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,840
Aren't they great?

437
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,226
Yeah, they're pretty cool.

438
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,190
Your father painted those.

439
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,136
Awesome. Thanks
for showing me these.

440
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,996
Hey. You've been upset that
you didn't inherit my talents,

441
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,346
but look, you got your dad's.

442
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,386
I got the talent of the guy
who walked out on us. Cool.

443
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,836
He did not walk out on us,
Ava, okay? I know it in my bones.

444
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,210
He just didn't do it. He loved us.

445
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:44,040
And now I've got the full
weight of the LAPD looking into it.

446
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,830
We're gonna get to the truth.

447
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,150
How about they work on
getting our car back instead?

448
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,466
So, what? Just because you
can't sleep, I don't get to either?

449
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,956
Do you remember
how Damien's mom said

450
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,406
no one in the world
would wanna hurt her son?

451
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,840
Sometimes even moms
get it wrong, Morgan.

452
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,616
Maybe this time we did. Let's dance.

453
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,160
- What are we doing?
- Come on.

454
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,510
Okay.

455
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,316
We thought the third man came
up onto the roof to kill Damien.

456
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,936
- And now you don't?
- Well, maybe.

457
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,906
But the best place for the killer to hide,

458
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:50,380
<i>where he wouldn't be seen by the dancers,
is over here behind this structure.</i>

459
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,776
So when Damien is close to the
edge, that is the killer's moment.

460
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,536
He's got to move without
hesitation. He bolts forward.

461
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,916
He knocks over the tripod,
the cell phone goes flying.

462
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,816
All of which we already know,
Morgan. So what are we missing?

463
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,500
We forgot to look up.

464
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,670
Are you familiar with
the opposition effect?

465
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,880
Remind me.

466
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,416
The opposition effect is an
astronomical phenomenon

467
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,516
during the first and last quarter
phases of the moon cycle.

468
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,936
That is when the moon is at
a 90-degree angle to the sun

469
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,556
and that's when it's at its brightest.

470
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,836
And that happened last night?

471
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:24,836
Not only that. Roland
called 911 at 2:14 A.M. right?

472
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,666
So let's say he needed ten, 15
minutes to get down off the roof,

473
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,946
get himself safe, pull himself
together and make a phone call.

474
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,986
Which would have placed the
time of impact shortly after 2:00.

475
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,460
Which places the moon right there.

476
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,306
So, what do you think the killer saw?

477
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,446
<i>Roland and Damien were in full shadow.</i>

478
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,540
<i>The moon was shining
right into the killer's eyes.</i>

479
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,090
<i>Moving fast under these conditions, he
couldn't see who it was he was pushing.</i>

480
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,106
Damien's mom was right.
No one wanted to kill her boy.

481
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,106
Our assailant pushed the wrong guy.

482
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,806
He meant to kill Roland.

483
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,666
We released him from
custody a few hours ago.

484
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,770
If someone still wants him
dead, they can try again.

485
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,976
We gotta find Roland
before the killer does.

486
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,040
Yeah.

487
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,156
- Hey, momma.
- Hey. Everybody's okay back there?

488
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,910
We're good. I already put Chloe to bed.

489
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,616
And our son's mandarin
is really coming along.

490
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,826
Though I guess I wouldn't know.

491
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,516
Yeah. Ava's okay?

492
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,346
She is still in her room.

493
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,586
<i>She came out for some ice cream.</i>

494
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,866
And acknowledged me with
a grunt, which is reassuring.

495
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,726
Daphne just texted me Roland's
number and home address.

496
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,386
Ludo, I gotta go. I'm gonna be
later than I thought. I'm so sorry.

497
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,356
- Yeah. Is everything okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

498
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,216
Don't worry about me,
okay? Thank you so much.

499
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,480
Mor... yeah, she's gone.

500
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,326
- Yeah?
- Roland, it's detective karadec.

501
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,336
- <i>Who?
- Can you turn the music down, please?</i>

502
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,600
- Not my call, bro.
- He's not at home.

503
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,546
It's detective karadec with the
LAPD, Roland. Where are you, buddy?

504
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,540
<i>We need you to get
someplace safe.-What?</i>

505
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,236
We believe you are in danger.

506
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,230
<i>Sorry, man. Can't hear you.</i>

507
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,030
<i>This is Roland. Leave a message.</i>

508
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,456
I'll have Daphne see if she
can locate him with a trace.

509
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,116
I think he's at gateway towers.

510
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,086
- What?
- It's a warehouse that hosts parties.

511
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,140
And you think he's there?

512
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,196
Yeah, I heard the song change
from flip fantasia to culture beat,

513
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,576
so I googled '90s remix party and
the only one that came up for tonight

514
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,400
- was at gateway towers.
- At gateway towers.

515
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,840
It's a little crime-fighting
tool called Google.

516
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,496
Might be a good time to call for backup.

517
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,386
They're on the way, but
we don't have time to wait.

518
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,156
Okay. When Roland left the precinct,
he was wearing a green hoodie,

519
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,280
black-and-white Adidas
superstars, and a red casio watch.

520
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,180
Let's hope he didn't change.

521
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,460
Hey! Hey! Where's Roland?

522
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,996
- I don't know.
- Is he here?

523
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,166
Hey, what's going on?

524
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,716
They're looking for Roland.

525
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,406
How many times can you
arrest a guy in one day?

526
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,570
We're trying to help the
young man. Where is he?

527
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,670
I don't know, man. He was
here. I hadn't seen him in a minute.

528
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,060
Please help us find him.

529
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,750
Okay.

530
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,970
I'm going this way.

531
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,490
Excuse me.

532
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,700
God. Feel like I'm on the bus.

533
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,980
Roland!

534
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,230
- Hey! Roland!
- No, I'm John.

535
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,270
Nice to meet you, John. Excuse me.

536
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,450
Yo, yo. He's over here.

537
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,450
Roland! Roland, come on, man.
We gotta get you outta here. You...

538
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,950
You know, Morgan, what happened
tonight is just part of the job.

539
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,366
It's the worst part of the job.

540
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,740
I wish I could tell you it
gets easier, but it does not.

541
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,546
We didn't get here fast enough,
not tonight, but next time, we will.

542
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,446
And when we do, I know we're
gonna have you to thank for it.

543
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,370
'Cause what you did on that
roof tonight, that was something.

544
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,046
I can't really take all the
credit for it. I had an assist.

545
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,386
Yeah?

546
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:01,076
Yeah, my daughter
Ava, her dad's a painter.

547
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,706
Was a painter. I don't
know if he still paints.

548
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,370
I haven't seen him in a long time, but...

549
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:10,846
He used to tell me that light was
the most important part of the job.

550
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,570
Hey, guys. Found something
you're gonna wanna see.

551
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,710
- Hey, if this is too much for you...
- no. I'm good. Let's find this guy.

552
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,756
All those people and nobody
noticed a man being shot?

553
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,556
Too loud. Plus all the lights.

554
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,100
The gunshot was just
one more flash in the dark.

555
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,890
<i>But if we look closer...</i>

556
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,736
Looks like Roland knew his killer.

557
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,046
And the killer knew everyone there
would have a phone on so he hid his face.

558
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,606
And this is all we got?

559
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,940
Yeah, for now.

560
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,086
Any update on Damien?

561
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,840
Last we called the hospital,
it was still touch and go.

562
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
You okay?

563
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,050
Yeah. Well, I'm just
gonna take a little walk.

564
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,200
There is nobody in this world
who would wanna hurt my boy.

565
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,906
<i>In this line of work, Morgan,
you have to hope for the best</i>

566
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,660
<i>but be prepared for the worst.</i>

567
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,640
Yes?

568
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,786
Do you have this on surveillance?

569
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,476
Yeah.

570
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,750
Play it. Excuse me. What are you doing?

571
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,920
Play the robbery.

572
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,966
Okay.

573
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,900
You take orders from her
now? This is highly inappropriate.

574
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,070
Hang on, hang on.

575
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,700
Stop. Right there.

576
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,156
You see those sparks
after the muzzle flash?

577
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,676
The color and the trajectory.
That is a very old gun.

578
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,336
Now you're ammunitions expert.

579
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,306
I'm not, but I took my
kids to pioneertown once,

580
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:02,470
<i>and the gunsmith went on and
on about guns in the wild west.</i>

581
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,856
- What's going on?
- Come here. Look at these sparks.

582
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,206
Okay, these sparks occur when
there is copper or lead left in the barrel.

583
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,866
Usually, a very old or
poorly maintained gun,

584
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,766
and they cause a flash
like the one in this robbery

585
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,890
and in the one that killed Roland.

586
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,736
So, great. Our robber
is at the o.K. Corral.

587
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,426
So you're saying you think that his
robber and our killer are the same guy?

588
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:25,180
I'm saying same gun.
What do you think?

589
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,226
I think you should give her
some time with your board.

590
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,870
You serious? My board?

591
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,230
- Coming through. Thanks.
- Excuse us.

592
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,400
Eyes up.

593
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,526
Lieutenant melon has
terrible handwriting.

594
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,916
The worst.

595
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,126
Hey, you really think
his robber is our killer?

596
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:03,196
I don't know. But I know
we gotta figure it out.

597
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,466
Okay, so where do we start?

598
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,080
We start with why.

599
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,020
Why would this guy
wanna murder Roland?

600
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,580
You believe this?

601
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,666
The cleaning lady's
rearranging my boards.

602
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,800
You see a cleaning lady. I see more.

603
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,056
Okay, sparkles. That's enough.

604
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,630
Morgan, what do you got?

605
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,786
I noticed something. We've
got five robberies, right?

606
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,026
The first three are here, here and here.

607
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,786
And at each site,

608
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:50,020
an eyewitness saw the robber
get into a different getaway car.

609
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,866
<i>A red Camaro, a blue
mini... An orange corvette.</i>

610
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,696
She gonna read my entire
case board back to me?

611
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,146
Now, at the fourth and fifth site, there
was no report of a getaway car at all.

612
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,836
So, it's possible the driver
could've parked farther away?

613
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,296
- Or something happened to the car.
- Or practice makes perfect.

614
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,466
They got faster and no one saw him go.

615
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,126
What do you think?

616
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,840
I think the robber lost his getaway car.

617
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:16,010
More importantly, I
think he lost his driver.

618
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,640
Now, see what these last two
jewelry stores have in common?

619
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,610
Okay, I'll give you a clue.

620
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:27,160
Now she's drawing on my map.

621
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:33,580
Really? Does no one take public transit?

622
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,016
Okay, well, guess who does. This
guy. So let me walk you through this.

623
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,366
This is the red line. Right here
are two stops along the red line.

624
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:47,986
These are two jewelry stores that
are within one block of those two stops.

625
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,026
You think the robber was on foot?

626
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,120
Yes, I do.

627
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,940
And I think the missing getaway driver,
someone who had access to multiple cars,

628
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,687
was Roland.

629
00:34:57,711 --> 00:35:00,246
Think about it. He worked at the shop.

630
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:03,386
<i>Any of the cars that stayed there
overnight, he would've had access to.</i>

631
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,906
And the robber started hitting
stores on foot a month ago.

632
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,176
Right. That was around the same time

633
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,116
that Damien helped
Roland escape a life of crime,

634
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,736
and they started posting
their dancing videos together.

635
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,186
That's right, so Roland
tells the robber, "I'm out."

636
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,916
But the robber can't trust
that Roland won't out him.

637
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:20,226
He knows that Damien and Roland
are dancing on rooftops all over la.

638
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,956
He decides to rig Damien's
trunk to push Roland off the roof.

639
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,366
But he pushes the wrong guy.

640
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,786
Now he's gotta find Roland at the club.

641
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,810
And to make sure he
does it right this time,

642
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,236
he brings his gun.

643
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,756
Look, this is great police work,
Morgan, but do you know who this guy is?

644
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,246
No, I don't.

645
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,930
But I do have an idea
about how we can find him.

646
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:49,466
<i>All units 6837, we have
a 187. Respond code 3.</i>

647
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:54,770
<i>Repeat, all units 6837, we
have a 187. Respond code 3.</i>

648
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,746
- Hands in the air! Nobody move!
- LAPD! Put your hands up!

649
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,910
- Drop your weapon!
- LAPD!

650
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,740
Put the gun on the ground
slowly. Lay down on the floor.

651
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,330
Belly on the floor now. Down.

652
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,230
Hands behind your back.

653
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,760
Let's go.

654
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,507
He looks confused.

655
00:36:27,531 --> 00:36:30,126
- Are you confused, griff?
- Lawyer.

656
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,630
You don't wanna talk. I
get it. You don't have to.

657
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,290
But I bet you're wondering
how we knew you'd be here.

658
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,926
- Can I tell him?
- Tell him.

659
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:42,756
See, I think you really were upset
about what happened to Damien.

660
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,516
<i>The red eyes, the tears, those were
real 'cause you didnt't mean to hurt him.</i>

661
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:51,170
But you see, mixed in with that
sadness, I saw something else: Guilt.

662
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,496
Side note, contrition
gonna be helpful for you

663
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,876
when you're talking to the parole board

664
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,116
after you're convicted
of murdering Roland.

665
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,986
So, how did we manage to
show up and spoil your party?

666
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:05,600
Well, joke's on you, it's our
party, bud, and we invited you.

667
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,856
Because we noticed that every
time you would Rob a jewelry store,

668
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,546
it would happen right after a code
3 went out on the police scanner.

669
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,476
<i>You figured the fewer units available,</i>

670
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,866
<i>the likelier chance you'd
have to be able to get away.</i>

671
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:21,076
But, luckily for the
residents of Los Angeles,

672
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,836
there's no actual code
3 happening tonight.

673
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,520
Just a 211, yours.

674
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,830
Let's go.

675
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,880
Heard a little rumor. Somebody just closed
their first official case with the LAPD.

676
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:43,530
So I did help.

677
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,996
You had your moments, which is
why soto asked me to give you this.

678
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,680
First official paycheck. Lands early.

679
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,960
No way.

680
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,327
Wow.

681
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:05,550
Karadec.

682
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,460
Yeah. Got it.

683
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,490
That was the hospital.

684
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,390
Damien's awake.

685
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,306
Please come on in.

686
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,990
- Hi.
- There's somebody I want you to meet.

687
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,370
These are the people I told you were
trying to figure out what happened.

688
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,060
Thank you.

689
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,340
- Damien moved his toes today.
- No way.

690
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:42,356
The doctors believe with some
work, he'll be dancing in no time.

691
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,490
That's right.

692
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,436
You know, because of you, I was able to
find out this guy's never seen a tap show.

693
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,266
What? You got something
against a good time?

694
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,630
No, no. I love a good time.

695
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,670
Then one day I'll get you
some tickets. Both of you.

696
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:57,920
Least I could do.

697
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,090
I heard about Roland and griff.

698
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,790
It's over now though. Don't worry.

699
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,280
Nah. I'm just getting started.

700
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,770
Now, what the hell
are y'all still doing here?

701
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,676
Get your ass, get back to
the shop and fix my car. Now.

702
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,986
- Okay.
- Gosh.

703
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:27,266
That's what I said, for the record.

704
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,786
- Yeah.
- Take care.

705
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,640
I need some wheels.

706
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,160
You know, that's not too
bad for your first case, gillory.

707
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,206
I'm just glad I was able to help.

708
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,456
Have you thought about quitting
while you're ahead, you know?

709
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,620
Kinda go out on top.

710
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,767
You do not want me to quit.
You're having way too much fun.

711
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:46,696
- I am?
- Yep.

712
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,216
Like driving you all over town.

713
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,560
No. No, that does have to stop.

714
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,470
No way!

715
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,710
I'm so sorry to just pop by, Morgan.

716
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,020
You're firing me in the
comfort of my own home?

717
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,780
That's a classy move. I respect that.

718
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,006
- You wanna come in?
- No, no, that's okay. I had some news.

719
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:54,526
You were on my way home.
I thought you'd wanna hear it.

720
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,790
- What is it?
- I followed up on Roman's car.

721
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,380
Turns out it ended up in police
impound three days after he disappeared.

722
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,706
It was abandoned in a costco parking lot

723
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,776
a couple of miles from
where you both lived.

724
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,430
In the short inventory of items
discovered in the car was a box of diapers,

725
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,330
which of course begs the question,

726
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,726
if Roman really wanted
to abandon your family,

727
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,820
why would he stop and buy diapers first?

728
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,930
You believe me.

729
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:31,100
We're gonna find out
what happened to Roman.

730
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,326
I promise.

731
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,520
Thank you.
