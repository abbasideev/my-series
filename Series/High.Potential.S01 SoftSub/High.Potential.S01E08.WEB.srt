1
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:04,314
Official LAPD business. Keep my
baby close. This won'’t take long.

2
00:00:05,764 --> 00:00:07,247
What exactly
are you doing?

3
00:00:07,248 --> 00:00:08,697
Helping the cops solve cases.

4
00:00:08,698 --> 00:00:10,492
- We'’re really doing this, huh?
- We'’re doing it.

5
00:00:10,493 --> 00:00:12,045
- You know this woman?
- I'’m his partner.

6
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:14,185
- We'’re not partners.
- Non-romantic partner.

7
00:00:14,186 --> 00:00:16,118
We'’re not partners.
She'’s actually
just a consultant.

8
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:18,914
We work on cases together
in a partnerly fashion.

9
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:20,260
Morgan did good work
on this case.

10
00:00:20,261 --> 00:00:21,779
Did you tell her that?

11
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,126
I obsess over
every little problem I see.

12
00:00:24,127 --> 00:00:26,542
My mind is constantly
spinning out of control.

13
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:30,132
Which makes it impossible
to hold a job, relationship.

14
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:32,065
I'’m Tom. Janitorial staff.

15
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,447
- Are you asking me
out on a date?
- I think I am.

16
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:35,827
When I agreed to take this job--

17
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,691
I promised to look into
your missing ex.

18
00:00:37,692 --> 00:00:38,968
Roman Sinquerra.

19
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,901
A month before he went missing,

20
00:00:40,902 --> 00:00:43,870
Roman was cited
for painting a mural
in an unauthorized location.

21
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:46,666
Back then, the area was a hotbed
for criminal activity.

22
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:48,840
- Roman wasn'’t a criminal.
- Well, then I'’m wondering

23
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,497
if he saw something
in the area he shouldn'’t have.

24
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:53,086
Honey, your father
loved you so much.

25
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:55,295
- That'’s why he left?
- It'’s more complicated
than that.

26
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,676
Whatever.
I don'’t even remember him.

27
00:00:56,677 --> 00:00:58,265
- If he could be here--
- I'’m glad he's not.

28
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,619
I know how early it is.

29
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:10,724
You want a spot for us
and our kids or not?

30
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:14,695
Will you just put on some shorts
and get down here?

31
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:24,429
Help!

32
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:42,446
So, I gotta be honest.
I haven'’t been on
many breakfast dates.

33
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:44,689
Mmm. Yeah.
Maybe '’cause they suck.

34
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,036
- Oh, that'’s great. Yep.
- You don'’t. You don't suck.

35
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:48,348
I'’m glad you're here.

36
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:50,523
I just feel bad that
this is all the time I have.

37
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:53,733
My life is kind of insane.
It'’s not ideal, I know.

38
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:57,046
Okay.
So, what'’s your ideal date?

39
00:01:57,047 --> 00:01:58,842
Oh. Um...

40
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,948
- Well, there'’d be
a cocktail involved.
- Great.

41
00:02:01,949 --> 00:02:04,433
And maybe just dinner
with an adult

42
00:02:04,434 --> 00:02:05,986
where I'’m not worried
about waking kids up.

43
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:07,265
Hey, I can be that adult.

44
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:10,784
Plus, didn'’t you say
your kids were away
with your ex this weekend?

45
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:13,684
They are, but I am on call
with the LAPD.

46
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:16,860
And every time I'’m on call,
they seem to call.

47
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:21,140
Okay, this is what
we'’re gonna do. Let'’s hope
that crime takes a holiday.

48
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,383
And I'’m gonna keep
Saturday night open for you.

49
00:02:23,384 --> 00:02:26,041
- No, you do not need to do that.
- It'’s too late. I just did it.

50
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:27,767
- Just canceled all my plans.
- Just now?

51
00:02:27,768 --> 00:02:30,079
Just now. Plus, I don'’t wanna
celebrate alone.

52
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,288
What are we celebrating?

53
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:33,738
You remember
that whole hostage situation?

54
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:36,189
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- I got shot. Yeah.

55
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,121
How'’s that going?

56
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:38,433
It'’s going good.

57
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:40,160
Just finished my rehab.
I'’m as good as new.

58
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:44,266
- And I'’m also
a pretty good cook.
- Really?

59
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:48,064
Yeah. I almost said great,
but I'’d rather under-promise
and over deliver.

60
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,552
Oh, look at that.
They'’re calling.

61
00:02:54,346 --> 00:02:55,691
Saturday night?

62
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:57,279
I have a good feeling about it.

63
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,558
- I like the optimism.
I really do.
- Mmm. Enjoy your day.

64
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:02,250
- You too.
- Go solve crime.

65
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:03,492
Thank you.

66
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,298
Am I good here?

67
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:17,576
You always park like this?

68
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:21,200
You wanna try
gliding this big boat
into a tiny spot, be my guest.

69
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,615
Seriously though,
am I gonna get a ticket?

70
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:24,410
- No.
- You know what you should do?

71
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:27,344
You should get me, like,
a universal parking pass.

72
00:03:27,345 --> 00:03:29,484
Like a citywide permit,
you know?

73
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:32,280
Something I can hang
from my rearview,
or a sticker would work.

74
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:33,626
Consider it done.

75
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:35,006
You'’re a terrible liar.

76
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,249
Thank you.

77
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,975
I'’ll start
walking it off right now.

78
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:39,149
Hey, Oz. What do we got?

79
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,220
Unidentified female. Late 20s.

80
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,980
- Blunt force trauma to the head.
-  Mmm.

81
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:44,878
Lifeguard was just showing up
for their shift.

82
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,364
Heard a woman yell for help
and ran over to perform CPR.

83
00:03:47,365 --> 00:03:49,366
She was alive at the time
but barely.

84
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:52,092
When the EMTs arrived,
they took over,
but she didn'’t make it.

85
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:55,337
Time of death
was called at 8:32 a.m.
About half an hour ago.

86
00:03:55,338 --> 00:03:56,649
We thinking accident
or foul play?

87
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,582
We started canvassing the area.

88
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,687
So far, no eyewitness account
of anyone matching
the woman'’s description

89
00:04:00,688 --> 00:04:03,243
have turned up
in the last couple of hours
at local businesses.

90
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,899
And I don'’t think
she was planning on swimming
in these clothes.

91
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,696
Plus, there'’s nothing
at the crime scene indicating
what caused that head wound.

92
00:04:09,697 --> 00:04:11,665
- Ah, so we'’re
looking at a murder.
- Maybe.

93
00:04:13,632 --> 00:04:15,254
- Give me your watch.
- Why?

94
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,186
- Just g-give...
- Okay.

95
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:19,949
- The paramedics
didn'’t detect a pulse?
- Right. That'’s why...

96
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:21,951
Wait. What are you...

97
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:26,748
Because there was
no detectable pulse at the time.

98
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:29,613
She'’s still alive.
Hey, get those EMTs
down here now!

99
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:31,131
How is that even possible?

100
00:04:31,132 --> 00:04:34,203
It'’s called the Lazarus effect.
You never heard of it?

101
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:36,067
Lazarus from the New Testament?

102
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,104
That'’s the guy.
He was raised from the dead.

103
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:40,796
And as a reward,
he has a medical anomaly
named after him.

104
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:44,524
It'’s the spontaneous return
of circulation after failed
attempts of resuscitation.

105
00:04:44,525 --> 00:04:46,043
So, it'’s like a miracle?

106
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:47,459
No, it'’s medical.

107
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,253
How'’s our Jane Doe?

108
00:04:49,254 --> 00:04:51,013
Hospital said
she had a skull fracture.

109
00:04:51,014 --> 00:04:53,084
She should be out of surgery
in a few hours if all goes well.

110
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:57,020
The moment she'’s up,
I want us there. See if
she can identify her assailant.

111
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:58,745
What about forensics?

112
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:00,885
Trace amounts of metal
found in the head wound.

113
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:03,267
I'’m thinking our weapon could be
a hammer or something.

114
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:07,236
Hey, guys,
I think I ID'’d our Jane Doe.
Heather Wallace. Twenty-seven.

115
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:10,032
Graduate student at UCLA,
according to her boyfriend,
Morris,

116
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:13,036
who filed a missing person'’s
report last night when she
didn'’t show up for dinner.

117
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:19,905
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

118
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,631
- Is that her?
- That'’s Heather.

119
00:05:22,632 --> 00:05:24,151
How long were you together?

120
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,602
Only a few months.

121
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,052
He'’s a little older
than Heather.

122
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:30,708
A little?

123
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:32,296
I was shopping at Abbot Kinney

124
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:35,265
when she asked me
for directions to the canals.

125
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:39,441
I walked her over there, and...
and we just clicked.

126
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:41,305
I'’m sorry,
can I get one of those?

127
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:44,929
Morris Jardine. Fifty-seven,
lives in the Palisades.

128
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,692
Founder of a leisurewear company
he sold last year.

129
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:49,727
Looks like he did quite well.

130
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:51,108
And where were you last night?

131
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:54,594
I was at home, picking out tile.

132
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:56,458
I'’m putting in a new pool.

133
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:01,152
I was frustrated.
So many choices.
Mosaic, glass, porcelain.

134
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:05,329
I wish that I was better
about not losing perspective.

135
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,470
I was in a bad mood
because of pool tiles.

136
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:10,852
I thought that was
so important, and now...

137
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:13,372
She'’s in the hospital
fighting for her life?

138
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,513
I wanna like this guy,
but I don'’t.

139
00:06:16,514 --> 00:06:19,308
I'’m with you.
Something feels off about him.

140
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:21,519
How about the fact that he
hasn'’t asked to see Heather yet?

141
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,624
- Lieutenant.
- You talked to UCLA?

142
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,317
Uh, yeah. But there'’s
no record of a student
named Heather Wallace.

143
00:06:28,318 --> 00:06:30,250
So, I ran
our victim'’s fingerprints

144
00:06:30,251 --> 00:06:33,254
and got a hit from when she
applied for a real estate
license two years ago.

145
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:35,532
"Penny Hall."

146
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:37,810
If Penny gave Morris
a fake name, then she definitely
had something to hide.

147
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:40,364
And maybe after he found out,
he attacked her on the beach.

148
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:43,712
I'’m no detective, but seems like
figuring out who our victim is

149
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:46,405
would help us figure out
who wanted to kill her.

150
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,027
Have an address?

151
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:50,650
We do. You and Karadec
go find out if Morris
is lying to us

152
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:52,929
and why Penny is lying to him.

153
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:58,901
Here we are, 11D.

154
00:07:02,698 --> 00:07:04,733
Penny'’s my favorite tenant.

155
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:06,010
Oh, yeah?

156
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:08,668
Yeah, I offered her
an upper unit when it opened up.

157
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:12,465
She wanted to stay after
what happened to her boyfriend.

158
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:13,880
What happened to her boyfriend?

159
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:15,711
Well, he died.
Murdered, I think.

160
00:07:18,748 --> 00:07:21,785
Morris Jardine, white guy, 50s?

161
00:07:21,786 --> 00:07:26,342
No, that doesn'’t sound right.
A young guy, about her age.

162
00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:29,862
His name was Marcus...
No, Lucas. Lucas Phillips.

163
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:31,726
Yeah, sweet guy.

164
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:35,869
Poor girl stayed in
for weeks after that.
I do hope she'’s all right.

165
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,353
Thank you.

166
00:07:39,044 --> 00:07:40,460
This must be Lucas.

167
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:48,121
Morris never mentioned
anything about Penny
having an ex who was killed.

168
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:49,502
But if she didn'’t trust him
with her real name,

169
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,022
she probably wasn'’t
telling him much.

170
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:56,095
Do you have any idea
how much this bag costs?

171
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:57,752
I have absolutely no idea.

172
00:07:57,753 --> 00:07:59,201
A lot.

173
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:01,480
You know,
I think Penny got scared
when her ex was killed.

174
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,758
Tried to stay off
the killer'’s radar
by using a fake name.

175
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,139
But whoever killed her ex
finally caught up with her.

176
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,347
Uh, these are
very expensive shoes

177
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:09,246
for a person who lives
in a crappy part of town.

178
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:12,076
Well, then. Maybe we have
a sugar daddy situation
gone wrong.

179
00:08:12,077 --> 00:08:14,562
Not with those credit card bills
on her counter.

180
00:08:14,563 --> 00:08:16,219
This doesn'’t make any sense.

181
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:23,986
You'’re right. Morris wasn't
paying for the clothes
or the bags. She was.

182
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:27,575
Well, that'’s strange.

183
00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:30,992
Penny is paying 2,500 bucks
a month for a billboard on PCH.

184
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:32,131
Billboard for what?

185
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:33,685
We'’ll certainly find out.

186
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,756
You'’re right. This is weird.

187
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:38,827
Penny lives here, except for
any one of her outfits

188
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:41,002
would pay my mortgage
for an entire month.

189
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:42,901
That'’s not to mention
the handbags or the shoes.

190
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:46,490
Why does a woman
hide her identity,

191
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:49,805
date a rich guy
while going into serious debt
trying to keep up appearances?

192
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:07,581
Could have something to do
with that.

193
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:20,317
So, our victim was investigating
another victim?

194
00:09:20,318 --> 00:09:23,251
It was a cold case. And Penny
was pulling out all the stops.

195
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:24,149
Oz, do the honors.

196
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:28,118
She did this?

197
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:29,602
It'’s Lucas Phillips,
Penny'’s boyfriend,

198
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,673
found dead two years ago
just after the Fourth of July.

199
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:33,192
Detective Clark Boding
worked the case.

200
00:09:33,193 --> 00:09:36,229
Yes, I remember. He was
really upset about that one.

201
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,921
Remained unsolved
when he retired.

202
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:41,027
Now, the police reports
suspected Lucas
was robbed on the beach.

203
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:43,823
Poor guy died
from blunt force trauma
just after 10:00 p.m.

204
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:46,446
- Just like Penny Hall.
- But we know Penny
wasn'’t robbed.

205
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:48,690
Otherwise, that diamond necklace
would'’ve been long gone.

206
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:51,831
Exactly. I don'’t think
the motive for Lucas'’s murder
was robbery either.

207
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:53,730
The killer just wanted us
to believe that.

208
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:55,802
So, it'’s looking like Lucas
and Penny were attacked by
the same person.

209
00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:57,700
What'’s with the rice?

210
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:02,221
Tiny pieces of rice
found on Lucas'’s hair.

211
00:10:02,222 --> 00:10:03,775
No one found
an explanation for it.

212
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:06,294
Yeah. Nor for the antifreeze
in his nose.

213
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:10,437
Yeah. No, I saw that,
but rice? How does somebody
get rice in their hair?

214
00:10:11,852 --> 00:10:14,164
I mean, where was this guy?
At a wedding?

215
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:16,546
I doubt that milling rice
was his idea of a good time.

216
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,515
- Just saying. Make a note.
- Noted. What else we got?

217
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:22,034
For the two years
prior to his death,

218
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:25,071
Lucas worked as a tennis coach
at the Marina Azul Beach Club.

219
00:10:25,072 --> 00:10:28,523
So, do we think Lucas'’s killer
is part of the beach club set?

220
00:10:28,524 --> 00:10:31,491
Uh, Detective Boding interviewed
at least a dozen people
from the club.

221
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:33,977
According to his investigation,
their alibis check out.

222
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:35,668
Well, Penny didn'’t think so.

223
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:38,360
There are
club members all over her board.

224
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:40,155
And her receipts show
she went there a lot.

225
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:41,813
If you can'’t afford a membership
to the club...

226
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:43,883
Date a member.

227
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:47,404
Morris. So, we know Penny
came up with an identity,

228
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:50,614
bought clothes to blend in,
then started going with Morris

229
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:52,927
to do her own investigation
into the death of her boyfriend.

230
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:55,101
Which probably means
either Morris found out

231
00:10:55,102 --> 00:10:57,414
and filed
a missing person'’s report
on his own victim...

232
00:10:57,415 --> 00:11:00,763
Or whoever killed Lucas
wanted to silence Penny '’cause
she was getting too close.

233
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:02,731
Go find out which.

234
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:15,121
Okay, but why would you think
that they wouldn'’t let you in?

235
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:18,124
I'’ve worked
in these kinds of places,
and we didn'’t let me in.

236
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,023
Huh.

237
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:21,887
Uh, there'’s Morris.

238
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:24,028
Looks like he belongs
on the campaign trail.

239
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:26,202
Tracks for a place like this.

240
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:28,583
Can I help you with something?

241
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:30,689
Yes, we'’re investigating
a crime in the area.
Who'’s in charge here?

242
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,313
That would be Mr. Wilson.
But I'’m afraid I can't
let you past the main foyer.

243
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,248
Yeah, you guys have
a strict dress code?

244
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:39,974
I'’m sorry, but yes, we do.

245
00:11:39,975 --> 00:11:41,561
- And I'’m not passing it?
- I'’m afraid so.

246
00:11:41,562 --> 00:11:45,186
Club rules state no denim,
no shorts and no graphic tees,

247
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:46,705
but we can offer you a blazer.

248
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,984
- Oh. A blazer. Do you hear that?
- Yeah.

249
00:11:49,985 --> 00:11:52,814
Hang on though. What about
my car and my bank account

250
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:55,472
and my kids in...
in public school?

251
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:59,408
I guess what I'’m asking is
how much does this blazer
actually cover?

252
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:01,686
Like, is it a magic blazer?

253
00:12:04,585 --> 00:12:08,727
My grandfather founded
the Marina Azul Beach Club
in 1974.

254
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,694
He bought 20 acres
of beachfront property

255
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:12,421
for less than I paid
for a year at grad school.

256
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:16,148
- It'’s very nice.
- Yeah, our members
seem to think so.

257
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:18,944
Oceanfront dining,
poolside café,
ten tennis courts.

258
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:20,809
We'’re not here for the tour,
Mr. Wilson.

259
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:24,190
Did you hear about
the young woman that was found
a mile down shore?

260
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,091
No, no. We have a private beach,
so we don'’t really mingle
with the public.

261
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:29,231
Different crowd.

262
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:30,611
Edward.

263
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:33,717
Yo. Ross wanted
to switch the cab
with his favorite merlot,

264
00:12:33,718 --> 00:12:35,236
but I thought we agreed
the '’95 was garbage.

265
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:36,651
I'’m with the guests, Blaine.

266
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:38,929
This is Blaine, our head of
guest services here at the club.

267
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:43,417
I'’m also his brother,
which Eddie likes to,
uh, leave out.

268
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:46,662
Are you... You a new member?

269
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,872
Nope. You recognize her?

270
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:54,807
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.
Uh, what'’s her name?

271
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:56,429
She'’s...
She'’s with Morris, right?

272
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,226
Yes. Have you seen her talk
to anyone recently?

273
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,815
Sorry, guys, I meet a lot of
members'’ girlfriends,

274
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,886
but I don'’t really keep track
until one'’s wearing a rock

275
00:13:04,887 --> 00:13:06,405
and they wanna rent the place
for a wedding.

276
00:13:06,406 --> 00:13:07,717
You guys must remember this one.

277
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:14,068
- Oh, they do.
- Yeah, that'’s, uh, Lucas.

278
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:16,139
He was a tennis instructor here.
He was very popular.

279
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,797
It'’s a real shame.

280
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:19,971
Anything else?

281
00:13:20,661 --> 00:13:22,904
Not really. It'’s been
a couple of years, man.

282
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:23,803
Hmm.

283
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,907
You know what?
I'’m gonna give you my card.

284
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:27,460
You give me a call
if you remember anything.

285
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:30,084
I tell you what,
if I think of anything else,

286
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:31,224
I'’ll just call 911.

287
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:40,957
Of course they'’re brothers.
Very handsome. Very smug.

288
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,028
Very unhelpful.

289
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:44,996
I'’m gonna try to get a warrant
so we can take a look
at their personal profiles.

290
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:49,241
Yes. Thank you. I can take that.

291
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:51,037
- Yeah. Burn it.
- Ah.

292
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:56,594
- How'’d you get that black eye?
- Oh, I'’m fine. Thank you.

293
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:00,805
- Did a member do that?
-  No.
It wasn'’t one of ours.

294
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:04,256
Yesterday, a gentleman
on the beach was trying
to sell some illegal goods.

295
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:06,604
Got him off the property,
he landed one on me.

296
00:14:07,674 --> 00:14:09,193
Did you get
this gentleman'’s name?

297
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:13,334
Cameron Smith, aka Swizz.

298
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:16,889
Two priors for assault,
one for possession,
one for public nudity.

299
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,374
Club attendant
says he'’s out here
at the same time every day.

300
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,791
And if he was kicked out
of the club an hour before
Penny was attacked,

301
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:24,552
then he must'’ve been
in the area.

302
00:14:24,553 --> 00:14:26,692
But what does he have to do
with what happened
to Lucas and Penny?

303
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:28,142
Maybe nothing,
but if Lucas was killed

304
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:30,006
because of something
that happened in the club,

305
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:32,492
and this guy was
selling drugs to its members,
he had to know something.

306
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:35,184
- Here'’s our guy.
- You sure?

307
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:37,531
Pretty sure.

308
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:41,224
You comfortable over there?

309
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:43,020
Matter of fact, I am.

310
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:45,022
Help yourself.

311
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:49,888
So, why y'’all being
so nice to me?

312
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,407
Are people not normally
nice to you?

313
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:56,102
In general, no. But maybe I
haven'’t done myself any favors.

314
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,069
Shouldn'’t have to.
People should still be nice.

315
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,622
Did you know Lucas Phillips?

316
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:02,591
Found dead on the beach
a couple years ago?

317
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:04,938
How about this?

318
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:06,974
What about her?

319
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:09,045
His girlfriend at the time.
You know her, right?

320
00:15:09,046 --> 00:15:12,841
She'’s clinging to life
after being hit in the head
and dumped on the beach.

321
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:15,742
She barely had a pulse
when we found her.
Did you see her last night?

322
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:18,019
There'’s a detective
out in that bullpen

323
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,883
doing a track and trace
on your phone right now,

324
00:15:19,884 --> 00:15:21,195
so you might as well
just tell us the truth.

325
00:15:21,196 --> 00:15:23,060
Especially if you didn'’t do
anything wrong.

326
00:15:23,577 --> 00:15:26,994
Besides assaulting a valet guy,
which I could arrest you for
right now.

327
00:15:26,995 --> 00:15:28,237
Have you seen her recently?

328
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:31,757
- Yeah, I saw her.
- And?

329
00:15:31,758 --> 00:15:34,311
And all I did was tell her
to stop coming around

330
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:36,487
acting like I'’m the one
that killed Lucas.

331
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,834
I don'’t like
being accused of things
that I didn'’t do.

332
00:15:39,835 --> 00:15:41,250
That girl wouldn'’t let up.

333
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,356
At about what time was that?

334
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,118
I don'’t know.
Like, 9:00 o'’clock. Just before
I went to the beach club.

335
00:15:47,705 --> 00:15:49,568
I know it looks bad, okay?

336
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:52,053
But I wasn'’t selling drugs
on their beach.

337
00:15:52,054 --> 00:15:54,193
I was just trying to get
in the club to see Blaine.

338
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:55,850
He'’s been dodging me for weeks.

339
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:57,334
Why is Blaine dodging you?

340
00:15:57,335 --> 00:15:58,854
'’Cause he still owes me money.

341
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,859
I'’m sorry,
Blaine owes you money?

342
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,723
See? That'’s the problem
right there.

343
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:10,727
You folks spend all your time
judging guys like me,

344
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:13,869
but never shine the light on
all those privileged-ass people.

345
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:15,491
Maybe we will.

346
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:18,011
But first we'’re gonna
go talk to Penny.

347
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,186
Because she just woke up.

348
00:16:31,887 --> 00:16:33,646
Penny, hi.

349
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:36,995
I'’m Detective Karadec.
This is Morgan,
she'’s assisting me on your case.

350
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,998
Hi. Glad you'’re back.

351
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,137
It'’s good to be back.

352
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:43,036
Yeah, she'’s feeling much better.

353
00:16:43,657 --> 00:16:46,038
Uh, Morris, would you mind
giving us a minute?

354
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,144
Of course.

355
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:54,392
I can'’t believe he's still here.

356
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:58,499
He didn'’t even know
my real name until yesterday.

357
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,983
Hmm.

358
00:16:59,984 --> 00:17:01,882
Penny, tell us everything
you remember about last night.

359
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,851
I was responding
to one of the calls.

360
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:07,922
- From your billboard?
- Yes.

361
00:17:07,923 --> 00:17:09,683
But this one seemed legit. It...

362
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:13,377
They said they saw
the attack on Lucas.

363
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:17,449
So, I went to meet them
at the beach.

364
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,934
And then what happened?

365
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,559
I... I felt something
hit me from behind.

366
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,046
The next thing I remember
is waking up in the water.

367
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:29,979
I didn'’t even see their face.

368
00:17:32,672 --> 00:17:34,638
I just want all this to be over.

369
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:36,813
Well, the good news is
that'’s why we're here.

370
00:17:36,814 --> 00:17:40,093
Thank you. But I should'’ve
never gone this far.

371
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:43,993
But I had to know
who killed Lucas.

372
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,928
Yeah. It sounds like he was
a pretty special guy.

373
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,795
One of a kind.

374
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,557
That'’s a really
beautiful necklace.

375
00:17:57,938 --> 00:17:59,733
He gave it to me
the week that he died.

376
00:18:02,426 --> 00:18:07,086
Um, Penny, we may
have to reopen Lucas'’s case
to find out who did this to you.

377
00:18:07,914 --> 00:18:11,090
Was there anything about
the days leading up to his death
that stuck out to you?

378
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:15,023
I'’ve gone over it
a million times in my head,

379
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:17,441
but I could never find
anything concrete.

380
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,512
What about the beach club?
We spent a little time there.

381
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:22,066
Can you tell us
anything about that?

382
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,724
Lucas loved it.

383
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:26,967
The job, the people.

384
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:29,625
I thought
the whole idea of it was weird.

385
00:18:30,385 --> 00:18:31,868
What do you know about Blaine?

386
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:33,974
We saw that you had
a picture of him in your closet.

387
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:37,563
Lucas and Blaine
had some nasty run-ins.

388
00:18:37,564 --> 00:18:40,497
One was so bad,
Blaine suspended Lucas.

389
00:18:40,498 --> 00:18:42,604
Said if there was
another problem, he'’d fire him.

390
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:47,746
I tried to get to him,
but it was hard,

391
00:18:47,747 --> 00:18:49,783
because he is well-protected
by his brother.

392
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:54,960
Well, I think that
about does it for us.

393
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:57,135
Penny, we'’ll make sure
we leave one of our officers
here with you

394
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,930
- while we keep investigating.
- You rest. Continue to heal.

395
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,830
We'’re gonna go find out
who did this.

396
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:04,798
I hope you'’re right.

397
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:09,665
I know my brother.
He wouldn'’t hurt anybody.

398
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:12,184
You sure about that?

399
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,082
Because everyone
we talked to says
he just plays by his own rules.

400
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,498
Blaine'’s not perfect,

401
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:18,466
but I know he can explain
all this when he gets back.

402
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:21,470
- And when might that be?
- I don'’t know exactly.

403
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,301
Can I ask you
a serious question?

404
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:27,993
Did you rob
an airport gift shop?

405
00:19:27,994 --> 00:19:30,271
What? No.

406
00:19:30,272 --> 00:19:33,172
Each year, Blaine and I pick
a different country to visit.

407
00:19:33,827 --> 00:19:37,003
We'’ve been doing it
since we first traveled
the Mediterranean as kids.

408
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:39,453
You gonna arrest me for that?

409
00:19:39,454 --> 00:19:41,317
Well, if your brother
murdered one person
and tried to kill another,

410
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:43,595
and you'’ve been protecting him,
I will absolutely arrest you.

411
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:45,942
I would do anything
for my brother, and I have,

412
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:47,875
but we'’re talking about
murder here.

413
00:19:47,876 --> 00:19:50,153
Getting him through rehab,
that'’s one thing, okay?

414
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:51,775
Covering up
his money troubles, sure.

415
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:53,468
But what you'’re suggesting,
it'’s insane.

416
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:58,023
And Blaine,
I'’ve been there to help him
through the lowest of lows,

417
00:19:58,024 --> 00:19:59,438
and now he'’s through the fog.

418
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,854
So, I really don'’t
appreciate you standing there

419
00:20:01,855 --> 00:20:04,236
and accusing him of something
I know he didn'’t do.

420
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:07,206
I can appreciate that, but we
still need to talk to him.

421
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,519
He was checking in with
his sponsor a few hours ago.
Feel free to come back.

422
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,763
Oh, we'’ll be back.

423
00:20:14,868 --> 00:20:16,835
I think Morris is out.

424
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:18,181
Blaine is clearly dodging us.

425
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:19,804
A meeting with a sponsor
shouldn'’t take this long.

426
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:22,462
Yep, I agree.

427
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:28,260
But I might have someone
just as interesting
for us to talk to.

428
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:29,504
Who?

429
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:31,230
Her.

430
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,339
Oh, I love your necklace.

431
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,239
Oh. Thank you.

432
00:20:40,722 --> 00:20:42,516
My husband
had it custom-made for me

433
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:44,449
to celebrate
our tenth wedding anniversary.

434
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,245
Oh. Do you wanna guess
how many diamonds?

435
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,729
You go ahead.

436
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,836
I'’m guessing 120 diamonds
for 120 months of marriage.

437
00:20:52,837 --> 00:20:54,908
That'’s right.

438
00:20:55,806 --> 00:20:58,497
One of a kind, he said.
Just like me.

439
00:20:58,498 --> 00:20:59,912
Corny, I know.

440
00:20:59,913 --> 00:21:02,122
I mean, I guess it'’s not corny
if you mean it.

441
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,608
- Did you say
it was one of a kind, though?
- Yeah, because we just saw one

442
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:07,713
that looked exactly like that.

443
00:21:07,714 --> 00:21:11,304
We did. We did, right? Except
that one was real diamonds.
This one'’s moissanite.

444
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,168
Sorry, I'’m not familiar.

445
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:15,550
Oh, you'’re about to be.

446
00:21:16,136 --> 00:21:17,621
Yeah, sodium carbide.

447
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:22,970
It was discovered by
French scientist Henri Moissan
in a meteor crater in 1893.

448
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:25,352
Nowadays, they'’re lab-grown,

449
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:28,182
but that makes them
a great alternative
to mined diamonds,

450
00:21:28,183 --> 00:21:29,701
and you can barely tell
the difference.

451
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:31,392
They'’re more ethical,
better on the environment,

452
00:21:31,393 --> 00:21:33,152
certainly more economical,

453
00:21:33,153 --> 00:21:36,881
and their
double refractory properties
makes them throw rainbows

454
00:21:37,951 --> 00:21:39,712
whereas diamonds throw white.

455
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:44,094
Who are you guys?

456
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:48,272
The ones investigating
the attack on this young woman.
You recognize her?

457
00:21:49,756 --> 00:21:51,551
I'’m sorry,
I don'’t know who that is.

458
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:53,967
What about her boyfriend, Lucas?

459
00:22:01,665 --> 00:22:03,907
I gave the real one to Lucas.

460
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:05,358
Why would you give it to him?

461
00:22:06,946 --> 00:22:09,397
Should we just ask
your husband about it?

462
00:22:11,468 --> 00:22:13,331
Shelby Havertz
was having an affair

463
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,092
with the club'’s head of
guest services, Blaine Wilson.

464
00:22:16,093 --> 00:22:17,369
And Shelby'’s
not just any member.

465
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,957
Her husband
is on the city council,

466
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,822
which means if he found out,
club'’s liquor license goes away.

467
00:22:21,823 --> 00:22:23,686
Lucas found out about
Shelby and Blaine.

468
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:26,205
Shelby didn'’t want
her husband to ruin
her boyfriend'’s business.

469
00:22:26,206 --> 00:22:28,276
Yeah, so Shelby gave Lucas
her expensive necklace

470
00:22:28,277 --> 00:22:30,175
to keep him quiet,
and bought herself
a cheaper replica.

471
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:32,833
And then Lucas
gave the real diamond necklace
to Penny.

472
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:36,112
Now, Blaine didn'’t think Lucas
would keep quiet. That'’s motive.

473
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:37,872
Where'’s Blaine now?

474
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:40,359
We'’re waiting on confirmation,
but supposedly with his sponsor.

475
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:43,637
Uh, is this about the rice?

476
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:45,364
No, it'’s about his shorts. Look.

477
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:47,848
His shorts are wet,
but his hair'’s dry.

478
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:49,436
But if he was killed
at 10:00 p.m.,

479
00:22:49,437 --> 00:22:50,920
wouldn'’t his body be
on the beach all night long?

480
00:22:50,921 --> 00:22:52,370
- Yes.
-  Well, okay.

481
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,510
The problem is,
high tide happens
around here twice a day.

482
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:57,409
Once in the afternoon,
once between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m.

483
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,929
So when they found his body
on the beach in the morning--

484
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,483
He should'’ve been
totally soaked from the tide,
but he wasn'’t.

485
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:03,967
Either we have
the wrong time of death...

486
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:05,867
Or Lucas didn'’t die
on the beach.

487
00:23:09,664 --> 00:23:11,079
I think Lucas
was killed somewhere else.

488
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:15,290
For all we know,
he could'’ve been stuffed
inside a suitcase.

489
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,398
Probably by somebody who waited
until the beach would be empty.

490
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:23,609
His body was placed there
by the killer
sometime after high tide.

491
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,646
Which means we have to find
the actual crime scene.

492
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:35,861
Daphne, where we at with
the Lucas Phillips cold case?

493
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:39,451
Sending all CCTV
for Carbon Beach
and surrounding areas

494
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:41,660
on the day of Lucas'’s murder
back to the team for review.

495
00:23:41,661 --> 00:23:43,455
And everyone'’s clear on
what we'’re looking for?

496
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:45,493
Anyone moving a bag
that could have a body inside.

497
00:23:46,183 --> 00:23:47,873
Detective, I need you and Lyons
to double-check

498
00:23:47,874 --> 00:23:49,461
the alibis of everybody
on this board, please.

499
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:51,014
On it.

500
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:53,742
I don'’t care if they want
a statement. The answer is no.

501
00:23:54,536 --> 00:23:56,157
Talk to me.

502
00:23:56,158 --> 00:23:58,021
Well, now that we'’re looking for
a completely different
crime scene,

503
00:23:58,022 --> 00:24:00,472
I think we should circle back
to a few of these people
one more time.

504
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:02,854
-  Which ones?
- It'’s too soon to tell,
but we'’ll zero in.

505
00:24:02,855 --> 00:24:04,718
Oz is going back over
all the forensics now.

506
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:09,032
Only 15% of cold cases
get solved. Less than ten
after two years.

507
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:10,931
Yeah, we have our work cut out
for us, Morgan.

508
00:24:10,932 --> 00:24:12,380
That'’s why
we'’re digging in, right?

509
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:15,142
I know. I just wish I could see
what I'’m missing.

510
00:24:15,143 --> 00:24:16,488
Don'’t be so hard on yourself.

511
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:18,525
You just figured out
Lucas'’s body was moved.

512
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:20,458
And if we find
where he was actually killed,

513
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,183
- it could lead us to--
- To who actually did it.

514
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:24,151
Yes, I understand that.

515
00:24:24,152 --> 00:24:27,050
But are we really
spinning our wheels looking for
a two-year-old crime scene?

516
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:29,950
And Daphne'’s gonna spend
the next 18 hours doing what?

517
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:32,090
Looking for a car
that drove near the beach

518
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:35,196
that maybe had a dead body in it
that we wouldn'’t be able
to see anyway?

519
00:24:35,197 --> 00:24:37,889
Morgan, it'’s time well spent
if it gets us somewhere.

520
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,856
Even if it takes days or weeks--

521
00:24:39,857 --> 00:24:42,653
Or months, or even years.
Yeah, I'’m well aware.

522
00:24:44,862 --> 00:24:47,520
Yeah, that'’s what we do.
Review evidence with fresh eyes.

523
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:51,143
I will eat and sleep here
if it means finding something
on Lucas'’s body

524
00:24:51,144 --> 00:24:52,559
that came from
the real crime scene.

525
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,353
That sends us to a new location.

526
00:24:54,354 --> 00:24:57,081
A new location sends us back
to one of those suspects
on the board.

527
00:24:57,979 --> 00:25:00,290
I mean, we weren'’t looking at it
through the right lens before.

528
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,500
We are now,

529
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,329
because of you.

530
00:25:04,848 --> 00:25:06,643
Is this
your first bullpen speech?

531
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,816
Out loud, yeah.

532
00:25:08,817 --> 00:25:10,405
Very inspiring.

533
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,097
So, what do you think?

534
00:25:13,684 --> 00:25:17,100
That maybe Lucas was attacked
in a kitchen or a restaurant.

535
00:25:17,101 --> 00:25:19,620
Yes. We can'’t forget
about the rice.

536
00:25:19,621 --> 00:25:21,415
Look, we'’ve been
burning it at both ends.

537
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:23,418
Let'’s regroup and hit it hard
in the morning, shall we?

538
00:25:28,803 --> 00:25:29,873
Morgan.

539
00:25:30,943 --> 00:25:33,946
I know why this case
is hitting a nerve.
I feel your frustration.

540
00:25:35,982 --> 00:25:39,191
Look, I'’ve kept my commitment
to digging deeper into Roman.

541
00:25:39,192 --> 00:25:41,781
- But I need to know
that you'’re really--
- It'’s not just about me.

542
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:43,956
In many ways, I had moved on.

543
00:25:44,922 --> 00:25:48,132
My daughter thinking that
she was abandoned by her dad?

544
00:25:49,237 --> 00:25:51,204
That'’s gonna hang over
every moment of her life.

545
00:25:52,861 --> 00:25:57,348
Okay. Go home.
I'’ll see you tomorrow.

546
00:26:19,923 --> 00:26:22,442
Lucas and Blaine
had some nasty run-ins.

547
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:25,410
I would do anything
for my brother, and I have.

548
00:26:25,411 --> 00:26:27,862
I don'’t like
being accused of things
that I didn'’t do.

549
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:57,823
Hi, it'’s me.

550
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:00,065
I can see that.

551
00:27:00,066 --> 00:27:02,621
I just texted you a menu.
Do you like Chinese?

552
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:06,763
Would you like to come in?

553
00:27:08,005 --> 00:27:09,075
Does anybody live here?

554
00:27:12,044 --> 00:27:13,148
Ooh, is that a blue rose?

555
00:27:14,702 --> 00:27:16,737
Love those.

556
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:18,566
You know they don'’t grow
out of the ground like that,
right? People make '’em.

557
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:20,292
Hmm.

558
00:27:20,293 --> 00:27:22,778
The Italians
believe they represent
a longing for the impossible,

559
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:24,296
or a relationship that can'’t--

560
00:27:24,297 --> 00:27:27,818
Morgan, my apartment is not
a case or a crime scene. So...

561
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:31,027
Okay. Got it. Um, okay.

562
00:27:31,028 --> 00:27:33,098
This is what I was thinking,
and feel free to kick me out

563
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:34,755
or tell me to shut up
or whatever,

564
00:27:34,756 --> 00:27:37,724
but I kind of knew
you'’d be here working on this,

565
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:40,727
and I can'’t seem
to shut it down either,
so I thought that maybe we--

566
00:27:40,728 --> 00:27:42,452
You'’d just swing by uninvited
in the hopes

567
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,870
that together
we might find something
that helps with the case.

568
00:27:45,733 --> 00:27:46,768
Yes.

569
00:27:47,424 --> 00:27:49,356
I like it. Let'’s get started.

570
00:27:49,357 --> 00:27:51,048
Oh. Great.

571
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:53,947
- What?
- I just...

572
00:27:53,948 --> 00:27:55,707
If I don'’t eat something soon,
I'’m gonna pass out.

573
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:58,227
So, if you could
just check out the menu.

574
00:27:58,228 --> 00:27:59,297
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

575
00:28:01,403 --> 00:28:04,129
First of all, I don'’t understand
what'’s going on with
the antifreeze, right?

576
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,925
- That doesn'’t make any sense.
- Can you make it make sense?

577
00:28:06,926 --> 00:28:08,616
So, look. Take this.

578
00:28:08,617 --> 00:28:11,447
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?

579
00:28:11,448 --> 00:28:14,415
How are you gonna
look at that face and tell me
that you don'’t hate this face.

580
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:16,901
No. I hate that face,
but we cannot prosecute a face.

581
00:28:16,902 --> 00:28:19,352
Did you see
how tall his hair was?
I don'’t trust that.

582
00:28:20,422 --> 00:28:24,115
But then you wake up
For the sunrise

583
00:28:24,116 --> 00:28:26,186
You know
You don'’t gotta pretend...

584
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:28,844
- I will look through...
- I already looked through
all of those.

585
00:28:28,845 --> 00:28:31,432
Don'’t you
Just wanna wake up...

586
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:34,573
Mmm. Right here,
we'’ve got a flimsy alibi...

587
00:28:34,574 --> 00:28:37,300
- Mm-hmm.
- ...a bad attitude
and, uh, a bruised ego.

588
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:39,026
- So, that'’s motive.
- A bad mustache.

589
00:28:39,027 --> 00:28:40,719
...babe, I think it'’s great

590
00:28:41,374 --> 00:28:43,444
But while in this world

591
00:28:43,445 --> 00:28:49,140
I think
I'’ll take my whiskey neat

592
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:52,695
My coffee black
And my bed at three

593
00:28:52,696 --> 00:28:58,046
You'’re too sweet for me

594
00:28:59,013 --> 00:29:02,602
-  There you go.
- Maybe this was a mistake.

595
00:29:03,224 --> 00:29:05,191
The pop by or ordering Chinese?

596
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,193
- Both.
- Well...

597
00:29:08,194 --> 00:29:10,195
...we are gonna solve
this thing, Gillory.

598
00:29:10,196 --> 00:29:11,956
I can feel it in my bones.

599
00:29:11,957 --> 00:29:14,303
They teach you that
in the academy?
Feeling things in your bones?

600
00:29:14,304 --> 00:29:16,546
I'’m just saying.
I wouldn'’t bet against us.

601
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:18,032
I like the confidence.

602
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:22,519
You know who else would like
that confidence? Tom.

603
00:29:24,245 --> 00:29:25,315
Tom cooks.

604
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:27,662
Wanted to cook me dinner.

605
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:32,183
He asked about last night,
but we are still working
this case.

606
00:29:32,184 --> 00:29:35,324
So, I don'’t see that happening
anytime soon.

607
00:29:37,051 --> 00:29:38,155
It'’ll happen.

608
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,779
Do you want it to happen?

609
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:45,784
Yeah. I think I do.

610
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,791
Her name was Lucia.

611
00:29:54,862 --> 00:29:56,484
When I proposed,
she made that for me.

612
00:29:59,176 --> 00:30:00,626
Meh. It'’s for the best.

613
00:30:01,178 --> 00:30:03,629
She deserved to be with a man
who wasn'’t more in love
with something else.

614
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,943
This.

615
00:30:10,912 --> 00:30:11,948
I'’ll see you later.

616
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:13,570
See ya.

617
00:30:38,146 --> 00:30:39,906
- She'’s back.
- We gotta go. Now.

618
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:41,840
- Go where? Why?
- I'’ll explain it all in the car.

619
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:43,565
But I know who killed Lucas.

620
00:30:46,983 --> 00:30:48,811
And how do you know
it was Edward?

621
00:30:48,812 --> 00:30:50,882
Okay. So, in the late 1870s,

622
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:54,472
a man named Erwin Perzy
was trying to develop
an ultrabright light source

623
00:30:54,473 --> 00:30:55,956
for a surgical lamp.

624
00:30:55,957 --> 00:30:59,822
But what he accidentally
ended up inventing
was the snow globe.

625
00:30:59,823 --> 00:31:01,479
Snow globe?

626
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,137
Morgan, there are
a dozen officers
racing down PCH right now.

627
00:31:04,138 --> 00:31:05,759
Why are we talking about
snow globes?

628
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,693
Because a snow globe
was the murder weapon.

629
00:31:08,245 --> 00:31:10,454
- I think that'’s a bit of a leap.
- Just stay with me, okay?

630
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:13,629
Throughout history,
they'’ve tried
tons of different things

631
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,770
to make the snow
in snow globes float:

632
00:31:16,253 --> 00:31:21,086
Wax, soap, sand, bone fragments,
metal shavings, sawdust,

633
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:23,121
and last but not least...

634
00:31:23,122 --> 00:31:24,778
Rice.

635
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:27,574
And the trace amounts
of glycol found in
Lucas'’s nasal passages...

636
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:29,748
Antifreeze.

637
00:31:29,749 --> 00:31:32,545
Antifreeze is what they put
into snow globes to keep
the liquid from freezing.

638
00:31:33,063 --> 00:31:34,857
So you think Edward used
the snow globe to kill Lucas?

639
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:36,928
I do. Do you remember
when we were in his office?

640
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:39,448
They had all those souvenirs
from their world travels.

641
00:31:39,449 --> 00:31:42,244
Edward was talking about
that one fancy trip
to the Mediterranean.

642
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:44,936
That'’s Italy, Greece,
France and Spain.

643
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:48,146
I saw souvenirs
from Italy, France and Spain.

644
00:31:48,147 --> 00:31:50,115
I did not see
a souvenir from Greece.

645
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:52,219
The snow globe.

646
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,703
That'’s right.
Here'’s what I think happened.

647
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:56,154
I think Lucas
had had it with Blaine.

648
00:31:56,155 --> 00:31:59,226
The affairs, the drugs,
the fraud. He had to go.

649
00:31:59,227 --> 00:32:01,608
But Edward was never gonna
turn his back on his brother.

650
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:05,370
So when Lucas came to Edward
and gave him an ultimatum,

651
00:32:05,371 --> 00:32:07,373
fire Blaine or he spills
all of his secrets,

652
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:11,066
Edward killed Lucas to protect
his brother and the club.

653
00:32:17,314 --> 00:32:19,281
- But then there was Penny.
- The case was cold.

654
00:32:19,282 --> 00:32:20,903
She was the only one
keeping it alive

655
00:32:20,904 --> 00:32:22,767
because she was obsessed with
solving the crime.

656
00:32:22,768 --> 00:32:24,943
And Edward was obsessed
with covering it up.

657
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:27,945
You do realize, Morgan,
this is all circumstantial

658
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,395
unless we can get Edward
to confess.

659
00:32:30,155 --> 00:32:31,432
Great. Let'’s go do that.

660
00:33:00,806 --> 00:33:03,394
On me. Moskowitz, Kingston.
West exits now.

661
00:33:03,395 --> 00:33:04,705
- Got it.
- Copy.

662
00:33:04,706 --> 00:33:06,052
- Morgan. Please remember--
- Yeah. I hang back.

663
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:08,158
You go first.
How could I forget?

664
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:11,990
Everybody,
out of the building right now.
Let'’s go. Nice and slow.

665
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:19,134
- Excuse me.
What the hell is going on?
- Where'’s your brother?

666
00:33:19,135 --> 00:33:21,723
- My brother? Why?
- Where is he?

667
00:33:23,656 --> 00:33:25,175
- In our office.
- Thank you.

668
00:33:30,146 --> 00:33:31,354
Edward?

669
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,191
He'’s on the run.

670
00:33:42,192 --> 00:33:44,469
Suspect is on the move.
I need all exits covered.

671
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,093
He'’s on foot heading west.

672
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,412
Morgan, we gotta get you
someplace safe
until we lock down the area

673
00:33:56,413 --> 00:33:57,965
and get Edward into custody.
Come on.

674
00:33:57,966 --> 00:33:59,209
- Karadec?
- What?

675
00:33:59,968 --> 00:34:01,246
I think I know
where he'’s heading.

676
00:34:22,715 --> 00:34:25,097
Edward, come on down.
It'’s over.

677
00:34:25,684 --> 00:34:27,167
You'’re right.

678
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:28,894
It is over.

679
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:32,552
Hey. Just hold on
for a second, okay?
Let'’s talk about this.

680
00:34:32,553 --> 00:34:34,140
You were just looking out
for your brother.

681
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:36,177
The way you have been
your whole life.

682
00:34:37,247 --> 00:34:40,525
What do you think'’s
gonna happen to Blaine
if you step off that ledge?

683
00:34:40,526 --> 00:34:41,631
Edward.

684
00:34:42,494 --> 00:34:43,529
Ed, she'’s right.

685
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,049
Don'’t do this, man.

686
00:34:48,258 --> 00:34:50,985
Look, you'’re all that I got.
I need you.

687
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:07,933
I'’m gonna be okay.

688
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:11,143
All right. Let'’s go.

689
00:35:19,772 --> 00:35:20,808
Take care of yourself.

690
00:35:27,815 --> 00:35:29,644
Well, I told you
we'’d solve this one.

691
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,543
Look at you being right
about something.

692
00:35:32,544 --> 00:35:34,303
Ha.

693
00:35:34,304 --> 00:35:36,340
Looks like I'’ll be able
to make that date
with Tom after all.

694
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:38,100
You want a ride to his place?

695
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:41,276
No. You can just
drop me off at my car.
I got a few stops to make.

696
00:35:41,277 --> 00:35:42,760
Wine?

697
00:35:42,761 --> 00:35:45,419
Well, wine, but Penny.
I wanna be the one to tell her.

698
00:35:48,594 --> 00:35:49,457
Hmm.

699
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:01,020
Hey.

700
00:36:05,784 --> 00:36:07,958
It was Edward. We got him.

701
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,997
When you'’re ready,
we'’ll fill you in
on everything, okay?

702
00:36:22,732 --> 00:36:26,010
I know it doesn'’t
bring Lucas back,
but I hope that at least--

703
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:27,530
Now... Now I know.

704
00:36:32,397 --> 00:36:33,432
Yeah.

705
00:36:38,057 --> 00:36:39,197
Thank you.

706
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,200
You'’re welcome.

707
00:37:10,676 --> 00:37:12,643
Why is that so funny?

708
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:15,266
I don'’t know.
I just can'’t picture you
in a high school band uniform.

709
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:16,888
- Why not?
- That'’s actually a lie.

710
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:18,062
I can very much picture it.

711
00:37:20,514 --> 00:37:22,204
I just don'’t think
you want me to.

712
00:37:22,205 --> 00:37:24,759
Hey, I was very, very good.

713
00:37:25,415 --> 00:37:29,280
Second chair clarinet.
And those wind section kids
were very competitive.

714
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:32,594
Any chance you still have
that uniform? I wouldn'’t
hate it if you threw it on.

715
00:37:32,595 --> 00:37:34,597
Whoa. Slow down.

716
00:37:35,977 --> 00:37:37,013
That'’s good.

717
00:37:37,565 --> 00:37:40,153
Mmm. Thank you.
They'’re called torrijas.

718
00:37:40,154 --> 00:37:41,637
It'’s actually a family recipe.

719
00:37:41,638 --> 00:37:44,468
Well, then, please thank
your entire family for me.

720
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:45,780
I will.

721
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:47,955
You don'’t know
my last name, do you?

722
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:52,545
Hey, I could tell you,
but I don'’t...
I don'’t wanna rush this.

723
00:37:52,546 --> 00:37:54,548
I really appreciate that.

724
00:37:55,238 --> 00:37:56,307
- It'’s--
- Flores.

725
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:58,378
I see what you did there.

726
00:37:58,379 --> 00:37:59,277
Mm-hmm.

727
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:03,626
I hide it well,
but I'’ve got a lot going on too.

728
00:38:04,937 --> 00:38:07,870
There were some changes
in my life that I had to make

729
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:10,046
that I probably should have made
a long time ago.

730
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,014
It cost me
some relationships that I'’m

731
00:38:14,568 --> 00:38:15,948
still trying to repair.

732
00:38:16,742 --> 00:38:19,296
Don'’t worry I'’m not gonna
unpack it all for you

733
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,437
and ruin this amazing night,
but, um...

734
00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:25,958
The point is...

735
00:38:27,512 --> 00:38:28,616
life is messy,

736
00:38:30,031 --> 00:38:32,171
especially when
it gets to our age.

737
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,208
I'’m so much younger than you.

738
00:38:36,831 --> 00:38:39,524
I just like being around you.
It'’s as simple as that.

739
00:38:41,698 --> 00:38:42,837
So, I'’m thinking...

740
00:38:44,183 --> 00:38:46,116
that if we keep it that way,

741
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:48,602
then, I don'’t know,

742
00:38:49,672 --> 00:38:54,159
maybe the chaos around us
starts to feel
a little less chaotic.

743
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:57,887
Maybe.

744
00:38:58,853 --> 00:39:00,751
You'’re still picturing me
in band, aren'’t you?

745
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:04,168
I mean, not '’cause I want to.
It just won'’t go away.

746
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:05,445
I get it.

747
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:08,932
- Sorry.
- No, go ahead.

748
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:16,111
Hey, Lieutenant.

749
00:39:17,493 --> 00:39:20,736
If a child

750
00:39:20,737 --> 00:39:24,326
A child cries

751
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:27,640
Would you not forgive them?

752
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:29,021
Why don'’t you close that?

753
00:39:29,712 --> 00:39:33,300
Yeah, I might seem so strong

754
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:34,957
Yeah, I might speak...

755
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,201
Okay. I'’m here.

756
00:39:37,098 --> 00:39:39,617
Morgan, when someone'’s
been missing as long as Roman,

757
00:39:39,618 --> 00:39:44,035
it'’s hard to find anything
besides some old impound files

758
00:39:44,036 --> 00:39:46,867
and the diapers he bought
the day he disappeared.

759
00:39:48,524 --> 00:39:50,041
I understand.

760
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:53,044
That'’s why it's taking me
so long to find anything useful,

761
00:39:53,045 --> 00:39:56,773
to find someone to talk to
who might know something.

762
00:39:57,912 --> 00:39:59,913
What are you saying?

763
00:39:59,914 --> 00:40:03,710
I'’m saying that
when I started digging into
every aspect of Roman'’s life,

764
00:40:03,711 --> 00:40:07,543
tracking where he was going
in the days before
he disappeared,

765
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:09,923
I came across a guy.

766
00:40:09,924 --> 00:40:12,479
Someone Roman met with
more than once.

767
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:15,620
Did you get a name?

768
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:17,449
Gio Cornforth.

769
00:40:19,037 --> 00:40:20,762
Ring any bells?

770
00:40:20,763 --> 00:40:23,903
No. I have never heard
that name before.
What do we know about him?

771
00:40:23,904 --> 00:40:26,147
Clean record.
No digital footprint.

772
00:40:27,148 --> 00:40:31,256
But I did find out that Gio
is known as a concierge.

773
00:40:31,808 --> 00:40:33,603
Not the kind normal people use.

774
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:38,436
He procures
certain items for individuals
on both sides of the law.

775
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:42,024
If Roman was dealing
with a guy like that, then,

776
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:44,338
let'’s just say,
it begs a lot of questions.

777
00:40:46,651 --> 00:40:48,998
So we'’re working on a plan
to get him here.

778
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:53,416
Set up an interview.
Get some answers.

779
00:40:56,074 --> 00:40:58,007
This Gio sounds like
a hard guy to find.

780
00:40:59,387 --> 00:41:00,595
He is.

781
00:41:00,596 --> 00:41:02,183
But you found him, didn'’t you?

782
00:41:02,736 --> 00:41:03,599
I did.

783
00:41:05,911 --> 00:41:07,119
When did you do all this?

784
00:41:08,673 --> 00:41:10,468
In the shadows
when no one was looking.

785
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:14,989
And that'’s how it stays
until we know a lot more
than we know now.

786
00:41:16,957 --> 00:41:17,820
Okay?

787
00:41:20,408 --> 00:41:24,408
Okay.
