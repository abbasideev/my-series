1
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,586
Hey.

2
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,726
Sounds like someone had a night.

3
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,510
- My god.
- What's going on?

4
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,736
I'm in Elaine's office.

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,286
Please tell me she didn't make you work

6
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,846
after the party last night.

7
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,010
- What happened?
- Are you okay?

8
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,260
Sam? Are you there?

9
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,826
Yeah, I can fix this. I-I need tape.

10
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,306
Tape? What... what tape?

11
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,826
Okay. I'm sorry. I gotta go.

12
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:05,966
Sam, what are you fixing?

13
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,340
Do you need help?

14
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,676
Elaine.

15
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,636
Elaine!

16
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,560
God.

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,510
Sure.

18
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,806
- Yeah?
- Hey. You busy?

19
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,736
Ludo's got the kids till Tuesday,

20
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,986
so I am treating myself
to some deep cleaning.

21
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,886
- What's up?
- A homicide call just came in

22
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,266
at a company called metkair.

23
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,856
I'm headed there now.

24
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,576
And you'd like me to join you?

25
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Yes, I would like you to join.

26
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,276
Metkair has the whole floor.

27
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,966
What happened in here?

28
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,626
There was a party last
night to celebrate the launch

29
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,146
of a new product.

30
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,906
I heard it got pretty wild.

31
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,736
- When exactly was the party?
- The party started at 8:00.

32
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,566
The last person stumbled
out the door around midnight.

33
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,146
Can you get us a list of attendees?

34
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,086
You got it. No one
enters without signing in.

35
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,946
- Building policy. This way.
- We tested it

36
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,636
<i>on some special children,
who saw immediate results.</i>

37
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,226
<i>With just a few breaths of the kanairy,</i>

38
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,956
<i>your child's anxiety</i>

39
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,266
<i>is proven to diminish by 85%.</i>

40
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,686
<i>This is incredible. And
it's all homeopathic.</i>

41
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,956
- I'll get you that guest list.
- No medicines. No side effects.

42
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,370
Thank you.

43
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,376
Yeah, that. Good morning.

44
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,896
- Hey.
- Hi.

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,340
Over here.

46
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,626
We have a Elaine bar ton,

47
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,720
founder and ceo of metkair corp.

48
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:04,560
"Female innovator of the year, 2024."

49
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,916
The shatter pattern on this glass

50
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,026
it's about the size of a fist.

51
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,196
Possibly from a fight that
ended in Elaine's murder.

52
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,576
Or the murderer was
trying to send a message.

53
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,136
- What does this mean?
- Let's rush the autopsy

54
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,656
and hope we can lift
prints off that trophy.

55
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,176
You said an employee called 911?

56
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,176
Yeah. Elaine's assistant,
Samantha wozniak.

57
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,826
She's with an officer now.

58
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,526
Is she a potential witness?

59
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,216
She may be more than a witness.

60
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,216
How long did you work for Elaine?

61
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,466
About four years.

62
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,426
Do you have any idea what happened?

63
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,466
I... I don't remember.

64
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,606
Did you black out?

65
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,026
I'm not much of a drinker in general,

66
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,916
and I started some new meds recently,

67
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,166
so maybe the... the two really don't mix.

68
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,406
God, I'm sorry. I'm not helping, am I?

69
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,416
Well, I assume that you
probably knew Elaine

70
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,866
better than anybody else
here, being her assistant, right?

71
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,176
Why don't you tell us what she was like?

72
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,726
Elaine was my hero.

73
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,116
I watched this video of her
speaking when I was a kid.

74
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,526
I mean, she's the reason
I applied to Stanford.

75
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,086
Just tracked her down
and begged her to hire me.

76
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,846
I mean, being an
assistant isn't glamorous,

77
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,816
- but I'm used to grunt work.
- You went to Stanford,

78
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,406
but you're used to grunt work?

79
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,026
Well, not everyone who goes there

80
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,266
came straight from a country club.

81
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,206
You know, I had a scholarship,
and I worked two jobs,

82
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,276
yeah, but I still graduated with honors.

83
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,176
So you liked working for Elaine?

84
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,206
Of course.

85
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:36,790
She was a visionary.

86
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,930
Sam, have you ever
heard of a duchenne smile?

87
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,606
A duchenne smile is a
smile that reaches the eyes.

88
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,916
It's genuine, as opposed
to a pan am smile

89
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,676
which stops at the mouth. It's insincere.

90
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,296
It's the kind of fake smile

91
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,856
a pan am flight attendant might give,

92
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,506
or a woman who is saying she
loved her boss a little bit more

93
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,190
than she really did.

94
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,556
I believed in Elaine's vision.

95
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,276
But?

96
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,286
She wasn't easy.

97
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,246
And I couldn't get everything right, and...

98
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,286
Whatever mistake I made, I
just wouldn't hear the end of it.

99
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,946
That sucks. I'm sorry.

100
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,256
It got worse the closer we
got to the kanairy launch.

101
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,606
She... she got secretive. Just paranoid.

102
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,296
She had new locks put on her door.

103
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,786
It just felt like she had
eyes and ears everywhere.

104
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,306
We were rushing to scale up production.

105
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,956
Every day was hell.

106
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,166
And how much can
one person take, right?

107
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,130
Wait. You... you don't think that I...

108
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,246
No, I would remember that.

109
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,836
Sam doesn't remember
what happened last night.

110
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's see what her stuff has to say.

111
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,046
You don't believe her.

112
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,776
You know, a promising young
graduate pins her dreams

113
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,956
to a lady who makes her life hell.

114
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,436
That would be motive.

115
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,336
And Sam had means
and opportunity, too.

116
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,956
So if the prints come
back on that trophy...

117
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,546
There are so many
questions in that crime scene

118
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,616
that still need answers.
Please keep an open mind.

119
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,516
Okay.

120
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,346
Sam's web history.

121
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,656
A search last night at 10:21 P.M. for...

122
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,316
Gibberish.

123
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,216
Okay. Too drunk to type.

124
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,806
Look at these.

125
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,806
Okay, so those could have
interacted with the alcohol

126
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,356
and made her black
out, just like she said.

127
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,596
Just because you don't
remember committing a crime

128
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,140
doesn't mean you didn't do it.

129
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,120
You might want to
keep an open mind, too.

130
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,880
What?

131
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,470
That's not great.

132
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,666
<i>Looks like you hated your
boss, and maybe one night</i>

133
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,356
<i>- after too many drinks, you...
- I didn't kill Elaine.</i>

134
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,906
<i>- Or you don't remember?
- This poor kid. I've been there.</i>

135
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,356
You wouldn't believe how
many jerks I've worked for.

136
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,226
I'm familiar with your
work history, Morgan.

137
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,226
Sam's obviously smart. She's got grit.

138
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,016
I just wish I could go back in time

139
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,746
and tell her she's got
the power to walk away.

140
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,026
Maybe. But this young woman seems

141
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,716
to really have believed
in what she was doing.

142
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,966
And in her boss, tough
as she might have been.

143
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,686
When you find your calling,
it changes the calculus.

144
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,246
You'd be surprised at all the crap

145
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,556
you're willing to put up with.

146
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,766
The question is, did
Elaine push Sam so hard

147
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,596
that it wasn't worth it anymore?

148
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,256
Sam wozniak

149
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,766
is still saying she remembers nothing.

150
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,016
She's agreed to stay
at the station for now.

151
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,666
Well, yeah. She wants to help.

152
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,056
Morgan, you know I love

153
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,776
how you always stick
up for the underdog.

154
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,886
But sometimes good
people do bad things

155
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,716
and we have to hold them accountable.

156
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,406
Yeah, obviously, I know that.

157
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,686
I'm just saying... I don't
think it applies in this situation.

158
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,236
I'll have Daphne and oz
start contacting everyone

159
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,616
on the guest list last night.

160
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,866
We need to find out
who saw what and when.

161
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,686
And I need you to break the news

162
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,726
to Elaine's husband, Eric bar ton.

163
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,680
Okay, good. It's usually
the husband anyway.

164
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,946
When Elaine didn't
come home last night,

165
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,746
I-I just figured she'd stayed
after the party to work late.

166
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,436
We're very sorry.

167
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,166
What can you tell us about Elaine?

168
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,096
Where do I start?

169
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,856
The only thing bigger than
Elaine's ambition was her heart.

170
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,856
She quit medical school to revolutionize

171
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,136
the healthcare industry.

172
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,936
I was her first investor.

173
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:39,526
When I saw her passion,
I was immediately in...

174
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,806
In every sense of the word.

175
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,520
What time did you last see Elaine?

176
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,776
I left around 10:00.

177
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,536
The party was in full swing
with Elaine at the center of it.

178
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,026
It was her night to shine. And she did.

179
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,196
She was pitch-perfect.

180
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,026
Were you and Elaine
getting along lately?

181
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,436
Is there anything we should know?

182
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,446
We got along fine.

183
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,996
Sure, things have been tense.

184
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,726
She had just closed a
huge, distribution deal.

185
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,866
It was stressful.

186
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,806
I'm sorry. I-I just gotta know...
what exactly happened?

187
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,326
It appears she was attacked in her office.

188
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,356
Someone used one of
her trophies as a weapon.

189
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,396
My god.

190
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,916
Any suspects?

191
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,156
- One.
- Who?

192
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,166
We'll share more when we can,

193
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,096
but for now, can you tell us
if your wife had any enemies?

194
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,166
Elaine felt that the work she
was doing would help millions.

195
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,686
So when people got in the way of that,

196
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,106
she let them know.

197
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,176
She had a way of
bending people to her will.

198
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,216
Did she ever bend them
far enough to break?

199
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,636
She demanded a lot of her employees.

200
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,310
Enough for them to want her dead?

201
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,590
You'd have to ask them.

202
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,546
If I may.

203
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,826
- Thanks.
- You're Morgan, right?

204
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,580
I'm Tom. Janitorial staff.

205
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,356
Actually, I've been
meaning to talk to you.

206
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,246
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

207
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,636
I couldn't help but notice
you've been smudging up

208
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,356
the glass of the bullpen doors

209
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,566
with your cheesy chip fingers.

210
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,566
What makes you think that's me?

211
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,320
Well, for starters, the
smudges are orange.

212
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,196
A lot of people work on this floor, Tom.

213
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,600
I can't be the only one who
likes chips and has fingers.

214
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,516
I guess I should leave
the police work to you?

215
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,066
I'll tell you what.

216
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,996
If I see anything, I'll
be sure to let you know.

217
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,556
- Thanks.
- You got it.

218
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,370
- I'm gonna get back to work.
- Okay.

219
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,086
Have we confirmed Eric left
the party when he said he did?

220
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,636
Not yet.

221
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,126
Preliminary tox is back on Sam.

222
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,396
Looks like she had more than
enough Diazepam and alcohol

223
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,746
in her system to trigger
anterograde amnesia.

224
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,886
Here's something.

225
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,996
The last check Elaine
cut was written last night

226
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,406
made out to "cash."

227
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,726
$45,623. Pretty specific.

228
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,686
So we keep tabs on Elaine's account,

229
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,276
see if anybody cashes it.

230
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,626
And we have no idea why "forever"

231
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,936
was written on the wall?

232
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,736
- Nope. Not yet.
- It's driving me nuts.

233
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,766
- Time of death?
- M.E's still working on that.

234
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,116
Yeah, and we'll have prints
off that murder weapon soon.

235
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,466
My money's on Sam.

236
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,946
Hi. How can I help you?

237
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,776
Hi. Nina wong. I'm here
about Elaine bar ton.

238
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,296
We need to talk to these party guests,

239
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,250
try to nail down a timeline.

240
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,686
<i>Nina, how did you know Elaine?</i>

241
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,346
When she was first getting
metkair off the ground,

242
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,236
she hired me as her assistant.

243
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,446
Tell me about the party last night.

244
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,136
It was a lovely celebration.

245
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,176
Elaine was thrilled
about the distribution deal

246
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,386
with saveporium.

247
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,286
<i>I was so proud of her.</i>

248
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,046
I left around 9:30.

249
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,806
<i>Did you notice anything
out of the ordinary?</i>

250
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,046
Not really. I was enjoying myself.

251
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,986
<i>We don't get to have
a lot of fun at metkair.</i>

252
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,776
The party was honestly nice.

253
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,196
I couldn't wait to get out of there.

254
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,296
<i>We all expected Elaine
to be in a better mood,</i>

255
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,546
but I don't know.

256
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,506
The vibe was weird.

257
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,786
I wanted to leave early,

258
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,406
but Wanda insisted on staying

259
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,066
until she sang "rolling in the deep."

260
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,306
It's kind of my anthem.

261
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,060
We left as soon as she was done.

262
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,286
But we heard an argument in
Elaine's office on our way out.

263
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,140
<i>And you didn't think to go in?</i>

264
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,296
It wasn't unusual for Elaine
to be cussing someone out.

265
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,150
<i>I feel bad, but... I was
just glad it wasn't me.</i>

266
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,786
Time of death was around 11:00 P.M.

267
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,446
And how'd you get there?

268
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,586
Well, the karaoke machine
keeps a record of all the songs

269
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,626
that were sung when,
so I asked the vendor

270
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,526
to give me a copy of the playlist.

271
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,006
According to the playlist,

272
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,906
"rolling in the deep" was played at 10:53.

273
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,696
That is the song that Wanda sang

274
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,946
right before employees
heard the fight between Elaine

275
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,286
and an unknown person.

276
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,186
- Right.
- After that,

277
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,876
the entire sales team
sang "since u been gone,"

278
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,800
which would have been really loud, right?

279
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,150
And yet the argument
was heard over the song.

280
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,816
Your decision to approach me like this!

281
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,716
And that was from 10:58 to 11:01.

282
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,096
- Okay.
- Next, Amanda from reception

283
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,616
sings "nothing compares 2 u."

284
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,516
A quiet song sung by a quiet woman,

285
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,036
and yet nobody heard a thing.

286
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,586
So the struggle had to
have been over by then.

287
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,176
And no one reported
seeing Elaine after that.

288
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,386
That's right, so she was
killed in the three minutes

289
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,246
between 10:58 and 11:01.

290
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,736
- Good work, gillory.
- Thank you.

291
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,256
I gotta see if I can dig around

292
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,186
and get those memories out of Sam.

293
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,916
Whatever you want. It's on me.

294
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,816
I'm fine, thank you.

295
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,296
No, you have to eat something.

296
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,816
You got to be starving.

297
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,150
- Cheese curls.
- Right.

298
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,166
Okay. There you go.

299
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,440
Cheers.

300
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,790
Thank you for being so nice to me.

301
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,486
Well, listen, I didn't
graduate from Stanford,

302
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,526
but I have been where
you are... overqualified

303
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,806
and treated like crap by your boss.

304
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,496
Just hang in there, okay?

305
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,436
I can't believe this is happening.

306
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,886
Yeah.

307
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,606
Hey. Look at me. Look at me.

308
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,990
Take a deep breath. Let me see it.

309
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,956
Now calm your brain down.

310
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,166
It's easier said than done. I know.

311
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,346
I'm so scared.

312
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,136
I can't remember anything.

313
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,906
- What if I...
- Killed your boss? No.

314
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,076
Fantasized about killing your boss?

315
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,836
Who hasn't?

316
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,356
We're gonna figure out
what happened, okay?

317
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,566
But you gotta help me.

318
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,986
Of course.

319
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,460
Come here.

320
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,026
- Check your pockets.
- I don't have any pockets.

321
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,136
I know, so check all
the places you'd put stuff

322
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,360
if you didn't have pockets.

323
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,936
What is it?

324
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,526
God.

325
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,076
Okay. It's not ideal.

326
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,590
I might as well just confess now.

327
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,940
I recognize that lipstick.

328
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,946
That's your lipstick, but on Sam's mouth.

329
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,956
Now, you claimed that you were
at your desk all night, Denise,

330
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,010
so how do you explain this?

331
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,686
Tell us exactly what happened,
Denise. The truth this time.

332
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,306
- You need this job.
- Yeah, and what you did

333
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,136
last night could get you fired.

334
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,796
It's not just about that.

335
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,556
Someone lost their life last night.

336
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,966
And if I let a killer through the door...

337
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,116
No, we're not there yet. Let me guess.

338
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,566
Your job is boring.

339
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,046
Very.

340
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,566
I worked at the dmv
in Van nuys one time.

341
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,666
I was a mailing machine operator.

342
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,086
I used every opportunity
to leave my station.

343
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,336
Did you abandon your post last night?

344
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,266
The party sounded like such a good time.

345
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,786
Sam looked amazing.

346
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,646
I'd always had a thing for her.

347
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,966
So I figured if I was at the party,

348
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,416
I could at least keep an eye on things.

349
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,826
Plus, I'd already signed
everyone in on the invite list,

350
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,936
so I figured it was okay.

351
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,766
Had a couple drinks,

352
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,216
and then Sam and I started talking and...

353
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,666
Keep going.

354
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,906
We kissed a little. Didn't last long.

355
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,986
Sam went to the
bathroom, so I waited for her.

356
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,266
But then some other woman came out.

357
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,956
Someone I didn't recognize.

358
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,156
- Someone not on the list?
- Exactly.

359
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,746
I tried to chase after her,

360
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,336
but she booked it for the elevator

361
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,266
and the doors closed
before I could get to her.

362
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,856
So, to be clear, you didn't
see her leave the building?

363
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,686
- Nah.
- What time was this?

364
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,276
Sometime after 10:00, I think.

365
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,896
Please tell me you got
a good look at this lady.

366
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,146
Brownish hair, average build.

367
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,006
Is that it? That's all you got?

368
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,526
No. She had this thing stuck to her arm.

369
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,636
It was, like, a square, plastic-looking

370
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,356
I don't know what. It was, like, right here.

371
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,056
The size of a matchbook?

372
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,660
Yeah, give or take.

373
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,096
- Is it this woman?
- That's her.

374
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,096
- That was cool.
- It's an Insulin pump.

375
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,786
She's diabetic.

376
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,956
This is definitely the
woman you saw last night?

377
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,376
Yeah, 100%.

378
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,306
Carmen, Nico, and Arturo jimenez.

379
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,750
Let's find out what Carmen
has to say for herself.

380
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,696
- Karadec.
- It's Daphne. Bad news.

381
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,326
They were unable to pull any
prints from the murder weapon.

382
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,226
- Damn.
- Okay. Sam's home.

383
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,256
Her mom's driving up from
San Diego to be with her.

384
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,886
- Stop texting suspects.
- One more thing.

385
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,506
M.e. Confirmed time of death
was likely around 11:00 P.M.

386
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,956
During "since u been gone."

387
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,236
Thanks, daph.

388
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,196
No. Thank you, Kelly Clarkson.

389
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,260
All right.

390
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,516
We heard about Elaine bar ton.

391
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,756
What a loss.

392
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,626
- You knew her personally?
- Yes.

393
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,726
Our son, Nico, was one
of the earliest adopters

394
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,866
of the kanairy.

395
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,766
It changed his life.

396
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,216
Mrs. Jimenez, we understand

397
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,566
that you were at the kanairy launch party.

398
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,606
Right?

399
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,396
We talked to the security
guard that you ran from.

400
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,180
- You know?
- Yes, I was there.

401
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,126
Well, considering Elaine bar ton is dead,

402
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,120
we need to know why
you crashed that party.

403
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,306
- I can't talk to you.
- You can't or you won't?

404
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,586
Well, I can talk.

405
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:58,276
I got to say, this house is gorgeous.

406
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,906
I can't help but notice, though

407
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:04,456
the stuff that you have
doesn't quite fill up the space.

408
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,666
You know? That, and the
temporary parking pass I saw,

409
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:11,256
makes me think you
guys just moved in recently.

410
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,296
- A couple of months ago.
- Congratulations.

411
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,506
I-I'm doing the math here, and I'm

412
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,336
something's just not quite adding up.

413
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,926
Between Carmen's retail job
and Arturo being out of work,

414
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,586
how do you guys afford a place like this?

415
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,686
I saw your unemployment
check next to your name tag

416
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,246
on the side table over there.

417
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,796
You know, that's
where I dump all my crap

418
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,516
when I get home, too.

419
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,100
Guess some things don't change,
no matter how big your house is.

420
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,496
I think we're done here.

421
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

422
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,026
I think it's time we
move this conversation

423
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,446
to the police station.

424
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,780
Wouldn't you agree?

425
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,316
- Carmen, humor me.
- Let's see how close I can get

426
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,496
to what really happened
between you and Elaine?

427
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,256
I think you were part of a big old scheme.

428
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,876
<i>Metkair pays you to
fabricate a heartwarming story</i>

429
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,776
<i>about how well the kanairy works,</i>

430
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,196
<i>because every product needs
a good success story, right?</i>

431
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,676
But deals like that often sour, don't they?

432
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,506
Maybe Elaine got tired of paying you.

433
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,096
Maybe you started asking for more cash

434
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,880
in exchange for your cooperation.

435
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,696
I can put you at the scene of the crime

436
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,656
and the wounds on your
hand that you refuse to explain

437
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,976
certainly give me probable cause.

438
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,496
I'm offering you one
last shot to come clean.

439
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,520
What's it gonna be?

440
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,546
If she's innocent, why won't she talk?

441
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,996
And if she's guilty, why
hasn't she called a lawyer?

442
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,486
Daphne, look into their financials.

443
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,130
Who's paying their mortgage?

444
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,620
Morgan? You all right?

445
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,116
It seemed like gibberish.

446
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,256
- What?
- Sam's web search.

447
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,140
Remember? It made no sense.

448
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,536
Wasn't she heavily intoxicated?

449
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,676
- Exactly.
- Her hands were shifted over.

450
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,500
Had they been in the right place...

451
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,996
That is why the word
"forever" was written

452
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,610
on the wall in Elaine's office.

453
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,496
I think I can get Carmen to talk.

454
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,000
- Take Morgan with you.
- No. Just me.

455
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,116
The kanairy was giving
off forever chemicals,

456
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,566
and pfa exposure can cause asthma.

457
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,296
Metkair's buying your silence

458
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,406
because their product was hurting kids.

459
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,056
And one of those kids was yours.

460
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,336
Certainly explains that nice
house that you're living in.

461
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,586
And it explains why Nico
wasn't running around in the yard

462
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,260
with the other kids.

463
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,896
He couldn't.

464
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,176
But that was your little boy.

465
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,380
Money could not heal him,
and it could not fix your pain.

466
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,900
Every mother has her limit.

467
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,916
Carmen, there is no chance I
would be able to control myself

468
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,530
if someone hurt my son
the way Nico was hurt.

469
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,740
Are you ready to tell me what
happened in Elaine's office?

470
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,656
At first, I was okay taking the money.

471
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,586
It helped with the doctor bills...

472
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,346
Let us move away from the freeway.

473
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:04,666
But ultimately... I
couldn't live with myself.

474
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:10,496
Nothing they gave us changed
the fact that my son was struggling.

475
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,226
I wanted to destroy them.

476
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,296
So you went to that party to get revenge?

477
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,846
The first thing I saw was
people dancing, singing,

478
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,026
celebrating that device, that woman.

479
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,376
I couldn't stomach it.

480
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,026
So I decided to go to her office,

481
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,066
wait for her to come in so I could tell her

482
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,796
exactly what I thought about her.

483
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,486
And that's when you lost it.

484
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,316
Sitting there

485
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,346
I just got angrier and angrier.

486
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,866
I grabbed a marker and
wrote "forever" on the wall.

487
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,146
And then I stabbed a stupid stuffed bird

488
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,186
with a letter opener, and it slipped.

489
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,356
And I cut my hand.

490
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,366
Then that's when Elaine walked in.

491
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,226
Before I could even say my piece,

492
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,476
she said that she would
Bury me in lawsuits

493
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,816
because of the ndas if
I tried to go against her.

494
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,686
Threatened to stop the payments,
even if her husband disagreed.

495
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,726
I wanted to hurt her.

496
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,726
- But...
- But what?

497
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,246
I chickened out.

498
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,246
Not what I was expecting.

499
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,076
<i>Hurting Elaine wouldn't help my son.</i>

500
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,696
Me neither.

501
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,596
<i>She had all the power,
and we both knew it.</i>

502
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,356
So I turned to leave, and as I walked out,

503
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,356
I did punch her stupid face

504
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,466
the one framed on the wall.

505
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,406
Okay. Carmen, I want to believe you,

506
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,406
but somebody murdered Elaine.

507
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,710
I swear... she was alive when I left.

508
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,486
Okay, this is a weird question,

509
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,486
but is there any chance
you remember what song

510
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,146
was being sung on
karaoke when you left?

511
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,766
Chili peppers. "Californication," I think.

512
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,356
10:15.

513
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,776
Can anyone corroborate this story?

514
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,286
Yeah.

515
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,566
I ran into a drunk young
woman in the bathroom.

516
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,366
I was crying, and she was
so sweet, trying to comfort me.

517
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,196
And then she got just as upset as me

518
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,616
when I told her what
Elaine had done to my son.

519
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,646
I don't remember her
name, but she was wearing a

520
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,446
a sparkly floral dress.

521
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,600
Yeah.

522
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,526
So Sam already wanted to stab her boss.

523
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,186
Then a crying mother tells her
about the pfas and the kanairy.

524
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,976
I think we need another
round of interrogation.

525
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,116
Okay, just hang on one second, okay?

526
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,466
From what Carmen said,

527
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,296
it sounds like there was a disagreement

528
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,986
between Eric and Elaine
when it came to these payouts.

529
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,436
He was the money behind the operation.

530
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,126
If she strong-armed
him to participate in fraud,

531
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,436
maybe he changed his mind.

532
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,786
Yeah, or he didn't want to go to jail.

533
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,196
I mean, that sounds like a motive.

534
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,376
- Maybe, but, Morgan...
- listen, I get it.

535
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,206
Sam is still a suspect. I know.

536
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,446
And by all means,
continue to ask her questions

537
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,826
that she won't be able to answer

538
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,486
'cause she still doesn't
remember anything.

539
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,966
But I feel like you and
I could probably think

540
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,310
of better ways to spend our time.

541
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,356
That was rude. And I'm sorry.

542
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,836
Go talk to Eric.

543
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,256
Find out what he knew
about those payouts

544
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,396
and whether or not he
and Elaine were at odds.

545
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,226
It's been hard to put one
foot in front of the other,

546
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,636
- but the truth is...
- Sorry.

547
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,396
Did we just hear you say
something about the "truth"?

548
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,506
Excuse me. You can't just waltz in here.

549
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,546
- We already waltzed.
- Hey, Eric,

550
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,330
we know that you and Elaine
were buying people's silence.

551
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:21,470
Everyone out except horn stock.

552
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,526
My lawyer. Tread lightly.

553
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,866
- Is that a threat?
- It's a warning.

554
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,046
He's not to be trifled with.

555
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,930
Will you look at that? Neither are we.

556
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,256
Go ahead.

557
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,356
We spoke to Carmen
jimenez about her son, Nico,

558
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,226
and, I'm guessing they were

559
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,816
just one of many
families receiving payouts.

560
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,576
Those were perfectly legal contracts

561
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,646
under California civil code 1550,

562
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:51,376
which you wouldn't know because
you're obviously not lawyers.

563
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,096
He's right... I'm not a lawyer.

564
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,856
But I did pick up a
couple of cleaning shifts

565
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,516
- at a legal library.
- Is there a point to all this?

566
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,626
The point is, section
12 of the securities act

567
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,556
does not look kindly on companies

568
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,496
that have materially false statements

569
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,496
in their investor prospectuses.

570
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,906
Now, in layman's terms,

571
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,216
that means you raised
a bunch of money,

572
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,256
but you didn't tell the investors

573
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,436
that your product was hurting
people, so you could go to jail.

574
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,256
Now, to me,

575
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,296
that seems like a reason
that a husband and a wife

576
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,080
would get into an altercation.

577
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,826
You're gonna go?

578
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,360
You can.

579
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:38,416
Carmen signed Nico up for
the very first round of testing.

580
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,410
Our prototype worked like magic.

581
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,706
And then the health issues cropped up.

582
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,676
Elaine promised to find
a fix, and I provided...

583
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,646
Financial redress, for the
jimenez family and others.

584
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,956
"Financial redress."

585
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,676
That's a fancy way to say hush money.

586
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,126
And the fda never got involved at all?

587
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,306
The kanairy isn't a medical device.

588
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,546
It's homeopathic, so we
don't need fda approval.

589
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,826
Right, because why would
there be guidelines on a product

590
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,610
that children put in their mouths?

591
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,936
Our latest model was so close, but,

592
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,456
but you couldn't have
bad press kill your launch.

593
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,790
I didn't think we were
ready for the launch at all.

594
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,110
These families that were harmed...

595
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,186
You made them a promise.

596
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,296
Elaine was like a runaway train.

597
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,816
She felt the distribution
deal was too good to pass up.

598
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,376
So I went to extremes to stop her.

599
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,996
What kind of extremes?

600
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,920
Not the kind that you're thinking of.

601
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,486
I was parallel tracking
with some developers,

602
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,796
taking my jet up to palo alto every week,

603
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,766
trying to come up with a solution.

604
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,766
We still can't confirm that
you were home at 10 P.M.

605
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,386
The night that Elaine died.

606
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:50,006
I didn't kill Elaine.

607
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,396
I loved her.

608
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,830
I just didn't love what she'd become.

609
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,366
<i>So, here's the story behind the kanairy.</i>

610
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,856
<i>I don't have kids of my own,</i>

611
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,746
<i>but I do have a niece,</i>

612
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:09,206
<i>which is even better
because I can spoil her rotten.</i>

613
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,616
<i>One day a couple years
ago, she's at my house</i>

614
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,416
<i>and she starts having a panic attack</i>

615
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,896
<i>and can't breathe.</i>

616
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,106
<i>So, I'm an inventor... I improvise.</i>

617
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:22,006
<i>I grab a kazoo, if you can believe it,</i>

618
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,626
<i>some essential oils,
and I put a few drops...</i>

619
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,736
You're lying.

620
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,776
Sorry to interrupt.

621
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,426
Looks like someone
made a mess around you.

622
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,606
- Yeah.
- Someone did.

623
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,886
- Mind if I take care of it?
- Right now?

624
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,056
Yeah. I need to wrap
up and get out of here.

625
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,856
I go to nursing school at
night, and I don't want to be late.

626
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,476
Hang on.

627
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,376
You'd rather be a nurse than a janitor?

628
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,996
No, this is just a backup plan

629
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,686
in case the janitor thing doesn't work out.

630
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,896
- I see.
- That makes sense.

631
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,626
Okay, well, I will clean up
after myself this one time.

632
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,556
Appreciate that. See you tomorrow.

633
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,046
See you tomorrow.

634
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,526
<i>I don't have kids of my own,</i>

635
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,286
<i>but I do have a niece,</i>

636
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,550
<i>which is even better
because I can spoil her rotten.</i>

637
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,746
If you had a niece you adored

638
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,636
and she made you rich and famous,

639
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,786
wouldn't you have a
picture of her somewhere?

640
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,226
Well, I have a nephew I adore,

641
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,126
and I have tons of photos of him.

642
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,616
He hasn't made me rich
and famous or anything,

643
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,406
- but there's still time.
- Yeah, right?

644
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,206
I mean, I have a million of these.

645
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,516
- Kids?
- Pictures.

646
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,516
- They're cute.
- Thank you, but not the point.

647
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,006
The point is she's lying.

648
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:29,106
The kazoo, the essential
oils, the whole thing.

649
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,130
What does this smell like to you?

650
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,736
- Grandma's purse.
- Right?

651
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,426
Peppermint, ginger, and licorice.

652
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,806
Those are three of the
eight xiao yao San herbs.

653
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,016
It's a formulation in
traditional Chinese medicine

654
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,366
used to relieve stress, treat
depression, lower anxiety.

655
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:47,126
The problem is, Elaine's
background is western medicine.

656
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,746
All of her inventions before
the kanairy were western-based.

657
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,546
So why isn't she just using,
like, lavender and chamomile

658
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,516
and other boring white people herbs?

659
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,856
Where'd she get a
traditional Chinese formula?

660
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,400
Does she have an acupuncturist?

661
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,456
Elaine was thrilled
about the distribution deal

662
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,106
with saveporium.

663
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,750
I was so proud of her.

664
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,116
Nina had cupping marks on her back.

665
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,186
<i>She is into traditional Chinese medicine.</i>

666
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,636
You know what else Nina has?

667
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,086
- What?
- A daughter.

668
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,536
You think Nina's daughter made
this woman rich and famous?

669
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,366
I think Nina made the first
prototype for her daughter

670
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,166
and shared the
information with her boss.

671
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,236
And how would you feel if
someone was about to make

672
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,096
millions of dollars off of your idea,

673
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,826
but it was hurting people when
it was supposed to help them?

674
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,306
Pretty sure I'd be mad.

675
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,416
Yes, Tom.

676
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,580
I think you'd be very mad.

677
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,876
So, tell me about the kanairy, Nina.

678
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,380
Was it your idea?

679
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,676
My daughter, Alice,

680
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,016
she struggles with panic attacks.

681
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,646
One morning, she was
having a pretty bad episode,

682
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,266
and I just needed to get her to breathe,

683
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,436
so I grabbed her kazoo

684
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,136
and I put a drop of essential oil on it

685
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,966
and I told her to close her eyes

686
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:05,686
and make the kazoo sound
for as long as she could.

687
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:08,866
And, it actually calmed her down.

688
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,036
And when I shared the
story with Elaine, she lit up.

689
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,046
Good work, Morgan.

690
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,216
So, Elaine took your idea and ran with it.

691
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,946
Well, with my blessing.

692
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,946
I wanted her to help
other kids like my daughter.

693
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,876
- Did she pay you for the idea?
- Yes.

694
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,676
And it allowed me to go
and live a life that I wanted,

695
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,886
a quieter one with my
daughter up in the bay area.

696
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,746
I see.

697
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,260
Where were you at 11 P.M.
on the night of the murder?

698
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,740
Walking back to my hotel.

699
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,780
Detective, I didn't kill her.

700
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,486
Look, I've heard the rumors, and I know

701
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:46,036
that Elaine has changed a
lot since we worked together.

702
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,246
But I have to believe that
whatever was going on,

703
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,930
she still had good intentions.

704
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,976
Elaine was this kid from Missouri

705
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,830
with a dream to help people.

706
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,606
Her first invention in med
school, it wasn't flashy.

707
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:01,980
It was a solvent that
removed medical tape gently.

708
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,926
She saw all these sick
people getting poked with ivs,

709
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,886
and she said that if
she couldn't save them

710
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,896
from the needles, then
at least she could help

711
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,300
reduce the irritation from the adhesives.

712
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,446
That's the Elaine that I knew.

713
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,796
We'll check with the hotel,

714
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,146
see what time she swiped the key card.

715
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,766
She's telling the truth about
how much she loved Elaine.

716
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,590
You see that smile.

717
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,946
Still doesn't mean she didn't kill her.

718
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,606
This whole thing has been awful.

719
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,496
My friend died.

720
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,746
She was murdered with her
own trophy at her own party.

721
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:41,716
This is... this is horrific.

722
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,140
How long have you and Eric
bar ton been sleeping together?

723
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,066
What?

724
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,376
Well, the only people who
knew exactly how Elaine died

725
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,006
are the murderer

726
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,586
and Elaine's husband,
because we told him.

727
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,656
So either you killed Elaine,

728
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,046
or you're having an
affair with her husband.

729
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,340
Or both.

730
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,636
You know, Eric mentioned multiple trips

731
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,466
on a private jet to palo alto.

732
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,156
Is it safe to assume that he
was going there to see you?

733
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,196
Only because we were both...

734
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,886
Trying to do what was
best for the kanairy.

735
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:15,166
Eric and I thought that
we could change her mind

736
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:18,886
and... and get her to... Do the right thing.

737
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:21,096
And then we just started
spending all this time together

738
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,176
- and... and we started to...
- Do the wrong thing?

739
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,966
I know it looks bad,

740
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:29,480
but we were both fighting
for something we loved.

741
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,186
And then we fell in love.

742
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,286
Did he join you in your
hotel room that night

743
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,906
after he left the party?

744
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,240
Yeah. He did.

745
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,220
Which is why neither one of
us could have killed Elaine.

746
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,266
Okay, so obviously we need to confirm

747
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,196
- both Nina and Eric's alibis.
- Okay.

748
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,856
Assuming they check out,
and I have a feeling they will,

749
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,476
we're gonna have to book Sam, Morgan.

750
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,896
- I'm sorry.
- No, I know.

751
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,190
But I still don't believe Sam's a killer.

752
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,456
Karadec. Sam's here.

753
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,596
I don't understand.

754
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,906
Can we please have some more time?

755
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,046
- Morgan, we talked about this.
- No, I understand that,

756
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,186
but we still haven't figured
out who that big check was for.

757
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,876
What check?

758
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,150
Elaine wrote a check made
out to cash for $45,623.

759
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,460
- Hey.
- Sam! Hey!

760
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,130
I'll talk to her.

761
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,420
$45,623.

762
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,660
That's the amount left
on my student loans.

763
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,506
Elaine wrote that check to you.

764
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,910
My god.

765
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:07,616
That means I... How is that possible?

766
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,176
- How could I...
- Just take a deep breath.

767
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,346
Okay?

768
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,720
Sam.

769
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:18,030
Sometimes really good
people do bad things.

770
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,946
My life is over.

771
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,940
- No.
- My god.

772
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,630
I'm sorry.

773
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,850
Hey.

774
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,006
I was wrong about
Sam, and you were right.

775
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,210
I just wanted to be sure you're okay.

776
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,900
Yeah. I'm okay.

777
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,280
I just really didn't want
it to be Sam, you know?

778
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,180
I wanted to protect her.

779
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,916
The truth is, when I was her age,

780
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,886
I stayed in a lot of bad situations,

781
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,056
and it wasn't 'cause I loved where I was.

782
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,570
I was just too afraid to get out.

783
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,090
I understand.

784
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,596
She got secretive, paranoid.

785
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,496
I mean, she had new
locks put on her door.

786
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,730
It felt like she had eyes
and ears everywhere.

787
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,196
- Karadec.
- Yeah.

788
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,196
We got to go back to Elaine's office.

789
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,196
We know Elaine was
secretive and paranoid,

790
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,406
so why would she hang
a mirror behind her desk?

791
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,266
Anyone coming into the
office would be able to see

792
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,406
what she was working
on in the reflection.

793
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,066
It makes no sense.

794
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:51,470
Unless it was serving
a different purpose.

795
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,036
Look.

796
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,696
If this were a real
mirror, there'd be a gap,

797
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,696
but my fingernail is
touching its reflection.

798
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,620
Because it's two-way glass.

799
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,426
With a camera hidden behind it.

800
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,706
Providing a perfect vantage
point for the entire room

801
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:09,730
and everything that happened in it.

802
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,400
Sam, we have some news.

803
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,236
Turns out there was a hidden
camera in Elaine's office.

804
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,486
We have video evidence
of the night she died.

805
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,586
You came in to tell
Elaine you were quitting.

806
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,176
And when you told her
why you were leaving,

807
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,000
she tried to bribe you to keep you quiet.

808
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,806
But you refused.

809
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,566
And you were about to go
public to the rest of the party

810
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,396
about what the kanairy
did to the jimenez family.

811
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,086
You're a fraud. I quit!

812
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:48,086
But she couldn't let
you ruin her life's work.

813
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,986
Remember you told
us Elaine was paranoid

814
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,406
leading up to the launch?

815
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,956
She tried to silence you that night.

816
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,190
But you fought her off.

817
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,650
She fell and landed
on one of her awards.

818
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,440
You hit your head.

819
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,760
And that's when you passed out.

820
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,326
So, what does this mean?

821
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,110
It means it was self-defense.

822
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,636
Sam, you responded
to a threat of bodily harm

823
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,156
with a reasonable amount of force,

824
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,630
and with a halfway decent lawyer

825
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,600
you'll serve no time.

826
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:40,176
Because all you did
was stand up for yourself.

827
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,410
Thank you.

828
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,186
We'll meet you there, lieutenant.

829
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,806
I'm gonna put $5 in the jukebox

830
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,986
- and spend it all on yacht rock.
- Do it.

831
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,600
I will so have your badge if you do that.

832
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,996
I'd ask you to join us for drinks,

833
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,616
but I'm sure you're anxious
to get back to your kids.

834
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,856
Not tonight, actually. Ludo's got them.

835
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,416
Well, then, you should definitely join us.

836
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,796
First round's on me.

837
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,206
As great as that sounds,

838
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,796
I had an evening of
doing absolutely nothing

839
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,456
that I was really looking forward to.

840
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,356
Alright. I'll see you tomorrow.

841
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,620
See you tomorrow.

842
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,940
- Good night.
- Night, Morgan.

843
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,526
She's looking at me like
I'm supposed to jump in there

844
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,876
and arrest him or something, I swear.

845
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,806
- Of course I didn't do that...
- hey!

846
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,776
- Hey!
- Morgan, you never come.

847
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,366
I figured what the hell.

848
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,196
- Let's get you a drink.
- Okay.

849
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,010
One thing...

850
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,266
What can I get you?

851
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,686
Hey, I'll have another ipa, please.

852
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,276
Manhattan, please.

853
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,966
Something you might want to know.

854
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,966
Eric bar ton and his
lawyers have promised

855
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,276
that none of the harmful kanairys

856
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,386
will make it onto shelves.

857
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:25,076
- That's great news.
- It is.

858
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,596
Also, I was texting with
Sam on the way over.

859
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,176
I told her to swing by for a drink.

860
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,386
- What?
- It's a joke, dummy.

861
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,490
- Morgan...
- Go drink your beer.

862
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,770
I'm glad you came.

863
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,056
What made you decide to come hang out

864
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,606
with your coworkers rather than

865
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,506
rather than drinking
2 1/2 glasses of wine

866
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,746
and cutting my own bangs?

867
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,896
Well, mostly, I just wanted to thank you.

868
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,306
For?

869
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,300
For being a really great boss.

870
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,516
So far, this isn't a job I want to run from,

871
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,820
and that's mainly because of you.

872
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,596
It means a lot.

873
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,526
And for the record, I wouldn't let you.

874
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,076
Hey, lieutenant.

875
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,906
Karadec said back in the day,

876
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,946
you ran over a parked
Vespa with a patrol car.

877
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,606
- Totally true.
- Okay

878
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,946
I gotta go straighten this out.

879
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,506
- Please say that's true.
- Is it?

880
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:18,546
It's not entirely true.

881
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,786
I mean, hold on, hold on...

882
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:21,840
There's more to it...
