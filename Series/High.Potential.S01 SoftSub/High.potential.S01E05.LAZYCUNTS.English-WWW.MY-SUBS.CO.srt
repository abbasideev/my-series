00:00:15,774 --> 00:00:17,189
One new message.

2
00:00:17,293 --> 00:00:19,122
Hey, Ruben. It's Dr. Monica.

3
00:00:19,147 --> 00:00:20,493
Thanks for doing overnights this week.

4
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:22,417
I'll hire another vet tech
as soon as I can.

5
00:00:22,442 --> 00:00:23,734
Sure you will.

6
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:27,174
And just a reminder: do not
turn on the overhead lighting.

7
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,030
The reptiles need 12 hours of
darkness, so you need to man up.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,136
I've lowered the dosage for Coach Romeo.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,655
He's a lot livelier now.

10
00:00:34,758 --> 00:00:36,622
Give him his meds
while he's in the tank.

11
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,211
That's everything. Talk to you tomorrow.

12
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,459
Thank you, buddy.

13
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:47,840
Okay.

14
00:00:50,395 --> 00:00:51,396
There you go.

15
00:01:08,827 --> 00:01:09,828
Romeo?

16
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:16,593
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:20,770
Romeo?

18
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,430
Buddy.

19
00:01:38,028 --> 00:01:39,478
Romeo.

20
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:43,551
Come on.

21
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:48,004
Come on.

22
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,626
It's okay. Hey.

23
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,047
Dr. Monica?

25
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:21,382
Dad's here.

26
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:23,073
Not during working hours.

27
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:24,730
During morning hours,

28
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:28,217
the LAPD is paying
Manny Ludo to watch my kids

29
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,152
because daddies do not qualify
for childcare payments, do they?

30
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:34,602
Okay, this was supposed to be
a delicious breakfast burrito,

31
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:35,707
but I ran out of tortillas.

32
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,226
So instead, it's a delicious

33
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:39,089
scrambled egg sandwich with salsa.

34
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,782
Good morning, my delightful daughter.

35
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:43,853
Good morning, darling mother.

36
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,200
- What did you just swallow?
- Orange juice.

37
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:48,488
What did you swallow
with the orange juice?

38
00:02:48,513 --> 00:02:51,205
I don't know, air? Nice boots.

39
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:53,207
Dad, now that you're a fake manny,

40
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:54,795
are you done teaching driver's ed?

41
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,047
Give up the biz? Me?

42
00:02:56,072 --> 00:02:58,626
No way. I just move
my appointments to later in the day.

43
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,111
I got two jobs now. I'm a hyphenate.

44
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:04,184
I'm a fake manny-driving
school instructor.

45
00:03:04,287 --> 00:03:06,738
Okay. Got a dead body. Gotta go.

46
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:08,774
- Stop trying to outcool me.
- Thank you.

47
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:09,869
Good. Good to see you.

48
00:03:09,894 --> 00:03:11,545
- Good luck with the dead body.
- Thank you.

49
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,853
Hi, baba.

50
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,369
Who asks someone to hold their bag
when it's covered in sticky stuff?

51
00:03:17,394 --> 00:03:19,361
The world is a disgusting place, okay?

52
00:03:19,386 --> 00:03:20,865
Those free weights at your gym

53
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,375
have about as much fecal
bacteria as a public toilet.

54
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:26,378
I am not listening to you
for the rest of the day.

55
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:28,380
- I'm trying to free you.
- What do we got?

56
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:31,625
Dr. Monica Davis, a vet
specializing in exotic animals.

57
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:33,627
Twenty-eight, single, no kids.

58
00:03:33,652 --> 00:03:34,722
Her lone employee found her body

59
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,018
when he showed up
for his overnight shift.

60
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:37,976
- Anything on this employee?
- Alibi checks out.

61
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,289
According to the ME, it looks
like a simple cardiac arrest.

62
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,430
Laser printer, however, seems
to have a different opinion.

63
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,226
That's a new one.

64
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:48,720
Why did she go through the
trouble of using the printer

65
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:50,471
to declare herself a murder victim?

66
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:52,404
There's plenty of pens
and notepads nearby.

67
00:03:52,508 --> 00:03:54,303
The ME say anything
about the blotches on her hands?

68
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:56,650
He said it looked like some kind
of allergic reaction.

69
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:58,850
But he'll run more tests once
we get the body back to his lab.

70
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,336
Here you go.

71
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:03,390
Thanks. But I have to wash these first.

72
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:07,212
Guys, he touched something that
may have touched apple juice.

73
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:09,133
We're all very concerned.

74
00:04:36,152 --> 00:04:40,203
Beware of the poisonous dart
frog. One touch can be deadly.

75
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:42,212
Karadec, wait!

76
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:45,388
Wait!

77
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,678
I said wait.

78
00:04:59,703 --> 00:05:03,414
How you doing, big fella? How
many fingers am I holding up?

79
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,235
A lot.

80
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:09,101
I had to shoot him
before he got soap on his hands.

81
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,345
I'm serious. There's a poison

82
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,347
in that soap dispenser
that would paralyze him.

83
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:15,315
That is why our victim
had to use the printer

84
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:16,833
to declare that she was murdered.

85
00:05:16,937 --> 00:05:19,560
She couldn't pick up a pen
because she was paralyzed.

86
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,201
The printer's gotta be voice-controlled.

87
00:05:21,226 --> 00:05:24,160
Printer, print "Morgan
saved Karadec's life."

88
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:25,566
On it.

89
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,947
See?

90
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:29,027
Tray one is empty.

91
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:30,606
Okay, well, if it hadn't blown its load

92
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,109
on all that "Murder" confetti,

93
00:05:32,134 --> 00:05:34,343
- that would've been very cool.
- Get back to the poison bit.

94
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:35,945
- Yes. Okay.
- Yeah.

95
00:05:36,612 --> 00:05:39,891
A frog aquarium is bolted
and locked because it is home

96
00:05:39,994 --> 00:05:42,549
to two poison dart
frogs, Wilma and Fred.

97
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:45,897
Poison dart frogs secrete
deadly toxins from their skin.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,969
Now, the bolt is there,
but the lock is loose.

99
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:51,247
More importantly,
Wilma's poisonous buddy

100
00:05:51,272 --> 00:05:52,603
is nowhere to be found.

101
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:53,774
Wait. What?

102
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:55,697
Oh, yeah. So, you got a missing frog.

103
00:05:57,978 --> 00:06:01,706
We have a hand rash, a
reaction to the batrachotoxins.

104
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:04,122
We've got a wadded up
paper towel next to the victim

105
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:08,450
because she was drying her hands
when she became paralyzed.

106
00:06:08,475 --> 00:06:09,614
So...

107
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,163
So...

108
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:13,718
Fred's in the soap dispenser.

109
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:16,306
Yep. Here's dead Fred.

110
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,757
So, do you guys think
he caught any of that,

111
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:20,310
or are you gonna
wanna fill him in later?

112
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:21,829
I think you mean, "Is he okay?"

113
00:06:21,854 --> 00:06:23,073
He's okay.

114
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:25,276
The tranquilizer was for a
snake. He's gonna be fine.

115
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,647
You're gonna be fine.

116
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:30,735
Hey, Lieutenant.

117
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,040
How's he doing?

118
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:34,617
- A tad sluggish, but...
- He's alive.

119
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,406
Good. You and Daphne
keep processing the scene.

120
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,141
When Karadec is okay to drive,

121
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,893
I need him and Morgan
to head to a salon on Grant.

122
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,128
A friend of Dr. Monica's
reported her missing last night,

123
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:46,647
a Bethany Reid.

124
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:48,408
I'm texting you the address.

125
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:49,961
Yeah.

126
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:51,963
- You guys got all that?
- I got it.

127
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:54,448
I don't think he got it. I'll drive.

128
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:02,625
How you doing over there?

129
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,701
I am still not talking to you, Morgan.

130
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:08,013
That's fair.

131
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:09,539
You did just miss a call

132
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:12,579
from someone named
Aubrey Brown-Eye Bumble.

133
00:07:12,604 --> 00:07:14,503
I'm sorry, did you answer my phone?

134
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:17,126
It was connected to your car. I
didn't want the ringing to wake you up.

135
00:07:17,954 --> 00:07:20,336
She says that Saturday at one o'clock

136
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,338
at Coast Grill sounds perfect.

137
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:24,858
I put it in your calendar for you.

138
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:26,135
Thanks.

139
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,208
How you doing? I know it kinda
doesn't seem like it right now,

140
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:33,798
but I do feel really bad
about shooting you, you know.

141
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:38,872
Morgan, I totally understand
why you did what you did.

142
00:07:39,873 --> 00:07:42,462
- If anything, I guess I wanna...
- You don't have to thank me.

143
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:43,902
I want to thank you.

144
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:45,810
Okay, go ahead.

145
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:47,397
I just thanked you.

146
00:07:47,422 --> 00:07:51,549
Well, you are welcome. You
think you can walk on your own?

147
00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:52,817
I think so.

148
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,539
Look at all these bees.

149
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:09,419
My son Gavin had a karate
tournament last night,

150
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,076
and Monica promised to be there.

151
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,561
So you called the police?

152
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:15,746
Only after I wasn't able
to reach her for hours.

153
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:18,739
It was just so unlike her not to show.

154
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:23,364
That's a quality friend. Shows
up to all your kid's stuff?

155
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:26,765
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:31,867
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No hugging.

157
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:33,927
We don't hug. We don't do hugs.

158
00:08:33,952 --> 00:08:35,187
Okay. Bethany,

159
00:08:35,212 --> 00:08:38,527
Detective Karadec would
like to ask you a few questions.

160
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,520
How did you know the veterinarian?

161
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,390
We met about two years ago
in a yoga class.

162
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,045
He's gonna need a little more.

163
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:53,809
Well, we bonded over both being
so hopelessly bad at yoga

164
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:56,328
and decided to meet
up for hikes instead.

165
00:08:56,812 --> 00:08:59,469
And our friendship just grew from there.

166
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:01,955
And it is so hard to make
female friends as an adult.

167
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:05,303
Bethany, had you noticed
anything different about Monica lately?

168
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:06,580
Actually, I did.

169
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:10,308
I went to meet Monica
for breakfast yesterday,

170
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:13,000
and she seemed distracted, nervous.

171
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:15,840
So I asked her if something was wrong,
and she just said guy troubles.

172
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:17,108
Was she dating someone?

173
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:19,455
That's what was so weird.
She never mentioned anyone.

174
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,890
Hey.

175
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:22,458
Sweetie.

176
00:09:22,483 --> 00:09:24,864
Sorry, honey.
He just really wanted his mom.

177
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:28,153
I can't believe I'm
never gonna see Monica again.

178
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:29,741
I know, sweetie.

179
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:33,297
Do you think that man hurt her?

180
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,436
Which man?

181
00:09:35,485 --> 00:09:37,038
What man, sweetheart?

182
00:09:37,063 --> 00:09:39,830
When we were at Monica's clinic
a couple of days ago,

183
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:43,341
I heard her fighting with a man,
and the man yelled at her.

184
00:09:43,928 --> 00:09:46,102
You mean the day we
brought Monica lunch?

185
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:49,485
Honey, I was there with you.
I didn't see any man.

186
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,626
He came when you went to get coffees.

187
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,939
Did you see this man
who yelled at Monica?

188
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:03,312
So, you don't know
what color eyes he had?

189
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:06,847
What about his nose?
Was it big, not big?

190
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,197
Is that an Avengers comic?

191
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:15,375
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I knew I liked you.

192
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,892
Hey, let's make a bet.

193
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,722
I bet you a lollipop of your choice

194
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:22,311
that our favorite is the same guy. Okay?

195
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:24,554
One, two, three.

196
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:25,970
- Hulk.
- Hawkeye.

197
00:10:27,074 --> 00:10:28,075
Okay.

198
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:33,529
Hey, you said the man talking to
Dr. Monica had a beard, right?

199
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:38,396
Was it a beard like Tony Stark's
or a beard like Thor's?

200
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:43,815
Tony Stark's but not as pointy,
and it was brown.

201
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,058
Okay.

202
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:49,156
Was he tall and big
or tiny like Ant-man?

203
00:10:49,994 --> 00:10:52,893
We've been estranged from our
daughter for over ten years.

204
00:10:52,997 --> 00:10:54,101
Twelve years.

205
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:57,906
You said you lived in Reseda?
Monica lived in Westwood.

206
00:10:58,002 --> 00:11:00,729
You were eight miles apart,
and you never saw each other?

207
00:11:00,754 --> 00:11:03,547
Like I said, we were estranged.

208
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:06,126
Monica drifted away after she left home.

209
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,770
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

210
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:13,362
Do you know that guy?

211
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:16,606
His name is Shane Siger. He was...

212
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,437
He was the worst thing
that ever happened to my family.

213
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,854
Monica was 16 when she
took up with him. He was 21.

214
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,960
I tried to get her to stop
seeing the creep,

215
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,902
but, you know, what can I do?

216
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:28,446
A year into their relationship,

217
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:31,104
Shane was arrested
for robbing a convenience store.

218
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:35,418
Idiot wore flip-flops, slipped
and accidentally fired his gun.

219
00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:37,766
Shot a hole into a soda display

220
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:40,147
and went to prison for armed robbery.

221
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:42,218
Moron.

222
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:44,462
Imagine what my neighbors were saying.

223
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:47,741
My teenage daughter dating a criminal.

224
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:53,264
Well, there's nothing in
his file about flip-flops,

225
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:55,300
but he did go down for armed robbery.

226
00:11:55,404 --> 00:11:57,302
Well, Shane's in
prison. He's not our guy.

227
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:03,515
Shane Siger was released
from prison last month.

228
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:12,248
I don't know, Shane.

229
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,255
I mean, we tell you that
Monica's been murdered,

230
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,110
and you don't seem at all surprised.

231
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:18,151
Or sad.

232
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:20,912
Surprise, sadness?

233
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:25,261
You guys were really expecting
a wide range of emotions, huh?

234
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,047
Monica and I broke up,
like, 12 years ago.

235
00:12:28,072 --> 00:12:30,488
Most I got for you is a "Yeah, and?"

236
00:12:30,513 --> 00:12:33,072
Yeah, and an eyewitness places
you at the clinic with Monica

237
00:12:33,097 --> 00:12:34,546
five days before her murder.

238
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,514
Now, do you have any insight
to offer us on that?

239
00:12:36,617 --> 00:12:39,310
You know, not really.

240
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:41,346
- Why were you guys fighting?
- I don't remember.

241
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,521
You have an alibi for last night, Shane?

242
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:46,973
Nothing springing to mind.

243
00:12:47,076 --> 00:12:48,181
You know what I think?

244
00:12:48,206 --> 00:12:50,641
I think you got out of prison
and wanted to pick things up

245
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,012
where you left off with Monica.

246
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,964
And she just could not
wait to say, "Hell, no."

247
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:56,267
She was educated and successful.

248
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:59,364
Pretty sure she knew she could
do better than a smug ex-con.

249
00:12:59,468 --> 00:13:02,782
Because women never go for
the bad boy, right?

250
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,509
I think maybe 48 hours in
a holding cell will help

251
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:08,891
jog Mr. Man-with-no-alibi's memory.

252
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:13,654
Ankle monitor was a condition
of my release from prison.

253
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:16,796
I'm allowed out of the house
during the day to go to work.

254
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:19,143
I'm a personal trainer down
at Muscle Beach

255
00:13:19,246 --> 00:13:21,248
if you ever wanna swing by for a sesh.

256
00:13:27,394 --> 00:13:30,515
The monitoring station
confirmed Shane's story.

257
00:13:31,741 --> 00:13:34,503
Well, he can't be a murderer
if he was at his own place all night.

258
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:35,529
We gotta cut him loose.

259
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:40,750
Do you think that there's any way
the parents could be involved?

260
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,752
The dad maybe, but did you see the mom?

261
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,557
That woman was devastated.

262
00:13:44,582 --> 00:13:46,515
Monica hadn't spoken to her parents

263
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,758
in a dozen years, grieving mom included.

264
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:50,899
Besides, my mom's threatened
to kill me hundreds of times.

265
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:52,693
Well, I've been doing this
for a little while,

266
00:13:52,718 --> 00:13:54,256
and I can tell you that filicide

267
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:55,904
is one of the rarest forms of murder.

268
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:02,600
You have time for
a quick non-work-related,

269
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,172
potentially overly-personal question?

270
00:14:04,197 --> 00:14:05,233
Nope.

271
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:07,265
- Do you ever snoop on your kids?
- No.

272
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:10,366
That was definitive.

273
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,921
It's not snooping
when a concerned mom does it.

274
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:15,785
I like to think of it
as responsible parenting.

275
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,155
Yeah.

276
00:14:19,203 --> 00:14:20,411
- Hey.
- Hey.

277
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:22,102
Chloe's still napping.

278
00:14:22,206 --> 00:14:25,381
And as suspected, avocado...
not a big hit.

279
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,530
You're home early.

280
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:28,384
Yeah. I just had to check on something.

281
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:32,078
Ava took a pill this morning.

282
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:33,458
- What kind of pill?
- I don't know.

283
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:35,968
The sneaky kind that you swallow
behind your mom's back.

284
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:37,807
Did you come home to snoop?

285
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,569
It is not snooping when
it's a concerned mom doing it.

286
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:42,064
It's called responsible parenting.

287
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,368
Morgan, stop.
Snooping is a slippery slope.

288
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:47,472
Once you invade someone's
privacy, there's no going back.

289
00:14:47,576 --> 00:14:49,992
No more communicating.
It becomes your go-to mode.

290
00:14:52,753 --> 00:14:54,686
What if she's microdosing?

291
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,274
Or she's macrodosing?

292
00:14:57,068 --> 00:14:59,174
I mean, she could be buying Adderall

293
00:14:59,277 --> 00:15:00,830
off that Shelby character.

294
00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:02,083
Nah, Shelby's gunning for Yale.

295
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:03,488
She wouldn't be selling her Adderall.

296
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:06,767
Maybe Ava just had a headache.
She could've taken an aspirin.

297
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,908
Yeah, well, you don't
hide aspirin from your...

298
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:13,448
- Oh, God. It's birth control.
- No, it's not.

299
00:15:13,473 --> 00:15:16,338
It certainly looks like all the
birth control I forgot to take.

300
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:20,333
I'm not emotionally prepared
for this. Yes, I am. I am.

301
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:23,439
Okay. Okay, here's what I'm gonna do.

302
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,875
I'm gonna sit here in the dark,
and when she walks in,

303
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,108
I'm gonna hold up the evidence,

304
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:28,858
and I'm gonna turn on
a single light bulb.

305
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,999
Or both of us forget this ever happened

306
00:15:31,102 --> 00:15:32,621
and never speak of it again.

307
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,969
No, I'm gonna do my light bulb move.

308
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:37,729
Yeah. It's okay. It's okay.

309
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:39,993
I'm in an interrogation room
half the day.

310
00:15:40,018 --> 00:15:41,605
- I can handle this.
- Or another option,

311
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,390
you do that annoying grown-up thing

312
00:15:43,494 --> 00:15:46,186
where you hold on to information
and don't do anything with it.

313
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:48,188
Let her come to you.

314
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:50,708
Once you break her trust,
you're not going to get it back.

315
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:52,365
I don't wanna break her trust,

316
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:54,712
but parenting comes
with major consequences.

317
00:15:54,815 --> 00:15:56,334
And she has a boyfriend.

318
00:15:56,438 --> 00:15:59,475
I make one wrong move, I
don't step in when I should've,

319
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:00,925
and her whole life is screwed.

320
00:16:01,408 --> 00:16:02,409
I mean, that...

321
00:16:04,308 --> 00:16:05,378
What are you guys doing?

322
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,418
We gotta talk to you about something.

323
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:17,666
We need to know if you think
your room will fit

324
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,220
one of those swinging chairs
that you love.

325
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:22,395
It totally would.

326
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:25,743
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, like, the
rattan one from Urban Outfitters

327
00:16:25,846 --> 00:16:27,400
would be so perfect for right here.

328
00:16:35,097 --> 00:16:38,687
Hey, Oz. Come check out these
reviews for Monica's clinic.

329
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:44,279
What have you got
on our veterinarian murder?

330
00:16:44,382 --> 00:16:47,178
Okay, there's something curious
about Monica's vet clinic.

331
00:16:47,282 --> 00:16:50,285
The reviews online were exceptional
up until about six months ago.

332
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,148
Then she started to receive
a string of one star reviews.

333
00:16:53,173 --> 00:16:55,782
Okay, this one guy... he
goes by the moniker Asmodeus...

334
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,947
he paints Monica out to be
some kind of monster.

335
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:59,535
A monster who needs to be stopped.

336
00:17:00,122 --> 00:17:03,367
"This so called veterinarian is
gonna pay for what she's done."

337
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,060
Track down this Asmodeus person.
Pay him a visit.

338
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,478
Do you know this woman?

339
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:14,378
Really? She sent the police?

340
00:17:14,977 --> 00:17:16,700
That chick's got some nerve.

341
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:18,313
That chick was murdered yesterday.

342
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:22,800
- Why are you talking to me?
- Glad you asked, Rodney.

343
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:24,955
We've got a couple
of threatening online reviews

344
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,879
you directed at Monica
under the name Asmodeus.

345
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:29,462
How'd you find me?

346
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:31,288
We did a reverse image search
on your profile pic.

347
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:32,587
You don't exactly blend in.

348
00:17:32,612 --> 00:17:33,889
So, what did Dr. Monica do

349
00:17:33,914 --> 00:17:35,778
to deserve all the threats and anger?

350
00:17:37,332 --> 00:17:39,023
She killed Fernanda.

351
00:17:40,404 --> 00:17:43,441
Okay, that's crazy.
I have the exact same tattoo.

352
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:45,305
Dr. Monica killed your pet spider?

353
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:47,997
Fernanda was a Peruvian
glass-haired tarantula.

354
00:17:48,022 --> 00:17:50,273
She wasn't some pet. She was my baby.

355
00:17:50,556 --> 00:17:52,938
I took Fernanda to the clinic
for a routine visit.

356
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:55,453
Dr. Monica insisted I leave her
for an exam.

357
00:17:56,972 --> 00:17:58,629
Then later, Dr. Monica called

358
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:00,838
and said that Fernanda was infectious

359
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:02,655
and needed to be incinerated.

360
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:07,534
I never even got to say goodbye.
She was my best friend.

361
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,851
But I swear... I swear I
didn't kill Dr. Monica.

362
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:15,690
I just wanted to ruin
her reputation online

363
00:18:15,715 --> 00:18:17,452
because people needed to be warned.

364
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,650
And yeah, maybe...
maybe I took it too far.

365
00:18:19,753 --> 00:18:20,961
Took it too far how?

366
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:25,621
I followed her home one night.
To scare her, that's it.

367
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:28,279
I'm guessing you're the only dude
in Brentwood with a face tat?

368
00:18:28,383 --> 00:18:31,110
I didn't follow her to Brentwood.

369
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:33,181
I followed her to an apartment
in Hollywood.

370
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:40,084
Digging those French
tips, Valorie. Very old money.

371
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:49,128
There was a Good Times Roll bag
at the murder scene.

372
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:51,475
It was delivered to Monica
at a Hollywood address.

373
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,994
But she lived by the
clinic in Brentwood.

374
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:55,055
Exactly.

375
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:59,034
So why would Monica have food
delivered to a Hollywood apartment

376
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,485
when she lived and worked
on the other side of town?

377
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,836
Daytime stakeouts are less cool.

378
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,665
I mean, I feel gross eating Swedish Fish

379
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:11,150
and Pringles while the sun's out.

380
00:19:11,253 --> 00:19:12,875
Pay attention, please.

381
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:14,670
I can chew, regret my choices

382
00:19:14,774 --> 00:19:16,569
and stare at a building
all at the same time, Daph.

383
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:18,536
Do you think Karadec stops for snacks?

384
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:22,030
I probably think about what
Karadec does a lot less than you do.

385
00:19:22,055 --> 00:19:24,351
I just have a lot of respect for him.

386
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:27,235
Morgan has such a great
learning opportunity right now.

387
00:19:27,338 --> 00:19:29,340
Here, you're the only one learning.

388
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,242
Is that a gun?

389
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:39,108
Hey! Watch the road!
What are you, crazy?

390
00:19:44,804 --> 00:19:45,805
Freeze! Police!

391
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:47,979
More cops?

392
00:19:48,635 --> 00:19:50,189
What are you guys doing he...

393
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:51,466
Did you call for backup?

394
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:53,709
You said I could call
for backup next time.

395
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:56,125
This is Larry, the building super.

396
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,462
We thought we saw him pull a weapon.

397
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,557
Did you pull a weapon, Larry?

398
00:19:58,582 --> 00:19:59,897
I just took out my drill.

399
00:19:59,922 --> 00:20:01,752
I'm supposed to fix
that busted ceiling fan.

400
00:20:01,777 --> 00:20:03,349
Larry, you dog.

401
00:20:03,374 --> 00:20:06,170
You got a holster for
your drill? I like it.

402
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,010
Didn't Morgan's text say we were
meeting the building's super?

403
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:10,278
I didn't get a text from Morgan.

404
00:20:10,303 --> 00:20:12,841
Yeah, you did. I texted
'cause Karadec was driving.

405
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:15,179
Yeah, it's right
here. Daphne Lewandowski.

406
00:20:15,204 --> 00:20:17,294
That's not you. That's not you.

407
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:19,770
In my defense, who's got
two Daphnes in her phone?

408
00:20:19,795 --> 00:20:21,523
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

409
00:20:21,548 --> 00:20:23,291
Wait, how did you find this place then?

410
00:20:23,394 --> 00:20:25,465
I checked the reviews
for Monica's clinic online.

411
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:28,019
Tracked down a disgruntled
spider owner who threatened her.

412
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:30,643
Got him to admit that he
followed her to this apartment.

413
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:32,438
- What about you?
- Morgan found a receipt

414
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,163
on the Good Times Roll
bag at the murder scene

415
00:20:34,188 --> 00:20:35,381
and the address was on it, so...

416
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:36,752
Great minds.

417
00:20:37,565 --> 00:20:42,141
Guys, you're gonna wanna check this out.

418
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,846
Hey, Oz. Come here. Is that...

419
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,815
Fernanda. That is definitely her.

420
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:09,958
What was she up to?

421
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,996
Looks like Monica Davis,
doctor of veterinary medicine,

422
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:17,966
had a secret life
as an exotic animal trafficker.

423
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:29,357
Pastel butter python, 7,500 bucks.

424
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,807
Palm cockatoo, 15,000.

425
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,227
Think I've got something.

426
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:41,369
Looks like some kind
of coded list, right?

427
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:43,609
This first line. 3912

428
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:47,142
Lamer, 2381, 9424?

429
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:49,238
Lamer could be Lemur misspelled.

430
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,551
Okay, this last part could be a price.

431
00:21:51,655 --> 00:21:53,208
Why is Monica getting into
the black market?

432
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,037
I mean, what does she need
the money for?

433
00:21:55,141 --> 00:21:56,591
She's operating a one-woman clinic.

434
00:21:56,694 --> 00:21:57,902
That can't be cheap.

435
00:21:57,927 --> 00:21:59,929
These are not codes for animal sales.

436
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:02,424
It's abbreviations for house listings.

437
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:05,116
3912 Lamer is the address.

438
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,291
Then it's square footage, lot size,

439
00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:09,258
bedrooms, bathrooms, garage size

440
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:10,915
and the date of the open house.

441
00:22:13,014 --> 00:22:16,742
Monica needed money for a house.

442
00:22:19,924 --> 00:22:20,925
Okay.

443
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,833
Daphne, I want you
to dig into the trafficking.

444
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:24,343
See if you can find
anything on the buyers.

445
00:22:24,368 --> 00:22:26,399
Oz, you get Dr. Monica's patient files.

446
00:22:26,424 --> 00:22:28,356
See if you can connect any of
these animals to the clinic.

447
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:30,797
Morgan and I are gonna go have
a little chat with Ty Williams.

448
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:32,730
She started out looking
for a home way up in Orland,

449
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:35,423
but she had a partner and it
wound up being too far for 'em.

450
00:22:35,526 --> 00:22:37,770
- Did you ever meet this partner?
- No.

451
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,772
Do you have a picture
of the property she was buying?

452
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,221
Of course.

453
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,159
Well, thanks for
coming by, Mr. Williams.

454
00:22:49,954 --> 00:22:53,130
If you're ever looking to move
out of the city, give me a call.

455
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:54,234
Okay.

456
00:22:57,548 --> 00:23:00,137
According to Bethany,
Monica said she was having guy troubles.

457
00:23:00,931 --> 00:23:01,932
Maybe it wasn't Shane.

458
00:23:01,957 --> 00:23:03,655
If there was a man in her life,
we need to find him.

459
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,046
I don't think she had a man in her life.

460
00:23:07,662 --> 00:23:08,835
Bees.

461
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:13,012
- She had a bee in her life?
- Follow the bees, Karadec.

462
00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:17,085
The garden. See how these tall
flowers are clumped together?

463
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:20,063
That is a pollinator garden,
like the one outside of the salon.

464
00:23:20,088 --> 00:23:23,332
The salon that had flowers
and bees all over the sign.

465
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,851
They're planted like that so the bees

466
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:26,405
can quickly go from flower to flower.

467
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,550
Bees are the reason

468
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:30,349
Monica originally wanted to
find a house in Orland.

469
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:32,825
It's the bee capital of California.

470
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,094
And do you see these
little pastel roofs?

471
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:37,563
Those are the top of apiaries
for beekeepers.

472
00:23:37,588 --> 00:23:41,420
Monica wanted to find a house
for the woman she loved.

473
00:23:43,663 --> 00:23:44,837
Bethany.

474
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,805
Bethany, you lied to us.

475
00:23:48,131 --> 00:23:51,890
Why don't you just head back
and Jen will get you rinsed out.

476
00:23:52,776 --> 00:23:55,123
You and Monica
may have bonded over bad yoga,

477
00:23:55,148 --> 00:23:57,577
but you were more than friends,
weren't you?

478
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:00,956
Yeah, we were.

479
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,442
Yeah. And she was
buying a house for you?

480
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:05,726
She was buying a house for us.

481
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:07,031
For the three of us, okay?

482
00:24:07,056 --> 00:24:09,689
I was leaving Nathan, and Gavin
and I were gonna move in with her.

483
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,785
A house she was purchasing
using the proceeds

484
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,123
from her illegal
animal trafficking business.

485
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:15,356
What?

486
00:24:16,006 --> 00:24:17,179
No, Monica would never...

487
00:24:17,204 --> 00:24:18,895
She was stealing
clients' animals from the clinic

488
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,301
and selling 'em on the black market.

489
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:21,607
Why would she do that?

490
00:24:21,632 --> 00:24:23,151
My guess is because she loved you.

491
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,187
We saw the brochure from the new house.

492
00:24:25,212 --> 00:24:26,593
It was a bee lover's heaven.

493
00:24:26,775 --> 00:24:28,881
Seems like she really wanted
to make you happy.

494
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:31,262
Bethany, did your husband
know about this affair?

495
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:33,859
Did he know you were
planning on taking his son away?

496
00:24:35,888 --> 00:24:36,889
Yeah.

497
00:24:36,992 --> 00:24:39,167
Nathan saw some of the text messages

498
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,651
that Monica had sent me.

499
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:44,034
He wanted to work on things,
but he knew I was leaving him.

500
00:24:45,829 --> 00:24:47,002
You don't think he...

501
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:49,557
No, Nathan would never...

502
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:57,933
I'll be with you in a minute.

503
00:24:58,186 --> 00:24:59,912
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

504
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:01,845
Mr. Reed. Thanks for coming.

505
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,779
Yeah. Sorry, I was
picking Gavin up from karate

506
00:25:04,882 --> 00:25:06,194
- when I got your call.
- Yeah.

507
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,058
You said you just had a few questions?

508
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:09,422
Yeah, it's no problem.

509
00:25:09,447 --> 00:25:11,001
Is Detective Oz here?

510
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:13,028
He's not, but I am.

511
00:25:13,132 --> 00:25:15,134
And I happen to know about

512
00:25:15,237 --> 00:25:18,517
a secret stash of gummy bears
in Detective Karadec's desk.

513
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:20,208
Don't tell him.

514
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:22,313
I'll take care of him.

515
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:24,523
- Let's go.
- Check out my new belt.

516
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,041
No way.

517
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:29,503
It is understandable you
had some anger towards Monica.

518
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,573
I really didn't.

519
00:25:30,598 --> 00:25:32,496
She was taking your wife, your family.

520
00:25:32,521 --> 00:25:34,197
Did you confront her?

521
00:25:34,222 --> 00:25:35,765
Look, I never...

522
00:25:41,401 --> 00:25:42,402
Yeah.

523
00:25:46,826 --> 00:25:48,656
You wanna tell us about this?

524
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,828
Did you really think we wouldn't find it

525
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:55,657
hidden in the bottom of your tool chest?

526
00:25:55,753 --> 00:25:58,140
Did you really think that we
wouldn't check the table of contents

527
00:25:58,165 --> 00:26:00,234
for poison dart frogs?

528
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:05,943
No response. Okay, how about this?

529
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,154
I'm guessing you're a coffee man?

530
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,377
All right, I did it.

531
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:29,829
I killed Monica.

532
00:26:37,155 --> 00:26:38,597
Everyone did some nice work.

533
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,840
It wasn't just me.
It was a... a team effort.

534
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:44,578
Friday. Time to tie
one on. Who's in, huh?

535
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,950
- Bobby, come on.
- I gotta get home.

536
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:48,330
Karadec? Morgan?

537
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:51,610
- One drink.
- Yes.

538
00:26:57,305 --> 00:26:59,548
Something's not quite
sitting right with you

539
00:26:59,573 --> 00:27:01,351
about Nathan's confession.

540
00:27:02,344 --> 00:27:04,001
Same. The pieces just aren't quite

541
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:05,589
clicking together in my brain.

542
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:08,385
Yeah, well, Nathan's wife
was leaving him for Monica.

543
00:27:08,972 --> 00:27:10,870
He did confess to the murder,
but I don't know.

544
00:27:10,974 --> 00:27:13,045
Won't hurt to look at it
with fresh eyes on Monday.

545
00:27:13,148 --> 00:27:14,425
- Monday?
- Yeah.

546
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,900
No, I can't go into
the weekend like this.

547
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,340
I won't be able
to stop thinking about it.

548
00:27:17,365 --> 00:27:19,569
And you got your big
date to distract you.

549
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:21,743
What date?

550
00:27:21,847 --> 00:27:23,331
Aubrey Brown-Eyed Bumble.

551
00:27:24,815 --> 00:27:26,886
Tomorrow at one o'clock, Coast Grill?

552
00:27:29,486 --> 00:27:32,729
You don't remember who she is?
How many dates did you arrange?

553
00:27:32,754 --> 00:27:34,929
I... I cast nets, okay?

554
00:27:35,723 --> 00:27:36,812
Morgan... Morgan,

555
00:27:36,837 --> 00:27:39,322
you have exactly one second
before I arrest you for theft.

556
00:27:39,347 --> 00:27:41,590
- Give...
- You left your interests blank?

557
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:43,662
I did. Okay? There
needs to be some discovery.

558
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:46,906
I'm a... a cipher, a man of mystery.

559
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,749
I can't give you this phone back
until I know you have interests

560
00:27:49,774 --> 00:27:52,616
other than punctuality and hygiene.

561
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,191
Thank you.

562
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,376
And I'll have you know, I have
plenty of very normal interests.

563
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:02,922
Football. You know,
history. Working out.

564
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:07,064
So you're a cover model
for Generic Bro Weekly.

565
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:09,101
I also play a lot of Scrabble.

566
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:10,619
Oh, my God. Okay, listen.

567
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:13,105
I say this as a concerned citizen, okay?

568
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,762
You gotta loosen up a little bit.

569
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,454
Have some fun.
Step out of your comfort zone.

570
00:28:17,557 --> 00:28:20,112
Morgan, in the interest of
our professional relationship,

571
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:21,769
do not say another word.

572
00:28:21,872 --> 00:28:25,255
- I'm just trying to...
- Not one more word.

573
00:28:25,358 --> 00:28:26,757
Okay.

574
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:28,568
That doesn't count.

575
00:28:29,523 --> 00:28:31,779
But while I'm at it, wear
your dark blue shirt tomorrow.

576
00:28:31,882 --> 00:28:33,677
It brings out your eyes
and makes you seem less uptight.

577
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:36,585
Also, something's off with his
timeline, so the case isn't over.

578
00:28:40,063 --> 00:28:41,823
Do you remember how Bethany said

579
00:28:41,927 --> 00:28:44,136
that she had been friends
with Monica for two years?

580
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:45,896
- Uh-huh.
- You know I found that picture

581
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,140
of Bethany and Gavin
in Monica's apartment.

582
00:28:48,243 --> 00:28:49,935
Well, Gavin had his yellow belt then.

583
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:51,626
He got his purple belt today.

584
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,802
So as you get older and better,
you test to earn new belts.

585
00:28:54,905 --> 00:28:59,254
It starts with yellow, then
orange, green, blue and purple.

586
00:28:59,358 --> 00:29:01,256
So even if Gavin went to karate
twice a week,

587
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,948
it would take him longer than two years

588
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:04,363
to go from yellow to purple belt.

589
00:29:04,388 --> 00:29:06,675
And I didn't really see
his face in the picture,

590
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,155
but he was certainly much shorter.

591
00:29:08,984 --> 00:29:12,160
So are you saying that
Monica was stalking Bethany?

592
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:14,718
Either that or Gavin
had an insane growth spurt

593
00:29:14,743 --> 00:29:16,089
and is a karate prodigy.

594
00:29:16,114 --> 00:29:18,565
Yeah, well, like I said, let's
just dive back in on Monday.

595
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:22,036
No, but my brain's
spitting ideas out now.

596
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:27,731
Why'd we stop at this Swift Mart?

597
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:29,664
It's, like, forever out of the way.

598
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,839
'Cause you two had to pee,

599
00:29:31,942 --> 00:29:34,358
and about a decade ago,
some meathead robbed this place,

600
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:35,642
so I wanted to check it out.

601
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:36,976
Whatever.

602
00:29:54,137 --> 00:29:56,656
Nobody move! This is a robbery!

603
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:07,253
What kind of idiot robs a store
wearing flip-flops?

604
00:30:08,979 --> 00:30:11,257
I told you. He's a moron.

605
00:30:12,017 --> 00:30:14,674
Hang on. How did you know
he was wearing flip-flops?

606
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,576
Hi, guys.

607
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,164
Who wants to go to the beach?

608
00:30:21,189 --> 00:30:22,741
Is there food there?

609
00:30:31,174 --> 00:30:33,555
Are we coming with you
to interview a murderer?

610
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:34,694
No.

611
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:38,052
Don't worry, sweetie. Just an
ex-con with an airtight alibi.

612
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:39,354
Good. Push.

613
00:30:41,011 --> 00:30:42,702
Okay, make yourselves comfortable.

614
00:30:42,727 --> 00:30:43,832
We'll go for tacos after.

615
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,604
Wow. One earbud, huh?

616
00:30:47,707 --> 00:30:49,468
How annoying and on-brand.

617
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:51,573
Hey, good hustle. Get out of here.

618
00:30:54,024 --> 00:30:55,025
What do you want?

619
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,969
Why didn't you tell the police
that Monica was your accomplice

620
00:30:57,994 --> 00:30:59,271
in the convenience store robbery?

621
00:30:59,296 --> 00:31:01,954
She was a minor. She would've
gotten a short sentence.

622
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,622
I know she was with you.
Her father gave details of the crime

623
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:06,856
that weren't in the police report.

624
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:08,807
Yeah, like I care what he has to say...

625
00:31:08,832 --> 00:31:10,592
I'm sorry, can you take this stupid...

626
00:31:10,617 --> 00:31:12,109
Hey, are you crazy?

627
00:31:15,218 --> 00:31:16,219
She was pregnant.

628
00:31:20,655 --> 00:31:22,407
The last three months were bananas.

629
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:23,847
I spent all my free time studying.

630
00:31:23,872 --> 00:31:26,253
But I finally got my SHRL certification.

631
00:31:26,826 --> 00:31:30,553
Congratulations. SH...
What... What is that? I'm sorry.

632
00:31:30,578 --> 00:31:32,580
Sorry. Not everyone's in HR, Aubrey.

633
00:31:33,995 --> 00:31:36,653
It's an advanced credential for
human resource professionals.

634
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:38,413
Yeah, that's... Wow.

635
00:31:40,243 --> 00:31:41,485
This burger's perfect.

636
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:43,902
Just how I like it.
Not too much stuff on it.

637
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,284
I usually only eat red meat
right before sex.

638
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:50,494
Karadec, here you are.

639
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:54,498
Oh, my God. I'm starving.
Can I please have some fries?

640
00:31:54,523 --> 00:31:55,593
Absolutely.

641
00:31:55,618 --> 00:31:58,408
She promised us tacos, but I
don't think that's happening.

642
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:00,470
- Hey.
- Do you know this woman?

643
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:01,954
Yeah, I think so.

644
00:32:01,979 --> 00:32:04,035
I'm his wife, and these are his kids.

645
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,477
And this, Adam, is not you
playing squash with your buddies.

646
00:32:07,995 --> 00:32:09,686
I thought we agreed that we were only

647
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:11,446
gonna splurge on hookers as a couple.

648
00:32:12,699 --> 00:32:15,875
I'm just messing with
you, Aubrey. I'm his partner.

649
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,143
- We're not partners.
- Nonromantic partner.

650
00:32:18,168 --> 00:32:20,258
We're not partners. She's
actually just a consultant.

651
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:22,975
We work on cases together
in a "partnerly" fashion.

652
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,296
All right? Does that work?

653
00:32:24,344 --> 00:32:26,560
And I've got a theory about
the one we're working on now.

654
00:32:26,585 --> 00:32:28,449
And boy, is it a doozy.

655
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:32,191
Bethany's son, Gavin,
is definitely adopted.

656
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,218
And I'm more than pretty sure

657
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,654
that Monica and Shane
are his biological parents.

658
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,371
- Wait, wait. How do you...
- Should I...

659
00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:41,304
So Shane and Gavin both have

660
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:43,814
preauricular sinuses, aka ear dimples.

661
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,835
Some biologists think that ear dimples

662
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,398
are a vestige of fish gills.

663
00:32:48,161 --> 00:32:49,334
- What?
- It's not important.

664
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,289
The point is, they're super rare.

665
00:32:51,314 --> 00:32:54,248
Only 0.1% of the population has them,

666
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:57,147
and it's even rarer
to have them in both ears.

667
00:32:57,251 --> 00:32:59,839
So if you do, it is 100% inherited.

668
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:04,189
So when a daddy with two
ear dimples loves a mommy,

669
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:06,570
the baby will also have two ear dimples.

670
00:33:06,674 --> 00:33:09,677
And that is exactly how
we know that Gavin

671
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,611
is Shane and Monica's biological potato.

672
00:33:13,163 --> 00:33:14,509
- Potato?
- Child.

673
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,761
Sorry, we're all hungry.

674
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:18,099
Bethany and Nathan... no dimples.

675
00:33:18,203 --> 00:33:21,206
Shane and Gavin... two dimples each.

676
00:33:21,231 --> 00:33:23,321
- I swung by and talked to Shane.
- You did what?

677
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:24,795
She talked to Shane
with the ear dimples.

678
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:26,418
He basically confessed, facially,

679
00:33:26,443 --> 00:33:27,858
that he was covering for Monica

680
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:30,535
the day of the convenience store robbery

681
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,976
because she was pregnant with his baby.

682
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:34,874
A teen pregnancy.

683
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:36,428
That's why Monica's dad
was ashamed of her.

684
00:33:36,453 --> 00:33:37,834
That's why they were estranged.

685
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:40,896
Yes. And I think
Bethany learned the truth.

686
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:43,544
She's not the person Monica
wanted to keep in her life.

687
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:46,952
It was Monica's biological son, Gavin.

688
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:53,755
Yeah, see? Look, right there.

689
00:33:53,859 --> 00:33:55,895
They're so tiny,
you have to really look closely.

690
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:58,898
I don't need to see any more
photos of ear dimples. I get it.

691
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:00,935
So now you're saying
that the husband confessed

692
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,202
to a crime he didn't commit?

693
00:34:02,227 --> 00:34:04,746
My guess is he's devoted to
his wife, trying to protect her.

694
00:34:04,771 --> 00:34:07,882
Or I'm so good, I got an
innocent man to confess.

695
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:14,569
I came as soon as I got your message.

696
00:34:14,673 --> 00:34:15,984
Is there news about my husband?

697
00:34:16,009 --> 00:34:17,754
Look, he's innocent, okay? I know it.

698
00:34:17,779 --> 00:34:19,050
Bethany, I think it's best that we

699
00:34:19,074 --> 00:34:20,526
move someplace we can talk privately.

700
00:34:20,551 --> 00:34:22,208
Detective Oz will take care of Gavin.

701
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:24,993
Bethany, what was your reaction

702
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:27,755
when you found out that Monica
wasn't really in love with you?

703
00:34:28,618 --> 00:34:30,965
Monica's parents forced
their pregnant teenage daughter

704
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,140
to give her baby up 12 years ago.

705
00:34:34,037 --> 00:34:36,764
Monica didn't just happen to
bump into you at yoga, did she?

706
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,007
No. No, she sought you out.

707
00:34:39,032 --> 00:34:41,838
She befriended you, and she
pretended to fall in love with you

708
00:34:41,941 --> 00:34:44,047
to get close to the person
that she really loved:

709
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,600
Gavin.

710
00:34:46,493 --> 00:34:49,062
And the person who loved you...
your husband, Nathan...

711
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,985
confessed to a murder
he didn't even commit.

712
00:34:51,249 --> 00:34:52,711
Now, maybe you're fine with that.

713
00:34:52,814 --> 00:34:55,679
I mean, you did sneak that
frog book into his tool box.

714
00:34:56,508 --> 00:34:58,372
But, Bethany, can you really live with

715
00:34:58,397 --> 00:34:59,796
sending an innocent man...

716
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:02,548
the man that you married... to
prison for the rest of his life?

717
00:35:05,206 --> 00:35:08,623
I destroyed my marriage for
Monica, and it was all a lie.

718
00:35:09,452 --> 00:35:11,971
That day that Gavin heard
the horrible man

719
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:14,008
arguing with Monica, I was there.

720
00:35:14,664 --> 00:35:17,218
Only I didn't know Gavin
overheard it at the time.

721
00:35:18,564 --> 00:35:20,014
And he was yelling at her

722
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,223
for giving up their son for adoption.

723
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,639
In that moment, I knew two things.

724
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:27,918
Gavin was Monica's biological child,

725
00:35:28,022 --> 00:35:30,507
and Monica seduced me to get to him.

726
00:35:31,577 --> 00:35:34,994
She was trying to steal my son!

727
00:35:37,376 --> 00:35:39,067
And it was working.

728
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:42,001
Gavin loved Monica.
They had a connection.

729
00:35:42,105 --> 00:35:44,556
He wanted to be a vet like her, and...

730
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,424
One of the reasons
why I fell in love with Monica

731
00:35:50,527 --> 00:35:53,151
was because of how amazing
she was with Gavin, and...

732
00:35:54,013 --> 00:35:56,568
and now I can't stop wondering

733
00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:59,502
if maybe it was the same for her.

734
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:03,126
That maybe it only
just started out as a lie.

735
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:05,784
Do you think...

736
00:36:11,272 --> 00:36:12,894
Have them release Nathan.

737
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:14,955
Bring that man to his son
as soon as possible.

738
00:36:18,452 --> 00:36:21,179
You... Watch out... You
gotta watch out for the red...

739
00:36:21,204 --> 00:36:22,431
- That dragon guy. You gotta...
- Yes.

740
00:36:22,456 --> 00:36:23,871
- There you go. All right.
- They're all red.

741
00:36:23,896 --> 00:36:25,434
- There's a big guy coming.
- Look, that guy.

742
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:26,805
- That was...
- Excuse me.

743
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:30,986
I got turned around. I'm here to
collect my daughter's effects.

744
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:34,364
I... Sure. I can find
someone to help with that.

745
00:36:36,124 --> 00:36:37,919
Hey, buddy.
Why don't you go get yourself

746
00:36:37,944 --> 00:36:39,739
some snacks
from the snack machine, okay?

747
00:36:39,921 --> 00:36:40,922
Come on. Go.

748
00:36:43,097 --> 00:36:44,374
Just have a seat here.

749
00:36:45,479 --> 00:36:47,135
I'll go find an
officer to help you, okay?

750
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,609
Thank you. Okay.

751
00:36:52,555 --> 00:36:54,246
Hey. You seen Hoffy?

752
00:36:54,902 --> 00:36:57,215
No, but Bethany confessed.

753
00:36:58,077 --> 00:37:00,804
She found out that Monica
was Gavin's biological mother.

754
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:03,484
She thought Monica
was stealing her son from her.

755
00:37:09,015 --> 00:37:11,021
I'm... I'm so sorry to bother you again.

756
00:37:11,046 --> 00:37:12,722
I just wanted to let you know

757
00:37:12,747 --> 00:37:14,508
that I'm gonna come back tomorrow.

758
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:16,726
- I'm not up for it tonight.
- Okay.

759
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:18,753
- No problem. Whatever works.
- Okay.

760
00:37:20,514 --> 00:37:24,207
Hey, Oz. Could you bring
Nathan up from holding?

761
00:37:25,415 --> 00:37:26,623
- Yep.
- Thank you.

762
00:37:30,696 --> 00:37:32,111
I'm sorry I jumped the gun.

763
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:37,759
What I don't get is why you confessed
to a crime you didn't commit.

764
00:37:39,222 --> 00:37:40,603
I grew up without a mom.

765
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:43,433
It was hard.

766
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:47,368
I didn't want that for my son.

767
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:54,375
Me? I wouldn't have wanted
to grow up without my dad.

768
00:38:02,556 --> 00:38:05,628
This sucks. Doesn't feel like we won.

769
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:06,732
Yeah.

770
00:38:08,147 --> 00:38:10,149
Hate to tell you,
but it's like that a lot.

771
00:38:13,532 --> 00:38:15,258
Here you go, sweetheart. Try that.

772
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:22,161
Finally. Thank you.

773
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:24,371
Well, the bill was just too wrinkled.

774
00:38:24,474 --> 00:38:26,476
That's why the machine
kept spitting it out.

775
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:31,516
What did you get?

776
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:33,276
Sour Cherry Tsunamis.

777
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:36,244
My daughter used to love sour candy.

778
00:38:41,422 --> 00:38:42,941
- Gavin.
- Dad!

779
00:38:43,044 --> 00:38:44,183
Hey, bud.

780
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:47,739
Oh, man.

781
00:38:49,292 --> 00:38:50,293
You all right?

782
00:38:50,845 --> 00:38:51,846
Let's go.

783
00:39:50,457 --> 00:39:51,803
Be with you in a minute.

784
00:39:51,906 --> 00:39:54,322
I don't think your friend here
is that patient.

785
00:39:57,256 --> 00:39:58,257
Fernanda?

786
00:40:00,294 --> 00:40:01,364
Fernanda!

787
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,583
You're awake.

788
00:40:13,687 --> 00:40:15,585
It's not even noon
though. Is everything...

789
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,485
- Are you feeling okay?
- What are you doing?

790
00:40:19,486 --> 00:40:20,970
Brought you some mango juice.

791
00:40:21,073 --> 00:40:22,143
Thanks.

792
00:40:22,696 --> 00:40:25,526
You know this room service thing
is kinda sus, right?

793
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:28,771
Yeah.

794
00:40:29,288 --> 00:40:30,531
I did something really awful,

795
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:32,750
and I'm scared that you're
not gonna forgive me for it.

796
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:34,639
Did you shrink my Lululemons?

797
00:40:34,742 --> 00:40:36,118
No.

798
00:40:39,126 --> 00:40:41,439
I snooped in your room
and I found your birth control.

799
00:40:43,246 --> 00:40:45,866
I saw you being stealthy
and swallow a pill,

800
00:40:45,891 --> 00:40:47,617
and my mind just
kinda ran wild. And I...

801
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,792
I should've asked you.

802
00:40:50,689 --> 00:40:52,532
- Can't believe you did that.
- I know.

803
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,005
I want you to trust me, and
then I didn't trust you. And...

804
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:59,836
I just... I messed up.
And that's why I'm coming clean.

805
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:03,461
But it kills me that you thought
you had to hide that from me.

806
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:05,393
I knew you'd freak out.

807
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:07,223
Yeah, I'm gonna freak out.

808
00:41:07,326 --> 00:41:08,845
And then I'm gonna pull it together

809
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:10,709
and come to my senses
and have your back.

810
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:13,505
- Always.
- I know.

811
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:15,334
I'm serious.

812
00:41:15,438 --> 00:41:16,543
I'm your ride or die.

813
00:41:16,646 --> 00:41:19,891
Your bury the bodies
and ask questions later.

814
00:41:19,994 --> 00:41:21,340
I know, Mom.

815
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:24,171
I'm sorry.

816
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:27,899
I should've just told you.

817
00:41:28,002 --> 00:41:29,901
And I was going to,
but it just seemed stupid.

818
00:41:30,004 --> 00:41:31,661
No, it's not stupid. I get it.

819
00:41:32,179 --> 00:41:35,044
My skin just got so bad,
and you just kept telling me,

820
00:41:35,147 --> 00:41:37,495
"Oh, you look so pretty."
And, "No one will notice."

821
00:41:38,774 --> 00:41:39,911
What?

822
00:41:40,014 --> 00:41:42,672
My skin. My whitehead situation.

823
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,054
Jennifer J. started taking birth control

824
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:46,513
and her acne is, like, gone.

825
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:49,437
So I saved up all my babysitting
money, and I went online and...

826
00:41:49,462 --> 00:41:52,016
Wait, you went on birth control
for your complexion?

827
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,283
Yeah.

828
00:41:55,443 --> 00:41:57,480
Wow. Okay, good. I...

829
00:41:59,482 --> 00:42:01,010
But you see how cool
and supportive I was

830
00:42:01,035 --> 00:42:02,278
when I thought you were having sex?

831
00:42:02,303 --> 00:42:03,368
- That's...
- Well, no.

832
00:42:03,393 --> 00:42:06,352
I am having sex, but that's
not why I got the birth control.

833
00:42:08,146 --> 00:42:11,770
Yeah. Yeah. And that's
something that we can t...

834
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:12,953
- What?
- My gosh.

835
00:42:12,978 --> 00:42:14,324
Mom, you're so easy.

836
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:17,248
I hate you. What... I hate you.
Don't laugh at me.

837
00:42:17,273 --> 00:42:18,417
- No!
- I'll beat you

838
00:42:18,442 --> 00:42:20,133
with your own birth control pillow.

839
00:42:20,158 --> 00:42:22,229
- Mom, stop. That's... Get out.
- I'm so mad at you.

840
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:23,402
You're grounded!
