1
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:46,073
Listen, can you mail this for me today?

2
00:00:46,178 --> 00:00:47,941
Sure, Whitman.

3
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:51,243
It's going to be at least 40 cents.

4
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:57,755
Thank you.

5
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,918
Mama, Mrs. Winter is a busybody.

6
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:34,754
You're threatening me.

7
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:37,786
I'm glad he wants to see me,

8
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:41,559
but I... I don't want to see him.

9
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,761
I'm working a lot right now.
I don't have a lot of time.

10
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:47,837
I have to go.

11
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:52,342
Were you listening to my phone call?

12
00:01:52,444 --> 00:01:54,708
You mean your personal phone call?

13
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:57,982
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

14
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,108
Peggy, will you get me
a glass of ice water?

15
00:02:00,218 --> 00:02:02,049
Someone hasn't told
the sun it's October.

16
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:03,815
- Miss Holloway.
- Mr. Draper,

17
00:02:03,922 --> 00:02:05,355
it's the Clients' Luncheon.

18
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:06,981
Mr. Cooper said
you were responsible

19
00:02:07,092 --> 00:02:08,753
while Mr. Sterling is out.

20
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,488
Didn't you handle most of Mr. Sterling's
catering questions?

21
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:12,790
Continue doing that.

22
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:14,388
How is he? Have you visited?

23
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:17,366
I have. He's less sickly.

24
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:21,530
I hope he knows
how concerned we all are.

25
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,642
- Good morning, chief.
- Don.

26
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:28,937
Joan's been a bitch lately.

27
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:30,378
Anyone else notice that?

28
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:31,414
Oh, absolutely.

29
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:33,040
- I like it.
- Oh, do you?

30
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:40,923
This got kicked over
from Ed Baltz at Compton.

31
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:44,757
We sent them Firestone last month
because of our conflict with Goodyear.

32
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:46,592
This is how they repaid the favor.

33
00:02:46,698 --> 00:02:47,960
Look at that.

34
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:50,159
I think it's a modified Lionel transformer.

35
00:02:50,268 --> 00:02:53,294
Well, I never thought I'd say this,
but what does the research say?

36
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:55,566
Weight loss is a hard thing to prove.

37
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:58,700
No, it isn't. It's "before"
and "after" pictures

38
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,573
since the dawn of time.

39
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:03,910
Mr. Martin Buckwald, its inventor,
he calls it the P.E.R.,

40
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:05,983
or Passive Exercise Regime.

41
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:08,848
So it needs a name.

42
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:14,456
The Electrocizer.

43
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:17,153
For a slimmer, better you.

44
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:18,820
That helps a little.

45
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,329
Regarding slimmer,

46
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:22,400
Buckwald has a fair amount of testimonials,

47
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:25,368
but unfortunately
none you can take a picture of.

48
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,335
We tried to get our own testimonials.

49
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,373
Some of the fellas brought
it home to their wives.

50
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:30,532
And?

51
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:33,167
It's tricky. I, uh, gave it to Jennifer.

52
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:34,643
She took it the wrong way.

53
00:03:34,746 --> 00:03:36,236
She told me to wear it.

54
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,444
Violet has it.

55
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:41,519
She says the scales are the same,

56
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,078
but she hasn't given up on it
like she does with diets after a week.

57
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,090
Mitch and some of the other guys...

58
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:48,682
We had eight belts.

59
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:50,659
Again, there's been no weight loss yet.

60
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:52,161
Who cares if it works?

61
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:53,595
They're offering us
commission on media,

62
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:56,462
plus a bounty on every unit
upside of last year's comps.

63
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:58,365
But fake weight loss claims?

64
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:04,809
Thank you.

65
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:13,143
What about her?

66
00:04:13,251 --> 00:04:16,948
She's obviously losing
some kind of battle.

67
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:19,683
You may have to let it out a little.

68
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,622
Maybe you should
put her on your regimen

69
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:24,251
of sprinting out the door
every day at 5 to 5.

70
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:27,627
What I'm saying is she did
a heck of a job on Belle Jolie.

71
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:29,666
Maybe lightning will strike twice.

72
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:32,100
I don't think Peggy's the answer.

73
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:35,736
I promised Buckwald
we'd go with our big guns.

74
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:39,436
Our big guns have been silent.

75
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:40,533
Peggy!

76
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:44,976
Did you need more water?

77
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:49,784
This device is a new product.

78
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:52,755
I would like you
to give us your thoughts on it.

79
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:54,621
Right now?

80
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:55,693
No.

81
00:04:56,995 --> 00:04:59,862
It's a weight loss belt, it says.

82
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:04,868
It, uh, stimulates the muscles,
imitating calisthenics.

83
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,562
You'd be perfect for it.

84
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:08,662
Why?

85
00:05:08,773 --> 00:05:10,866
Because you're a woman.

86
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:13,240
And we'd like your point of view.

87
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,913
I'm getting another account?

88
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:20,178
It's an assignment, not an account.

89
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,819
Go ahead, sweetheart.
Take it for a spin.

90
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:33,862
Uh, am I allowed to change the name?

91
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,699
Yes.

92
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:38,200
Thank you.

93
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:40,704
That'll be all.

94
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:48,809
I need 3.59 for the phone bill.

95
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:50,541
I told you I never use it.

96
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:53,982
But you do use the saltines
and the Velveeta and the liverwurst.

97
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:55,245
I never even got any.

98
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:56,251
I had some people over

99
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:58,754
while you were out drinking on Tuesday.

100
00:05:58,857 --> 00:06:01,223
3.59. That's your half of the phone.

101
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:03,021
You should use it more.

102
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:04,857
I have work to do.

103
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:07,591
I don't know why you do that.

104
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,326
When I leave the office, I'm done.

105
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:58,402
Do you have to go home?

106
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:01,206
No.

107
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:04,372
Good. I don't want you to.

108
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:08,081
I don't want to.

109
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:16,493
This is hard for me.

110
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,931
Mostly because I can't even imagine
how hard it must be for you.

111
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:26,330
I don't think about it.

112
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,200
I mean, I try not to.

113
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:35,542
Must be a powerful mind you have there,
because I can't control mine.

114
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:41,750
I keep thinking about us being together.

115
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:43,081
We are together.

116
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:44,985
I know, but...

117
00:08:48,793 --> 00:08:52,422
I don't know if I understand
how this works,

118
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,259
where it goes.

119
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:57,960
I'm worried it's a fantasy.

120
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:01,568
It's not.

121
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:08,270
I told you, I'm right
where I'm supposed to be.

122
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:22,484
I just haven't figured out
what to do yet.

123
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:40,506
I'm sorry. Would you
like me to wait outside?

124
00:09:40,612 --> 00:09:42,807
It's up to you.

125
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:46,372
I, um, I did the work
on the weight loss belt,

126
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:47,576
like you asked.

127
00:09:47,685 --> 00:09:48,743
That was fast.

128
00:09:48,853 --> 00:09:50,821
You asked me to.

129
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:53,152
And what is your unique point of view?

130
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:55,283
I wrote it down.

131
00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:58,594
Summarize.

132
00:09:58,696 --> 00:10:01,290
It's one day. I don't know
if I lost any weight.

133
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,764
Do you feel different?

134
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:05,961
I wrote it down.

135
00:10:13,611 --> 00:10:16,205
Peggy, you're saying
even less in here than you are now.

136
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:19,846
It's hard to put into words.

137
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:21,919
Then you have failed.

138
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:26,249
You definitely feel something

139
00:10:26,357 --> 00:10:30,555
that I think some women...
would like to feel.

140
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,021
Where is that here?

141
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:38,826
It vibrates.

142
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:44,202
And that coincides
with how you wear it.

143
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:51,140
Oh. I see that here:

144
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:52,716
"A sensation. "

145
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:54,148
Yes.

146
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:56,550
It explains its success.

147
00:10:56,654 --> 00:10:58,383
And it basically made me think

148
00:10:58,489 --> 00:11:02,084
it was probably...
unrelated to weight loss.

149
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:04,388
We now have a benefit.

150
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:06,554
And we just have to figure out
how to put it into words.

151
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:07,995
Have another go at it.

152
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:09,828
I will work on that, Mr. Draper.

153
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:15,772
Peggy, just think about it deeply.

154
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:17,466
Then forget it,

155
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:21,944
and an idea will... jump up in your face.

156
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:25,281
Thank you.

157
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:37,119
Excuse me, ma'am.

158
00:11:37,228 --> 00:11:38,525
I hate to bother you.

159
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,621
I'm from the Frederick
Air Conditioning Company,

160
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:42,324
and I'd like to talk to you

161
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:44,560
about an opportunity
to live in frozen comfort.

162
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:46,364
I'm not interested.

163
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:49,201
Could I trouble you for a glass of water?

164
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:51,400
It's a scorcher out here.

165
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:54,710
L...

166
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:56,905
Of course.

167
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:58,505
Thank you.

168
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,239
Thank you.

169
00:12:29,347 --> 00:12:34,512
You know, we have many units
in all price ranges.

170
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:35,813
What?

171
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:39,021
I'm married to a salesman.

172
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:43,787
And I'm sure my husband and I
can brave another week

173
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:46,420
or however long
this Indian summer's going to be.

174
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:48,692
Can I come back when he is here?

175
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,634
I mean, a unit here
or in your living room...

176
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:54,568
We wouldn't
even have to alter your window.

177
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:56,731
We could just cut a hole right above it.

178
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:58,900
You see this gap?

179
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,570
That's where your cool air,
whatever there is of it,

180
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,907
is escaping.

181
00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:04,504
From that little space?

182
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:08,312
Yes. And there's a science
to how heat patterns work.

183
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:11,650
Now, what you need is
a unit here downstairs

184
00:13:11,756 --> 00:13:12,916
and one in your bedroom.

185
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:16,221
That's if you have the right construction.

186
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:18,761
That would be nice.

187
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:21,354
I could take down some numbers,

188
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:22,899
you know, measure everything.

189
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:24,935
Write up an estimate...

190
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:26,833
something you could
discuss with your husband

191
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:28,667
when he comes home.

192
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:31,139
I guess that would be okay.

193
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:50,455
You know...

194
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:53,189
my husband...

195
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:55,765
I think he would rather go to Sears.

196
00:13:57,135 --> 00:13:58,932
If that's what you want.

197
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:00,766
You should go.

198
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:04,865
I can just guess what this would cost
and put it on your door for your husband.

199
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:06,341
Please go.

200
00:14:22,593 --> 00:14:26,893
Fernando, we are pleased to hear
that case sales have more than doubled.

201
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:29,967
We still believe that most of the credit
goes to your rum.

202
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:32,036
Say hello from me.

203
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:35,731
Bert Cooper says it is a unique pleasure
working with you.

204
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,573
I just finished trying
to talk Lucky Strike off a ledge.

205
00:14:40,678 --> 00:14:41,975
Junior or Senior?

206
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,911
Senior. He's coming for lunch tomorrow

207
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:46,449
to see if Roger is still involved.

208
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:48,917
And they're having this lunch
bedside, I suppose?

209
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,114
I invited him here to see for himself.

210
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:55,090
He called my bluff.

211
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:57,559
Clear tomorrow.

212
00:14:57,662 --> 00:15:00,153
I need you to, uh,

213
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:02,732
draw focus from our guest of honor.

214
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,604
...was number 2 in his class
at Columbia Law School.

215
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:10,298
He works with Morgenthau,

216
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:13,900
and having been captivated by him
at more than one cocktail party,

217
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:15,410
he is a charmer.

218
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:17,344
I can see he does something for you,

219
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:19,746
but I don't know if this is the right time.

220
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:21,876
Because you're getting
so much younger every day?

221
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:24,477
Because I don't know
if my heart would be in it.

222
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,285
Are you seeing that goy?

223
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:30,720
A little bit.

224
00:15:30,828 --> 00:15:34,195
Well, I told you
I wouldn't let that stop me.

225
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:36,357
What if he were, um...

226
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:38,196
You're mumbling.

227
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:42,072
What if he were married?

228
00:15:42,173 --> 00:15:44,664
My goodness.

229
00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:47,401
Jesus.

230
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:49,571
Nothing's happened.

231
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,908
Good.

232
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:55,675
But I have been thinking about it.

233
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:57,913
The two of us together.

234
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:03,016
It feels so natural. I feel so close to him.

235
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:04,788
Really?

236
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:07,262
He's married, but I don't think he's happy.

237
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:08,855
Obviously.

238
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:13,331
What does it matter?
Nothing's going to happen.

239
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:15,337
All I know is what I see in the movies.

240
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:19,170
It's magical, and then they start talking
about him leaving his wife,

241
00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:20,710
and then he doesn't.

242
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:23,006
I saw this one where the husband
gets the woman pregnant

243
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:24,274
so he kills her.

244
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:25,906
You don't want to be that woman.

245
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:31,718
Go ahead.

246
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:40,222
Oh, please. Whatever it says
is going to seem related to this.

247
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:42,424
"You are your own worst enemy. "

248
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:45,124
That's yours.

249
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:59,045
You look tired.

250
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,811
I am.

251
00:17:02,286 --> 00:17:04,447
You're working too much.

252
00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:08,719
No, it's just...

253
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:13,687
Maybe.

254
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:21,967
It's too hot in here anyway.

255
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:36,010
You know, we're losing a lot of our cool air
through the windows in the dining room?

256
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:40,088
What?

257
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:43,024
Nothing. It's just something
the salesman said.

258
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:46,154
What was he doing
in the dining room?

259
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:48,960
What are you talking about?

260
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:53,570
You let a stranger in my house?

261
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:54,695
Don't raise your voice.

262
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:56,568
I damn well will raise my voice.

263
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:58,869
Do you have any idea
what could have happened?

264
00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:01,342
I could have bought an air conditioner.

265
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:03,072
It's hot.

266
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,910
Salesmen go into people's
homes every day.

267
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:09,418
It's like when you
turn on a television set

268
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,647
and then you turn it off, it...

269
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:13,587
Look, you didn't want
to spend the money...

270
00:18:13,691 --> 00:18:14,988
Good night, Betty.

271
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:37,213
I feel like I should make a speech.

272
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:40,507
Get back to work.

273
00:18:42,953 --> 00:18:44,648
Welcome back. You look good.

274
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,587
Honey.

275
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:49,990
One hour. That's all you get.

276
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:53,992
You be a good boy.

277
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,034
I shall be both dog and pony.

278
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:00,103
Come on.

279
00:19:04,508 --> 00:19:05,907
He looks like death.

280
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:10,037
I know. His hair and his skin
are the same color.

281
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:11,739
Not really.

282
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:19,952
That's the spot...
exactly where it happened.

283
00:19:20,057 --> 00:19:21,786
I can still feel it.

284
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:34,770
Miss Holloway, we brought you here
because of your discretion.

285
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:38,069
Can you help us with this? His color?

286
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,634
Hey, honey.

287
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,141
Well, you know,
we don't need Miami Beach,

288
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:47,149
but, uh, just do what you can do.

289
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,925
Can I kiss you?

290
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:03,499
I don't know if I could handle it.

291
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:24,611
We should have done this
for Nixon before the debates.

292
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:27,156
Oh, the arrogance of that campaign.

293
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:29,158
It's infuriating.

294
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,091
Being the incumbent is even harder.

295
00:20:31,195 --> 00:20:33,789
You can't just sit on your ass
and look presidential.

296
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:35,331
You probably shouldn't get so upset.

297
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:37,060
It's not good for you.

298
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:39,568
I missed you.

299
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,103
You know that, right?

300
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:45,271
I missed you, too.

301
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:49,335
Oh, Joannie, Joannie,
look at that mouth.

302
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:53,012
You're not doing my lips.

303
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:55,142
My rouge is too dark,

304
00:20:55,252 --> 00:20:57,880
but I have this light lipstick.

305
00:20:57,988 --> 00:21:00,923
You'll draw freckles on me, too,
like Raggedy Andy?

306
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:07,029
Look, I want to tell you something

307
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:08,894
because you're very dear to me,

308
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:11,297
and I hope you understand
it comes from the bottom

309
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:14,303
of my... damaged, damaged heart.

310
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:22,913
You are the finest piece of ass I ever had,

311
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:25,982
and I don't care who knows it.

312
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,575
I am so glad I got to roam those hillsides.

313
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:30,654
Stop it.

314
00:21:30,754 --> 00:21:32,381
I mean it.

315
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,889
I've had a lot of time

316
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:37,620
to think about the things I've done
and been sorry about,

317
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:39,696
and being with you is not one of them.

318
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,361
Oh, Red.

319
00:21:52,142 --> 00:21:54,201
That's not what I wanted.

320
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:58,210
You look better.

321
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:18,962
I should have come over.

322
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:20,832
That's a silly idea.

323
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:22,200
Damn it.

324
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:25,742
Soon the milk stains
are going to meet the sweat stains.

325
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:32,072
Should we get out of here and let her sleep?

326
00:22:32,182 --> 00:22:35,117
I'd love to, but the door's
noisier than our talking.

327
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:37,744
She's actually
a good sleeper, thank God,

328
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:40,221
even with the heat rash.

329
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:41,723
Poor thing.

330
00:22:41,825 --> 00:22:44,521
And it actually gets hotter at night.

331
00:22:46,196 --> 00:22:48,096
Did you think about
buying an air conditioner

332
00:22:48,198 --> 00:22:49,722
from that pushy young man yesterday?

333
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,301
Is that what he was selling?

334
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:57,363
He looked like one
of Carlton's squash buddies.

335
00:22:57,474 --> 00:22:59,374
Made me sorry I answered the door.

336
00:22:59,476 --> 00:23:02,036
He was very pushy.

337
00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:05,274
He came in and started measuring things.

338
00:23:05,382 --> 00:23:07,350
Don was not happy about that.

339
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:08,418
Don was there?

340
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,781
No.

341
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,759
Carlton would break my arm.

342
00:23:17,595 --> 00:23:19,995
It was foolish letting him in.

343
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:29,830
Why would you tell him?

344
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,573
It just came up.

345
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:39,173
I wasn't thinking.

346
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:40,580
What did he do?

347
00:23:40,684 --> 00:23:42,242
What do you think?

348
00:23:42,353 --> 00:23:44,150
He lost his temper.

349
00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:49,048
He's very protective.

350
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:56,293
Just as you requested,
a little of our local color:

351
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,664
Pastrami, cole slaw, sour pickles.

352
00:23:59,837 --> 00:24:01,168
I like it.

353
00:24:01,271 --> 00:24:02,795
It's Yankee barbecue.

354
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:06,572
Yeah.

355
00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:11,513
They're all ours.

356
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:15,950
Here they are now.

357
00:24:16,053 --> 00:24:17,520
- Roger.
- Hello, Lee.

358
00:24:17,621 --> 00:24:19,452
- Hello, Don.
- Lee.

359
00:24:19,556 --> 00:24:22,957
Jimmy, Preston, how do you do?

360
00:24:24,194 --> 00:24:25,855
It's wonderful to see you.

361
00:24:25,963 --> 00:24:27,487
Well, from what I hear,

362
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:29,793
you boys had all but
given me up for dead.

363
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,992
I don't think it's wrong

364
00:24:31,101 --> 00:24:34,468
for us to express our concern
for your well-being.

365
00:24:34,571 --> 00:24:38,803
Well, I know how much
you love your delicatessen.

366
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:42,140
But I know
there's also something else

367
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:43,838
you want to discuss.

368
00:24:43,947 --> 00:24:46,381
You're worried about losing the lawsuit?

369
00:24:46,483 --> 00:24:48,280
There were no damages.

370
00:24:48,385 --> 00:24:49,647
But we lost.

371
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:50,845
But there were no damages.

372
00:24:50,954 --> 00:24:53,548
Blame is one thing, malice is another.

373
00:24:53,657 --> 00:24:57,457
I worked my way inside
and out of the FTC.

374
00:24:57,561 --> 00:25:01,190
Bought a lot of dinners in Washington.

375
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:03,027
You can't fight them.

376
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:05,033
That's what lawyers are for.

377
00:25:05,135 --> 00:25:09,071
Lawyers? I've seen
a girl fight harder on her first date

378
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:11,141
than these DC shuttlecocks.

379
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:15,503
Listen, I'm a stockholder,

380
00:25:15,612 --> 00:25:18,046
so I called Chester Conrad
in the Surgeon General's office,

381
00:25:18,148 --> 00:25:20,582
and he assured me it would
be at least three years

382
00:25:20,684 --> 00:25:21,946
before they could compile a report.

383
00:25:22,052 --> 00:25:24,020
But legislation is in progress.

384
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:25,952
We hear another year or two beyond that.

385
00:25:26,056 --> 00:25:28,581
They speculate they're going to put
warning signs on the packages.

386
00:25:28,692 --> 00:25:31,456
There's still plenty of time
before we have to worry about that,

387
00:25:31,562 --> 00:25:34,588
during which we wait
to see if share drops off

388
00:25:34,698 --> 00:25:37,496
before we run for the hills
looking for a new campaign.

389
00:25:38,902 --> 00:25:39,994
Is that true?

390
00:25:40,104 --> 00:25:42,937
Well, it must be. He just said it.

391
00:25:44,475 --> 00:25:46,966
Well, I've been spending
a lot of time with my wife.

392
00:25:49,646 --> 00:25:51,671
I'm glad we came by.

393
00:25:51,782 --> 00:25:54,148
I missed you all.

394
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:55,980
You New Yorkers.

395
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:00,155
To New Yorkers.

396
00:26:00,257 --> 00:26:01,554
May they always...

397
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,357
Oh, Jesus. Not again.

398
00:26:05,462 --> 00:26:07,760
Are you okay?

399
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:10,163
Just give him some air.
Give him some air.

400
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:11,427
Give him air.

401
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,068
- I'm okay.
- Don't talk.

402
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:22,645
This was stupid. I'll get the elevator.

403
00:26:22,746 --> 00:26:25,010
No, they're holding the elevator.

404
00:26:27,284 --> 00:26:28,683
I'm very sorry.

405
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,026
Mona, sweetheart, this was a mistake.

406
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,122
I tried to talk him
out of it, but you people.

407
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:45,827
Mrs. Sterling, I had no idea.

408
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:50,100
I used to think you couldn't
put a value on a human life,

409
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:52,334
but I never asked Bert Cooper, did I?

410
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:53,568
Sweetheart...

411
00:26:53,677 --> 00:26:55,076
Go to hell, Bert.

412
00:27:03,854 --> 00:27:07,085
I don't need to tell you that Don
has everything under control.

413
00:27:07,191 --> 00:27:08,954
I don't know.

414
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:10,856
Without Sterling...

415
00:27:10,961 --> 00:27:12,826
I may have a family business,

416
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,727
but I'm not an autocrat.

417
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:17,096
I have a board,

418
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:22,400
and my son wants to be the executive
of an aluminum company.

419
00:27:22,506 --> 00:27:28,240
Ah, still, your board
should give credit where credit is due.

420
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:30,040
Share?

421
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:33,173
We all like Don Draper,

422
00:27:33,283 --> 00:27:36,252
but if I was you,
I'd find some way to show him

423
00:27:36,353 --> 00:27:39,186
that you all do, too.

424
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:41,553
He's a dead man, you know,
even if he survives.

425
00:27:41,658 --> 00:27:42,750
What are you talking about?

426
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,351
Most clients will put up
with one coronary from a partner.

427
00:27:45,462 --> 00:27:47,225
Cost of doing business. Two?

428
00:27:47,331 --> 00:27:48,923
Are we going down?

429
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:51,899
I wrote, prepared,
and sent out my resume this afternoon,

430
00:27:52,002 --> 00:27:53,936
at company expense.

431
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:56,801
Look, it doesn't take a genius
to see what's going to happen.

432
00:27:56,907 --> 00:27:58,204
They'll bump Draper up to partner.

433
00:27:58,308 --> 00:27:59,400
Everyone will fall in line.

434
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:00,635
Draper.

435
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:02,575
It would have happened a long time ago

436
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:03,771
if they weren't so greedy.

437
00:28:03,881 --> 00:28:05,439
They're already paying him
his weight in gold.

438
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:07,107
Half the accounts
at this agency came for Draper.

439
00:28:07,217 --> 00:28:09,583
Frank Birmingham brings in
a lot of accounts.

440
00:28:09,686 --> 00:28:11,517
Come on. You sit
in that conference room.

441
00:28:11,622 --> 00:28:12,884
Frank Birmingham brings them in,

442
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,514
and while they're dozing off,

443
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:15,990
Don goes through their wallets.

444
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:18,550
What about Mitch Sullivan in Media?

445
00:28:18,662 --> 00:28:21,153
He's fat, bald, and charmless.

446
00:28:21,265 --> 00:28:24,063
You think Draper likes me?

447
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:25,896
He rides me pretty hard sometimes.

448
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:27,436
It's hard to tell with him.

449
00:28:27,537 --> 00:28:28,561
He likes you.

450
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:29,798
I work at it.

451
00:28:29,907 --> 00:28:30,999
I work at it, too.

452
00:28:31,108 --> 00:28:32,200
I can tell you do.

453
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:33,867
You never know when he's doing it.

454
00:28:35,412 --> 00:28:36,970
There's not a man in this room

455
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,911
who's not holding Don Draper
on their shoulders

456
00:28:39,016 --> 00:28:40,449
so that he can reach partner.

457
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,575
He's not going to fire you.

458
00:28:42,686 --> 00:28:44,119
Who said anything about that?

459
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:45,620
No one. It's just...

460
00:28:45,722 --> 00:28:47,747
You don't think he deserves it, do you?

461
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:50,827
Campbell, don't you
know anything about business,

462
00:28:50,928 --> 00:28:52,486
cleaning out the old guys?

463
00:28:52,596 --> 00:28:55,030
It's good for us. It opens up spots.

464
00:28:57,701 --> 00:29:00,465
My ma, she wouldn't shut up about you.

465
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,299
I told her I remembered you.

466
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:04,340
Isn't that nice?

467
00:29:07,477 --> 00:29:08,808
You smoke.

468
00:29:08,912 --> 00:29:10,004
All the time.

469
00:29:10,113 --> 00:29:13,105
It's practically mandatory in our office.

470
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,514
Thank you.

471
00:29:24,027 --> 00:29:28,396
<i>Brandy Alexander for La Donna,
and a Rheingold.</i>

472
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:36,563
What, you don't like it? I'll send it back.

473
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:38,732
Well, my friend Joan
always orders them for me.

474
00:29:38,842 --> 00:29:40,503
They're usually sweeter.

475
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:45,579
She's a scream.

476
00:29:45,682 --> 00:29:48,116
She lives in the city.

477
00:29:50,988 --> 00:29:54,253
There's a bar in Manhattan
where the glasses are chilled.

478
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,027
What's in that?

479
00:29:58,128 --> 00:29:59,493
I don't know.

480
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:07,062
So you drive a truck.

481
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,365
Yes.

482
00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:11,441
But I bought my own route.

483
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:13,700
Wise potato chips.

484
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,334
Really?

485
00:30:15,445 --> 00:30:16,810
Yeah.

486
00:30:16,913 --> 00:30:20,076
I have an area that's just mine.

487
00:30:20,183 --> 00:30:24,176
The route was expensive,
but the hard part was learning that truck.

488
00:30:24,287 --> 00:30:25,982
Special license.

489
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:27,750
We have a potato chip account:

490
00:30:27,858 --> 00:30:28,950
Utz.

491
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:30,993
You get free ones? I do.

492
00:30:31,094 --> 00:30:33,187
I don't know. I don't like potato chips.

493
00:30:34,765 --> 00:30:36,289
You live out here, right?

494
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,198
Prospect Park.
I have my own apartment.

495
00:30:39,302 --> 00:30:42,135
Well, I share it
with my roommate Marjorie.

496
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:43,866
She's a character.

497
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,546
My sister's a secretary
for Bulova in Flushing.

498
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:58,015
I just got a new account the other day.

499
00:30:58,121 --> 00:31:00,715
I already wrote copy
for Belle Jolie lipsticks.

500
00:31:00,824 --> 00:31:02,883
It's going to be in a bunch of magazines.

501
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:04,119
Which ones?

502
00:31:04,227 --> 00:31:05,558
I don't think you read them.

503
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:06,856
They're about high fashion.

504
00:31:08,498 --> 00:31:10,830
Advertising doesn't work on me.

505
00:31:10,934 --> 00:31:15,166
It's just a lot of people screaming at you
from the walls and the TV.

506
00:31:15,272 --> 00:31:18,173
If advertising is good,
people never think it works.

507
00:31:18,275 --> 00:31:19,606
How do they know it does?

508
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:21,142
Did they ever prove that?

509
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:24,843
Why are you insulting what I do?

510
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:28,044
"So you drive a truck. "

511
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:31,046
You do.

512
00:31:31,154 --> 00:31:32,849
I'm my own boss, you know?

513
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:35,254
You get off the train
every day at Grand Central,

514
00:31:35,358 --> 00:31:36,689
and they spray you with gold?

515
00:31:36,793 --> 00:31:40,854
Let me tell you,
you can act like you're from Manhattan,

516
00:31:40,964 --> 00:31:43,262
but you don't look like those girls.

517
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,800
Hey, hold on.

518
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:56,708
That wasn't nice.

519
00:31:56,813 --> 00:31:58,007
I feel sorry for you.

520
00:31:58,115 --> 00:31:59,412
I said I'm sorry.

521
00:32:03,153 --> 00:32:06,213
Those people? In Manhattan?

522
00:32:06,323 --> 00:32:08,985
They are better than us,

523
00:32:09,092 --> 00:32:11,686
because they want things
they haven't seen.

524
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:17,932
<i>The Danny Thomas Show</i>

525
00:32:18,034 --> 00:32:21,629
<i>was brought to you
tonight by Post cereals.</i>

526
00:32:21,738 --> 00:32:24,866
<i>All fine products of General Foods.</i>

527
00:32:24,975 --> 00:32:26,533
<i>Post cereals.</i>

528
00:32:26,643 --> 00:32:28,508
<i>And now...</i>

529
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:35,346
I'll be up.
I want to check on Roger.

530
00:32:35,452 --> 00:32:37,147
Okay.

531
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,856
<i>Hello.</i>

532
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:50,455
Hello. It's Don Draper.

533
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:52,501
What can I do for you?

534
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:54,536
I don't know
what you do for anybody.

535
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:57,106
Mr. Draper, you sound hostile.

536
00:32:57,207 --> 00:32:58,504
<i>After hundreds of dollars,</i>

537
00:32:58,608 --> 00:33:01,577
all you've managed to do
is make her more unhappy.

538
00:33:01,678 --> 00:33:04,909
I understand this is frustrating for you.

539
00:33:05,015 --> 00:33:07,609
This has nothing to do with me. It's her.

540
00:33:07,717 --> 00:33:10,015
You took a woman
with a bad case of nerves,

541
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,418
and you made her weaker, not stronger.

542
00:33:13,857 --> 00:33:15,586
I'm afraid to leave her alone.

543
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:20,561
All I can say is that it's a process,
and time is part of it.

544
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:21,995
If you'd like to expedite things,

545
00:33:22,098 --> 00:33:23,588
we can put her in psychoanalysis.

546
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,997
What are you doing now?

547
00:33:25,101 --> 00:33:27,126
<i>Psychoanalytic psychotherapy.</i>

548
00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:32,140
<i>Psychoanalysis would mean a minimum
of three sessions a week and optimally five.</i>

549
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,434
Thank you.

550
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:37,410
I'll think about that.

551
00:33:48,825 --> 00:33:51,089
Over there.

552
00:33:51,194 --> 00:33:52,593
There's no chair.

553
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:03,729
I really wish I could have
come in and prepared first.

554
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,808
Sorry. This is the way it works.

555
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:07,467
Of course.

556
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,812
I only have one and a carbon.

557
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:15,316
That's all I had time to do.
You'll have to share.

558
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:17,386
Come on. Just give it to one of the girls.

559
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,220
Ready when you are.

560
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:31,731
Women lose weight so they'll
feel good about themselves:

561
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:35,862
Healthier, more attractive.

562
00:34:35,972 --> 00:34:37,439
Rejuvenate has a Latin root

563
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,703
which literally means "the return of youth. "

564
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:44,940
The Rejuvenator
gives you the flush and glow

565
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:48,074
not only that you might have
after hours of exercise

566
00:34:48,184 --> 00:34:50,584
but certainly as a young girl.

567
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:55,590
Isn't it nice to feel that way
whenever you want?

568
00:34:55,692 --> 00:34:58,160
Combined with a sensible diet,

569
00:34:58,261 --> 00:35:00,252
The Rejuvenator.

570
00:35:00,363 --> 00:35:02,854
You'll love the way it makes you feel.

571
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:11,633
Look, I'm not going to wait
to see how Don lands on this.

572
00:35:11,741 --> 00:35:13,299
I'm going to tell you it's good.

573
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,878
Nice end run around the weight loss.

574
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:18,846
I think it's good, too.
But what does it do?

575
00:35:25,188 --> 00:35:26,553
From what I understand,

576
00:35:26,656 --> 00:35:30,387
it provides the pleasure of a man
without the man.

577
00:35:31,661 --> 00:35:33,788
We've been replaced?

578
00:35:33,897 --> 00:35:36,263
That's why Mitch's wife
didn't want to take it off.

579
00:35:38,902 --> 00:35:40,597
Oh, I'd love to see her in that.

580
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:42,433
Oof, she's already so hot to trot.

581
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:44,598
4th of July, that gingham halter

582
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:46,039
with the knot at the bottom?

583
00:35:46,142 --> 00:35:47,473
She was falling out of it.

584
00:35:47,577 --> 00:35:48,976
Jayne Mansfield.

585
00:35:50,347 --> 00:35:52,542
Mitch's wife is very attractive.

586
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:55,083
Oh, I... I don't know her.

587
00:35:55,185 --> 00:35:57,278
First of all, no Latin.

588
00:35:57,387 --> 00:35:59,082
You sound like a valedictorian.

589
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:01,453
And the name still isn't right.

590
00:36:01,558 --> 00:36:06,393
Lastly, you still might need to give us
a hint at what it does.

591
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:10,156
I could be more explicit.

592
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:14,532
I was thinking of calling it stimulating.

593
00:36:14,637 --> 00:36:16,400
I think you need, like, a code word,

594
00:36:16,506 --> 00:36:19,373
uh, like... I don't know.

595
00:36:19,476 --> 00:36:20,773
Like refreshing.

596
00:36:20,877 --> 00:36:22,572
I'll think about that.

597
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:25,239
Oh, my God. Freddie,
doesn't your wife have one?

598
00:36:25,348 --> 00:36:27,543
What's your point, Ken?

599
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,210
My point is, didn't you say she loved it?

600
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,947
That's funny.

601
00:36:32,055 --> 00:36:34,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

602
00:36:34,357 --> 00:36:37,986
Freddie, Sal,
you know what to do here.

603
00:36:38,094 --> 00:36:40,460
I'll get arrested just doing the layouts.

604
00:36:41,931 --> 00:36:43,523
Now...

605
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:45,260
that wasn't so bad.

606
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,437
Looks like everybody liked it.

607
00:36:53,476 --> 00:36:55,137
I can tell.

608
00:36:57,213 --> 00:37:00,649
Uh, Freddie's wife does not look like Mitch's,

609
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,411
you know.

610
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:06,645
Good work, Pegs.

611
00:38:49,325 --> 00:38:50,883
Come in.

612
00:38:53,363 --> 00:38:56,821
Mr. Draper, I don't want to seem ungrateful,

613
00:38:56,933 --> 00:39:00,198
but I think I could serve Sterling Cooper
and you better as a copywriter

614
00:39:00,303 --> 00:39:01,600
if I had my own desk.

615
00:39:01,704 --> 00:39:03,296
You have a desk.

616
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:07,272
But now I have radio spots.

617
00:39:07,377 --> 00:39:12,314
Peggy, the conversation of a raise
is not inappropriate at this moment,

618
00:39:12,415 --> 00:39:13,882
but do not be timid.

619
00:39:13,983 --> 00:39:17,714
You presented like a man.
Now act like one.

620
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,880
I want $5.00 a week more.

621
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,515
Jesus, what do you make?

622
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:25,787
$35 a week.

623
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:28,989
Well, that's a 15% kick.

624
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:33,393
Don, a word.

625
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,071
Cooper and Draper just
went into Sterling's office.

626
00:39:46,182 --> 00:39:47,649
Tell me when they
come out of there, will you?

627
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,651
Sure. I'll just sit here and watch the door.

628
00:39:50,753 --> 00:39:52,084
That's all I'll do.

629
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:54,019
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

630
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:04,764
Is he dead?

631
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:06,334
No. Quite the opposite.

632
00:40:06,436 --> 00:40:08,495
They let him go home to convalesce.

633
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:10,197
And?

634
00:40:11,474 --> 00:40:13,533
I want to make you a partner.

635
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,982
As a symbolic gesture,
I think telling me that in here is in bad taste.

636
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:23,644
That's the way it works.
Roger knows that.

637
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:25,948
I'm not adding your name
to the masthead.

638
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:28,922
I'm restoring faith to our clients.

639
00:40:29,025 --> 00:40:31,323
I accept.

640
00:40:31,427 --> 00:40:33,156
I'll start you at 12%

641
00:40:33,262 --> 00:40:35,093
and see how both you and Roger do.

642
00:40:35,198 --> 00:40:37,132
Of course you'll remain creative director,

643
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:41,294
and to fill the position
of head of account services,

644
00:40:41,404 --> 00:40:44,202
you are the only member
of the blue ribbon committee.

645
00:40:44,307 --> 00:40:46,935
Do I hire from inside or outside?

646
00:40:47,043 --> 00:40:51,343
I just made you partner.
Do I have to do everything?

647
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:53,210
No contract.

648
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,017
Of course you'd say that.

649
00:40:59,122 --> 00:41:01,852
Beware the nonconformist.

650
00:41:04,627 --> 00:41:09,564
I'm going to introduce you
to Miss Ayn Rand.

651
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:11,600
I think she'll salivate.

652
00:41:25,748 --> 00:41:27,409
Is he dead?

653
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:29,907
No.

654
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:31,611
So when's he coming back?

655
00:41:34,724 --> 00:41:37,249
You know, I think this office
is too big for me.

656
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,124
I might need it if I'm going
to lure in Marty Brennen

657
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:41,423
as head of account services.

658
00:41:41,531 --> 00:41:44,500
Then it's true. Congratulations.

659
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,397
- Thank you.
- I mean it.

660
00:41:47,437 --> 00:41:48,734
You know I admire your work.

661
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:50,362
I believe you.

662
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:52,168
I hope you do.

663
00:41:52,275 --> 00:41:56,041
And I don't think it can be denied
that we make a very good team.

664
00:41:59,148 --> 00:42:00,740
You know what?

665
00:42:02,118 --> 00:42:03,847
I do like this office.

666
00:42:03,953 --> 00:42:06,012
I think Roger would want me to have it.

667
00:42:06,122 --> 00:42:08,386
That way he'll always know
he can have it back.

668
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:11,756
I hope you're aware that I'd love
to throw my hat in the ring.

669
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:15,092
I am now.

670
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:34,146
Peggy, we have both had very good days.

671
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,115
You may leave your post.

672
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:38,551
It's 4:30.

673
00:42:38,654 --> 00:42:40,986
I'm sorry. That's the best
I can do at this point.

674
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,422
I have work to do.

675
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,060
You can have your raise.

676
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:49,927
And I'll talk to Miss Holloway
about getting somebody on your desk

677
00:42:50,032 --> 00:42:51,693
while you attend to your assignment.

678
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:54,567
Can I tell her?

679
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,069
Sure.

680
00:42:56,172 --> 00:42:58,436
In the meantime, go with your friends.

681
00:42:58,541 --> 00:42:59,667
Celebrate.

682
00:42:59,776 --> 00:43:02,108
Good night, Mr. Draper.

683
00:43:17,293 --> 00:43:18,419
Good night.

684
00:44:12,248 --> 00:44:13,510
Mr. Draper?

685
00:44:18,287 --> 00:44:19,345
Good night.

686
00:44:47,683 --> 00:44:49,014
Back away from the set.

687
00:44:49,118 --> 00:44:51,916
Come on. You'll burn your eyes out.

688
00:44:52,021 --> 00:44:53,613
Hi, Daddy.

689
00:44:55,758 --> 00:44:57,316
Uh, I would have made you dinner,

690
00:44:57,426 --> 00:45:00,623
but I called the office,
and no one answered.

691
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,254
Should I fix something?

692
00:45:02,365 --> 00:45:04,890
No. I was supposed to have
a meeting with a client,

693
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:06,366
but it got cancelled.

694
00:45:16,312 --> 00:45:18,576
I got made partner.

695
00:45:18,681 --> 00:45:21,946
Oh, my God. Don, that's wonderful.

696
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:30,490
Don, you were right
about letting people in the house.

697
00:45:30,593 --> 00:45:32,060
I'm so sorry.

698
00:45:35,331 --> 00:45:37,356
I don't want to talk about that.

699
00:45:47,443 --> 00:45:50,139
The heat's supposed to break tomorrow.

700
00:45:50,246 --> 00:45:53,147
It'll probably be snowing in two weeks.
