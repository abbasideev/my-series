1
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:48,871
Hey. Dick?

2
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:52,176
Richard Whitman?

3
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:55,453
Holy smokes, is that you?

4
00:00:56,622 --> 00:00:58,556
As I live and breathe.

5
00:00:58,657 --> 00:00:59,715
It's me. Larry.

6
00:01:01,126 --> 00:01:03,560
Krisinski, L. Fort Sill?

7
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:07,393
Oh, of course. Larry, look at you.

8
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:09,228
Yeah, and you.

9
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,132
Still haven't filled out.
You must be a bachelor.

10
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,603
No.

11
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,765
Where are you at?
I'm out of Waltham, Mass.

12
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:19,606
I'm just spending a day in Armonk
with International Business Machines.

13
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:20,736
I'm upstate.

14
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:22,677
Hey, I just saw Jerry Creighton.

15
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:24,612
Remember? Slept with a sidearm in his bunk.

16
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,446
Almost blew his jaw off?

17
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:29,146
Yeah, I remember that.

18
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,621
Yeah, well... Look, I should, uh...

19
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,624
Call me. We should catch up.

20
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,319
Absolutely.

21
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:37,656
Old Dick Whitman.

22
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:40,129
What are the chances?

23
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:09,217
Good morning, Hollis.

24
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:11,558
I mean, it's France.
What do they want with the bomb?

25
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:12,961
We must have given it to them.

26
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:14,999
No way the frogs
came up with it on their own.

27
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,727
- Hey, it's the honeymoon kid.
- Hey.

28
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:19,326
Here comes Romeo
without his roe, like a dried herring.

29
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:20,530
Do I seem different?

30
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,231
You do look depleted, Humps.

31
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:23,239
The wedding was great.

32
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:24,604
How was the rest of it?

33
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,234
You're talking about my wife here.

34
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:28,279
Oh, she's already got you there?

35
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,438
Gentlemen never discuss this.

36
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:31,209
We're talking about you here:

37
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,877
The man who told us
the coat check girl from "21"

38
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:36,318
had tangerine panties.

39
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,447
Come on, buddy boy, spill.

40
00:02:38,557 --> 00:02:40,548
I don't know.

41
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:42,923
Something happened in the ceremony.

42
00:02:43,028 --> 00:02:46,589
It's when he said that thing
about being new baptized.

43
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,293
I just felt this calm come over me.

44
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:52,063
So what you're saying is,
uh, a lot of missionary?

45
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,541
Fine.

46
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:02,170
So she's laying there, right?

47
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:03,839
And she kept looking at the maps,

48
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:07,282
talking about all the things
we were going to do...

49
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:09,013
but we never did.

50
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:11,021
<i>Ladies Home Journal.
I can get that at Mom's.</i>

51
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:12,351
Welcome back, Mr. Campbell.

52
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,392
Well, hey, there.

53
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:16,688
The ring, it's like catnip.

54
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:20,925
Did you know that 600,000 gallons of water
go over the Falls per second?

55
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,000
Per second!

56
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,728
Oh, look. He's back.

57
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,201
Good morning.

58
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:27,738
- Congratulations.
- Welcome back.

59
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,432
Thanks, everybody.

60
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,940
When did this place get so friendly?

61
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:32,135
I guess people missed you.

62
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:34,075
- Welcome back, Mr. Campbell.
- Hildy.

63
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:39,843
Close the door!

64
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:41,852
Close the door!

65
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:46,185
Who put the Chinamen in my office?

66
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:48,657
Welcome back.

67
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:59,927
They paid an Oriental family
to be in Mr. Campbell's office.

68
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,973
Someone will finally
be working in there.

69
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:13,412
Mr. Romano, Mr. Kinsey, and Mr. Crane
are here for your meeting.

70
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:17,353
Do you need a minute?

71
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:18,946
Do you need a minute? You must.

72
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,583
You keep moving the Secor laxative
discussion.

73
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:26,931
See what we did to Campbell's office?

74
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,731
What do we have?

75
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:33,937
Let me remind you, safe and reliable
would make me doze off

76
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:37,372
if I wasn't so blighted
by the scourge of constipation.

77
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:40,274
Well, what can I say? I'm blocked.

78
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:42,745
I told you he wouldn't
think that was funny.

79
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:44,110
I got one.

80
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:47,014
How 'bout "Secor. It's satisfeculant"?

81
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,950
Stay in the art department, Sal.

82
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:52,922
I'm just saying we can be funny,
like those Volkswagen people.

83
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,253
You see this yet?

84
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,417
I have.

85
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:57,461
I don't know what I hate about it the most,

86
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,689
the ad or the car.

87
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:00,162
You know, they did one last year.

88
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:01,960
Same kind of smirk.
Remember "Think small"?

89
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:04,092
It was a half-page ad in a full-page buy.

90
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,465
You could barely see the product.

91
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,629
I don't get it.

92
00:05:06,738 --> 00:05:08,262
Elvis just got back from West Germany.

93
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:10,170
Why not put him in it?

94
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:11,537
They must be getting results.

95
00:05:11,643 --> 00:05:14,077
They keep going back to the well.

96
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:16,238
I want the Chinamen
out of the building by lunch.

97
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:17,781
I'm still waiting on my shirts.

98
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:20,678
You've seen this?

99
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:37,027
- I'm back now.
- I see that.

100
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,363
So...

101
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:42,531
I should be on the list for the meeting.

102
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:44,438
Oh, I just...

103
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:46,272
I didn't know when
you were coming back.

104
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:47,470
Right.

105
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:51,576
Yeah, well, it's today. Here I am.

106
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:55,382
They're all in there already. You can go in.

107
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:00,881
Peggy...

108
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:07,294
When I came over that night,

109
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,629
you know, before.

110
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:10,861
I was there.

111
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,370
You know...

112
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:16,065
I'm married now.

113
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,234
I know.

114
00:06:18,343 --> 00:06:19,742
So...

115
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,680
Pete...

116
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:29,015
I understand.

117
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:30,281
It never happened.

118
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:34,555
You want me to buzz you in?

119
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,254
The door looks a little bit open.

120
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:46,333
Sorry about that.
I took the Chinese out of the building.

121
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:47,996
But I have a feeling in an hour

122
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:49,664
I'm gonna want
to take them out again.

123
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:55,604
Bernbach. He's a Jew.

124
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:59,013
If I were him, I wouldn't want
to help reindustrialize Germany.

125
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:00,516
Everybody's got a price.

126
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:01,984
Oh, yeah, I saw that.

127
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,611
Honesty. It's a great angle.

128
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:06,623
No chrome, no horsepower,

129
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:08,818
foreign, ugly.

130
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:10,155
Guess they went with their strengths.

131
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:12,389
- It is funny.
- It is?

132
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:13,691
'Cause I think the joke's on us.

133
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:16,825
You're supposed to look at that
and say it's a great car, not a great ad.

134
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:18,368
I laughed. I think it's brilliant.

135
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,801
Brilliant.

136
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:23,204
I'll tell you what brilliance
in advertising is: 99 cents.

137
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:24,468
Somebody thought of that, Campbell.

138
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:26,874
Well, say what you want. Love it or hate it,

139
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:30,380
the fact remains we've been talking
about this for the last 15 minutes.

140
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,941
<i>And this is Playboy.</i>

141
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,713
Of course, what we should have
been talking about is Secor laxative,

142
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:42,157
unless, as it appears,
there is nothing to say.

143
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,559
I don't want to hear this.

144
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:46,096
We're on the case.

145
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:49,395
Part of this job is doing things
you don't want to do.

146
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:50,627
Most of it.

147
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,775
It's good to be back, Draper.
I missed you.

148
00:07:57,876 --> 00:08:00,140
Then it must not have been
much of a honeymoon.

149
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:05,576
I'm sorry. Welcome back.

150
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:07,777
How's married life?

151
00:08:07,886 --> 00:08:09,376
It's pretty swell.

152
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:15,192
I was raised that men don't wear jewelry.

153
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:18,127
I kind of like it.

154
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,822
Trudy's a lot funnier than I thought.

155
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:22,263
I'm actually looking forward
to going home tonight.

156
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,426
Well, I look forward to meeting her.

157
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:27,569
Hey, maybe one of these nights

158
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,437
we could get dinner together
with the, uh, wives.

159
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:31,668
Maybe we can.

160
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:51,461
You know, girls, we'd be happy
to bring you coffee.

161
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:53,053
I was on my way over anyways.

162
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,360
I have something of yours.

163
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:59,029
<i>Lady Chatterley's Lover.
I finished it last night.</i>

164
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:01,503
Good to the last drop, right?

165
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:03,631
Well, I can see why it got banned.

166
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:05,642
Well, you don't have to be so shy about it.

167
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:07,041
It's literature.

168
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:08,510
That is a huge pocketbook, Joan.

169
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:11,810
Well, it's got a change of clothing
and a toothbrush in it.

170
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,384
A hope chest.

171
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:15,385
Have you read this, Peggy?

172
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:18,547
I don't think that's a good idea.

173
00:09:18,657 --> 00:09:23,458
There's, um... this word in it a lot.

174
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:24,790
I know the word, Joan.

175
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:26,329
Well, it's sad, really,

176
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:28,797
because even with its reputation,
men won't read it.

177
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,231
And they really should.

178
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:31,825
I don't care if it's 500 years old.

179
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:34,838
It's another testimony to how
most people think marriage is a joke.

180
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,635
They rip a lot of clothing.

181
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,073
Yeah, it's a fantasy.

182
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:40,406
He's married, and she's married.

183
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:42,776
The desperate passion
of the forbidden.

184
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:44,405
Can I borrow it?

185
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:46,541
She's making it sound better than it is.

186
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:48,278
There's a few good parts, that's all.

187
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,651
And the book just opens
to those pages by itself.

188
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:54,489
Hey, don't read it on the train.

189
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:56,026
It'll attract the wrong element.

190
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:58,353
- Bye.
- Bye.

191
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,597
So the doctor says to him,
"I hope you're happy.

192
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:07,262
"While you were out
finishing a round of golf,

193
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:09,033
"your wife was in a horrible accident.

194
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,972
"She is gonna need 'round-the-clock care.

195
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:12,907
Bathing, toilet. "

196
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:14,740
Then the doc looks at him and says,

197
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:15,870
"I'm just kidding. She's dead.

198
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:17,243
Hey, what'd you shoot?"

199
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:18,976
...initial research report

200
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:22,019
and what I think are some very astute
market observations.

201
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:26,318
Mr. Draper.

202
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:29,189
Pleased to see you didn't disappear
the minute you cashed my check.

203
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:31,421
We appreciate your business.

204
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,929
Kenny, of course, you know.

205
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:35,226
Harry Crane, media.

206
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,166
And Mr. George Pelham over here,
who is from research,

207
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,329
and who has more degrees
than a Russian protractor.

208
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,066
That's quite an introduction.

209
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,233
From the other side of the pond, I see.

210
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:46,003
We take his word for it.

211
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:51,815
So, uh, that is yours to keep.

212
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:56,149
But if you'd like to follow along,
you'll see from the overview

213
00:10:56,254 --> 00:11:00,623
our primary focus was Saks,
Henri Bendel, and Bonwit Teller.

214
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:03,489
Our research uncovered
a variety of options

215
00:11:03,595 --> 00:11:07,031
they utilize to attract
your desired customers.

216
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:11,432
One thing these stores have in common
is a comfortable shopping environment.

217
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:13,834
Spacious, open sales floors,

218
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,703
An almost conspicuous lack of clutter.

219
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:18,173
Merchandise is minimal

220
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:22,679
and neatly presented on tables
and in display cases.

221
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:27,844
This "less is more" philosophy
is also evident in the window displays.

222
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:31,855
For example,
only one sweater to a window,

223
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:35,290
as opposed to windows
stuffed with merchandise.

224
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:37,224
My father's going to love that.

225
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,729
Believe it or not,
it even applies to the mannequins.

226
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:41,560
Bendel's takes the heads off theirs

227
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,930
so the shopper can imagine them
to be anyone.

228
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:45,525
Anyone without a head.

229
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:47,502
Along with these cosmetic changes,

230
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:52,168
you'll also need to provide
what we call boutique extras.

231
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:53,471
A personal shopping service,

232
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:54,977
private fashion shows,

233
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,513
and designer collections.

234
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,378
This is comprehensive.

235
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:00,314
It's the lay of the land.

236
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:03,979
Just from holding it, I feel more informed
about my competitors than ever.

237
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:09,390
And yet my store already has
a personal shopping service

238
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:11,826
and designer collections,

239
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,330
which makes me wonder
if you were so focused on my competitors

240
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:16,525
that you failed to visit my store.

241
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,101
I've been away on my honeymoon.

242
00:12:20,205 --> 00:12:21,604
I've been there a few times.

243
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:24,698
It's a beautiful old place.

244
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:31,005
Miss Menken, I can assure you

245
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:35,519
that no one at this table
has ever been to your store.

246
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,783
A wrong I will personally correct
this afternoon.

247
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:44,191
It's right on 5th Avenue.

248
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:48,232
That's one big block over
and a dozen little blocks up.

249
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:51,634
It's been there for 30 years.

250
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:53,363
- I'll walk you out.
- I've got it.

251
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,309
Harry.

252
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,674
What?

253
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:05,808
It was nice
the way you handled that.

254
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:07,851
It's hard to get caught in a lie.

255
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,443
Well, it wasn't a lie.

256
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:11,818
It was ineptitude
with insufficient cover.

257
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:16,585
Something about the way
you talk always restores my confidence.

258
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,458
I have a deep voice.

259
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:20,224
This afternoon, then.

260
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,163
It's a date.

261
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,035
New junior exec.

262
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:37,404
Changing her store
could take six months...

263
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:39,847
or a year, if I know what's good for me.

264
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:41,748
- What was that in there?
- What?

265
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:44,048
Don and Molly Goldberg.
Did you see that?

266
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:45,645
Yeah, I caught it. What's your point?

267
00:13:45,757 --> 00:13:47,622
I don't know. I mean,
everybody always jokes about it,

268
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,990
but I've never seen Draper
really turn that switch on before.

269
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,393
I guess he likes her. What would you do?

270
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,159
Trying to quit.

271
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:02,296
You are really putting the junior
in junior executive.

272
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:04,705
Look, you're married now, all right?

273
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:08,074
I'm a part of that club, too.
Two very happy years.

274
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,647
But when I'm out in the world...

275
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,614
I don't know. I don't do it much.

276
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:13,843
I'm not good at it...

277
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:15,715
The flirting, the double entendres...

278
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,515
You mean something on the side?

279
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:21,922
No. I mean enjoying
the company of women

280
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,961
in the limited way a married man can.

281
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,161
It's all we have, really.

282
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:29,529
I can't speak for everyone,
but it's plenty for me.

283
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:31,602
Same. I guess on some level,

284
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:33,534
I always thought Draper
was the same way.

285
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:35,071
Draper?

286
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:36,333
Who knows anything about that guy.

287
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:37,999
No one's ever lifted that rock.

288
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:40,839
He could be Batman for all we know.

289
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:44,108
Mr. Campbell,
you wife's on the phone.

290
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:46,149
There's bird shit on the couch.

291
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:47,650
That was priceless.

292
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,651
Hello, honey.

293
00:14:50,755 --> 00:14:52,620
Dinner? Wow.

294
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:54,988
What do I want for dinner?

295
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:56,890
I don't know.

296
00:14:56,995 --> 00:14:59,555
Anything but chicken.

297
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:00,790
Yes, they missed me.

298
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,426
Uh, rib eye in the pan with butter.

299
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,436
Ice cream.

300
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,096
I love you, too.

301
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:14,071
There's going to be dinner
waiting for me when I get home.

302
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,044
Yeah. How about that?

303
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:46,704
Mr. Kurland was mitigating a skirmish
in our housewares section.

304
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:48,642
Why do I hire young girls?

305
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,181
Because they cost practically nothing.

306
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:53,113
Costume change.

307
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,708
This is my closet.

308
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:01,518
The original tenants laid the last brick
the day before the crash.

309
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:03,491
Boy, were they in for a surprise.

310
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:09,856
As I hope you know by now,
our original store was just off 7th Avenue.

311
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:11,435
It was just hosiery.

312
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:13,800
Then they started pulling piecework
from sweatshops.

313
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:17,170
By 1932, these people had failed.

314
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:20,608
My father and uncle
picked this place up for a shekel.

315
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:23,112
Well, it is crowded.

316
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:25,478
But that might have
something to do with the sale,

317
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,949
which means that, if we're successful,

318
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,576
you're gonna lose
the customers you have

319
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:31,450
in order to get
the customers you want.

320
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:33,421
I was gonna start with raising prices.

321
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,390
Can you imagine what my father said?

322
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:37,256
Well, you do have
to give them something

323
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:38,727
for their higher dollar count.

324
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,789
It's just awfully hard to define what that is.

325
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:49,636
How may I help you?

326
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:52,403
I make them say that.

327
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,978
Carol, can we see this tray right here?

328
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:05,016
Sea horses,

329
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:06,249
crowns,

330
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:07,585
lucky dice.

331
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:10,854
Medieval knights.

332
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:23,440
That's better.

333
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,633
Thank you.

334
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:33,781
Let's take a look at the second floor.

335
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,892
We're known for our service.

336
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:46,554
That's gotta be a tough job.

337
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:48,791
I know.

338
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,733
I've always liked how quiet it is up here.

339
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:54,532
Well, that might explain the lack of customers.

340
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:59,404
I can see the charm, but...

341
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,445
the room is too dark, too old-fashioned.

342
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:03,878
The products look old.

343
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,244
But the people look wonderful.

344
00:18:07,151 --> 00:18:09,676
It's a shame we're gonna
have to lop their heads off.

345
00:18:09,787 --> 00:18:12,051
It'll ruin your favorite part of the store.

346
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:14,283
It's not my favorite part, actually.

347
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,072
The grand lot of us are going to Lansky's.

348
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:33,803
Can you believe it?

349
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,312
Have a swell time. I've got plans.

350
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,278
You look nice.

351
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,192
Hell.

352
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,031
Manhattan at your feet.
I can see the appeal.

353
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:00,627
The view's okay.

354
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:04,435
Now, this is my favorite part of the store.

355
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,337
Hey there, Missy.

356
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:10,444
Hey.

357
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:12,448
I haven't seen you in a while.

358
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,110
- Hey.
- How did they get the penthouse?

359
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:16,846
They patrol.

360
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,513
It's the only way to make sure

361
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:20,523
there isn't anyone hiding
in the store at night.

362
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,286
Well, they know I'm with you, right?

363
00:19:22,393 --> 00:19:25,521
These two are Carla and Leona.

364
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,066
Not the originals, but third generation,

365
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,567
and what every generation
of Menken dog

366
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:35,833
shall be named until the end of time.

367
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,771
I made my father's
legal counsel add that

368
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,843
to the store's by-laws when I was 9.

369
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:42,310
So even then you enjoyed
telling men what to do.

370
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:45,871
To be fair, the store
was practically home.

371
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,179
My father liked to work.

372
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:50,584
I used to come out here
and talk to them...

373
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:51,814
well, the originals...

374
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:53,652
every night.

375
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:57,626
For a little girl,
a dog can be all you need.

376
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,755
They protect you. They listen.

377
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:03,265
I had my sister, but there weren't other kids.

378
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,860
And, of course,
my mother wasn't around.

379
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:09,565
Well, that's not always a bad thing.

380
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:11,835
Who knows?

381
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:13,843
She died when she was having me.

382
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:19,249
Anyway, my sister
became my only company.

383
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,715
And frankly,

384
00:20:20,818 --> 00:20:22,786
these bitches were easier to handle.

385
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,790
What is this?

386
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:36,332
Don't try to convince me
that you were ever unloved.

387
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:09,192
I don't know what to say.

388
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:20,437
Listen...

389
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:27,374
I'm married.

390
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:37,123
I guess I didn't ask
'cause I didn't want to know.

391
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:41,263
That shouldn't have happened.

392
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,569
Well, you couldn't help yourself.

393
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,764
I knew what I wanted...

394
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:50,807
from the first time
you stormed out of our office.

395
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:52,933
You stormed out of your office.

396
00:21:54,745 --> 00:21:57,714
I took you up here. That was stupid.

397
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:01,508
I just so looked forward
to seeing you again.

398
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,351
Now I guess that's over.

399
00:22:17,435 --> 00:22:18,697
I know you understand

400
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:22,068
I'd rather not have to
explain this to anyone.

401
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:23,162
The account stays.

402
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:25,242
I just want someone else on it.

403
00:22:27,578 --> 00:22:30,103
Don't look at me like that.

404
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,340
What do you do,
just kiss women all the time?

405
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:34,509
Women you aren't married to?

406
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,553
Of course not.

407
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:40,055
Well, then, am I supposed to live
some life running alongside yours?

408
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:50,957
I have some checks to sign.

409
00:23:35,846 --> 00:23:37,609
Excuse me.

410
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:39,444
You dropped your paper.

411
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,944
Thank you.

412
00:24:20,057 --> 00:24:21,149
Daddy!

413
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,783
Daddy! Daddy!

414
00:24:22,893 --> 00:24:24,861
Wake up. It's my birthday.

415
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:26,395
It's my birthday!

416
00:24:26,497 --> 00:24:27,862
It's my birthday!

417
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:30,695
It's not your birthday. It's your party.

418
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:32,029
Don, the party's at 2:00.

419
00:24:32,136 --> 00:24:35,594
You have to put together
the P-L-A-Y-H-O-U-S-E.

420
00:24:36,874 --> 00:24:38,865
How am I going to put together a pony?

421
00:24:38,976 --> 00:24:41,911
A pony? I'm getting a pony?

422
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,106
Bobby, I'm getting a pony!

423
00:24:45,716 --> 00:24:47,377
Great.

424
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:50,949
She'll forget all about it
when she sees the playhouse.

425
00:24:55,526 --> 00:24:58,154
There's a bacon and egg sandwich
for you on the range.

426
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,313
It's got a red door like ours!

427
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:50,937
Daddy!

428
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:53,482
You are not supposed to see this yet.

429
00:25:54,652 --> 00:25:57,246
Why don't you run to the garage
and get me another beer?

430
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:58,413
Okay.

431
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:06,387
Capers?

432
00:26:06,497 --> 00:26:08,260
You want to pick those out of the rug?

433
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,095
Well, they look naked.

434
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:14,069
Well, the only thing
this one wants is raw hamburger.

435
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:16,571
What does that mean?

436
00:26:16,674 --> 00:26:18,039
I think that's enough of that.

437
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:19,473
Well, how many are we?

438
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,135
Us, you...

439
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:22,735
Carlton's with the kids. Make it quick.

440
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,940
The Darlings, Helen Bishop...

441
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:27,381
- You didn't.
- I had to.

442
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,077
She saw me buying balloons at the market.

443
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:30,710
- Didn't seem right.
- So what?

444
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:33,790
I just brought her the pie,
got my dish back at the end.

445
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:36,291
Have you seen her walking
up Downtree Ridge?

446
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,555
Where the hell is she walking to?

447
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:41,824
I don't know.

448
00:26:41,932 --> 00:26:43,092
How old is her kid?

449
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,361
Kids.

450
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:46,595
The boy is 9.

451
00:26:46,704 --> 00:26:48,604
I'm gonna say Gary, maybe Glen?

452
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:50,173
And the baby is a 2-year-old.

453
00:26:50,274 --> 00:26:52,299
She said she was gonna
try and get a sitter.

454
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,401
I would.

455
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,503
It's probably a big event for her.

456
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,079
That man.

457
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:08,388
I know.

458
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:04,873
You didn't use the powder room, did you?

459
00:28:04,982 --> 00:28:06,847
It will appear untouched.

460
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:09,210
Everyone's gonna be here soon.

461
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,288
Why don't you go up
and take a shower?

462
00:28:11,388 --> 00:28:12,946
Want company?

463
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:59,492
Mint juleps. It's that time of year.

464
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:02,436
- Wonderful.
- I'm so thirsty lately.

465
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:07,034
Ready or not, here I come!

466
00:29:07,144 --> 00:29:09,669
There's date nut bread,
cold turkey,

467
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,839
and Waldorf salad for the adults.

468
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:17,912
And I just made
peanut butter sandwiches for the kids.

469
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,751
I know everybody eats that.

470
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:21,518
Thank you.

471
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:23,525
And in case anybody's going to ask,

472
00:29:23,627 --> 00:29:24,992
I did not get that clown.

473
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:26,460
- Oh.
- Oh.

474
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,498
He got booked in some off-Broadway show.

475
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,567
About clowns? I think we saw that.

476
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,831
It's not the one
where they take their clothes off, is it?

477
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,927
Who knew that could be boring?

478
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:39,066
Want something a little
stronger there, Carlton?

479
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:40,234
He'll manage.

480
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:41,834
We were thinking about you, Don.

481
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,904
We saw this thing on TV.

482
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:47,347
It was right in the middle
of the news. It was cute.

483
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:48,645
The guy flying with his hat on.

484
00:29:48,752 --> 00:29:50,947
- Did you do that one?
- It was so cute.

485
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:54,183
- I think the man looks exactly like Henry.
- Except not as handsome.

486
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:56,850
I haven't seen that.

487
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,259
I'm going to go and leave
the kids' food out.

488
00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:01,661
Let's not even bother
trying to get them to sit.

489
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:02,959
I'll co-pilot.

490
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,659
Heard a good one the other day.

491
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:05,666
No, Chet.

492
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:07,066
I'm gonna tell the joke.

493
00:30:07,171 --> 00:30:09,469
Your wife and your lawyer
are drowning.

494
00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:10,904
You have a choice to make:

495
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:13,476
You go to lunch or a movie?

496
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:14,874
It's good, right?

497
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,310
Hey, I'm missing the ball game.

498
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:17,971
I might as well have some fun.

499
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,606
Hey.

500
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,685
So how are things on Mad Ave, Don?

501
00:30:21,785 --> 00:30:23,912
Looks like they're taking care of you.

502
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:26,683
We got it all, huh?

503
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,587
Yep, this is it.

504
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:35,629
Maybe it's his obsession with sports,
but it's been hard for Jack.

505
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:38,668
Marilyn, I've been watching Kevin,
and he gets around very well.

506
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,962
I bet he doesn't know the difference.

507
00:30:43,073 --> 00:30:44,301
He does.

508
00:30:44,408 --> 00:30:46,399
He's very determined.

509
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,536
Jack really gets angry anytime someone
mentions the vaccine,

510
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,581
and I tell him we should be grateful.

511
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:53,741
First of all, it could
have been much worse.

512
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:55,409
It could have gotten to his lungs.

513
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:58,147
Second of all, this can't happen
to other children.

514
00:30:58,255 --> 00:31:00,052
They think they're athletes.

515
00:31:00,157 --> 00:31:01,556
I want to say to Chet,

516
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,820
"I saw you play football in high school.

517
00:31:03,927 --> 00:31:06,987
Your son's going to
be a tackling dummy just like you. "

518
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:18,766
According to Glen here,

519
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:22,073
when the door's a little bit open,
you're supposed to come in.

520
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:24,079
Hello, Helen.

521
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:29,910
I hate to start with a bunch of excuses,
but the babysitter was late,

522
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,851
and I still haven't
unpacked all the boxes,

523
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:34,185
so this was the only paper I could find.

524
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:39,556
It should be Christmas all year
as far as I'm concerned.

525
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:46,058
<i>Ajury in New York City</i>

526
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,569
<i>is expected to receive
the tax evasion paper...</i>

527
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,998
<i>...Opera's production
of Mozart's Marriage of Figaro,</i>

528
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,341
<i>with Robert Merrill and Joan Sutherland.</i>

529
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,847
Don, you have to pick up the cake
from Hightop.

530
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:02,316
Oh, and this is Helen Bishop and Glen.

531
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:03,579
Nice to meet you all.

532
00:32:05,322 --> 00:32:07,222
Don. He goes with me.

533
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:10,293
Then Carlton, Chet, and Jack.

534
00:32:10,394 --> 00:32:11,418
Glen, I'm pretty sure there are

535
00:32:11,528 --> 00:32:12,927
some peanut butter
sandwiches and a BB gun

536
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,962
out there in the backyard.

537
00:32:14,064 --> 00:32:15,463
Why don't you come with me?

538
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:23,364
Don, can I speak with you?

539
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:26,534
Let's see, I told you about the cake,

540
00:32:26,643 --> 00:32:29,612
and... oh, can you take
some movies this time?

541
00:32:29,713 --> 00:32:32,238
Of everyone or just Chief Tiny Tim?

542
00:32:32,349 --> 00:32:35,477
You bought that camera,
and you always forget.

543
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,053
Okay.

544
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:45,588
Ladies, ladies, this is Helen Bishop.

545
00:32:45,696 --> 00:32:47,493
- This is Marilyn.
- Nice to meet you.

546
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:48,587
And Nancy.

547
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:50,826
She seems scared, poor thing.

548
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:54,893
Trust me, those hens are
gonna peck her to death.

549
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:57,701
Do you see her running around
in that little Volkswagen?

550
00:32:57,808 --> 00:32:59,105
That's kind of desperate.

551
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:01,268
That won't help her.
It's got no back seat.

552
00:33:01,378 --> 00:33:03,107
She'll have to find some midget hitchhiker.

553
00:33:05,015 --> 00:33:08,746
Last time I saw one of those,
I think I was throwing a grenade into it.

554
00:33:08,852 --> 00:33:09,750
Yeah.

555
00:33:09,853 --> 00:33:12,344
The problem with Easter break
is it's too long.

556
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:13,684
The doldrums.

557
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:16,624
We're thinking about seven days,
six nights, in Boca Raton,

558
00:33:16,727 --> 00:33:18,820
with mosquitoes as big as a silver dollar.

559
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:22,194
And believe me, those aren't the only
giant noses you'll have to deal with.

560
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:24,062
Francine.

561
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,999
Carlton and I went
there on our honeymoon,

562
00:33:26,103 --> 00:33:28,162
and all I can say
is we were outnumbered.

563
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,170
It's uncomfortable.

564
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,706
You want to be able to relax.

565
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,776
We went to Bermuda
on our honeymoon.

566
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:33,934
Pink sand beaches.

567
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:36,137
Where did you go?

568
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:40,077
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

569
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,752
It's okay. I went to Paris.

570
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:47,619
Four years of Mount Holyoke French.

571
00:33:47,724 --> 00:33:49,214
Haven't used it since.

572
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:55,559
And I wouldn't give it back,
even being with Glen's father.

573
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,566
Is that your ex-husband?

574
00:33:58,802 --> 00:34:00,326
Yes.

575
00:34:01,738 --> 00:34:03,569
I went to Italy.

576
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:04,936
Not on my honeymoon,

577
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:07,772
but right after I graduated from Bryn Mawr.

578
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:09,072
What a summer.

579
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,305
<i>Three Coins in the Fountain.</i>

580
00:34:10,414 --> 00:34:11,745
It was right about that time.

581
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,578
You must have loved Paris.

582
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,083
It's all walking.

583
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:16,812
What do you mean?

584
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,014
Just that I've seen you
walking around the neighborhood.

585
00:34:20,123 --> 00:34:23,752
I've seen you, too, when I was driving.
I think I waved.

586
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,726
Where are you going
when you do that?

587
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:28,730
No place. I just like to walk.

588
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,359
But where?

589
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,301
Anywhere.

590
00:34:35,405 --> 00:34:38,033
It just relaxes me and clears my mind.

591
00:34:38,141 --> 00:34:40,268
I heard on the radio that Einstein did it.

592
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:42,937
Einstein? He's got
his hands into everything.

593
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,686
Sweetie.

594
00:34:57,794 --> 00:34:58,852
Hi, Daddy!

595
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,500
What are you, Frank Sinatra?

596
00:35:14,611 --> 00:35:16,408
I was looking for Glen.

597
00:35:16,513 --> 00:35:19,414
Bunch of them just ran through.

598
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,854
There are the boys.

599
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:26,684
How are we doing?

600
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:33,124
It's, uh, it's Helen, right?

601
00:35:35,465 --> 00:35:37,592
I know your situation,

602
00:35:37,701 --> 00:35:39,999
and my heart breaks for that little boy.

603
00:35:40,103 --> 00:35:41,832
I have a baby, too.

604
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:44,033
You can act strong,

605
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:46,200
but I just want to volunteer.

606
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,402
If you ever need someone

607
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:49,570
to throw the ball
around with him some Sunday,

608
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,545
take him to the beach.

609
00:35:51,648 --> 00:35:53,775
That would be nice.

610
00:35:55,218 --> 00:35:58,278
I'm sure eventually I'd get so used
to your Sunday visits,

611
00:35:58,388 --> 00:36:01,357
I'd join you at the beach,
just the four of us.

612
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:04,427
Then one night, you'd
drop us off at the house

613
00:36:04,528 --> 00:36:07,224
and walk me in with an umbrella.

614
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,662
The kids would go to sleep,

615
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:10,596
and we'd laugh
about all the funny things

616
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,396
that happened at the beach that day.

617
00:36:12,502 --> 00:36:14,663
I don't want you telling Francine

618
00:36:14,771 --> 00:36:17,365
that I suggested
something that I didn't.

619
00:36:17,474 --> 00:36:20,637
Well, I'm sorry if I misunderstood.

620
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,887
You dented the car.

621
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,788
I like sleeping on the couch.

622
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:11,520
I don't like your tone.

623
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:13,823
Take your shoes off.

624
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,016
Interesting crowd in there.

625
00:37:36,586 --> 00:37:38,520
Same crowd out here.

626
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,218
How about the Einstein thing?

627
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:45,385
I wonder if old Albert swung his hips
like that when he walked.

628
00:37:45,495 --> 00:37:47,827
She probably got
her hair tips from him, too.

629
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:49,489
Glen is so quiet.

630
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,226
Not to mention wrinkled.

631
00:37:51,334 --> 00:37:55,100
Maybe she hasn't unpacked
her iron, either.

632
00:37:55,205 --> 00:37:58,299
Christmas paper? Please.

633
00:37:58,408 --> 00:37:59,898
She works.

634
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,808
It has to be hard to run a house, too.

635
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:05,211
Manning a counter
at a jewelry store?

636
00:38:05,315 --> 00:38:06,805
It's not that demanding.

637
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:10,944
I don't know. I had a job in sales
before I was a mom.

638
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:12,783
Have you seen my mom?

639
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:16,552
No, honey. Maybe she's
in the dining room.

640
00:38:19,162 --> 00:38:20,356
Betty.

641
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,488
What?

642
00:38:34,244 --> 00:38:37,008
Don, will you please go
to Hightop and get the cake?

643
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:51,526
Hey. Don't run in the house.

644
00:38:51,628 --> 00:38:52,993
What is going on in here?

645
00:38:53,096 --> 00:38:55,087
Your kid knocked over a drink.

646
00:38:55,198 --> 00:38:58,292
You need to tell him
this is not a jungle gym.

647
00:38:58,401 --> 00:39:01,495
Ernie, did you hear what Mr. Farrelly said?

648
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:05,640
Did you say you were sorry?

649
00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:07,471
Do you want some more?

650
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:10,307
No. Come on. He heard me.

651
00:39:10,413 --> 00:39:13,405
Go get your mother
and have her clean this up.

652
00:39:52,055 --> 00:39:53,613
Okay. Thank you.

653
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,391
The woman at the bakery said

654
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:00,554
he picked up the cake
almost an hour ago.

655
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,757
Do you think he had an accident?

656
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:03,855
Let's go.

657
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:05,764
We haven't done birthday cake.

658
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:07,427
There's not going to be a cake.

659
00:40:07,537 --> 00:40:09,596
Am I the only one that knows that?

660
00:40:10,874 --> 00:40:15,243
Don Draper, you are a first class heel,
and I salute you.

661
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:16,869
Let's go.

662
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,346
Swell party. Food was delicious.

663
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:27,888
I might have a cake.

664
00:40:27,991 --> 00:40:30,289
A Sara Lee in my freezer.

665
00:40:30,393 --> 00:40:32,418
Well, could you go get it?

666
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:34,622
Please. That would be so great.

667
00:40:44,374 --> 00:40:46,899
For she's a jolly good fellow

668
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:49,342
For she's a jolly good fellow

669
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:53,610
For Sally's a jolly good fellow

670
00:40:53,717 --> 00:41:00,520
Which nobody can deny

671
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,855
Happy Birthday, little lady.

672
00:42:21,638 --> 00:42:22,935
Daddy!

673
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:32,610
Mommy, Mommy, look!

674
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,479
Daddy got me a doggy!

675
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,849
I don't even know what to say.

676
00:42:39,956 --> 00:42:42,288
I want to name her...

677
00:42:42,392 --> 00:42:44,826
Polly! Polly doggy!

678
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:55,765
Come on.

679
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,240
Hey.

680
00:43:00,343 --> 00:43:01,401
Hey.

681
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,644
Happy Birthday, baby.
