1
00:00:40,806 --> 00:00:45,436
I know you said to call at night,
but, uh, I haven't been alone.

2
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:49,640
<i>I understand. I have a moment.</i>

3
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:51,272
So how is she?

4
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:53,943
Well, it's only been a short period
in therapeutic time.

5
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:55,280
<i>But she's making progress?</i>

6
00:00:55,387 --> 00:00:58,845
<i>She's not particularly forthcoming yet.</i>

7
00:00:58,957 --> 00:01:00,652
What has she been talking about?

8
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,887
Mostly, she seems consumed
with petty jealousies

9
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:06,624
and overwhelmed
with everyday activities.

10
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:09,166
Basically, we're dealing with
the emotions of a child here.

11
00:01:11,336 --> 00:01:12,963
She wasn't always like this.

12
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:16,632
Well, we're finding that this kind of anxiety
is not uncommon in housewives.

13
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:21,202
<i>And let's not forget, the death of a parent
is extremely destabilizing.</i>

14
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:22,610
So that's it.

15
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:24,807
<i>Well, that's the beginning, certainly.</i>

16
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,816
As she becomes more
forthcoming, we may be able

17
00:01:26,918 --> 00:01:29,682
to shed some light on the deeper issues
as she talks more.

18
00:01:29,788 --> 00:01:32,621
<i>- There are deeper issues?
- Usually.</i>

19
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:36,160
These are not groundbreaking
revelations, Mr. Draper.

20
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:38,126
I'm concerned, obviously.

21
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,994
Of course. We both are.

22
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:43,829
Time and talk. That's what I
recommend right now.

23
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:45,835
And again, evenings are better for me.

24
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:47,962
Well, I appreciate your time.

25
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:55,506
Mona, I am drinking my milk right now.

26
00:01:57,816 --> 00:02:02,810
Go to Mim's. Bring the heiress.

27
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:05,651
The Montclair air might
wipe the scowl off her face.

28
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:08,381
Knock, knock.

29
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:10,854
Call me from there.

30
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:15,497
I'll try to make it out by Sunday afternoon.

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,500
I just got off the phone with UFC,

32
00:02:17,602 --> 00:02:21,265
and they're having the Nixon boys
stop by at the end of the week.

33
00:02:21,373 --> 00:02:23,136
- With Nixon?
- No, thank God.

34
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:27,701
Otherwise, I'd have to move the piano
out of my office.

35
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:33,149
Hopefully, he'll decide he needs us.

36
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:35,776
Well, the ones with the best product
make the worst clients.

37
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:38,253
Stop smoking so much.

38
00:02:38,357 --> 00:02:40,848
It's a sign of weakness.

39
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,654
You know how Hitler
got Neville Chamberlain

40
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:44,922
to give him everything at Munich?

41
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,524
He held the conference
at an old palace that forbid smoking.

42
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:52,501
And after an hour and a half
of not smoking,

43
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:57,405
Neville Chamberlain would have given Hitler
his mother as a dance partner.

44
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:01,445
All I can get from this story
is that Hitler didn't smoke.

45
00:03:01,546 --> 00:03:03,844
And I do.

46
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:06,884
Good night, peanut.

47
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:22,563
Last one to Chumley's gets
to wheel Kenneth Cosgrove,

48
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:25,830
published author, home in a baby carriage.

49
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:47,481
- Hello there.
- Good news.

50
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:49,787
Mona and Margaret are going out of town
for the weekend.

51
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:51,726
Mona's mother fell down the steps.

52
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,526
- You're really blessed.
- Come on over.

53
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:56,897
I'll put on my whites.
We'll pretend it's V.J. Day.

54
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:01,805
What goes in there, an aspirin?

55
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:04,740
I suppose I could have taken a suitcase
anywhere this weekend.

56
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:06,640
And I don't mean your apartment.

57
00:04:06,745 --> 00:04:09,737
I got us a couple of sandwiches,
and filled a thermos for the train.

58
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:12,976
Mr. Sterling, this is Carol, my roommate.

59
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:15,484
Nice to meet you, Carol.

60
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,885
Miss Holloway, I have
an accounting question.

61
00:04:22,694 --> 00:04:27,324
We will go away. Not tonight,
but some weekend coming up.

62
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:29,195
Puerto Rico?

63
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:32,361
I don't care if it's Cuba.
I need a little notice.

64
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:35,201
You've got a lot of rules, Red.

65
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:40,011
Be good, girls.

66
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:43,909
I don't mind you staying
late, just as long as you're not trying

67
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:46,506
- to milk us for the dinner money.
- It's work.

68
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:47,915
Just because tomorrow's Friday
doesn't mean I expect

69
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:50,180
to be pulling your head
off the keys in the morning.

70
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:52,256
What are you doing tonight?

71
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:54,689
Uh, working and going home.

72
00:04:54,793 --> 00:05:00,663
I'll let you enjoy that one, honey,
but I was talking to Donald here.

73
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:04,058
- I'm on the 5:31.
- Reservations at home.

74
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:06,637
I've had those. Easiest ones to break.

75
00:05:06,738 --> 00:05:09,764
Besides, they love it when
you keep them guessing. It adds spice.

76
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,137
Trying to get me in trouble?
Betty's cooking.

77
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:13,108
One drink. You owe me that.

78
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:16,547
- Did I miss something?
- No.

79
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:18,309
Don and I talk all the time
when you're not around.

80
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,906
In fact, we're gonna do it right now.

81
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:21,451
Don? Shall we?

82
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:23,885
- Well, good night, boys.
- Good night, Paul.

83
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:25,354
I love doing that.

84
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:31,792
You seem like a busy little girl.

85
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:33,592
Draper pushing you around enough?

86
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:34,926
What does that mean?

87
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:37,729
Burning the midnight oil
is not good for your skin.

88
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:39,770
Oh, no, it's...

89
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:42,032
It's for something else.
I'm working on copy.

90
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,869
On your own?

91
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:47,775
Mr. Rumsen liked what I did
in the brainstorming thingy.

92
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,676
Sanitary napkins?

93
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:51,874
- No. Lipstick.
- What did I say?

94
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:54,474
It's the Belle Jolie account.

95
00:05:54,586 --> 00:05:57,419
Mr. Campbell, your wife
called from the Four Seasons.

96
00:05:57,522 --> 00:06:00,184
- They've been seated.
- Thank you, Hildy.

97
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,661
Want me to take a look at it?
I do it for a lot of the fellows.

98
00:06:05,764 --> 00:06:07,595
Really?

99
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,166
Yeah. Really.

100
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:11,360
That would be super.

101
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:13,460
Well, we're all in it together.

102
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:25,373
Two!

103
00:06:30,488 --> 00:06:34,948
So they fired all the guys in the middle
and moved up their mail room staff,

104
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,551
right before all the salaries got expensive.

105
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:39,027
Smart.

106
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,098
Is that what we're gonna do?

107
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:45,169
We're not going to do anything.

108
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:53,840
At a certain age, they lose that.

109
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:55,378
What?

110
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,881
That glow of pure youth.

111
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:01,509
It's like they hit 30,
and somebody puts out a light.

112
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:07,585
I don't think those two
have 30 years between them.

113
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:09,785
Polka dots looks like a lot of fun.

114
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:14,095
Yeah, you'll have to let me know.

115
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:17,731
Jesus, you must be starving.

116
00:07:17,836 --> 00:07:20,168
I know I am. What's Betty making?

117
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,637
I don't know.

118
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:26,177
Mona hasn't cooked since
Margaret stopped eating.

119
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:28,905
They're fighting it out.
I'm the one that gets hurt.

120
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:37,347
I'll call Betty. Tell her we'll be three.

121
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:39,821
No!

122
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:42,722
- You sure?
- Are you kidding?

123
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:44,590
She'll be thrilled.

124
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:46,891
When's the last time she saw you?

125
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:48,989
We'll take my car.
Save you train fare.

126
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:09,612
- My eyes are burning.
- That's impossible.

127
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:12,019
That better not be Daddy
saying he's going to be late.

128
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,885
Don't do gymnastics in the house.

129
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:21,393
<i>Draper residence.</i>

130
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:23,194
<i>You are coming home, right?</i>

131
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:25,735
Yes. I'm coming home.

132
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:29,170
Unfortunately, Roger has decided
he needs a home-cooked meal.

133
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:31,299
You're kidding.

134
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:33,172
I don't know if I have enough food.

135
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:35,439
Birdie, what do you put in
that freezer I bought you?

136
00:08:36,915 --> 00:08:38,109
Frozen food.

137
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:40,241
What do you want me to say?

138
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:56,363
Betty, this steak...

139
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:58,527
You sure you don't want some?

140
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:01,434
No, thank you, Roger.

141
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:03,734
I'm a vegetarian sometimes.

142
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:06,106
Mona has a little calorie book
she keeps on the refrigerator.

143
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,839
Always has her nose in there.

144
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:10,608
Maybe she wants
to look good for you.

145
00:09:10,715 --> 00:09:13,275
Isn't that a nice thought?

146
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:16,444
I was pudgy as a girl, if you can believe it.

147
00:09:16,554 --> 00:09:18,078
I came into Home Ec in the 8th grade

148
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:19,588
with a pattern for big girl pajamas.

149
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:22,592
The teacher asked who I was
making the pajamas for.

150
00:09:22,694 --> 00:09:25,925
I didn't realize how much
weight I'd lost that summer.

151
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,089
Swim camp, I guess.

152
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:30,224
I went from Tadpole to Polliwog that year.

153
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:32,803
Sounds like a lateral move.

154
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:34,997
When I was little, in the summer
we used to swim at night.

155
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:37,301
In a pool, not the ocean.

156
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:38,397
Warm air,

157
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,478
light dancing in the blue...

158
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:43,775
Night swimming. It's divine.

159
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:45,713
Sometimes naked.

160
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:49,651
Believe me, on those nights,
it was very difficult to go to sleep.

161
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:51,346
You ever experienced that, Don?

162
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:53,856
Trouble sleeping? Never.

163
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,017
Your husband's a funny son of a bitch,
you know that, Betty?

164
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:57,788
Yeah.

165
00:09:57,896 --> 00:09:59,523
We used to swim in a quarry.

166
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:03,596
By the way you drop your G's
every once in a while,

167
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,965
I always thought
you were raised on a farm.

168
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,197
Someplace with a swimmin' hole.

169
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:16,175
What do you say we go
to a commercial break...

170
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:18,408
brought to you by more liquor?

171
00:10:21,252 --> 00:10:23,083
You two.

172
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,453
Oh. Jesus, don't tell me
it's your anniversary.

173
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:31,085
- No.
- Don't worry.

174
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:33,721
Sally got this frosting machine.

175
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:35,800
Oh. "Mommy and Daddy. "

176
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,697
Simple, to the point, colloquial.

177
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:40,032
She writes like her father.

178
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:49,803
I'll get hers. You get your own.

179
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:51,313
Three on a match.

180
00:10:53,651 --> 00:10:55,516
Never understood that.

181
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,952
Is that like three on a horse?

182
00:10:58,056 --> 00:11:00,616
Trench war. First war.

183
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:04,627
They used to say,
"First man lights up, they notice you.

184
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:06,060
"Second man, Jerry takes aim.

185
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:08,189
<i>Third one... Auf wiedersehen. "</i>

186
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:10,699
But the professional wisdom
says that one of our guys

187
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:12,667
came up with that,
as a way to sell matches.

188
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,238
You tell your kids there's no Santa Claus?

189
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,570
He'd never do that.

190
00:11:18,776 --> 00:11:21,973
Tell us another story.
A true one, though.

191
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:28,476
Well, my father was in the trenches.

192
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:30,315
With a bayonet.

193
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:33,314
Think about that.

194
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:36,393
Poking a man to death
three feet away from you.

195
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:40,797
What does that sound like?

196
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:42,662
Don never talks about the war.

197
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:44,962
The war? His war, you mean.

198
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:47,731
Not much to say.

199
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,739
You boys used up all the glory.

200
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:52,241
We did, didn't we?

201
00:11:52,343 --> 00:11:56,905
'Course, my old man will always
have one on me with that bayonet.

202
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:59,381
My biggest hit came
when we were running oil

203
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:01,452
down to the islands
in the South China Sea.

204
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:04,316
The Pacific was all about gasoline.

205
00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:06,185
People forget that.

206
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,351
You know what?
I don't like to talk about it, either.

207
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:15,792
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

208
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,798
Not much.

209
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:19,802
Now you have to tell us.

210
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,739
Well, the third day we picked up
a Dinah circling the convoy.

211
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:28,812
A recon plane.

212
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:31,882
They were mapping us for the Nip suicide
submarines up ahead...

213
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:36,443
<i>kaitens... basically, warheads with motors.</i>

214
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:39,022
Made us feel good to know we had
such a dedicated enemy.

215
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:40,750
That's one way of thinking about it.

216
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:46,020
Maybe I was bored, but I thought,
We should get that little plane.

217
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,961
Bored? What about scared?

218
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:49,658
That never comes in to these stories.

219
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:51,894
You're making me look bad
in front of the lady.

220
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:55,166
That's impossible. Finish your story.

221
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:58,466
Well, we gave it to 'em.

222
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:01,374
Right at 12:00.

223
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:03,310
He was going away from us,
but we hit him.

224
00:13:03,414 --> 00:13:06,247
I watched him dive into the waves
just beyond the horizon.

225
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:10,344
It was strange, because
we knew it was over for him,

226
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:12,685
but we didn't see or hear much.

227
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,250
The next four hours,
I took us off course, just to swing by.

228
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:19,990
Looking for a hole
in the ocean, I guess.

229
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:23,864
We saw the wreckage.
No chute, no body.

230
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:29,705
It's incredible that something
that heavy can float.

231
00:13:30,742 --> 00:13:32,710
Isn't that something?

232
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,041
- Bet they gave you a medal.
- They did.

233
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:37,478
But not for that. It was for drinking.

234
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,181
Can something be done
about this sadness?

235
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:43,014
Want to switch to gin?

236
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,590
Did you check the golf bag?

237
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:50,752
I have something out in the garage
left over from New Year's.

238
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:55,090
I don't care if it has ants in it.

239
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,633
Roger, please, the kids.

240
00:14:09,947 --> 00:14:12,609
Sally will be happy
her cake was such a hit.

241
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:15,049
Make sure you tell her

242
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:17,713
I ate the "M" in "Mom. "

243
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:20,723
- Roger...
- I can't believe you've had two babies.

244
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:24,924
Don't do that.

245
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:27,463
You've been making eyes at me all night.

246
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:29,999
You can't tell me that I'm
not giving you hot pants.

247
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:33,361
You smell so good.

248
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,004
I can make more coffee.

249
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:40,407
I just want you to know
that when I go to sleep tonight,

250
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:42,138
I will be thinking all about you.

251
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,625
Where'd you go, to Russia to get that?

252
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,994
No, I ran down the street
knocking on doors.

253
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,306
Come on, you two. Come on out here
and wish me a bon voyage.

254
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:19,007
I was just saying
what a lucky man you are.

255
00:15:19,117 --> 00:15:21,381
Beautiful children. Enjoy it.

256
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:24,914
One minute you're drinking at a bar,

257
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:26,785
and they come and tell you
your kid's been born,

258
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:29,018
next thing you know,
they're heading off to college.

259
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:38,933
Well, I should be on my way.

260
00:15:39,036 --> 00:15:40,901
I'll take this for the road.

261
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:43,598
I'll walk you out.

262
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:53,483
Magical night.

263
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:05,858
That's my car.

264
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:09,396
There you go.

265
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:13,099
Lights!

266
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:31,119
- What was that?
- What?

267
00:16:31,222 --> 00:16:33,315
That. Him.

268
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:37,190
Felt like someone turned the oven on
when I came back in here with that bottle.

269
00:16:37,295 --> 00:16:39,490
- That's ridiculous.
- Bullshit.

270
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:41,292
Nothing happened, Don.

271
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,867
Other than your drunk boss
ruining our evening.

272
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:45,936
Can we leave it at that?

273
00:16:46,037 --> 00:16:48,096
You seemed to be having a grand time.

274
00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:51,941
I liked the wine.

275
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:53,601
You made a fool of yourself.

276
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:55,736
Why would you say that?

277
00:16:55,846 --> 00:16:58,212
You were throwing yourself at him.
Giggling at his stories.

278
00:16:58,316 --> 00:17:00,546
I was being friendly. He's your boss.

279
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:03,279
I don't like to be treated that way
in my own home.

280
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:06,247
I know what I saw.

281
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,224
You want to bounce me off the walls?

282
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:15,391
Would that make you feel better?

283
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:24,836
Sometimes I feel like
I'm living with a little girl.

284
00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:38,584
Humps, where were you last night?

285
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:44,594
I had a dinner with my in-laws
at the Four Seasons... poolside.

286
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:46,925
Sounds refreshing.

287
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:49,261
Norman Mailer, Mayor Wagner.

288
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:51,892
The naked and the dead.

289
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:54,471
- What's in the box?
- It's a wedding present.

290
00:17:54,572 --> 00:17:56,870
- We got two.
- But what is it?

291
00:17:56,974 --> 00:17:59,465
- It's a Chip 'n' Dip.
- Let me see.

292
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:00,908
- Are you serious?
- Yeah!

293
00:18:01,012 --> 00:18:02,570
I'm might have to go
to somebody else's wedding.

294
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,147
I like to know what people are returning.

295
00:18:10,955 --> 00:18:12,752
What?

296
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:14,757
I don't know what to say.
You got two of these?

297
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:17,350
- What is it?
- You have your fingers in your ears?

298
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:19,759
It's a Chip 'n' Dip.
You have your friends over.

299
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:22,389
You put chips on the sides
and dip in the middle.

300
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:25,798
- Dip?
- Yes.

301
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:27,700
We went to these peoples' house,
and they had one.

302
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:31,070
It had sour cream with these
little brown onions in it.

303
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:32,472
It was very good.

304
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:34,942
You'll have to give me
that recipe sometime.

305
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,308
Cost 22 bucks.

306
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:39,383
- Shit!
- So.

307
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:41,007
I'm going to return it.

308
00:18:41,118 --> 00:18:43,848
Today? Freddy Rumsen's
cousin works at General Mills.

309
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:45,581
We're all going to Ratazzi's for lunch.

310
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,181
- Maybe dinner.
- No.

311
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:51,887
- I have to return this thing.
- "Today," she said, I'm sure.

312
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:53,691
I like doing things for her.

313
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:55,322
You're right. I'm sorry.

314
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:58,027
When you finish shopping,
come join us.

315
00:18:58,135 --> 00:19:01,229
I hear they make a great
Grasshopper, Mildred.

316
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:12,808
<i>Mr. Draper? Mr. Sterling to see you.</i>

317
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:24,624
Send him in.

318
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,793
Something for the golf bag.

319
00:19:32,236 --> 00:19:33,294
That's the good stuff.

320
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,101
I take it you got home in one piece.

321
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:41,872
I made it as far as the Knights Inn
off the Taconic.

322
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:45,380
I know that place.
It's got great water pressure.

323
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:48,077
Yeah, I slept in the car.

324
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:49,482
About last night.

325
00:19:49,587 --> 00:19:52,215
What about it?

326
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:57,257
When a man gets to the point
when his name's on the building,

327
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:59,852
he can get an unnatural
sense of entitlement.

328
00:19:59,964 --> 00:20:01,625
What does that mean, Roger?

329
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:04,292
You're not gonna make this easy.

330
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:06,461
I don't even know what this is.

331
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:12,740
One night, years ago,
I got very drunk.

332
00:20:12,843 --> 00:20:14,538
I drive home to my building,

333
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:16,442
pull into the garage, park at my spot.

334
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:18,572
I get in the elevator.

335
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:20,081
It's late. There's no operator.

336
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:22,379
Go up to the 12th floor. Get out.

337
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:24,010
I'm walking down the hall.

338
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:26,282
It's pink and orange.

339
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,382
I remember how ugly it was.

340
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:31,961
Suddenly, my key
won't fit in the door.

341
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:34,928
Wasn't my building.

342
00:20:38,335 --> 00:20:41,168
I guess what I'm saying is, uh...

343
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:44,207
at some point, we've all
parked in the wrong garage.

344
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:49,542
Thanks for the bottle, Roger.

345
00:20:49,647 --> 00:20:51,046
And?

346
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:56,679
Betty's going to want that glass back.

347
00:20:56,787 --> 00:20:58,254
Good man.

348
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:05,953
Maybe I should get a case of those, huh?

349
00:21:22,146 --> 00:21:24,137
This is taking a long time.

350
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:25,772
Is it that complicated?

351
00:21:25,883 --> 00:21:28,613
Ah, the blue box.
You must be a newlywed.

352
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:30,118
That explains it.

353
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:32,416
Yes, it does. Adorable.

354
00:21:32,523 --> 00:21:35,856
My husband, he'd rather
be drinking at lunch,

355
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,621
even when we were newlyweds, I think.

356
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:39,025
He's in advertising.

357
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:40,926
I'm in advertising. Sterling Cooper.

358
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:43,329
He's at BBDO. Media buyer.

359
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:44,458
Jim Wallace.

360
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:45,694
Don't know him.

361
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:48,397
That's because you're here at lunch.

362
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,872
Next.

363
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm here to return this.

364
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,304
There's nothing wrong with it.

365
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:55,935
We got two.

366
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:59,243
That's why we suggest that people register,
to avoid duplications.

367
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,113
We did register. We got two.

368
00:22:01,218 --> 00:22:02,845
Do you have your receipt?

369
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:05,217
It was a gift.

370
00:22:05,322 --> 00:22:08,291
Rosemary, we have a bridal return.

371
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:09,518
Him?

372
00:22:09,627 --> 00:22:11,288
Bridal registry.

373
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:16,162
It's a Chip 'n' Dip. We got two.

374
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:18,701
That's practically four of something.

375
00:22:19,803 --> 00:22:20,963
Name?

376
00:22:21,071 --> 00:22:22,038
Campbell.

377
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:23,697
I suppose you don't have a receipt.

378
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:25,331
Gosh, I wish I did.

379
00:22:25,442 --> 00:22:27,706
No. It was a gift.

380
00:22:30,447 --> 00:22:31,675
There's nothing here.

381
00:22:31,782 --> 00:22:33,716
Perhaps your wife told you
she was registering

382
00:22:33,817 --> 00:22:35,512
and in the end forgot
to give us her name.

383
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:36,711
Her name?

384
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,720
Yes. It's under the maiden name.

385
00:22:38,822 --> 00:22:40,449
Hmm. It's Vogel.

386
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:42,355
Why would you do that?

387
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:43,585
I don't know.

388
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:46,022
Humps.

389
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,690
Humps the Camel Campbell.

390
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,427
Matherton. What are you doing here?

391
00:22:51,535 --> 00:22:53,503
Getting my racquet restrung.

392
00:22:53,604 --> 00:22:55,128
Men's room back this way?

393
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:57,434
Down the hall past the water fountain.

394
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,634
What are you doing here?

395
00:22:59,743 --> 00:23:01,267
Returning a wedding gift.

396
00:23:01,378 --> 00:23:03,141
Not mine, I hope.

397
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:06,307
No, it's a Chip 'n' Dip. Trudy's aunt.

398
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:09,784
That's Trudy Vogel. Do you mind, lovely?

399
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:10,945
Uh, what is it?

400
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:12,955
It's a Chip 'n' Dip.

401
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:16,584
You put chips on the side
and dip in the middle.

402
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:18,457
For entertaining.

403
00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:19,893
It's a beaut.

404
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:21,555
Hell of a wedding, by the way.

405
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:24,600
Your cousin Bethany...
bridesmaid's bridesmaid.

406
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:28,464
Connecticut College for Women, indeed.

407
00:23:28,572 --> 00:23:30,369
I think I found it.

408
00:23:32,242 --> 00:23:34,005
That's nice.

409
00:23:34,111 --> 00:23:37,239
Good to see you.
We should do this sometime.

410
00:23:37,348 --> 00:23:39,009
I'm coming back for you.

411
00:23:42,586 --> 00:23:44,611
Do you have a receipt?

412
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:46,952
No. I might have already said that.

413
00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:49,321
It was a gift.

414
00:23:49,426 --> 00:23:50,791
I can give you store credit.

415
00:23:50,894 --> 00:23:52,088
I was expecting cash.

416
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:54,426
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:57,329
Isn't there a way we could work this out?

418
00:23:57,434 --> 00:23:59,425
Let me by you a drink.

419
00:23:59,536 --> 00:24:01,561
I have an expense account.

420
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:05,832
The best I can do is put
the store credit in your name

421
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:07,205
so you can spend it here.

422
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:10,280
I would think about spending it on you
if you gave me cash.

423
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:11,370
It's $22.

424
00:24:11,482 --> 00:24:13,575
Store credit.

425
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:16,179
Thank you.

426
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,521
By the way, Matherton...

427
00:24:22,593 --> 00:24:24,561
he has the clap.

428
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,267
Same price as a Chip 'n' Dip.

429
00:24:37,107 --> 00:24:38,506
Amazing.

430
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:42,178
And I was going to try
to make you feel bad

431
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:44,144
by telling you where
Carlotta's stockings end.

432
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:45,909
What the hell is that for?

433
00:24:46,016 --> 00:24:47,483
It's for me.

434
00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:49,552
.22 caliber bolt action.

435
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:51,484
Use it in good health.

436
00:24:51,588 --> 00:24:53,351
Why not?

437
00:24:53,457 --> 00:24:55,584
Boys will be boys, right?

438
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:02,561
You couldn't hit the side
of St. Patrick's with that.

439
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:05,100
It's good for 20 yards.

440
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:23,016
It's your 4:30, Mr. Campbell.

441
00:25:32,229 --> 00:25:35,130
The Nixon brain trust
is coming in tomorrow.

442
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,723
The nomination is expected as a lock.

443
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:39,462
All we need is an opponent.

444
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,596
Rumor is Lyndon Johnson's
going to be making a play at the Convention,

445
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:44,936
so we may not be going
against Kennedy at all.

446
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:46,441
Then we have to worry
about the South.

447
00:25:46,543 --> 00:25:48,374
It's going to be Kennedy.

448
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:51,642
Boston Blackie won West Virginia.

449
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:53,774
Now, where does that leave us?

450
00:25:53,884 --> 00:25:56,944
"Nixon: Experience in office,
knows foreign affairs. "

451
00:25:57,054 --> 00:25:58,146
He probably learned that

452
00:25:58,255 --> 00:26:01,156
when they were throwing
rocks at him in Caracas.

453
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:04,022
"Knows the real threat of communism,
home and abroad. "

454
00:26:04,128 --> 00:26:07,154
He's not helping himself
keeping quiet on Castro.

455
00:26:07,264 --> 00:26:08,595
True, but he's not a Catholic.

456
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:09,996
Our hands are tied there.

457
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,967
Nixon thinks hitting
the Catholic thing is a bad idea.

458
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,628
They're going to say that.

459
00:26:14,738 --> 00:26:15,898
To us? They believe it.

460
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:18,065
It hasn't held up
in any of the primaries.

461
00:26:18,175 --> 00:26:20,405
Kennedy keeps making
opponents apologize.

462
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:21,910
For what?

463
00:26:22,012 --> 00:26:23,479
For being intolerant.

464
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,842
This is Dick Nixon we're talking about.

465
00:26:24,948 --> 00:26:26,108
You may be too young to remember

466
00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:30,277
the "pink lady" congress... woman
from California.

467
00:26:30,387 --> 00:26:32,514
He practically shot her in the face to win.

468
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:35,383
If it is Kennedy,

469
00:26:35,492 --> 00:26:37,824
Nixon will lower himself
to the occasion.

470
00:26:37,928 --> 00:26:39,657
It's going to be Kennedy.

471
00:26:39,763 --> 00:26:42,254
Good. Catholic son of a millionaire.

472
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:45,597
A boy too scared to do anything
but go on vacation.

473
00:26:45,702 --> 00:26:48,603
I met him. He is a boy.

474
00:26:48,705 --> 00:26:49,899
He's only four years
younger than Nixon.

475
00:26:50,007 --> 00:26:52,475
But has he been sitting
next to the leader of the free world

476
00:26:52,576 --> 00:26:53,474
for twice that time?

477
00:26:53,577 --> 00:26:54,976
He's inexperienced.

478
00:26:55,078 --> 00:26:56,602
He doesn't even wear a hat.

479
00:26:56,713 --> 00:26:58,647
I don't know.

480
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:00,842
You know who else
doesn't wear a hat?

481
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:02,145
Elvis.

482
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:04,846
That's what we're dealing with.

483
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:10,589
Remind me to stop
hiring young people.

484
00:27:10,694 --> 00:27:12,218
America does not want
some greasy kid

485
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:15,321
with his finger on the button.

486
00:27:15,432 --> 00:27:17,832
Now if the adults can weigh in?

487
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:28,501
"Communism, taxes, health care. "

488
00:27:28,612 --> 00:27:32,104
Kinsey, you want to write this down,
or should I call a girl in?

489
00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:44,694
Hi, honey. I made a roast beef.

490
00:27:44,795 --> 00:27:46,558
Just cut the strings.

491
00:27:46,663 --> 00:27:47,960
Oh, roast beef?

492
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:51,563
You know it's just me tonight, right?

493
00:28:07,184 --> 00:28:10,244
That was a wedding gift
from my Aunt Letty!

494
00:28:10,354 --> 00:28:12,185
And you go and get some stupid toy?

495
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:13,483
I can't believe you!

496
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,490
That was for us!

497
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:17,321
You're always telling me to grow up.

498
00:28:17,427 --> 00:28:19,327
I can't believe you!

499
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,758
Oh, I can leave it there?

500
00:28:24,868 --> 00:28:25,766
Thanks.

501
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:26,995
Great. Thank you.

502
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:52,858
Hollis, let me ask you something.

503
00:29:05,943 --> 00:29:07,706
Uh, Mr. Campbell,

504
00:29:07,811 --> 00:29:11,110
I thought I'd take you up on your offer
to look at my work.

505
00:29:11,214 --> 00:29:12,875
But if you're in the middle of something...

506
00:29:18,522 --> 00:29:19,580
What's that?

507
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:22,158
A wedding present.

508
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:25,892
I really appreciate it.

509
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,458
You ever been hunting, Peggy?

510
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:32,626
No, I don't think so.

511
00:29:32,736 --> 00:29:34,795
You either have or you haven't.

512
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:37,703
I went a couple of times with my uncle.

513
00:29:37,808 --> 00:29:38,934
New Hampshire.

514
00:29:40,844 --> 00:29:43,506
I saw my cousin shoot a rabbit
by Coney Island.

515
00:29:43,613 --> 00:29:46,446
It's an incredible sensation.

516
00:29:48,051 --> 00:29:50,417
You have to be very quiet.

517
00:29:55,392 --> 00:29:56,950
Take it down with the first shot,

518
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,550
or you scare it away.

519
00:29:58,662 --> 00:30:01,893
And sometimes you have to go up
and finish it off.

520
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:07,134
Then you tie it to the bumper,
and you go home.

521
00:30:10,273 --> 00:30:12,434
But you know what I've
always wanted to do?

522
00:30:14,177 --> 00:30:16,805
I would pick it up...

523
00:30:16,913 --> 00:30:19,108
throw its back legs over my shoulder,

524
00:30:19,216 --> 00:30:23,516
and I would drag it through the snow
to this little cabin.

525
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,611
And there...

526
00:30:25,722 --> 00:30:27,383
I'd hang it up...

527
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:30,426
between a couple of trees,

528
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:32,256
cut it open,

529
00:30:32,362 --> 00:30:33,590
drain it,

530
00:30:33,697 --> 00:30:36,359
dress it,

531
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:38,331
and then I'd take
my big hunting knife,

532
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:42,963
and I'd cut this loin
right out of the side.

533
00:30:47,244 --> 00:30:49,838
And I'd go into the cabin,

534
00:30:49,946 --> 00:30:54,110
and there'd be this woman
waiting for me,

535
00:30:54,217 --> 00:30:56,811
standing by one of those old stoves

536
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,478
with a big black pipe,

537
00:30:58,588 --> 00:31:00,180
and I'd hand it to her,

538
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:03,418
and she'd put it in a cast-iron skillet,

539
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:07,054
and then I'd sit at the table...

540
00:31:07,164 --> 00:31:09,792
and she'd bring it to me.

541
00:31:11,768 --> 00:31:14,430
And I'd wipe my knife on my knee...

542
00:31:16,273 --> 00:31:20,869
and then I would eat it
while she watches.

543
00:31:23,447 --> 00:31:25,540
That would be wonderful.

544
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:31,850
I'll take a look at this for you.

545
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:38,355
Thank you.

546
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:04,886
Can I get a ham sandwich?

547
00:32:07,157 --> 00:32:09,091
You know what?
I'll take a cherry Danish.

548
00:32:09,192 --> 00:32:11,456
The big one in the back.

549
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:19,165
Thank you, ma'am. There you go.

550
00:32:43,994 --> 00:32:46,622
Helen. Hello.

551
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,891
Hi, Betty.

552
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:50,364
How are you?

553
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,490
I'm well.

554
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:54,729
And how's Glen?

555
00:32:57,807 --> 00:32:59,570
I wasn't going to say anything.

556
00:32:59,676 --> 00:33:01,803
I was just going to go right on by.

557
00:33:01,912 --> 00:33:04,676
What's wrong?

558
00:33:04,781 --> 00:33:08,444
I was going...

559
00:33:11,188 --> 00:33:14,021
I was going through Glen's
treasure box the other day,

560
00:33:14,124 --> 00:33:16,649
and I found a lock of blonde hair.

561
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,227
Your hair, he says.

562
00:33:18,328 --> 00:33:20,853
Well, I don't know what he told you.

563
00:33:20,964 --> 00:33:22,261
Glen doesn't lie, not when he's caught.

564
00:33:22,365 --> 00:33:24,128
- I'm not saying it's a lie.
- Betty.

565
00:33:25,235 --> 00:33:26,532
He asked me for it.

566
00:33:26,636 --> 00:33:28,001
And you gave it to him?

567
00:33:28,104 --> 00:33:29,867
He is 9 years old.

568
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:33,233
What is wrong with you?

569
00:33:46,923 --> 00:33:49,915
He was a bold man
that first ate an oyster.

570
00:33:50,026 --> 00:33:53,325
I believe that was Jonathan Swift.

571
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,988
Are we naming them now?

572
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:58,100
Look at you.

573
00:33:58,201 --> 00:33:59,930
I had no idea you were
such a fan of the mollusk.

574
00:34:00,036 --> 00:34:05,702
Never gave them a chance before,
but I'm acquiring a taste.

575
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:07,640
It's like eating a mermaid.

576
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:13,612
Ready for another,
or have you topped off your tank?

577
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:15,446
You're leading this dance.

578
00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:18,544
Well, what the hell? It's the G.O.P.

579
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:21,055
They'll never smell it
over the stench of Brylcreem.

580
00:34:22,626 --> 00:34:23,752
Another round.

581
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,760
Wait. Are you still good with these,

582
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:27,591
or do you prefer your beloved rye?

583
00:34:27,697 --> 00:34:30,291
Today I'm on the Roger Sterling diet.

584
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,734
Easy on the vermouth,
another dozen of these.

585
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:36,738
Me, as well.

586
00:34:39,276 --> 00:34:42,507
I've always thought you were
a man who could keep up, Don.

587
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,562
Anything else, gentlemen?

588
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:04,531
Did you know
they served cheesecake

589
00:35:04,634 --> 00:35:06,659
to the Olympic athletes
in ancient Greece?

590
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:10,137
So what's an extra lap or two
around the steno pool for us?

591
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,502
Two cheesecakes.

592
00:35:11,608 --> 00:35:14,543
And don't let me see
the bottom of this glass.

593
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:18,647
What were we talking about?

594
00:35:18,748 --> 00:35:20,079
Oh, yes, the Russians.

595
00:35:20,183 --> 00:35:22,549
Shooting those dogs into space.

596
00:35:22,652 --> 00:35:27,521
I believe we branded them cat lovers
and moved on to the subject of true love.

597
00:35:27,624 --> 00:35:30,593
Right. Desi and Lucy... please.

598
00:35:30,694 --> 00:35:32,389
He's divorcing her again.

599
00:35:32,495 --> 00:35:35,931
Did he wake up one morning and say
"Oh, yeah, I forgot, I hate you"?

600
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:41,234
What makes a man marry
the same woman twice?

601
00:35:41,338 --> 00:35:43,135
I believe in his case,

602
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:45,070
it was the lure of orange hair.

603
00:35:47,243 --> 00:35:49,302
I like redheads.

604
00:35:49,412 --> 00:35:54,076
Their mouths are like a drop
of strawberry jam in a glass of milk.

605
00:35:58,221 --> 00:36:00,382
I think I woke my ulcer up.

606
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,390
Drinking milk.

607
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:04,722
I never liked it.

608
00:36:04,828 --> 00:36:06,318
I hate cows.

609
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,894
You keep matching me like this,

610
00:36:15,004 --> 00:36:17,564
you'll have an ulcer
of your own, any day now.

611
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:20,376
One more?

612
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:22,843
Instead of coffee?

613
00:36:22,946 --> 00:36:24,208
Sure.

614
00:36:24,314 --> 00:36:26,043
But then we should get the check.

615
00:36:45,502 --> 00:36:48,335
Hey, Birdie. I have the shirt.

616
00:36:50,373 --> 00:36:52,102
What is this?

617
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:54,938
Bobby spilled some Concord grape juice
down the front of it.

618
00:36:55,044 --> 00:36:56,238
I washed it.

619
00:36:56,346 --> 00:36:59,782
Uh, this is Ernie's shirt, not Bobby's.

620
00:36:59,883 --> 00:37:01,851
Well, what do you know?

621
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:05,614
Oh, did you have a party
you didn't invite me to?

622
00:37:05,722 --> 00:37:09,715
I'll invite you. It's going to be a dinner party.

623
00:37:09,826 --> 00:37:11,691
I'm just trying the wine, you know.

624
00:37:11,795 --> 00:37:14,195
Develop my palate.

625
00:37:14,297 --> 00:37:15,855
Do you want some? It's a split.

626
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:17,728
There's another glass.

627
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:19,426
How are you?

628
00:37:19,536 --> 00:37:21,026
I'm good.

629
00:37:23,573 --> 00:37:25,837
Maybe I will try some.

630
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:33,974
Betty,

631
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:36,745
Jill Sandifer was
in the market earlier today.

632
00:37:36,853 --> 00:37:38,514
What?

633
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:40,521
Is it true?

634
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:42,090
You're my friend, Francine.

635
00:37:42,192 --> 00:37:43,591
Are you coming over here to do recon?

636
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:45,183
I'm worried about you.

637
00:37:56,172 --> 00:37:58,231
I don't know what happened.

638
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:02,674
I kept thinking in the car
on the way back,

639
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:05,077
"Did that really happen?"

640
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:06,978
And...

641
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:08,675
then I just put it out of my mind.

642
00:38:08,785 --> 00:38:10,650
Well, what did happen?

643
00:38:10,753 --> 00:38:12,380
Whatever you heard.

644
00:38:15,024 --> 00:38:17,584
I mean, I don't even want to hear it.

645
00:38:17,694 --> 00:38:19,685
I have my own version,
and it's plenty.

646
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:20,854
It's okay.

647
00:38:20,964 --> 00:38:22,022
Honestly, I don't know anyone

648
00:38:22,131 --> 00:38:24,361
who wouldn't want
to take a good poke at her.

649
00:38:24,467 --> 00:38:25,729
She's so selfish.

650
00:38:25,835 --> 00:38:27,302
Those long walks

651
00:38:27,403 --> 00:38:31,169
and that pathetic job
at Benson's Jewelry.

652
00:38:31,274 --> 00:38:33,765
Carlton went in there
to buy me some earrings.

653
00:38:33,877 --> 00:38:36,641
I'm sure she loved that.

654
00:38:36,746 --> 00:38:38,577
When I saw the Benson's Jewelry
wrapping paper,

655
00:38:38,681 --> 00:38:40,615
I almost threw it in his face.

656
00:38:40,717 --> 00:38:44,312
And that John Kennedy. I hate him.

657
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,910
Really?

658
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,551
What will people think?

659
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:51,889
I think they'll be glad
to know you're not a marshmallow.

660
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:54,623
Do people think I'm weak?

661
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:57,757
No. It's just you're so sweet and perfect.

662
00:38:57,867 --> 00:38:59,164
I'm not.

663
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:01,066
Well, it does seem that way.

664
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,365
Look, it'll all be forgotten.

665
00:39:03,473 --> 00:39:06,533
We don't have to include
Helen Bishop anymore.

666
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:09,134
Let her know
whose side we're all on.

667
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,275
Uh, my mother...

668
00:39:14,384 --> 00:39:15,942
always said,

669
00:39:16,052 --> 00:39:18,543
"You're painting a masterpiece.

670
00:39:18,655 --> 00:39:22,751
Make sure to hide the brushstrokes. "

671
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:24,793
She was really beautiful.

672
00:39:24,894 --> 00:39:29,092
Then I think, um...

673
00:39:29,198 --> 00:39:31,792
"Why am I doing all this? I'm not that vain. "

674
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:33,960
What does Dr. Wayne say?

675
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,662
Nothing...

676
00:39:35,772 --> 00:39:39,139
except "Tell me more about that. "

677
00:39:39,242 --> 00:39:41,938
I'm still dying to try it.

678
00:39:42,045 --> 00:39:48,609
I'm pretty sure Dr. Wayne tried
to look down my neckline the other day.

679
00:39:48,718 --> 00:39:50,208
He sits behind me.

680
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,051
And as far as I'm concerned,
as long as men look at me that way,

681
00:39:54,157 --> 00:39:58,059
I'm earning my keep.

682
00:39:58,161 --> 00:40:00,493
Then every once in a while,

683
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:03,293
I think...

684
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:05,390
No.

685
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:08,937
This is something else.

686
00:40:09,038 --> 00:40:11,472
I don't want my husband to see this.

687
00:40:13,242 --> 00:40:16,234
I love to be looked at that way.

688
00:40:20,149 --> 00:40:21,514
You should get out of here.

689
00:40:21,618 --> 00:40:23,381
Nap time is about to end.

690
00:40:25,755 --> 00:40:27,552
Well, I'm just glad you're okay.

691
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,221
We haven't gone over the Nixon plan.

692
00:40:36,332 --> 00:40:37,799
You prepared, right?

693
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,629
In what way?

694
00:40:39,736 --> 00:40:40,930
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

695
00:40:41,037 --> 00:40:42,937
Mr. Sterling, Mr. Draper,
I'm waiting for service.

696
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:44,870
So am I. What are you talking about?

697
00:40:44,974 --> 00:40:46,134
We're out of order.

698
00:40:46,242 --> 00:40:48,642
Oh, crap.

699
00:40:48,745 --> 00:40:50,804
When will they be back up?
Should we wait?

700
00:40:50,913 --> 00:40:52,881
We've got our best man on it.

701
00:40:52,982 --> 00:40:55,644
That's a comfort.

702
00:40:55,752 --> 00:40:57,686
Jesus, we're already late.

703
00:40:57,787 --> 00:40:59,277
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Sterling.

704
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:01,914
It's certainly a believable excuse.

705
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:03,356
We could go back to lunch.

706
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:07,657
No. Cooper would have a seizure,
if he hasn't already.

707
00:41:07,764 --> 00:41:09,732
So?

708
00:41:35,324 --> 00:41:37,087
Ah, this is ridiculous. A building this big.

709
00:41:37,193 --> 00:41:38,353
What if there was a fire?

710
00:41:38,461 --> 00:41:40,986
We'd be walking down.

711
00:41:41,097 --> 00:41:42,223
It would be easier.

712
00:41:54,977 --> 00:41:56,239
Maybe we should check the elevator.

713
00:41:56,345 --> 00:41:57,573
Maybe it's up again.

714
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,547
I think we'd hear it go on in the stairwell.

715
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,844
You think?

716
00:42:01,951 --> 00:42:03,782
Roger, I don't know.

717
00:42:03,886 --> 00:42:06,184
Maybe they're late, too.

718
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:08,052
Maybe we could get them to come down

719
00:42:08,157 --> 00:42:10,182
and have the presentation
on the eighth floor landing.

720
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:11,191
There's plenty of seats.

721
00:42:11,294 --> 00:42:12,454
Damned elevator.

722
00:42:12,562 --> 00:42:14,689
What do you want to do?
We're almost there.

723
00:42:14,797 --> 00:42:16,094
The hell we are.

724
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:19,635
Well, we can waste another five minutes
talking about it, if you want.

725
00:42:19,736 --> 00:42:21,169
Let's go.

726
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,706
Get behind me with that thing.

727
00:42:41,824 --> 00:42:43,086
Six to go.

728
00:42:43,192 --> 00:42:44,989
I've been counting.

729
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,561
You want to rest a minute?

730
00:42:48,664 --> 00:42:52,031
No, sir. No, I don't.

731
00:42:52,135 --> 00:42:53,932
Keep moving.

732
00:42:54,036 --> 00:42:56,630
I forgot. Navy man.

733
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:10,547
I love redheads.

734
00:43:11,921 --> 00:43:13,115
With big breasts.

735
00:43:13,222 --> 00:43:15,986
We'll find you one if we still have jobs.

736
00:43:16,092 --> 00:43:18,424
Want me to run ahead?

737
00:43:18,528 --> 00:43:20,621
Run?

738
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,960
My name's on the building.

739
00:43:23,065 --> 00:43:24,623
They can wait for me.

740
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,167
I got to stop talking.

741
00:43:45,955 --> 00:43:47,445
I'm fine.

742
00:43:47,557 --> 00:43:49,525
Just lost my tie clip.

743
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:50,853
I'll find it. Go on.

744
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,949
You sure?

745
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:54,427
I said go on.

746
00:44:05,975 --> 00:44:07,602
Found it!

747
00:44:25,261 --> 00:44:27,661
- Where the hell were you?
- Elevator's out.

748
00:44:27,763 --> 00:44:29,390
- That's quite a hike. Where's Sterling?
- He's coming.

749
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,095
Well, here are the troops now.

750
00:44:33,202 --> 00:44:35,534
Lou, Michael, Charlie, uh, Don Draper.

751
00:44:35,638 --> 00:44:36,536
Hey, Don.

752
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:38,402
Our creative muscle.

753
00:44:38,507 --> 00:44:40,407
Hopefully, a little brains, too.

754
00:44:40,509 --> 00:44:41,840
Sorry to keep you fellas waiting.

755
00:44:41,944 --> 00:44:43,434
The elevator's out.

756
00:44:43,546 --> 00:44:44,945
Pete Campbell, of course.

757
00:44:45,047 --> 00:44:46,139
We've spoken on the phone.

758
00:44:46,249 --> 00:44:47,546
Yeah, yeah.

759
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:51,108
He'll continue handling things for you.

760
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,950
And when I say handling,
I mean he runs everything by me.

761
00:44:57,126 --> 00:45:01,927
And, of course, uh,
my partner, Roger Sterling.

762
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:05,630
We heard the elevator's down.

763
00:45:05,735 --> 00:45:08,260
Those boys over at United Fruit

764
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:11,135
talk about you like you
invented the damn banana.

765
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:13,933
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

766
00:45:17,914 --> 00:45:19,074
You all right, Roger?

767
00:45:19,181 --> 00:45:21,342
Get us some ice water.

768
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:22,849
Oysters.

769
00:45:22,952 --> 00:45:24,943
I can see that.

770
00:45:25,054 --> 00:45:27,887
23 floors.

771
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,582
I'm just sorry I missed this lunch.

772
00:45:29,692 --> 00:45:31,819
We were with some Quakers.
Had cottage cheese.

773
00:45:31,928 --> 00:45:34,988
Well, let's let Roger regroup.

774
00:45:35,097 --> 00:45:36,029
- Okay.
- Yeah.

775
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:37,759
This way.

776
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:39,562
I'll be right in.

777
00:45:49,378 --> 00:45:50,538
You okay?

778
00:45:55,484 --> 00:45:57,111
Yeah.

779
00:45:57,219 --> 00:45:58,846
Fine.

780
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:02,985
Good.
