1
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:43,839
<i>H- How fast were you going
when Mr. Adams jumped from the car?</i>

2
00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:48,771
<i>75?</i>

3
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:52,951
<i>And... And where was that?</i>

4
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:54,712
<i>L- In your driveway?</i>

5
00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:00,684
<i>H- How far had Mr. Adams
gotten in the lesson?</i>

6
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:02,623
<i>B- Backing out?</i>

7
00:01:05,163 --> 00:01:07,393
It's not Lenny Bruce, but it's good.

8
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:08,898
This is better. It's funny.

9
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,526
This guy used to be an accountant.
Did you know that?

10
00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:12,831
Really?

11
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:14,337
He's not anymore, is he?

12
00:01:16,074 --> 00:01:18,770
Your wife is here, Mr. Campbell.

13
00:01:18,877 --> 00:01:20,071
Thank you, Hildy.

14
00:01:20,178 --> 00:01:22,339
Lunch date. Good idea.

15
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:24,347
You married folks.

16
00:01:24,449 --> 00:01:26,508
Must be nice to spend
some time together.

17
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:30,444
Hello, lovely.

18
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:32,716
You can do better than that.

19
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:34,519
Trudy, you know the fellas:

20
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:36,526
Ken, Paul, and Harry, of course.

21
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:38,562
You'll notice only men coming out of there.

22
00:01:38,664 --> 00:01:40,495
I know you all work so hard.

23
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,497
How's Jennifer?

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,158
Good. Swell, actually,

25
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:45,065
considering she's still
at the phone company.

26
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,296
Nothing I can do.

27
00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:49,169
That's not true.
You could give her a baby.

28
00:01:49,274 --> 00:01:51,003
You'll all in on it together.

29
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:53,669
Nice to see you all again.

30
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:56,378
Do we have a lunch date?

31
00:01:56,481 --> 00:01:58,779
Because Hildy,
she can show you the book.

32
00:01:58,884 --> 00:02:00,875
No, but I'm taking you away.

33
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:03,887
Trudy, I don't think
taking you to lunch is part of my job.

34
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:05,217
Do you have something today?

35
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:07,554
No.

36
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:09,490
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

37
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:11,653
I called Hildy
and asked if you were free.

38
00:02:11,763 --> 00:02:14,095
It'll only take a minute, I promise.

39
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:17,362
I'm sorry. It's great.
Where are we going?

40
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:19,869
It's a surprise.

41
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:23,463
Ah, Don, I'd like you
to meet my wife, Trudy Campbell.

42
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:25,202
Don Draper. Nice to meet you.

43
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,175
Congratulations.
You're a very lucky girl.

44
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:30,112
I know. Most of my friends
can't find a good man.

45
00:02:30,215 --> 00:02:32,308
Believe me. I'm the lucky one.

46
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:34,544
Yes, you are.

47
00:02:38,423 --> 00:02:39,890
He's essential to the process
around here.

48
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:42,551
I think we're almost
as happy to have him as you are.

49
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:45,186
Oh, I don't think that's possible.

50
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:47,231
Well, maybe you're right.

51
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:48,492
Nice to meet you.

52
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,837
He's so nice.

53
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:55,168
Not at all like what I imagined.

54
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:09,381
1,500 square feet.
Two nice bedrooms.

55
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:12,218
I don't know if that
includes that maid's room.

56
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:14,315
Have to be a pretty small maid.

57
00:03:14,426 --> 00:03:15,791
It's on the market for 32,

58
00:03:15,894 --> 00:03:19,421
but Elaine, the realtor,
says we can get it for 30.

59
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:24,969
Lovely, you know that I want
to give you everything.

60
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,595
We don't have to pay
for the whole thing at once.

61
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:28,798
We can get a mortgage.

62
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:31,637
Trudy, I make $75 a week.

63
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:33,574
Now, I know you're not good at math,

64
00:03:33,678 --> 00:03:36,044
but that's $3,500 a year.

65
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:38,082
You'll make more.

66
00:03:38,183 --> 00:03:39,673
Eventually.

67
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:41,582
But if we put 10% down,

68
00:03:41,686 --> 00:03:43,313
that's an entire year's salary.

69
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:46,118
Sweetheart, we're not in this alone.

70
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:50,320
We're a young couple
that needs a little help.

71
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,094
Did you see the sink
in the master bathroom?

72
00:03:58,203 --> 00:04:00,398
It's the same one
they have in The Pierre.

73
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:10,678
Bill it all to Menken's, Fred.

74
00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:12,943
The girl knows where I
keep the accounts.

75
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,322
Hello.

76
00:04:19,424 --> 00:04:20,584
Mr. Draper.

77
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:23,058
Didn't expect to see you back here.

78
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:26,255
Well, we're, uh, screening
a television commercial.

79
00:04:26,364 --> 00:04:29,356
<i>It'll probably look better
when it's breaking up Bonanza.</i>

80
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:32,068
His work is wonderful.

81
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,001
He's perfect for Menken's.

82
00:04:34,105 --> 00:04:35,766
So he keeps telling me.

83
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:40,540
Well, I'll let you see Miss Menken out.

84
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:49,178
How are you?

85
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:50,811
I'm fine.

86
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:52,514
My family is fine.

87
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:54,558
The weather has been spectacular.

88
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,217
Rachel, listen...

89
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:57,659
What are you doing?

90
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:00,555
I don't know.

91
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:04,167
I don't want it to be like this.

92
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:06,931
Yes, well...

93
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:09,563
we both know how we'd like it to be.

94
00:05:09,674 --> 00:05:12,234
Can we at least
have lunch sometime?

95
00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:15,541
I really can't see a reason for that.

96
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,253
"Church bells rang out,

97
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:26,222
"and the air was filled
with flying birds.

98
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:29,122
"What a joyous parade it was
back at the palace.

99
00:05:29,227 --> 00:05:33,220
No king could command
anything finer. "

100
00:05:33,331 --> 00:05:34,559
The end.

101
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,827
The end.

102
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:40,963
Again?

103
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:43,040
Daddy will see you in the morning.

104
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:57,452
Helen, come on. I know you're in there.

105
00:05:59,457 --> 00:06:02,392
Damn it! Helen! Open the door!

106
00:06:07,265 --> 00:06:09,665
Excuse me, Miss.

107
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:12,293
I know you can hear me. Miss?

108
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:17,131
Look, can I use your phone?

109
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:19,608
I'm her husband.

110
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:22,646
I'm supposed to see my kids,
and I know she's in there.

111
00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:24,305
I just called from the gas station.

112
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,146
No. I'm sorry.

113
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:29,584
Are you serious?

114
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:31,781
I'm sure you are who you say you are,

115
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,358
but I don't let strange men
into my home.

116
00:06:35,393 --> 00:06:36,451
Come on.

117
00:06:57,115 --> 00:06:58,275
Can I come in?

118
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:00,044
Of course.

119
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:09,392
I'm really sorry.

120
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:11,689
I'm so embarrassed.

121
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:16,294
I don't know
what you're talking about.

122
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:20,497
Yes, you do. I was at the window.

123
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:24,405
Did you let him in?

124
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:27,571
Yes.

125
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:32,845
He's not a bad man.

126
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:38,480
Do you want some coffee?

127
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:44,394
It's a joke, really.

128
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:47,158
Dan hardly saw the kids
at all when we were married.

129
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:49,699
He works in Manhattan. Life insurance.

130
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:52,964
Now, all of a sudden,
he can't live without them.

131
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:55,471
Of course, if he does die, I'm set.

132
00:07:58,276 --> 00:07:59,334
I'm joking.

133
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:04,671
What happened?

134
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:08,249
I'll tell you exactly.

135
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:10,787
He had a lot of friends in the city.

136
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:15,485
There was poker and tennis,
drinks at the River Club.

137
00:08:15,593 --> 00:08:17,584
Turned out none of them were men.

138
00:08:19,164 --> 00:08:20,791
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

139
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:23,891
I really just meant
tonight what happened.

140
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:26,061
Please, I figure I might as well say it.

141
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:28,162
That's what you've all been
guessing anyway, right?

142
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:30,104
We haven't all been doing anything.

143
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,910
Okay.

144
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:36,275
The strangest part of it

145
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:39,407
is that I think he's angrier
at me than I am at him.

146
00:08:39,517 --> 00:08:41,007
Of course my father got a lawyer,

147
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:43,587
an army buddy who just
hammered the hell out of him.

148
00:08:45,323 --> 00:08:47,291
I've always loved that house.

149
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:56,164
Hello.

150
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:06,273
He has to go right upstairs
and have complete quiet for a while.

151
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:08,641
He works so hard.

152
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:10,271
I should get back.

153
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:12,178
My kids are asleep.

154
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:34,902
Boat's in the water.

155
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:40,611
Your cousin Sara had her baby.

156
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:42,111
Named it after your Uncle Skip.

157
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:43,339
I think that's nice.

158
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:49,917
Everything's all ready in the trunks.

159
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:51,818
We do hope you and Trudy

160
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:54,323
will be making it out
to the house this summer.

161
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:56,985
We'll try, but I'm not sure

162
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:59,393
I'll be able to take
the time off from work.

163
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:03,194
Work? Ha. I still don't
understand what you do.

164
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:05,132
I'd hate for you
to miss the blackberries.

165
00:10:05,236 --> 00:10:07,204
Run into you at the club, you're working.

166
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:09,102
At a restaurant, you're working.

167
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:10,970
Taking people out to dinner,

168
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:13,373
wining and whoring.

169
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:15,036
No job for a white man.

170
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:19,515
She's made such a nice
addition to the table.

171
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:21,414
So nice and appreciative.

172
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,953
There's a lot more to it than that.

173
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,055
Advertising. Really?

174
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:30,389
See, if someone were to tell me
there's a lot more to the law,

175
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:31,689
I'd believe him.

176
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:37,129
I can't explain
how business works to you.

177
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,603
Trudy found an apartment
that she likes.

178
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:43,970
Did she? Whereabouts?

179
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:46,100
83rd and Park. Very nice.

180
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:48,509
Are you sure you want
to be that far uptown?

181
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:49,545
It's not that far, Dad.

182
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:51,512
It falls off after 79th.

183
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:54,983
No, darling. They fall off after 86th.

184
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:57,054
It's a very nice area.

185
00:10:57,155 --> 00:10:58,213
It is.

186
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:02,120
And, well...

187
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:05,060
it's actually kind of expensive,

188
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:10,567
so we're going to need help
with the down payment.

189
00:11:10,668 --> 00:11:12,192
Really?

190
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:14,396
Yes.

191
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,037
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

192
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:23,204
And why is that?

193
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:26,772
I just don't think it's a good idea.

194
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:30,551
You thought it was
a good idea to help Bud

195
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:33,419
when he hit that girl on her bike
in Montauk last summer.

196
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:34,752
What did that cost?

197
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:45,793
I presume it's your profession

198
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:49,237
that is responsible
for this lapse in your manners.

199
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,672
I'll pay you back.

200
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:55,212
It's not about the money, Peter.

201
00:11:55,313 --> 00:11:56,837
You know that.

202
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:03,614
Why is it so hard
for you people to give me anything?

203
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:05,348
We gave you everything.

204
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:08,016
We gave you your name.

205
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:10,594
And what have you done with it?

206
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,737
Did you have a nice visit?

207
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:31,337
They're very keen on us coming out
to Fisher's Island this summer.

208
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:33,417
Can they help with the apartment?

209
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:36,276
I didn't bring it up.

210
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:39,356
My dad's been having
some health problems.

211
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:42,255
Oh, sweetheart.

212
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,055
What's wrong with him?

213
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:48,626
Nobody knows.

214
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:58,442
Walter, how's it going?

215
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:00,067
Never have much luck,

216
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:02,612
unless I'm playing
against Campbell here.

217
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:05,182
Well, he's known for losing gracefully.

218
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:08,377
You know our art director,
Salvatore Romano.

219
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:11,182
Did you have a good time
in the city last night?

220
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:12,381
When I come into town,

221
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,355
I like to do my business and go home.

222
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:15,721
Unwind with the Psalms.

223
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:18,387
No man should have to live
out of a suitcase.

224
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:22,193
So what do you fellows have for me?

225
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,260
Well, we take for granted
the things we need the most:

226
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:31,468
Water, oil, electricity... steel.

227
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:34,010
I was thinking
about the last time you were here,

228
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:37,604
looking out this window
at this incredible city

229
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:41,708
and saying... "It's all steel. "

230
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:44,686
New York City:

231
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:48,748
Brought to you by Bethlehem Steel.

232
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,225
The city of Pittsburgh,

233
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:52,421
brought to you by Bethlehem Steel.

234
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:56,193
The city of Chicago,
Detroit, St. Louis.

235
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,768
Full-page ads in targeted markets:

236
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,963
Newspapers, trade publications.

237
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:02,539
Throw in a few billboards

238
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,200
so your employees can
brag to their girlfriends.

239
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:11,574
They're kind of plain, aren't they?

240
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:15,584
Reminds me of those WPA ads
before the war.

241
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:18,346
Walter, you've been
doing this long enough.

242
00:14:18,456 --> 00:14:20,515
We can throw this artwork
away in a minute.

243
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:25,453
But the sentiment, the idea,
it's so basic,

244
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:27,155
you feel like you already know it.

245
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:29,233
You just haven't thought of it lately.

246
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:33,463
Cities are made of steel.

247
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:35,266
Bethlehem Steel.

248
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:39,400
I might be wrong,
but these feel like ads for cities.

249
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,569
You're making our company

250
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,512
look like a middleman
for another product.

251
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:47,982
Well, would you prefer
an I-beam on a plate

252
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:50,111
with a pat of butter on it?

253
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:52,189
No need to get cute, Don.

254
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,757
Just making a point.

255
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:56,827
Steel is not something
that you can buy at the supermarket.

256
00:14:56,928 --> 00:15:00,159
But it is a commodity.

257
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:01,356
Walter, I'm surprised.

258
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:04,492
I believe this is fairly close
to what we had talked about.

259
00:15:04,602 --> 00:15:06,092
We talked about a national strategy

260
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:09,537
that would involve the virtues
of this essential commodity.

261
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,005
I believe it was more specific.

262
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:13,600
Don, Walter
has expressed himself.

263
00:15:13,711 --> 00:15:16,145
Now, Walter, if this does not meet
your expectations,

264
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:18,340
I'm sure Don can find
something that does,

265
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:19,347
right, Don?

266
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,145
I hate to be a pain in the ass,

267
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:23,777
but if they didn't
just lay there so flat.

268
00:15:23,888 --> 00:15:28,018
I don't know. Maybe it's because
I'm not from a city.

269
00:15:28,126 --> 00:15:31,527
They just... bother me.

270
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,688
Look, if we can persuade you

271
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:35,356
to stay in town
another 24 hours...

272
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,161
back at the St. Regis, of course...

273
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:38,599
it would give us a chance

274
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:40,193
to come up with something
with more impact.

275
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:42,966
Get you tickets to a Broadway show.

276
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:44,837
<i>There's a new one: Uh, Bye Bye Birdie.</i>

277
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:46,705
I don't like birds, either.

278
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:48,711
Well, something else, then.

279
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:52,214
Pete, I think Sal can
show Mr. Veith out. Walt.

280
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:57,944
Sorry about that.
They are good drawings.

281
00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:01,252
No, the WPA was a very respected style.

282
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,986
20 years ago.

283
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,562
What the hell was that?

284
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:12,226
Come on, Don.

285
00:16:12,336 --> 00:16:15,499
That's not the first time
someone's been unhappy.

286
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:16,971
Give it a haircut.

287
00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:19,133
He's a second-time guy anyway.
I could feel that.

288
00:16:19,243 --> 00:16:21,575
And I could feel
he was sentences away.

289
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,271
I'm that kind of guy.

290
00:16:23,381 --> 00:16:24,871
He didn't like the idea.

291
00:16:24,982 --> 00:16:27,177
Someone hadn't prepared him
to like the idea,

292
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:31,085
an idea he was extremely enthusiastic
about three months ago.

293
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:35,057
I'm sorry I didn't lower
his expectations enough.

294
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,922
You do your job.

295
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:39,155
Take him sailing.
Get him in a bathing suit.

296
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:40,662
Leave the ideas to me.

297
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:42,926
I have ideas.

298
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:44,865
I'm sure you do.

299
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:48,461
Sterling Cooper has more failed artists
and intellectuals than the Third Reich.

300
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:51,701
You know what? I have good ideas.

301
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:54,903
In fact, I used to carry around
a notebook and pen just to keep track.

302
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:57,344
Direct marketing. I thought of that.

303
00:16:57,448 --> 00:17:00,906
Turned out it already existed,
but I arrived at it independently.

304
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:02,610
And then I come to this place,

305
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,779
and you people tell me
I'm good with people,

306
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:05,981
which is strange

307
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,490
because I'd never heard that before.

308
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:21,270
Draper residence.

309
00:17:21,372 --> 00:17:24,773
<i>Betty? Helen Bishop. Are you busy?</i>

310
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:28,777
Well... no, I'm just finishing up dinner.

311
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:31,343
Of course.

312
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:36,011
Listen, this may be truly rude,
but I was wondering.

313
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,419
I'm supposed to be stuffing envelopes
at Kennedy Headquarters tonight,

314
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:42,048
and my sitter just cancelled,

315
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:44,593
and I hate to back out
because, well, you know,

316
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:46,959
New York State is so important.

317
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:49,362
I didn't know that.

318
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:50,559
Well, anyway, I was wondering

319
00:17:50,668 --> 00:17:53,034
if you could come watch
the kids for a few hours.

320
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:54,695
Right now?

321
00:17:57,675 --> 00:18:00,303
You know what?
I shouldn't have asked.

322
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,372
Well, let me just get dinner on the table.

323
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:09,510
I guess Don can watch the kids.

324
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,453
Really? Gosh, that would be wonderful.

325
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:14,547
Take your time.

326
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:18,425
<i>Put that lemonade into the floor show.</i>

327
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:20,360
<i>That's a swell ideal</i>

328
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:22,261
<i>But how could we do that?</i>

329
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:27,132
Oh, you're a lifesaver, truly.

330
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:29,866
I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.

331
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:31,202
Hiroshima, I know.

332
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:33,539
Cleaning lady and babysitter are one.

333
00:18:33,644 --> 00:18:35,077
Oh, stop.

334
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:36,908
It's charming.

335
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,177
That's beautiful, Glen.

336
00:18:41,285 --> 00:18:42,616
Except he can wake the baby.

337
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,709
Glen, stop that now.

338
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:45,015
You remember Mrs. Draper?

339
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:47,556
She's going to take
care of you while I'm gone.

340
00:18:47,658 --> 00:18:49,057
No ironing.

341
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,060
Ironing?

342
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:53,687
I give him 5 cents a piece.
He loves doing it,

343
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:55,129
Oh, there you are.

344
00:18:55,232 --> 00:18:58,724
I swear to God, I am so exhausted
when I get home from the jewelry store

345
00:18:58,836 --> 00:19:01,805
that I just kick these off,
and I never know where they end up.

346
00:19:01,906 --> 00:19:04,101
<i>You, Glen Bishop, in bed
after The Real McCoys.</i>

347
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,607
No discussions.

348
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:11,514
You look very nice.

349
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,379
They keep the place poorly lit.

350
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,585
I guess there'll be a lot of nice men there.

351
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,251
Yes. I guess so,
although it's mostly women.

352
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:25,056
Have you seen the candidate?

353
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:27,858
On the news. He's handsome.

354
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:30,229
But I'm not sure who we're voting for.

355
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:32,802
Well, I'll bring you back
some literature.

356
00:19:32,903 --> 00:19:34,461
I'll be back before 10, I promise.

357
00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:35,539
Glen.

358
00:19:55,226 --> 00:19:57,251
You got to get
that Lux soap campaign

359
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:58,692
over to Sterling Cooper.

360
00:19:58,796 --> 00:20:00,889
Janet Leigh and Natalie Wood...

361
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:02,556
now, there's a day at the office.

362
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,224
Is that an orange?

363
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:07,702
I'm telling you, you boys,
you've got it made.

364
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:08,931
Martini lunches,

365
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,098
gorgeous women parading through.

366
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,802
In my next life,
I'm coming back as an ad man.

367
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:16,243
Well, there's slightly more to it than that.

368
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:17,974
Yeah? Well, I'd keep that to yourself.

369
00:20:18,082 --> 00:20:19,379
I met his boss yesterday.

370
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:21,246
You should have heard
the nice things he said.

371
00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:22,876
He's not my boss.

372
00:20:22,987 --> 00:20:24,784
Well, isn't that nice?

373
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:26,914
To be appreciated for what you do?

374
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,827
We have some great news.

375
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:32,657
Already?

376
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:35,789
Honestly, you two. It's not that.

377
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,697
We found an apartment.

378
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:40,862
Oh. Well, that's exciting, too.

379
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:42,063
Yes, well, unfortunately,

380
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:44,403
it's a bit out of our
price range right now.

381
00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:45,805
I've been looking in the neighborhood,

382
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,571
and it seems very well priced to me:

383
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:50,010
32, but the realtor says
we can get it for 30.

384
00:20:50,114 --> 00:20:51,513
- Around here?
- 83rd, but...

385
00:20:51,615 --> 00:20:53,708
- How many rooms?
- Five:

386
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:55,115
Two bedrooms, two baths, a terrace.

387
00:20:56,954 --> 00:20:58,114
I don't know.

388
00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:00,713
I'd have to look at it first.

389
00:21:06,897 --> 00:21:07,761
Oh, thank you.

390
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:09,662
Sir...

391
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:11,826
I'll take Tom or Dad, you got me?

392
00:21:13,537 --> 00:21:17,564
Tom, it's very generous
for you to even consider it,

393
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:20,508
but I think we'd rather wait.

394
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:23,339
For what?

395
00:21:23,447 --> 00:21:24,675
Start your life already.

396
00:21:24,782 --> 00:21:26,340
You're gonna be a rich bastard
on your own someday,

397
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,917
and waiting's a bunch of bullshit.

398
00:21:28,018 --> 00:21:29,576
- Tomcat.
- It is.

399
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:30,984
Your confidence is really...

400
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:32,919
well, it's swell.

401
00:21:33,023 --> 00:21:35,958
But honestly,
I'm not sure it's a good idea.

402
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,152
I am.

403
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:41,459
Pete, this is an investment
for me, in you.

404
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,964
And my jellybean over here, of course.

405
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,972
Oh, thank you. You're gonna love it.

406
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,775
We'll be so happy there.

407
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:13,688
I knew they'd help us.

408
00:22:13,797 --> 00:22:15,628
I know you did.

409
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:17,667
Oh, come on.

410
00:22:17,768 --> 00:22:20,168
You can't possibly be angry with me.

411
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:25,572
I'm just not sure taking that kind
of money is a good idea.

412
00:22:25,676 --> 00:22:27,371
He's not paying for the whole thing.

413
00:22:27,478 --> 00:22:28,877
It's still a lot of money,

414
00:22:28,979 --> 00:22:30,571
and I'm not sure what it means.

415
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:34,742
It means
we get the apartment.

416
00:22:34,852 --> 00:22:37,787
Do they get to tell us
where to put the furniture?

417
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:40,220
They're not like that.

418
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:42,554
You would have taken
money from your parents.

419
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,558
That's different.

420
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:44,559
Why?

421
00:22:44,662 --> 00:22:46,527
Because that's my money.

422
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,722
I'll get it eventually.

423
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:49,958
So this is my money.

424
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:53,298
Sweetheart, he wants to help.

425
00:22:53,404 --> 00:22:54,837
It makes him feel good.

426
00:22:54,939 --> 00:22:56,167
Well, what about me?

427
00:22:56,273 --> 00:22:57,831
Well, what about me?

428
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:02,807
You always get
what you want, don't you?

429
00:23:02,913 --> 00:23:07,316
I got you. That's all I really wanted.

430
00:23:10,254 --> 00:23:13,121
Excuse me.
Can we turn up Park?

431
00:23:13,223 --> 00:23:15,088
I need to meet a client downtown.

432
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:18,161
Hush. It'll only take a sec.

433
00:23:18,262 --> 00:23:20,230
The Armory.

434
00:23:20,331 --> 00:23:23,391
When are they gonna
tear that dinosaur down?

435
00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:47,183
I'll be right back.

436
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,785
I'm in here.

437
00:24:52,656 --> 00:24:54,715
Glen, I said get out.

438
00:24:57,828 --> 00:24:59,819
Young man, what is wrong with you?

439
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:00,954
This room is occupied.

440
00:25:14,712 --> 00:25:17,306
What do you have to say for yourself?

441
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:21,715
Glen, look at me.

442
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:23,912
That was very bad.

443
00:25:26,957 --> 00:25:30,017
You know better than to walk in
on someone like that.

444
00:25:30,127 --> 00:25:34,291
That room is private, extremely private.

445
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:39,263
Well, that's all I'm trying to say.

446
00:25:40,504 --> 00:25:42,165
Now look at me.

447
00:25:44,508 --> 00:25:47,102
Don't you think
you owe me an apology?

448
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,906
Well?

449
00:25:51,014 --> 00:25:53,039
I'm sorry.

450
00:25:54,551 --> 00:25:56,018
Well, good.

451
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,351
That's not the way to behave, okay?

452
00:26:05,596 --> 00:26:07,427
Now...

453
00:26:07,531 --> 00:26:11,592
It's all right. I'm not angry anymore.

454
00:26:22,146 --> 00:26:24,808
You're pretty.

455
00:26:27,618 --> 00:26:28,846
Well, thank you, dear.

456
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:31,477
Really pretty.

457
00:26:31,588 --> 00:26:35,456
That's sweet of you to say.

458
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:38,289
How old are you?

459
00:26:38,395 --> 00:26:43,196
Well, I'm the same age
as your mother.

460
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,790
How old is your mother?

461
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:46,164
She's 32.

462
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,238
I'm 28.

463
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:55,073
Your hair is so beautiful.
You look like a princess.

464
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:57,773
Well, I don't know about that.

465
00:26:57,881 --> 00:26:59,178
Can I have some?

466
00:26:59,283 --> 00:27:00,511
What?

467
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:04,178
Can I have some of your hair?

468
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,324
Glen, no.

469
00:27:08,425 --> 00:27:09,449
Just a little piece?

470
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,822
Glen.

471
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:12,725
You won't even miss it.

472
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:38,587
Now off to bed with you.

473
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,857
And no radio.

474
00:28:04,615 --> 00:28:06,173
Evening, gentlemen.

475
00:28:07,284 --> 00:28:09,013
Walter, I'd like you to meet my cousins

476
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,051
Charlotte and Wendy.

477
00:28:10,153 --> 00:28:12,986
Ladies, it's a pleasure.

478
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,615
We were hoping
you were Pete's friends.

479
00:28:15,726 --> 00:28:17,387
You must be the man of steel.

480
00:28:17,494 --> 00:28:19,086
Will you look at that?

481
00:28:19,196 --> 00:28:22,359
You could lose a nickel
in those dimples.

482
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:27,163
I thought your cousin
Wendy was a redhead.

483
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:29,364
No, that's my cousin Doris.

484
00:28:29,473 --> 00:28:31,441
She wasn't available this evening.

485
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:34,704
Well, I think we can make do
with this branch of the family.

486
00:28:36,747 --> 00:28:38,806
I'm glad you decided to stay over.

487
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:40,178
So am I.

488
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:44,812
Hey, bottle of champagne for the table
and another round of these, plus one.

489
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:55,465
You know, I had some thoughts
about your campaign today.

490
00:28:55,565 --> 00:28:56,930
Did you?

491
00:28:57,034 --> 00:29:01,994
Well, I was trying to express
the essentialness of steel,

492
00:29:02,105 --> 00:29:05,973
and I thought, Bethlehem Steel:

493
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:08,442
The backbone of America.

494
00:29:08,545 --> 00:29:10,137
What do you think?

495
00:29:10,247 --> 00:29:14,479
Unbelievable. Did Draper tell you
to try and sneak this one by me?

496
00:29:14,584 --> 00:29:15,642
No. I was just...

497
00:29:15,752 --> 00:29:17,447
Campbell, get off the clock.

498
00:29:17,554 --> 00:29:21,081
We have two lovely ladies here.

499
00:29:21,191 --> 00:29:26,026
The only backbone
I'm interested in now is right here.

500
00:29:27,397 --> 00:29:30,764
So, tell me, Wendy, what do you do

501
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:34,598
when you're not
lighting up rooms with your smile?

502
00:29:34,705 --> 00:29:37,697
Well, I'm an actress,
and I take some classes at Hunter.

503
00:29:37,808 --> 00:29:39,241
Do you?

504
00:29:39,343 --> 00:29:43,302
I would have thought you slept all day
and bathed in milk.

505
00:29:57,627 --> 00:29:59,595
How was it?

506
00:29:59,696 --> 00:30:03,063
It was nice. Very quiet.

507
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:05,532
Oh. In case you're interested.

508
00:30:05,635 --> 00:30:08,536
Oh. Thank you.

509
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:10,902
I'll be sure to look at it.

510
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:12,066
I can't thank you enough.

511
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:14,166
I hope I can return the favor sometime.

512
00:30:14,277 --> 00:30:17,474
Oh, please, don't even think about it.

513
00:30:59,556 --> 00:31:02,423
Looks pretty familiar.

514
00:31:02,526 --> 00:31:06,155
Well, I wanted to maintain
our original strategy,

515
00:31:06,263 --> 00:31:08,823
but I think the wordplay achieves
what you're looking for:

516
00:31:08,932 --> 00:31:10,593
The idea that from the acorn...

517
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,497
that is, Bethlehem Steel...

518
00:31:12,602 --> 00:31:14,570
comes America's great cities.

519
00:31:14,671 --> 00:31:17,265
I know this isn't the idea
you want to sell me,

520
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:19,001
so don't sell it so damn well.

521
00:31:20,844 --> 00:31:22,243
Excuse me?

522
00:31:22,345 --> 00:31:24,370
The backbone idea.

523
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:26,813
Campbell pitched it to me last night.

524
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:28,145
I like it.

525
00:31:28,251 --> 00:31:31,084
What backbone idea?

526
00:31:31,188 --> 00:31:34,055
Bethlehem Steel:
The backbone of America.

527
00:31:34,157 --> 00:31:35,920
Wasn't that it?

528
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,728
Oh, right.

529
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:42,321
It's concise, strong,

530
00:31:42,432 --> 00:31:45,765
and frankly, I like that you were
so enthusiastic about it

531
00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:47,837
you couldn't wait to tell me.

532
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,407
Thanks again, boys.

533
00:31:54,511 --> 00:31:55,842
Pleasure to make you happy, Walt.

534
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:58,005
Hope your visit to New York was productive.

535
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:00,083
I'm warming to the place.

536
00:32:07,057 --> 00:32:08,649
Nice work.

537
00:32:08,758 --> 00:32:10,885
I told you I had ideas.

538
00:32:10,994 --> 00:32:12,825
Yes, you did.

539
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:16,057
Good one. Enjoy it.

540
00:32:18,135 --> 00:32:19,727
You know what I think?

541
00:32:19,836 --> 00:32:23,602
I think I did something good,
and you got the compliment for it.

542
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:27,738
Listen, Pete,

543
00:32:27,844 --> 00:32:32,941
I need you to go
get a cardboard box...

544
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:35,210
and put your things in it.

545
00:32:35,318 --> 00:32:36,546
Okay?

546
00:32:46,696 --> 00:32:49,062
You picked the wrong time
to buy an apartment.

547
00:33:02,045 --> 00:33:05,913
<i>H- How far has Mr. Adams
gotten in the lesson?</i>

548
00:33:06,016 --> 00:33:07,916
<i>B- Backing out?</i>

549
00:33:09,252 --> 00:33:10,583
Everybody out.

550
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:12,655
Now!

551
00:33:14,591 --> 00:33:16,525
<i>Uh, did he cover starting the car?</i>

552
00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:19,919
<i>And the other way to stop.</i>

553
00:33:33,843 --> 00:33:35,367
Remember Pete Campbell's last day?

554
00:33:36,446 --> 00:33:37,538
It's today.

555
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:39,046
What happened?

556
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:42,346
While I was breaking my neck
trying to fix the hash he made yesterday,

557
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:44,283
he was at the St. Regis pitching copy.

558
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:46,784
His copy.

559
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:50,219
That little shit.

560
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:24,850
It was hard to see her all alone like that...

561
00:34:26,096 --> 00:34:31,261
supporting herself
with that sad little job at the jewelry store.

562
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:33,427
Frozen food.

563
00:34:34,804 --> 00:34:37,102
I mean, I know
she gets some kind of help,

564
00:34:37,207 --> 00:34:41,837
but still, she looks so exhausted.

565
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:44,505
She tries to put on a brave face.

566
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:02,627
Honestly, I think she's jealous of me.

567
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:06,663
I've seen it before. I was in a sorority.

568
00:35:09,372 --> 00:35:12,864
I mean, seeing happy families all around.

569
00:35:14,077 --> 00:35:15,908
But I don't know what I can do.

570
00:35:16,012 --> 00:35:18,640
I can't just disappear. I live there.

571
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,918
Of course, my real concern
is those children.

572
00:35:27,223 --> 00:35:28,815
I mean, the baby
won't know the difference,

573
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:30,893
but that poor little boy.

574
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:40,992
The person taking care of him
isn't giving him what he needs.

575
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:44,605
You know?

576
00:36:06,262 --> 00:36:08,025
Gentlemen, please.

577
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:14,569
You really love that thing.

578
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:17,538
You were cute back then.

579
00:36:22,746 --> 00:36:25,613
Pete Campbell.

580
00:36:25,715 --> 00:36:26,943
On his way out.

581
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,813
Sorry to hear that.

582
00:36:28,918 --> 00:36:30,886
Can't be avoided, I'm afraid.

583
00:36:30,987 --> 00:36:32,682
I wish I could agree with that.

584
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,787
He's a junior account executive

585
00:36:35,892 --> 00:36:40,488
who brought his own idea
to a client in a bar.

586
00:36:40,597 --> 00:36:41,723
There are rules.

587
00:36:41,831 --> 00:36:44,425
There are other rules.

588
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:48,064
What's the problem?

589
00:36:49,806 --> 00:36:53,264
New York City is a marvelous machine

590
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:57,745
filled with a mesh of levers
and gears and springs,

591
00:36:57,847 --> 00:37:01,874
like a fine watch wound tight.

592
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:03,748
Always ticking.

593
00:37:03,853 --> 00:37:05,514
Sounds more like a bomb.

594
00:37:05,622 --> 00:37:08,352
How much do you know
about Pete's family?

595
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,824
Nothing, except they put out
a mediocre product.

596
00:37:10,927 --> 00:37:14,090
His mother is
Dorothy Dykeman Campbell.

597
00:37:14,197 --> 00:37:16,427
The Dykemans
owned pretty much everything

598
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:18,262
north of 125th Street,

599
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:20,666
which I don't know
how good your geography is,

600
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:23,068
but that's a fair chunk of the island.

601
00:37:23,173 --> 00:37:25,573
So they're rich. So what?

602
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:26,903
Well, no.

603
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,070
Uh, his grandfather dropped it all in '29.

604
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,579
Panicked.

605
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:35,447
Some people have no confidence
in this country.

606
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:38,854
What's your concern, then?

607
00:37:38,955 --> 00:37:42,447
Well, I don't want
Dorothy Dykeman Campbell

608
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:45,221
standing on the dock
at Fisher's Island this summer

609
00:37:45,328 --> 00:37:48,889
talking about how badly
Sterling Cooper treated her son.

610
00:37:48,998 --> 00:37:51,398
I don't think any of us want that.

611
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:52,866
We lose him,

612
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:56,496
we lose our entree to Buckley, DKE,

613
00:37:56,606 --> 00:38:00,167
the Maidstone Club, the Century Club,

614
00:38:00,276 --> 00:38:02,005
Dartmouth...

615
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:05,308
Gracie Mansion sometimes.

616
00:38:05,415 --> 00:38:07,940
It's a marquee issue for us.

617
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:11,111
See my point?

618
00:38:11,221 --> 00:38:13,121
Absolutely.

619
00:38:13,223 --> 00:38:16,021
He's more valuable to the agency than I am.

620
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,285
Don't fool yourself.

621
00:38:17,393 --> 00:38:20,226
There's a Pete Campbell
at every agency out there.

622
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,389
Well, let's get one of the other ones.

623
00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:24,126
You're going to need a stronger stomach

624
00:38:24,234 --> 00:38:28,227
if you're going to be back in the kitchen
seeing how the sausage is made.

625
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:32,440
Thought it was a big watch.

626
00:38:35,011 --> 00:38:37,036
You handle the words.

627
00:38:37,146 --> 00:38:42,015
You know how much
we want you here with us.

628
00:38:42,118 --> 00:38:44,245
No doubt about that.

629
00:38:44,354 --> 00:38:46,652
Don's a big boy, Bert.

630
00:38:46,756 --> 00:38:48,951
Aren't you, Don?

631
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:57,631
Well, thank you, sir.

632
00:38:59,502 --> 00:39:01,561
There you go.

633
00:39:04,374 --> 00:39:07,468
I'm glad we're all better now.

634
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:34,098
What you did
is totally unacceptable.

635
00:39:34,203 --> 00:39:35,261
I realize that.

636
00:39:35,371 --> 00:39:37,430
I want you to be very clear about this.

637
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,098
You were fired. I wanted you out.

638
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:40,573
Cooper wanted you out.

639
00:39:40,677 --> 00:39:43,305
And you would be if it weren't for this man.

640
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:47,144
He thought you deserved another chance.

641
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:50,777
That's right. He fought for you.

642
00:39:50,887 --> 00:39:52,149
I don't know what to say.

643
00:39:52,255 --> 00:39:53,517
Say nothing.

644
00:39:53,623 --> 00:39:56,558
You're here because
of Don Draper's largesse.

645
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:58,957
Thank you. Thank you so much.

646
00:39:59,062 --> 00:40:01,826
Now, I know that your generation
went to college instead of serving,

647
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:03,023
so I'll illuminate you:

648
00:40:03,132 --> 00:40:04,497
This man is your commanding officer.

649
00:40:04,601 --> 00:40:07,900
You live and die in his shadow.

650
00:40:08,004 --> 00:40:09,596
Understood?

651
00:40:11,874 --> 00:40:13,273
I won't let you down, Don.

652
00:40:13,376 --> 00:40:15,970
Jesus, Campbell.

653
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,047
Don't ever say that.

654
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:36,660
I bet daily friendship with that bottle
attracts more people to advertising

655
00:40:36,766 --> 00:40:38,757
than any salary you can dream of.

656
00:40:38,868 --> 00:40:40,529
It's why I got in.

657
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:42,298
So enjoy it.

658
00:40:43,573 --> 00:40:44,767
I'm doing my best here.

659
00:40:44,874 --> 00:40:45,932
Oh, you're not.

660
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:48,567
You don't know how to drink,
your whole generation.

661
00:40:48,678 --> 00:40:50,009
You drink for the wrong reasons.

662
00:40:50,113 --> 00:40:54,277
My generation,
we drink because it's good.

663
00:40:54,384 --> 00:40:56,978
Because it feels better
than unbuttoning your collar.

664
00:40:57,086 --> 00:40:59,554
Because we deserve it.

665
00:40:59,656 --> 00:41:02,090
We drink because it's what men do.

666
00:41:02,191 --> 00:41:03,419
What about shaky hands?

667
00:41:03,526 --> 00:41:06,120
I see a lot of that, too, with you boys.

668
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:09,630
No joke. Your kind with your gloomy
thoughts and your worries,

669
00:41:09,732 --> 00:41:12,633
you're all busy licking
some imaginary wound.

670
00:41:12,735 --> 00:41:14,965
Not all imaginary.

671
00:41:15,071 --> 00:41:16,698
Yeah, boo-hoo.

672
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:22,003
Maybe I'm not as comfortable
being powerless as you are.

673
00:41:24,981 --> 00:41:26,141
Pardon?

674
00:41:30,253 --> 00:41:32,118
You know, you shouldn't
compete with Pete Campbell.

675
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:33,119
I'm not.

676
00:41:33,222 --> 00:41:34,587
Yeah. You are.

677
00:41:34,691 --> 00:41:38,457
Not at a personal level,
but for the world.

678
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:46,093
I don't know.

679
00:41:46,202 --> 00:41:49,569
Maybe every generation thinks
the next one is the end of it all.

680
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,112
I bet there are people in the Bible

681
00:42:00,216 --> 00:42:02,776
walking around complaining
about kids today.

682
00:42:05,755 --> 00:42:09,623
Kids today, they have
no one to look up to...

683
00:42:09,726 --> 00:42:12,388
because they're looking up to us.

684
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:20,459
Of course, if you're not
going to have live-in help,

685
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,095
that back room can be used
for any number of things.

686
00:42:23,206 --> 00:42:26,266
I don't think we'll be having live-in help
just yet, do you, sweetheart?

687
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:28,900
No, I think we'll be
managing on our own for now.

688
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,307
Oh, I'm so glad you could come.

689
00:42:34,417 --> 00:42:36,112
I'd like you to meet
Mrs. Clifford Lyman.

690
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:37,686
She'll be one
of your new neighbors,

691
00:42:37,787 --> 00:42:39,618
and she's on the co-op board.

692
00:42:39,722 --> 00:42:41,883
Of course you know these two.

693
00:42:41,991 --> 00:42:43,356
Where's the nursery at?

694
00:42:43,459 --> 00:42:44,483
Thank you, Tom.

695
00:42:44,594 --> 00:42:46,152
I don't want to hear that again.

696
00:42:46,262 --> 00:42:47,194
Mrs. Lyman, Trudy Campbell.

697
00:42:47,296 --> 00:42:48,820
So nice to meet you.

698
00:42:48,931 --> 00:42:49,955
Well, aren't you darling?

699
00:42:50,066 --> 00:42:51,363
The two of you.

700
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:53,094
A pleasure.

701
00:42:53,202 --> 00:42:55,534
Now, I know I shouldn't ask, but I have to.

702
00:42:55,638 --> 00:42:57,401
Your mother-in-law was just telling me

703
00:42:57,507 --> 00:43:00,567
that your great-great-grandfather
was a farmer with Isaac Roosevelt?

704
00:43:00,676 --> 00:43:01,870
Is that right?

705
00:43:01,978 --> 00:43:04,003
Um, yes. That's true.

706
00:43:04,113 --> 00:43:07,549
That was Nicholas Dykeman, right?

707
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,618
On his mother's side.

708
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:12,517
Can you imagine orchards
on 204th Street?

709
00:43:12,622 --> 00:43:15,022
He's buried at the Church
of the Intercession.

710
00:43:15,124 --> 00:43:17,888
Oh, my goodness.
Wait until I tell my husband

711
00:43:17,994 --> 00:43:19,962
there's going to be a Dykeman
living in the building.

712
00:43:20,062 --> 00:43:21,927
He'll be so thrilled.

713
00:43:22,031 --> 00:43:25,831
Sweetheart, tell Mrs. Lyman
the story about your great-great aunt

714
00:43:25,935 --> 00:43:28,096
getting in that fight
with the British soldier and the Hessian.

715
00:43:28,204 --> 00:43:29,796
You tell it, dear.

716
00:43:29,906 --> 00:43:32,136
You tell it so much better than I do.

717
00:43:32,241 --> 00:43:35,267
Well, I think it was
his great-great aunt,

718
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:37,676
or great-great-great... I'm not sure...

719
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,873
but it was before
the Revolutionary War,

720
00:43:39,982 --> 00:43:42,473
and the Dykemans owned
a large tract of land

721
00:43:42,585 --> 00:43:44,075
just north of Central Park.

722
00:43:44,187 --> 00:43:47,020
Of course, it wasn't called Central Park
back then, but...
