1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,766
I understand, you "re
hungry. I" m coming.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,520
You are being very, very bossy right now.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,760
Okay.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,530
Hey, what"s the date?

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,026
- The sixth. Why?
- Whoa.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,770
Absolutely nothing.
No reason. What"s up?

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,546
Morgan, I need you at the 400 block
at hilgard Avenue as soon as possible.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,616
Gosh, I would love to,

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,936
but, ludo had kind of a gross
thing happen with his driver"s ed car.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,766
Nervous teenager.

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,006
I"m picturing your face right now,
you really Don"t care about this story.

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,866
Point is, he borrowed
my car. I Don"t have one.

13
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,046
So, hop on the bus, okay? Just get there.
I"ll drive you for the rest of the day.

14
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,636
There"s a little 18-pound
problem with that, though.

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,466
Dead man, high profile. I"ll
see you when you get there. Bye.

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,436
You Don"t...

17
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,646
You Don"t hang up on
me. I hang up on you.

18
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,810
I"m coming.

19
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,826
Yeah, no, I get it.

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,826
But if you Don"t wanna take pennies,
maybe you put up a sign, okay?

21
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:05,960
Otherwise Don"t whine.

22
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,010
Don"t be a pill today, okay, bud?

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,430
Look out. Yeah, just
gonna do a quick scooch.

24
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,750
Yeah.

25
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,620
- Good morning, Morgan.
- Yo, partner. Who"s our stiff?

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,866
Weren"t you getting childcare?

27
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,976
You know, I tried to tell you
on the phone that ludo"s at work.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,250
So Chloe will be riding
shotgun on this investigation.

29
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,676
Didn"t answer the question, though.

30
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,956
Marvin price. The Marvin
price. You know who he is, right?

31
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,196
Sportscaster. He called dodger games.

32
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,886
Yeah. The press is gonna
be all over us on this one.

33
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,406
Los Angeles sports fans love this guy.

34
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,066
"The way my dad talked
about charm in" Marvin,

35
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,236
I thought he was my uncle.

36
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,206
He wouldn"t miss a
game the guy was calling.

37
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,556
It was the soundtrack to his life.

38
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,790
Thought he was his uncle.

39
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,216
Me says he died around 5 A.M.
not sure yet if it"s a hit-and-run or

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,210
- it"s a homicide.
- Tell him what you told us.

41
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,706
That dude was murdered for sure.

42
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,356
- What makes you say that?
- "cause the driver hit him once,

43
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,150
threw it into reverse
and ran over him again.

44
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,576
Yeah, I"m gonna agree
with our friend here.

45
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,670
That sounds like murder.

46
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,336
You mind?

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,150
- I"ve got her.
- Thank you.

48
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,966
- Around what time was this?
- A little after 5 A.M.

49
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,586
- You usually collect on this route?
- Yeah, every other day.

50
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,066
So, you said the car
departed in that direction?

51
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,516
Yeah. That way.

52
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,556
I"m gonna borrow your measuring tape.

53
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,906
And did it ever come back this way?

54
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,936
No, and I would"ve known if it did.

55
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,946
It was the loudest
engine I"ve ever heard.

56
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,690
Did you get a make or model of
the car, plate number, anything?

57
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,320
It was a Jensen interceptor.
Majolica blue, maybe "73, '74."

58
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,266
What makes you say that?

59
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,086
James Bond had a Jensen.

60
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,436
He drove an Aston Martin.

61
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,996
Not the later books,
after Ian Fleming died.

62
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,956
I read all of them. And I quote,

63
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,586
"bond felt he was in a low-flying
plane rather than an automobile

64
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,640
as he accelerated the Jensen."

65
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,006
The Jensen interceptor
had a Chrysler v-8 engine.

66
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,106
<i>Loud as hell. Like a plane taking off.</i>

67
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,790
<i>"Also the paint flecks on the
dead guy"s watch are blue.</i>

68
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,596
Majolica blue.

69
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,706
I"m thinking that when
the car hit him the first time,

70
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,986
price tumbled over the hood and
bashed his watch into the paint.

71
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,706
Someone could"ve even gotten
a custom paint job on a us model.

72
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,716
Yeah, but tire tracks are 69 inches apart.

73
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,166
Way too narrow for
an American sports car.

74
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,880
Odds are Jensen
interceptor, majolica blue.

75
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,090
Well, let"s test your theory.

76
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,866
If you"re right, we should find that
Jensen interceptor parked somewhere

77
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,066
in that apartment garage.

78
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,076
Why would the murderer
leave the car there?

79
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,976
A, we"re standing on a no outlet street.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,526
B, our friend here said the car
didn"t come back this direction.

81
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,386
And c, it"s street cleaning day, oz.
That means there"s no cars on the street.

82
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,290
Only place that car could"ve gone
is that apartment building"s garage.

83
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,496
This is a big case, Morgan.

84
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,256
If we Don"t solve it,
we"re gonna get crucified.

85
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,196
So, you said this guy,
price, he was beloved?

86
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,576
Big time.

87
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,910
My dad could do a spot-on
Marvin price impression.

88
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,406
Clean up in isle nine.

89
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,716
Someone just dropped a can of corn.

90
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,810
Guys, over here!

91
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,040
Are we allowed to uncover it, or
do we have to wait for a warrant?

92
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,106
Ta-da. That"s a Jensen interceptor.

93
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,256
That"s very impressive, Morgan,
but you know there"s a process that we

94
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,140
- plates are missing.
- Bumper "s dented. Paint" s chipped.

95
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,576
What you got?

96
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,226
Okay, so, price and
his neighbor, a Phil elko,

97
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,336
they were involved in a
series of tit-for-tat lawsuits.

98
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,236
- Sounds like things got pretty ugly.
- Yeah.

99
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,376
Well, with what"s left of the
day, you and oz go talk to Phil.

100
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,206
Morgan and I will visit Marvin"s
place, and we"ll debrief in the morning.

101
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,136
But do me a favor, Daphne.
Before you head out,

102
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,766
run a little search on our
stolen 1974 interceptor, please.

103
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,936
Will do. No vin, no plates,
it might take a few days.

104
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,270
Maybe there"ll be prints.

105
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,766
- Hey, boss. We got company.
- Yeah.

106
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,736
That"s price's son, Dexter.
He came in of his own accord.

107
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,286
He wants to speak to the detective
in charge of the investigation.

108
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,940
Says he was on the phone with
his dad when he was murdered.

109
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,226
That is everything I could find
on him in a ten-minute search.

110
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,916
Oz, good job. Offer the man some
coffee, put him in the soft room.

111
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,020
- I"ll join him in a couple minutes.
- Yeah. On it.

112
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,096
When I have something, I"ll tell you.

113
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,376
Well, you know how it works,
Jerry. You"ll know when I know.

114
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,230
All right. Later.

115
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,970
Every reporter in town is calling
me with questions about Marvin price.

116
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,276
Are we thinking he was murdered?

117
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,866
Well, the killer ran him over twice

118
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,666
and abandoned the car
in a nearby parking garage.

119
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,316
So, yeah.

120
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,426
- We"re about to question his son.
- And where"s Morgan?

121
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,326
She"s cleaning baby puke out of my car.

122
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,706
She brought her baby to work?

123
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,046
Yes, she did.

124
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,706
- Well, that is a first.
- And hopefully a last.

125
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,126
Ludo"s picking Chloe up within the hour.

126
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,776
All right.

127
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,956
Once you question price"s
son, circle back with me.

128
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,646
I need to give the press
an update, and soon.

129
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,080
You got it.

130
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,766
It"s a Jensen interceptor.

131
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,480
Interceptor.

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,960
Yeah, it"s a British model.

133
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,170
It"s no longer around.

134
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,946
Where"s karadec?

135
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,906
He"s interviewing the
victim"s son in there.

136
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,326
Do you think you can keep my
daughter safe for the next ten minutes?

137
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,010
Suppose so.

138
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,080
Karadec, wait up.

139
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,606
We"re very sorry for your loss, Dexter.

140
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,090
"Charmin" Marvin was a
big part of my life growing up.

141
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,856
That"s very kind.

142
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,966
I know all of la is mourning
him as this legend,

143
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,656
but that"s not who he was to me. To
me, he was the guy who was jamming out

144
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,920
to earth, wind & fire when
he dropped me off for school.

145
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,520
As rocky as our relationship
was at times, I just.

146
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,270
I can"t believe this is the end of it.

147
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,170
Well, let me assure you,
this one"s personal for me.

148
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,090
It"s personal for a lot of people.

149
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,420
Can you tell me who would"ve
wanted to harm your dad?

150
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,420
Tiana Johnson murdered my father.

151
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,846
Who"s that?

152
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,546
She was his live-in "house manager".

153
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,840
Why the air quotes?

154
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,950
My father could never
resist a pretty face.

155
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,370
Last year he made her the
sole beneficiary in his will.

156
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,246
I hear that you were on the phone
with your father when he was struck.

157
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,486
Tell us about it.

158
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,866
I was returning my dad"s call.

159
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,246
At 5 A.M.?

160
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,456
That"s when we chat.

161
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,480
He gets up every morning
before dawn. At least...

162
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,040
He did.

163
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,226
Then he"d go down
to the boulevard diner,

164
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,110
he"d get his newspaper, drink
his coffee, eat his pancakes.

165
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,536
I knew he"d be free then.

166
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,536
Well, what did your
dad wanna talk about?

167
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,980
His will.

168
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,646
He told me he"d made a
mistake putting Tiana in it,

169
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,476
and he was considering
changing it back.

170
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,570
With you as the beneficiary.

171
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,330
Yes.

172
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,000
Tiana must"ve got wind of
this and that"s why she did it.

173
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,550
I knew she killed him the
second I heard the impact.

174
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,060
Before his dying word.

175
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,000
"Tiddlywinks."

176
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,906
Tiddlywinks. Really? Does
that mean anything to you?

177
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,606
A nickname for Tiana maybe?

178
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,226
I have no idea what he meant.

179
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,110
Why did your dad wanna take
you out of his will in the first place?

180
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,576
Maybe because I liked the
theater more than the ball field.

181
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,266
Or maybe because Tiana
had her hooks in too deep.

182
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:27,476
You know, it says here that
you filed for bankruptcy, Dexter.

183
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,856
Your father"s money
could"ve come in handy, no?

184
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,990
If money was a motive for killing my dad,

185
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,570
shouldn"t I have waited
till I was in the will?

186
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,210
Hey.

187
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,466
I wasn"t sure if you were here today.

188
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,296
Yeah. Just, handed
my baby off to her dad.

189
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,150
Don"t wanna brag, but I brought
her to her first crime scene today.

190
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,956
Didn"t let her see the dead body,
though "cause I'm a good mom.

191
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,546
What about you? You coming or going?

192
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,020
Going. I finished nursing
school, I got a job offer last week.

193
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,680
No way.

194
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,796
Last week...

195
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,966
- Last week... I got a missed call.
- Yep.

196
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,556
I was excited to tell you.

197
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,310
Pretty sure I left, like, two more
messages before I got the hint.

198
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,976
No... Not a hint. I wasn"t hinting.

199
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,496
Morgan, it"s... it's okay.
No hard feelings. I get it.

200
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,700
No, you Don"t get it.

201
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,126
You Don "t get it" cause no one gets it.

202
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:30,050
I-I-I wasn"t trying to ignore
you. I-I just didn"t return the...

203
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,190
I"m just focused on other
stuff, so it makes it hard to.

204
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,070
- I Don"t know how to explain it.
- And you Don"t have to.

205
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,176
Okay, well, let"s do something.
Let"s... let's do a picnic.

206
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,556
Do people still do picnics?

207
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,440
You know, we get the tray of
fruit and some cubed meats.

208
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,100
Eat on the ground. That sounds
fun, right? Let me do that. I"ll do that.

209
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,156
That sounds nice. But I"m
leaving tomorrow morning.

210
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,740
My nursing job"s at San Diego general.

211
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,460
San Diego is very far away.

212
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,980
It is.

213
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:17,440
Okay. Well, congratulations.
You worked really hard.

214
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,480
Thanks.

215
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,760
I"m sorry.

216
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,970
- Morgan, you ready?
- Yeah.

217
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,706
I gotta go.

218
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,490
Yeah. Me too.

219
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,640
Hey, Morgan.

220
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,540
You know, San Diego"s not that far.

221
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,180
That must be price"s home.

222
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,910
You think?

223
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,926
You know, it"d be nice if elko was
the owner of a 1974 Jensen interceptor.

224
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,810
He"s not. Karadec
had me check already.

225
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,540
Well, hello.

226
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,076
- Phil elko?
- Yeah.

227
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,696
Lev ozdil. Daphne forrester.
We"re detectives with the LAPD.

228
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,410
You here about Marvin or Ringo?

229
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,210
Marvin price. Your murdered neighbor.

230
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,070
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

231
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,916
Are you sure I can"t get you anything?

232
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,816
No. How did you hurt your foot?

233
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,880
Skiing accident.

234
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,260
Okay, I did not like Marvin, and
I"m sure you already know that.

235
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,446
- Well, you two liked suing each other.
- Tell us about those lawsuits.

236
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,570
Let"s see.

237
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,136
- His dog instigated the first one.
- His dog?

238
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,866
Son of a bitch wouldn"t
stop barking. Day and night.

239
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,666
I complained so many times
and Marvin did nothing about it.

240
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,326
When the dog died, Marvin said
he found downers in a doggie treat.

241
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,186
Said I was responsible.

242
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,946
And were you?

243
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:22,576
Look, I did not lament the dog"s
passing, but I was not responsible for it.

244
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,856
After that, Marvin sues,

245
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,570
and if that wasn"t enough
for the old bastard... follow me.

246
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,270
Check it out.

247
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,346
- What are we looking at?
- Exactly.

248
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,176
This used to be a
spectacular city lights view

249
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,930
until Marvin planted those
giant trees in front of his house.

250
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,016
Now it"s a view of next to nothing.

251
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,426
Those trees look dead.

252
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,736
- Guess what Marvin claimed.
- What?

253
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,436
He said he found copper
nails hammered into them,

254
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,530
and he tried to blame me.

255
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,986
Mr. Elko, where were
you at 5:00 this morning?

256
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,600
Here, in bed. Like a normal person.

257
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,716
Can anyone vouch for you?

258
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,500
I did have company.
I"ll give you her number.

259
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,076
Feels weird being here.
Marvin price"s home.

260
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,410
You know, my dad ran into him
one time at this fish place on the pch.

261
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,216
He works up the nerve to ask
Marvin for an autograph, right?

262
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,846
He gets the autograph,
and Marvin stood there

263
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,116
and talked to my old
man for, like, ten minutes.

264
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,800
Really gave him the time of day.

265
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,080
See what I mean? The man was loved.

266
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,330
Miss Johnson? LAPD.

267
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,710
No, I"m Mr. Price's housekeeper.

268
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,330
Come in.

269
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,030
Detectives, welcome.

270
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,806
Where would you like to talk?

271
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,970
Anywhere you feel
comfortable, miss Johnson.

272
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,280
The den, I think.

273
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,776
Marcella, I-I can"t find my phone.
Would you mind looking for it for me?

274
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,840
- Of course.
- Thank you.

275
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,630
This way.

276
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,626
Gorgeous house.

277
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,526
Marvin was very particular
about that sort of thing.

278
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,766
Do you mind if I grab a water?

279
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,900
Help yourself.

280
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,390
Wow.

281
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,156
Hey, this is right after kirk Gibson"s
big home run in the "88 series, right?

282
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,476
Marvin loved talking about that game.

283
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,670
You a baseball fan?

284
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,230
Not really. I was a good listener and,
well, Marvin, he loved to tell stories.

285
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,036
So, what can I help you with?

286
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,690
Well, why Don"t you tell us about
your relationship with Marvin?

287
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,240
I oversee the smooth
running of the house.

288
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,170
But that"s not really what
you wanna know, is it?

289
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,520
You wanna know if I
was sleeping with him.

290
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,050
No, Marvin was not my lover.

291
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,260
But I loved the man.

292
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,740
He was like a second father to me.

293
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,470
Did Marvin want more
out of the relationship?

294
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,750
Probably.

295
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,060
But he never said so out loud.

296
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,610
Did you know he made you
the sole beneficiary in his will?

297
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,976
Yeah, I did.

298
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,356
Do you think it"s strange,
given your platonic relationship,

299
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,046
that he named you beneficiary
when he has a living son.

300
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,040
Who, Dexter?

301
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,110
That"s who you should be talking to.

302
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,940
Marvin said he hit the
roof when he told him.

303
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,630
He was always coming
to Marvin for money.

304
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,810
Where were you at 5:00 A.M.?

305
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,810
You know, here, in bed. Alone.

306
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,576
So, no alibi?

307
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,950
I never learned to drive.

308
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,106
Did Marvin ever mention
anything to you about the possibility

309
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,510
of removing you from the
will and putting Dexter back in?

310
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,410
No.

311
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,370
But I wouldn"t have cared if he did.

312
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,170
That"s not why he was important to me.

313
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,970
Do you have any idea why "tiddlywinks"
would have been his last word?

314
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,140
No clue.

315
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,360
Tiana had to be sleeping with price.

316
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,980
I Don"t think so.

317
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,236
In a healthy man ready
for a roll in the hay,

318
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,926
<i>"blood" s gotta travel to all
the necessary body parts.</i>

319
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,996
Boy. Price was on blood thinners

320
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,656
<i>and antidepressants.</i>

321
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,090
<i>That combo is gonna keep a 70-year-old
man from any bedroom shenanigans.</i>

322
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,700
I did get the sense she
really loved him though.

323
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,696
There was a sack lunch in
the fridge with a little heart

324
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,936
<i>that dotted the "I" in Marvin"s name.</i>

325
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,596
I Don"t suppose you found anything in
the house that would explain "tiddlywinks"?

326
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,806
- I did not.
- Yeah.

327
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,560
And that"s gonna drive me nuts.

328
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,730
Hello.

329
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,700
I say we take the 101
back to the precinct.

330
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,476
- Morgan.
- We"re gonna save, like,

331
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,786
ten minutes over surface streets.

332
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,250
Morgan, did you take Tiana"s phone?

333
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,926
It was in the couch cushions, okay?
It"s always in the couch cushions.

334
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,030
Honest mistake. It
looks just like my phone.

335
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,106
But now that we do have it, I think
we should take it back to Daphne,

336
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,146
and have her dig around. See
who Tiana"s been talking to.

337
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,666
You are going to take it back to
the house and hand it back to Tiana.

338
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,970
It"s inadmissible. Come on.

339
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,670
How"d it go with Tiana?

340
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,206
I Don"t think she killed Marvin.

341
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,546
So where is this guy?

342
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,176
You didn"t need to come,
Morgan. I can talk to him.

343
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,836
I understand that, but if this
gio person knows anything about

344
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,020
what happened to Roman, I
really wanna hear it myself.

345
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,580
Okay?

346
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,696
Well, the question is: Will
he tell us what he knows?

347
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,520
And right now, I"m starting
to wonder if he"ll even show.

348
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,876
Is that him?

349
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,010
I"ll take the lead.

350
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,570
So, what"s good here?

351
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,506
You tell us.

352
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,400
Well, I find you can learn a lot
about a place by their pancakes.

353
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,136
Easy to do well, hard to do great.

354
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,276
Well, you can order one
of everything you want

355
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,990
if you have information to help us.

356
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,976
You know why I called.

357
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,426
Yeah, same as everyone else.

358
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,450
You got a problem and
you think I"m the answer.

359
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,280
Roman sinquerra.

360
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,776
That name supposed to
mean something to me?

361
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,046
It should.

362
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,126
You met with him before
he disappeared 15 years ago.

363
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,296
Yeah?

364
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,776
Yeah.

365
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,190
I heard it from multiple sources.
Gonna tell me I"m wrong?

366
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,160
I mean, maybe I met
this guy, maybe I didn"t.

367
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,850
I mean, 15 years is a long time ago,
and sorry, my memory"s not that good.

368
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
I think it is.

369
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,480
Where were you 15 years ago,
hell, where were you 15 days ago?

370
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,280
Fifteen days ago, that was a Tuesday.
I, for one, was at a hardware store.

371
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,706
They were having a sale
on energy-efficient light bulbs.

372
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,226
I saved $3.42.

373
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,056
Out in the parking lot,

374
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,196
I ran over a nail with my car
and the patch to fix the tire,

375
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,886
that cost me 40 bucks, so I
didn"t exactly come out ahead.

376
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:22,446
But more importantly, 15 years
ago, my daughter was just a baby,

377
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,716
and I"m really trying to figure
out what happened to her dad.

378
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,020
So I"d really appreciate it if
you could stop wasting our time.

379
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,520
I have a 16-year-old
nephew. Good kid, smart.

380
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,690
Wants to develop, video games.

381
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,016
Couple of weeks ago he got in trouble.
Got mixed up with the wrong crowd.

382
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,320
Tagged a few billboards
trying to express himself.

383
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,290
Now he"s gonna be charged
with a couple of misdemeanors.

384
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,816
That is unless someone
can help him out.

385
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,756
Well, in order for us to consider that,

386
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,710
we need some assurances
that you actually have information.

387
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,410
You know, I Don"t think there's
anything in this menu for me.

388
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,070
Don"t worry.

389
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,420
I"ll find out what he knows.

390
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,530
Why would Roman be
meeting with a guy like that?

391
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,420
- Hey.
- Hey.

392
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,326
Whatcha doin"?

393
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,940
How cute is this?

394
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,476
I think the brightness is down on
your phone. I can"t see anything.

395
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,570
No, mom, seriously. What
do you think of the car?

396
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,066
I think it"s adorable.

397
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,206
And I think you"re adorable for
thinking I"m gonna get you a car.

398
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,966
I"m literally months away from driving.

399
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,686
We are literally years away from being
able to afford a brand new Volkswagen.

400
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,160
Can we talk about it later?

401
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,750
Sure.

402
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,626
What?

403
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,000
I can always tell when
something is up with you.

404
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,296
I was just going through
some of your dad"s old stuff,

405
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,590
and I noticed that there
were a couple things missing.

406
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,716
I just wanted to look through his
artworks. Sorry, I should"ve asked.

407
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,980
No, it"s okay. Don't be
sorry. You"re not in trouble.

408
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,506
I just Don"t want you to feel like
you have to sneak stuff like that, right?

409
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,160
"cause if there's anything
you wanna talk about, I"m here.

410
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,340
That night when
lieutenant soto stopped by,

411
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,170
I heard her talking to you
about how they"ve found his car,

412
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,270
and they found the diapers
that he"d bought for me.

413
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,660
Baby.

414
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,800
I didn"t know that.

415
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,320
It"s okay.

416
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,800
It made me.

417
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,576
I Don"t know.

418
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,940
It"s okay. Made you what?

419
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,336
Sometimes, the way your brain
works is just super annoying.

420
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,096
But you"re usually right about everything.

421
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,330
So if you Don"t believe
he left us, then neither do I.

422
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,106
<i>Left field is warm and cozy tonight.</i>

423
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,240
<i>Covered in the blanket
known as Felix Jefferson.</i>

424
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,606
<i>The 23-year-old from Mississippi
was gifted the feet of Apollo</i>

425
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,606
<i>and a glove made of... Mom.</i>

426
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,700
Hey, baby.

427
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,126
Did you go to bed last night?

428
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,190
I can"t sleep. I must watch baseball.

429
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,786
Why?

430
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:51,136
"cause pretty soon that man talking
on TV is gonna say "tiddlywinks"

431
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,036
and mom"s gonna figure out
what it means and solve the case

432
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,200
and not have to think about everything
else that"s keeping her up at night.

433
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,146
Tiddlywinks is a game invented in 1888

434
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,960
where squidgers were used
to launch winks into a pot.

435
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,450
I love you, goofball.

436
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,900
- Go make some cereal.
- Okay.

437
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,800
And brush your teeth, good lord.

438
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Detective.

439
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,346
Mr. Price.

440
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,330
I"m sorry to bother you so early.

441
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,656
- Did you get a chance to talk to Tiana?
- I did.

442
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,720
Did you get the impression she had
interest in my dad beyond his money?

443
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,340
I did actually.

444
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:44,070
Tiana said you hounded your father
about money. Is that true, Dexter?

445
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,770
My daughter.

446
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,460
She"s autistic.

447
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,296
We wanted to change schools,
so we could support her needs,

448
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,676
but we couldn"t afford it.

449
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,436
And Marvin wouldn"t help
his own granddaughter?

450
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,940
Kimmy is not his granddaughter.
She"s his step-granddaughter.

451
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,650
My dad and my husband
weren"t on the best of terms.

452
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,580
Is your father still alive?

453
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,160
No.

454
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,790
Did you get a chance
to say goodbye to him?

455
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,030
Tell him what he meant to you?

456
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,270
I did.

457
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,610
When dad was murdered,
we were arguing about his will.

458
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,320
My lasting memory is gonna
be of him calling me a vulture.

459
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,050
Now all I can hope for is
some measure of justice.

460
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,820
Hey, what do we got?

461
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,246
Still double-checking elko"s alibi.

462
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,456
- He has an alibi?
- Yeah.

463
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,650
- And she doesn"t wanna talk to us.
- Why?

464
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,596
She got married six week ago.

465
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,186
Well, smart to double-check it then.

466
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,356
Daphne, any luck on the car?

467
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,596
Well, depending on how far back we go

468
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:57,326
and how big of a radius around la I
use, there"s as many as 16 potentials.

469
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,436
We got novastorm
industries, autophile holdings

470
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,096
and enigma syntech
solutions, lumina core... it"s a lot.

471
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,786
- Well, I get it. Keep digging.
- Yeah.

472
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,886
- Adam.
- Yeah.

473
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,160
You got a second?

474
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,596
Tell me, are you still on good
terms with the district attorney?

475
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,456
Asia?

476
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,806
I mean, it"s complicated.
But, yeah, we"re good. Why?

477
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,520
Good enough to ask for a favor?

478
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,390
That depends. What is this about?

479
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,166
Sixteen-year-old kid who
needs rehab instead of jail.

480
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,166
Who"s the kid?

481
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,546
Nephew of a guy named gio cornforth.

482
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,786
Am I supposed to know who that is?

483
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,486
No. But you will soon enough.

484
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,470
Selena, what the hell is going on?

485
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,796
It"s Morgan.

486
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,146
When she came to work
with us, she asked for my help.

487
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:56,650
We"re finally getting
somewhere, but we need an assist.

488
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,156
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Fine.

489
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,060
Give me all the details you got on
the kid, and I"ll see what I can do.

490
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,640
You all right?

491
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,336
By the time I hear back from the
national insurance crime bureau

492
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,686
and search every corner of
the secretary of state database,

493
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,990
whoever murdered Marvin
will probably be dead too.

494
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,216
Well, how many owners of a
Jensen interceptor have you ruled out?

495
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,046
All the individuals, but some of
these llcs are owned by other llcs.

496
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,006
And without a vin,

497
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,846
the national motor vehicle title
information system won"t help us.

498
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:36,940
Thus...

499
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,630
You know, I know a great
dentist when you need one.

500
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,770
- Wait a minute.
- What?

501
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,926
He was lying.

502
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,236
Who?

503
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,780
Elko. See, the car?

504
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,260
"Autophile holdings."

505
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,400
What about it?

506
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,450
Auto...

507
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,480
Phil...

508
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,800
E.

509
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,356
Phil elko.

510
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,590
Let"s go arrest that son of a bitch.

511
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,196
Philip elko, you"re under arrest
for the murder of Marvin price.

512
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,716
You have the right to remain silent
and refuse to answer questions...

513
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,616
Hold on. What"s going on here?

514
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,716
We found your Jensen
interceptor, Mr. Elko.

515
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,180
The one that you used in the murder.

516
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,950
You found Ringo.

517
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,556
John. Paul. George.

518
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,696
And now you found Ringo.
The band is back together.

519
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,760
Yeah, but Ringo killed your neighbor.

520
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,830
It was stolen a week ago.

521
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,086
I filed a police report and
provided surveillance video

522
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:51,150
the day I got back from Aspen
and discovered it was gone.

523
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,166
You know... I"ve been
mulling over Marvin"s murder.

524
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,506
Have you?

525
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,400
Every time Marvin would
leave town on a team road trip,

526
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,640
I notice this guy on a motorcycle
would pull into Marvin"s garage.

527
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,726
Now, I wanted to be a good neighbor,

528
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,936
so I left him a note letting
him know what"s going on.

529
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,270
She has a boyfriend?

530
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,240
Now, the next time Marvin left
town, the boyfriend shows up.

531
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:20,946
But this time, Marvin was
expecting him. So he doubles back.

532
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,700
Now, I"m guessing he caught
them in flagrante delicto,

533
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:29,956
because two minutes later motorcycle
man came peeling out of the driveway.

534
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,576
Okay.

535
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,090
Spoke to croslen, says he did
take a stolen car report from Mr. Elko,

536
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,410
he just hadn"t entered
it in the system yet.

537
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,640
Did you say you had surveillance video?

538
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,720
<i>The count leads one strike, one out.</i>

539
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,936
<i>If you are what you eat, Ricky
Thomas subsists on escargot alone,</i>

540
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,146
<i>because this man... Mom,
can you turn that down?</i>

541
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,326
I can"t. I'll fall asleep.

542
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:56,730
Yeah, that"s the point of going
to bed. Humans need sleep.

543
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,676
I gotta be superhuman.

544
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,910
No, you Don"t.

545
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,816
Wait. Are you investigating
that baseball guy"s murder?

546
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,756
All the boys at school
are talking about it.

547
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,476
<i>More tiddlywinks.</i>

548
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,610
Tiddlywinks!

549
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,276
D-Did you hear that? He
said it. He said "tiddlywinks."

550
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,686
He said it! He did it!

551
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,920
Yes! Thank you.

552
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,186
Here you go.

553
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,736
Thanks. Keep it open.

554
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,870
You got it.

555
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,026
- Maxwell?
- Yes, indeed.

556
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,460
Really?

557
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,430
What do you want?

558
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,196
Don"t hate the player.

559
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,400
I think its time you
retire that catchphrase.

560
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,726
So, you break up with somebody?

561
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,726
Let me guess, she wanted
to exchange last names?

562
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,130
Damn. Throwing the high inside heat?

563
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,216
I come in peace for two reasons.

564
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,310
Pace yourself.

565
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,146
I have an informant. Slippery.
Can"t quite put my finger on why yet,

566
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,536
but he claims to have a nephew sitting
in juvie that needs to be sitting in rehab.

567
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,630
What"s he dangling?

568
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,300
As far as I can tell, information
on a missing persons case.

569
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,956
Family needs closure. The
kid "s on judge flirko" s docket.

570
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,330
Someone ate their lucky charms.
He owes me and I owe you.

571
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,470
- Text me the kid"s info.
- Will do.

572
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,780
Now, what"s the second thing?

573
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,260
And it better be good.

574
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,270
Hey.

575
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:34,906
I got your text. What"s up?

576
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,706
Karadec got the da to
play ball on gio"s nephew.

577
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,930
Now we just see if we
actually get something in return.

578
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,560
So, we just sit around and wait?

579
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,600
- We wait.
- We"ve got video.

580
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,886
Bring me up to speed.

581
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,306
It turns out the neighbor elko
is the owner of the murder car.

582
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,926
- So, that"s our guy?
- No, not necessarily.

583
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,090
He filed a stolen-car report a week ago.

584
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,330
Can you play it back again?

585
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,386
And this footage is time-stamped

586
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,450
and matches the date
elko says the car was stolen.

587
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,496
It"s possible to alter if you just

588
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,420
our killer"s name is Olivier Dubois
and he works at Hollywood auto.

589
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,266
Did you just Google "who"s the
killer?" On your phone, Morgan?

590
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,926
No, I did not do that, Adam.

591
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,026
I was just watching the
security footage like you

592
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,120
and it"s all on there.

593
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,950
- Explain.
- Okay.

594
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,346
So, when I accidentally
picked up Tiana"s phone,

595
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,440
I saw she was getting a
call from Hollywood auto.

596
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,240
Who would be skilled
enough to hot-wire a car?

597
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,146
- A mechanic.
- Morgan?

598
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,836
Check out the logo
on the car thief"s shoe.

599
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,286
Do you see that distinctive g
logo? That stands for gervais.

600
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,296
It"s a French shoe brand.

601
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,590
- Also the guy is 6 "5".
- How can you tell?

602
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,590
He"s standing against a brick wall.

603
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,856
Each of these cinder
blocks is eight inches tall.

604
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,546
This guy measures up to about
nine and a half bricks, that"s 76 inches,

605
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,440
add an inch for mortar.
That takes us to 6 "5".

606
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,656
It makes sense.

607
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,176
Now, the folks down at Hollywood
auto are so proud of their mechanic staff

608
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,906
that they decide they"re gonna put a
photo of their crew up on their website.

609
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,456
So I asked myself,

610
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,076
"which one of these guys is gonna
go out and buy French sneakers?"

611
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,916
Is it Benito zapata, hans
schmidt, Romeo bonetti,

612
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:27,816
Mustafa bashar, lashawn
booker, or Olivier Dubois?

613
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,956
More importantly, who is sexy Tiana
Johnson gonna take as her lover?

614
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,470
And I"m going with this 6"5" gallic hunk.

615
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,330
My god. Thank you. My god.

616
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,586
Motive?

617
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:49,046
Elko says Marvin price walked in on
this woman he adored but couldn"t have.

618
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,496
<i>She is in bed with Olivier. He"s furious.</i>

619
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,596
<i>He tells Tiana, "that"s it.
I"m taking you out of my will."</i>

620
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,846
<i>Olivier, knowing about
Marvin"s feud with his neighbor,</i>

621
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:02,600
<i>steals elko"s fancy British sports
car and runs him over with it.</i>

622
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,956
<i>But Olivier wants us to find the
car. That"s why it was so easy.</i>

623
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,290
Elko is his patsy.

624
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,990
And what about Marvin"s dying word?
Tiddlywinks. What does that mean?

625
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,230
Don"t know. I've heard Marvin say
it, but I"ve not figured that part out yet.

626
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:20,836
All right. Get down to Hollywood
auto. Talk to this Olivier Dubois.

627
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,310
We"ll check it out.

628
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:34,496
Detective Adam karadec, LAPD.
Hoping to talk to one of your mechanics.

629
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,870
- Which one?
- Olivier Dubois.

630
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,026
What he do?

631
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,120
Not sure yet.

632
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,236
- Karadec.
- Can I see that badge again, please?

633
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,330
Yeah.

634
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,170
- Karadec, he"s running!
- Hey! Hey!

635
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,930
Move.

636
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,620
Police, freeze!

637
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,220
Olivier Dubois, you"re under
arrest for the murder of Marvin price.

638
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,306
Okay. Okay.

639
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:24,060
There we go? Team pop.

640
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,820
Yes.

641
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,656
Your boyfriend, Olivier,
claims he was with you

642
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:34,006
at the time of Marvin"s murder,
but that can"t be true, can it?

643
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,636
Because you said you were
alone when we asked your alibi.

644
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:40,280
I mean, he claims he ran from me because
he"s here in the us on an expired visa.

645
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,180
So, were you with him, Tiana?

646
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,460
- Yes.
- Where?

647
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,226
At his place.

648
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,600
Weird. You told us you were at Marvin"s.

649
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:51,126
Look, I-I didn"t wanna bring up Olivier.

650
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,780
I knew he"d be a suspect.

651
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,476
I didn"t wanna get him
sent back to France.

652
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,656
But Marvin did find
out about the two of you.

653
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,036
- True?
- Yes.

654
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,316
How did Marvin react when
he caught the two of you?

655
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,920
He just told Olivier to get out.

656
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,620
He didn"t fly off the handle... No.

657
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,410
He was pretty calm.

658
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:14,326
He just kept telling me that
Olivier was a waste of my time

659
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,536
and that I was meant for better things.

660
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,846
Wait. He said that Olivier
was a waste of time?

661
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,490
- Yeah.
- Did Marvin ever learn Olivier"s name?

662
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,250
No.

663
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,306
Tiddlywinks.

664
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,336
<i>Being executed out there.</i>

665
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,670
<i>"What a waste of time. It" s tiddlywinks.</i>

666
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,470
<i>He"s stretching on the
mound. More tiddlywinks.</i>

667
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,410
A waste of time. That"s how
Marvin referred to Olivier?

668
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,866
Yeah.

669
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,666
"Tiddlywinks" is a word that Marvin used
when he was referring to a waste of time.

670
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,480
On the mound, in the batter"s box.

671
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,596
His last breath, he used to let
us know who his murderer was.

672
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:52,150
This waste of time that you"re
protecting, Olivier Dubois.

673
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,706
Are you willing to go
to prison for him, Tiana?

674
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,870
We are going to prove
that he murdered Marvin.

675
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,810
That makes you an accessory.

676
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,020
After he... He found
the two of us together,

677
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,720
he always referred to
Olivier as "that waste of time."

678
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:21,100
I was by myself the night
Marvin was murdered.

679
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,420
I never saw Olivier.

680
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,560
I wish Marvin never put me in his will.

681
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:32,840
About that will, just a couple questions.

682
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:37,236
This afternoon, my team
arrested Olivier Dubois,

683
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:42,066
a French national, for the murder
of Los Angeles icon Marvin price.

684
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:47,170
I"d like to thank my consultant Morgan
gillory for her stellar work on the case.

685
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,006
I"ll take some questions now.

686
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,766
Lieutenant, did you see the mayor

687
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:54,806
- congratulating you on solving the case?
- Yes.

688
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,970
Can you walk us
through the investigation?

689
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,016
Hey.

690
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,400
Just wanted to let you know that Tiana"s
giving up all claim on your dad"s estate.

691
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,676
She realized it would help her defense.

692
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,250
Did you help her realize that?

693
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,406
Marvin would"ve liked
you. You"re his type of guy.

694
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:17,136
No. Your dad loved you,
Dexter. You must know that.

695
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,610
No, my dad loved Fernando,
Tommy, piazza, garvey.

696
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,270
He tolerated me.

697
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,070
You know I saw his office?

698
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:32,046
Yeah. He had pictures of
baseball legends, like, all over it,

699
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:35,140
but he had this one single
framed shot just right on his desk.

700
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,250
It was you.

701
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,846
It was?

702
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,296
Yeah, it looked like you were
in a play. You had like a crown.

703
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,600
It must"ve been me in...

704
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,470
In Henry the fifth.

705
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,430
That was on his desk?

706
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,610
The only photo.

707
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,510
I"m so grateful I got the chance
to say goodbye to my dad.

708
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:05,800
And it"s so unfair that you
didn"t get that chance with yours.

709
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,520
Thank you, detective.

710
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,870
I hope you feel good
about solving the case.

711
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,630
I do.

712
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,290
I did have some help.

713
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,170
I guess I owe you one.

714
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,790
Only one?

715
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,906
You owe me so many more than one,

716
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,216
so, technically, I Don"t
really owe you anything at all.

717
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,636
So, I owe you now?

718
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,676
Yes. But I"m willing to call it even.

719
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,226
Aw, it"s very generous of you, Morgan.

720
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,800
Seriously though, thank you.

721
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,506
And I"m sorry I didn't tell
you about Roman earlier. I just

722
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,436
no, that"s okay. I get it.

723
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,640
And I understand why.

724
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,306
I mean, you had soto
working on the case, right?

725
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,586
Very smart move. There"s
nobody better than her.

726
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,970
She taught me half of what I know.

727
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,966
But I"m here now too, so whatever
you need, however I can help,

728
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,170
just say the word.

729
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,650
- I will.
- All right.

730
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,650
And Morgan...

731
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:14,730
Be careful.

732
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,350
I did my research. Guys like gio,

733
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,560
they keep guys like me
up at night, you know?

734
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,490
Understood.

735
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,750
Give me a lift?

736
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,316
I Don "t think I" m going your way.

737
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,720
Yeah, you are.

738
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,496
I gotta get home to my kids. So I

739
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,730
it "s not far. It won" t take long.

740
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,560
Look, I didn"t spend a
lot of time with Roman,

741
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,050
but it was enough to know
that he was a good guy.

742
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,570
What do you say?

743
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,860
I"m leaving town for a while.

744
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,420
When I get back, we"ll see
if I got something to offer.

745
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,150
That"s it?

746
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,870
No. It"s gonna be on my terms.

747
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,910
I Don"t want nobody reaching out
to me, especially your cop friends.

748
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,376
The less communication,
the better. Understand?

749
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,856
Yeah. Yeah, it sounds like you got what
you wanted and now you"re taking off.

750
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,300
Got what I wanted?

751
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,440
Lady, we"re nowhere close to that.

752
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,100
Take this next left.

753
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,110
I Don"t believe you.

754
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,956
I Don "t think you" ve ever met Roman.

755
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,050
Yeah?

756
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,020
I know he was afraid.

757
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,856
Not just for himself,
but for his family too.

758
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,190
Yeah. Yeah, who wouldn"t guess that?

759
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,480
Stop right here.

760
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,320
The rams.

761
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,840
Roman, Ava, Morgan.

762
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,510
You guys used to call
yourselves "the rams," right?

763
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,540
He told me that.
