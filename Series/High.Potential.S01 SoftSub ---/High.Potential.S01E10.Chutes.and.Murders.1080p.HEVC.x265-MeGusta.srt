1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,916
Don't you wanna go
down the slide? It's so fun!

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,536
- Someone's waiting, sweets.
- You can do it.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,476
Come on, go down the slide. Go.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,560
Whee!

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,050
Margo?

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,406
Margo?

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,106
- Daddy! Help!
- Erica?

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,890
- Get me out of here!
- Hold on. I'm coming.

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,160
Help!

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,650
My god!

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,566
Her name is Tara foley.
She was also a nanny.

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,326
But we really didn't know her that well.

13
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,196
Do you know of anyone who
would've wanted to hurt her?

14
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,196
I can't imagine. She was so nice.

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,476
Milo, we don't eat grass!
Have some seaweed.

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,886
Well, there was that creepy guy.

17
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,476
What creepy guy?

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,780
Some weird guy who had
been hanging around the park.

19
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,246
As a mom, it's my job
to anticipate all the ways

20
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,836
somebody could die at a playground,

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,100
but stuck in a slide?

22
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,836
- Missed that one.
- Morning, all.

23
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,116
- Morning.
- Morning.

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,496
So, Dr. Forzan, what have you got?

25
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,186
Well, it looks like the victim
died of an epidural hematoma

26
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,466
due to a blow to the
head by a heavy object.

27
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,266
She was attacked in the slide?

28
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,716
I don't think so.

29
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,296
Judging from the shape of the slide,

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,886
the location of the wound,

31
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,476
it's my belief that the
victim was struck elsewhere

32
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,370
and tried to escape her assailant.

33
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,346
She was hiding, lieutenant.

34
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,106
Time of death?

35
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,446
Around 10:00 P.M.

36
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,246
There doesn't seem to be any cctv here.

37
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,526
I'll have Lynn check.

38
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,726
Any guess as to the murder weapon?

39
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,006
It's hard to say.

40
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,906
We'll test the wound
for particulate matter,

41
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,256
but an injury like this could've
come from any number of things

42
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,596
if it was swung hard enough.

43
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,396
I'll have forensics do a wide sweep.

44
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,916
They're gonna have a hell of a time.

45
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,746
There's no place more
laden with bodily fluids

46
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,980
than a playground during flu season.

47
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,576
Got a lead. The victim's
name is Tara foley.

48
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,646
According to Tara's fellow nannies,

49
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,886
a suspicious man who seemed
particularly interested in Tara

50
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,716
was seen hanging around the park.

51
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,136
Any one of them manage to
take a photo of this person?

52
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,896
Unfortunately, no.

53
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,850
Okay, that dinging's gotta stop.

54
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,750
- Morgan.
- What? I'm detecting.

55
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,146
See? Eight unread messages
from someone named Brett Lewis.

56
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,116
"Tara? Tara! You're late. Where
are you? Tara, answer me now."

57
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,770
The last one's a voice memo.

58
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,196
<i>Tara, you're now an hour and a half late!</i>

59
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,546
<i>You better have an airtight excuse</i>

60
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,390
<i>because this is unacceptable!</i>

61
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,920
That would appear to
be her employer. May I?

62
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,236
No emergency contact listed.

63
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,826
No one listed as mom or dad, either.

64
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,556
What? God, it just keeps getting sadder.

65
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,036
This poor girl. All alone in the world.

66
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,556
Spent her last few
minutes terrified for her life.

67
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,280
You can tell by her ballet
flats that she was nice.

68
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,396
Okay, we have to find that man

69
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,806
who's been hanging around the park.

70
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,846
Daphne, oz, go through Tara's phone.

71
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,436
See if you can find any pictures
she may have taken of him.

72
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,886
And look for next of kin.

73
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,396
Boyfriend, girlfriend,

74
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,126
anyone who can tell us
more about Tara and her life.

75
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,956
- Yep.
- Yeah. You got it.

76
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,686
And Morgan, karadec, we
may not be able to talk to family,

77
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,136
but let's at least start by
talking to the one person

78
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,446
she worked for every day.

79
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,826
Find out what he has to say for himself.

80
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,120
You got it, boss.

81
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,416
What murderer leaves someone
an angry message after killing them?

82
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,720
The smart one.

83
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,076
Adam karadec, LAPD.

84
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,350
I'm afraid I've got
some bad news for you.

85
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,630
Poor Tara.

86
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,366
This is such a shock.

87
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,566
So how long had Tara
been ward's nanny?

88
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,016
About four months.

89
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,156
In that time, she'd
become part of the family.

90
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,436
You know, Brett, you seem
pretty angry in your messages.

91
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,716
I mean, did you have a
strained relationship with Tara?

92
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,300
No. Not at all. I'm just a
stickler for being on time.

93
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,066
I wouldn't have yelled
at her had I known...

94
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,206
Can you tell us about
Tara? What was she like?

95
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,176
Oof.

96
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,426
Tara was a sweet girl, you know.

97
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,256
She was quiet and loving,

98
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,566
and liked reading historical fiction,

99
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,560
and watching tiktoks of dance protégés.

100
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,660
Sorry, I'm just trying to
give you everything I know.

101
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,746
Outside of working for us,

102
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,856
she lived a relatively solitary life.

103
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,236
That would explain the lack of an
emergency contact in her phone.

104
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,306
Had Tara mentioned anything
out of the ordinary to you recently?

105
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,446
- No, nothing I can think of.
- No.

106
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,066
Wait, the... there was...

107
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,890
There was that guy
that kept following her.

108
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,006
Tara complained that she
kept seeing the same guy.

109
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,286
He'd show up wherever
she was. Park, coffee shop.

110
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,830
He was often reading a
French magazine or newspaper.

111
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,690
And he had a limp.

112
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,660
I know where to find this guy.

113
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,816
<i>There's only one news stand</i>

114
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,746
<i>that sells French newspapers in la.</i>

115
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,170
<i>And it's across the street
from a perfect stakeout location.</i>

116
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,476
Wow. You really love this diner?

117
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,786
My god.

118
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,400
This is so good. You gotta take a bite.

119
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,796
Eat from the other
side. I didn't touch there.

120
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,516
Morgan, we're on a stakeout.

121
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,346
A key to a good
stakeout is being discreet.

122
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,726
You worried I'm gonna pull a Meg Ryan

123
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,176
and fake an orgasm or something?

124
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,906
That would attract
way too much attention.

125
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,730
I can fake yours, though. Watch.

126
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,426
Impression over.

127
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,900
That's, hilarious.

128
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,576
- That's our guy.
- Really?

129
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,506
Yep. Yeah. It looks like
he's headed this way.

130
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,080
- In here?
- Yeah.

131
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,470
Where did he go?

132
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,176
Okay, he went up there. You stay here.

133
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,690
Okay.

134
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,420
Okay!

135
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,036
Hey, Morgan, it's safe to...

136
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,106
Well, I could tell by
your confident footsteps

137
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,200
that the coast was clear.

138
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,006
Well, it turns out

139
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,656
that our stalker is actually a pi.

140
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,666
Charles lavoie,

141
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,696
aka Chuck the canuck. Former LAPD.

142
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,396
Used to be a detective
in the traffic department.

143
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,900
Just a warning, the guy is a lot.

144
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,730
Okay.

145
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,226
I apologize about the pastrami smell.

146
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,296
You'll get used to it.

147
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,630
Hey, Chuck.

148
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,910
Adam karadec.

149
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,050
I'll be damned.

150
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,726
- And you got married.
- No.

151
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,370
Morgan gillory. We work together.

152
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,726
Anyway, karadec and I came up together

153
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,246
as detectives, you know.

154
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,246
- We were always neck and neck.
- Is that right?

155
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,210
Until I was forced to retire early. So...

156
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,636
Well, Chuck was shot in the line of duty.

157
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,806
- My god. What happened?
- Yeah.

158
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,256
My firearm did discharge
itself whilst in its holster

159
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,536
during a routine traffic stop

160
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,576
causing my metatarsal to shatter.

161
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,196
You shot yourself in the foot.

162
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,676
I shot myself in the foot.

163
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,546
Okay. Hey, can I take a
look at this newspaper?

164
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,910
Yeah. Sure.

165
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,470
<i>Le devoir, from Quebec.</i>

166
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,966
This is the French newspaper

167
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,486
that Tara saw her stalker reading.

168
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,656
What's this all about?

169
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,106
What do you know about Tara foley?

170
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,486
Everything.

171
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,216
- Did you know she was murdered?
- Almost everything.

172
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,170
I had no idea. Poor girl.

173
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,146
Who hired you to follow her?

174
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,086
I place a high priority
on client confidentiality.

175
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,946
But an even higher one on friendship.

176
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,946
- I was hired by the lewises.
- Her employers?

177
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,956
Ward's parents. It's getting messy.

178
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,266
They wanted to know if I saw
anything out of the ordinary,

179
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,786
but I found bubkes.

180
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,670
Did you take any pictures?

181
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,570
Tons.

182
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,966
I shoot raw, my man.

183
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,036
It's my favorite part of the job.

184
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,076
Do me a favor, Chuck. Bring
these photos to the station tomorrow.

185
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,077
Yeah. Happy to.

186
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:03,486
Karadec.

187
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,106
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

188
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,410
Poor girl.

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,566
Why did you stop following Tara?

190
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,946
I was canned.

191
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,496
The client wasn't happy with the results,

192
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,046
which is what they always say

193
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,210
when they don't get what
they were hoping to find.

194
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,830
What were they hoping to find?

195
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,490
They thought the nanny
was mistreating their son.

196
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,656
We didn't expect to see you again.

197
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,580
We didn't expect to be back.

198
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,636
You think we hired a private investigator

199
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,186
to follow Tara?

200
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,666
I'm sorry, but we most certainly did not.

201
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,186
Well, we might have.

202
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,466
What?

203
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,296
Brett, why did you
hire a pi to follow Tara?

204
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,266
I was a nervous wreck
ever since the ordeal

205
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,196
we went through with
our last nanny, Rosa.

206
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,266
What happened with Rosa?

207
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,616
I'm a member of the 90049
parents' Facebook group.

208
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,586
That's the Brentwood zip code.

209
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,306
Six months ago, I see a
post from a concerned mother

210
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,486
describing a horrific event at the library,

211
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,976
where an unattended child
wandered out of the library

212
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,456
and almost into the street.

213
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,496
When I read the description of the child,

214
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,566
I realized it was ward.

215
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,976
It was terrifying.

216
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,086
Yeah, that is a
nightmare. What'd you do?

217
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,196
We asked Rosa about it,
and she ultimately admitted it.

218
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,776
We had no choice but to let her go.

219
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,336
But what does this have to do with Tara?

220
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,886
We hired Tara, and
everything was going great.

221
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,476
Ward loved her.

222
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,446
But then we see another
post in the parents' group.

223
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,236
This time about Tara.

224
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,446
And this time from several mothers,

225
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,556
all saying that Tara
was endangering ward.

226
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,936
We debated whether to believe it.

227
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,276
The post about Rosa was true.

228
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,836
But we talked to both ward and Tara,

229
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,496
and determined that the accusations

230
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,186
against Tara had to be made up.

231
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,596
Ward lit up around Tara in a
way that he never did with Rosa.

232
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,916
And Tara seemed to be
taking excellent care of ward.

233
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,506
I couldn't let it go. I'm sorry.

234
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,080
What did this pi even find?

235
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,770
Nothing.

236
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,816
Can we see these negative
posts about Tara, please?

237
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,260
Sure. I took screen grabs of everything.

238
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,090
Here you go.

239
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,656
This car in a gal seems to
be all up in your business.

240
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,766
Well, car in a is the one who alerted us

241
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,860
to Rosa's misconduct.

242
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,976
Yeah. And then it looks
like she turns on Tara.

243
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,496
Did you reach out to car in a?

244
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,836
I messaged her, but she said

245
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,690
she didn't have any more information.

246
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,606
If you'll excuse me, I gotta stand up.

247
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,676
These pants only have about
a ten-minute sitting time limit

248
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,010
before they become a
permanent part of my body.

249
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,476
So, Jeff, you were totally confident

250
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,996
in Tara's care of ward.

251
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,710
Completely. She was wonderful.

252
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,656
Where did you even find this guy?

253
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,756
The Internet.

254
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,656
I can't believe you hired a pi.

255
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,146
Well, my guess is he wanted
eyes and ears on the outside

256
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,860
since you guys are all
covered on nanny cams in here.

257
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,590
What? Nanny cams?

258
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,736
I used to rely on a very kind
but very senior gentleman

259
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,296
to watch my kids, and
I wanted to make sure

260
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,536
that he wasn't literally
falling asleep on the job.

261
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,800
So I looked into my surveillance options.

262
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,786
You've got the nanny cam clock,

263
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,786
tissue box, picture frame, energy drink,

264
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,236
which I found confusing,

265
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,856
the nanny cam fake toolbox.

266
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,686
Ultimately, I couldn't afford any of them.

267
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:28,580
But I'm finding that Brett
went with the plant, globe,

268
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,480
and the adorable spy robot.

269
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,806
There's a nanny cam in the north pole?

270
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,426
We're gonna need that footage.

271
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,536
- Where were you two last night?
- We were here all night.

272
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,916
Can anyone corroborate that?

273
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,940
- We were on a video call.
- With who?

274
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,986
Lamar Nichols, our couples counselor.

275
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,150
All right. We'll be in touch.

276
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,136
Well, I'll have Daphne
look up carina's address,

277
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,096
track down the other parents
who posted about Tara.

278
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,516
We need to get to the bottom of
this 90049 parents' Facebook group.

279
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,780
Yep.

280
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,580
You know why most
foods are cooked at 350?

281
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,216
The maillard reaction,
a chemical process

282
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,666
by which the sugars are browned
and produce pleasing flavors.

283
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,420
But I think the sweet
potato fries call for 425.

284
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,180
Crap. You're right.

285
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,096
Agh! They rejected me.

286
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,236
I'm trying to infiltrate a
private online parenting group,

287
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,036
so I can chat up some people
who are bullying our victim,

288
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,556
but it seems like they sniffed around

289
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,146
and figured out that we don't exactly live

290
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,076
within the city limits of Brentwood.

291
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,386
We don't even live close enough

292
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,930
to have the same weather as Brentwood.

293
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,776
By the way, my classmate Finn is having

294
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,916
an 11th birthday party
soon, so I'll need a gift.

295
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,660
Awesome! What do you wanna get him?

296
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,910
Ava, what's a good gift
for a boy's 11th birthday?

297
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,916
Ava, do you have any ideas?

298
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,360
Hey, phone face.

299
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,306
Hi. Your brother's talking to you.

300
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,230
I don't know. Elliot's
the only fifth grader here.

301
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,200
Hey, I was super into
legos when I was 11.

302
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,316
My favorite was a toy story 2 set

303
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,966
'cause I had a big crush on Jessie.

304
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,836
You did? I could totally see it.

305
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,246
With her cute pigtails,

306
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,186
and your eyes just
popped out of your head

307
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,706
and your jaw dropped to the floor.

308
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,596
Hey, hey. She seemed nice.

309
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,636
Why don't you go grab your
tablet and you can pick out a set.

310
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,876
Okay.

311
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,460
- Text me again.
- Okay.

312
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,406
That's you when you first saw Jessie.

313
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,616
Did you change your text
tones to say "awooga"?

314
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,540
Only for the texts from you.

315
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,430
I can't believe you.

316
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,130
Me neither.

317
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,696
Hey! You wanna go
through Tara's phone?

318
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,906
That's all you.

319
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,046
Yeah. This place still smells

320
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,496
like cheap floor wax and the scared urine

321
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,186
from the suckers we put away. Whoo!

322
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,606
You must be Chuck.

323
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,016
You got me.

324
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,986
Did you bring the
photos for the foley case?

325
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,490
Indeed I did. Yep. All 1,500 of them.

326
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,096
Yeah, karadec wanted me
to walk you through them.

327
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,786
You know, identify all the key players.

328
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:15,236
But first, I need a chair
with solid lumbar support.

329
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,176
There she is. I slipped a
disc between my l2 and l3.

330
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,656
You know what? I got Tara's phone.

331
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,200
You tear it up with Chuck.

332
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,450
Okay.

333
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,970
Seems like you have some
personal photos mixed in here.

334
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,320
All my photos are personal.

335
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,086
Are you on any of these,
online parenting groups?

336
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,576
Absolutely not.

337
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,476
Don't need some
self-righteous mom telling me

338
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,956
I don't love my kids if I
don't cut their cucumbers

339
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,266
into little smiley faces

340
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,756
before I cram 'em in their lunch box.

341
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,236
Yeah, I would never take you as the type

342
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,136
to anthropomorphize vegetables.

343
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,556
That is the kindest thing
you've ever said to me.

344
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,516
"Warning from a concerned mom."

345
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,216
Ward's new nanny, Tara,
is cruel and neglectful.

346
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,766
Last Tuesday, she grabbed
his arm so hard he screamed.

347
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,876
Then Thursday, she
yelled at him to stop crying

348
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,146
"and left him stuck on the
top of the play structure."

349
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,970
I didn't write that.

350
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,916
It sure seems like you did.

351
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,566
And a bunch of other ones just like it.

352
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,630
I mean, why don't you
take a second look?

353
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,330
Didn't write it.

354
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,336
That's pretty good, but I didn't write it.

355
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,476
Didn't... no, you know,
I did write this one.

356
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,756
Which one?

357
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,516
"At the library on Wednesday afternoon,

358
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,826
a dark-headed boy wearing
galoshes and a conductor hat

359
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,796
was unattended for 15 minutes,
crying and calling for a Rosa.

360
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,906
He ran out the front door
and would've gone into traffic

361
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,456
had it not been for a
quick library staff member.

362
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,326
Finally, Rosa showed up with no excuse.

363
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,946
"If this is your nanny, she is dangerous!"

364
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,086
Exclamation point.

365
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,606
Okay, so you got Rosa fired.

366
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,396
No, I didn't get her
fired. I reported an issue.

367
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,266
In my line of work, safety is Paramount.

368
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,956
I'm a vp of a commercial real estate firm.

369
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,716
It's very demanding.

370
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,856
Usually, child care falls
to my husband, Mark.

371
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,416
But I had the day off,

372
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,276
so I was able to take
our daughter to the library.

373
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,516
Now, I don't know all the... the kids

374
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,106
and the nannies like my husband does,

375
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,836
'cause I'm not around during the day.

376
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,356
So I had to post on Facebook

377
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,936
to let the parents know
what had happened.

378
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,706
My point is, is that I
tried to do the right thing

379
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:13,906
and it bit me in the ass.

380
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,186
How so?

381
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,496
Well, after I wrote that post,

382
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,056
I was eviscerated in private messages

383
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,916
saying I ruined a woman's career.

384
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,646
Said I needed to check
my privilege. It was...

385
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,986
It was ridiculous.

386
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,676
They wouldn't be saying
that if it was their kid.

387
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,236
Exactly. Okay?

388
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,640
So I just said screw this
and deactivated my account.

389
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,376
- Where were you two nights ago?
- I was working very late.

390
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,486
I have a big, big presentation coming up.

391
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,656
Look, I'm sorry that
this nanny, Tara, is dead,

392
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,240
but I didn't know her.

393
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,316
Well, the initial search
of Tara's apartment didn't

394
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,526
turn up anything of note,
but I wanna go back again

395
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,046
now that we know
more about our suspects.

396
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,140
Hopefully, we'll find some answers.

397
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,946
Talk to me, daph.

398
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,716
Tara has someone saved in
her phone as "little sketchy."

399
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,576
<i>- The texts are intense.
- Little sketchy?</i>

400
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,366
<i>I'm sending them to you now.</i>

401
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,236
I think we may have an
actual stalker on our hands.

402
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,616
Any luck tracking down the other people

403
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,166
who wrote negative posts about Tara?

404
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,826
Still working on it.

405
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,020
Thanks, daph. Bye.

406
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,516
Ooh-Kay! Here we go!

407
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,006
My forever love, why do you forsake me?

408
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,556
"My heart knows not its beat
if it can't echo that of yours."

409
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,976
If I don't see you soon,

410
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,620
"I don't know what I'll do."

411
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,830
That was three days ago.

412
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,730
She never wrote back.

413
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,376
Tara's apartment.

414
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,996
Seems pretty neat.

415
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,780
Still feel kinda weird about
you parking in her spot.

416
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,346
All right. Let's do this methodically.

417
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,300
I'll start with Tara's
desk, and you start...

418
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,100
By making a huge mess.

419
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,310
Look at this.

420
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,870
Tara was religious. Drawer
dump already paying off.

421
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,210
And we got overdue bills.

422
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,560
Notice of a rent increase. Tara
may have had money trouble.

423
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,190
This is interesting.

424
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,096
She knew car in a was
harassing her online.

425
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,656
Well, she may have feared for her life.

426
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,440
She kept pepper spray in her nightstand.

427
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,270
Well, we got a lawyer's number here.

428
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,526
<i>Cleo, Phillips, and Strauss.</i>

429
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,116
Hi, I was wondering if you could tell me

430
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,776
if Tara foley is a client.

431
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,320
<i>I'm afraid we can't
divulge client information.</i>

432
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,086
Right.

433
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,056
Well, who might I speak
to regarding a stalker?

434
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,180
<i>I'm sorry, sir, we're
an immigration law firm.</i>

435
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,570
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

436
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,330
Well, that's strange.

437
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,160
Morgan, look at this.

438
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,106
The night she was murdered, she
was planning on going to church.

439
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,906
Yeah, I'll have hoffy find
out if anyone saw her there.

440
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,936
Still nothing that
points to Brett or car in a

441
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,280
or gives us an idea of
who little sketchy was.

442
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,620
Ew.

443
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,296
Morgan. Don't.

444
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,016
By all means.

445
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,390
Let me parse through the
trash piece by piece like a lady.

446
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,576
I mean, at a certain
point, just treat yourself

447
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,910
to the full-size bar.

448
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,640
Bingo!

449
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,486
"Sunday night poetry slam."

450
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,486
Based on little sketchy's
overly wrought rhyme scheme,

451
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,006
I bet we could find the guy here.

452
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,690
And today just happens
to be... Sunday fun day.

453
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,420
Where is Ava? She's ten minutes late.

454
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,916
Ooh! I forgot to tell you.

455
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,220
Our prime delivery came with
Finn's birthday present in it.

456
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,980
Just ordered it yesterday.
It's already here.

457
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,880
Actually, I don't need it after all.

458
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,646
Turns out I'm the only kid
in class Finn didn't invite.

459
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,190
What? That's gotta be a mistake.

460
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,850
It's not.

461
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,710
I promise.

462
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:06,966
Well, this sucks.

463
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,316
Hey, I still think it's just a mistake.

464
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,076
But if it's not, you're
keeping that present

465
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,060
'cause you're a wonderful
kid and you deserve it.

466
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,086
There you are. Where have
you been? I gotta go to work.

467
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,366
Can you put that down, please?

468
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,916
You have actual people in the room.

469
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,536
I'm just being polite and thanking Ryder

470
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,886
for dropping me off.

471
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,336
Ryder drives?

472
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,956
Most 26-year-olds do.

473
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,506
Not funny.

474
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,120
Not the night and not funny.

475
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,236
As if I couldn't be in a worse mood,

476
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,300
I gotta go to a poetry reading.

477
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,966
Tara, Tara!

478
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,930
You're gone with the wind.

479
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,930
I'm left heartbroken,
beaten and chagrined.

480
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,210
Goodbye, Tara-saurus.

481
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,730
Who's sore? Us.

482
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,800
Who's dead?

483
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,986
You.

484
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,290
Thank you.

485
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,406
Excuse me.

486
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,476
We need to talk.

487
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,926
I'm detective karadec,

488
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,966
this is consultant gillory, with the LAPD.

489
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,136
We're looking into the
murder of Tara foley.

490
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,540
Good.

491
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,340
I know who killed her.

492
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,196
Bryan schlotzky is on
his way in for questioning.

493
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,676
You know, I can't stress enough

494
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,266
the importance of
hand-to-hand combat training

495
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,336
in our line of work.

496
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,166
I could show you a few moves.

497
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,266
Can't believe you brought Chuck
the canuck back to our precinct.

498
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,260
Well, you gotta admit,
it's fun to watch oz squirm.

499
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,176
Daphne, any luck
finding the other people

500
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,136
who posted about Tara on
that 90049 parents' group?

501
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,206
Still looking. It's a needle in a haystack.

502
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,000
There's so many moms
named Megan out there.

503
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,666
I think we might have
someone else to consider.

504
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,590
Mark, carina's husband.

505
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,426
Mark's in a lot of these
photos. He and Tara seem cozy.

506
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:05,086
And in this one, he's wielding a bat.

507
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,110
That could cause a hematoma.
Can you go back one?

508
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,996
Tara's wearing Mark's sweatshirt.

509
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,126
Well, how do you know?

510
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,336
It's got the old supersonics logo on it.

511
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,346
Supersonics. Fast food joint.

512
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,686
No. Former NBA team based in Seattle.

513
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,416
In 2008, they moved to Oklahoma

514
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,626
and played under a different
sound-themed name, the thunder.

515
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,246
I think Mark was from Seattle.

516
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,456
<i>On their mantle, I saw a family photo</i>

517
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,006
<i>of them standing at the space needle.</i>

518
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,836
<i>In the distance, you
could see mount rainier,</i>

519
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,086
<i>and in the foreground were
the arches of lumen field.</i>

520
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,396
Daphne, pay Mark a visit.

521
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,736
Find out what the real nature

522
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,226
of his relationship was with Tara.

523
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,366
Got it. Oz, can you print these for me?

524
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,670
Yeah.

525
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,436
And it would appear that little sketchy

526
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,360
has arrived for his interview.

527
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,850
Ooh.

528
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,330
Give me one sec, real quick.

529
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,416
- Hello?
- Hi, this is Jean Anne,

530
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,656
<i>Finn's mom, returning your call.</i>

531
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,276
Hi, Jean Anne. Hey.

532
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,766
Listen, I think there's
been a misunderstanding.

533
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,696
See, my son Elliot believes
he's the only kid not invited

534
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,496
to your son's birthday party.

535
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,736
<i>Finn made the guest list.</i>

536
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,116
<i>It's a small group, and he and
Elliot don't know each other that well.</i>

537
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,496
That's an easy fix.

538
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,016
Why doesn't he come over
tomorrow for a playdate?

539
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,816
<i>Tomorrow? I guess that could work.</i>

540
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,630
Perfect. We'll see Finn then. Great, bye.

541
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,570
Motherhood has made
me so understanding.

542
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,646
How did you know Tara?

543
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,950
Tara was my babysitter.

544
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,896
Where were you the night Tara died?

545
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,726
I was outside her apartment complex

546
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,556
blasting a love song through a speaker.

547
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,270
Can anyone confirm that?

548
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,726
Several of the tenants
were quite frustrated

549
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,510
with my act of devotion.

550
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,836
At the poetry reading,

551
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,930
you said you knew who killed Tara.

552
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,690
It was Mark.

553
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,606
A dad at the playground.

554
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,086
He started horning in

555
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,886
and made Tara cut me out of her life.

556
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,980
But Tara would never
be with a married man.

557
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,220
So he killed her.

558
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,136
Hi. Mark?

559
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,270
Daphne forrester, LAPD.

560
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,060
Is there news about Tara?

561
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,960
Not exactly.

562
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,146
Can you tell me why Tara
was wearing your sweatshirt

563
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,286
in this photo?

564
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,450
I guess she was cold?

565
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,396
Looks like you two were pretty close.

566
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,916
We were.

567
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,916
Ward and my daughter,
Ruby, were playground friends,

568
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,630
so I got to know her pretty well.

569
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,986
You know, she didn't have any family,

570
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,330
so I was there for her,
gave her advice when I could.

571
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,810
Was it more than friendship for you?

572
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,300
What? No!

573
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:41,076
No. I love my wife. I'm devoted to her.

574
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,696
Tara was a friend.

575
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,316
Okay. Where were
you the night Tara died?

576
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,736
Here, hosting book club.

577
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,326
We were reading Liz Gilbert's big magic.

578
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,526
Wait, actually, you know what?

579
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,536
You can ask anyone in my book club.

580
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,056
We're called the "Lou reads."
Except "read" is spelled

581
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,180
I can guess.

582
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,910
Is that your bat?

583
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,850
This?

584
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,246
Yeah, it's for wiffle ball.
It's plastic. Totally harmless.

585
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,580
See?

586
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,760
You're doing great!

587
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,290
I have actual race cars if you
wanna do a tactile thing later.

588
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,570
I've got freshly opened cookies.

589
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,090
Do you have anything
without refined sugar?

590
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,820
Let me go look.

591
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,896
Gosh. Imagine being
there in the summer of '56

592
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,270
when art ingels invented the first go-kart.

593
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,696
Dude! You made me lose!

594
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,386
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

595
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,216
You really suck the fun out of everything.

596
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,186
You know, I'm only here
because my mom made me, right?

597
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,256
You're just a weirdo who can't shut up.

598
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,326
That's why you're not
invited to my birthday party.

599
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,846
Hey, Finn.

600
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,716
I'm taking everybody to
knott's Berry farm next week,

601
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,026
and you're not invited.

602
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,576
I sure would love to bring you along,

603
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,476
but they got a "no turd kid" policy,

604
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,646
so I guess we'll just have
to miss you on this one.

605
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,586
Why don't you grab your
stuff and go sit on the porch

606
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,810
and wait for your mom.

607
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,060
Bye! Thanks for coming.

608
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,186
I kind of blacked out. How bad was it?

609
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,046
What just came out of my mouth?

610
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,140
Bad.

611
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,730
It was all bad.

612
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,886
I'm so sorry I forced a playdate.

613
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,360
Finn does not deserve a friend like you.

614
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,670
I know it's hard to be different.

615
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,096
But listen.

616
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,680
You are fun, no matter
what that little jerk says.

617
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,300
I'll believe it when I see it.

618
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,876
I don't know. One of
them thinks he's not cool,

619
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,636
and the other one's
basically divorced herself

620
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,326
from our family.

621
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,636
If she's not with her boyfriend,
she's constantly texting him.

622
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,056
Yep.

623
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,576
I'm so sorry, Morgan,
but this too shall pass.

624
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,166
And then something
even harder will come up.

625
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,460
Good. Thank you so much.

626
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,360
Honestly, this foley
case is driving me nuts.

627
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,516
We are missing something. I can feel it.

628
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,950
I do too.

629
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,526
Brett's couples counseling
alibi checked out.

630
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,386
Although, he may have
hired someone to kill Tara.

631
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,100
Look into his financials.

632
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,240
You might wanna see this.

633
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,636
Tara's with the other nannies
in a lot of Chuck's photos.

634
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,916
They might've known each
other better than we thought.

635
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,980
I mean, they did spend
every day together.

636
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,616
Our main suspects all have alibis,

637
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,136
not all airtight, but still.

638
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,896
Go back to the nannies.

639
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,866
Find out everything
they know about Tara,

640
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,066
anything we may have missed.

641
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,076
- Yeah.
- Oz.

642
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,036
I remembered that boxing
combo is lethal if done correctly.

643
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,386
- I'm actually heading out.
- We'll talk about it later.

644
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,076
- Morgan, you and I should tag along.
- Yeah.

645
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,696
Karadec, you wanna
play some handball?

646
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,000
- Soon as I get back, bro.
- All right. Whoo.

647
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,366
Remember the good old days, Selena,

648
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,226
you know, when you could
arrest a perp in the morning

649
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,226
and then take him out for a
beer in the afternoon, you know?

650
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,606
When everybody wasn't so
sensitive about everything.

651
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,980
Darius!

652
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,710
Come here, please.

653
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,880
I wanted to ask you
about the Tara foley case.

654
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,160
Chuck, I think you better excuse us.

655
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,586
You want me to get
the Chuck out of here.

656
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,720
My hourly rates are too high.

657
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,750
Thank you, Chuck.

658
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:50,906
You are a lifesaver.

659
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,806
I hope I didn't pull you
from anything urgent.

660
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:56,426
Nope. Just snagging a cup of the
good coffee you guys have up here.

661
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,056
But I do have an update.

662
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,086
The toxicologist report on
Tara foley came out clean,

663
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,886
and we found no evidence of
defensive wounds on her body.

664
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,166
Which means when she was
attacked, she didn't fight back.

665
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,786
She was taken by surprise.
Or she knew her attacker.

666
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:08,880
Seems like it.

667
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,100
We're hoping you can tell
us a little more about Tara.

668
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:21,310
She was nice. Almost too nice.

669
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,410
She didn't know her worth.

670
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,186
I hear she was working

671
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,426
for ten dollars an hour less than we do.

672
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,140
And with no benefits.

673
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,396
Poor thing.

674
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,816
An extra ten bucks an hour
would help with those overdue bills.

675
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,366
This job is easier if you work together.

676
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,546
Coordinate. Only one nanny
needs to bring a soccer ball.

677
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,600
That sort of thing.

678
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,136
But she didn't take us
up on our offers to help.

679
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,780
You know, the saddest part is,

680
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,710
she might still be
alive if she was a joiner.

681
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,616
Joiner? What do you mean?

682
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,966
Well, the night that she
passed, I was house-sitting,

683
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,620
so I had these girls over to just hang out.

684
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,930
She could've been with us.

685
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,930
But instead... God rest her soul.

686
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,736
The only one she was
friends with was Mark.

687
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,876
Bet his wife didn't like
that. What was her name?

688
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,156
- Carina.
- Right. Carina.

689
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,980
You remember that fight?

690
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,646
What fight?

691
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:18,190
His wife show up one day
and scream at Tara and Mark.

692
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,260
Tara look really frightened.

693
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,626
Carina's motive just
got a whole lot clearer.

694
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,386
- <i>She was jealous.
- Didn't she have an alibi?</i>

695
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,216
She said she was working late,

696
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,186
which was confirmed by
the security log at her office.

697
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,836
Anyone can jump a turnstile if
they wanna avoid scanning their ID.

698
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,730
Or they don't have money for the Metro.

699
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,296
Wanna sneak into a
Brandi carlile concert.

700
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,900
Just for example.

701
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,056
- Karadec.
- Hey, it's Daphne.

702
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,676
You know those other moms
who posted negative things

703
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,376
about Tara in the
Brentwood parents' group?

704
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,856
- Yeah.
- They don't exist.

705
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,166
Don't exist?

706
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,786
Their profiles appear to be fake.

707
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,166
So somebody who hated Tara

708
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,540
created fake profiles to drag her?

709
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,106
Yeah, we're about to go talk
to somebody who fits that bill.

710
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,480
Thanks, Daphne.

711
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,876
So, we need to be keeping
an eye on sustainability,

712
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,110
as our clients value...

713
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,856
Tell us about the heated argument

714
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,616
you and Mark had at the park, please.

715
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,926
Did it have anything to do with
Mark's relationship with Tara?

716
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,726
What? No. Are you...

717
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,206
Are you suggesting I
was jealous of Tara?

718
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,726
Well, jealousy is a common motive.

719
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,346
You wouldn't exactly
be rewriting the playbook.

720
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:42,100
I wasn't mad about Tara.
I was mad about our deck.

721
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,526
Mark had one simple job.

722
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,776
Just order the wood for our new deck.

723
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,356
And out of all the types of wood,

724
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,180
do you know which one he ordered?

725
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,870
Alaskan spruce.

726
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:58,096
Everyone knows that Alaskan
spruce shrinks end-grain.

727
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,360
Okay? And causes serious
problems when it gets wet.

728
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,346
Right. I know that, but I'm not everyone.

729
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,826
You are the only real person

730
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,276
we can link to the
negative posts about Tara.

731
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,726
All the other profiles were fake.

732
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,696
Did you maybe create them
to upset the young woman

733
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,556
that your husband was so close with?

734
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,520
My god. Look, I told you,
I never posted about Tara.

735
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,380
Only Rosa.

736
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:23,566
I took my daughter to story
time at the library one time, okay?

737
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:28,086
As a working mother,
that is a special opportunity

738
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,606
to hang out with your kid
in the middle of the day.

739
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,716
And while I was there,

740
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,056
I happened to see something awful,

741
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,546
so I said something.

742
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,476
And then it backfired
and I deleted my account.

743
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,710
Hang on. Hang on.
What time is story time?

744
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,516
Noon.

745
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,206
All the comments
about Tara were posted

746
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,966
between 12:00 and 1:00 P.M. story time.

747
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,626
<i>It's basically a time</i>

748
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,216
<i>when caretakers get
to take a little breather</i>

749
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,906
<i>because the kids are
otherwise occupied.</i>

750
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:52,426
<i>And who would want to
infiltrate a parent group</i>

751
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,970
where the subject is trashing nannies?

752
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:56,970
The nannies!

753
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,056
They were in that group
under fake accounts.

754
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,706
They bullied car in a off of Facebook

755
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,336
when she came for Rosa,
and then, once Tara was hired,

756
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,196
they scraped her old
profile and made a new one.

757
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,066
They posed as car in a
and other concerned parents,

758
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,376
and they reported Tara.

759
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,166
But the other nannies liked Tara.

760
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,996
Did they? I've been on the outside
of the mom clique enough times

761
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,556
to know when people
are being nice to your face

762
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,386
but judging you behind your back.

763
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,696
When people like Tara come
in and work for less money

764
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,456
and no benefits, they devalue our job.

765
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,076
She didn't abide by the nanny code.

766
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,140
Tara wasn't welcome.
She replaced our friend.

767
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,256
Those nannies resented Tara.

768
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,986
She threatened their very way of life.

769
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,350
Not to mention, they were
loyal to the woman she replaced.

770
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,390
- Rosa.
- Or should we say sporty spice?

771
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,780
Each of the kids had a spice
girl sticker on their lunch box.

772
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,346
<i>Which was clearly for the nannies,</i>

773
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,766
'cause what three-year-old
gives a "zig-a-zig"

774
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,626
- <i>about a 30-year-old band?
- Band?</i>

775
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,100
Except there was one spice girl missing.

776
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,086
<i>Sporty spice was tucked
away in the back of the shelf</i>

777
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,566
<i>in Brett and Jeff's house.</i>

778
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,186
Tara didn't want to use that lunch box

779
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,806
because the spice girls stickers

780
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,156
<i>were the original five nannies' thing.</i>

781
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,676
And Tara was on the outs.

782
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,266
So you think all the nannies killed Tara

783
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,056
because they were
mad she replaced Rosa?

784
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,700
Nope. Oksana did.

785
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,616
And you know this because...

786
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,236
Because of the capitalization
conventions in the Russian language.

787
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,996
<i>In the post that car in a
admits to writing about Rosa,</i>

788
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,540
she capitalizes the day of the
week that the incident occurred.

789
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:30,906
<i>But in the post that car in
a denies writing about Tara,</i>

790
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:32,316
<i>the days of the week are lowercased,</i>

791
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,626
which would only make sense

792
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,526
if you were a native Russian speaker.

793
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,356
Because in Russian, you
don't capitalize days of the week.

794
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,326
But even if oksana
was bullying Tara online,

795
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,706
using fake accounts,

796
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,296
that doesn't mean she killed her.

797
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,606
Well, of course it does.

798
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,150
'Cause of the way she crossed herself.

799
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,196
You guys aren't up-to-date
on the great schism

800
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,026
between eastern
orthodoxy and catholicism?

801
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:53,850
- Okay.
- Not totally.

802
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,276
Okay, in 1054, there was a huge fight

803
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,306
<i>between western and eastern churches</i>

804
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,866
<i>called the great schism.</i>

805
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,456
And this resulted in a few
fundamental differences

806
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,556
between how each church does things,

807
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,496
one of those differences being
how members cross themselves.

808
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,410
Okay, now this is ringing a bell.

809
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,426
<i>Catholics use five fingers,</i>

810
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,116
<i>and they cross forehead, chest,</i>

811
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,776
<i>left shoulder, right shoulder.</i>

812
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,946
Orthodox christians cross
themselves using three fingers,

813
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:22,956
<i>forehead, chest, right
shoulder to left shoulder.</i>

814
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,856
<i>Now, when we were
chatting with the nannies,</i>

815
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,816
<i>I saw oksana cross herself in
the eastern orthodox manner.</i>

816
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,276
How does oksana's religion
mean she killed Tara?

817
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,856
Another result of the great schism

818
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,276
is that the two sides
use different calendars.

819
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,516
<i>Catholics use a gregorian calendar</i>

820
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,796
<i>introduced by a pope in 1582.</i>

821
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,556
<i>Orthodox christians still
use a Julian calendar.</i>

822
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,766
Basically, it means they
celebrate the same holidays,

823
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,496
but certain holidays
fall on different dates,

824
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,596
much to the chagrin
of the little Greek girl

825
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,086
whose easter bunny comes
a month after her friends got

826
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,326
to eat all their cadbury eggs.

827
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,706
- I love those.
- Girl, same.

828
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,730
So good.

829
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,490
You can go back to work now.

830
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,956
Now, do we know what
religion Tara foley was?

831
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,306
- Catholic?
- Catholic!

832
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,306
<i>We found a rosary.</i>

833
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,726
That's classic catholic.

834
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,306
But don't forget what I
said about the calendars.

835
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,826
How could we?

836
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,146
On Tara's calendar, she
had marked down a date

837
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,976
<i>for the exaltation of the
cross, September 27th.</i>

838
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,696
But catholics celebrate that on the 14th.

839
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,186
So she wasn't planning
to go to her church service.

840
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,666
She was going to oksana's.

841
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,736
Tara had figured out
that oksana was the one

842
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,056
who was bullying her, and that explains

843
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,086
<i>the number for the immigration
lawyer we found in her apartment.</i>

844
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,746
Identity fraud is a crime that
can get your visa revoked.

845
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,126
Tara knew that by making
fake profiles on Facebook

846
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,506
and pretending to be car in a,

847
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,096
oksana was putting her visa in jeopardy

848
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,166
and she could be deported.

849
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,276
Exactly.

850
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,546
Tara knew that oksana was gonna be
at the Russian orthodox church that night.

851
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,200
Which is a block away from the park.

852
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,556
<i>After the service, Tara
confronted oksana.</i>

853
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,860
<i>Oksana freaked out and
bashed her in the head.</i>

854
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,210
<i>She thought she'd finished
the job, but she didn't.</i>

855
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,566
<i>Tara was out of sorts, afraid
that oksana would follow her.</i>

856
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:03,420
<i>She went to the park, hid
in the slide, where she died.</i>

857
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,506
Were you with oksana the
night Tara was murdered?

858
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,026
- Yes.
- Yes.

859
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,716
- Yes.
- Can you tell me what you did that night?

860
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,376
My employers were out of town,

861
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,066
so I just had a girls' night in.

862
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:16,616
We had some drinks, went in
the hot tub. Oksana made dinner.

863
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,446
- Then watched a movie.
- Everyone left around 1:00 A.M.

864
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,416
Well, thanks. Super helpful.

865
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,510
We're just gonna go ahead
and check the nanny cams.

866
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,046
They don't have nanny cams.

867
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,766
Well, the whole point of a nanny cam is

868
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,550
that you don't tell the nanny.

869
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,466
- Oksana wasn't there.
- Oksana's a very scary lady.

870
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,390
She made us lie. Oksana
swore it was an accident.

871
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,456
I can't believe you found
nanny cams and didn't tell me.

872
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,280
I was bluffing.

873
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,380
Sneaky spice.

874
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,840
Your friends turned on you.

875
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:20,220
They said you forced
them to provide your alibi.

876
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,500
We know that you are
the one who killed Tara.

877
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,580
That little bitch threaten me.

878
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,416
Said she's gonna have
me sent back to Russia

879
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,070
for creating those posts.

880
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,636
After everything I sacrifice to get here.

881
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,310
After the persecution my family endured.

882
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:45,320
Tara had no idea what going
back would mean for me.

883
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,600
That's why I pick up that rock!

884
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,126
You could have just
promised to stop bullying her.

885
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,740
I couldn't take risk.

886
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,570
I would always be
looking over my shoulder.

887
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,710
I choose prison here over
going back to Russia any day.

888
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,440
And so you have.

889
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,570
I gotta go do something.
You guys play. Have fun.

890
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,196
Hey. There was a
time you would've killed

891
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,856
to go to the playground.

892
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,161
Well, it's because Ava would
make me puke on the spinner.

893
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,920
It was fun.

894
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,990
But we're different people now.

895
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,216
You wanna play over there?

896
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,046
Okay, go. You can go over there.

897
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,380
Don't go too far!

898
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,380
- Hey, Jeff.
- Hey.

899
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,326
Thought I might find you here.

900
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:55,150
Well, it hasn't felt right
to hire a new nanny yet.

901
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,110
I'm so relieved that
Tara's killer is behind bars.

902
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,576
Tara deserved that, at least.

903
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,126
Well, now that the case is closed,

904
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,160
there's something I
thought you might like.

905
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,990
Wow.

906
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,000
I never got to see this, you know?

907
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,410
Their everyday together.

908
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,286
That is... that is the heartbreaking thing

909
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,706
about being a working parent

910
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,606
that... your kid has all these experiences

911
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,110
that you are just not a part of.

912
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,406
Your main focus when
you hire a caretaker is

913
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,740
that your child will be safe.

914
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:42,120
But your hope is that
your child will be loved.

915
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,990
And ward was loved by Tara.

916
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,990
And I knew that.

917
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,580
But now I get to see it.

918
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,670
Race you to the spinner.

919
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,180
- Wait! Come on!
- Come on!

920
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:11,840
- Get on!
- Wait up. Okay, I'm on. I'm on.

921
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,260
Whoo!

922
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,470
- Come on.
- Okay.

923
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,610
You're going so much faster than before!

924
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,060
Yeah!

925
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,060
Ava, you're going to make
me lose my lunch! Don't stop!

926
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,650
Whoa!

927
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,366
Yeah? I'm gonna make you
puke up yesterday's lunch too!

928
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,700
Wahoo!

929
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,180
Whoa! Whoo!
