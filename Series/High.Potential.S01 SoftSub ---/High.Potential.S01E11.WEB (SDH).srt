1
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:16,049
Bunny... [breathing heavily]
...I want this on camera.

2
00:00:16,818 --> 00:00:18,853
I have something important
to say.

3
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:23,825
All right, Dad. I'm recording.

4
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,961
There's a secret
I've been keeping for ten years,

5
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:30,130
and I need
to get it off my chest.

6
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,498
Dad.

7
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:33,001
Let me say this, Son.

8
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:36,169
It's time the truth came out.

9
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:38,338
Thanksgiving.

10
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,307
Ten years ago.

11
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:42,844
It was me.

12
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,444
[panting]

13
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:45,880
I killed Barry.

14
00:00:45,914 --> 00:00:47,782
Grandpa. No.

15
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:49,817
When you all were in bed,

16
00:00:49,851 --> 00:00:53,521
I waited for Barry at the top
of the basement stairs,

17
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:56,423
and I pushed him to his death.

18
00:00:56,991 --> 00:01:00,662
And then, I moved his body
into the sauna,

19
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:04,532
hoping that it would all
be written off as an accident.

20
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:05,833
That's not true, darling.

21
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:09,037
It is true.
And it's time I admit it.

22
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,989
[Morgan] Morgan Gillory, LAPD.

23
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:29,156
[Karadec sighs]

24
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,358
Freeze.
Morgan Gillory, Major Crimes.

25
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,628
It worked. You're frozen.

26
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,864
Give me that.
Where did you get this?

27
00:01:36,898 --> 00:01:38,365
Checkout at the Dollar Store.

28
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,602
Turns out anyone can be a cop
if you wait in line long enough.

29
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:41,869
Chloe couldn't resist.

30
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:43,337
There should be a law
against these things.

31
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,439
That's what I was about to say.
It's an absolute outrage.

32
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:49,911
Why is Jon down here with Melon?
He never comes to this floor.

33
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,244
I have no idea.

34
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,747
[Lieutenant Melon] Top of
the morning to ya, Selena.

35
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,516
[Selena] Melon, Detective Jon.
What can I do for you gentlemen?

36
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,918
[Detective Jon]
Celebrate with us.

37
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,686
We closed a cold case
this morning.

38
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,120
-[Selena] Which one?
-[Lieutenant Melon]
We got a confession

39
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,254
on the Bucket Lane Murder.

40
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:03,992
[Selena] Who confessed?

41
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:05,627
[Lieutenant Melon] The guy
Captain and I thought did it.

42
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,362
The old man came clean
on his deathbed.

43
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,163
He brought champagne.

44
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,833
Maybe Lieutenant's
getting promoted.

45
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:14,267
Mm-mmm. Melon wouldn't
ride along for that.

46
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,570
[Detective Jon]
This is a big win.

47
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:17,404
Some detectives never catch
their white whale.

48
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,508
[Lieutenant Melon] He's right.
Enjoy your champagne.

49
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,282
[chair clatters]

50
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:32,386
[sighs]

51
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,855
Who has the good scotch?

52
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,223
Morgan Gillory, Liquor Patrol.

53
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,660
-How did you get that back?
-They come in a two-pack.

54
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,061
Lieutenant, what was that about?

55
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:41,562
The Bucket Lane Murder.

56
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:43,865
George Donovan confessed
on his deathbed.

57
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:45,667
A decade later?

58
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,835
Bucket Lane Murder.

59
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:49,971
Sounds familiar,
but the details are fuzzy.

60
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,140
Morgan Gillory is fuzzy
on the details?

61
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,109
It was in the news for months.
Were you living under a rock
in 2014?

62
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:57,812
-[Young Ava drumming
continuously]
-Sorry. Sorry.

63
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,847
Ooh, whoops.

64
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:01,549
I would've killed
for a rock to live under.

65
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:05,620
It was murder in a mansion?
Or something about a sauna?

66
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,155
Melon and I were
junior detectives.

67
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,723
He liked George for it.

68
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:11,491
I had reservations.
George beat the case.

69
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:12,794
But he confesses now?

70
00:03:12,827 --> 00:03:14,394
Now I need to know
the whole story.

71
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,165
Follow me.

72
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,834
Day after Thanksgiving 2014,

73
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,036
Heather Donovan's husband,
Barry Johnson,

74
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,539
was murdered in the family home.

75
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,941
The housekeeper found him
in the sauna,

76
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:29,010
slow-cooked like Texas barbecue.

77
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:33,181
The family assumed
that Barry fell asleep

78
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,749
during his nightly shvitz.

79
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:37,952
But the autopsy revealed
cause of death
to be a broken neck.

80
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:39,954
He was dead
before he went into the sauna.

81
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:42,322
Yeah, the theory was the killer
pushed Barry down the stairs,

82
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,691
breaking his neck,

83
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:45,225
then placed him in the sauna
to cover up the crime.

84
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,695
Hoping it'd be written off as
an intoxicated man passing out

85
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:48,796
and dehydrating in there.

86
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,164
Lenore, George's wife, said

87
00:03:50,198 --> 00:03:52,767
she saw Barry heading
to the basement in his robe

88
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,001
shortly after midnight.

89
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:55,536
That's the last time
anyone saw him alive.

90
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,606
Everyone's in bed and claimed
not to have heard anything,

91
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,509
but a drop of Barry's blood was
found on one of George's shirts

92
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,111
stuffed in the laundry hamper.

93
00:04:03,144 --> 00:04:06,080
This is why he ended up
in the defendant's chair.

94
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:08,783
I thought it was a weak case,
but the DA ran with it.

95
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:10,718
Ultimately,
there wasn't enough to convict

96
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:12,285
because of the coke dealer.

97
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:14,088
There's a coke dealer too?

98
00:04:14,122 --> 00:04:15,690
Billy Ross.

99
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:19,026
He's dead now. He was pulled
over for running a stop sign

100
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,495
shortly after midnight in
his gold 442,

101
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,997
five blocks from the murder.

102
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,632
And Barry had cocaine
in his system.

103
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,535
The defense presented
this far-fetched theory

104
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,070
that Billy Ross
broke into the house,

105
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,038
killed Barry
after a drug deal gone wrong

106
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:32,673
when we never found any proof

107
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:35,009
that Billy Ross was ever
even at the house.

108
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:38,179
George got off, but Melon always
believed he was the killer.

109
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:39,312
Why didn't you?

110
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,217
Gut instinct.
It just didn't add up.

111
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:44,585
George was well-liked.

112
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:46,988
He never had
any history of violence.

113
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:48,556
He was a philanthropist.

114
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,858
He was a bigwig
at the chamber of commerce.

115
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:54,095
He spearheaded that whole
affordable housing initiative.

116
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,495
So he didn't seem
like a murderer.

117
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,731
That was part of it.

118
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,666
I also didn't buy
that a 70-something-year-old man

119
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,035
with a hip replacement could
carry Barry into the sauna.

120
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,703
Well, Barry was
a little guy though.

121
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:03,604
Still.

122
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,640
So what's your gut say now?

123
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:12,445
The aftermath of the crime
has been brutal on the Donovans.

124
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,447
They used to be
the most well-respected family

125
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,551
in Beverly Hills
for their ties to politics

126
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:19,386
and a charity for domestic
violence victims in their name.

127
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,289
And suddenly overnight,

128
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,158
half of America believes one
of them has to be a murderer.

129
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:27,094
Now George confesses
to the crime?

130
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:29,063
I think he did it
to clear his family.

131
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:31,265
He wanted them to be able
to lead normal lives.

132
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:32,733
Who do you think did it?

133
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,871
I don't know.

134
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,708
Thank you for joining me
on this trip down memory lane.

135
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:44,245
Yeah.

136
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,448
Sure you don't want me
to track down that scotch?

137
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,552
No. But there's something
you can do for me.

138
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,423
Every cop has that one case they
can't get out of their head,

139
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,625
and this one's mine.

140
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,128
I regret not following my gut
ten years ago.

141
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:02,530
Why didn't you?

142
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,799
I let Melon talk me out
of going deeper on my hunch.

143
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:07,501
I felt like
I had to toe the line,

144
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:09,837
be one of the boys
for the sake of my career.

145
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:14,041
I am embarrassed
I let that happen.

146
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:23,017
Mind seeing
if there's something we missed?

147
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:27,588
On it, boss.

-[music stops]
-Yes.

180
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,524
Lieutenant,

181
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:12,660
you were right.

182
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:18,632
George Donovan did not push
his son-in-law down the stairs.

183
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,502
In fact, no one did.

184
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:33,114
First of all, Barry was not
killed on the basement stairs.

185
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:36,317
Barry was killed
in the common bathroom upstairs.

186
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,651
So what then?

187
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,120
The killer carried
Barry's dead body

188
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:40,221
all the way down to the sauna?

189
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,555
Not exactly.

190
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:44,091
Let me take you back
to the Donovan mansion

191
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,192
the night of the murder.

192
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,963
We find the killer walking down
the upstairs hallway.

193
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,531
He or she passes the bathroom

194
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,833
and hears Barry showering
inside.

195
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:53,968
Showering wasn't in the file.

196
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,570
Are... Are you gonna
interrupt the whole time?

197
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:58,105
-I just got going.
-My bad.

198
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:01,575
The killer finds Barry
vulnerable in the shower.

199
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,744
He or she looks around...

200
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:08,349
and spots a hair dryer
and thinks,

201
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,752
"You know what can pass as
a heart attack in an autopsy?"

202
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:13,954
An electrocution.

203
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:18,492
So that's that for Barry.

204
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:21,295
But... now
the electrical outlet's on fire.

205
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,064
[outlet crackles, sizzles]

206
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:25,900
So the killer freaks
out 'cause, you know, flames.

207
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:32,239
[sighs] But mostly because now
there's evidence of a murder.

208
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:34,875
So, the wallpaper-covered
faceplate is scorched.

209
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:37,878
And that's not good, but it's
a problem for later because...

210
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,247
First, it's time
to move the body.

211
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:42,551
Now remember, the guy
only weighed about 150 pounds.

212
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,684
So...

213
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,220
down the laundry chute he goes.

214
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,756
-The laundry chute?
-[Morgan] Mm-hmm.

215
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:50,724
That's how he got down
to the basement?

216
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:52,226
It sure is.

217
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,729
It's also how he broke his neck.

218
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:58,766
And it's how Barry's blood
ended up on George's shirt.

219
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,901
And then what?

220
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:04,305
Then the killer rolls
Barry's body to the sauna.

221
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,176
He carefully props him up,

222
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,812
places an empty wine bottle
next to him...

223
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:15,783
and cooks him to perfection.

224
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:19,887
And that is
how Barry Johnson met his maker.

225
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,758
I get it.
You're still processing.

226
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,127
It's okay.
It's all very exciting.

227
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,661
Let me show you some evidence.

228
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:31,765
Every single inch of this house
was photographed.

229
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,834
Remember that scorched
wall plate I was talking about?

230
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,570
Right there.

231
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:38,272
Yeah,
but it's not scorched though.

232
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,541
But it's plain.

233
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:41,610
All the other outlets
are covered in wallpaper.

234
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,545
There, there and there.

235
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:46,347
That means the killer
switched out the wallpaper plate

236
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,716
with the plain one
to hide the scorch marks.

237
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,585
I guarantee you,
there's scorching
underneath that wall plate.

238
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:53,387
-There's just one problem.
-[scoffs] Ah, just one?

239
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,223
People don't get electrocuted
by hair dryers anymore.

240
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:58,292
-There are safety features now.
-That's true.

241
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,630
In 1990, the Consumer Product
Safety Commission

242
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,298
issued manufacturing
requirements for hair dryers,

243
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,233
including safeguards
against electrocution.

244
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:07,536
But look at their hair dryer.

245
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:13,073
This is a 1980s model
Air Zan 1200.

246
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:15,776
Okay, but Lenore saw Barry
heading toward the basement

247
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:16,877
at midnight.

248
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:18,913
By stairs, not by laundry chute.

249
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:20,681
Lenore also admitted
to drinking a bunch of wine.

250
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,716
So maybe she didn't see
what she thought she saw.

251
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,619
Or maybe she's covering
for the real killer.

252
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,088
[Oz grunts]

253
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:30,758
Ten years ago, Pacheco insisted
we only dig deep

254
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,960
into the family's alibis
after midnight,

255
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,296
the time we thought
Barry was killed.

256
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:36,997
But if he was murdered
before midnight,

257
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:38,432
before anyone went to bed,

258
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,768
anyone of those family members
could be our killer.

259
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,036
Yeah.

260
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,808
We need to talk to 'em.

261
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:52,146
Daphne, Oz, hold down the fort
while we're gone.

262
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,982
Selena,
if the captain finds out

263
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:57,318
you're reopening a closed case
behind his back,

264
00:11:57,351 --> 00:11:59,386
that's how Jon got exiled
to traffic.

265
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:01,690
Let me worry about that.

266
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,431
I spoke to Lenore Donovan.

267
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:12,199
Explained we had
a few loose ends to tie up

268
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,034
before we can officially
close the case.

269
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:16,370
She said the housekeeper
will let us inside

270
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,506
while the family's out
scattering George's ashes.

271
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,608
Nice.

272
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:21,610
First, we need to pick up
Ida Perp.

273
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,279
-Who's Ida Perp?
-[elevator bell rings]

274
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,253
[secretary] Yes.

275
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,557
Hi. I'd like to speak
to your detectives

276
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,258
about the Bucket Lane Murder.

277
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,528
My name is Nedda Donovan,
and I've got a story to tell.

278
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:43,732
[fountain water trickling]

279
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:02,149
[doorbell chimes]

280
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:07,288
Oh. Hello.

281
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,357
I'm Lieutenant Soto.
This is Detective Karadec.

282
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:12,493
Hi. I'm Morgan,
I'm the consultant.

283
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:13,827
This is Ida Perp.

284
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:15,195
She's faking this,
so he'll carry her. [chuckles]

285
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:16,997
[Selena] I believe
you're expecting us.

286
00:13:17,031 --> 00:13:18,767
[Morgan] Yeah.
Can we see the bathroom, please?

287
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,535
The one upstairs
with the laundry chute?

288
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:21,603
[housekeeper scoffs]

289
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:23,605
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

290
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:28,842
If your theory is correct,
we should find...

291
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:31,513
Scorch marks?

292
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:34,048
Then the killer did
switch the plate

293
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:35,449
to hide an electrical fire.

294
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,084
So where did
that plate come from?

295
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:39,788
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say
the room Barry was staying in.

296
00:13:42,724 --> 00:13:44,091
Look for a scorched face plate

297
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,393
covered in the same wallpaper
as the bathroom.

298
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:01,375
Hmm.

299
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,447
Look at this. Security cameras
all over the house.

300
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,282
Why wouldn't the footage
show up in the case file?

301
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,351
Yeah, the family said
the footage was deleted.

302
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:11,985
Little help?

303
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:18,992
[Karadec grunts] That's good.

304
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:20,961
[Karadec] That's our plate.

305
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,296
Yes.

306
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:26,934
Good work, Morgan.
Come on, Ida. It's showtime.

307
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:30,070
-[Selena through chute] Ready!
-[Morgan grunts]

308
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:31,338
Oh, hello.

309
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:33,675
Make mama proud, okay? [grunts]

310
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,812
[Ida Perp thudding]

311
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:46,320
That'd break a neck.

312
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:48,055
She was right.

313
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,425
Barry was killed in the shower
and thrown down the chute.

314
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,094
[Morgan through chute]
Is Ida okay?

315
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:55,162
[Karadec sighs]

316
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:05,305
Guys, this is a public building.
We're allowed to film here.

317
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,275
You're standing in the way
of journalism.

318
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,712
We are standing in the way of
murder porn.

319
00:15:10,745 --> 00:15:12,079
Let's just call it what it is.

320
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,648
Look, your crew can film
all they want,

321
00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:14,883
but we're not speaking
on camera.

322
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:18,620
[scoffs]
We're a legit production, guys.

323
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,395
-See?
-Ken Burns could walk in here,

324
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:29,997
set all of his Emmys
on the table,

325
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,666
and we're still not talking
on camera.

326
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:33,467
I don't know who Ken Burns is.

327
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,704
But what if I told you

328
00:15:36,738 --> 00:15:40,073
I know for a fact,
George's confession is a sham?

329
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:43,745
I'll talk to Soto.

330
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:56,490
So why did you agree
to do the documentary?

331
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:58,425
Sixteen years in that family,

332
00:15:58,459 --> 00:15:59,960
and I have nothing
to show for it

333
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:01,863
other than
a destroyed reputation.

334
00:16:02,797 --> 00:16:04,666
The Donovan prenup is criminal.

335
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:07,100
I tried to do right by them,
but enough is enough.

336
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:08,870
This is my story too.

337
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:10,738
I have a right to tell it
and sell it as I please.

338
00:16:10,772 --> 00:16:12,574
I won't let them
take away my moment.

339
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:16,878
Lieutenant says we already know
George's confession is a sham.

340
00:16:17,812 --> 00:16:19,547
So how about you tell us

341
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:21,415
why you think George's
confession is bogus

342
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,050
out of the goodness
of your heart.

343
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,486
You'll still screw the Donovans
over if you prove to the police

344
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,188
that the case isn't as closed as
the family would like it to be.

345
00:16:28,222 --> 00:16:30,792
You can help us bring
Barry's real killer to justice.

346
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,697
Fine. George called me up...

347
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,265
after he'd seen
that I'd signed on

348
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:39,601
to participate
in the documentary

349
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:40,802
a few weeks ago.

350
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:42,369
Begged me not to do it.

351
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,672
Said he wanted to spare
the family any more misery.

352
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:48,342
That was George. He hated
to see his people suffer.

353
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,144
He wouldn't have waited
ten years to confess

354
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,714
if he'd actually done it.

355
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:54,181
Okay.

356
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,718
If not George,
who do you think murdered Barry?

357
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:00,220
I don't know, but they would
all lie to protect each other.

358
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,726
You won't be able to break them.

359
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,030
[phone chimes]

360
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:14,201
[Morgan] <i>"Sauna at the End</i>
<i>of the Stairs"?</i>

361
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,570
Mmm, I'd watch it.

362
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,676
One of the people
in this family is a murderer.

363
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,645
-We have to figure out who--
-[Morgan] Hmm.

364
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:30,685
Welcome. To what do we owe
the pleasure?

365
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,567
Again, we're sorry
for your loss.

366
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,868
Why are you here?

367
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:48,937
I mean, we-we literally
just sprinkled

368
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,672
our dad's ashes
off of Point Dume.

369
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:52,239
I-I told them they could come.

370
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,510
-[sighs]
-Well, as I said on the phone,

371
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:57,545
we just have
a few follow-up questions

372
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:00,014
before we can officially
close the case.

373
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:01,983
Make sure the confession
wasn't coerced.

374
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:03,885
You think we had
a gun to his head?

375
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:07,287
No. No, we just have some I's
to dot and some T's to cross.

376
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:09,958
I'm sure your dad's confession
came as quite a shock.

377
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:12,060
I doubt Dad meant to kill Barry.

378
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,661
Was there any sense of relief?

379
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,564
I mean, the media hasn't exactly
been kind to you, guys.

380
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:18,833
So at least now
all the speculation will stop.

381
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:20,467
The speculation
that ruined our lives?

382
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,806
I mean, this whole thing
cost Clark a wife, me my career,

383
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,741
and Mom, you know,
her place in society.

384
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:30,410
Cody was being recruited
by MIT before the murder.

385
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:31,613
My nephew's a genius.

386
00:18:31,646 --> 00:18:33,246
Yeah. And now that genius
washes dishes.

387
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,651
Heather had to move. Matty's
all over the murder blogs.

388
00:18:36,684 --> 00:18:39,419
-Murder blogs?
-They call him
"Matty the Baddie."

389
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:42,289
Well, I, for one, think
that your divorce was

390
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,191
the only upside
of this whole thing.

391
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,259
Nedda's a piece of work.

392
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:49,764
Was there any friction between
Barry and George that night?

393
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:53,200
Well, there was one thing
by the pool before dinner.

394
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,536
You know, we were having some
lemonade by the pool with Dad

395
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,872
when, uh, Barry comes
out of the pool house,

396
00:18:57,905 --> 00:18:59,607
all ring around the nosey.

397
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:00,775
He was coked up?

398
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:03,477
Yeah. And Dad just freaked out.

399
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:06,246
You know, he was yelling
at Barry for bringing drugs
into the house.

400
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,017
Especially around
his no-good addict son. Mmm.

401
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,587
That's not what he thought,
Matty. My brother's in recovery.

402
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,288
Did Barry and George's fight by
the pool escalate any further?

403
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,424
They put aside
their differences,

404
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:20,128
momentarily at least,
so we could have a nice dinner.

405
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,562
And was it nice?

406
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:24,699
Well, we tried.

407
00:19:24,732 --> 00:19:28,102
[Heather] <i>It started</i>
<i>with another family photo</i>
<i>and then a toast.</i>

408
00:19:28,136 --> 00:19:29,637
-All right.
-To family,

409
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:33,141
looking after one another
in good times and bad.

410
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,776
<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>Matty started drinking.</i>

411
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:35,977
Is that a good idea, Son?

412
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,645
Come on,
Dad. I can handle one drink.

413
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,148
<i>It wasn't long before Barry</i>
<i>started offending everyone.</i>

414
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,916
I suppose you can let 'em
make their own mistakes.

415
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:43,885
-They know you'll bail them out.
<i>-And Dad got upset.</i>

416
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:45,753
Says Mr. Father of the Year.

417
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:47,287
<i>Cody had enough</i>
<i>and went upstairs.</i>

418
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,423
You know what? I'm not hungry.

419
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:51,092
<i>-And Matty let it out...</i>
-Please. Cody, stay.

420
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,794
<i>...that Barry and Clark</i>
<i>lost a lot of money.</i>

421
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:54,896
I don't know
if Dad can afford to send me
to rehab again, Barry.

422
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:56,931
Not after all that money
that he and Clark lost

423
00:19:56,964 --> 00:19:59,167
investing in your friend's
failed company.

424
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:02,202
You invested our money in what?

425
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,140
How did George react when Matty
brought up the bad investment?

426
00:20:06,174 --> 00:20:08,576
He really didn't
have time to react,

427
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:09,577
because of...

428
00:20:10,144 --> 00:20:11,612
Heather's mishap.

429
00:20:12,547 --> 00:20:14,949
-Oh, God.
-Oh, my God.
Bunny, are you hurt?

430
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:17,484
Sorry, new here.
Heather caught on fire?

431
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:18,720
We knew about that.

432
00:20:18,753 --> 00:20:20,054
Melon didn't think
it was important enough

433
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:21,723
to even include
in the case report.

434
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:24,025
We put it out right away.
I was okay.

435
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:26,493
Just clumsy, as usual.

436
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:28,261
What happened after that?

437
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:31,165
Barry decided he'd had enough.
He headed upstairs.

438
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,902
And then we cleared the table
and set up the Monopoly board.

439
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,705
[Heather] <i>Monopoly comes out.</i>

440
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:38,940
<i>Cody returned.</i>

441
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:40,474
-Look who decided to show up.
-What's up, bud?

442
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:42,375
<i>-He loves that game.</i>
-Welcome back, Cody.

443
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,011
-I knew you couldn't resist.
<i>-But then,</i>

444
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:46,480
<i>-Barry puts his TV</i>
<i>on full blast.</i>
-I'm the race car.

445
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:48,216
[through TV] <i>I hope you die!</i>

446
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,250
-What the hell
is he watching up there?
<i>-And Dad was not happy.</i>

447
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:52,587
I'm going to kill that bastard.

448
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:55,022
George threatened
to murder Barry?

449
00:20:55,056 --> 00:20:57,424
Why sound surprised?
We sent you his confession.

450
00:20:58,025 --> 00:20:59,392
Where was Nedda
during all of this?

451
00:21:00,828 --> 00:21:02,764
Probably checking
her social media.

452
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,102
-Where was I?
-You just told us
Heather caught on fire,

453
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:10,838
and then you needed
to check your Instagram.

454
00:21:10,872 --> 00:21:12,240
Right. Yes.

455
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:15,308
That is why you do not wear
bell sleeves to dinner.

456
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,613
So we quickly tore off her wrap,

457
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,083
and that's
when we saw the bruises.

458
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:28,388
[voicemail] <i>This is Karadec.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

459
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:31,826
-Karadec isn't picking up.
-Okay. Well, call Soto, then.

460
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:33,326
All right. [sighs]

461
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,328
[line dialing]

462
00:21:39,934 --> 00:21:42,003
What the hell is Nedda Donovan
doing here?

463
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:50,611
You're sure
that's what she said, Oz?

464
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:52,013
Barry abused Heather?

465
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,447
Yeah, okay.

466
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,516
What?

467
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,350
Melon saw her?

468
00:21:59,053 --> 00:22:00,154
Okay, bye.

469
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:01,889
[Selena sighs]

470
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,793
The Donovans lied to us.
Barry was beating Heather.

471
00:22:05,827 --> 00:22:08,162
They learned this when
they stripped off Heather's wrap

472
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:09,997
and discovered
she was covered in bruises.

473
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:12,133
That's a strong motive
for murder for any of 'em.

474
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:14,367
I can see
why they kept it a secret.

475
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:16,871
[Selena] And why that secret
would've ruined their charity.

476
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:21,742
Melon saw Nedda at the station.
Our time is running out.

477
00:22:21,776 --> 00:22:24,411
Selena, maybe we should call
this off. You've gone rogue.

478
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,614
I don't wanna be answering
to Melon if you get reassigned.

479
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:29,482
I don't want that either.
So let's solve this case.

480
00:22:30,918 --> 00:22:32,019
[Karadec scoffs]

481
00:22:34,522 --> 00:22:36,591
Was anyone planning
on telling us

482
00:22:36,624 --> 00:22:38,659
about the moment
during Thanksgiving dinner

483
00:22:38,693 --> 00:22:40,895
when you learned
Barry was beating Heather?

484
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:46,366
Nedda.

485
00:22:47,268 --> 00:22:48,736
It was a family matter.

486
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:51,072
And some things need to stay
in the family.

487
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:52,607
In a murder investigation?

488
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,374
Can we please not talk
about this?

489
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:55,509
It'll be okay, Mom.

490
00:22:57,645 --> 00:23:00,413
It was after Heather's sleeve
caught on fire.

491
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,586
-[screams, grunts]
-[Clark] <i>We put out the fire,</i>

492
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,487
<i>and that's when we saw</i>
<i>what Barry was doing to her.</i>

493
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:09,924
-We need to get this off you.
-No, Mom. I'm okay. I'm fine.

494
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:12,093
[Lenore] Honey.

495
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:16,631
-What happened?
-What the hell?

496
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:18,599
-You bastard.
-How dare you?

497
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:19,867
You think I did that?

498
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:22,303
[Clark] <i>Barry denied it</i>
<i>and stormed out.</i>

499
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:23,571
I'm done here. I'm done.

500
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:25,806
Did anyone see Barry again
after that?

501
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:28,576
I did.

502
00:23:29,377 --> 00:23:31,812
[Lenore] <i>I was having a glass</i>
<i>of wine while cleaning up</i>

503
00:23:31,846 --> 00:23:33,915
<i>when he came down the stairs</i>
<i>in his robe...</i>

504
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:38,085
<i>headed for the sauna.</i>

505
00:23:39,553 --> 00:23:41,389
How much did you have to drink?

506
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:44,125
I had some wine.
I can't remember how much.

507
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:48,029
Well, it's a good thing
Barry's already dead.

508
00:23:48,062 --> 00:23:49,664
I'd like to murder him myself.

509
00:23:49,697 --> 00:23:51,132
Assuming Morgan's theory
is correct,

510
00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:53,534
everyone but the killer probably
thinks Barry was still alive

511
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,569
-when Lenore says she saw him.
-Well, let's divide 'em up.

512
00:23:55,603 --> 00:23:57,738
Get everyone's account
of the hours
between dinner and midnight.

513
00:23:57,772 --> 00:23:59,273
-Establish a time line.
-Yeah.

514
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:00,341
Okay.

515
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:07,148
So why don't you walk us through
what happened after dinner?

516
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:09,850
Heather couldn't sleep
in the same room as Barry.

517
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:11,619
George and Lenore
wouldn't have allowed it.

518
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:14,522
So I offered to go grab
her stuff from the room

519
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:16,624
while Lenore helped her
get into new clothes.

520
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:19,994
[Nedda] <i>Barry was watching TV</i>
<i>when I went to his room.</i>

521
00:24:20,027 --> 00:24:21,395
She needs her stuff.

522
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:23,898
<i>-He flipped and threw it at me.</i>
-Take it, okay?

523
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:25,700
Oh, my...

524
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:28,035
-Take her crap.
Take her crap. Okay.
-You're such an asshole, Barry.

525
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:30,638
That was the last time
I ever saw him.

526
00:24:33,074 --> 00:24:35,443
You understand why I have to ask
about the abuse?

527
00:24:36,811 --> 00:24:38,412
Why didn't you go to the police?

528
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,548
I thought he'd change.

529
00:24:41,582 --> 00:24:42,616
Plus, I was ashamed.

530
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:45,553
Is that why you never went
to the hospital?

531
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:47,855
I was a nurse
before Cody was born.

532
00:24:49,457 --> 00:24:51,425
I could deal
with the injuries myself.

533
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:52,593
My aunt was a nurse.

534
00:24:53,561 --> 00:24:55,763
She was
always throwing out her back,

535
00:24:55,796 --> 00:24:57,565
all that heavy lifting
you have to do,

536
00:24:57,598 --> 00:24:59,033
moving patients around.

537
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:01,669
They train nurses to do that,
don't they?

538
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:03,004
What are you trying to imply?

539
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:04,705
It's okay, honey.

540
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:08,476
Yes, that's part
of the training.

541
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:15,249
And by then, Cody had hotels
on Boardwalk and Park Place.

542
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:16,984
He was dominating us as usual.

543
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:19,420
And that's when Barry switched
from a war movie

544
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:22,289
to a... dirty movie.

545
00:25:23,491 --> 00:25:25,593
[through TV]
<i>Did someone order pizza?</i>

546
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:29,430
<i>Matty and Clark volunteered</i>
<i>to stop it.</i>

547
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:31,265
Come on, Matty.
Let's handle this.

548
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:34,168
<i>And I asked them to grab</i>
<i>the Christmas decorations</i>
<i>for me as well.</i>

549
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:35,836
Did you hear the TV
come back on again

550
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,104
after your sons went upstairs?

551
00:25:37,138 --> 00:25:38,806
No, don't believe so.

552
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:42,043
-How long were they gone?
-30 minutes or so.

553
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:45,746
<i>Little wuss locked himself in,</i>

554
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,482
but we got Barry to turn the TV
off after a few choice words.

555
00:25:48,517 --> 00:25:49,917
So you threatened him?

556
00:25:50,684 --> 00:25:52,686
We banged on his door a bit.
That's all.

557
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,156
[stammers] We didn't kill him,
if that's what you're asking.

558
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:58,092
I didn't even see him again.
Not alive at least.

559
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:00,227
After that, Matty and I headed
to the attic

560
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:01,562
for Mom's Christmas decorations.

561
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:03,030
How long were you upstairs?

562
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:04,799
Half hour, maybe.

563
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:06,333
Both of you?

564
00:26:07,902 --> 00:26:09,437
I may have given Matty
a little grief

565
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,938
for drinking in front of Dad.

566
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:13,508
At some point, he disappeared
and left me with all the...

567
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:15,609
heavy boxes.

568
00:26:16,277 --> 00:26:19,447
Matty left you alone
in the attic? For how long?

569
00:26:20,515 --> 00:26:21,615
Fifteen minutes.

570
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:23,884
Maybe 20.

571
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:32,527
Matty and Clark were each alone
for enough time

572
00:26:32,561 --> 00:26:34,061
to sneak off and murder Barry.

573
00:26:34,095 --> 00:26:35,830
Mm-hmm.
One of them could be our guy.

574
00:26:35,863 --> 00:26:37,631
Or they were lying
about being in the attic,

575
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:39,066
and they both murdered him
together.

576
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:45,239
[Nedda] So going back
to the attic.

577
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:48,109
Lenore knows the smell of fake
pine gives me a headache,

578
00:26:48,142 --> 00:26:51,846
and yet she insists on lighting
those scented Christmas candles

579
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:53,280
every year for the ambience.

580
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:55,483
What does Lenore's candles
have to do with the murder?

581
00:26:55,517 --> 00:26:57,118
If you'd let me finish.

582
00:26:58,085 --> 00:27:00,589
So Lenore likes to light
her scented Christmas candles.

583
00:27:00,654 --> 00:27:03,691
<i>And I had to leave the house.</i>
<i>Get some fresh air.</i>

584
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:05,025
[exhales heavily]

585
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:07,695
<i>And I saw Billy Ross</i>
<i>selling drugs to Matty.</i>

586
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:13,934
So Ross did show up at the house
that night but not for Barry.

587
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:15,669
He came to see Matty.

588
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:17,506
Matty the Baddie.

589
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:21,041
A former drug addict who was
furious at his brother-in-law

590
00:27:21,075 --> 00:27:23,711
and was getting coked up right
at the time of Barry's death.

591
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:25,746
Makes for a killer doc, huh?

592
00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:32,052
All right. Thanks.

593
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:38,225
Daphne and Oz got some
interesting news from Nedda.

594
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:40,761
She says she saw Matty Donovan
meeting Billy Ross

595
00:27:40,794 --> 00:27:42,129
in front of the house,
when he told us

596
00:27:42,163 --> 00:27:43,931
he was in the attic.

597
00:27:43,964 --> 00:27:46,066
-He went to meet
the coke dealer?
-Yep.

598
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,736
George's lawyers were right
about Ross coming to the house.

599
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:51,105
But there was
no drug-deal-gone-wrong.

600
00:27:51,138 --> 00:27:54,341
If Ross came to see Matty,
he had no motive
for killing Barry.

601
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,976
Mmm. That probably explains

602
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,711
why Nedda didn't mention it
at trial.

603
00:27:57,745 --> 00:27:59,980
One more thing.
Daphne also said she just saw

604
00:28:00,014 --> 00:28:01,382
Melon and the captain
leaving the station.

605
00:28:01,415 --> 00:28:05,085
[sighs] If you have any ideas,
feel free to speak up.

606
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,954
Yes. I know. I don't.

607
00:28:06,987 --> 00:28:08,455
Just give me a second.
I need to rewind a little bit.

608
00:28:08,489 --> 00:28:10,257
There's just
so many moving pieces.

609
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:14,695
Okay. We know that everyone was
together at dinner. Around 8:00.

610
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:17,731
Cody leaves when George
and Barry start fighting.

611
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:19,099
-I'm not hungry.
-Please. Cody, stay.

612
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:22,504
Barry leaves when everybody
calls him out

613
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:24,506
-for beating Heather.
-I'm done here. I'm done.

614
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,809
[Morgan] <i>Heather decides</i>
<i>she still wants to have</i>
<i>family game night,</i>

615
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:32,112
because moms hold on
to tradition
like a life raft in a storm.

616
00:28:32,713 --> 00:28:36,717
But first,
Heather, Lenore and Nedda
go upstairs around 9:00.

617
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:39,521
Heather and Lenore go
into Lenore's room to change.

618
00:28:39,554 --> 00:28:42,691
Nedda goes to grab Heather's
stuff from Barry's room...

619
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:44,358
-Take her crap.
-You're such an asshole, Barry.

620
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:46,595
<i>...where she sees him alive</i>
<i>for the last time.</i>

621
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:50,632
Lenore and Heather go back
downstairs to start game night.

622
00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:54,068
Cody comes downstairs
from his room. Monopoly begins.

623
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:56,036
[clock chimes]

624
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,373
Until Barry starts
blasting porn on his TV,

625
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:02,476
causing Matty and Clark to go
upstairs and bang on his door.

626
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,311
But then Barry turns the TV off,

627
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:06,648
so Matty and Clark instead
go up to the attic

628
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:08,382
to get Lenore's Christmas boxes.

629
00:29:10,117 --> 00:29:12,886
That's when Matty leaves Clark
to go meet the coke dealer.

630
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,623
<i>So Clark is alone in the attic.</i>

631
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:17,992
Then both brothers reconvene
back downstairs

632
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:19,860
at the game board
around the same time.

633
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:22,196
Monopoly ends.

634
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:24,431
Everybody goes to bed,
except for Lenore,

635
00:29:24,465 --> 00:29:25,766
<i>who finishes cleaning up</i>
<i>in the tea room.</i>

636
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,134
Because, again, moms being moms.

637
00:29:28,035 --> 00:29:30,104
And that's when she sees Barry
go down to the basement.

638
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:33,608
But we know Barry
was killed upstairs,

639
00:29:34,408 --> 00:29:37,712
and we know it wasn't Lenore,
Heather or Nedda

640
00:29:37,746 --> 00:29:40,214
because Barry was alive
before Monopoly even began.

641
00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:42,449
But then
the porn turned off, what...

642
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:46,387
[grunts] Damn it.

643
00:29:48,022 --> 00:29:49,490
[Pacheco] Please forgive
the intrusion...

644
00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:51,392
[Selena] I hear Captain Pacheco.

645
00:29:51,425 --> 00:29:52,793
No.

646
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:54,763
Whew.

647
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:56,330
[Morgan stammers, grunts]
Just...

648
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:58,767
We were hoping
to let you rest this day,

649
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,100
but I'm afraid
I'm going to have to...

650
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:01,168
[Selena] Captain.

651
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:04,405
There you are.
Would you excuse us?

652
00:30:06,206 --> 00:30:08,309
Did you think I wasn't gonna
find out about this?

653
00:30:09,443 --> 00:30:11,979
[scoffs] You put
this entire case at risk.

654
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:13,480
And the department.

655
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:15,983
What in God's name
were you thinking?

656
00:30:17,318 --> 00:30:18,520
And, Mrs. Donovan,

657
00:30:18,553 --> 00:30:20,722
please, you have
my utmost apologies

658
00:30:20,755 --> 00:30:22,524
for this intrusion
on your day of mourning.

659
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:32,701
And, Lieutenant?
This cleaning lady experiment
of yours...

660
00:30:33,434 --> 00:30:34,902
[Lenore echoing] <i>And that's</i>
<i>when Barry switched</i>

661
00:30:34,935 --> 00:30:36,805
<i>from a war movie</i>
<i>to a dirty movie.</i>

662
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:39,239
-It's officially over.
-Captain, this experiment
has been--

663
00:30:39,273 --> 00:30:41,041
-Lieutenant.
-Yeah.

664
00:30:42,943 --> 00:30:44,044
I know who did it.

665
00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:58,626
Captain Pacheco,
when you investigated

666
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,128
Barry's death ten years ago,
you focused on the events

667
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:03,497
that happened after midnight,
correct?

668
00:31:03,531 --> 00:31:04,965
We knew
the murder happened then.

669
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:08,469
Lenore saw Barry go
into the basement at midnight.

670
00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:11,806
Right. So that would make
perfect sense, you know.

671
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,006
Unless Lenore was wrong.

672
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,042
-What?
-Are you saying my mother lied?

673
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:16,443
No. Absolutely not.

674
00:31:16,477 --> 00:31:20,447
I'm asking what if Lenore
thought she saw Barry, right?

675
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:22,182
I mean, she admitted
to tipping back a few.

676
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:23,984
I know what I saw.

677
00:31:24,017 --> 00:31:26,453
Barry passed me on his way
down to the basement.

678
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:29,524
Well, Barry's bathrobe
went down to the basement. Yes.

679
00:31:29,557 --> 00:31:30,859
But Barry wasn't in it.

680
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:34,161
Because Barry was killed
before midnight upstairs.

681
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,832
Uh... So-so let me
get this straight.

682
00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:40,535
You're saying the killer
murdered Barry somewhere else,

683
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:44,004
then dragged his body
from the second floor
to the basement

684
00:31:44,037 --> 00:31:46,674
right past the entire family
playing Monopoly?

685
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:49,977
No. I'm saying the killer tossed
Barry's body

686
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,547
down the laundry chute,
breaking his neck
in the process.

687
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,982
-The laundry chute?
-What the hell?

688
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:56,383
What is going on?

689
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:58,586
No way a body fits down
that chute. There's no way.

690
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,754
Ida Perp did.

691
00:31:59,788 --> 00:32:01,689
Ida Perp is not a living person.

692
00:32:01,723 --> 00:32:02,891
And neither was Barry.

693
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:08,228
Because Cody electrocuted him
in the shower

694
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:10,732
before the family even began
playing Monopoly.

695
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:23,410
You knew what your dad was doing
to your mom. Kids always know.

696
00:32:24,411 --> 00:32:26,413
You were just trying to protect
her any way you knew how.

697
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:28,282
-[Clark] What are you saying?
-[Matty] You need to leave,
all right?

698
00:32:28,315 --> 00:32:31,084

accusations?
-Who do you think you are?

Please. Look, look.
I don't believe this
any more than you do.

He was 15. You really think
a teenager could pull that off?

701
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,093
Cody wasn't a regular teenager.
He was a genius.

as a sophomore.

was beating his mother.

705
00:32:48,803 --> 00:32:51,906
So picture Cody knowing
what he knows about his dad.

706
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,340

<i>So he has to come up</i>

719
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:42,624
<i>He sends Barry's body</i>
<i>down the laundry chute.</i>

720
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,326

721
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:49,463

723
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:55,603

730

<i>and he leaves the robe behind.</i>

733
00:34:28,703 --> 00:34:31,906
Cody had no idea that the fall
had broken his father's neck.

734

Or that Barry's blood got
onto his grandfather's shirt

This is ludicrous.
My son is not a murderer.

741
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:52,392
He was playing Monopoly
the whole night.

742
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:55,997
And Barry was still alive.
He was watching TV, remember?

743
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,600
And channels just don't change
on their own.

744
00:34:58,633 --> 00:34:59,834
Channels don't.

745
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:02,402
But George
and Lenore's televisions

746
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:04,471
use radio frequency remotes.

747
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:08,375
Meaning...

748
00:35:08,408 --> 00:35:10,845
Well, it depends what kind of
range you want for your remote.

749
00:35:10,878 --> 00:35:13,014
Infrared remotes get
the job done for the most part

750
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:16,316
but require a direct line of
sight from the remote to the TV.

more thought.

777
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:32,927
A week later,
he makes that video confessing.

778
