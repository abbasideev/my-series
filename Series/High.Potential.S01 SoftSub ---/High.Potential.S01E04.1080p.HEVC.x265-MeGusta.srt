1
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,580
Okay.

2
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,420
Well, hello, sunshine.

3
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,910
Hi.

4
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,880
You gonna tell me why
you're in such a good mood?

5
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,500
- Or do I have to ask?
- My goodness.

6
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,910
Thank you so much for noticing.

7
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,640
No big deal. Just, any
moment, Robert from hr

8
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,680
is going to walk through these doors
and hand me my very own badge.

9
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,300
You're excited about your ID badge?

10
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,300
Training wheels are coming off, buddy.

11
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
I'm not so sure.

12
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,620
I'm pretty sure about that.

13
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,000
- First the LAPD mug...
- actually, that's mine.

14
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,620
And now, my very own badge.

15
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,590
Your vote of confidence
is not lost on me.

16
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,596
But nobody panic, I don't
plan on rooting around

17
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,900
in the evidence locker too much.

18
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,396
Well, that's good, because your ID badge

19
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,226
does not provide access
to said evidence locker.

20
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,180
Sure about that?

21
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,430
Let me get back to you. Bob. Bob's here.

22
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,150
- Can I call you Bob?
- No.

23
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,710
Sign here, please.

24
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,120
Coming right at me with the fine print.

25
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,370
That's "use of service, limitation
of liability, dispute resolution"

26
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,020
you need to sign for the badge.

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,410
You know what, Robert?

28
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,130
I will make you a deal, okay?

29
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,650
I won't sign that, but what
I will do is take my badge.

30
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,340
- Yep. There she goes.
- You

31
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,310
- she can't...
- She did.

32
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,160
You okay?

33
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,230
Yeah, I'm I'm fine.

34
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,370
You ever have one of those days

35
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,376
where you just feel like
you're losing your mind?

36
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,030
Are there other kinds of days?

37
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,100
What's going on?

38
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,760
It's my girls. Their father was
supposed to drop them off last night,

39
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,310
but he never showed up.

40
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,900
I call, I text.

41
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,490
I thought maybe they
would be at his house, but.

42
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,420
I just wanna know they're okay. But

43
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,980
but you have a bad feeling?

44
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,430
I thought I'd come in here
and try to get it together

45
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,400
before I talk to the detectives.

46
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,470
And my dad's on his way.

47
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,410
I'm probably just overreacting, right?

48
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,030
I think

49
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,280
that wherever your girls
are, we're gonna find 'em.

50
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,900
Mia, when's the last time
you saw your daughters?

51
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,770
Yesterday, when
Wendell picked them up.

52
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,290
He's my ex-husband.

53
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,220
You should've never
agreed to shared custody

54
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,870
before the divorce was finalized.

55
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,120
Dad, he's their father.

56
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,640
He has a right to see them.

57
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,700
You guys went camping at mount baldy?

58
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,330
Yes, last summer. Wendell took us.

59
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,260
That was right before we split.

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,990
Was there a reason for the split?

61
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,726
Wendell started reading about
everything going on with the planet.

62
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,310
The temperatures rising,
icebergs melting. Deforestation.

63
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,620
Loss of biodiversity, industrial
waste, ocean acidification.

64
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,350
You sound just like him.

65
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,070
Yeah. What Mia is too nice to say
is that Wendell became a radical.

66
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,320
A radical?

67
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,320
Yeah. He became obsessed
with environmentalism.

68
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,340
Look, I'm all for electric
cars and composting,

69
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,630
but you know, he just took it too far.

70
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,430
He wanted Mia and the
girls to live completely off-grid.

71
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,920
Told Ellie and Paige that
everything was poisoned. Water, food

72
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,540
I mean, these are kids
we're talking about here.

73
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,370
He's not a monster.

74
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,820
The man decided to grow a garden
rather than take care of his own family.

75
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,510
Wendell and I had a
small online business,

76
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,170
but you kinda need to
be on the grid for that.

77
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,180
Thankfully, my father was able to help.

78
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,730
She moved in with us.

79
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,310
Did Wendell ever talk about
taking the girls out of the city?

80
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,110
All the time. He bought
a cabin out in upland.

81
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,840
Said he wanted to become
one with nature, live off the land

82
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,260
could we stop talking now and
start looking for my granddaughters?

83
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,880
Mr. Ashford, we cannot
put out an Amber alert

84
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,300
until the girls have been
missing for at least 24 hours.

85
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,960
What we can do is issue
a bolo for Wendell's car

86
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,540
and we can visit the home.

87
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,930
Mia, do you think there's any
chance he might harm them?

88
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,690
I honestly don't know.

89
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,110
State department says Wendell
Dunn applied for two minor passports

90
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,320
last month for Ellie and Paige.

91
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,618
If the guy got his dream
house in the country

92
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:26,746
do we really believe he'd leave it behind?

93
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,956
He might've if he thought
he was about to lose custody.

94
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,360
According to this report
from child protective services,

95
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,570
Wendell was found to be unstable
and could be a danger to his daughters.

96
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,850
All right. Call TSA, and check
flight manifests and border crossings.

97
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,626
Maybe he wanted to take these
girls out of more than just the city.

98
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,650
- I'll go check his house.
- Don't forget Morgan.

99
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,990
How could I?

100
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,410
- Can I be totally honest?
- Please.

101
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,350
I've only worked here for a couple weeks,

102
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,630
but I've studied the people
in this building closely.

103
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,536
I know that pit in your
stomach's not going anywhere

104
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,630
until your girls are back,

105
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,460
but I promise you, you're in good hands.

106
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,370
- Make sure she eats something.
- Of course.

107
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,540
Gillory. Field trip.

108
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,230
We're going to Wendell Dunn's house.

109
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,490
Well, look at this. Solar
panels, rain barrels, compost bin.

110
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,830
This Wendell guy
really is an eco warrior?

111
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,390
No. Do you see this?

112
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,810
Ellie was holding this in
one of the pictures I saw.

113
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,546
And it was a professional photo,
which means it's probably her favorite.

114
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,966
So she wouldn't have left it behind
unless she didn't have a choice.

115
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,710
No. She wouldn't.

116
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,990
Hello?

117
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,380
Mr. Dunn?

118
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,860
Detective karadec, LAPD.

119
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,860
Guy cans his own jam.

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,350
Who knows what he's capable of?

121
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,520
All clear.

122
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,730
Mr. Dunn must've left in a hurry?

123
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,970
Maybe. My kids don't love clearing
their plates under any circumstances.

124
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,500
A greenhouse.

125
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,710
Well, he's got peppers and zucchini.

126
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,500
Malabar spinach, cucamelon, per ill a.

127
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,300
I get it. You know your vegetables.

128
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,200
Most of those are fruits,
thank you very much.

129
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,480
Elliot went through

130
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,720
a bit of a permaculture
phase last summer.

131
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,836
I'll leave the gardening to
you guys. Not really my thing.

132
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,216
Come on, Morgan, the clock's ticking.

133
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,730
Wendell planted cucumbers
and tomatoes next to each other?

134
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,620
Are you critiquing our
suspect's garden now?

135
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,610
Cucumbers and tomatoes
are not companion plants.

136
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,730
<i>Wendell would never
plant them side by side.</i>

137
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,310
They compete for the same nutrients,

138
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,250
they have completely
different watering needs.

139
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,570
Which might explain
why they're not thriving.

140
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,400
Okay. Are you saying that you think

141
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,670
Wendell made a mistake in the
way that he arranged this garden?

142
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,510
No, he wouldn't do that.
You saw how he lives.

143
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,240
These haven't even rooted yet.

144
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,900
What're you saying, Morgan?

145
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,420
I think this space was empty

146
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,186
<i>until Wendell moved all these
plants in here within the last few days.</i>

147
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,876
You just said that he would never do that.

148
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,560
Yeah, he wouldn't. Unless he
had a reason. Something to hide.

149
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,360
Or someone.

150
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,220
Wendell didn't have anything to hide.

151
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,500
Someone else did.

152
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,400
Him.

153
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,580
Come on. Sniff. Sniff.

154
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,680
Good boy. Good.

155
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,566
Looks like cause of death was
a blow to the back of the head.

156
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,380
- And that's our murder weapon?
- Indeed.

157
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,310
Medical examiner thinks Wendell
died sometime in the last 12 hours.

158
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,970
Have them rush autopsy and tool
Mark analysis just to make sure.

159
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,776
If whoever killed Wendell
kidnapped those girls,

160
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,266
they could be halfway
across the country.

161
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,940
- No sign of the girls anywhere?
- No.

162
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,126
We didn't see disturbed soil
anywhere else on the property,

163
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,616
so I think the girls were taken alive.

164
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
And now our primary suspect is dead.

165
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,860
If the girls saw their father murdered,

166
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,580
it's possible that the killer's
holding them to keep them quiet.

167
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,960
Or the killer came for the
girls and the dad got in the way.

168
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,030
- Hey.
- Anything door-to-door?

169
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,356
No. The neighbors are too far
to have heard or seen anything.

170
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,930
So, I went to the café
where Wendell sells veggies.

171
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,450
The owner saw him in an
argument with a woman yesterday.

172
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,210
- You got a name?
- Only a description.

173
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,460
She's 30s, long red hair, glasses.

174
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,560
Maybe Wendell got a new girlfriend.

175
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,226
I don't know about that. The
guy's still wearing his wedding ring.

176
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,840
Like that ever stopped anybody.

177
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,640
Check this out.

178
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,066
Morgan found this photo hidden
in Wendell's survivalist handbook.

179
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,290
Maybe it's his parents?

180
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,020
- Find out.
- Okay.

181
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,750
I'll see if Mia's family knows a
woman who fits the description.

182
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,920
Hold on.

183
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,480
You put out an Amber alert
for the girls 30 minutes ago.

184
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,170
I did.

185
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,690
You know all Amber
alerts go through me.

186
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,520
- Why'd you break protocol?
- Every second counts.

187
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,320
- She's rubbing off on you.
- Who?

188
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,520
Who do you think?

189
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,740
You all right?

190
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,780
"Don't wait for the crisis to
arrive. Assume it's already here.

191
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,330
'Cause what we do by choice
today may be a necessity tomorrow."

192
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,400
That man just wanted his
girls to be prepared for anything.

193
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,696
There's nothing in this
book that can teach you

194
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,130
how to survive losing your father.

195
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,650
Yeah. There's nothing
that can prepare you for that.

196
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,590
You guys see those
fresh tire tracks out there?

197
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,930
We're trying to determine
the type of vehicle.

198
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,730
Good.

199
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,226
Because if Ellie and Paige were taken
by a stranger and not a family member,

200
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,940
their odds of being found
alive just dropped 42%.

201
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,400
<i>Looking at the over-under</i>

202
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,260
Jon ashford. Owns
ashford luxury estates.

203
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,330
It's a global portfolio of luxury hotels.

204
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,270
Are we sure this isn't one of 'em?

205
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,270
No wonder Mia wanted
to move back home.

206
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,286
Well, her father's a very wealthy man.
Which means we can't rule out a ransom.

207
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,070
And he hated Wendell, so we
can't rule him out as a suspect.

208
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,240
Right.

209
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,940
That's too many balconies.

210
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,840
I can't believe that he's dead.

211
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,910
Do you think he was murdered?

212
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,050
We know so. Sir, we
found him this morning.

213
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,330
My condolences.

214
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,950
Wait, if the girls aren't
with him, where are they?

215
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,330
- What does this mean?
- We hope to have more leads soon.

216
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,110
The day he died,
Wendell was seen arguing

217
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,750
with a woman with long
red hair, glasses, in her 30s.

218
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,650
Any idea who that might've been?

219
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm sorry, no.

220
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,270
Can you excuse me for a moment?

221
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,170
I'm gonna use your
restroom, if that's okay.

222
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,940
You're good.

223
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,740
Thank you.

224
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,810
Mr. and Mrs. Ashford like to
collect expensive things, don't they?

225
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,990
They do.

226
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,440
You know what I think?

227
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,340
I think we should teach
them how to share.

228
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,000
- Just a sip.
- Just a sip.

229
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,180
If you think of anything or hear
from anyone, call me. Day or night.

230
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,180
- We will.
- I'll be in touch when we know more.

231
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,460
Thank you.

232
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,010
It's pretty sad about Wendell, right?

233
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,640
Yeah. He was a sweet man.

234
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,470
Was he? Just not a good father?

235
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,500
No. He adored those girls.

236
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,750
Really?

237
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,006
Did you know him well? Did
you spend a lot of time with him?

238
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,160
Yeah.

239
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,380
Last weekend he swung by to get
homework Paige forgot in her room.

240
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,690
I went upstairs to get it,
and when I came back down,

241
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,560
I saw him coming out
of Mr. Ashford's office.

242
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,010
- What do you think he was doing in there?
- I don't know.

243
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,700
Let's go.

244
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,816
<i>The disappearance of the
ashford sisters - thank you.</i>

245
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,120
<i>Has left the community
in a state of shock.</i>

246
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,716
Well, that was fast. Normally it
takes these anchors longer to catch on.

247
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,260
I called in a favor. Hopefully it pays off.

248
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,880
Oz. How we doing?

249
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,540
Over a hundred calls
and no credible leads.

250
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,230
So these girls have
been missing for 15 hours,

251
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,930
and all we have is a description
of a red-haired woman

252
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,836
who had a fight with our
victim the day he died?

253
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,100
And she had glasses.

254
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,240
Spectacles.

255
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,590
Where is it? It was right here.

256
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,730
Did someone take my report
from child protective services?

257
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,460
Special k.

258
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,506
- Can we not call me that?
- I don't love it either.

259
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,390
Did you read the cps report
from Wendell's custody dispute?

260
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,570
None of it's true. It says
he was raising the girls

261
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,260
with dietary deficiencies,
feeding them junk.

262
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,060
<i>You saw that garden.</i>

263
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,866
Ever heard of a parent who wants
to hog all the veggies for themselves?

264
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,270
It doesn't make any sense.

265
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,890
Skip ahead to "insufficient
educational environment."

266
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,200
<i>What was insufficient
about it? Not enough iPads?</i>

267
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,900
If Wendell Dunn was a bad
parent, what does that make me?

268
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,100
Tell me I'm wrong.

269
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,240
You're not wrong.

270
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,280
Wendell never mistreated
those girls. They loved him.

271
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,970
The maid loved him. I
mean, I think I love him.

272
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,830
The only person who
seems to have hated him

273
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,700
was the social worker
who wrote those lies.

274
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,810
Sarah Keller.

275
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,220
Nice glasses.

276
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,160
<i>The girls have been
missing for over 16 hours</i>

277
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,276
<i>no suspects or further
details - Ellie and Paige</i>

278
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,920
<i>is doing everything in their
power to find these girls.</i>

279
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,100
Thanks for talking to us today, Sarah.

280
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,960
Did you hear about Wendell Dunn?

281
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,890
Yeah, it was all over the news.

282
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,790
Do you know what happened to him?

283
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,496
Well, that's why we're here. You
wrote a pretty severe cps report on him.

284
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
Very severe.

285
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,660
- I'm sorry, who is she?
- Morgan.

286
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,430
My job at cps is to assess
risk and anticipate incidents

287
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,670
in order to keep all
kids out of harm's way.

288
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,950
I see. That must be a big responsibility.

289
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,120
Very big.

290
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
Yeah, it is.

291
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,300
Boy.

292
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,850
I sure have gotten a
few of these in my day.

293
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,720
Makes it hard not to hate
the mailman, doesn't it?

294
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,170
I also can't help but notice you
and I buy the same dish soap.

295
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,450
Only $2.95 with tax.

296
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,490
And that tells me that you're
short on cash, just like me.

297
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,840
And yet, you were just
able to take a trip to kauai.

298
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,940
What makes you think that?

299
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,810
Well, the lei still has fresh green
berries from the mokihana plant,

300
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,160
<i>native to the island.</i>

301
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,996
See, I've only ever been
able to travel there in my mind,

302
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,500
'cause like I just said, I'm
typically pretty broke, you know?

303
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,370
Quick question, and please feel free

304
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,480
to not answer this one
without an attorney present,

305
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:44,380
how comfy are those super soft
slippers at a luxury five-star resort?

306
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,900
Geez, I just I wonder what
the "a" could possibly stand for?

307
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,326
Why did you write all those mean
things about that super sweet dead guy?

308
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,980
Did that rich old man give
you a stay at one of his hotels

309
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,870
in exchange for you making his
son-in-law look like a crazy person,

310
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,880
when really he's just a very loving father

311
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,710
who wanted what was best for
his girls and the entire planet?

312
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,880
Do I need a lawyer?

313
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,260
I mean, yeah.

314
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,270
We know you and Wendell
had an argument yesterday.

315
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,890
Mr. Ashford knows a lot of people.

316
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,006
If I hadn't done what he
said, I could've lost my job.

317
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,240
And if Wendell had reported
you, you would've lost it too, right?

318
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,450
You think that I killed him?

319
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,730
Tell us why we shouldn't.

320
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,490
Wendell asked to meet me.

321
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,670
He said he was gonna go
public about what Mr. Ashford did.

322
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,220
I said I would write a
new report, but he refused.

323
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,360
He said that his father-in-law
bought out a lot of people

324
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,740
and that it was time to stop.

325
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,686
Wait, I'm sorry. So,
Mr. Ashford bribed others?

326
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,680
Wendell said he had
evidence to bring him down.

327
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,370
Stop him from destroying the
planet with any more hotels.

328
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:51,860
I tried to change his mind,
but I couldn't. So, I I left.

329
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,550
Keep using your words.

330
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,280
I told Mr. Ashford what
Wendell was planning to do.

331
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,120
And what exactly did you
think Mr. Ashford would do?

332
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,160
You should be out
looking for Paige and Ellie,

333
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,500
not whatever this is.

334
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,780
He wasn't even here
last night. Tell him, Curtis.

335
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,160
We had to drive to one of
his properties in San Diego.

336
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,790
We weren't back until 10:00.

337
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,270
- How was traffic?
- Bad.

338
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,380
Traffic's always bad.

339
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,570
Do you have one of
those tickets from the toll?

340
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,170
No. Fast pass.

341
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,790
Yeah, write down your make and
model. We'll check the cameras.

342
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,296
Or you could just skip to the truth, Curtis.

343
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,940
Did Mr. Ashford pressure you to lie?

344
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,770
Curtis.

345
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,190
He did. I don't know where
Mr. Ashford was last night,

346
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,120
but I didn't drive him anywhere.

347
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,890
Jon would never hurt the girls.

348
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,440
Mia, tell him.

349
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,850
Well, we'll keep you informed.

350
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,000
Where is she?

351
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,900
Excuse me.

352
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,560
What are you doing in Jon's office?

353
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,940
We still gotta find the girls.

354
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,360
The maid told me that she
saw Wendell coming out here.

355
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,220
Look, pink streaks.

356
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,480
Just like the photo of
the couple by the pool.

357
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,580
I don't think Mr. Ashford
would hurt those girls,

358
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,000
but we still need to get
him to tell us where they are.

359
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,760
If you have any actual evidence,
now would be the time, detective.

360
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,900
Don't worry. I'm on
your schedule, counsel.

361
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,940
Mr. Ashford, is this one of your hotels?

362
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,900
Could be. I have quite a few.

363
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,980
Wendell actually printed that up
from the computer in your home office.

364
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,600
By the way, you should consider
replacing your ink jets there.

365
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,440
You see these streaks?
It's like a signature.

366
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,020
If he needs to tag us in, do
you have a signal or something?

367
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,540
Karadec can handle this guy.

368
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,750
It's not uncommon - yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Of course.

369
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,246
- How's this even relevant?
- You know, none of us could understand

370
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:10,380
why Wendell had this photo on him
until we zoomed in on the woman here.

371
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,030
We noticed one of your hotel bags.

372
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,930
Well done.

373
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,326
You've proven that my client's hotels
provide guests with wonderful swag.

374
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,900
We made some calls, actually.

375
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,800
And it turns out that
gentlemen in the photo

376
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,700
was actually a judge on the
San Mateo county superior court.

377
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,710
And a few years ago,
he allowed you to build

378
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,260
one of your lovely
hotels in a protected area,

379
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,060
despite complaints from environmental
groups that your hotel would

380
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,060
"have devastating impacts on
the sensitive coastal environment."

381
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,440
Are you sleeping okay?

382
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,480
Yeah. I'm just a little tired.

383
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,140
A few months prior, believe it or not,

384
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,000
the same judge was in
the Maldives with his wife

385
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,350
at one of your lovely resorts.

386
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,110
Now, I've never really understood the
difference between a hotel or a resort.

387
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,420
And quite honestly, I don't really care.

388
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,080
But what I do know

389
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,530
is that the judge invited his
entire family to celebrate his 60th.

390
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,670
It's pricey. But I think he
gave you the real gift, didn't he?

391
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,640
I mean, the freedom to
do whatever you wanted

392
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,540
so long as nobody found out.

393
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,820
But Wendell did. And
Wendell had evidence.

394
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,510
And Wendell was going public.

395
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,170
Even if your allegations were true

396
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,270
Mr. Dunn's unavailable to testify.

397
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,100
Sarah is.

398
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,550
You remember Sarah,
Jon? Sarah Keller?

399
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,520
The social worker that you pressured?
The one who called to warn you?

400
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,350
And right after, you texted this number,

401
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,150
"must speak. Urgent."

402
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,710
Now, that text was sent to a prepaid
phone purchased at a gas station.

403
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,710
Who did you text?

404
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,470
- My client has no further comment.
- I bet.

405
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,680
I think your client pays
guys with prepaid phones

406
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,030
to make problems go away.

407
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:57,000
And your son-in-law, Wendell, boy,
boy, he was a problem, wasn't he, Jon?

408
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,000
I would never tell anyone
to hurt the girls' father.

409
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,420
Well, that's a relief.

410
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,606
Anyway, if Ellie and Paige
witnessed the murder of their father,

411
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,010
they can identify who did it.

412
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,320
So, I guess I only have
one question for you.

413
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,670
How long do you think
your prepaid phone guy

414
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,330
is willing to risk leaving
your granddaughters alive?

415
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,580
Please, Mr. Ashford,
tell me how to find him.

416
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,070
His name is Eddie Malone.

417
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,550
We have eyes on the suspect.

418
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
He's going for his pocket,
he could have a weapon.

419
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,016
It's keys. He was just going
for his keys in his pocket.

420
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,180
We're good. We're good.

421
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,910
Let's move.

422
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,710
LAPD!

423
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,780
Turn around. Eddie Malone, you're
under arrest. Reasonable suspicion.

424
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,340
You have the right to remain silent.

425
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,580
Anything you say.

426
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,120
So, Eddie admits that Mr. Ashford
paid him to keep Wendell quiet.

427
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,036
But he insists that when
he got to Wendell's house,

428
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,610
he saw Mia arguing with him and left.

429
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,990
Mia never mentioned she
saw Wendell the day he died.

430
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,796
No, but if she knew
Wendell was going public

431
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,220
with information that would
ruin her father, she had motive.

432
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,760
What? Motive to what?

433
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,620
Kill her ex-husband?

434
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,200
Please tell me you're
not taking this man's word

435
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:47,010
over a mother of two who's
desperate to find her girls.

436
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,630
We need to consider all options.

437
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,670
That's how we get Paige and Ellie home.

438
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,290
Okay. But, this is a guy you call when
you need "things cleaned up," right?

439
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,570
We can't trust him.

440
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,630
You're right. And I can
see him killing Wendell.

441
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,050
But planting rows of
potatoes over his body?

442
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,230
They were tomatoes. Any
why not? I can picture it.

443
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,290
The fresh tire track at Wendell's house
turned out to be a match for Mia's car.

444
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,000
- Since when?
- We got a text from oz about an hour ago.

445
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,760
But Mia wasn't a suspect at the time, so

446
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,620
what? And she is now?

447
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,520
Come on, you guys, what
use your imaginations.

448
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,630
She could've swung by to grab
some rutabagas or the girls' homework.

449
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,360
Or, you know, they're trying to
iron out the details of a nasty divorce.

450
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,150
No - get this.

451
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:34,360
Mia ashford withdrew a hundred
grand just before the bank's close today.

452
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,136
I had a unit swing by her parents'
house, but they don't know where she is.

453
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,370
Okay, why don't we just call the
woman and ask her to explain herself?

454
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,580
- She's in your phone?
- Well, yeah. She was upset. We talked.

455
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,790
Exchanged numbers.

456
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,760
<i>This is Mia. Please leave a message.</i>

457
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,730
Okay. Listen to me.
Are you seriously saying

458
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,490
that you think Mia killed her
ex-husband and kidnapped her own kids?

459
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,520
I'm saying we can't rule it out.

460
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,150
- Parental abductions happen.
- Yeah, they sure do.

461
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,166
And if the girls are with their mother,
at least we know they're not in danger.

462
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,810
That's great. That's great.

463
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,670
So, the one thing that we do agree on

464
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,670
is that the woman is not planning
on murdering her own two children.

465
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,850
That's so great.

466
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,750
It feels so great to be on the same page.

467
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,696
She might be keeping the girls quiet
if they witnessed Mia kill their father.

468
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,480
- My god.
- Look, look, it's late.

469
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,200
There's nothing more we can do tonight.

470
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,520
I want you all to go home and get
some rest but leave your phones on.

471
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,210
Should another lead come
up, we're right back here.

472
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,390
In the meantime, our friend
Eddie spends the night.

473
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:30,110
And, Daphne, move Mia's photo over
to the suspects side of the case board.

474
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,250
- My god.
- We need to find her.

475
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,630
Until she gives us answers,
we consider her a suspect.

476
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,530
You cannot be serious.

477
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,430
This is so stupid.

478
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,886
Morgan, no one is saying you're wrong,
but you have to understand that the

479
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,740
I understand this woman!

480
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,780
She's terrified.

481
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,750
She doesn't know where her kids are.

482
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,410
And I promised her
that she could trust us.

483
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,040
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

484
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,056
The lab is still testing the Van
for evidence. Maybe they'll find

485
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,160
you and I both know they're
not gonna find anything.

486
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,770
That's what Eddie does,
he cleans up, remember?

487
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,740
Do I need to explain to you
how enzyme-based cleaners

488
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,200
break down the proteins in blood?

489
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,020
You heard soto, right, Morgan?

490
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,680
She said we all need to go
get some rest, especially you.

491
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,130
Yeah, gosh. Everyone's
got such great advice.

492
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,130
Let me tell you something,
I didn't rest for the 27 hours

493
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,526
leading up to finding out that
two little girls were kidnapped.

494
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,140
Wait, what? Are you serious,

495
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,146
so, I'm not sure what
you think is gonna happen

496
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,040
when I lay my head
down on my pillow tonight,

497
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,986
knowing that Ellie and
Paige are still out there.

498
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,660
You think I'm gonna just drift
right off to sweet slumberland?

499
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,150
Maybe recharge my batteries?

500
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,740
I can guarantee you,
there'll be no resting.

501
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,770
You told Mia she could trust us.

502
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,300
But, maybe, just
maybe, we can't trust her.

503
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,330
Either way, you and I are on
the same team here, Morgan.

504
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:03,890
It has now been over 24 hours since
the ashford sisters were last seen.

505
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,960
- Hey, mama.
- Hi.

506
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,830
- Thanks for staying late.
- Yeah.

507
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,280
How's everybody here?

508
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,450
We're doing great.

509
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,380
We got some leftover pizza for ya.

510
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,606
I'm gonna put this little
lady down before I head out.

511
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,630
Good night.

512
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,506
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
No, don't throw that away.

513
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,120
You save that for the compost.

514
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,640
What compost?

515
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,400
The compost we're getting
tomorrow. We're getting a compost.

516
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,586
What am I supposed
to do with this until then?

517
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,650
Just, like, hang on to it?

518
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,950
Yeah, hang on to it. Come here first.

519
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,650
- Mom?
- Yeah.

520
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,310
You okay?

521
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,210
Yes. I'm better now.

522
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,910
- I've seen enough.
- I love you.

523
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,050
Love you too.

524
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,730
Have you been on that thing all day?

525
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,470
I'm watching an eight-part
docuseries on crispr technology.

526
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,920
Well, that's a lot of parts.

527
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,970
Why don't you do four
tonight and four tomorrow?

528
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,470
But I am already on part seven.

529
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,720
All right. Move it away
from your face a little bit.

530
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,486
And when you're done, I want an
essay on both the science and the ethics.

531
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,550
- Okay.
- Okay?

532
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,030
- Love you, buddy.
- Night.

533
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,240
You know how to clear a room.

534
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,590
Everything okay?

535
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,520
There's just things that we
care about that we shouldn't

536
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,600
and things that we don't
care about that we should.

537
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,396
And we really oughta
figure out which is which,

538
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,940
because I would love to have a
world for my kids to grow up in.

539
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,400
Cold or microwaved?

540
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,600
I don't know.

541
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,900
I'm sorry. No more questions.

542
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,406
I'm sure you have enough
in your head already.

543
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,470
I'm so... I'm sorry.

544
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,090
It's not you. You're great. I just

545
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,966
my brain just wouldn't work
today and I really needed it to.

546
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,930
Hey, you with half a brain beats
the rest of us on our best day.

547
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,760
Those little girls deserve
to have it be my best day.

548
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:52,420
The girls were last seen yesterday
afternoon around 3:00 P.M.,

549
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,450
<i>where neighbors
reported seeing the girls</i>

550
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,490
there was nothing in the spotlight.

551
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,250
Someone moved that Buddha. Why?

552
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:02,050
They moved the Buddha 'cause
they wanted to open the cabinets.

553
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,740
But nothing looked like it was missing.

554
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,600
Nothing was missing, so
something was switched.

555
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,120
Do you see?

556
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,050
Something was switched.

557
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,750
Pizza to go, then.

558
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,860
- We're closed.
- Don't look like it.

559
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,690
How did you know I'd be here?

560
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,620
Well, Google tells me that this
guy is an expert in Chinese antiques,

561
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,420
and your mom loves China.

562
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,326
Honestly, I think your family is
hogging all the books on the subject.

563
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,630
So tell me, am I correct that the
ming in your parents' house is a fake?

564
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,910
Because it had a little boy
playing Colin-maillard on it.

565
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,306
And that wouldn't exactly be
historically accurate, would it?

566
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,066
- Well...
- no, it's not because Colin-maillard

567
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,410
became a hit in the 16th century.

568
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,640
So little boys wouldn't
be playing it in the ming.

569
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,610
You know what? It doesn't matter.

570
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,076
That's not the point. The point is the
ming at your parents' house is not real

571
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,650
because you put a fake in
there to replace the real one,

572
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,620
which is right here.

573
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,520
Right?

574
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,320
So tell me, Mia, why do
you need so much cash?

575
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,350
None of your business.

576
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,700
Could you give us the room, please?

577
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,780
The police should be out
there finding you daughters,

578
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,710
not running all over town looking for you.

579
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,926
I can't speak to the police!

580
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,510
Well, great! I'm not the police.

581
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,696
A man called me saying
that he had Paige and Ellie,

582
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,820
and if I don't give him
200 grand by tonight

583
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,410
that they'll end up like Wendell.

584
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:35,140
I could only withdraw
half from the bank, so

585
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,760
Mia, we have to call
the police. This is not

586
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,760
no, no, no. If I call the police,
he'll kill them. That's what he said.

587
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,900
Please.

588
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,156
That's why I couldn't go to
my parents for the money.

589
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,560
Because I knew they
would start making calls.

590
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,810
Why didn't you tell me you
saw Wendell before he died?

591
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,400
I couldn't tell anyone.

592
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,570
Not without sending my father to jail.

593
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:00,410
I only went to Wendell's to
beg him not to report my father,

594
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,550
but he wouldn't listen, so I went home.

595
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,340
Look, my father is a flawed man,

596
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,650
but he's always been
there for me and the girls.

597
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,830
I'm sorry.

598
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,240
When is the meet?

599
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,310
Tonight at midnight.

600
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,660
He's texted a location.

601
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:20,560
Please believe me. I have no
idea who kidnapped my daughters.

602
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,190
I'm going with you.

603
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,020
Are you sure that's a good idea?

604
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,570
No, I have no idea.

605
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,090
What I do know is that I'm
not gonna let you do this alone.

606
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,340
I know you're scared.

607
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,340
We got this.

608
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,356
Mia, step out of the car, please.
Keep your hands where I can see them.

609
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,000
- Please. My girls.
- Thank you.

610
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,806
Wait, wait, wait. Hang on,
hang on. Let me explain.

611
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,846
We're gonna go down to the
station, handle this the right way.

612
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,270
Stop. You need to trust each other.

613
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,470
- You called the cops?
- No, I didn't. I called him.

614
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,740
- Why?
- Because

615
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,120
if these were my kids,
I would want him here.

616
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,476
- She needs to take that.
- No, she doesn't.

617
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,060
Karadec, this is a ransom.

618
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,230
If I don't pay this guy,
my girls will die. Please.

619
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,440
Speakerphone.

620
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,650
- Hello?
- - I hope you're alone.

621
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,340
- I am.
- And you brought the money?

622
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,170
Yes. Now where are my daughters?

623
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,730
<i>I'll text you the location.</i>

624
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,970
<i>- Be there in five minutes or they die.
- - Okay.</i>

625
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,250
- I have to go.
- No, you don't.

626
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,466
As long as you don't give the man
what he wants, your girls are safe.

627
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,690
- He said five minutes!
- It's too soon. I need backup.

628
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,020
Karadec, they'd never
make it here in time.

629
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,710
Please.

630
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,060
Morgan, give her your phone.

631
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,610
What is he doing?

632
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,480
Answer it.

633
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,270
Okay. Keep that in your
pocket so I can hear everything.

634
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,100
- If anything happens, I'll step in.
- Okay.

635
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
Let's go.

636
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,070
Morgan, stay here.

637
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,360
Yes.

638
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,120
<i>Keep walking.</i>

639
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,090
Okay.

640
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,680
<i>Go to the auditorium.</i>

641
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,930
- Where are you?
- See the door on your right?

642
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,070
Yes.

643
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,620
<i>Go inside.</i>

644
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,090
Now what?

645
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,810
<i>Hook the bag.</i>

646
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,230
Let me talk to my girls first.

647
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,890
<i>Do exactly as I tell you, and
everything will be all right.</i>

648
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,530
Where are they?

649
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,430
Are they with you?

650
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,050
Paige!

651
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,920
Ellie, where are you?

652
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,610
Stop! LAPD!

653
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,240
Stop! LAPD!

654
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,840
Damn it.

655
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,500
- What's going on?
- He's gone!

656
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,260
- They're gone!
- What?

657
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,020
I put a car tracker in the money bag.

658
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,160
Come on.

659
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:59,990
Turn right here!

660
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:05,170
- No.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

661
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,140
Ellie. Paige. My girls! Open the trunk!

662
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,930
My god! My god!

663
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,140
Wait! Wait!

664
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,490
My god!

665
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,210
My god!

666
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,770
Open it!

667
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,840
It's okay! It's okay.

668
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,700
They're not in there.

669
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,880
It's okay.

670
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,030
- It's not her fault.
- No?

671
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,350
It was my call.

672
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,630
Who are you, you short son of a bitch?

673
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,160
Come on.

674
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,300
Think.

675
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,380
<i>Made a $500 bet on both
teams that were trailing by 21</i>

676
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,900
<i>boston's favored by four points - my god.</i>

677
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,700
I know who took the girls.

678
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,956
When I first saw him
parked outside, I was like,

679
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,500
"why would he park under that
tree? It doesn't make any sense."

680
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:43,206
<i>The birds and the leaves. Cleanup
of the car would be a nightmare.</i>

681
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:46,130
And then I realized he's
parked there because he can see

682
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,620
<i>inside Mia's bedroom
window from the mirror.</i>

683
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,580
<i>Curtis is in love with Mia.</i>

684
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,360
Now when he couldn't
win big at gambling,

685
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,480
he figured, why not give
the ransom game a try?

686
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,836
Because he was gonna need money

687
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,700
if he wanted to sweep
an ashford off her feet.

688
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,660
<i>So he planned to kidnap the girls
to get the money to win her hand.</i>

689
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,436
And was the knight in shining armor
for Mia during the most traumatic day

690
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,560
of her life to win her heart. But how?

691
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,980
We were so focused on Jon's fake alibi,

692
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,500
<i>but it was really Curtis
who was hiding behind it.</i>

693
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,896
<i>He must've showed up to
Wendell's in the middle of dinner,</i>

694
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,786
<i>got into a fight in the
greenhouse, where he killed him,</i>

695
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:17,780
<i>buried the body, then came
back inside to take the girls.</i>

696
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,720
Wendell didn't deserve Mia.

697
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,790
The horrible farm that
he forced her to live on,

698
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:28,790
and then the custody dispute,
and now her father's in prison? I.

699
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,350
I couldn't let him hurt my family.

700
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,870
So you loved Mia?

701
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,126
That's why you killed Wendell. And
that's why you kidnapped Mia's girls.

702
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,670
No. I was gonna bring the girls back.

703
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,600
And play the hero?
Was that your big plan?

704
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,126
You wanted to stage a dramatic rescue?

705
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,670
- Tell me where they are!
- I don't know where they are!

706
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:47,430
All right. Curtis, listen to me.

707
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,640
It's not too late for
you to do the right thing.

708
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,020
Just tell me where you
took Ellie and Paige.

709
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,340
If they're really family to you,
then let's bring them home safe.

710
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,480
He took them to the
San Gabriel mountains.

711
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,170
He said they ran off this
morning, and he couldn't find them.

712
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,660
San Gabriels are huge.

713
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,830
970 square miles

714
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,630
with a range and elevation
spanning 8,500 feet,

715
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,280
and they've been out there for hours.

716
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,460
Call search and rescue. I want
aerial support and ems on site.

717
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Got it.

718
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,090
- Paige!
- Ellie!

719
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,880
- Ellie!
- Paige!

720
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,300
- When lost, go north.
- How would the girls know that?

721
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,796
The book says you have three options.

722
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,580
Moss, sun or migratory birds.

723
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,030
- Moss?
- Paige! Can you hear us?

724
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,200
- Paige!
- Ellie!

725
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,830
- Ellie!
- Paige!

726
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:38,970
Ellie!

727
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,830
- Ellie!
- We're here to help!

728
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,460
- Paige!
- Call out if you can hear us!

729
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,010
Walnut shells.

730
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,120
Feed off forest resources.

731
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,670
Ellie!

732
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,750
Paige!

733
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,790
- Paige!
- - Girls, can you hear us?

734
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,240
Rule number three:

735
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,580
Indicate your presence
with a recognizable sign.

736
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,410
Over here! This way!

737
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,730
Ellie!

738
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,210
And take shelter while you wait for help.

739
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,140
Well

740
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,970
well

741
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,070
today was a good day.

742
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,180
It was a good day, wasn't it?

743
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,630
I owe you something,
Morgan. A thank-you.

744
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,390
For trusting me.

745
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,530
Did I do that?

746
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,576
When you texted me to come
help you guys with the kidnapper.

747
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,990
Yeah. I mean, you gave
me enough time to get there.

748
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,966
Didn't give me enough time
to call for backup though,

749
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,176
which, once I realized the
career-ending debacle you threw me into

750
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,890
were you thanking me? Is that
how this whole rant started, or

751
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,030
yeah.

752
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,790
Well, I would like to thank you

753
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:53,520
for not going full
Rambo: First blood part ii

754
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:56,140
like I know you wanted to.

755
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,660
Yeah.

756
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,590
You think this will ever happen again?

757
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,010
- Us trusting each other.
- I don't. I don't.

758
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,550
It was good while it lasted though.

759
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:06,770
It was fine.

760
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,020
Gillory.

761
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,640
Come here.

762
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,020
Are we hugging?

763
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,190
- Absolutely not.
- Okay. Well, take it easy.

764
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:19,470
You don't have to say it like that.

765
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,850
My badge?

766
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,300
What.

767
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,030
I must have lost it.

768
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,200
You lost it. And I found it in the woods.

769
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,170
Get some rest, detective.

770
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,830
You too, consultant.
