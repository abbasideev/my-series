1
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,470
Official LAPD business. Keep
my baby close. This won't take long.

2
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,130
Detectives.

3
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,100
- Where's my better half?
- Bathroom.

4
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,350
Good morning, Morgan.

5
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,250
So, what do you think happened?

6
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,770
Well, I think we can rule out nothing.

7
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,266
And we're off.

8
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,856
Melted candles, empty glass,
clothes thrown everywhere.

9
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,756
It looks like a wild night that went south.

10
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,616
But was it murder?

11
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,376
A hundred percent.
What, you don't think so?

12
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,176
I think it was murder and a cover-up,

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,400
but I wanna know how you know.

14
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,820
Sounds like a challenge.

15
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,456
How fun. See these hand towels?

16
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,876
You may remember that I
used to be a professional cleaner.

17
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,900
- Vaguely, yeah.
- Yes.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,536
The way that these towels
are folded are a disgrace.

19
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,256
Look, the bottom two have two edges,

20
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,630
the top one has three edges.

21
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,166
That means the killer used this
top towel to clean up after himself,

22
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,700
cover his tracks.

23
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,850
Now, get down here
and see what I'm seeing.

24
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,190
I can see just fine from up here,
thanks. But what do you see?

25
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,710
You see these streaks?

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,626
Any self-respecting housekeeper is gonna
use a microfiber mop on a bathroom floor.

27
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,820
Our murderer used that
towel to wipe up this area.

28
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,240
Which suggests a cover-up.

29
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,216
Exactly. Now, our Vic... Is it okay
if I call him Vic? It's happening.

30
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,450
Our Vic was not alone,

31
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,226
because no man's gonna spend
money on a hotel room this fancy

32
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,916
unless he's planning on entertaining.

33
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,910
A sexy brunette.

34
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,406
Why? Did you find a hair sample?

35
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,476
Nah, but blonde seems too obvious,
so I'm going with brunette for now.

36
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,236
Either way, she had to be
pretty attractive because

37
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,486
I don't mean to be disrespectful,

38
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,826
but the dead guy in the tub is super hot.

39
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,750
Morgan, please don't ever comment
on the hotness of a victim ever again.

40
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,456
Okay. The manager opened the safe
for us, and we found the victim's wallet.

41
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,860
$80 cash and an ID.

42
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,426
Ernest lozano, Mexico City.

43
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,596
Do a deep dive.

44
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,636
Anything, everything
you can find on the guy.

45
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,326
Stop by the security center
downstairs. Look at last night's footage.

46
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,350
- Got it.
- Yep.

47
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,786
- Wonder what he was drugged with.
- How do you know he was drugged?

48
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,220
Well, 'cause who does their dishes
in a hotel room? Except you, maybe.

49
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,786
Anyway, this glass was
rinsed out and wiped clean.

50
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,616
Why do that unless you were
trying to get rid of white residue?

51
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,346
- Notice anything else about the glass?
- That's a whiskey tumbler.

52
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,796
Lead-free, crystal-cut, which is
harder and more durable than glass.

53
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,240
Withstands most scratches.
Also refracts light beautifully.

54
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,930
You want me to know
you drink whiskey so bad.

55
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,356
Point being this piece of glassware

56
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,930
is far more expensive than the others.

57
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,920
It must have been
brought up to the room.

58
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,296
Lozano and his sexy brunette stopped
at the hotel bar before coming to the room.

59
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,916
But you already knew that.

60
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,816
The tumbler was rinsed out,
leaving little to zero trace of whiskey,

61
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,716
which strongly suggests a cover-up.

62
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,230
And why cover it up unless it was
murder? Now, let's go hit the hotel bar.

63
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,400
I recognize him.

64
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,346
He had a drink at the start
of my shift around 7:00 P.M.

65
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,370
Was he with anyone?

66
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,726
A sexy brunette, maybe?

67
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,866
I'd say medium sexy.

68
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,860
- Also, she was a blonde.
- Really?

69
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,016
- Did it seem like business or pleasure?
- Maybe both.

70
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,760
The guy was definitely tying one on.

71
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,326
Made sure to leave a generous
tip before they bounced.

72
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,776
Catch the name of his
guest by any chance?

73
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,250
We were slammed, so I
couldn't really hear their convo.

74
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,600
But I wanna say that her name
sounded like, Candice or Gladys or Janice.

75
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,516
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

76
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,300
So, we scrubbed through last night's
footage, and we found this at 8:02 P.M.

77
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,346
Lozano and his mystery woman
got on the fourth floor, into the room.

78
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,790
And then at 8:33 P.M.,
right there, she leaves.

79
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,976
No one else used a key card to
enter the suite until this morning

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
when the cleaners discovered
Ernest lozano's body.

81
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,736
That must be our killer.

82
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,056
I showed a photo of our mystery
woman to the hotel doorman.

83
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,916
He said she parked her red kia out
front in a no-parking zone around 7:00 P.M.

84
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,716
Shortly after, la dot arrived
and started writing tickets.

85
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,716
So call la dot, see if
we can ID the red car.

86
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,810
I already called.

87
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,306
They didn't issue a ticket to a red
kia out front of this hotel last night.

88
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,170
Well, the only cars that don't get
ticketed belong to cops and doctors.

89
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,580
- Cops aren't issued red cars.
- Right. So it must be vehicle code 21058.

90
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,860
Yeah, it must be. Yeah. Remind
oz about vehicle code 21058.

91
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,326
It's an emblem allowing physicians
responding to emergencies

92
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,736
to be exempt from
laws governing parking.

93
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,466
There's a hospital less
than a mile from here.

94
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,436
Swing by, see if anyone recognizes the
woman from our hotel security footage,

95
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,980
and we'll circle back at the precinct.

96
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,840
That sounds like a city council
issue, not a major crimes issue.

97
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,050
Of course. Keep me posted. Bye.

98
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,446
How's the hotel case lookin'?

99
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,586
Daphne and oz ID'd our suspect as a
physician who works in the neighborhood.

100
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,416
They're bringing her in for
questioning as we speak.

101
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,930
- You like her for it?
- Very much.

102
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,356
We have her on hotel security footage
entering and exiting the victim's room

103
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,766
- around the time of the murder.
- Yes.

104
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,116
It's open-and-shut.

105
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,140
- The file you requested, lieutenant.
- Thank you.

106
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,606
You good with that? Need some help?

107
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,430
No one can help me with this.

108
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,956
I'm gonna have to rely on
someone I'd rather not deal with.

109
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,950
Welcome to my world.

110
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:16,540
Dr. Iris bowman, tell us about
your relationship with Ernest lozano.

111
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,100
I wouldn't call it a relationship.

112
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,626
What would you call it?

113
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,836
Harmless fun.

114
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,976
We met three months ago
in a hotel bar and hit it off.

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,550
I... I can't believe he's dead.

116
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,806
When you say "hit it off"

117
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,420
it's exactly what you think it means.

118
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,986
Ernest would reach out
whenever he was in town.

119
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:38,390
It was no-strings-attached
fun between two adults.

120
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,506
Well, what did you know about him?

121
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,910
Ernest was a curator in Mexico City.

122
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,926
He wasn't like most la guys.
He was fun, charming, cultured.

123
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,090
What's your husband
think about this casual fling?

124
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,750
My husband died in a car
accident nine months ago.

125
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,006
What Ernest and I had was temporary.

126
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,930
He was meant to be
a... a band-aid on my life.

127
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,710
So what happened last night?

128
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,590
Nothing. He was in
town, I met him at our spot.

129
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,196
We had a drink or two, went
up to our room, drew a bath.

130
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,600
But then Ernest fell asleep, so I left.

131
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,126
Well, see, the thing is, Dr. Bowman,

132
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,670
we have you on security
footage entering lozano's room

133
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,780
and then exiting 30 minutes later.

134
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:27,440
After that, not a soul enters or exits
that room, and now Ernest lozano is dead.

135
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,696
I told you everything.

136
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,526
He was alive when I left.

137
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,620
- Do I need a lawyer?
- That would be wise.

138
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,086
You have the right to remain silent

139
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,706
- and refuse to answer questions...
- she didn't do it.

140
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,946
The candles. There were
candles lining the bathtub.

141
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,916
I have the same ones at
home. I got 'em on clearance.

142
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,460
They smell like laundry. But the problem
is they only burn for about four hours.

143
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,980
I'm sorry, I-I don't know.
Is that, a long time?

144
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,230
For a candle? What? No.
A tea light burns longer. No.

145
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,200
All of the candles were melted
down all the way except for this one.

146
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,680
Something put out this candle,
and you know what puts out fire?

147
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,510
Water.

148
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,246
- Yes, doctor. Water.
- Water. Water.

149
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,766
- Water puts out fire.
- In this case, bathwater.

150
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,930
Bathwater put out this lone candle.

151
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,806
So that means there was a tub fight.

152
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,830
There was thrashing around, bathwater
splashed out and extinguished the flame.

153
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,730
<i>The candle looked
like it had been burning</i>

154
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,776
<i>for about an hour and a half.</i>

155
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,220
Okay. So you are saying that
when Dr. Bowman left the room,

156
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,196
all the candles were
burning, and an hour after that,

157
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,266
something happened in that room.

158
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,090
And someone was in that room.

159
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,550
Can I leave now?

160
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,030
Yeah. Free to go.

161
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,770
Speaking of good?

162
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,740
And our only suspect walks out the door.

163
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,120
Mahomes, under on passing
yards, over on rushing yards.

164
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,160
Next, wnba finals.
Aces, money line, Wilson.

165
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,036
Fifteen years ago, Roman
sinquerra painted a mural downtown.

166
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,720
You wrote the citation and
the report, but both are illegible.

167
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,830
What does this say?

168
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,970
Look, if you're so interested, give me 2k.

169
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,636
Fine, 1k. No? 500?

170
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,336
I don't care how low you go. I'm
not gonna pay you for information.

171
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Yeah.

172
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,096
Whatever thing is happening in
Nascar, 1,000 on numbers ten through 19.

173
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,120
And that's it. I love you, mom. Bye.

174
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,090
Read this address out loud now.

175
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,130
"14641 willing ton street."

176
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,580
No such place.

177
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,216
There's a Washington
boulevard and a billing ton street,

178
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,350
but neither has a 14641.

179
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, this is definitely
14641 billing ton street.

180
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,350
Again, no such place.

181
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,280
- Fifty bucks says there is.
- There isn't.

182
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,600
But if you wanna give me your
money like that, sure, I'll check it out.

183
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,220
I'll drive.

184
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,890
Wow.

185
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,206
There used to be nothing but chop
shops and stash houses on this street.

186
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,866
Now they got a cross fit gym,

187
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,316
vegan Nashville hot chicken
restaurant and a third-wave coffee shop.

188
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,380
It's beautiful.

189
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,900
Wait. This was the street, right?

190
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,660
I could have sworn the mural was here.

191
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,040
Maybe I didn't write this.

192
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,250
Turn around, melon.

193
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,330
14614 billing ton.

194
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,926
Looks like a sign protected
a part of that mural.

195
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,926
It's a cool fish tail.

196
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,710
That's a bird's wing. Those
are feathers, not scales.

197
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,826
- That's a fish tail.
- It's a bird's wing.

198
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,990
Double or nothing.

199
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,000
Why not?

200
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,760
Definitely feathers.

201
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,830
- We have news on our victim.
- What's up?

202
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,730
We heard back from Ernest
lozano's colleagues in Mexico City.

203
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,126
They say he's alive and well
and showing up at work every day.

204
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,430
- What...
- Yeah.

205
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,436
Local police questioned
lozano about his ID showing up

206
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,436
at the hotel of a murdered man.

207
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,120
He told them about a ride he
took a couple years ago in la.

208
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,926
On the drive, he and the driver joked
about how much they looked alike.

209
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,446
Later that night, he realized
he lost his wallet. So our victim...

210
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,230
- Is not Ernest lozano. Okay.
- Yeah.

211
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,936
Put pressure on the lab for DNA
and fingerprints from the crime scene,

212
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,936
and I'll look more closely at...

213
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,030
Where's the evidence box?

214
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,210
"Working from home. See you
tomorrow. Morgan." Smiley face.

215
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,780
This is the best movie night ever.

216
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,060
All right. The trick is to see if we
can notice things other people can't.

217
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,246
What do you think these keys go to?

218
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,440
Bike lock, po box and car keys.

219
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,486
You are my son.

220
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,006
Ava, can you grab us a couple of sodas?

221
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,170
I can't touch surfaces
'cause of my gloves.

222
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,146
Okay. This is interesting.

223
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,806
Do you see this stitching right here?

224
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,550
- Thank you. This is from...
- two sodas

225
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,086
hi, strange boy in my
house. Who are you?

226
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,770
I'm Ryder, Ava's friend.

227
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,330
Yeah?

228
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,856
What are you doing?

229
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,276
What does it look like? Studying.

230
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,176
I couldn't find the cookies,
so I got cheese puffs.

231
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,416
Thank you. I love cheese puffs

232
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,400
I bought those. These are mine. Can
I see you in the hallway for a second?

233
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,140
Okay. Don't freak out.

234
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,016
Ludo said I could have Ryder in my room

235
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,200
as long as we shut the
door if our music got too loud.

236
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,266
He did? Man, what a problem-solver.

237
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,576
That's great, because,

238
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,980
my primary concern here was
the decibel level of your music.

239
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,546
No. Mom, we were just studying.

240
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,820
To be continued.

241
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,556
I assume you got my post-it.

242
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,410
You never take evidence
home, Morgan. Ever. Y

243
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,900
you have got to be kidding me.

244
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,870
What? He's wearing gloves.

245
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,226
You're upset, and you're
allowed to have all your feelings.

246
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,320
But people bring their
work home all the time.

247
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,870
My daughter is in her room
working on her homework right now.

248
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,500
Elliot, go bug your sister. Quick.
Run. Open... keep the door open.

249
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,920
Ava, I'm coming to bug you!

250
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,510
Morgan, this goes against all rules
and all protocol for handling evidence.

251
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,976
Well, what's the worst
that could happen?

252
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,380
You know, I don't know. Let me think.

253
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,380
Right. Everything in here
becomes inadmissible in court,

254
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,850
and we can't convict the murderer.

255
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,156
Yeah, that's bad. That'd
be bad. And I get that.

256
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,846
I did think about that.
But here's the thing,

257
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,986
I really want to help you
figure out who your dead guy is.

258
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,390
Silly me. I was gonna use
dental records and fingerprints.

259
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,530
There's so many clues in this
evidence box that you guys missed.

260
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,996
Did anybody even look at the shoes?

261
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,610
There's cement all over the soles.

262
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,276
He must have lived or
worked near a construction site.

263
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,540
Great. We'll just visit the one
construction site in Los Angeles.

264
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,200
Okay. Look at the man's pants.

265
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,100
This is not the original stitching,

266
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,930
but this repair was
done by a professional.

267
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,046
- See the-the threads?
- What about them?

268
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,286
They don't cross.

269
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,466
You don't find that the tiniest bit strange?

270
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,636
I can say with full confidence
I have never in my life

271
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,336
thought about how threads
cross on a pants hem.

272
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,250
Well, lucky for you, I've spent
a lot of time thinking about it.

273
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,956
The whole hyperactive brain
thing makes it hard to fall asleep.

274
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,430
So, for a long time, the only
thing that would put me down

275
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,376
<i>was watching sewing
and alterations videos.</i>

276
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,230
Now, the victim's pants were
repaired without crossing.

277
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,556
That is something that is
unique to tailors from Madagascar.

278
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,146
Because they have a superstition
that crossing your stitches is unlucky.

279
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,480
You know what? Just make a list

280
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,596
of all of the tailors from
Madagascar in the area.

281
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,596
I don't think the LAPD
has a magical database

282
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,156
of seamstresses and tailors
cross-referenced by ethnicity.

283
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,260
But, you know, I can check.

284
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,916
Well, all you need to do is find all of
the tailor and alteration shops in la,

285
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,336
and find the ones
with the longest names.

286
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,500
Because long names are
uniquely mad a gas can?

287
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,066
Well, no, but their naming customs
are unlike anywhere else in the world.

288
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,090
<i>All of their names are unique,
and every name has meaning.</i>

289
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,480
<i>And when two people get married,</i>

290
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,456
<i>they just smash their names
together into one big, giant, long name.</i>

291
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,680
<i>It's super romantic.</i>

292
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,696
Okay. So, compile a list
of tailors in Los Angeles,

293
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,186
find the ones with the longest names,

294
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,010
and then look for one
by a construction site.

295
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,450
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

296
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,280
Yeah. Okay. Well, we'll
get into that tomorrow.

297
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,700
- Okay.
- And, Morgan,

298
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,940
don't ever use that phrase again.

299
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,296
Probably will.

300
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,050
So, Ryder seems nice.

301
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,570
Funny. That's what his po said.

302
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,230
Parole officer. Yeah, I get
it. 'Cause he was in juvie.

303
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,300
Chino. He was tried as an adult.

304
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,690
You... you are so, so funny.

305
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,240
But seriously, tell me all
about him. I wanna know.

306
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,736
- Hey, I gotta go or I'll be late.
- Sit.

307
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,396
Put your phone away. I guess
we're doing this the hard way.

308
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,660
Did you mean for that to rhyme?

309
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,490
I will be asking the questions. Okay?

310
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,840
- Tell me about Ryder.
- All we were doing was studying.

311
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,746
It always starts with studying,

312
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,576
and then you're lying
about where you were.

313
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,800
And the next thing you know

314
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,290
you're a single mom, with
three kids, pretending to be a cop.

315
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,416
I am not pretending. Thank
you very much. I am consulting.

316
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,076
Yeah. I know. You
don't even have a badge.

317
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,170
You think I need a badge? Okay.

318
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,760
I will have you know, I walk into a space

319
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,256
and people are like, "who is this?" Okay?

320
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,360
Then other people are like,

321
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,676
"I don't know, but she
definitely belongs here."

322
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,390
Okay, mom, this is cringe. I gotta go.

323
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,180
"Make way," they all yell. You know?

324
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,010
"Give that lady access."

325
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,400
When can I get a badge?

326
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,130
Please, stop ringing the bell. Okay?

327
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,350
How old were you
when you started dating?

328
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,106
I bet you were that guy
who dated the same girl

329
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,370
all four years of high school.

330
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,680
And then on prom night,
you made a pact to lose your

331
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:25,116
hello. Are you raissa rakota harimalala?

332
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,140
Indeed. You may call me rai.

333
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,126
Rai. Real quick, do
you recognize this man?

334
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,150
Mr. Eduardo.

335
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,460
- Is... is he dead?
- Eduardo is his last name?

336
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,126
No.

337
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,236
Eduardo's his first name.

338
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,306
Yes.

339
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,406
Do you know his last name?

340
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,476
No. Mr. Eduardo, he
always pays in cash.

341
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,900
Can you tell us anything about him?

342
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,780
Mr. Eduardo is one of my regulars.

343
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,346
He finds designer suits secondhand.

344
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,240
I make them look nice again.

345
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,760
- Get excited. We got a first name.
- I'm thrilled.

346
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,746
You do realize there could be thousands
of eduardos in Los Angeles though, right?

347
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:05,250
Wait. Do you hear that?

348
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,630
Sweet, sweet sounds of the city.

349
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,616
Okay. Tailor shop,
construction site. Now what?

350
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,810
Now we just got to find a parking lot.

351
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,330
Yep. Right here.

352
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,780
Why do we care about parking?

353
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,160
Don't get mad at me.

354
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,176
Of course you brought his keys.

355
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,626
Well, it's still in the evidence bag,

356
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,170
and it's a good thing I did. Because...

357
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,560
Eduardo's Toyota.

358
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,630
Next time.

359
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,120
- Forester.
- What do you need?

360
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,786
Hey, daph. I just sent you the plates
on our victim's vehicle. Do your thing.

361
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,136
Probably the car Ernest
lozano lost his wallet in.

362
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,880
And I will have to call you back. Bye.

363
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,880
Morgan. Morgan. No. No, no. Don't.

364
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,206
Gloves. Sorry. Gloves.

365
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,896
No, it's not the gloves.
Actually, yes, you do need gloves.

366
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,556
But before you touch
anything, just ask me first. Okay?

367
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,906
No, you're totally right. I apologize.

368
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,650
You said that before.
Won't happen again.

369
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,650
Except I did already touch everything.

370
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,240
He's got suits, charging
cables, little waters, hand

371
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,666
the guy's a rideshare driver.

372
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,256
Yes. How'd you do that so fast?

373
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,220
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

374
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,150
Yep. Yeah, that too.

375
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,306
Daphne says the car is
registered to an Eduardo Cortez,

376
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,330
lives in this building.

377
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,176
Ten years ago, the guy did
time in prison for credit card fraud.

378
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,890
Since then, he's been a rideshare driver.

379
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,316
Pretty fancy building for a
driver. We sure this is our guy?

380
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,836
Eduardo Cortez's driver's license.

381
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,596
Yeah, that's him.

382
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,690
How do you have a hot
driver's license photo?

383
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,180
216, this should be the place.

384
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,730
- Morgan, what did I tell you ab...
- I'm just kidding.

385
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,460
You're fun.

386
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,460
You're a lot of fun.

387
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,470
Daddy! Daddy's home!

388
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,190
Hello? Can I help you?

389
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,470
Sorry to intrude, ma'am. I'm
LAPD detective Adam karadec.

390
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,300
This is consultant Morgan gillery.

391
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,966
Do you happen to know
an Eduardo Cortez?

392
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,240
He's my husband.

393
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,720
Is he okay?

394
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,490
Cheers. Ooh!

395
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,296
I'll let mine cool down. It's just too hot.

396
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,506
Gosh. Thank you, guys,
for sharing your tea with me.

397
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,886
Your friends are all really nice.

398
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,460
Do you have a favorite friend?

399
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,220
I won't tell the rest.

400
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,856
Stanley. He can take photos too.

401
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,570
Stanley can take photos?
No way. Let me see this.

402
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,680
So cool.

403
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,416
My daddy gave him to me.
He also gave me that dictionary.

404
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,590
Words are... words are important.

405
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,496
We've been together for ten years.

406
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,876
I met Eduardo after he
was released from prison.

407
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,060
How long had he been driving?

408
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,326
He used to drive up until three years ago,

409
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,366
when he started at his cousin's
wine distribution business.

410
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,190
Was it strange that
he hadn't come home?

411
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,506
His job required quite a bit of travel,

412
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,640
so Eduardo being away felt normal.

413
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,446
I can't believe he's gone.

414
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,780
Do you recognize this woman?

415
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,680
I don't. Who is she?

416
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,960
I'm sorry, but Eduardo
was not traveling for work.

417
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,720
We found his body in
a Hollywood hotel room.

418
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,280
He was with this woman
the night he was murdered.

419
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,056
What the hell was that? Woman
just found out her husband died.

420
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,546
Maybe give it a sec before you
whip out a picture of his mistress.

421
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,360
If Regina knew about Eduardo's infidelity,

422
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,826
she had strong motive to kill him.

423
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,926
I needed to get her unvarnished reaction.

424
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,470
Ooh. That's good. Didn't think about that.

425
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,920
It seems like there's a lot about
this job you don't think about.

426
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,556
You know, like taking
evidence home with you.

427
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,006
You know, every once in
a while I start to get tricked

428
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,976
into thinking that maybe
you're a normal person.

429
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,040
And then, sure enough, you remind
me you're just a heartless police robot.

430
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,496
Why would Eduardo use a fake ID?

431
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,506
Why would someone change their entire
identity just to cheat on their wife?

432
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,676
Doesn't add up.

433
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,676
Finances don't really add up either.

434
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,096
Sweet apartment, the car, altering
suits to make 'em look expensive.

435
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,670
Yep. Go home, get rest and
do not take evidence with you.

436
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,710
It was a pretty normal day.

437
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,416
Ava was glued to her phone.

438
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,826
Elliot worked on his geography project.

439
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,936
Chloe ate a crayon,
but it was a green one.

440
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,526
So I feel it was the most
natural and least toxic.

441
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,070
Did Chloe have a guest?

442
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,110
Chloe, the baby, did not have a guest.

443
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,450
She didn't have any, floppy-haired
teenage boys swing by?

444
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,040
I knew this was coming. Look,
Ryder seems like a nice kid.

445
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,630
- I think it's fine.
- It's not fine.

446
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,606
We both knew that she was gonna
have friends over sooner or later.

447
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,390
- Ava's 15.
- What were you doing when you were 15?

448
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,980
Lifting. Hanging with my boys.

449
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,476
I'm kidding, I didn't lift or
have boys. But Ava's different.

450
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,130
I know Ava's different, but
teenage boys are all the same.

451
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,280
Well, we're both trying
to figure it out, okay?

452
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,920
I think we just need to trust Ava.

453
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,146
- So let's calm down, and...
- don't tell me to calm down.

454
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,076
- You overstepped in a major way.
- Okay.

455
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,006
You're on one of your famous Morgan rants,
so I'm gonna give you a little space.

456
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,876
I am not on a Morgan rant.

457
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,560
I am doing what's best for
my kid. Ava is my daughter.

458
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,560
Right. I'm just the Manny.

459
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,460
That's not what I said.

460
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,080
That's not what I meant. You don't

461
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,950
can you please come
back here so we can

462
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,686
okay.

463
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,106
Eduardo's life just doesn't add up.

464
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,130
I'm late. I'm sorry. Sorry I'm late.

465
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,526
It was a crazy kid morning,
but who cares about that?

466
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,526
Who cares about kids?

467
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,006
- I brought doughnuts.
- Hell yeah.

468
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,110
I love it when you're late.

469
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,876
Ooh. So many options.

470
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,566
Can't go wrong with glaze, right?

471
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,186
- Never.
- No.

472
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,420
Maybe it's a sprinkles day.

473
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,676
- Might be a sprinkles day.
- Yeah. I don't know. Is that a jelly

474
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,940
- just pick a damn doughnut.
- Okay.

475
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,506
Medical examiner's report just came in.

476
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,190
Eduardo Cortez's cause
of death is drowning

477
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,230
with trace amounts of
alcohol in his system.

478
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,036
But he looked sober on the cctv
footage when he was walking with Iris.

479
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,686
Bartender says he tied one on.

480
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,936
Could have been all the Xanax
the lab found in his system.

481
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,680
They also found
residue on the glassware.

482
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:12,620
Well, Xanax's main side effects
are severe drowsiness and dizziness.

483
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,736
Still, no one other than Dr. Bowman used
the key card to enter the room that night.

484
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,520
But the cameras
proved she isn't the killer.

485
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,800
What if the murderer entered the room
in a way that didn't require a key card?

486
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,816
What are you talking about, Morgan?

487
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,700
I'm talking about the murderer going
into the room through the window.

488
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,126
The room is on the fourth floor.

489
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,980
You'd have to be spider-man.

490
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,470
Really, oz? I brought doughnuts.

491
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,160
Look, would it be easy? No.
But is it doable? I think so.

492
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,160
Right here.

493
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,246
I didn't see it when I was there in person.

494
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,626
There was a crime scene
photographer standing in front of me.

495
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,650
But... do you see?

496
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,030
- What are we looking at?
- The window latches.

497
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,596
See? All of those are turned
to the left except for this one,

498
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,860
which is turned to the right,
which means it's unlocked.

499
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,660
The murderer could have done the
deed and then exited through the window

500
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,746
but not been able to
lock it from the outside.

501
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:02,430
Except it's on the fourth floor, Morgan.

502
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,880
What other leads do we have?

503
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,096
Cortez's financials.

504
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,926
A prelim check showed he had no debt.

505
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,926
Lived in a fancy apartment.
Drove a beat-up car.

506
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,136
Yeah. He did wear old suits and
doctor 'em up to look expensive.

507
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,230
All right. Keep digging into his finances.

508
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,586
Oz, check out Morgan's window theory.

509
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,200
Yes!

510
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,596
Here you go, sir.

511
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,690
Thanks.

512
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,090
It was a yellow light.
You could have just gone.

513
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,230
Hey. Big news.

514
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,060
I just got back from the hotel.

515
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,836
Manager said it's policy for
the cleaners to lock the windows

516
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,566
when they finish cleaning
the room each morning.

517
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,240
So if a window was unlocked,
guest must have done it that day.

518
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,930
So it was left unlocked.

519
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,706
But the question wasn't whether
the window was unlocked.

520
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,226
- Could someone get up to the window?
- - I think someone could.

521
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,110
Not me but someone.

522
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,746
Look, there are recessed
windows and a lot of ledges.

523
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:17,096
In between those,
crevices and indentations.

524
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,260
But check this out.

525
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:21,926
What is that? Powder?

526
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,656
Yes, it's powder. It's
magnesium carbonate.

527
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,936
- That's the powder climbers use.
- Hey, guys.

528
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,200
Okay. Thank you.

529
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,356
You wanted a deep dive
into Eduardo Cortez's money?

530
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,736
I just learned he deposited
checks totaling more than 200,000

531
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,086
in the past year from a
woman named glenda Walker.

532
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,590
Her address.

533
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,366
This is it.

534
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,096
Feel like an assisted-living community

535
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,160
isn't a hotbed for criminal activity.

536
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,370
LAPD. Is this glenda Walker's room?

537
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,230
Yeah.

538
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,790
Can we ask her some questions?

539
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,310
You can try.

540
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,210
Glenda, do you know Eduardo Cortez?

541
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,870
I am sorry, I-I don't. Should I?

542
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,150
What about Ernest lozano?

543
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,786
Yes.

544
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,740
Ernest is my fiancé.

545
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,810
We made plans to fly to Mexico City.

546
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,020
He's picking me up any minute now.

547
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,410
Can I ask why you gave him $200,000?

548
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,830
She what?

549
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,356
Mom? Is that true?

550
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,116
It's for our home in Mexico City.

551
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,350
I gave Ernest my half, and
he is taking care of everything.

552
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,016
It has a lovely guest room just for Kyle.

553
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,190
Kyle, do you mind if we speak in private?

554
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,920
Yeah.

555
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,720
How long has she been like this?

556
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,680
My mom got diagnosed
almost a year ago.

557
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,766
It's getting worse.
Doctors say it's dementia.

558
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,456
Yeah. You ever meet this Ernest?

559
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,946
No. No, I was living up
north when they first met.

560
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,420
So, my mom got sick.
Stopped hearing from the guy.

561
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,306
We're gonna have to
establish some boundaries,

562
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,136
'cause karadec was
just here the other night.

563
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,750
I have a Roman question.

564
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,270
So this.

565
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,960
Roman's work.

566
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,240
Bird's wing or fishtail?

567
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,906
Please tell me it's a bird's
wing. I got 50 bucks on it.

568
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,806
- It's a bird's wing.
- Yes!

569
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,806
It's a Phoenix actually. Do
you wanna see the whole thing?

570
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,420
I would, in fact.

571
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,250
Is this relevant to anything
other than your bet?

572
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,250
A month before he went missing,

573
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,266
Roman was cited for painting a
mural in an unauthorized location.

574
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:11,406
Back then, the area was a
hotbed for criminal activity.

575
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,826
- Roman wasn't a criminal.
- I wonder if he saw something in the area

576
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,246
- he shouldn't have.
- I don't know.

577
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:19,176
He didn't say anything about
it. I'm sure he would have.

578
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,340
Wow.

579
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,270
- Isn't that cool?
- It really is.

580
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,760
Keep it. Keep all of them.
They might be useful.

581
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,140
- Great.
- Do you want a cookie?

582
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,466
I'm not sure if that's a
serious question or not.

583
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:34,800
- But if it is, yes.
- I don't joke around about cookies.

584
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,096
I'm not concerned about your bowels.

585
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,440
I just hide the good stuff
where the kids will never look.

586
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,200
You are a genius.

587
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,750
Had I known this when
I was raising my kids,

588
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,860
my books would've
been full with cookies.

589
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,860
I bet you could fit a lot
of cookies in a dictionary.

590
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,080
Thank you for letting me
look at your daddy's gift.

591
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,516
My. How much is in there?

592
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,170
Ballpark. Fifty grand.

593
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,930
Where did Eduardo get this money?

594
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,510
Working theory,

595
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,076
he was seducing vulnerable women
and scamming them out of their money.

596
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,356
Take it away. Give it
back to those women.

597
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,496
Wanna see my Stanley photos?

598
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,350
I sure do want to see
your Stanley photos. Cute.

599
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,190
That's my daddy.

600
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,966
- There he is.
- Here I am.

601
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,310
- Saved you a stool.
- Thank you.

602
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,370
Your, drink's on the way.

603
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,556
Dirty vodka Martini on the rocks.

604
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,176
Weird drink for my weird guy.

605
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,046
Yeah, well, Martini
glasses are what's weird.

606
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,070
It's poorly designed barware.
Terrible for people with large hands.

607
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,630
And how did you guess my drink?

608
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,860
I've been cleaning up in
major crimes for months.

609
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,196
I know you better
than you know yourself.

610
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,630
- You do?
- I do.

611
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,430
Okay. Well, tell me about myself then.

612
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,646
You fill your car up every two weeks
at the same spot next to union station.

613
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,600
You love yourself a
French dip from Philippe's.

614
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,500
You avoid the 405 at all costs.

615
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:32,586
And, your favorite doughnut is
not a doughnut. It's an apple fritter.

616
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,270
So where was my fritter earlier?

617
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,656
I haven't decided if I like you yet.

618
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,526
What was so important that we
couldn't talk about it on the phone?

619
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,650
Yes.

620
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,046
So we know that Eduardo was conning
rich, vulnerable women to get their money.

621
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:50,900
And who meets a lot of
rich, vulnerable women?

622
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,190
A hotel bartender.

623
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,600
Hey!

624
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,340
What are you doing?

625
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,690
I'm not going back to prison.

626
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,480
Oz, put the gun down.

627
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,790
- Yeah, they went out the front.
- Morgan!

628
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,420
- Check the back door.
- Yes, ma'am.

629
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,236
Why didn't you tell me
what I was walking into?

630
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,716
- I didn't know all that was gonna happen.
- I could've gotten stabbed.

631
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,236
Okay. I think you're
overreacting just a teeny bit.

632
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:44,106
I am not overreacting. We
both could've been seriously hurt.

633
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,386
But we didn't, right? And how about
a little bit of gratitude, by the way?

634
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,456
Gratitude. Gratitude for what?

635
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,316
I gave you a break in the case.

636
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,046
Thank you, Morgan, for
giving me a break in the case

637
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,566
in the most idiotic way possible.

638
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:59,396
How can someone as smart as
you are do so many stupid things?

639
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:03,466
Why does everyone feel like they
have the right to just call me stupid?

640
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:06,266
I don't have to take this. I
don't need this job that bad.

641
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,980
- Fine. This job does not need you.
- Perfect. I quit.

642
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,800
- There is no way Morgan quit.
- That's what I heard.

643
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,416
She stormed off at the hotel.

644
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
Karadec.

645
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,870
Daphne, meet me in interrogation.

646
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,690
Oz, get started on the paperwork.

647
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:35,296
Assault, battery, extortion,
buying and selling of stolen goods.

648
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,776
And Eduardo Cortez's murder.

649
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,606
We know you guys
shared a cell in prison.

650
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,700
What was your relationship like
with Eduardo after being released?

651
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,740
Look, you pulled a knife on a cop.

652
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:48,570
You wanna minimize your
jail time, this is your chance.

653
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:53,796
When I got out, I was
doing okay bar tending.

654
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,270
But I knew that Eduardo was struggling.

655
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,626
He helped me on the
inside, so I felt like I owed him.

656
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,806
When I started at the hotel,
he came up with a plan.

657
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,216
To exploit vulnerable women.

658
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,806
I only gave him possible marks.

659
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,806
After that, whatever Eduardo
did with these women is on him.

660
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,296
But you got a finder's fee.

661
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,396
Sure, but I had nothing
to do with his death.

662
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,560
Why would I want Eduardo killed?

663
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,570
He was my goose that laid golden eggs.

664
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,316
Prado admitted to running
a con with our victim,

665
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,750
but he lawyered up, so...

666
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,696
Any other leads?

667
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,240
Yeah, a few. I'll chase 'em down.

668
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,140
One more thing. Morgan quit.

669
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:43,566
She didn't quit.

670
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,676
No, she made it pretty clear.

671
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,336
I chewed her out after the hotel incident,

672
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,506
and she stormed off yelling
she didn't need the job.

673
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:53,260
She'll be back. She needs this.

674
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,510
You quit?

675
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,726
Well, he was yelling. I was
yelling. I don't know. I felt attacked.

676
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,650
- I really liked that job.
- Liked? I loved that job.

677
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,216
It was a sweet gig, and
they paid me for childcare.

678
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,400
So, wait, why did you call me all the
way over here if you didn't need a Manny?

679
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,776
I just wanted to tell you in person

680
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,180
that I'm really sorry about
what I said to you the other night.

681
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,366
You're the closest
thing Ava has to a father,

682
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,640
and we're all really lucky
to have you in our lives.

683
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,570
Thanks.

684
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,206
Now, if you can just
apologize like that to the LAPD,

685
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,826
I'm pretty sure you could
get that sweet job back.

686
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,556
LAPD are bossy. You know
how I feel about authority.

687
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,340
I do know.

688
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,216
Hot dog on a stick.

689
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,496
H&r block. Magic castle.

690
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,566
Kaiser permanente sunset,
kaiser permanente culver city.

691
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,830
- Kaiser permanente...
- I get it. I quit a lot.

692
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:53,910
Well, we'll figure it out.

693
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,916
Although, I do think I should
tell you, yesterday at pickup,

694
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,670
I heard Elliot bragging to his classmates
about his mom being a detective.

695
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:05,260
I've never heard Elliot boasting
about his driving instructor dad

696
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,230
or his cleaning lady mom, have you?

697
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,246
We gotta tell him to stop bragging
about his mom being a cop.

698
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,370
Everyone's gonna think he's a narc.

699
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,340
Thanks for the apology.

700
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,930
Bye.

701
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,336
Prado's lawyer made it clear,
there's no confession coming.

702
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,266
Yeah, it's fine. He's not our guy.

703
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,306
Couldn't have been in the
hotel room at the time of death.

704
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,376
Staff confirmed his alibi, and
we're getting security footage

705
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,920
- from the downstairs bar...
- and his nails.

706
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,920
- I told you.
- Thanks.

707
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,796
I know which one I want.

708
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,930
Can we please get back to the case?

709
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,410
Yes. As I was saying, his fingernails.

710
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,806
What about 'em? The victim
wasn't scratched to death, Morgan.

711
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:57,930
No, he was not.

712
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,210
But, in order to climb
the exterior of a hotel

713
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,800
and get into the fourth-floor window,

714
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,466
the murderer would
have to have short nails.

715
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,816
The bartender had long,
flamenco-guitar nails.

716
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,576
But you know who has short nails?

717
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,336
- I do.
- Me too.

718
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,406
We all have short nails. So
what? We're all murderers?

719
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,830
- What's your point, Morgan?
- This question is for karadec.

720
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,230
Do you know who has short fingernails?

721
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,300
Members of the long
beach climbing club.

722
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,790
Kyle.

723
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,666
- Explain.
- Kyle's a climber.

724
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,496
He could easily get up in that window.

725
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,760
<i>He snuck up on Eduardo.
He forced him underwater.</i>

726
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,590
Kyle wanted revenge for his mother.

727
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,530
Daphne, oz, go arrest Kyle
Walker. Get him back here asap.

728
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,250
Excellent work, Morgan.

729
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:44,360
Detective, get the
confession and close it up.

730
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,956
I thought you quit.

731
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,810
I did.

732
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,990
But you need me, admit it.

733
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,990
- Good work, Morgan.
- Thank you.

734
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,346
You couldn't have done it alone.

735
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,356
What'd you say?

736
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,660
I said, "you couldn't have done it alone."

737
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,830
Kyle. Kyle couldn't have done it alone.

738
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,916
He doesn't appear on
any of the cctv footage.

739
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,986
He had an accomplice, someone
who drugged Eduardo's drink.

740
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,366
Someone who unlatched the window.

741
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,980
Someone who was already
inside the room that night.

742
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,990
I already explained the
nature of our relationship.

743
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:33,820
Sure. But you left out the part
where you gave Eduardo $390,000.

744
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:37,410
We know he lied to you.
We know he took your money.

745
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:41,900
What we wanna know is,
how did you meet Kyle Walker?

746
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:54,020
So, Kyle, how did you come
into contact with Dr. Iris bowman?

747
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,610
I met Kyle at the hotel.

748
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,540
I started staking out the place
where I knew she met this new guy.

749
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,586
And that's where you met Iris?

750
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,790
She was with him.

751
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,456
I... I just wanted to ruin his scam.

752
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,426
So, I tried to warn her, but it was...

753
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,116
Too late. I-I'd already given him so much.

754
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:22,016
I was humiliated. I was furious.
But Kyle wanted revenge.

755
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,776
I'm saying that we get even.

756
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,506
He came up with a plan to kill him.

757
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:29,530
It was Iris. She wanted revenge.

758
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,980
The police can't help us.

759
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,516
You could have taken
this to the authorities.

760
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,686
We could have helped you.

761
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,780
Help? No one could help me.

762
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,136
One day I was married
to the love of my life,

763
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,966
and the next day he was gone.

764
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:46,720
I spent six months convinced I'd never
be whole again, let alone love again.

765
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:51,566
And then in a hotel bar,
of all places... I met Ernest.

766
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,390
He brought light back into my life.

767
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,390
And in return, I gave him everything.

768
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,500
He said my money was going to
our vacation house in Mexico City.

769
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:07,400
So, once Kyle told me
about the scam, I just...

770
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,990
Decided to take back what was mine.

771
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:16,176
See, that's the thing, Kyle. It
doesn't matter who came up with what.

772
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,200
You're both complicit.

773
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,480
Can I ask you guys something?

774
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:26,496
What kind of man takes advantage of a
woman whose memory is-is so far gone

775
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,940
that she doesn't even
know who or where she is?

776
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,506
Who targets a mother
whose memory is so eroded

777
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,530
that she doesn't even
remember her son?

778
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,160
Come on, Kyle. It's time to go.

779
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,686
Hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

780
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,990
Before you lock me up or
whatever you're gonna do.

781
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,620
I need to say goodbye to my mom.

782
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,700
All set.

783
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,536
<i>Hey, mom, I'm in Colorado now.</i>

784
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,716
You got the job.

785
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,910
<i>Yeah, you're looking at rocky
mountain park's newest employee.</i>

786
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:18,990
That is fantastic, sweetie. You
always wanted to move there.

787
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,230
I'm not gonna be able
to stop by anymore.

788
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,480
But i-I'm gonna call you,
okay? I'm gonna check in.

789
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,076
Will you promise me that you're
gonna keep up with your physical

790
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,000
<i>you worry too much
about me. You always have.</i>

791
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,590
I'll be okay.

792
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,210
<i>Hey, I love you, mom.</i>

793
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,660
I love you too.

794
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,060
Karadec, I was wrong.

795
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,270
You're not a heartless police robot.

796
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,720
Just a regular police robot.

797
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,690
Well, I'll, see you tomorrow.
