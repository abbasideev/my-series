1
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,192
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

2
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,794
Mr. Sterling's inside.

3
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,110
Do you want ice?

4
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,759
Coffee.

5
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,040
It's one thing to be near the bar.
It's another thing to be under it.

6
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,759
Sunkist sent us a crate.

7
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,480
I've seen blind people juggle, but somehow
it seems to be beyond me.

8
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,200
Just close your eyes.
That's what you did in the meeting.

9
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,590
Whatever I did, it worked. We're in it.

10
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,830
That's good news.

11
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,400
Step one, I send it to research.

12
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,995
Step two, you'll need to get
that little idea factory working.

13
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,992
There's only one angle-

14
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,357
an orange... that's <i>orange</i> on TV.

15
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,875
I thought they were pretty clear
they're too cheap to get out of print.

16
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,838
So talk 'em out of it or into it.

17
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,152
I'd love to, but I think
it demands a media strategy.

18
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,232
Forget research. Put Harry Crane on it.

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,560
Look at you.

20
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,360
See?
Not all surprises are bad.

21
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,715
The ants, they look like people.

22
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,076
He should be right out.
Is there anything I can get you?

23
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,551
- I think she would like a cup of tea.
- In a teacup.

24
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,270
I'd be more excited if we didn't have to
go in Ted's plane to present.

25
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,398
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Peter.

26
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,153
Manolo, may I speak with you a moment?

27
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,994
Of course, Mr. Campbell.
Your tea is coming.

28
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,675
I'll be fine. I'm not a child.

29
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,439
Peggy, would you mind?

30
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,509
Mrs. Campbell, nice to meet you.

31
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,672
There's no reason for you
to be so formal, dear.

32
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,274
Sit with me.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,798
How are you today?

34
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,033
I can't tell you how much it relieves me
to see you and Peter reunited.

35
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,511
Well, it was really
a by-product of the merger.

36
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,116
I'm glad you both swallowed your pride,
if nothing else...

37
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,556
but for the good of the child
you have together.

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,069
Excuse me?

39
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,039
Oh, I've embarrassed you.

40
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,999
Your son and I are not together that way.

41
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,680
Trudy, dear, don't deny him.

42
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,558
Don't reject his caresses.

43
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,035
Mrs. Campbell-

44
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,680
I hope you two can someday find...

45
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,116
what Manolo and I have found.

46
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,838
I waited long enough...

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,994
to experience the physical
satisfactions of love.

48
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,392
Did she go to China for that tea?

49
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,716
Thank you for driving her out to Bud's.

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,439
I've paid you for the extra day.

51
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,000
I know that you don't drive.

52
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,834
Well, I do, but not to her satisfaction.

53
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,840
Bob Benson was right about you.
You're worth every penny.

54
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,196
Bob is a wonderful salesman.

55
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,398
Still, I want you to have
a little something off the books.

56
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,233
Mr. Campbell, I refuse.

57
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,880
It's important to me that
you treat my mother well...

58
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,440
but also that you treat yourself.

59
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,513
- The pleasure is all mine.
- I know that isn't true.

60
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,998
Sally, get in here.

61
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,674
Hello.

62
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,670
What?

63
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,878
Julie's mother called and told me you
were the only two girls on the trip.

64
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,871
So?

65
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,794
You're not staying in a Midtown hotel
with all those boys.

66
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,712
Miss O'Shea's gonna be there.

67
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,280
She's 25.

68
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,079
What's the point of having a mansion...

69
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,237
if you're gonna spend
all your time in here?

70
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,552
Fine, I won't do the Model UN.
It was his idea.

71
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,120
Fine, you're not going.

72
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,510
- Can't we stay with Daddy?
- You mean with no one.

73
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,160
You hate that Daddy supports my dreams.

74
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,120
He doesn't think
I'm just a pain in the ass.

75
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,351
Your father is a hero.

76
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,759
Like everything else in this country...

77
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,275
Diplomacy Club's just
another excuse to make out.

78
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,354
I thought she should join
the Student Congress. The UN's a joke.

79
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,120
- Oh, you're home.
- Who's this?

80
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,556
This is Mitchell- Sylvia and Arnold's son.

81
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,872
Nice to finally meet you,
Mitchell. I'm Don.

82
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,760
Thanks again, Megan.

83
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,430
What did he want?

84
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,874
Um-

85
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,638
I'm sworn to secrecy,
but he's in a lot of trouble.

86
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,790
What happened?

87
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,630
He's 1-A.

88
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,033
But he's in school.

89
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,672
He sent back his draft card in protest.
They reclassified him.

90
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,436
What did he think was gonna happen?
Stupid kid.

91
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,480
Don, he knows he screwed up.
He wants to run.

92
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,150
You know, to Canada.

93
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,598
I suppose I could call my brother-in-law,
but I can't do that to Sylvia and Arnold.

94
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,320
- Can I?
- Just leave it alone.

95
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,995
- He's so scared.
- He should be.

96
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,430
He can't spend the rest
of his life on the run.

97
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,796
I know how you feel...

98
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,752
but you don't want him to go to Vietnam.

99
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,832
Megan, it's not our problem.

100
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,231
Could you get me another whiskey sour?

101
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,476
Sure.

102
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,358
Maybe I'll switch to whiskey sours.

103
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,874
How about a Shirley Temple then?

104
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,395
I don't think Dramamine
and booze go together.

105
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,711
I don't think Dramamine
and cranberry juice go together either.

106
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,395
But I thought we'd be back
on your little plane...

107
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,994
not having a romantic dinner.

108
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,152
- Don't you want to celebrate?
- I want to live, Ted.

109
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,640
What?

110
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,313
He doesn't like flying.

111
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,998
Well, you've seen how simple it is now.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

112
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,312
My father died in a plane crash.

113
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,074
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

114
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,156
Was he a pilot?

115
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,118
Ha! No.

116
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,839
A passenger.

117
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,550
Look, you're driving. Can we please,
please have another round?

118
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,359
You still have to get home
from White Plains.

119
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,959
I'll hail a cab.

120
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,633
He's such a New Yorker.

121
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,153
This is the agency I always wanted.

122
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,317
Ambition, brains, and beauty.

123
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,312
Yeah, but what about him?

124
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,995
I'm gonna cut you off too, my dear.

125
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,520
I should call home.

126
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,191
If the check comes,
I'm sending it to Ocean Spray.

127
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,791
Can you imagine what it does to his wife
every time he takes that plane?

128
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,554
I guess so.

129
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,073
You don't want me to talk about his wife.

130
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,958
You don't know what you're talking about.

131
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,716
But I do. I've seen that look.

132
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,880
I know, but-

133
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,760
nothing can happen.

134
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,877
And he's in love with you too.

135
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,399
You're the one who's in love with him.

136
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,552
Well, I could use an account,
and he's been generous.

137
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,077
At least one of us ended up important.

138
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,550
Please tell me you don't pity me.

139
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,674
I don't.

140
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,036
Because you really know me.

141
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,035
I do.

142
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,071
I should tell you...

143
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,191
I had a very strange
conversation with your mother.

144
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,317
There's no other kind.

145
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,158
Well, it doesn't matter.

146
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,311
What did she say?

147
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,752
I think she thought I was your wife...

148
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,629
and Manuel was her husband.

149
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,233
My father never treated her that well.

150
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,711
Maybe that's it.
She thinks she's in love with him.

151
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,474
I could see it. Manolo is very charming.

152
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,477
I don't think you understand.

153
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,474
She thinks she's... making love with him.

154
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,838
Tell me exactly what she said.

155
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,951
Did your father ever
give her spa treatments...

156
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,511
that released a "fire in her loins"?

157
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,829
Oh!

158
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,232
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

159
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,912
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have told you.

160
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,957
But I can't get the image
out of my head.

161
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,554
Stop it, please.

162
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,314
I don't even want to think
about her brushing her teeth.

163
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,153
I thought I cut you two off.

164
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,197
Ted, I have never been
less afraid of flying in my life.

165
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,832
What? What does he mean?

166
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,149
Nothing.

167
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,079
Well, I should get the check.

168
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,919
Honey, who's that gonna be?

169
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,112
- Arnold.
- Is it too late?

170
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,953
For what? Come in.

171
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,592
Look, I would have called,
but Sylvia is-

172
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,040
Listen, about this afternoon-

173
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,676
Oh, hello, Arnold.

174
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,036
I'm sorry about my kid dropping in on you.

175
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,676
I didn't know if I should tell you.

176
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,319
Well, he figured you would...

177
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,232
and I don't want you
in the middle of this.

178
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,711
His mother's treating it like he's dying.
She doesn't want anyone to know.

179
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,874
Do you want a drink?

180
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,351
Sit up here drinking while they're down
there slamming the doors?

181
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,397
<i>And you lied to me.</i>

182
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,631
Been meaning to knock on your door anyway.

183
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,313
You know, catch a game or something.

184
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,076
I get baseball tickets. Mostly the Mets.

185
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,719
Well, then I'm glad you didn't.

186
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,117
You know, I didn't
even know he left school.

187
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,437
Sylvia says she didn't know either.

188
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,270
She's doing that a lot lately-
lying about little things.

189
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,591
Could tell something's
been wrong all year.

190
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,274
- Another Manhattan?
- Nah. No.

191
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,432
Should have never let him go to Paris.

192
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,352
He got there right in
the middle of the riots.

193
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,193
His French is excellent.

194
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,950
I think he got a lot of girls
as an expatriate revolutionary.

195
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,474
Could kill him right now.

196
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,719
There has to be a way.

197
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,872
Oh, believe me,
everybody's an expert on it.

198
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,714
Sylvia's father was suddenly
Clarence Darrow.

199
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,520
It's thrilling to see
a plumber interpret international law.

200
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,597
You're one of the top
surgeons in the country.

201
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,879
You must know somebody.

202
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,595
I know a lot of people,
but it doesn't matter.

203
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,717
It doesn't matter
if he goes back to school.

204
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,833
He's 1-A.
His induction could be tomorrow.

205
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,230
He's on a damn list
for the rest of his life.

206
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,115
On some level, you have
to admire his idealism.

207
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,759
You sound like Sylvia.

208
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,752
But she doesn't really buy his bullshit.

209
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,072
You think she's gonna
let her baby rot in jail for a cause?

210
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,880
I don't know what to do.

211
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,279
What would you do?

212
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,920
If it was my kid, or if it was me?

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,514
You were in the service, right?

214
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,670
I was.

215
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,513
You see action?

216
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,199
It was very different.

217
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,794
I wanted to go.

218
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,793
And then when I got there, well-

219
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,599
That's the trick.

220
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,997
Kids 18, 19 years old,
they have no sense of their own mortality.

221
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,639
Or anyone else's.

222
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,197
That's why they make good soldiers.

223
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,272
Well, the army paid for med school.

224
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,396
I served in a hospital in Pusan.

225
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,993
We were very lucky.

226
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,640
Lucky enough to live in this country.

227
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,519
And service is part of that bargain-
sacrifice.

228
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,359
We knew that.

229
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,636
The war is wrong.

230
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,352
I'll tell you right now, if anyone was
ever gonna get it, it's gonna be him.

231
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,959
He's soft.

232
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,753
I'm sure he's a good kid.

233
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,989
The best.

234
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,311
<i>Cold pills and capsules
take a while, don't they?</i>

235
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,717
<i>Dristan Mist can unlock sinus blockage.</i>

236
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,519
What you watching?

237
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,114
I don't know.

238
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,270
What's the matter? I called.

239
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,511
I didn't want to get into it
when you're about to fly...

240
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,114
but you were supposed
to have dinner with us.

241
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,237
I made a mistake. We'll do it tomorrow.

242
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,516
You don't have to make
a federal case out of it.

243
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,319
Why don't you get a legal pad
and write down...

244
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,959
a bunch of excuses for the next week?

245
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,679
Because none of them
mean anything to the boys.

246
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,156
What about food, clothing and shelter?
Does that mean anything?

247
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,234
Remember what the minister
said at Frank's funeral?

248
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,199
"God can turn off the lights
at any moment."

249
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,670
You know where you're gonna be?
The office.

250
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,274
This is temporary.

251
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,873
I just have to do this until-

252
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,155
Until what?

253
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,790
Until you... are
back where you were at the old firm?

254
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,111
Because things weren't
so great then either.

255
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,711
So we've moved on from
I'm working too much to something else.

256
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,635
The problem is, even
when you do come home, you're not here.

257
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,359
You're obsessed.

258
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,878
And I can feel how disappointing this all is
compared to your battles at work.

259
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,440
I'm not enjoying that.

260
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,799
How did we get to the point where you
think I don't want you to enjoy things?

261
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,398
I know you like having
a young copywriter in your airplane.

262
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,312
Come on, Pete was there too.

263
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,155
And I know you like facing Don Draper
every morning more than the clients.

264
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,519
How was your day?

265
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,756
I just wish you liked being here more.

266
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,754
Could you get Mr. Campbell?

267
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,877
Do you want to see him
before the status meeting?

268
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,037
- When's that?
- Now.

269
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,635
And I also need to know
if you're attending the Chevrolet dinner.

270
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,552
- When's that?
- Tonight.

271
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,556
- Morning.
- May I speak with you?

272
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,157
Does your friend still work
at the Department of Defense?

273
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,038
No, he left for Union Carbide.

274
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,191
But he probably still has pull over there.

275
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,872
What happened now?

276
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,830
You must know plenty of people
with kids getting deferments.

277
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,479
How are they doing that?

278
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,110
They go to college.
Divinity school. Medical baloney.

279
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,079
No, it's too late for that. I need someone
who can really pull strings.

280
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,913
Well, aren't you having dinner
with General Motors...

281
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,117
one of the largest
defense contractors in the world?

282
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,833
What are the politics of that?

283
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,832
I don't know, Don. I'm not on Chevy.

284
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,833
Shall we?

285
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,673
That's not my fault.

286
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,915
Don't worry. If I had Chevy...

287
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,232
I wouldn't be able to devote
my full attention to Ocean Spray.

288
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,040
- Cranberries?
- Cranberry Cocktail.

289
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,351
And they like us so much,
they might even give us the blends.

290
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,000
- What about Sunkist?
- What about it?

291
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,150
It's orange juice.

292
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,990
Morning, everyone.

293
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,549
- Did you know about Sunkist?
- What about it?

294
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,950
Don told Harry to put together
a media plan right away.

295
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,912
Why didn't you tell us about that?

296
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,593
Isn't this the meeting where I tell you?

297
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,194
Are we having this meeting?

298
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,112
Why didn't you tell us
you were presenting to Ocean Spray?

299
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,714
There's been a series of memos.

300
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,672
Didn't you wonder where everybody was?

301
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,474
- We can't present to both.
- Which one is bigger?

302
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,155
They're about the same. Three million.

303
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,516
We've already spent $5,000 on Ocean Spray.

304
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,120
What about our trip to California?

305
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,078
Was it $5,000?

306
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,039
I have a lot of receipts.
I haven't figured it out yet.

307
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,397
Why don't you join this company
and read a memo once in a while?

308
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,878
Maybe they're not a conflict.

309
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,474
We don't have either yet.

310
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,754
I really didn't know.

311
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,877
I warned you about the memos, Ted.

312
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,952
The more you send, the less they get read.

313
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,000
Imagine if every time
Ginger Rogers jumped in the air...

314
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,517
Fred Astaire punched her in the face.

315
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,472
Why are you taking this to heart?

316
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,230
Because it's directed at me.
Can you not see that?

317
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,279
So what?
You know we'll end up with just one juice.

318
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,359
I don't want his juice. I want my juice.

319
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,352
It's all your juice.

320
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,954
Tell him that.

321
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,034
Michigan's in the Big Ten.

322
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,238
Ron Kutchinski just ran
the fastest half mile in the world.

323
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,676
- He's going to the Olympics.
- You're selling yourself short.

324
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,558
I'm telling you, they would
be lucky to have you.

325
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,552
I got it.

326
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,718
Look at this. Got a couple
of high fashion models.

327
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,280
Aren't you a gentleman?

328
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,273
- Hey.
- Hello.

329
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,680
Youse two don't know each other.

330
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,480
These are my two favorite people.
Mitchell Rosen, 16A...

331
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,871
I'd like you to meet Sally Draper, 17B
and all points north.

332
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,872
I'm Julie. I'm crashing at Sally's.

333
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,474
Cool.

334
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,951
They were supposed to leave a key for me.
I lost mine.

335
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,800
Nobody said nothin' to me,
but that don't mean nothin'.

336
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,396
We were going to go out for dinner tonight.
What's good around here?

337
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,994
His mother's cooking.

338
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,471
Around here, it's just old people.

339
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,711
Are you a musician?

340
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,519
'Cause you look like one.

341
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,829
Who?

342
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,233
I don't see it. I'll let you in.

343
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,118
- Oh, good day to you, Mrs. Rosen.
- Hello.

344
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,476
- Mitchell, did you get a cab?
- I was waiting for you.

345
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,040
You're unbelievable.

346
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,237
I got it, Mrs. Rosen.
Do you know Sally and, um-

347
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,316
I'm Julie.

348
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,471
I'm sorry, girls.
We're in a bit of a rush.

349
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,392
I'll get your cab lickety-split.

350
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,597
Bring them right back.

351
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,631
You're living with Mark Lindsay.

352
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,439
I don't live here.

353
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,716
What are you doing here?
I said I'd meet you at La Grenouille.

354
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,038
Dorothy, you must let me
manage your calendar.

355
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,679
I'm not standing in the hallway.

356
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,433
Come in.

357
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,629
You get ready, Mr. Campbell.
I'll entertain her.

358
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,191
Actually, Manolo,
I'd like my mother to myself this evening.

359
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,079
Very well. Good night, my sweet.

360
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,440
Must he?

361
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,240
He has other plans, Mother.

362
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,313
Yes, Dorothy.
I'll be there when you wake.

363
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,039
- Can I fix you something?
- No.

364
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,396
Manolo doesn't like me to drink.

365
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,119
He likes me sharp.

366
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,399
It's so nice the way he looks after you.

367
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,598
Oh, Peter, he's a gift to me.

368
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,277
I just wanted to make sure
you're aware he's your nurse.

369
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,551
You are prone to moments of confusion.

370
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,874
I suppose there's a way
I could mistake your tone for concern.

371
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,670
Oh, I am concerned that you have-

372
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,479
how do I put this?-

373
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,831
misconstrued Manolo's
attention for affection.

374
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,078
If we're going to have
an adult conversation...

375
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,277
let's have an adult conversation.

376
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,999
Has he taken advantage of you?

377
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,632
Manny has awakened a part of me
that was long dormant.

378
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,999
Don't you think I'm entitled
to the pleasures of love?

379
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,072
Do not be more specific.

380
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,120
Since when is it any of your business
what goes on in my bedroom?

381
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,113
I am afraid that we are going
to have to let him go.

382
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,840
Oh, no. What did he do?

383
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,559
He's a pervert.

384
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,439
You were a sour little boy.

385
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,595
And you're a sour little man.

386
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,071
How could I expect you
to be understanding?

387
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,914
You've always been unlovable.

388
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,559
Now I've lost my appetite.
I'm leaving.

389
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,597
You'll never find your way home.

390
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,076
I have carfare...

391
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,152
and a piece of paper with my address...

392
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,278
written in his elegant handwriting.

393
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,430
Mother.

394
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,352
Cheesecake? Chocolate cake?

395
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,272
- Two of everything.
- And another round.

396
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,194
- Why not?
- Oh, I can never get enough of it.

397
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,954
Growing up in Cleveland,
my dad would take me right on Lake Erie.

398
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,520
But the water's gone bad now.

399
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,239
You should go to Florida.

400
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,835
Saltwater.
Down off the Keys, where the marlin run.

401
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,400
Write your own Hemingway story.

402
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,551
If you don't catch anything,
you have to blow your brains out.

403
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,716
So, Ross, where do you
take your kid fishing?

404
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,793
I just got the two girls, and they could
never keep their mouths shut.

405
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,360
But my grandson's just like me.

406
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,678
Last summer, we went up to Muskoka.
Ontario.

407
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,638
Jesus, now we gotta hear
about this kid again.

408
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,594
Brendan's at Antioch.

409
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,751
Yep, studying the classics.

410
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,469
But I hope he'll come to his senses.

411
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,276
He's got a couple of years
before he has decisions to make.

412
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,955
Well, as long as we're working together,
he's got a job with us.

413
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,037
Friend of mine's kid
just got to that point.

414
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,158
He doesn't have a lot of choices left.
1-A. Can you imagine?

415
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,554
Well, my heart goes out to him...

416
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,717
but that's just one of those problems
that can't be solved.

417
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,995
Yeah.

418
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,400
I've got two sons.

419
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,034
Thank God they're too young.

420
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,555
I don't even like to think about that.

421
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,994
I know.

422
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,679
My friend is just beside himself.

423
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,317
I mean, people are doing things though.

424
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,392
Believe me, we know about that.

425
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,994
Makes me sick.

426
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,600
Well, next year this time,
we'll have won the war.

427
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,592
We'll take Brendan to dinner,
get him plastered...

428
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,558
and have him read the menu in Latin.

429
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,276
Ted, are you an angler?

430
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,556
My hobby is coming up
with names for the XP.

431
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,000
Last one.

432
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,390
Okay.

433
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,396
"Things I like about Mitchell."

434
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,834
- "His ass"?
- Shh.

435
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,639
When did you see that?

436
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,479
I couldn't think of anything else.

437
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,870
What did you put?

438
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,800
"How he smiled at me."

439
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,758
"His shoulders."

440
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,240
"His red shirt."

441
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,593
You girls have a big day tomorrow.

442
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,832
And I can tell you right now, the next
time this door opens, it won't be me.

443
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,879
- Lights out.
- Good night, Mrs. Draper.

444
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,155
Why do you keep calling her that?

445
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,799
'Cause she hates it.

446
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,591
Think about it. He's right down there.

447
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,909
You should sneak down and kiss him.

448
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,439
He talked to you.

449
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,313
God, I wish I lived here.

450
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,879
- Yeah?
- Did I wake you?

451
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,351
- Yeah.
- There's a rat in my apartment.

452
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,479
Told you to get traps.

453
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,671
It's in the trap,
and it's mortally wounded.

454
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,558
I'm pretty sure,
'cause there's a lot of blood.

455
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,074
Did you call an ambulance?

456
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,675
You have to come over.
It went under the couch.

457
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,877
I can't even look.
What if it's still alive?

458
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,475
What if I lift the couch
and it starts flipping around?

459
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,519
I'm not your boyfriend.

460
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,833
Maybe I'll make it worth
your while if you come over.

461
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,594
No, you won't. Now good night.

462
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,832
- You're not interested?
- No.

463
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,236
Then why are you using your sexy voice?

464
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,719
Tuesday morning's great.

465
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,069
For what?

466
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,194
Oh. Why didn't you say so?

467
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,554
You can bring her.

468
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,717
It'll be dead by morning.

469
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,472
Eleanor Roosevelt.

470
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,316
I can't remember anything
'cause I didn't sleep.

471
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,880
Your floor smells like pee.

472
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,316
- No, it doesn't.
- Do I smell like pee?

473
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,437
You smell like Prell.

474
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,113
Sally, you're not ready?

475
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,192
I let the guest shower first.

476
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,760
Well, I have to go to work.

477
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,877
But first I have to put you two in a cab,
so shake a leg.

478
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,679
Oh, take out the trash.

479
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,513
I have to get ready.

480
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,752
I'll do it, Mrs. Draper.

481
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,672
It's Megan.

482
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,400
I would love to visit the studio sometime.

483
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,358
Well, hopefully I'll still have a job.

484
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,113
I have to make a phone call.

485
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,238
- Your agent?
- Yes, actually.

486
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,159
Could you get me some coffee?

487
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,312
What the hell were you up to last night?

488
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,036
<i>Mr. Draper?</i>

489
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,592
I'm fine, Dawn. You want some coffee?

490
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,512
What the hell were you thinking?

491
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,877
You said you weren't
going to be involved in Chevy until 1970.

492
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,317
So stay the hell out of it.
Stop trying to poison my relationship.

493
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,154
Last time I checked,
it's our relationship.

494
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,833
And not everything's about you, Ted.

495
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,593
Then be better at it.

496
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,195
- What are you talking about?
- You know this.

497
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,398
A client shouldn't have a single negative
feeling in your presence.

498
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,554
Not the food, not the wine
and certainly not the war.

499
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,313
I was just taking their temperature.

500
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,757
Why would you do that? It's Chevy, Don.

501
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,639
- You'd do it for your kid.
- But it's not your kid.

502
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,519
Oh, is it your kid?

503
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,353
No, it's my friend's kid.

504
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,672
Well, I bet you don't have
a lot of friends, Don...

505
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,717
so I'm going to assume this is important.

506
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,678
It is.

507
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,477
I just- I don't know what to do.

508
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,517
Do you know how young 19 is?

509
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,877
Did you ever think about talking to me
instead of our most important client?

510
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,440
I don't know. It's GM.

511
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,398
Who else has that kind
of clout in Washington?

512
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,073
Does he wear glasses?

513
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,953
I don't think so, but he could.

514
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,235
The guy who taught me to fly...

515
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,154
is a brigadier general
in the Air National Guard.

516
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,836
They're always looking for exceptional
young men to become pilots.

517
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,154
And you'd be willing to call him?

518
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,913
I'd consider it.

519
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,509
But first, you're
going to have to stop the war.

520
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,438
I can't stop the war, Ted.

521
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,553
Don't be an asshole, Don.
The war you're waging on me.

522
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,279
You have to lower your weapons.

523
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,158
What are you talking about?

524
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,153
I'm talking about how we are going
to get Ocean Spray.

525
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,472
So you need to stop chasing Sunkist.

526
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,950
You're not going to compete
with me like that anymore.

527
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,793
We're on the same damn side.

528
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,394
That's it?

529
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,358
Don't act like it's nothing.

530
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,511
It seems to be impossible so far.

531
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,238
You'd really do that?

532
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,510
Thank you.

533
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,951
This is not a handshake of gratitude.
This is a binding contract.

534
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,680
Of course.
Whatever you want.

535
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,433
That's what I want.

536
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,440
Hold on. What's the next step?

537
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,470
Tell the kid to write a letter about
his childhood dream of being a pilot.

538
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,791
And it better be convincing.
You should write it.

539
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,393
And tell him to get a haircut.

540
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,996
Be straight, Ted. What are the chances?

541
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,197
I'm going to call right now.

542
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,760
Thank you.

543
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,999
Can you get Dr. Rosen on the phone?

544
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,390
Rosen residence.

545
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,591
It's me. It's Don.

546
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,114
What do you want?

547
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,431
I'm trying to reach Arnold.

548
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,751
<i>The office said he was home sick.</i>

549
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,433
It's about Mitchell.

550
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,318
What? Tell me.

551
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,632
I know someone who knows someone
in the Air National Guard.

552
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,632
He's getting him a spot.

553
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,473
You told someone?

554
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,233
It's my partner.

555
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,471
He's doing me a favor.

556
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,559
Did you fix it?

557
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,317
He just wants Mitchell to cut his hair
and sign a letter.

558
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,637
And the two of you need to make sure
he follows through.

559
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,712
Oh, he'll follow through.

560
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,000
I bet.

561
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,956
My God, is it possible?

562
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,077
I think so, but we have to act fast.

563
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,995
They went upstate to the VA
to call on an army buddy.

564
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,753
I'll send them up tonight.

565
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,480
Sylvia, sweetheart, it's gonna be okay.

566
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,714
Are you there?

567
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,554
Yes.

568
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,671
Please, stop crying.

569
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,356
Oh. I feel better, but I'll feel better
when I know it's done.

570
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,720
Don.

571
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,234
Yes?

572
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,995
I can't believe you would do this for me.

573
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,993
You know I have children too.

574
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,720
I know that's not why you're doing it.

575
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,154
And I hope-

576
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,358
Well, I hope you know
that I was just frustrated with you.

577
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,034
I do now.

578
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,032
I didn't want you to fall in love.

579
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,357
You didn't feel anything?

580
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,439
No, I just-

581
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,877
I don't want to go through this again.

582
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,397
You were good to me.

583
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,756
Better than I was to you.

584
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,193
Are we going to lunch? Because-

585
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,714
Get in here and close the door.

586
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,554
You have given me a terrible problem,
and now you're going to fix it.

587
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,240
Is this about Sunkist?
Because I did some digging-

588
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,040
I told you we needed a nurse,
and you sent us a rapist.

589
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,713
Manolo?

590
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,793
In fact, I never told you anything.
You were just doing some digging.

591
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,440
Calm down. Sit down.

592
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,274
Bob.

593
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,798
She has the mind of a child.
That man took advantage of her.

594
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,598
I assume she told you this story.

595
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,433
Don't you have
your answer right there?

596
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,000
She says they're in love...

597
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,993
and it's the first time
in months she's seemed sure of anything.

598
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,472
I don't think that Manolo's
interests turn that way.

599
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,270
Great, so he's a degenerate.
That means he's capable of anything.

600
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,958
What exactly did she say?

601
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,157
Please, I'm just trying to forget it.

602
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,799
Drink that.

603
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,199
- You feel better now?
- I do.

604
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,360
Can I ask you something?
Did she seem happy?

605
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,198
Yes. She did.

606
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,316
Is it really
so impossible to imagine?

607
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,914
What?

608
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,713
Couldn't it be that if someone
took care of you-

609
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,592
very good care of you-

610
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,711
if this person would do anything for you...

611
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,911
if your well-being was his only thought...

612
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,635
is it impossible that you might...

613
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,837
begin to feel something for him?

614
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,440
When there's true love,
it doesn't matter who it is.

615
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,918
Tell him I'll give him a month's pay.

616
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,557
And tell him it's disgusting.

617
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,556
Of course.

618
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,039
The capital
of the Philippines is Manila.

619
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,954
Its president is Ferdinand Marcos.

620
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,032
Its national language is Tagalog...

621
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,876
but many of its inhabitants speak Spanish
due to its colonial past.

622
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,555
And their national product is-

623
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,633
I don't know. Manila envelopes?

624
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,077
- You don't know anything.
- So?

625
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,595
How about this? All the boys are going
to think you're dumb.

626
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,399
Don't tell me how to get boys.

627
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,518
You went to second base twice.

628
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,592
That's a lot more than you.

629
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,639
- So if I were you, I'd be scared.
- Of what?

630
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,714
Of what you're going to do
when Mitchell asks you to go all the way.

631
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,598
He doesn't even know I'm alive.

632
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,353
Oh, I took care of that.

633
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,637
What did you do?

634
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,639
- I introduced you.
- I introduced myself.

635
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,310
No, I took the letter,
and I signed your name.

636
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,631
- What?
- And I slid it under the back door.

637
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,717
Ow! That really hurts.

638
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,951
How could you do that?
Now I can never go back.

639
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,713
You know you're going to thank me.

640
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,595
Just because your shift is over...

641
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,672
doesn't mean you can get
undressed in the lobby.

642
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,151
- Incredible.
- What?

643
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,914
He should greet you. How you doing today?

644
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,119
I'm- I got- I left something.

645
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,998
And I don't have my key.

646
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,560
You mean you lost it already?

647
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,030
Can I have the keys, please?

648
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,319
Yeah. Okay.

649
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,597
Go fast.

650
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,759
Oh, what have we got here?

651
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,672
Couple of high fashion models?

652
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,920
Oh, God.

653
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,960
- Sally.
- Oh, God.

654
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,834
Oh, dear God.

655
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,912
Dear God, what have we done?

656
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,276
Sally!

657
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,674
Sally!

658
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,439
Sally!

659
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,639
Did Sally just come through here?

660
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,359
Mr. Draper, I didn't know you was home.

661
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,397
She hopped in a cab just now.
I'll go get her.

662
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,519
You okay?

663
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,557
Yes.

664
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,194
Did something happen?

665
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,956
I know she lost her keys.
I gave her the keys. It's my fault.

666
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,673
Mr. Draper?

667
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,277
<i>Don't you ever work through channels?</i>

668
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,512
<i>- Who blew the whistle? Brent?
- Loud and clear.</i>

669
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,070
<i>Governor, I've tried to work with local
intelligence from the beginning.</i>

670
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,278
<i>Brent threw me out. Now, why?</i>

671
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,079
<i>Because it's big. That's why.</i>

672
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,800
<i>We've had big ones before,
but, this time, all I get is smoke.</i>

673
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,515
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

674
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,914
<i>McGarrett, this is an important state.</i>

675
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,560
<i>It's our nation's
extended finger into the Pacific-</i>

676
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,677
<i>the ocean where two-thirds-</i>

677
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,356
<i>two of the three billion persons
on earth meet and touch.</i>

678
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,994
Hello?

679
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,951
Oh, I'm glad you're home.

680
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,270
Let me get you a plate.

681
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,554
Oh, wow.

682
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,554
I had a client-
meeting. Lunch.

683
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,518
- Sit down.
- I'm, uh-

684
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,670
I'm gonna lie down.

685
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,150
You need to get some food in you.
Sit down.

686
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,633
Do you want me to cut you a piece?

687
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,076
No.

688
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,200
I got it.

689
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,155
Hello.

690
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,311
I'm sorry to bother you.

691
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,159
Don, Arnold and Mitchell are here.

692
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,035
- I don't feel well.
- Stop.

693
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,794
Hello, Mitchell.

694
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,475
I'm sorry to interrupt your dinner,
but we just got back...

695
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,392
and Mitchell has something
he wants to say.

696
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,074
Mr. Draper.

697
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,351
Thank you very much.

698
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,236
We'll see if it works.

699
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,356
What?

700
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,840
He didn't tell you?

701
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,552
Don talked to somebody for us.

702
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,313
Really?

703
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,596
Sylvia sends her gratitude.
She is overwhelmed.

704
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,715
Do you want something to eat?
We should celebrate.

705
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,473
One step at a time.

706
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,994
Anyway, Don...

707
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,518
I owe you.

708
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,960
Let's go.

709
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,832
No, you eat. I got it.

710
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,031
You are the sweetest man.

711
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,072
You make me sick!

712
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,076
Sally, come back here!

713
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,796
What happened?

714
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,439
I don't know.

715
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,116
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- No. I'll talk to her.

716
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,071
She has a crush on Mitchell.

717
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,435
Oh.

718
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,600
Sally.

719
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,757
- Open the door.
- No.

720
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,911
You don't get to talk to me anymore.

721
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,034
Sally?

722
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,192
Sally, open the door.
I need to talk to you.

723
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,951
I know you think you saw something.

724
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,397
I was... comforting Mrs. Rosen.

725
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,837
She was very upset.

726
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,039
It's very...

727
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,840
complicated.

728
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,638
Sally, can you hear me?

729
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,959
Yes.

730
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,832
Did you hear what I said?

731
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,915
Okay.
