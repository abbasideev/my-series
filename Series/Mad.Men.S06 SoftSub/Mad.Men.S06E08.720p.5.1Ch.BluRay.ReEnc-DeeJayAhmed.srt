1
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,316
Feel that torque?
It's like riding a hard-on.

2
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,110
Come on! Floor it!
My little girl's got a heavier foot.

3
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,714
I'm going back.

4
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,234
Knock it off, Mikey.

5
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,113
Go on the shoulder.
I want to shoot this sign.

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,317
Put the gun away,Jack!

7
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,479
Jesus, what the hell are you doing?

8
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,112
Arnie, you should eat something.

9
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,874
How about some leftover veal
and some cold pasta?

10
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,839
Want a beer, honey?

11
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,791
Chicken salad or tuna?

12
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,599
Here come the judge.

13
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,797
What's the difference? Eat it.

14
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,472
Who says we can't hire more people?

15
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,837
Why don't you take a nap?
Your face looks like a bag of walnuts.

16
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,638
Everyone should take a rest.
It's an easy thing to say, isn't it?

17
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,359
You're not thinking. You're not writing.

18
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,272
Ted, calm down. You need a nap too.

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,159
- Can you believe this crap?
- Yes, I can.

20
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,431
- Sorry I'm late.
- You're sorry you're late?

21
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,273
You couldn't call?

22
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,272
He called. I told you. There's no news.

23
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,760
You did not make that clear.

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,719
You really didn't.
You just said "no news."

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,031
You didn't say Kenny called in.

26
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,793
- Pow.
- Damn it.

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,792
No one cares that I almost got killed?

28
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,750
- What did they say?
- It's just like last time, no.

29
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,355
- What does that mean?
- It means they didn't like it.

30
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,229
Then they got drunk.
They took me for a joyride in the Impala.

31
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,471
Why can't we have the Impala?

32
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,074
What did they say?

33
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,039
They said they didn't like 'em.

34
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,237
It's your job to make them like them.

35
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,232
- Are you not up to the task?
- Don.

36
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,518
What? We've given
them seven ways to go in six weeks.

37
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,712
We don't even get to talk to them?
We have to depend on this cripple?

38
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,355
- You don't know what he's up against.
- I've got to sit down...

39
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,552
but I'm not gonna if you're just gonna
continue to insult me.

40
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,120
Just sit down.

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,669
They gave me this,
and I can't even show it to you.

42
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,797
What is it?
They typed up their rejection?

43
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,112
It's worse.
They finally gave me a calendar.

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,271
Three years of monthly deadlines.

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,511
That's the rest of'68, '69 and '70.

46
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,798
Best case scenario,
six months of strategy statements...

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,758
every one of them
backed up with copy tests.

48
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,599
And then, if and when
they land on something...

49
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,196
it's got to kick its way up the ladder
through all of GM until it gets to God.

50
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,112
And then he's got to run it past his wife.

51
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,714
So what happens now?

52
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,871
You take a swing at it,
and they take a swing at me.

53
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,156
They want another packet Tuesday morning.

54
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,039
- But they want me back on Sunday.
- For what?

55
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,759
I guarantee you
they're not going to church.

56
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,036
We cannot go on like this.

57
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,032
This is what Chevy is paying us for.

58
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,591
It's not our clock. It's theirs.
So what's another weekend?

59
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,637
Because they're really paying us.

60
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,440
Mr. Chaough, you have a phone call.

61
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,480
- Take a message.
- It's Nan. It's about that matter.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,593
Excuse me. Mr. Draper?

63
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,275
Get all the Chevy materials
back in my office.

64
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,955
- We're working the weekend.
- Yes, of course.

65
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,111
But I wanted to tell you
Dr. Rosen is on the phone.

66
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,434
- Do you want me to take a message?
- Yes.

67
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,678
- I'll find out what it's regarding.
- No.

68
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,672
I'll take it.

69
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,479
You know what, Don?
That's a great idea.

70
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,190
I'm gonna call my doctor.
I'm gonna get Kenny here fixed up.

71
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,516
I'm gonna get everybody fixed up.

72
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,198
- Arnold, how are you?
- It's me.

73
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,552
I'm glad to hear that.

74
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,438
Oh, I bet you are...

75
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,160
because I wanted to let you know
that's what that would feel like.

76
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,993
I thought I misunderstood.

77
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,560
Oh, bullshit.

78
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,911
You have got to stop
loitering in my hallway.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,832
Sylvia, I'm glad you called.

80
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,834
He saw all the cigarette butts out there,
and he thinks I'm smoking again.

81
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,434
I want to see you.

82
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,196
I was in the kitchen biting my nails
thinking, "I just cleaned it up."

83
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,277
How many nights are you out there?

84
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,238
I know you want to see me too.

85
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,993
All I kept thinking
is he's gonna come in...

86
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,878
and ask me why there's
no lipstick on them...

87
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,680
and I'm gonna burst into tears
and tell him everything.

88
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,150
Then he's gonna murder me and murder you.

89
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,800
- Are you afraid of him?
- No.

90
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,673
I'm afraid of you.

91
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,239
I don't think you understand.

92
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,238
Look, I'm too old
to say this was a mistake...

93
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,676
but I want you to try and be happy.

94
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,592
About what?

95
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,637
<i>That you got away with it.</i>

96
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,320
When you start something like this,
it takes a lot of convincing.

97
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,160
It's all about whether
or not the other person...

98
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,072
has as much to lose as you do...

99
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,039
because you want to be able
to trust them when it's over.

100
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,830
And right now I'm wondering
how I ever trusted you.

101
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,233
<i>I don't really have a choice, do I?
Because you've got me.</i>

102
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,030
So if you ever really cared
about me at all, knock it off.

103
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,192
Don't cry.Just listen to me.

104
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm feeling a lot of emotions too.

105
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,352
- I'm hanging up.
- Please, just listen.

106
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,754
I just want to talk to you
about a few things.

107
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,991
You loved Megan once.

108
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,152
- Stop it.
- Nothing else gets through to you.

109
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,918
I'm going.

110
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,075
Don't make me hang up on you.

111
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,831
I'm hanging up.

112
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,359
<i>Mr. Draper?</i>

113
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,159
<i>Mr. Draper.</i>

114
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,320
<i>I'm gonna go in there.</i>

115
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,995
- Yes?
<i>- Is everything okay?</i>

116
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,637
Yes, I'm fine.

117
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,280
I'm gonna-

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,117
I'm tired. I'm just gonna take a nap.

119
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,351
<i>You do that.</i>

120
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,998
You girls should back away.

121
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,874
Does he have a fever?

122
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,800
You get your bedroll.

123
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,872
You stay in here,
you'll get everybody sick.

124
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,636
- You sleep in the cellar.
- Yes, ma'am.

125
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,155
If the fever doesn't break,
we'll call a doctor.

126
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,959
Better for you than for everyone.

127
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,712
Aimée, did you leave
that plate in the lounge?

128
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,759
<i>Mr. Draper?</i>

129
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,434
Yes, what is it?

130
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,874
<i>Do you need some water?</i>

131
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,595
No, I'm fine.

132
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,993
Bobby, go get your suitcase.

133
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,993
- That's mine.
- What about Gene's?

134
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,873
I'm not going to pack his suitcase.

135
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,919
- I already did it. You just have to get it.
- Go get it, Geenie.

136
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,555
Go up there and get Pinocchio
and bring it down.

137
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,954
I have to do everything.

138
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,599
- Where's Daddy? We're ready to go.
- I'm taking you.

139
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,280
Were you sitting under the hair dryer
and just remembered that?

140
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,235
- Where did you get that skirt?
- I bought it.

141
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,039
You mean Megan bought it for you.

142
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,510
- I earned it.
- On what street corner?

143
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,432
She pays me to babysit.

144
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,989
You're not a hired hand.
You're their sister.

145
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,992
Boys, let's go.

146
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,311
I'm sorry to bother you,
but Mr. Cutler wants to see you.

147
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,278
It's been two and a half hours.
Do you want to rest some more?

148
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,158
No.

149
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,232
May I clean that up?

150
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,036
Please.

151
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,396
Put the Chevy materials
on the coffee table.

152
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,591
The funeral will be tomorrow.

153
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,990
Frank's family has asked
that in lieu of flowers...

154
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,869
a donation be made to
the American Cancer Society.

155
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,358
Frank Gleason was a great artist
and a great friend.

156
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,190
And he made our company whole.

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,037
I'm not gonna be able to work with you
through the weekend.

158
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,431
I apologize, but I'm afraid
this takes precedence.

159
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,274
I'll attend the funeral
if that's all right.

160
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,591
But I can still make myself
available for Chevy.

161
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,194
That's helpful.

162
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,033
I'm sorry for your loss.

163
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,919
He's a piece that cannot be replaced.

164
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,870
The doctor's here,
and I want you to see him.

165
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,032
- I don't know.
- No, he's gonna fix you up.

166
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,998
That's an order.

167
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,232
Can I see him too? I did it last time.

168
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,198
We're a team. If he does it, I do it.

169
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,112
Age before beauty.

170
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,312
How old was he?

171
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,119
Older than you, younger than me.

172
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,557
You either get used to it
or stop thinking about it.

173
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,359
Sorry about your friend.

174
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,477
Yeah, it's tragic.

175
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,472
I hope we don't lose Ted for too long.

176
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,791
He doesn't know
how to deal with these things.

177
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,798
- Do you feel anything? 'Cause I don't.
- He said it takes a minute.

178
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,917
- Well, maybe I need another.
- I'm next.

179
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,074
Actually, Roger,
I think Don should go next.

180
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,717
Pleasure to meet you. Dr. Hecht.

181
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,678
Don Draper. Where do you want me?

182
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,559
Anything in your medical history you
want to alert me to?

183
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,553
No. I'm just-

184
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,632
Hell, I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

185
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,837
You're exhausted.

186
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,555
Turn around and drop your pants.
This goes in the gluteus.

187
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,997
- What is it?
- It's an energy serum.

188
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,276
Oh? What's in it?

189
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,477
It's proprietary.
But all you need to know...

190
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,200
is it's a complex vitamin superdose.

191
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,876
It's basically my own combination
of"B" vitamins and a mild stimulant.

192
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,440
You have a heart condition?

193
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,836
No. I thought you said it was mild.
What does it do?

194
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,039
Well, a lot of things. But I think it'll
give you what Jim Cutler says you need-

195
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,149
24 to 72 hours of uninterrupted
creative focus, energy and confidence.

196
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,476
- Really?
- Really.

197
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,153
No one told you about this?

198
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,272
I've visited some agencies lately.

199
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,910
- You've got a great outfit here.
- Thank you.

200
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,560
All anybody wants to know
is what are you gonna call this place.

201
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,314
Can you tug your drawers
down a little?

202
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,394
"SCDPCGC"?

203
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,437
That's a mouthful.

204
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,356
Stan again.

205
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,957
What do you say, Don?
You think you can beat me?

206
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,556
I want another chance. You changed course.

207
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,112
- Who's next?
- That'd be me.

208
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,510
- And I have a heart condition.
- Don't worry about it.

209
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,590
Come on. Let's go. Best two out of three.

210
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,280
You can beat me any day.
Let me see the doctor first.

211
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,874
Hell, we'll do before and after.

212
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,716
Hey, kid. Where you going?

213
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,037
Come in here.

214
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,598
Sit down.

215
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,396
Breathe deep.

216
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,030
Is that you?

217
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,034
No.

218
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,840
It's a chest cold.
I've seen plenty of consumption.

219
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,400
You don't have it.

220
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,711
Lay down here.

221
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,519
Your mama don't know
how to take care of nobody.

222
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,432
She ain't my mother.

223
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,991
Can I help you?

224
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,117
- Do we know each other?
- I'd like to think so.

225
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,918
Can I help you?

226
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,636
I meant from somewhere
other than from this moment.

227
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,358
I don't think so.

228
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,677
- Where's Ed?
- He said his heart stopped.

229
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,400
- Roger took him to the hospital.
- But they were both laughing.

230
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,433
The strategy is about some kind
of love transaction...

231
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,113
between a parent and a child...

232
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,635
involving the greatest
gift of all, a Chevy.

233
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,952
I was a child, and she was a child
in this kingdom by the sea.

234
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,077
Four score and seven years ago...

235
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,834
this country had some
memorable happenings.

236
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,470
What I don't understand is...

237
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,396
is it "Dad, I want this car,"
or "Son, I bought you this car"?

238
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,712
Great, that's two.
We need 15 more and we can try another.

239
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,712
In what family is it
"Son, I bought you this car"?

240
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,876
- Good night, all.
- That guy's family.

241
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,270
Did you hear about Frank Gleason?

242
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,431
Yeah, I guess dreams do come true.

243
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,398
I think that's in poor taste.

244
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,790
Tell him, Peggy.
Tell him what a son of a bitch he was.

245
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,553
I liked him.

246
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,120
Before he was sick?

247
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,317
I hate how dying
makes saints out of people.

248
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,433
Well, he's obviously in a better place.

249
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,194
Have a good weekend.

250
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,198
"Dad, I need the car. I've got a date."

251
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,034
"Dad, everybody at school
has a car but me."

252
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,755
"Dad, I can only go to college
if I have a car."

253
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,957
- "Dad, I-"
- "Dad, I could be dying in Vietnam.

254
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,514
Don't you want me to have a car?"

255
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,432
Damn it, Ginsberg.
I had another 80 of them.

256
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,796
I got nothing interesting to say
'cause I'm not on drugs?

257
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,877
No, you just flushed a toilet in my head.

258
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,998
"Son, I got a car
when I was your age."

259
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,197
"Son, they didn't have cars
when I was your age."

260
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,671
"Son, you can fly till you're high
as an elephant's eye."

261
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,240
That's great.

262
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,073
What are you, class secretary?

263
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,197
I want to write stuff down
so it looks like I'm working.

264
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,237
Fine.

265
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,710
The child is the father of the man.

266
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,473
Spectacular.

267
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,276
<i>Mr. Draper.
Mr. Cosgrove is here to see you.</i>

268
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,073
Hello, Kenny. How you feeling?

269
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,516
My foot's like new.

270
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,273
You think you'll have new work
on Monday?

271
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,317
I'll have 15 campaigns for you by then...

272
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,471
but you have to get me in a room
so I can look them in the eye.

273
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,678
The timbre of my voice
is as important as the content.

274
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,956
I don't know whether
I'll be forceful or submissive...

275
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,633
but I must be there in the flesh.

276
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,916
You understand that I have
no power whatsoever?

277
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,231
That's not true. Not if they like you.

278
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,636
Oh, they like me all right.

279
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,190
- I'm their favorite toy.
- That's your job.

280
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,114
It's my job to take them to dinner
at 80 miles an hour.

281
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,795
It's my job to stop a mile
from the restaurant...

282
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,792
so they can have
five pounds of crab legs...

283
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,236
and three bottles of beer apiece
and then go get prime rib.

284
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,154
It's my job to go hunting
so they can fire off their guns...

285
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,678
an inch from my ear and laugh
when I get startled because it's my job.

286
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,314
Where'd you learn that?

287
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,155
My mother. No, my first girlfriend.

288
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,917
One doesn't like changing
so often, you know?

289
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,311
- I don't know.
- I'm not myself, you see?

290
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,834
I don't see.

291
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,752
And she comes to the fork in the road...

292
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,719
then she says to the Cheshire Cat,
"Which road do I take?"

293
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,837
I know this. Where do you want to go?

294
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,311
- I don't know.
- Then it doesn't matter, does it?

295
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,920
- How's it going?
- What's going on?

296
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,469
I know you're all feeling
the darkness here today.

297
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,631
But there's no reason to give in.

298
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,191
No matter what you've heard,
this process will not take years.

299
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,557
In my heart I know
we cannot be defeated...

300
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,155
because there is an answer
that will open the door.

301
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,796
There is a way around this system.

302
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,873
This is a test of our patience
and commitment.

303
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,597
One great idea can win someone over.

304
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,115
Dear Lord,
you're as good as they say.

305
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,878
That was very inspiring.
Do you have any idea what the idea is?

306
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,873
No. But I'm not gonna stop looking.

307
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,233
I think we should order dinner.

308
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,232
I don't think I'll ever eat again.

309
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,118
Do what you have to.

310
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,714
You're burning up.

311
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,076
You have to eat something.
Sit up.

312
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,516
I can't, Ms. Swenson.

313
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,910
Call me Aimée, and yes, you can.

314
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,120
I've got it.

315
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,152
I've got it.

316
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,476
How many times do you do it?

317
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,756
I need six throws for a reading.

318
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,151
- What are you doing?
- The I Ching.

319
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,315
Have you slept?

320
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,471
Crap. I missed the funeral, didn't I?

321
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,359
- How was it?
- It was rough.

322
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,433
- It was beautiful.
- Who are you?

323
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,156
Her name is Wendy. Wendy, this is Don.

324
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,117
Don. Ask a question.

325
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,351
- I'm supposed to be next.
- Are you done with mine?

326
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,797
You can just think of it.
You don't have to say it out loud.

327
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,514
Perfect.

328
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,316
Peggy, do you remember when we had soup?

329
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,959
Maybe.

330
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,679
Could you be more specific?

331
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,911
Carnegie Deli has great soup.

332
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,071
No, he's talking about some account.

333
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,231
He asked me yesterday.
I don't think it exists.

334
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,710
- No, I didn't.
- I don't understand what you're asking.

335
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,792
We had an account at Sterling Cooper.
A soup account.

336
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,673
That must have been before my time.

337
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,399
Can you go to the archives
and look for it?

338
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,551
I already looked.
Why are you asking her?

339
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,791
- 'Cause you think I'm incompetent?
- I did it!

340
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,520
I've got 666 ideas.

341
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,916
I'm wasting my Saturday with lunatics.

342
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,276
- It's Saturday?
- Yes, it is.

343
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,158
Why don't you lie down for a little while?

344
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,914
Because I've got it.
I want you to go to the archives.

345
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,199
Look in 1958 or '59 for soup.

346
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,120
You'll know it when you see it...

347
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,232
and it's gonna crack this thing wide open.

348
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,599
You see the mess you made?

349
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,911
That was fast.

350
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,959
What are you doing in here?

351
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,317
You said you were going to get some ice...

352
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,995
and we were going to have a drink
and watch the sun set.

353
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,117
I have some things to do.

354
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,439
Stop doing that.

355
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,719
You are really uptight, aren't you?

356
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,757
No, I'm just on a deadline.

357
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,119
- Where'd you get that?
- It was upstairs in one of the offices.

358
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,872
You want to get it on?

359
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,440
Wendy, what are you doing here?

360
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,876
I'm here to make you feel better.

361
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,397
I feel great, but I'm on a deadline.

362
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,280
"Does someone love me?"

363
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,079
What?

364
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,152
That's what your question was.

365
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,315
- Why would you say that?
- That's everyone's question.

366
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,914
I want to hear your heart.

367
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,392
I think it's broken.

368
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,119
You can hear that?

369
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,839
I can't hear anything.

370
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,560
I think it's broken.

371
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,118
You should go.

372
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,635
I'm in the middle of something.

373
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,875
<i>Good morning. Good morning.
Any complaints?</i>

374
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,749
Can you get that?
If it's Jeff Hunter, I'll be right there.

375
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,672
- Draper's.
- Sally?

376
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,992
- When are you coming home?
- Is Megan there?

377
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,879
- I want to talk to him.
- It's my dad.

378
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,193
Where are you?

379
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,873
I'm still at work.

380
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,595
I have to leave. I'm leaving right now.

381
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,912
I'm really sorry. I'm not finished yet.

382
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,880
It- I'm really close.
It's just the research hasn't come in.

383
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,919
Don, I don't care.
What am I supposed to do?

384
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,356
I watched them last night
so you could work and now-

385
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,193
I'll be home in a little bit.

386
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,352
Well, I don't like you working so hard.
You must be exhausted.

387
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,075
Actually, I've got a second wind.

388
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,680
When's he coming home?

389
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,719
Sally, how would you like to earn
some boots to go with that skirt?

390
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,395
You're going to leave us with her again?

391
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,949
I'm really sorry, sweetie,
but you know you'll have fun.

392
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,753
Don't make her feel bad.

393
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,117
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to see a play.

394
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,157
And Jeff, my agent, is going to
introduce me to some producers...

395
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,754
so that maybe I can be in their play.

396
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,678
Why do you want to do a play?

397
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,235
You're on TV every day.
Don't they know that?

398
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,039
Shit, you must be hungry.

399
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,873
Sally, would you put
a pot of water on the stove?

400
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,440
I'm gonna make spaghetti in a minute.

401
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,553
- I'm gonna wait for Dad.
- We're not hungry.

402
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,838
Okay, but go make Gene
a peanut butter and jelly.

403
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,994
Come on, that thing's twice
the size of a real apple. Step right up.

404
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,912
How about everybody takes one?

405
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,514
Do a real firing squad.

406
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,432
He's gonna look just like Saint Sebastian.

407
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,592
Hold on a second.
One at a time. Everybody'll get a chance.

408
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,195
You're pretentious,
you know that? I love that.

409
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,192
- I want to do it.
- Fine, but I'm gonna go first...

410
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,760
because you're drunk.

411
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,832
In fact, I believe I'm the only person...

412
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,872
in the Time-Life Building
who's not out of his mind.

413
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,872
But you hate him.

414
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,440
I hate apples more.

415
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,799
- Don't hit his eye.
- Don't hit anything.

416
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,470
- Crap.
- Who's next?

417
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,074
It's fine. It's fine.
I've done that before.

418
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,716
- Doesn't hurt at all.
- Let me see. Let me see.

419
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,838
- Keep pressure on it.
- Honestly, Peggy, I don't even feel it.

420
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,071
Come on. You've got to wash this.

421
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,030
Hold still.

422
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,476
You got a great bedside manner.

423
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,677
What are you doing?

424
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,273
You're lucky I don't like beards.

425
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,956
Women say that,
but they don't act like it.

426
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,793
You're like my brother.

427
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,395
You don't have a brother.

428
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,597
I want you to stop.

429
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,839
No, you don't.

430
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,956
I have a boyfriend.

431
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,954
No.

432
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,194
Come on.

433
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,680
I need this.

434
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,638
I know, I know. You're in pain.

435
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,711
My cousin Robbie was killed in action.

436
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,638
Twenty years old.

437
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,155
Had to join the fucking navy.

438
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,436
That's awful.

439
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,999
What happened?

440
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,314
They don't tell you.

441
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,551
They just tell you when it happened.

442
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,798
March 4. Three months ago.

443
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,470
That means my aunt sent 16 letters
that he never saw.

444
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,912
You know they get mail
right up to the front lines?

445
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,399
That'd be a bad job, right?

446
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,676
Delivering mail into combat?

447
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,592
I'm so, so sorry to hear that.

448
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,832
I've had loss in my life.

449
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,552
You have to let yourself feel it.

450
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,151
You can't dampen it with drugs and sex.

451
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,719
It won't get you through.

452
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,156
Maybe we're different.

453
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,872
Why don't you go home?

454
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,158
'Cause I can't stand up right now.

455
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,192
That's from the shot.

456
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,233
You've got a great ass.

457
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,878
Thank you.

458
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,390
Hello?

459
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,114
You startled me.

460
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,590
I didn't know anybody was home.

461
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,752
- What are you doing?
- Go back to sleep.

462
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,559
What are you doing here?

463
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,678
I'm visiting. Didn't nobody tell you?

464
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,594
No. Who are you?

465
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,115
I'm your grandma.

466
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,032
That's impossible.

467
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,032
Now, why is that impossible?

468
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,955
Okay, I know.

469
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,236
But I raised your daddy.

470
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,959
What are you doing here?

471
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,953
I was just looking for a serving plate.

472
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,157
I was gonna make your daddy's favorite.

473
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,790
You know, he loves fried chicken.
I bet you do too.

474
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,315
Ooh, you sure look like him.

475
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,039
No one said you were coming.

476
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,198
Well, I think I was supposed to be
a surprise for you.

477
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,399
And your daddy said I could visit,
and he gave me a key.

478
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,915
I thought nobody was home.

479
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,477
Come over here and give a hug
to your Grandma Ida.

480
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,478
Now, don't you be rude to me.

481
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,473
Is that how you was raised
to speak to your betters?

482
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,954
No.

483
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,477
I'm gonna fix you some eggs.

484
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,314
And you're gonna sit down
and you're gonna eat 'em.

485
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,155
But first, you're gonna tell me
who else in the house.

486
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,351
How come you don't know?

487
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,194
I haven't talked
to your daddy in a long time.

488
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,670
And he want to surprise me too.

489
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,513
I've never heard of you.

490
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,799
Your daddy
Mr. Donald Draper or not?

491
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,839
You come over here
and give me some sugar.

492
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,150
Now, I know you ain't
here all by yourself.

493
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,630
My little brothers are here.

494
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,916
Well, there's no need to wake them.

495
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,639
Just be us.

496
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,235
Okay, let's go and make you some eggs.

497
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,471
I bet you like them scrambled.

498
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,040
I can make them.

499
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,436
And burn yourself on the stove?

500
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,153
- When you think they're gonna be home?
- I don't know.

501
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,595
When's the last time you saw my dad?

502
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,956
Years ago.

503
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,430
I doubt he's changed.
He still handsome?

504
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,034
Yes.

505
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,793
Your mama still a piece of work?

506
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,519
Yes.

507
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,034
Now, what do they call you?

508
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,032
Sally.

509
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,394
Your fever broke.

510
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,632
- Yes, Ms. Swenson.
- Call me Amy.

511
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,713
It's not really Aimée.
I just liked the way it was spelled.

512
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,031
It's got two E's and an accent.

513
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,998
It's a nice name.

514
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,912
You <i>are</i> better.

515
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,273
- Do you like this?
- I do.

516
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,152
Do you like girls?

517
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,552
You don't even know what to do
right now, do you?

518
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,635
- But you like it.
- Stop it.

519
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,472
You like my bosom.

520
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,119
I don't know.

521
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,640
Don't you want to know
what all the fuss is about?

522
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,234
No.

523
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,310
It's okay. I'll do everything.

524
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,836
- What are you looking for?
- Now you stop asking questions...

525
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,833
or I'm not gonna let you eat
in your nice living room.

526
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,559
Maybe I know where it is.

527
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:59,193
I'm just looking for some place
to hide my presents I bought y'all.

528
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,835
My, that TV's in here good!

529
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,479
Who's she?

530
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,313
Is that little Bobby?

531
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,040
My, you have grown up big!

532
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,635
- Who are you?
- That's Grandma Ida.

533
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,234
We don't have a grandma.

534
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,039
You do now.

535
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,874
And you gonna get
all the candy and toys...

536
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,952
and good stuff your grandma bought you...

537
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,520
when you wake up in the morning.

538
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,360
But right now, you go back to sleep.

539
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,999
I'm not tired.

540
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,356
Now, Sally don't remember...

541
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,473
but I gave your daddy a watch...

542
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,472
gold watch.

543
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,358
And I got a new band for it...

544
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,716
and I wanna fix it up before he come back.

545
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,473
You seen it?

546
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,279
He has four watches.

547
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,670
I'll know it when I see it.

548
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,274
They're in the drawer by his bed.

549
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,231
Are we allowed to watch TV?

550
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,879
I think she's lying.

551
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,713
Are we Negroes?

552
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,311
Hello. Will you put me
through to the police? It's an emergency.

553
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,917
I'm at 783 Park Avenue,
and there's a stranger in our apartment.

554
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,480
What?

555
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,159
No, I'm 14.

556
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,755
My name is Sally Draper.

557
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,513
Hello?

558
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,759
Yes, sir.

559
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,797
These children ought to be in bed...

560
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,758
and they ain't too well behaved.

561
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,517
Yes, sir.
They played a joke on both of us.

562
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,796
Uh-huh.

563
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,792
Good night.

564
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,753
Now, why'd you do something like that?

565
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,878
You hurt my feelings.

566
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,520
I'm gonna go out and get some air.

567
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,753
When I come back, you best be sleeping.

568
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,117
"This may be hard to believe,
but the history can't be ignored.

569
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,079
The history should not be ignored.

570
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,800
Look, I don't want to waste
your time, with-"

571
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,233
Peggy!

572
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,476
"I don't want you to shut this door.

573
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,918
Just let me say a few things.
You and I both know-"

574
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,839
- Did you want us?
- Yes. Get everyone.

575
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,713
No, wait.

576
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,280
Just listen. I've got it.

577
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,397
Great.

578
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,353
Remember this work?

579
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,113
I've never seen it before.

580
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,954
Well, it says it all. It really does.

581
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,114
Okay, I've got this great message...

582
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,398
and it has to do with
what holds people together.

583
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,837
What is that thing that draws them?
It's a history.

584
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,510
And it may not even be
with that person, but it's-

585
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,036
it's like a-

586
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,640
well, it's bigger than that.

587
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,712
And that makes them buy a car?

588
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,510
If this strategy is successful,
it's way bigger than a car.

589
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,114
It's everything.

590
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,678
I keep thinking about
the basic principle of advertising.

591
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,359
There's entertainment
and you stick the ad...

592
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,193
in the middle of the entertainment
like a little respite.

593
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,794
It's a bargain.

594
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,314
They're getting
the entertainment for free.

595
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,914
All they have to do
is listen to the message.

596
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,390
But what if they don't
take the bargain at all?

597
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,233
What if they're suddenly
bored of the entertainment?

598
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,357
What if they don't-
What if they turn off the TV?

599
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,676
- You gotta get your foot in the door.
- Exactly!

600
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,150
So, how do I do that?

601
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,711
Let's say I get her face-to-face.
How do I capture her imagination?

602
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,712
I have a sentence, maybe two.

603
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,678
Who's "her"?

604
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,071
Promise them everything.
You know, you're gonna change their life.

605
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,277
- You're gonna take away their pain.
- That's good.

606
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,113
Then you hit 'em with the one-two punch.

607
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,034
What's the answer
to all of life's problems? A Chevy.

608
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,431
- No, it's not.
- Then it's oatmeal?

609
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,398
No.

610
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,598
What have you been doing
the last three days?

611
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,030
Have you been working on Chevy at all?

612
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,918
I gotta go.

613
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,390
You wanna get someone in here
who can draw?

614
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,073
No, I don't have time for art.

615
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,152
He's happy. Now we can relax.

616
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,911
You think he'll care if I nap in here?

617
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,071
Don? Wait.

618
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,678
I'm going home!

619
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,079
Okay, I'm gonna change my shirt...

620
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,277
tell Megan I'm going out for cigarettes...

621
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,079
then I'm gonna knock on her door.

622
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,590
Sylvia, don't close the door on me.

623
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,435
"When in the course of human events-" No.

624
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,354
"You haven't heard
everything I have to say."

625
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,193
Don't shut the door on me.

626
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,990
All right, all right, he's home.

627
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,037
Oh, thank God you're here.

628
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,113
What's going on?

629
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,919
I'll tell you what's going on.

630
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,471
Some elderly Negro woman held your
children hostage and robbed you blind.

631
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,990
- What?
- Betty.

632
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,720
She robbed a bunch of places
in the building, and she came in here.

633
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,200
Our back door was open.

634
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,558
She said she was your mother.

635
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,036
We think we caught her boarding the I.R.T.

636
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,999
You'll need to come down
in the next 24 hours and I.D. your things.

637
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,037
Because no one was here.

638
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,550
Because she's off
on the casting couch and you're-

639
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,359
What does he tell everybody?
That he's at work?

640
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,194
This is not the time or the place
for this conversation.

641
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,431
Ma'am, this could have happened to anyone.

642
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,239
Anyone who lives
in this disgusting city...

643
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,073
and leaves their three children alone.

644
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,277
Do you know Henry's running for office?

645
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,918
Sally, I'm really sorry.
I should have been home earlier.

646
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,400
I want to go home.

647
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,354
You get your hands off me!
I don't need to be manhandled!

648
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,756
- I know you've been holding out on me.
- You don't know anything.

649
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,639
- I defy your accusations.
- You peddle that ass on the street.

650
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,677
You don't deserve a home.
You don't deserve me.

651
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,274
Yeah? I do fine without you.

652
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,794
And you owe me money,
not the other way around.

653
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,190
- Get out.
- 'Cause I took that boy's cherry.

654
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,634
$5.00, we'll call it even.

655
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,314
- Is that true?
- No.

656
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,840
You filthy, shameful,
disgusting, shameful, horrible-

657
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,559
You're trash!

658
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,792
You are filth! You know that you are!

659
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,395
After I gave you a home...

660
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,279
you go and do something this disgraceful!

661
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,996
I know you're exhausted,
but I could feel the floor swimming too...

662
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,719
when I came home to that.

663
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,837
I'm surprised we didn't all faint.

664
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,833
I'm really sorry.

665
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,875
Sally seems so grown up,
but she's really still a kid.

666
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,590
- How are you?
- Busy.

667
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,079
You should talk to him.

668
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,840
Hello?

669
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,151
I just wanted to call
and tell you I'm okay.

670
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,118
I didn't have a heart attack.

671
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,600
I've just been working too much.

672
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,399
I'm- I'm so embarrassed.

673
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,517
I acted like a stupid little kid.

674
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,671
No, you didn't.

675
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,717
And I'm sure she's fooled
plenty of adults too.

676
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,757
She said she knew you.

677
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,399
I asked her everything I know...

678
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,678
and she had an answer for everything.

679
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,992
Then I realized I don't know
anything about you.

680
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,272
<i>Mr. Chaough wants to see you.</i>

681
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,435
You did everything right.
Try and forget about it.

682
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,159
Okay.

683
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,232
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Sally.

684
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,954
I left the door open.
It was my fault.

685
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,316
Okay. Bye.

686
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,076
I need to talk to you.

687
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,799
Morning, fellas.

688
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,716
I'm fine. Thank you for asking.

689
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,513
How could you bring
Frank's little girl here?

690
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,638
I let her tag along.
I kept an eye on her, didn't I, Don?

691
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,400
- Who?
- Wendy.

692
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,915
Believe me, it's a lot better than
what could have happened...

693
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,798
if I had let her loose
in the Village like she wanted.

694
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,076
Well, that's not what her mother thinks.

695
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,799
What the hell went on here this weekend?

696
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,793
Half of this work is gibberish.
"Chevy" is spelled wrong.

697
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,840
Look, I am going to continue on Chevy
in my function as creative director.

698
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,991
That is, evaluating other people's work.

699
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,673
That's all I can do right now.

700
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,317
Call me around 1970
when they're ready to make an ad.

701
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,869
What are you talking about?
I can't do this by myself.

702
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,599
I'm sorry, Ted.

703
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,036
But every time we get a car
this place turns into a whorehouse.
