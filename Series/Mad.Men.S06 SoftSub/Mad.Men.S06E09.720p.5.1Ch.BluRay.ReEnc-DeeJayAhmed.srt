1
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,153
It tastes better
because it's more expensive.

2
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,357
It's the premium brand
and it's priced accordingly.

3
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,757
Price is irrelevant because the question is,
does it taste better than butter?

4
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,757
Butter is actually fresh.
Margarine is indestructible.

5
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,719
He's right because he's only comparing
different margarines...

6
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,679
and margarine
has a 70% market share over butter.

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,835
But it's hard to say
any brand is luxury...

8
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,832
when although Fleischmann's
is the most expensive...

9
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,674
and Blue Bonnet, owned by the same
company, is the least expensive...

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,240
the difference is only pennies.

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,711
Forty-five cents a pound is the highest.
Twenty-nine is the lowest.

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,672
That's 50% more expensive.

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,280
Fleischmann's is Chivas Regal.

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,194
Still half the price of butter.
It's Budweiser.

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,509
But what's the market share?

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,233
I just said it's much higher than butter.

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,232
Seeing as I have the ear of the client...

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,677
it's my recommendation
we go on taste alone.

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,549
Peggy!

20
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,797
Don, I agree with you.

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,839
You're in the market buying margarine.

22
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,910
Okay.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,639
What goes through your mind?

24
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,718
Mouthwatering, savory, delicious taste?

25
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,874
Or mouthwatering, savory,
delicious taste and price?

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,434
I'd buy the cheaper one.

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,433
There's one for 45 cents a pound
and one for 29.

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,910
Which one do you think
is gonna taste better?

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,072
It's a terrible gamble to tell a client
that their product is expensive.

30
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,879
Shh. Let her answer.

31
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,638
I don't know.

32
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,154
They both sound good.

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,515
Really?

34
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,193
Does everyone agree with yours?

35
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,118
It's not his and mine.
Everyone has an opinion.

36
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,680
We haven't heard it, but I'm sure they do.

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,035
I like Don's.

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,873
What did Harry say?

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,112
I feel strongly both ways.

40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,519
They're both so good.

41
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,513
I'd probably ask someone to run them
by the client on the sly.

42
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,193
The meeting's tomorrow.

43
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,432
You know what, Don? Let's go with yours.

44
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,070
Nah, I'm not even gonna be there.

45
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,554
You should go with
whatever you're most comfortable with.

46
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,319
Could you get me another
copy of that research?

47
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,039
I want to make it big on a board.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,959
Did you see that?
He didn't even turn around.

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,231
- Yep.
- Oh, it speaks.

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,472
I wasn't gonna get in the middle of that.
You suddenly dumber than Peggy?

51
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,631
So you're content in silence?

52
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,473
I'm content with reality.

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,358
You know what this place looks like
to the outside world?

54
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,477
A mess.
We don't even have a name.

55
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,155
- We're the '27 Yankees.
- Says who?

56
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,039
Pete, you want to get your balls tickled?

57
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,634
Go see a headhunter.

58
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,393
Are you leaving?

59
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,836
Look, when things settle down,
I'm gonna be a partner.

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,913
For the time being, it's nice to know that
the water's warm out there.

61
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,952
Did you lose something?

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,436
Yes.

63
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,034
I was looking for-

64
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,793
How do you say? A pen
to write something down.

65
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,874
Oh. Well, the desk is littered with them.

66
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,918
Would you like a drink?

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,798
Certainly, Colette.

68
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,078
Although this is my husband's office.
I should be offering you one.

69
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,756
- It is no trouble at all.
- We're a lot alike.

70
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,674
We're both interested
in things that belong to me.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,151
I don't know what you're talking about.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,119
I don't know what your relationship
is with my husband, but it's over.

73
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,800
Cut. Let's clean up in there and back up.

74
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,117
Megan, sweetheart,
what are you doing on the floor?

75
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,157
The script said to spill the drink.

76
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,993
It doesn't say to clean it up.

77
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,753
I just thought-

78
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,599
Your sister Corinne is the maid.

79
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,957
You're Colette right now.
She's blonde, classy.

80
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,078
We need you to make
these women different, honey.

81
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,516
Let's take it from the top, ladies.

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,359
Don't worry about it.

83
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,193
I think Phyllis left for the day, but I
never saw the boards for tomorrow.

84
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,600
Stan has them.

85
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,675
- What are you working on?
- Royal Hawaiian.

86
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,594
- How's that going?
- I'm sure you will tell me.

87
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,637
I will.

88
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,313
I'll look at it very carefully...

89
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,517
and then I'll formulate
an educated opinion.

90
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,676
You should try it sometime.
It's what professionals do.

91
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,756
Don.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,674
Been debating that for weeks.
You both have a point.

93
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,553
I'm not paying you to be a diplomat.

94
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,518
Well, you're both
more experienced than me.

95
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,319
I don't know that my opinion matters.

96
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,916
Your opinion matters. Now, what do you
think is the best way to go?

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,912
- It's somewhere in the middle.
- No, Peggy.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,037
There's a right and there's a wrong.

99
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,839
How could that be?

100
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,674
What you're really saying is
there's you and there's him.

101
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,753
And I don't know how I became in charge of
turning this into a collaboration.

102
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,957
Isn't that your job?

103
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,997
You're both demanding
and you're both pigheaded.

104
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,117
You're the same person sometimes.

105
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,317
The difference is that
he's interested in the idea...

106
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,153
and you're interested in <i>your</i> idea.

107
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,080
He's interested in his idea.
Don't let him fool you.

108
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,595
Well, he never makes me feel this way.

109
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,074
He doesn't know you.

110
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,117
Henry said you were leaving.

111
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,111
He just had to make one phone call,
which turned out to be two.

112
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,796
- Full house, I see.
- He should be off in a minute.

113
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,712
Well, he's a lucky man,
but not as lucky as me...

114
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,473
because I wanted to be
alone with you all night.

115
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,640
He'll be out in a minute.

116
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,434
I don't think you heard.

117
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,996
I want to be alone with <i>you</i> all night.

118
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,153
Mr. Dell, I have three children.

119
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,674
I don't care.

120
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,759
No, look at me.

121
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,352
Can you believe I've had three children?

122
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,237
How was your evening, Stew?

123
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,999
Raised a lot of money.

124
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,719
Darling, shall we?

125
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,555
- What's going on?
- There was an incident.

126
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,113
Oh, my God!

127
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,669
- They hurt you.
- I'm fine, honey.

128
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,878
He was getting off the subway
and two guys stabbed him.

129
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,316
- What?
- Hey, I don't want to worry her, man.

130
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,232
I'm sorry, but I'm trying
to get it straight.

131
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,798
And, frankly, she should know
so she can keep up her defense.

132
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,951
- Jesus! What happened?
- Are we done here?

133
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,795
For a reporter, this is missing detail.

134
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,113
And if you'd waited at the hospital,
as you were instructed, we'd be done.

135
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,192
But for some reason you didn't.

136
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,593
I filled out the form.

137
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,320
Come on. Were they colored
or Puerto Rican?

138
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,834
Or white?

139
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,435
I'm from Brooklyn
and I always keep my eyes down.

140
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,876
Could you describe the shoes?

141
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,794
Look, both of us have done our civic duty.

142
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,270
So, respectfully, I think you should go.

143
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,999
I'd get one of these.

144
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,914
Good evening, ma'am.

145
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,437
Can you believe those questions?
Fascist pig!

146
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,153
Shut up, Abe!

147
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,119
You don't know what they look like?
You have a photographic memory.

148
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,793
Peg, I'm not gonna give him an excuse...

149
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,553
to shake down every kid
that walks through this neighborhood.

150
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,393
What about the one that stabbed you?

151
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,632
This is a fucking police state,
and we're gonna have to fight, okay?

152
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,200
They did it in Prague.
They did it in Paris.

153
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,272
And, believe it or not,
we're gonna have to do it here too.

154
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,397
That doesn't mean protecting criminals.

155
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,473
Listen, baby, it's my right to tell
whomever whatever I want.

156
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,472
But you can keep talking because
everything you say is going in my story.

157
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,040
What are you talking about?

158
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,238
It's just fascinating,
the attitudes I'm encountering.

159
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,437
But why would you side with the cops?

160
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,634
I don't know.

161
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,632
I read about this.

162
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:11,319
You obviously had a traumatic experience,
not unlike combat.

163
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,997
So I'm going to let you do
whatever you're doing.

164
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,753
Don't patronize me.

165
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,160
Those kids have no other
recourse in this system.

166
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,436
- They're animals.
- They were brought here by slave ships.

167
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,273
Well, I was brought here by you.

168
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,636
I don't care if I take a loss.
I'm gonna sell this shithole.

169
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,350
You're worried about me
and I love you for it.

170
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,395
I don't think I can type with this thing.
Get my Olympia.

171
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,834
Help me get some of this down.

172
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,320
I'm going to bed.

173
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,513
This is nice.

174
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,760
It's Thursday.
Told you I was making dinner.

175
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,514
Sit down.

176
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,359
How was your day?

177
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,680
How was yours?

178
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,433
It was-
Ugh, it was terrible.

179
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,152
I don't even know
if I want to talk about it.

180
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,872
What's for dinner?

181
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,476
- I think they hate me.
- They just gave you a second part.

182
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,677
I feel like an idiot because they keep
telling me they can't tell the twins apart.

183
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,829
I think I'm playing them very differently.

184
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,752
It's not like it's never been done before.

185
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,354
Exactly.

186
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,840
I told Mel I didn't want to be a cliché.

187
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,199
Then he starts rapping about how they're
two halves of the same person...

188
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,876
and they want the same thing, but they're
trying to get it in different ways.

189
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,551
Listen, would you mind
if we just go in and turn on the set?

190
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,074
I'm really not hungry.

191
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,072
Did you have a bad day?

192
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,594
I'm just tired.

193
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,440
Go lie down. I'll clean up.

194
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,515
I already packed your bag
for Bobby's camp.

195
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,759
Tomorrow's another day.

196
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,680
John, could you give us some privacy?

197
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,875
- Was the evening a success?
- You tell me.

198
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,952
Well, I, um-

199
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,192
I found it fascinating, as usual,
watching you work your magic.

200
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,317
And while you were watching me...

201
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,638
everyone was watching you,
weren't they?

202
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,320
Stewart did everything but grab your ass.

203
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,073
I didn't notice.

204
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,640
What did he say to you?

205
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,277
I don't want to get anyone in trouble.

206
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,992
Word for word.

207
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,355
He said he wanted to be alone with me.

208
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,040
What else?

209
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,840
All night.

210
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,316
Daddy, I don't want him
running on the steps.

211
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,278
Why not? Kids are supposed to run.

212
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,840
Ellery, come down.

213
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,078
We don't have any steps in the apartment.
He's not good at them.

214
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,273
So what do you think, girls?

215
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,914
See any resemblance?

216
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,957
He's very handsome.

217
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,397
So, Ellery, take a good look.
Who's your type?

218
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,833
Hello, Margaret.

219
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,559
I'll tell you mine later.

220
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,472
It's nice to see you.

221
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,280
Oh, he's precious. How old is he?

222
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,757
He's four.
He's having a special day with Pop-pop.

223
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,832
We're going to the zoo
and maybe the movies.

224
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,559
So it's just a regular workday.

225
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,072
Don't fill him full of junk.

226
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,680
Can't promise that.

227
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,398
Wave good-bye, swabby.
We're shoving off.

228
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,833
How many times have you met with Harry?

229
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,480
Too many.
Don't waste my time like Crane.

230
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,711
I'm a headhunter, not a fan club.

231
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,440
Fine. Let's talk about me.

232
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,512
Let's talk about Burt Peterson.

233
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,757
I got him a vice presidency
at McCann.

234
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,797
If he keeps his head down,
he's set for life.

235
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,757
But the merger was fresh.

236
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,958
I don't know your situation.
You weren't very straight on the phone.

237
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,633
You think they're gonna cut you loose?

238
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,558
How come you didn't get yourself a job?

239
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,319
That's a Yankee wrinkle.
You interested in my business?

240
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,834
No.

241
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,914
Well, if we sat down
a couple of months ago...

242
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,872
this would have been
a different conversation.

243
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,798
Nothing's changed.
I'll show you my Rolodex.

244
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,152
It's not that. It's your lack of a role
in the management structure.

245
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,358
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce
Cutler Gleason and Chaough?

246
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,840
Who the hell's in charge?

247
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,877
Two of those men are as dead as doornails.

248
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,350
There's still a lot of chiefs
and only a couple of Indians.

249
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,397
And a lot of questions.

250
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,233
What the hell happened with Vicks?

251
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,996
So... paint me a new portrait.

252
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,200
I'm glad you said that.

253
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,872
How about seeing things
from the client's side?

254
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,839
There's a head of marketing job
in Wichita that you'd be perfect for.

255
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,479
Anything back here on Earth?

256
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,994
You know,
I've always liked you, Campbell...

257
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,759
so forgive me for saying this...

258
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,150
but if you do a little better,
I can do a lot better.

259
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,473
I don't know what else I can do.

260
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,680
I've been you.

261
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,437
And I went on interviews and I realized
I was filling the room with desperation.

262
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,673
Five cents worth of free advice.

263
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,752
You've got to spend
less time in this place and more at home.

264
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,071
This is a reluctant necessity.

265
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,719
My mother's run amok.

266
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,357
Pete, one day I looked in the mirror
and I realized I had regrets...

267
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,353
because I didn't understand
the wellspring of my confidence.

268
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,590
Gin?

269
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,512
My family.

270
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,471
My family is a constant distraction.

271
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,031
You better manage that
or you're not gonna manage anything.

272
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,960
Hey, buddy.

273
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,153
Can you help me?

274
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,709
Uh, I'm occupied at the moment, sir.

275
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,709
Hello there.

276
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,392
Oh. Are you lost too?

277
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,830
Not yet. I'm trying to get some gas.

278
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,913
Lady asked for directions.

279
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,798
Fill 'er up with regular.

280
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,874
Where's Henry?

281
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,440
He's coming tomorrow.

282
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,597
I'm surprised you were able to get away.

283
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,594
Where are you staying?

284
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,673
Somewhere over here.

285
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,400
Just go down here.

286
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,837
Stay on here a mile and a half till you
get to the big mill. Make a left.

287
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,071
Go back through town
till the railroad tracks.

288
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,198
Hang a right over the bridge
and then you come to the little mill.

289
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,713
Do any of the roads have names?

290
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,274
Follow me.

291
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,075
Fleischmann's just called.

292
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,629
See? You were worried for nothing.

293
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,713
Well, they just requested
some more recent figures on market share.

294
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,314
I'll handle it.

295
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,357
Peggy, may I speak with you?
Go ahead.

296
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,912
What the hell were you doing back there?

297
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,878
You didn't want me to talk.

298
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,634
I didn't talk. That was the plan.
Did you want me to talk?

299
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,280
- No. You touched my hand.
- What?

300
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,192
When you handed me the board.

301
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,634
What? No, I didn't.

302
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,952
Yes, you did.
And you can't do that in a presentation.

303
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,600
I doubt anyone saw that
because I didn't even know I did it.

304
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,878
It jarred me. And when I finally
caught up, then you smiled.

305
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,236
You can't smile at me like that.

306
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,515
I never should have kissed you.

307
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,150
I assumed we were forgetting about that.

308
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,040
I forgot it.

309
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,839
Well, I haven't.

310
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,075
Oh.

311
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,194
What an old tune.

312
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,157
The boss in love with his protégé.

313
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,074
Is this all me? Because that'll help.

314
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,993
I think about it.

315
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,675
Well, we can't.
I have someone, you have someone.

316
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,520
And believe me, I've considered it
a lot further than that.

317
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,838
I didn't know you felt this way.

318
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,310
I don't want to. That's the point.

319
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,710
Now I realize I never should
have brought it up.

320
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,791
Do you want me to work someplace else?

321
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,873
No. Of course not.

322
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,439
Come on. You have to do it.

323
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,558
And the left.

324
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,314
<i>Father Abraham
had seven sons</i>

325
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,436
<i>Seven sons</i>

326
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,752
<i>And seven sons
had Father Abraham</i>

327
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,797
Daddy, you came!

328
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,320
You didn't tell him I was here?

329
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,756
I wanted it to be a surprise.

330
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,672
You catch any fish?

331
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,514
Damn it. I made you a wallet,
but it's back in my cabin.

332
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,829
Bobby, language.

333
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,479
We'll get it later.

334
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,950
Mommy said we can have anything we want.

335
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,354
Hi!

336
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,113
This is my mom and dad.

337
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,276
That's Bobby Two. He's shy.

338
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,829
Are you Bobby or Bobby One?

339
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,513
I'm Bobby Five.

340
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,557
It's sad. There's no Bobby One anymore.

341
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,359
Because of Bobby Kennedy?

342
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,352
No. He went home.

343
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,000
Do you want me to get the waitress
so you can get a drink?

344
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,076
- Is that possible?
- No.

345
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,232
Mommy's having a chef salad
and I'm having a cheeseburger.

346
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,993
What do you want so I can order?

347
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,434
- What's good here?
- I'm afraid nothing.

348
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,955
Daddy, I want to teach you this song.

349
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,554
Just do what I do.

350
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,873
<i>Father Abraham had
seven sons, seven sons</i>

351
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,476
<i>And seven sons
had Father Abraham</i>

352
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,711
<i>And they never
laughed, ha ha</i>

353
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,678
<i>And they never cried,
boo-hoo</i>

354
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,434
<i>All they did was go like this</i>

355
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,000
<i>With the right</i>

356
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,039
<i>Father Abraham
had seven sons</i>

357
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,270
<i>Seven sons</i>

358
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,751
<i>Seven sons
had Father Abraham</i>

359
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,797
<i>And they never
laughed, ha ha</i>

360
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,633
<i>And they never cried,
boo-hoo</i>

361
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,111
<i>All they did was go like this,
with the right</i>

362
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,679
Can I walk you out?

363
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,832
Certainly, if you don't mind waiting.

364
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,837
I need your advice.

365
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,551
And, well, it's of a personal nature,
and thus above Clara's security clearance.

366
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,154
How can I help you?

367
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,399
Do you feel my attention to business
has been dilute?

368
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,597
How personal is this conversation?

369
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,472
I'm being pulled in a million directions.

370
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,553
My wife, my child, my mother.

371
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,552
I can't solve those problems, Pete.

372
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,359
I have those problems.

373
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,999
I live with my mother.

374
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,436
Has your mother exhausted
every nursing agency?

375
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,671
No, but she's exhausted me.

376
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,757
Well, the options are my home and a home...

377
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,832
neither of which will make me feel better.

378
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,389
I am sorry to hear that.

379
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,554
- Do you want to get supper?
- I can't. I have plans.

380
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,714
Thank you, Joan.

381
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,120
For what?

382
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,553
I don't know.

383
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,672
Welcome.

384
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,672
Oh, I'm a little damp.

385
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,320
- Did it finally rain?
- No, but I walked.

386
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,153
This was cold when I left.

387
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,272
You walked from the West Side?

388
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,354
What an incredible space.

389
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,920
Did you do this yourself?

390
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,111
Oh, I had a little help.

391
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,671
Arlene, you read about
the shootings in the park, didn't you?

392
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,595
I'm not gonna let a few lunatics
ruin a gorgeous night like this.

393
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,239
Should I go get my script?

394
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,277
Megan, darling...

395
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,875
you're a good actress,
on your way to becoming, well...

396
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,758
at least a successful one.

397
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,036
There's nothing I can tell you
about that script.

398
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,998
I came over here because
I'm worried about you.

399
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,117
Am I gonna get fired?

400
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,317
I remember my first job.

401
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,914
Believe it or not, in radio.

402
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,753
<i>Against the Storm.</i>

403
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,993
Very classy,
a lot of big words, high morals.

404
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,233
And my agent, who I later learned
was angling to sign Roger DeKoven...

405
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,357
told me my voice was childish.

406
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,272
And every day I would vacillate between...

407
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,829
"Arlene, you're wonderful"
and "Arlene, you're caca."

408
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,439
Which was it?

409
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,914
Honestly?

410
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,514
I was wonderful.

411
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,957
You should go inside.
You'll get eaten alive out here.

412
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,350
You know mosquitoes ignore me.

413
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,999
In those shorts?

414
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,600
Did you find a bottle?

415
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,195
Maybe.

416
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,840
Cheers.

417
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,638
I loved camp.

418
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,959
I never went.

419
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,999
Yes, you did.

420
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,393
Remember when we went
to Lake Champlain with my parents?

421
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,560
I remember.

422
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,071
And you got in a horrible fight with my father
about who would carry the luggage.

423
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,150
And then we went in the woods
and made Sally.

424
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,992
I don't understand her.

425
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,033
Henry says she's a lot like you.

426
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,994
How would he know?

427
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,276
He says she reminds him of you.

428
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,113
I think she's a lot like you.

429
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,796
Bobby reminds me of my father.

430
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,553
So bossy.

431
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,594
All the teenagers
of the world are in revolt.

432
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,593
What were we like?

433
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,918
You and me?

434
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,078
When I saw you earlier today,
I thought for a second...

435
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,753
"Who is that man?"

436
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,636
And I forgot how mad I was at you.

437
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,640
I don't know what's happened,
but I'm all bit up.

438
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,632
Close the door. You'll let the bugs in.

439
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,078
What are you doing?

440
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,470
Waiting for you to tell me to stop.

441
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,398
What did you think when you saw me?

442
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,274
That you are as beautiful
as the day I met you.

443
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,837
So finally I said to Mel...

444
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,197
"I'm either his mother or his girlfriend.
I can't be both."

445
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,839
That's bad writing.

446
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,151
You're so lucky he's at work.

447
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,233
Please, dear.
That's a complex relationship.

448
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,516
But he understands what you do...

449
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,319
and he wants you to be great.

450
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,596
And he's always proud of you.
I've seen it.

451
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,235
Don's very proud of you.

452
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,915
You can tell by how protective he is.

453
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,754
It's been so different.

454
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,074
You know, we worked together
and I left to pursue this.

455
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,117
And he was so encouraging.

456
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,874
And then you started succeeding.

457
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,476
He's old-fashioned.
He'll get used to it.

458
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,200
I think he did.

459
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,830
And I think he got used
to me not being around...

460
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,277
and having a bunch of problems
that he couldn't solve.

461
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,397
And I don't know...

462
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,711
if it's him or me, but...

463
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,193
I feel so lonely.

464
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,680
Arlene.

465
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,878
What? I want to make you feel better.

466
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,792
This isn't the way.

467
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,398
Oh, forget it.

468
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,517
I can't believe you.

469
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,150
I'm trusting you and you're taking
advantage of every private moment.

470
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,391
Well, what was I supposed to think?

471
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,878
You invited me over.

472
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,434
Your husband's not here.

473
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,877
Two bottles of wine to go over a scene
a child could understand.

474
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,440
"I'm so lonely."

475
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,989
I work with you
and your husband is my boss.

476
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,799
And now what am I supposed to do?

477
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,076
Am I gonna be punished
for not doing something...

478
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,231
that you won't stop trying to do?

479
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,030
Megan, it's okay to say no,
but you don't have to embarrass me.

480
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,557
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

481
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,554
No, stop it.

482
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,359
You're a tease.

483
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,715
Fine.

484
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,836
No, I'm fine with being a tease.

485
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,596
Well, honey, just learn the lines.

486
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,434
Two characters is tough,
but you know what Olivier says.

487
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,560
"Let the wig do the work."

488
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,400
I'm gonna go before I-

489
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,597
Well, it's too late for that, isn't it?

490
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,039
Thank you for that.

491
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,036
No hard feelings.

492
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,715
Everything as it was.

493
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,070
I missed you.

494
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,271
Do you feel guilty?

495
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,953
No.

496
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,797
This happened a long time ago.

497
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,033
Ugh, menthols.

498
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,273
I don't miss that.

499
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,399
Is this what it would have been like
if we'd stayed together?

500
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,316
I don't think about that anymore.

501
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,877
I'm happy in my life.

502
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,191
Let's just enjoy this.

503
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,952
But you used to?

504
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,350
What are you thinking right now?

505
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,838
I'm thinking about how different you are,
before and after.

506
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,318
I love the way you look at me
when you're like this.

507
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,670
But then I watch it decay.

508
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,755
I can only hold your attention so long.

509
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,078
Why is sex the definition
of being close to someone?

510
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,630
I don't know, but it is for me.

511
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,357
It is for most people.

512
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,754
Just because you climb a mountain
doesn't mean you love it.

513
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,880
Climbing a mountain.
Is that what making love is to you?

514
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,953
If we'd lied here together
with you in my arms...

515
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,032
I would have felt just as close.

516
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,276
But the rest of it- I don't know.

517
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,840
I don't know.

518
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,951
It doesn't mean that much to me.

519
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,071
Is it the same with Megan?

520
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,191
Why do you want to talk about that?

521
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,754
That poor girl.

522
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:44,795
She doesn't know that loving you
is the worst way to get to you.

523
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,916
Are you sure you don't
want to just hold me?

524
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,920
Oh, Jesus.

525
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,879
Oh, thank God. What are you doing in here?

526
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,633
I was just fixing the window.

527
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,120
What the hell happened here?

528
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,317
I'll replace it tomorrow
when I get back from work.

529
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,757
Because you're leaving me here after
someone threw a rock through our window?

530
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,354
That's not what happened.

531
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,319
Well, I came in here and there's glass
all over the floor...

532
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,834
and you're holding a rock.

533
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,310
I'm tired of being interrogated
in my own home.

534
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,120
Do you think they saw you
talking to the police?

535
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,398
If you're gonna let your imagination run
wild, come to the paper with me tonight.

536
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,551
Abe, I have to go to work tomorrow.

537
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,279
And this is our bedroom.

538
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,238
Someone was in our yard.

539
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,152
I'm really scared here.

540
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,471
And you're going to protect me?
You only have one hand.

541
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,395
You're right.

542
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,951
We'll start looking. Put it on the market.

543
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,599
You'd really do that for me?

544
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,514
Maybe we're not cut out to be pioneers.

545
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,353
Sleep in the parlor if you're worried.
I won't wake you.

546
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,673
Hello?

547
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,231
You took a four-year-old
to see <i>Planet of the Apes?</i>

548
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,716
He's been having nightmares all night.

549
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,439
Hold on. Hold on.

550
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,920
He wanted to see that.

551
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,719
He doesn't decide that.

552
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,598
Well, Don took <i>his</i> kid.

553
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,912
Don Draper, Father of the Year.

554
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,997
Margaret, honey, he loved it.

555
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,800
Put him on. I'll do Dr. Zaius again.
He laughs like an idiot.

556
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,310
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise.

557
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,278
You're not funny, Daddy.

558
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,353
We'll probably have to get rid of the dog-
he's that afraid of fur.

559
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,829
Listen, I saw <i>The Golem</i>
when I was his age.

560
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,197
You don't even know what scary is.
I was fine. It's not my fault.

561
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,751
Yeah, you're right. It's my fault.

562
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,390
For letting you talk me into having a
four-year-old watch another four-year-old.

563
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,917
Listen to me, young lady.
You calm down this minute.

564
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,480
No, Daddy, you listen to me.

565
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,791
You can keep up your fantasy
of acting like a father...

566
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,314
but your grandfather days are done.

567
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,711
I'm sorry you're upset. I'm coming over.

568
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,234
- I'll calm him down.
<i>- No.</i>

569
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,677
And call Mother next time you want to see
him, 'cause she has to be there.

570
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,480
- Morning.
- Good morning.

571
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,119
Good to see you.

572
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,639
It's such a project going to the beach.

573
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,439
Can I go get Kevin?

574
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,273
Let him sleep a little more.

575
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,357
I'd love to get one
of those summer rentals.

576
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,955
Doesn't Pete Campbell have a beach house?

577
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,760
I wouldn't ask him for anything.

578
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,194
Don't you like him?

579
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,760
It's not that.

580
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,879
Actually, he's the only person there
who's never broken a promise to me.

581
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,077
He's a very generous person.

582
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,311
And frankly, I think
he's having a rough time.

583
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,471
So he told you about his mother?

584
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,029
No, I wish he would have. What's wrong?

585
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,919
He needs a nurse.

586
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,639
He's not gonna ask you. He's too ashamed.

587
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,353
She back from the track already?

588
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,353
Ugh. She must have forgotten her keys.

589
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,952
Oh. Hello, Roger.

590
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,915
- Who are you?
- It's me, Bob Benson.

591
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,957
From the office.

592
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,719
What are you doing here?

593
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,156
Oh, I was, uh, out shopping...

594
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,914
and I realized I had misplaced
some paperwork.

595
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,390
And I, uh-

596
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,153
What are you two doing?

597
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,720
We're leaving for the beach.

598
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,996
- I should go get the car.
- Good idea.

599
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,151
No, Mr. Sterling is just leaving.

600
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,677
Roger, I'm sure this can wait till Monday.

601
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,951
Sure, absolutely. Sorry about that, Bob.

602
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,997
I guess we're all a little bit
out of context right now.

603
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,639
I take no offense.

604
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,034
Didn't know you were friends.

605
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,798
Some people never stop working.

606
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,517
I'm going to freshen up
and we'll get out of here.

607
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,236
It's our block! Get outta here!

608
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,800
Get out!

609
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,272
What's going on?

610
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,756
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

611
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,274
Jesus!

612
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,272
Why didn't you say something?

613
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,597
- What do I do?
- Don't pull it out.

614
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,032
- If I don't make it-
- Stop it.

615
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,839
You're going to make it.

616
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,553
He's going to make it.

617
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,640
Look, I don't want you to think
this is about what you did.

618
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,032
It was an accident. I feel horrible.

619
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,954
No, you're scared.

620
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,597
You're a scared person
who hides behind complacenc-

621
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,080
cy.

622
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,197
Save your strength.
You're not making any sense.

623
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,636
I don't know why
I thought you'd be braver.

624
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,315
You're... in advertising.

625
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,632
Don't do this right now.
I said I was sorry.

626
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,712
Your activities are offensive
to my every waking moment.

627
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,314
I'm sorry.

628
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,311
But you'll always be the enemy.

629
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,520
Are you breaking up with me?

630
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,917
Gotta hand it to you.

631
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,990
You gave me a great ending to my article.

632
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,915
Oh, you're back.

633
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,314
Did you have fun?

634
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,880
I missed you.

635
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,837
Well, I miss you all the time.

636
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,952
I don't know when I started pretending
like everything was sunny.

637
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,394
I don't know where you've gone,
but I'm here.

638
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,077
I keep trying to make things the way
they used to be, but I don't know how.

639
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,957
And maybe that's stupid
or young to think like that, but...

640
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,232
something has to change.

641
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,149
Megan.

642
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,352
You're right.
I haven't been here.

643
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,118
Roger, please.

644
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,839
Come on. Just take it.

645
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,593
They're Lincoln Logs.

646
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,836
I thought maybe
he'd build his mother a house.

647
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,752
You can't drop in on me like that.

648
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,479
But I want to.

649
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,234
Oh, Roger, I'm so sorry,
but you can't do this.

650
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,549
Why not?

651
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,155
Because it's too confusing.

652
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,357
For Kevin. You know.

653
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,478
But I'm his father.

654
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,517
No, his father is Greg.

655
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,114
But I'm here.

656
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,435
For now.

657
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,994
But every day Greg is some hero out there...

658
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,640
and I'd rather him think
that is the man in his life.

659
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,918
Who's gonna watch TV with him?
Bob "Bunson"?

660
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,957
I just want to be around.

661
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,191
I know you want to.

662
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,719
But I can't count on that.

663
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,879
Thank you for the gift.

664
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,830
Something delicate
has come to my attention.

665
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,350
Have a seat.

666
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,957
I, uh- I've really debated
whether to bring this up with you...

667
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,556
because I don't want to put you
in a strange position...

668
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,395
and in the end it's probably just gossip.

669
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,873
It's come to my attention...

670
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,600
that you may be in need
of a nurse for your mother.

671
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,876
Joan had no right to tell you that.

672
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,711
His name is Manolo Colón.

673
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,635
He's an army-trained registered nurse,
and he's available now only because...

674
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,633
he's brought my father
back to full health.

675
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,679
Is he Spanish from Spain?
Because otherwise Mother will refuse.

676
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,913
He's very well-bred.

677
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,311
And don't blame Joan.

678
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,871
She was concerned about you
and had exhausted her resources...

679
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,874
and is well aware that your well-being
is also an interest of mine.

680
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,470
Good morning.

681
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,870
- Is he in?
- Yes, just a minute.

682
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,957
It's okay.

683
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,999
Hi. Good morning.

684
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,958
Good morning.

685
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,520
I just wanted to-

686
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,120
I needed to talk to you.

687
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,640
Peggy, what's wrong?

688
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,993
I, uh-

689
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,279
Abe got stabbed.

690
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,869
My goodness.
Is he okay? What happened?

691
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,792
He's going to be fine.

692
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,632
But it's over.

693
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,950
We're done.

694
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,994
I'm sorry to hear that.

695
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,597
You are?

696
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,317
You'll find someone else.

697
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,199
And whoever he is, he's lucky to have you.

698
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,714
Thank you.

699
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,519
You ready to get to work?

700
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,920
Excuse me?

701
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,993
It's Monday morning, Peggy.
Brand-new week.

702
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,277
Morning. How was your weekend?

703
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,832
How'd it go with Fleischmann's?

704
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,480
They just called. Full speed ahead.

705
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,480
Good work.

706
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,880
Round up the team.
