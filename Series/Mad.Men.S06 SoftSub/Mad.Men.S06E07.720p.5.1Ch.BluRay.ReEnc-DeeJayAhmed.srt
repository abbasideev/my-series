1
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,996
I don't care, Arnold.
I don't care.Just go!

2
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,437
When you get to Minnesota,
tell them what a big deal you are!

3
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,716
Tell them how you don't
listen to anyone...

4
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,269
'cause you've got it all figured out!

5
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,239
"Sylvia, this is our future."

6
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,279
"Sylvia, anything you want. Sylvia-"

7
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,829
Guess what, Arnie. I don't want it.

8
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,232
You have nothing to say?

9
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,836
You're not taking care of me!
You're taking care of you!

10
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,551
Good! Leave!

11
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,391
Don't forget to take some money!

12
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,512
Ted.

13
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,235
First day of school. You nervous?

14
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,277
What do you think?

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,636
It seems silly to ask,
but do you know where you're going?

16
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,996
I'll just follow you.

17
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,357
- Hello, everyone.
- Hey!

18
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,194
Stan, Ginsberg, Ted Chaough.

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,069
This is Margie.
Margie, Peggy. Margie, Ted.

20
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,753
It's nice to put faces with names.

21
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,958
I saw you taking your little tour the other week,
and you looked pretty tall.

22
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,633
But now I see you're about my height.

23
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,189
I hope you can still look up to me.

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,237
- That was quick.
- Pleasure, Margie.

25
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,716
I've heard a lot about you.
We're all very excited.

26
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,759
Nice knowing you.

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,995
John Mathis.

28
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,197
You're in the second office
from reception.

29
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,034
Your secretary will be Connie.

30
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,113
You know my name, but I don't know yours.

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,029
Excuse me.Joan,
are all the creatives in one office?

32
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,875
- It's temporary.
- Well, it's going to be very crowded.

33
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,714
But that may change soon.

34
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,200
I know where all the bodies are buried.

35
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,079
- I need a copy of that.
- They're just notes.

36
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,675
I need a copy for Mr. Chaough.
He's not going to change anything...

37
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,150
but he's going to be angry
if I don't know what it is.

38
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,794
Good morning, Moira.

39
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,679
- Joan.
- Good morning.

40
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,594
- Well, hello there.
- Hello.

41
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,878
- I'm sorry they didn't have your office ready yet.
- I'll make do.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,232
You know what, Moira?
I'll take care of Miss Olson.

43
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,312
Hopefully you can read my handwriting.

44
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,194
We're putting you in Harry's old office.

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,511
- But you don't have to share it.
- As long as I don't have to share Phyllis.

46
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,759
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

47
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,878
It could be moving boxes,
or it could be I slept funny.

48
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,953
Are you still in there?

49
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,396
Yes, everything keeps changing out here...

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,631
but everything's the same in there.

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,475
- Except you're a partner.
- And you're the copy chief.

52
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,557
- How's your little boy?
- He's the man in my life.

53
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,711
- How's yours?
- Oh, he's good.

54
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,553
We bought a building together to live in.

55
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,155
We bought a building to live in together.

56
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,955
- I'm glad you're here.
- Well, I'm glad you're here.

57
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,195
"In addition to
the dynamic press reception...

58
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,670
and renewed interest from Wall Street...

59
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,516
the union of these two agencies
has already brought us victory.

60
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,399
Our congratulations to Mr. Chaough...

61
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,871
and Mr. Gleason for their recent victory
at the Clio Awards...

62
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,795
for the one-minute television commercial
'Little Headaches'...

63
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,035
on behalf of
St.Joseph's Children's 'Aspirine.'

64
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,795
In closing..."

65
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,317
Well, that's a beautiful message
to read to our employees...

66
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,757
but perhaps it's best to wait until
we've made all of the personnel changes.

67
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,354
And you need an ending.

68
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,000
We have a lot of writers out there.

69
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,680
I'm sorry.
Someone commandeered Clara.

70
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,114
I need a seat.

71
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,552
Don took the last one.
That means you were here after Don.

72
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,599
Can you see if there's another chair?

73
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,359
Or you could have my seat.

74
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,399
Yes, thank you.

75
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,874
Moira, take my chair.

76
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,034
Now that we've dispensed
with the gallantry...

77
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,000
Jim Cutler and I have, we believe,
harvested the gold dusting of the Clios...

78
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,636
by arranging for an advanced introduction
to Fleischmann's Margarine.

79
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,713
They want to be Ted and Don's
first love child.

80
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,314
That's new business.

81
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,756
Isn't there a section of
this meeting called good news?

82
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,634
I never would have taken <i>you</i>
for such a stickler.

83
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,519
Fleischmann's? Groovy.
We'll get right on that.

84
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,353
Regarding ongoing business...

85
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,036
the following is a list
of current accounts in ascending order.

86
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,032
That means smallest to largest...

87
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,840
Chevrolet being excluded
for a separate meeting.

88
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,037
Topaz Pantyhose.

89
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,750
Ken Cosgrove and Burt Peterson.
And they're thrilled.

90
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,072
- Leica Camera.
- Roger and I might have to go to Germany.

91
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,994
But that's only because
we invited ourselves.

92
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,639
The New York State Thruway.

93
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,280
I just got off the phone
with Henry Lammott at Mohawk Airlines-

94
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,717
- Mohawk's on the next page.
- This is related to the Thruway.

95
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,792
Henry Lammott considers it a conflict...

96
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,190
car travel and air travel
being mortal enemies.

97
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,636
So when Burt Peterson gets ahold of them,
we should resign.

98
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,791
Did you tell Lammott that was a stretch?

99
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,520
It's a $250,000 media budget.

100
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,080
Mohawk is an airline.

101
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,119
Except, Ted, the client is New York State...

102
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,078
and they gave us their media buy up front.

103
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,550
- And you already spent it.
- Why didn't you tell us that?

104
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,429
Why didn't you tell us you lost Vicks
for yourself and Clearasil for us?

105
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,434
- Why didn't you tell us Frank Gleason was dying?
- Frank's going to be fine.

106
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,751
I know Henry Lammott.

107
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,877
Pete and I will fly up there.

108
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,794
- And Ted.
- Of course.

109
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,430
- What kind of plane do you have?
- A Mohawk plane.

110
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,034
Ted's a pilot.

111
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,151
I'll take us up there.
We can land right outside his office.

112
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,160
- Even better.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

113
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,038
Mr. Campbell,
there's an urgent phone call for you.

114
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,638
However we're going...

115
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,189
I recommend we go up tomorrow.

116
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,198
What's the next client?

117
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,994
Koss Headphones.

118
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,549
Burt Peterson and Ken Cosgrove.

119
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,872
They sent Burt Peterson
a case of champagne.

120
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,959
- Billy?
- Mr. Campbell...

121
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,312
I didn't want to trouble you,
but she was-

122
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,869
Yeah. She's right here.
You want to talk to her?

123
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,360
What happened exactly?

124
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,354
Well, she was banging on the door pretty hard
saying she needed to see your father.

125
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,511
I thought somebody was gonna call a cop.

126
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,954
May I speak with her?

127
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,594
Bill, you've been so decent.
I hate to ask you another favor...

128
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,911
but could you get her
a "G" and "T" with two ice cubes?

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,674
- Gin and tonic?
- Yes, if you don't mind.

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,753
I don't know what's going on...

131
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,912
but I found this address
on my nightstand...

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,992
in some woman's handwriting...

133
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,640
and I assumed your father
was up to his old tricks.

134
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,916
Mother, he passed away.

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,151
You'd like that. No.

136
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,792
He hasn't been home for over a week,
and his golf clubs are still at the house.

137
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,432
- Mother, you sound confused.
- What are you implying?

138
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,230
I want you to relax, watch the television,
and I will call Bud to come and get you!

139
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,789
He's going to send that girl Trudy.

140
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,997
Bud's wife is Judy, not Trudy.

141
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,232
Now I suppose I'm crazy
for mixing <i>those</i> up.

142
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,993
Tell Billy you're fine on your own.

143
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,639
I am.

144
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,912
Hello there.

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,310
Nice to see you, Peggy.

146
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,830
Burt.

147
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,230
We're a long way from Sterling Cooper.

148
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,676
Looks like the worm has turned.

149
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,151
Well, it's nice to have
the old team back together.

150
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,874
Do you want me to get that?

151
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,959
- Hello.
- Oh, I was expecting a secretary.

152
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,759
There isn't one on the line, is there?

153
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,071
Hold on.

154
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,234
I've got to take this.

155
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,671
Well, we'll have plenty of time to
catch up on those flights to Detroit.

156
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,514
He's still a cold fish.

157
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,594
Hello.

158
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,149
Come over here now.

159
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,118
I can't.

160
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,476
I have too much going on in the office.

161
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,358
I need you...

162
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,636
and nothing else will do.

163
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,360
So?

164
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,474
12!30 at the Sherry-Netherland.

165
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,916
Call me with the room number.

166
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,630
Come on in, Burt.

167
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,596
- Have a seat.
- What is this, a bed?

168
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,560
Yeah. You might want to lie down,
because here we are again.

169
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,190
Well, I haven't forgotten anything.

170
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,192
Not a damn thing.

171
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,511
A lot of times in life
you get to do something...

172
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,991
and you don't realize until it's over
how much you enjoyed it.

173
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,992
And you swear that the next time
it comes around...

174
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,912
you're gonna remember that.

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,072
You're right.
And I think I can work with you too.

176
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,072
Work?

177
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,720
No, Burt, I'm letting you go again.

178
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,797
What the hell? You can't do that.

179
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,760
Probably doesn't make a difference
at this point, but no one fought for you.

180
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,356
We'll see what the folks at Chevy
have to say about this.

181
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,318
Remember Ken Cosgrove?

182
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,234
Like a six-foot version of Alan Ladd?

183
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,232
He's touring the plant right now.

184
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,674
You bastard.

185
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,717
I've got four million in billings.

186
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,275
- What have you got?
- I was thinking you would feel that way.

187
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,239
That you had more clients,
and that gives you a voice.

188
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,791
I was imagining you
talking over me in meetings.

189
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,872
Now I don't have that problem.

190
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,952
My clients will leave with me!

191
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,912
No one will ever say
you weren't funny, Burt.

192
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,471
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
I'm expecting some kind of severance.

193
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,552
Who knows? We're really hurting.

194
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,677
We're having to cut back.
Well, obviously.

195
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,479
God, you're a real prick. You know that?

196
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,029
Damn it, Burt, you stole my good-bye.

197
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,517
Oh, hello. You must be Burt Peterson.

198
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,354
I'm Bob Benson.
I'm supposed to report to you.

199
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,318
Well, as a first order of business...

200
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,110
I recommend that you stick your head
between your legs and kiss your ass good-bye.

201
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,679
What did you say to me?

202
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,997
Come see me?

203
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,719
No.

204
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,515
I need you...

205
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,796
and nothing else will do.

206
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,914
You worked on the Daisy?

207
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,430
No, I worked on the K.K.K. spot.

208
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,432
You probably heard about it.
It was too hot to run.

209
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,273
- That's very impressive.
- Thank you.

210
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,511
I mean, you made it
15 minutes before you brought it up.

211
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,752
I just spoke with Dawn.

212
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,479
Black or white?

213
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,358
She wouldn't tell me anything.

214
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,193
She's an excellent secretary.

215
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,431
I'm sure he can catch up.

216
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,313
So before we inundate ourselves...

217
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,757
with Fleischmann's unique benefits
and previous work...

218
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,914
I want to- I don't know- have a little rap
session about margarine in general.

219
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,833
You mean like in terms of the prospect?

220
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,957
Just whatever's on your mind.
Free-associate.

221
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,512
My grandmother.

222
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,273
Yeah.

223
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,273
- Yellow.
- Yes.

224
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,760
Greasy.

225
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,594
It's not butter.
It's cheap. It has no smell.

226
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,273
Yeah, man. Keep going.

227
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,273
- People hate it.
- Hold on a second. Who hates margarine?

228
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,955
- You said there were no wrong answers.
- I didn't say that.

229
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,394
I don't hate it.

230
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,759
It was invented for Napoleon III...

231
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,992
because armies need to move,
and it never spoiled.

232
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,673
That's fantastic.

233
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,674
- How did you know that?
- I don't know. I just did.

234
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,479
Let's get down 10 uses for margarine.

235
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,119
French army is number one.

236
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,831
And, of course, I was upset...

237
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,718
because I was waiting
for Mitchell to call.

238
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,156
Then Arnie tells me
to cut the apron strings.

239
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,720
All of France is on fire.

240
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,712
I don't even know
if the phones are working.

241
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,951
There's no room for me
to worry about anyone but Arnold...

242
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,520
not even our son.

243
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,877
You can talk about your kid...

244
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,838
but I don't want to hear
about your husband.

245
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,593
I can talk about whatever I want.

246
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,110
Can you help me look
for my shoes while you do it?

247
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,317
You want me to look for your shoes?

248
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,034
I want you to crawl on your
hands and knees until you find them.

249
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,356
They're right over there.

250
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,353
Do it.

251
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,394
I want you to get undressed,
then get back into bed.

252
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,754
Come over here.

253
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,151
Don't go anywhere.

254
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,116
I'm hearing a lot about bread.

255
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,995
It spreads easy because it's soft.

256
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,671
Really melts into the-

257
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,116
What did he just say?

258
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,157
Don. There you are.

259
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,757
Sorry about that. I got held up.

260
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,596
Let's not push too hard today.

261
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,990
- What'd I miss?
- We got some good ideas...

262
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,112
and I think we're ready
for a more traditional approach-

263
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,637
research, et cetera- later in the week.

264
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,360
Great. Peggy, you set the meeting.

265
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,877
What was that?

266
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,792
What? You called the meeting to a close.

267
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,360
You also had it without me.

268
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,437
If the meeting's at 1!00,
the meeting's at 1!00.

269
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,512
Don, five minutes, 10 minutes-

270
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,557
I've been working
in creative my whole life. It's fine.

271
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,199
40 minutes? Come on.

272
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,834
I've got better things to do...

273
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,310
but obviously you did too.

274
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,154
Hello.

275
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,993
Are you still in bed?

276
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,878
Are you on your way?

277
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,914
You're going to wait there...

278
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,356
and you're not going to know
when I'm coming back.

279
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,357
What's gotten into you?

280
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,598
Don't answer the phone again.

281
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,273
- Yes?
<i>- Mr. Draper is here to see you.</i>

282
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,352
Send him in.

283
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,915
- Am I bothering you?
- What is that?

284
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,390
An olive branch.

285
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,711
I was just thinking
that it's probably best...

286
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,871
if we talk about margarine by ourselves.

287
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,351
Sorry. I don't know what you drink.

288
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,874
Whatever there is.

289
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,156
Of course, everything's packed away.

290
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,870
I would have opened that first.
Might have clients coming in.

291
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,515
I have something better for the clients-
this bar cart wheeled in.

292
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,479
- How is that better?
- You should see the girl who wheels it in.

293
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,074
It's quite a presentation.

294
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,117
If you don't want to drink,
you don't have to drink.

295
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,597
So, you want to show me
your notes from the meeting?

296
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,151
It took 40 minutes to figure out
no one knows shit about margarine.

297
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,514
May I?

298
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,991
Is this gonna be Detroit again? You're gonna
lie down on the couch while I pace?

299
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,595
I'll lie down after we have our next one.

300
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,514
Let's get something on paper first.

301
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,120
- Where is she?
- Well, she spent 25 minutes...

302
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,079
looking for a dish for the nuts
and then she went into the bathroom.

303
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,879
- Good luck.
- Where are you going?

304
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,680
She's using the ladies' room.
She's been doing it for years.

305
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,116
- No, take her home.
- My home?

306
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,840
- That's not an option.
- That is the only option.

307
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,639
Do you have any idea
what's going on in my office?

308
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,440
We're in the middle of a merger, in case
you didn't get past the sports section.

309
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm supposed to suddenly care...

310
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,754
after you went to White Weld
to underwrite your public offering?

311
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,752
I caught a shovelful for that, Pete.

312
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,036
I got to pretend to my partners
that you don't believe in nepotism.

313
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,316
I apologize that you didn't
get on that sinking ship.

314
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,792
You just ride out this merger,
and in six months I'm your first call.

315
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,999
You don't understand. I went to a meeting
this morning and there was no chair for me.

316
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,560
You're as high-strung as her.

317
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,314
First you don't have a chair,
then you don't have any clients.

318
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,120
- Mother, it's time to go.
- Don't do that yet.

319
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,839
Just get your thoughts together.

320
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,116
- You have a long drive home.
- She has an apartment.

321
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,476
Even the cleaning woman quit.

322
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,632
Mother's cut all ties. The whole place
smells like a rabbit warren.

323
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,916
Judy and I have taken our turn.
Now it's yours.

324
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,196
No, that is not going to work.

325
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,152
Judy is finished with her.

326
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,154
They got in a dispute about
Earl Grey or Major Grey...

327
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,079
and Mother snapped her
with a tea towel across the face.

328
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,995
- She should be locked up.
- Maybe we can get the paperwork started.

329
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,192
In the meantime,
buy Trudy a catcher's mask...

330
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,715
and be happy that you get
to go to work every day.

331
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,357
I know why he's late for everything.

332
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,920
Because we've put up with it.

333
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,358
I mean, honestly,
is Peter any busier than you are?

334
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,760
Mother, I'm Peter.

335
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,356
Do you want to go to the Colony?
That's a splendid idea.

336
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,437
No, I have some soup.

337
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,159
Just take me home.

338
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,516
You're spending the night here.
You can have the bed.

339
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,353
I never sleep.

340
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,875
And you should be well rested.

341
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,952
Could you freshen this?

342
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,597
So Blue Bonnet is the girl in pigtails?

343
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,558
Mary Ann.

344
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,597
<i>Gilligan's Island</i> always works.

345
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,956
Every brand is represented.

346
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,351
So Fleischmann's is
the Marilyn Monroe redhead?

347
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,750
I don't know who's Ginger.

348
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,513
Probably Parkay.

349
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,239
Then you've got Thurston Howell-

350
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,118
Imperial with the crown.

351
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,396
I think the one that's wide open
is the Professor.

352
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,156
- Facts and figures, health benefits.
- Some kind of formula.

353
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,039
They're all made differently,
even if it's just location.

354
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,399
No, I find it interesting that
you've broken this down into a formula.

355
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,598
There's a lot of bridges to Manhattan.

356
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,434
You don't have any tricks
for when you're stuck other than-

357
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,159
Are we stuck already?

358
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,755
Let's take the competition
to a broader level.

359
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,550
Let's say there are more margarines
than characters on your TV show.

360
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,279
They all have something in common.

361
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,874
They all want off the island.

362
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,317
No, they're all not butter.
No one prefers margarine.

363
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,793
I have to eat something.

364
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,951
Doesn't ice count?

365
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,157
I'd settle for some more toast.

366
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,918
It's morning.

367
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,516
We know because we see the rooster crow.

368
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,150
A farmer's wife sets pancakes
on the kitchen table.

369
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,954
She puts a pat of margarine on top...

370
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,670
and sets the dish down next
to the yellowest fried eggs...

371
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,513
a loaf of homemade bread...

372
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,593
and a beading pitcher of heavy cream.

373
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,479
Syrup pours.

374
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,998
A smile comes over
their Dorothea Lange faces.

375
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,472
Two things- cows,
because she's a dairy farmer's wife...

376
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,119
and I want bacon.

377
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,237
It's not up for debate.

378
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,276
Just a minute.

379
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,591
I said, "Just a minute."

380
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,592
I thought you said, "Come in."

381
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,037
I got everyone's paperwork.
I just wanted to drop them off.

382
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,839
You look a little wan.

383
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,513
I think I have food poisoning.

384
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,319
Do you want some ice water?

385
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,880
God!

386
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,717
Do you have your appendix?

387
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,918
- It's the other side.
- You can't stay here.

388
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,032
And I can't leave either.

389
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,559
Just walk with me,
and I'll bother you all the way out.

390
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,154
No one will know.

391
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,077
So I get the laxative people
into the booth...

392
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,629
and I record three or four spots
at one time.

393
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,837
Who talked Topaz into television?

394
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,435
I did, but then Margie took it over.

395
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,989
The client still calls me Peggy.

396
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,037
Everybody, everybody.

397
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,713
I'm taking a survey.

398
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,476
It's Eugene McCarthy versus Bobby Kennedy.

399
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,438
How many for Kennedy?

400
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,591
Show of hands.

401
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,036
But Humphrey has all the delegates.

402
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,397
- I'm voting for Nixon.
- Oh, I knew it, Mathis.

403
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,554
What's wrong with you?
Don't you have any hope?

404
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,474
I'm for Bobby.

405
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,951
Well, I-Ted?

406
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,879
You okay?

407
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,036
Why don't you call it a day? Come on.

408
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,720
- What about him?
- Let him sleep it off.

409
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,234
- Ted, come on.
- I'm fine.

410
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,797
Drink that.

411
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,271
- Is that urine?
- It's the pipes.

412
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,272
The babysitter's agreed to stay...

413
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,319
but no word from your mother,
so I'm not leaving.

414
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,830
She's probably still in the Catskills.

415
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,877
Remember Rip Van Winkle?

416
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,474
You like that story?

417
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,552
I know it. I could tell it to you.

418
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,360
No, you should go.

419
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,875
Who knows what 20 years
will do to this place?

420
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,633
I have no place to go.

421
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,598
<i>...please call the pharmacy.</i>

422
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,036
<i>Please call the pharmacy.</i>

423
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,999
What's gonna happen to Kevin?

424
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,757
He'll either end up with my mother
or Greg's parents.

425
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,593
It's just food poisoning.

426
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,039
No, that's not what it is.

427
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,112
Come on. Let's go.

428
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,919
I've got you.

429
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,238
Excuse me, Nurse... Finnegan.

430
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,915
I see how busy you are,
but can I trouble you a moment?

431
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,151
Doctors will see you the moment they can.

432
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,879
No, it's not about that.

433
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,555
It's just, well, I'm such a fool...

434
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,996
and I suppose I was trying
to be a gentleman.

435
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,720
- But my friend here, she-
- Don't.

436
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,156
We don't need to see a doctor.

437
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,551
I'm sure it's something that would be
covered by your medical expertise.

438
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,791
What are you talking about?

439
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,633
She's a little embarrassed...

440
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,916
but she drank furniture polish.

441
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,719
Honey, why'd you do that?

442
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,918
She wasn't wearing her glasses.

443
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,674
You do need to see a doctor.
Why didn't you tell me that?

444
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,240
I'm sorry.
I really never know what to do.

445
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,639
- I thought I'd just leave it up to you.
- Okay, sweetheart. Ramirez.

446
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,115
Take her to bed four.

447
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,880
<i>...please report to Radiology.</i>

448
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,792
She'll be fine.

449
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,437
You look perfect.

450
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,155
Well, I had three hours to get ready.

451
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,197
I don't know if the shoes go.

452
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,839
They do.

453
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,719
Where are we going?

454
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,077
We're not going anywhere.

455
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,873
Are you kidding me?

456
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,634
Why would you think you're going anywhere?

457
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,996
You are for me.

458
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,676
You exist in this room for my pleasure.

459
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,752
Are we going to eat?

460
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,872
Don't ask any more questions.

461
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,440
Take off your dress.

462
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,274
Take off everything for me.

463
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,112
Like that?

464
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,832
I think you look worse than I do.

465
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,152
Well, I slept on the floor of my office.

466
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,913
They didn't give you a couch?

467
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,879
I couldn't find it. Draper knocked me out.

468
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,031
Not literally.

469
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,750
Well, I'm sure
there's a lot of work to do.

470
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,718
It's got nothing to do with work.

471
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,554
He seems more interested in me
than he is in the work.

472
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,757
But you're not very interesting.

473
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,559
He doesn't know that.

474
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,234
What's he like?

475
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,036
He's mysterious.

476
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,635
But I can't tell if he's putting it on.

477
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,471
He doesn't talk for long stretches,
and then he's incredibly eloquent.

478
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,120
Well, he's very successful.

479
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,920
You didn't think
he was charmless, did you?

480
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,957
You learned to work with me.

481
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,520
And look at you.

482
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:44,316
If I wait patiently by the river,
the body of my enemy will float by.

483
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,551
Such a waste of energy.

484
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,031
Give him the early rounds.
He'll tire himself out.

485
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,880
Go home, shower...

486
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,397
walk back in there
like you own half the place.

487
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,152
I'll be back at dinnertime.

488
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,233
- Because you live here.
- No, I don't.

489
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,631
There's a hamper full of laundry
and a razor in the sink.

490
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,279
Is Trudy finished with you?

491
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,834
This is our pied-à-terre.

492
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,311
Does your father bring prostitutes here
or is it just for yours?

493
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,880
I want to be taken home.

494
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,475
Your apartment's been overrun
with vermin.

495
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,153
They're spraying all day.

496
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,399
I didn't remember that.
I want to get my things.

497
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,030
It's raining very hard out,
and it's, well-

498
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,077
It's St. Patrick's Day.

499
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,629
- It's May.
- No, it's not.

500
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,118
And who knows what's out there?

501
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,157
I'll have the cook
make your favorite for dinner.

502
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,710
- Morning.
- You look fresh.

503
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,917
Where's my secretary?

504
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,596
Or is this how they do it at CGC?
Just let yourself in?

505
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:37,232
I didn't want to wait out there
because this whole visit is confidential.

506
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,993
You want to quit already?

507
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,639
When you told me about the merger,
I hoped he would rub off on you...

508
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,757
not the other way around.

509
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,230
He's getting everything he wants...

510
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,755
and obviously you're on his side.

511
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,752
Why did you do it at all
if there are sides?

512
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,672
You could have just tried to hire me back.

513
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,319
You never even asked me to lunch.

514
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,440
Yes, Peggy,
we risked our entire company...

515
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,716
just so I could have you in this office
complaining again.

516
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,917
Well, he can't drink like you.

517
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,599
And you must know that
because nobody can.

518
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,036
- Peggy, he's a grown man.
- So are you.

519
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,192
Move forward.

520
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,480
You're going to be fine.

521
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,280
With Burt Peterson gone, Kenny in Detroit,
everything's going to fall in your in-box.

522
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,476
What about Cutler?

523
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,273
What about every time
there's a change around here...

524
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,477
I get knocked down to a worse office?

525
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,994
Come in, Scarlett.

526
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,994
Mr. Campbell, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but you're needed on the phone.

527
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,719
What now, Clara?

528
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,234
- Is she injured?
- No, but there's been a fire.

529
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,789
Call Henry at Mohawk.
See if he can meet tomorrow.

530
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,111
I have no idea how long this will take.

531
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,350
Trudy?

532
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,709
I don't know what it is.

533
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,634
I just don't want to think about anything.

534
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,076
Who told you
you were allowed to think?

535
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,078
So, what do I do now?

536
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,633
You fall asleep
the minute I close that door.

537
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,878
I'm flying upstate...

538
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,715
and when I come back,
I want you ready for me.

539
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,720
I can do that standing on my head.

540
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,272
And I'm taking this.

541
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,353
Really? Come on.

542
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,238
I'm taking it.

543
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,229
Something's come up.
Do you have a minute for Clara?

544
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,637
- Pete Campbell's secretary.
- Certainly.

545
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,553
Mr. Campbell had an emergency
and Mr. Draper is out...

546
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,154
so I wanted to make sure you knew...

547
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,311
that we were rescheduling
this afternoon's meeting with Mohawk.

548
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,472
Absolutely not!
What the hell is going on around here?

549
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,154
- Ready to go?
- I am...

550
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,879
but apparently
Pete Campbell wants to move it.

551
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,959
We can't cancel the meeting to show a client
how important he is. When can he go?

552
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,952
It doesn't matter.
We should go up there right away.

553
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,509
It's raining pretty hard.
We can wait a couple hours.

554
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,475
Don't worry about that. Once we're above
the clouds, it's sunny as summer.

555
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,194
- How long have you been doing this?
- Not now.

556
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,552
There we go.

557
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,030
You can relax now. We're leveled off.

558
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,876
I am relaxed.

559
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,797
Sometimes when you're flying...

560
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,349
you think you're right side up,
but you're really upside down.

561
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,672
Really?

562
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,752
Got to watch your instruments.

563
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,316
You don't want to take in
the wonder of God's majesty?

564
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,518
I like to read on planes.
I don't like to talk.

565
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,319
But you're gonna talk to Henry Lammott.

566
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,312
I mean, you're the one that knows him.

567
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,756
Does it matter?

568
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,559
No matter what I say...

569
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,394
you're the guy who flew us up here
in his own plane.

570
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,351
I guess that's true.

571
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,912
I don't know if Joanie's awake.

572
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,673
I really don't need to see her.

573
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,752
You can just give Kevin my gift.

574
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,950
Hello.

575
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,077
I really wasn't planning on dropping in.

576
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,560
I just wanted to see
if you were feeling better.

577
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,872
The hospital wouldn't tell me anything
because I'm not immediate family.

578
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,719
He's two years old.
He'll play with the bow.

579
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,031
Sit down. Have a snack.

580
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,954
No, that's all. Don't want to be away
from the office too long.

581
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,514
Although I left my overcoat on my chair,
so they know I'm there.

582
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,753
Well, it's nice meeting you.

583
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,758
He's adorable.

584
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,832
He's too young.

585
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,718
I can tell you from experience...

586
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,520
that younger men are not intimidated
by powerful women.

587
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,798
- He's not interested.
- He saved your life.

588
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,156
It was just a cyst on my ovary.

589
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,551
I would have been fine.
He's worrying about his job.

590
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,950
Well, why wouldn't he?

591
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,952
It doesn't take away what he did.

592
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,193
Honestly,Joan,
every good deed is not part of a plan.

593
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,999
She left the teakettle on.
It was mostly smoke.

594
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,117
Can you get Henry Lammott on the phone?

595
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,999
I will, but Mr. Lammott
already called for you.

596
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,595
Don and Ted thought
it was best not to wait.

597
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,434
Really? They went without me?

598
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,592
Yes. Apparently it went very well.

599
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,240
Damn it, Clara. They went without me.

600
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,596
Therefore, it did not go very well.

601
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,276
You do understand
that your employment here is tied to me?

602
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,990
And if things happen without me,
they'll eventually happen without you!

603
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,158
Don't feel bad that
you were taking care of your mother.

604
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,118
My mother can go to hell.

605
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,192
Ted Chaough can fly her there.

606
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,831
Do you want me to get
Mr. Lammott on the phone?

607
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,151
Can you give me a minute?

608
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,680
I'm here.

609
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,718
Where are you going?

610
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,237
- I think it's time to go home.
- Not yet.

611
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,794
I think this is over.

612
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,516
It's over when I say it's over.

613
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,999
I had a dream that you
crashed in that plane.

614
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,594
But I'm back.

615
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,237
I dreamt I went to your funeral,
and Megan cried on my shoulder.

616
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,549
Stop it.

617
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,314
And then I went back to Arnold...

618
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,631
and I made love to him...

619
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,431
and I said,
"I've been away, but I'm home."

620
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,232
It means you missed me.

621
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,038
No.

622
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,920
It means it's time to really go home.

623
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,479
This is over, and not just this.

624
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,595
It's easy to give up something
when you're satisfied.

625
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,990
It's easy to give up something
when you're ashamed.

626
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,717
Please.

627
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,874
Let's go.

628
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,440
Burt Peterson's gone.

629
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,433
That leaves me,
Jim Torkelson and Lawrence Harris.

630
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,592
You've got Roger, Pete,
Ken and Bob Benson.

631
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,916
But you've got your creatives-
Peggy, Cecil and Beanie.

632
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,957
We lost Margie Koch and Steve Hagan.

633
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,236
I don't know who Peggy counts for,
but we need Bob.

634
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,711
Bob's got to go. Last hired, first fired.

635
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,554
Very well.

636
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,319
But before I cross him off,
let me remind you...

637
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,154
that Bob has been very
involved in Ken's accounts...

638
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,119
and with Ken servicing Detroit, I don't know
how long it'll take Lawrence to catch up.

639
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,351
Fine. Lawrence is gone. Are we done here?

640
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,877
The secretarial staff?

641
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,592
And instead of being afraid...

642
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,276
I realized I should just ask
for a couple of weeks off.

643
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,352
They write people out all the time.

644
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,870
Or I could shoot in advance
and maybe we could go to Honolulu again.

645
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,316
This time without business.

646
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,199
I just thought it would
be fun to go on a trip...

647
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,840
the two of us for a bit without the kids.

648
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,639
Peter.

649
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,600
- They shot that poor Kennedy boy.
- That was years ago, Mother.

650
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,990
I just saw it on the television.

651
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,198
- It's 6!00 a.m.
- You'll be late for school.

652
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,953
Please just let me sleep.

653
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,957
I don't understand what's going on.

654
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,111
They're shooting everybody.

655
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,158
<i>Senator Kennedy then going off
into the kitchen area...</i>

656
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,277
<i>to retire to his room for the evening...</i>

657
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,829
<i>or at least for the next hour or so...</i>

658
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,515
<i>the crowd spreading around him,
shaking hands...</i>

659
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,751
<i>clapping him on the back.</i>

660
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,033
<i>Then some shots ring out.</i>

661
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,431
CBS News <i>cameraman James Wilson
filming this.</i>

662
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:14,231
<i>And the next picture you see is that
of Senator Kennedy lying on the floor...</i>

663
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,711
<i>the crowd around him screaming,
unbelieving that such a thing could happen.</i>

664
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,434
<i>A score of hands beneath his back...</i>

665
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,193
<i>beneath his head, trying to talk to him.</i>

666
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,040
<i>At this time it was understood
that Senator Kennedy was conscious...</i>

667
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,840
<i>although it was not understood
if he said anything at all.</i>

668
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,678
<i>Senator Kennedy now
at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles...</i>

669
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,036
<i>alive, we are understood,
his heart beating.</i>
