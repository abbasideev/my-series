1
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,670
Are you sure you don't want me
to order in some food?

2
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,753
- Chinese?
- I'm sorry this is taking so long.

3
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,311
It's a common mistake
to not ask questions...

4
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,790
when you want something
because you're afraid of the answers.

5
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,872
So you want something?

6
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,519
I'm interested.

7
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,435
And considering the precedent
for small agencies...

8
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,876
this is how we might take you public.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,552
With one and a half million shares
outstanding before the offering...

10
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,237
we'd sell 400,000 additional shares
to the public at $9 a share.

11
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,199
- Twelve a share.
- It's not an insult.

12
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,114
Our valuation of your company was made
after careful analysis.

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,112
Of papers you spent 20 minutes with?

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,237
I can't take this
to the rest of my partners...

15
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,835
but I can take it to other underwriters.

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,159
I'll need these documents for 24 hours.

17
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,199
These papers are spotless.
My compliments to the chef.

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,194
Shall we?

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,355
You don't think Cooper
pushed that poor banker too hard, do you?

20
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,079
We don't want to lose him.

21
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,231
Certainly not.

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,153
It's a marvel.

23
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,072
Everyone wants you, don't they?

24
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,833
Pete, no.

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,311
No, I believe our primary hurdle
has been cleared.

26
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,993
And our secondary one?

27
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,594
Don't worry about Don.

28
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,194
Even at nine a share...

29
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,079
your part of the company alone
will be worth nearly a million dollars.

30
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,231
My goodness.

31
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,073
You're flushed.

32
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,351
I drank too fast.

33
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,750
I don't think Don cares about money.

34
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,991
That may be true, God bless him.

35
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,276
But he's tired of playing
in the bush leagues.

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,670
This capitalization will double our size...

37
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,558
and that will turn his head.

38
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,240
You want another?

39
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,438
No. I can hardly walk,
and you know it.

40
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,075
I hope Clara reminded you
tomorrow's Mother's Day.

41
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,549
Thank you. I'm aware.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,480
Ow.

43
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,279
Just wanted to make sure
you were still here.

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,477
I am, but not for long.

45
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,597
You don't even know what time it is.

46
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,720
I do.

47
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,679
Because I already got up
and put on my face.

48
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,877
Is that what you do?

49
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,600
- I wondered.
- I have to go.

50
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,871
Daisy, you're a tease.

51
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,794
What more could I give you?

52
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,078
Look, the first-class lounge would be
a darker place without you...

53
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,311
but you're supposed to have
your ear to the ground.

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,791
I feel like you only call me
when you want to see me.

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,393
Am I going to see you tomorrow?

56
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,315
If there's a flight filled with P&G executives
headed back to Cincinnati.

57
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,438
- How about tonight?
- I have plans.

58
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,831
Some other boyfriend?
The one you give all the leads to?

59
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,837
With my mother.
It's Mother's Day.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,674
- Don't go.
- I have to.

61
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,838
But my mother just died.

62
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,997
What are you doing?

63
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,115
You told me you wanted me here
Sunday morning.

64
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,998
I'm here.

65
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,870
Oh, Peter, don't.

66
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,513
So we'll just maintain
every other aspect of this marriage...

67
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,557
except the one that matters.

68
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,595
You mean Tammy?

69
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,752
Will you stop
holding the ax over my neck?

70
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,595
So you'd rather I divorce you
just so you know where things stand?

71
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,553
You don't care that I want you.

72
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,439
I've taken note of your efforts.

73
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,352
I'm going to get her.

74
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,311
Well...

75
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,551
you're gonna be sorry when this is over.

76
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,911
You've given up on me
at exactly the wrong time.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,037
I have big things coming.

78
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,271
You have no idea.

79
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,317
Well, I'll take note of that too.

80
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,792
Could you get that?

81
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,997
- Arnold. Come in.
- Hi.

82
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,231
I'm sorry to bother you.
Do you have any wrapping paper?

83
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,630
It's an emergency.

84
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,791
Good morning.

85
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,554
Sorry. This is Megan's mother Marie.

86
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,712
We passed in the lobby.
I thought you were Megan.

87
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,269
Dr. Arnold Rosen at your service.

88
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,710
<i>- Enchanté.</i>
- Are you French?

89
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,440
My kid's going to Paris.
Should I keep him home?

90
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,274
I am French, but I live in Montreal.

91
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,431
And, yes, I believe so.

92
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,318
I assume this isn't a medical emergency.

93
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,392
Mitchell- that's my son-

94
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,631
he came home and surprised her
for Mother's Day.

95
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,360
- How long is he staying?
- Who knows?

96
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,955
I know he thinks a morning stroll
in Central Park is a gift...

97
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,511
but Sylvia's gonna expect an <i>actual</i> gift.

98
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,832
Do you want my flowers?
I'm quite done with them.

99
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,196
Thank you, Mother.

100
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,159
You're a lifesaver.

101
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,200
He's a surgeon.
He's working on heart transplants.

102
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,956
Wealthy, talented, handsome-

103
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,236
I would not leave them alone.

104
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,630
I'm more worried about you.

105
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,637
There's poop on the stairs again.

106
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,193
Somebody's dog got in.

107
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,158
No, it's human.

108
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,357
I think it's from the tenant.

109
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,638
- She wouldn't do that.
- She's a junkie. She doesn't care.

110
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,677
I want her out.

111
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,757
We can't do that.

112
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,913
How is your mother?

113
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,755
I got curtains. She wants to come visit.

114
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,400
Ow! Ow.

115
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,159
Jesus.

116
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,754
We have to hire a handyman.

117
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,911
Why? It's a waste of money.

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,151
Because you have no idea
what you're doing.

119
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,159
Herb Rennet called.
He's canceling dinner tonight.

120
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,993
That's a relief.

121
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,993
We can still have dinner.
I'd love to discuss some things with you.

122
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,197
Let's enjoy our reprieve.

123
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,953
Of course.

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,559
Close the door.

125
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,236
Did he say your dinner with Jaguar is off?

126
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,512
Yes, unless it was
the world's most boring dream.

127
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,796
Well, it's on, but Pete's not invited.

128
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,759
Herb Rennet wants a word alone
to straighten things out.

129
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,320
Why can't you handle it?

130
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,756
This could be fatal. You're going.

131
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,912
And my plan is to pack it with spouses
to limit the explosion.

132
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,839
Megan made plans with her mother.
She thought I had a business dinner.

133
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,270
Marie's in town? Fantastic.

134
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,875
Bring her along. That's perfect.

135
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,792
Tell her I insisted.

136
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,351
In attendance I have Jim Cutler...

137
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,318
Frank Gleason and Ted Chaough.

138
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,756
Sweetheart, this is a creative meeting.
What are you doing?

139
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,275
It's for the purposes of the memorandum.

140
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,876
Well, Ted,
some men love women, some love memos.

141
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,429
I want to go over where we are
on Chevrolet again...

142
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,477
and devote our final days
to overdoing it...

143
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,392
on the artwork for
the top three campaigns.

144
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,472
I cannot look at these again.

145
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,236
I told you, they're very keen on the rocket
ship thing with the astronaut anecdotes.

146
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,118
You told them about the astronauts?

147
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,760
I had to. It was too vague otherwise.

148
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,912
I don't want to draw any more rockets,
and I don't want to stare at this work again.

149
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,515
We should have never resigned Alfa Romeo.

150
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,956
What, is this mystery Chevy
gonna be in <i>The Graduate?</i>

151
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,633
Those things are flying off the lot.

152
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,991
Frank, are you not on board with this?

153
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,799
I love what you're doing.

154
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,954
I'm tired of rockets, that's all.

155
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,999
Could you give us a moment?
We'll continue this later.

156
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,998
What is that, Shalimar?

157
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,239
What's gotten into you?

158
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,959
You're supposed to be calming <i>me</i> down.

159
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,157
Ted, I've got cancer.

160
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,436
What?

161
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,512
In my pancreas.

162
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,193
I told Jim. I thought he told you...

163
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,033
and you didn't want to embarrass me.

164
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,953
No.

165
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,430
Maybe it's more of
a financial issue to him...

166
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,751
but I'm glad he can keep a secret.

167
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,240
Financial?

168
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,158
The minute I cash out, I cash in.

169
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,038
You two have to buy me out.

170
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,357
You have cancer.

171
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,511
See, if we still had Alfa,
I wouldn't have to worry...

172
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,751
about putting you out of business.

173
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,479
First of all...

174
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,631
stop talking about money.

175
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,552
Second, we are going to get Chevy...

176
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,791
because you're going to do your best work.

177
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,679
Third, you're going to build a wing
at Sloan-Kettering...

178
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,479
and beat this thing.

179
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,359
Aye, aye.

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,514
Will you tell Jim you told me?

181
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,791
He'll see it on your face.

182
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,916
Everybody loves astronauts.

183
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,636
I've got to go lie down.

184
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,079
Well, hello there.

185
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,719
How are things in Glocca Morra?

186
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,076
Hello. Can you hear me?

187
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,800
I love it when you whisper like that.
What are you wearing?

188
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,673
My uniform.

189
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,400
I have one and his flight's delayed.

190
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,437
Who is he? What's he do?

191
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,079
I'm not sure...

192
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,277
but he doesn't believe
my name's really Daisy.

193
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,272
Use that.

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,037
Shit.

195
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,879
Do you mind?

196
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,870
17, please.

197
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,478
I'm sorry to bother you,
but we love your show.

198
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,359
Oh, thank you.

199
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,916
Can we get an autograph?

200
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,911
I know you're not waving to me.

201
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,236
Makes the delay worthwhile, doesn't it?

202
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,152
- Headed to Detroit?
- Eventually.

203
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,879
Should we try LaGuardia?

204
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,031
They already did. Forget it.

205
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,637
This is why I like to drive everywhere.

206
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,831
I'd live in my car if I could.

207
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,355
You know, with her
in the backseat navigating.

208
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,716
- I'm Roger. What's your name?
- Mikey.

209
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,235
Well, Mikey, since we're
gonna be cell mates...

210
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,232
I'm going to ask the screw
for a couple of drinks.

211
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,118
Jim Beam.

212
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,431
I'll make her bring them over.

213
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,160
- Good idea.
- I'm full of'em.

214
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,631
I want a glass of water with an onion
and bring him a double Jim Beam.

215
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,837
And get me on that flight.

216
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,715
This is my day off. We had plans.

217
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,872
Well, you would rather spend the evening
laughing at Roger Sterling's jokes.

218
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,590
I should return home.
I've overstayed my welcome.

219
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,999
Well, I don't know what's happened.

220
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,072
I knew something was wrong.

221
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,272
We have not had a fight.

222
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,039
He's so far away...

223
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,956
that sometimes when we're alone
I feel like I'm making conversation.

224
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,273
Darling, you have confounded
everyone's expectations.

225
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,875
And it is very hard to
stand next to someone...

226
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,519
giving an autograph.

227
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,638
- He doesn't even care.
- Of course he does.

228
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,918
But he may think you belong more
to other people than to him.

229
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,072
I love coming into the city.

230
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,916
It's 25 minutes, half hour, give or take,
from Tenafly, depending on the traffic.

231
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,596
I always think
I'm gonna go to museums and stuff.

232
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,911
And there's some good ones.
You've probably seen them.

233
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,038
But I always end up at Saks.

234
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,157
And I come home...

235
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,074
and Herb always says the same thing.

236
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,153
How much damage did you do, Peaches?

237
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,838
We always do some shopping.

238
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,639
My daughter is very generous.

239
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,792
She even invited me along
to this wonderful evening.

240
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,633
You get ahold of Silver Bells?

241
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,872
No. But that doesn't mean he's not coming.

242
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,070
- I'm pretty much done waiting.
- Perhaps we should go.

243
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,753
What?

244
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,436
No, I think we're gonna order now.

245
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,194
Herb gets very peckish.

246
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,351
I skipped lunch.

247
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,636
Can I help you, Bert?

248
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,598
You've already done all you can do.

249
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,319
Snapped this place into shape...

250
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,154
expanded our business
while keeping it lean.

251
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,312
Pending due diligence, we're done...

252
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,438
at $1 1 a share.

253
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,920
Really?

254
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,595
I believe I would like a drink.

255
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,240
What do you drink?

256
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,879
Do you have any brandy?

257
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,713
No.

258
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,632
Spirits of elderflower?

259
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,270
No. I don't have any laudanum either.

260
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,829
- Surprise me.
- Night, chief!

261
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,877
Bob, could you get Joan?

262
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,919
- And some ice.
- Absolutely.

263
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,953
When do we break the news?

264
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,112
Call the meeting for tomorrow.

265
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,909
So there she was in the garage...

266
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,754
right among the-you know,
there's an oil stain...

267
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,480
that Herb's been meaning to take care of.

268
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,680
There she is, our little puppy
with a full litter.

269
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,480
You're right, Mother.
They must have been adorable.

270
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,635
There's one yellow and one brown
and then three sort of mixed.

271
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,633
Each one at its own nipple.

272
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,919
- I love puppies.
- Not the way she does.

273
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,719
You know what?

274
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,998
Why don't we let the men discuss the business
they're probably here to talk about...

275
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,833
while we powder our noses?

276
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,794
Tall and tan and young and lovely.

277
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,950
So why are we here, Herb?

278
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,556
Oh, it's nothing serious.
I just had an idea.

279
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,714
There's a kid who's been writing fliers
for me at a few of my lots...

280
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,998
and I'm really getting results.

281
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,231
He's got a good turn of phrase.

282
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,959
I think you'd appreciate it.

283
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,997
Is he looking for a job?

284
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,072
No, he's got a job.

285
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,631
I just thought that
it might help you and me...

286
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,479
if he were to take a look
at some of your work...

287
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,313
even at the formative stages...

288
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,471
just to get his take on it.

289
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,197
What's his name?

290
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,399
Fawcett.

291
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,598
Chris Fawcett.

292
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,553
Here you go.

293
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,279
What is this?

294
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,876
It's the name of the guy who's going to be
handling your account from now on.

295
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,120
You never fail to overheat, do you?

296
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,750
You know the somersaults I'm doing
'cause you're so touchy?

297
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,076
Really? A man your size?

298
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,072
You know what?

299
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,632
Your whole company
should be taken to the woodshed.

300
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,916
First Campbell gives me the sass.

301
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,515
Then Sterling, he didn't even show up.

302
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,717
And you-Yeah.

303
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,998
My friend, you're gonna
be working for him.

304
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,753
And he could teach you something...

305
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,957
like knowing where your bread is buttered.

306
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,992
Why don't you get this?

307
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,912
I want you to buy me one last meal.

308
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,878
I'm tired of taking it
out of your account.

309
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,553
Okay.

310
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,714
And if you ever see Sterling again,
tell him you screwed up...

311
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,757
'cause I'm done with all of youse.

312
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,355
Don't sit down. Dinner's over.

313
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,750
Are you okay?

314
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,838
Never felt better in my life.

315
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,754
Nice meeting you. See you soon.

316
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,840
My mother needs an aspirin.

317
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,912
I don't care.

318
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,835
- Hello?
- Marie.

319
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,515
It's Roger. I'm so glad I got you.

320
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,831
If you are calling to apologize,
don't bother.

321
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,310
- It's too late. Good night.
- Hold on. Don't hang up.

322
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,438
- Let me talk to Don.
- Did you call to talk to Don?

323
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,514
Yes, but I was hoping you were there.
You were next, I swear.

324
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,717
<i>You dragged me out and made me sit...</i>

325
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,237
with that disgusting man
with his disgusting wife.

326
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,960
She is the apple that goes
in the pig's mouth.

327
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,475
Marie, I swear
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

328
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,075
It's just something came up...

329
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,234
something very important
that I need to talk to Don about.

330
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,835
<i>You are speaking slowly
so I will understand?</i>

331
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,792
Forget... my... name.

332
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,999
Excuse me.

333
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,720
Is it possible for me
to pay for my friend?

334
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,158
Yes, but it's too late for that.

335
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,516
What are you bugging him for?

336
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,592
Aren't I enough for you?

337
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,115
This is my friend.
What was your fake name again?

338
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,190
Curious George?

339
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,836
You're a riot.

340
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,919
Hello.

341
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,634
Good night.

342
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,558
Isn't that guy a client?

343
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,111
- Is he gone?
- Yes.

344
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,515
I have a high-level accounts question.

345
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,000
A hypothetical.

346
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,117
So it doesn't involve
anybody in this room?

347
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,917
Let's say you caught your father-in-law
in a compromising position.

348
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,152
It's every Sunday night.
The guy can't hold his liquor.

349
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,158
Last night I was celebrating at that
party house up on Lex...

350
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,039
and I saw my father-in-law
exit the bedroom...

351
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,956
with the biggest, blackest prostitute
you've ever seen.

352
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,879
Was there anyone else from Vicks there?

353
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,118
Not that I saw. But we spoke.

354
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,120
I mean, all I said was hello, but-

355
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,591
Okay, look, when I was in high school...

356
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,718
they had this picture come
to the only movie theater in Cabot.

357
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,439
It was called <i>Making A Baby.</i>

358
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,318
They invited women and men separately...

359
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,313
but it was a delivery system
for some filthy stuff.

360
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,869
So at the matinee, I look over...

361
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,919
and Mr. Miller,
my science teacher, is five seats away.

362
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,755
And he's not, you know,
working the slide rule or anything...

363
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,639
but we see each other for sure.

364
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,350
But we both knew
that neither of us should be there.

365
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,556
It was mutually assured destruction.

366
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,200
So he's not going to say anything?

367
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,112
He can't.

368
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,669
<i>Mr. Cosgrove, I have a phone call.</i>

369
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,911
Give me a second.

370
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,957
It's why I don't worry about the bomb.

371
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,872
<i>It's urgent.</i>

372
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,031
<i>I have Hugh Hibbert
and John Echolls from Jaguar.</i>

373
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,516
Why are they calling you? Pick it up.

374
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,753
This is Ken.

375
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,633
Good morning.

376
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,633
Do you have any idea where Roger has been
for the last 24 hours?

377
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,871
- I don't.
- Draper!

378
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,831
What in the hell have you-

379
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,233
- What?
- You have done it again.

380
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,232
What did you say
to Herb Rennet last night?

381
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,152
Nothing that shouldn't
have been said last Christmas.

382
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,677
As usual, you have acted impulsively
and harmed the company irreparably.

383
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,798
- Pete, calm down.
- We already lost the account.

384
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,752
He was gonna bring in
some kid to write copy.

385
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,837
That's because
you screwed him last time!

386
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,149
You couldn't wait!

387
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,438
Pete, you've gotta understand
when it's over.

388
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,957
Do you know that we had a public offering
under way? And now it's ruined!

389
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,318
- What?
- You don't care about the company.

390
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,198
- You're already rich.
- Not here.

391
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,431
Inside.

392
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,635
- What is going on?
- Why the hell didn't I know about this?

393
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,200
- We're going public?
- Not anymore.

394
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,476
- When did that happen?
- I was going to tell you this morning.

395
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,120
I tried to last night, but you'd rather
have dinner with Herb Rennet.

396
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,112
Well, I have some good news
and some bad news.

397
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,795
- Where the hell have you been?
- Don fired Jaguar.

398
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,957
What?

399
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,597
Then I just have good news.

400
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,752
We're giving a presentation this Friday
on Chevy's top secret new car.

401
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,513
- What?
- Friday?

402
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,478
Come on! You've been thinking
about Chevy your whole life.

403
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,314
- Are you serious?
- And I have this check for $10,000.

404
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,916
Because I close, Pete. I close things.

405
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,673
Did I mention I was in Detroit...

406
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,229
where my friend Mikey O'Brien-
look him up-

407
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,397
said he was looking for
something cutting-edge...

408
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,119
but none of the agencies had it?

409
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,795
So he had a great idea- bring us in.

410
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,872
We're not afraid of a deadline.

411
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,520
Holy crap. Chevy.

412
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,798
You want to go public?
How much better is it when we have Chevy?

413
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,394
Don't act like you had a plan.

414
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,756
You're Tarzan swinging from vine to vine.

415
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,309
Roger, I want to know everything.
Pete, go box up Jaguar.

416
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,437
Make sure they have all their files today.

417
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,352
Joan, get the creatives in my office.

418
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,238
Get them yourself.

419
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,432
Don't you feel 300 pounds lighter?

420
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,512
I don't.

421
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,553
Honestly, Don, if I could deal with him,
you could deal with him.

422
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,197
And what now?

423
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,749
I went through all of that for nothing?

424
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,195
Joan, don't worry. I will win this.

425
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,073
Just once...

426
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,800
I would like to hear you
use the word "we."

427
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,157
Because we're all rooting for you
from the sidelines...

428
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,870
hoping that you'll decide
whatever you think is right for <i>our</i> lives.

429
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,192
In my office, all of you.

430
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,913
Should we go in there?

431
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,878
I don't care.

432
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,957
XP-887.

433
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,077
- So we get to name it?
- Possibly.

434
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,117
For now it's all cloak-and-dagger.

435
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,873
They've got a room full of R&D on this.

436
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,077
But it boils down
to Chevrolet's top brass...

437
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,072
trying to build the perfect car.

438
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,999
- They designed it with a computer.
- So they're scared.

439
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,589
They run another agency in
at the one-yard line.

440
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,115
- They're terrified.
- So who else is in it?

441
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,320
Well, the guest list limping in
is as follows- Campbell-Ewald.

442
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,596
Chevy's right arm.
They got 200 people in Detroit.

443
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,230
Dancer Fitzgerald Sample
and Cutler Gleason and Chaough.

444
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,472
Fantastic!
Two steamships and a rowboat.

445
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,439
You had to write that down?

446
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,630
There's no pictures.

447
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,315
It's a GM car.
It's got four wheels and an engine.

448
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,393
No, it's totally new.

449
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,512
Go to the library and get me everything
you can on Mustang.

450
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,512
- And Chevy.
- No, forget that.

451
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,910
They know there's been nothing
before Mustang and nothing after it...

452
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,673
but they're hoping it's this.

453
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,594
No one and nothing leaves my office.

454
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,438
How about that?

455
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,398
How 'bout it?

456
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,474
Are you okay?

457
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,517
I just wanted to watch <i>Hazel,</i>
but I can't get any reception.

458
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,397
I think you should go home.

459
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,949
I love how you work every account
like it's make or break.

460
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,952
I need some of that right now.

461
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,032
You've been working plenty.

462
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,311
I have a new way to go.

463
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,313
I'd show it to you, but it's top secret,
and it may be terrible.

464
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,997
Maybe Frank's right.
We should have never dumped Alfa.

465
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,517
It's one thing to want something.
It's another to need it.

466
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,637
This is your agency.

467
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,559
You're always going to need something.

468
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,717
Don't let Frank Gleason
make you question it.

469
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,837
Well, it's Frank's agency too, Peggy.

470
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,515
And I've been counting
on his paintbrush and his negativity...

471
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,557
to balance me out for 20 years.

472
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,994
Fine.

473
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,997
But... I've spent a lot of time
working with pessimistic people...

474
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,073
and I like the fact that you're-

475
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,873
Do not say I'm nice.

476
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,236
I hate it when people say I'm nice.

477
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,309
I was going to say strong.

478
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,237
I'm sorry.

479
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,191
I'm just grateful.

480
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,077
No, of course.

481
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,472
Good night, Peggy.

482
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,038
Yes.

483
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,952
Good night.

484
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,872
Hold that.

485
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,559
I got it.

486
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,675
You want to go celebrate?
I just quit my job.

487
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,992
What? Really?

488
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,756
I had a heart and a kid who needed
the heart, and now they're both dead.

489
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,832
I'm not gonna get the opportunity.

490
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,593
I'm tired of fighting.

491
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,992
Well, you're fighting God in a way.

492
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,039
Bullshit.
You don't think God's in Houston?

493
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,920
My hospital chickened out...

494
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,038
and now some asshole down there
is taking my place in history...

495
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,351
while I piss away my life
in New York City.

496
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,239
You can't think that way.

497
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,198
Fate hasn't chosen me.

498
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,794
Look...

499
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,355
I don't cut people open,
but I don't believe in fate.

500
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,955
You make your own opportunities.

501
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,957
You sure you don't want to go for a drink?

502
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,794
I got work.

503
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,752
- How'd it go?
- I don't know.

504
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,559
I was gonna sleep on it...

505
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,951
but now I think
I'm just gonna shower and go back in.

506
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,231
I love you like this.

507
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,118
Desperate and scared?

508
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,590
Fearless.

509
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,592
And I want to do whatever I can...

510
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,876
to make sure you do not fail.

511
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,555
Then you can jump from the balcony...

512
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,149
and fly to work like Superman.

513
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,957
Will there be anything else?

514
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,838
No, thank you, Daisy.

515
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,474
Actually, can you get those lugs
from Dancer bumped off the flight?

516
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,000
Roger, I told you,
I can't hurt the company.

517
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,992
They bought most of the seats.

518
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,353
Jesus, there's like eight of them.

519
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,837
Surprised to see you here.
Taking your kid to look at colleges?

520
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,230
No, taking him to pick out a car.

521
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,880
When did they add
you guys to the mix?

522
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,519
When they saw your work.

523
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,272
I wish you the best of luck.
In fact, maybe we shouldn't even go.

524
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,636
What are the billings for Vicks?
Nine million?

525
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,710
Someone's gonna pick that up.

526
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,232
Any of you have a cough drop?

527
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,710
I know they don't.

528
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,956
Get him on the phone right now,
or I'm coming over there!

529
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,872
I've got it, Clara.

530
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,997
Roger's calling from the airport.

531
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,514
He says something happened
with Vick Chemical.

532
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,990
Tell my father-in-law I am not joking!

533
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,912
Believe me. You do not
want me in your lobby.

534
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,912
Let me talk to Roger.

535
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,798
So it's true?

536
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,076
No, I'm gonna fix it.

537
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,755
- Jesus, they don't need to hear this right now.
- Roger will handle it.

538
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,320
- Well?
- They're screwing with us.

539
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,274
Really?

540
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,113
Daisy's gonna lose their luggage.

541
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,189
Well, apparently you didn't
get any of my calls.

542
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,873
So I came down here to your lair.

543
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,590
Spare me the outrage, Pete.
I'm tired of it.

544
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,440
Tom, what are you doing?

545
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
I know we're both
emotional and vulnerable...

546
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,719
but I'm not the enemy here.

547
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,917
I'm an adult, as are you.

548
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,557
And if anything, our relationship
has shown over the last seven years...

549
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,553
that I have a very short memory.

550
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:38,237
Now, what can I do
to bring you back to reality...

551
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,630
in this obviously impulsive decision?

552
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,677
My daughter is a princess.

553
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,717
She could have had anyone.

554
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,435
I knew there was a reason
you never wanted children.

555
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,513
You have no business being a father.

556
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,757
You just pressed the button, Tom.

557
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,672
You just blew everything up.

558
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,912
Well, it makes me sick
thinking about the man I saw...

559
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,356
being with my daughter
and my granddaughter.

560
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,113
Why don't you look in the mirror?

561
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,112
You can walk out like a man...

562
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,193
or I can have you thrown out
like the lowlife you are.

563
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,357
If I have as low character as you say,
why would you push me like this?

564
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,159
You'll do the right thing.

565
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,232
The paint fumes are making me sick.

566
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,794
I got the windows open.

567
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,633
It'll be dry in a couple of days.

568
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,600
And when am I gonna be able to walk around
my apartment in bare feet?

569
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,353
Soon. We're fixing it up.

570
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,160
In here, yes. But out there?

571
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,311
Those kids are living on our stoop...

572
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,598
lighting firecrackers
and playing their music.

573
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,478
And you keep waving to them.

574
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,997
Look, the neighborhood's changing.
We're a part of that.

575
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,198
I don't like change.
I want everything to stay the way it was.

576
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,990
I don't think you understand, babe.
Everything's getting better.

577
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,437
Johnson's gone. The war is gonna end.

578
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,517
We're gonna have a new president,
no matter what.

579
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,593
Maybe McCarthy. Worst case, Kennedy.

580
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,432
I love Bobby Kennedy.

581
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,398
Fine.

582
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,437
If that's what you want.

583
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,870
I just want you to kiss me.

584
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,073
Damn it.

585
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,353
Hello to you too.

586
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,830
What the hell
are you doing in Detroit?

587
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,192
My doctor recommended an ocean voyage.

588
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,476
Can I get one of those?

589
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,073
I don't believe this.

590
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,359
I spent six weeks on this pipe dream,
and it's gonna be over in two seconds.

591
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,072
Hell, I knew I was good, but I didn't know
all I had to do was show up.

592
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,311
You don't know what this means?

593
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,597
It's not my job to put you at ease...

594
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,798
but just because they brought us in at
the last second doesn't mean you're dead.

595
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,792
Me? We're both dead.

596
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,993
I've had enough
psychological warfare today.

597
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,839
- Why don't you take a table?
- Think about it.

598
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,799
When it's two top 10 agencies and me,
I've got a chance.

599
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,554
Now that there's two little guys,
we're D.O.A.

600
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,155
I'm not worried. I've got great work.

601
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,278
Of course you do.
And mine's even better, I guarantee.

602
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,874
You know how this works.

603
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,158
They're gonna take our creative
and give it to one of the big boys.

604
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,517
Second place, tied with last.

605
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,195
Come on. You know I'm right.

606
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,919
So they want a name brand.

607
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,912
- We had a car.
- So did we.

608
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,152
It's not the same thing.

609
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,637
It's the size of the team.
It's opening an office in Detroit.

610
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,279
This is General Motors.

611
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,431
They fight the war
with bodies on the ground.

612
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,912
I saw Dancer at the airport.

613
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,271
Looked like half my office.

614
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,355
This business is rigged.

615
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,438
Damn it.

616
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,230
That's what I said. Sorry about that.

617
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,394
I'm tired of this crap.

618
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,240
I should just let Chevy buy my brain
and put it in a jar.

619
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,118
Can I get another?

620
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,078
Brain in a jar.

621
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,197
Put it on your tombstone.

622
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:12,118
"Here lies SCDP,
the little company with the big ideas."

623
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,114
"CGC, giving away creative
one car at a time."

624
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,797
So what did you go with?

625
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,952
What, I show you mine, you show me yours?

626
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,509
What's the difference at this point?

627
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,796
You first.

628
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,872
Okay, but I gotta stand up.

629
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,232
This is a car for the young
and the young at heart.

630
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,994
Because today nobody knows
where they're headed...

631
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,151
but they're not afraid
of what's around the bend.

632
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,392
Power plus design equals adventure.

633
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,871
Throw the map out the window
and hit the road,Jack.

634
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,474
Then I sing the song.

635
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,030
- That's good.
- No kidding.

636
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,120
Just music. People's faces.

637
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,398
All kinds- teenagers, dads, moms.

638
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,120
Different expressions of wonder.

639
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,954
What could this possibly be?

640
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,679
It's so new...

641
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,438
this combination of power,
technology, comfort and price...

642
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,718
that it's impossible to imagine.

643
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,675
But not at Chevy.

644
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,558
The future...

645
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,394
is something you haven't
even thought of yet.

646
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,679
You run that for a week.

647
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,911
Then you finally show the car.

648
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,437
That's interesting.

649
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,512
Hooray.

650
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,072
So should we go home?

651
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,234
"We."

652
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,834
That's interesting.

653
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,709
Why, you want to stay just so
Chevy can put a feather in your cap?

654
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,793
I have a better idea.

655
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,271
No, you don't. I just heard it.
This is why everyone hates you.

656
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,157
Think about it.

657
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,472
Both of us have the creative...

658
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,598
but neither of us have an agency to match.

659
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,279
Why would I do that?

660
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,716
Because we're dead.

661
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,232
Even if I were to consider that,
Chevy calls the shots.

662
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,234
Hey, Lieutenant,
want to get into some trouble?

663
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,072
How would that even work?

664
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,676
Well, one of us, probably me...

665
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,434
will have to figure out
a way to make Chevy...

666
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,352
think it was their idea
to combine our agencies.

667
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,512
And then the other one-
let's say it was you-

668
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,990
will have to figure out
what the hell we're gonna present.

669
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,396
Well, <i>we</i> have partners.

670
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,116
Who aren't sitting in this bar.

671
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,959
Can I get another?

672
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,396
No, we're done.

673
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,117
We've got a long night.

674
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,354
I want to make it clear.
Unless this works, I'm against it.

675
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,352
I was just saying the same thing.

676
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,755
Shall we?

677
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,354
After you.

678
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,760
You're not supposed to be here
till the weekend.

679
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,718
I don't like you surprising me.

680
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,837
Sit down, Trudy.

681
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,478
Did you know your father
pulled his business?

682
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,279
No.

683
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,317
And I don't care, Peter.

684
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,474
You understand that we were going to be
very rich, but he's ruined that.

685
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,836
He's done everything for you.

686
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,151
He's a hypocrite, Trudy.

687
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,709
Don't you dare criticize my father.

688
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,831
I guess it doesn't matter
that I caught him in a midtown whorehouse.

689
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,230
Just stop it right now.

690
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,313
It's true.
With a 200-pound Negro prostitute.

691
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,392
Ask him to his face.

692
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,917
You'll say anything to hurt me, won't you?

693
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,232
He wanted it this way.
He left me no other choice.

694
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,789
You had lots of choices, Peter.

695
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,872
We're done. Get your things.

696
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,596
<i>Mr. Chaough wants to seeyou.</i>

697
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,280
- He's back?
<i>- That's all I know.</i>

698
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,638
So, how'd it go?

699
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,078
We got it. We won Chevy.

700
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,593
What are you doing here?

701
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,637
We went in together.

702
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,473
What?

703
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,279
What are you talking about?

704
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,797
They wanted our ideas and a big agency,
so we gave them both.

705
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,318
Just for Chevy?

706
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,440
No, we merged-
furniture, fixtures, everything.

707
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,280
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

708
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,791
I did this wrong once before...

709
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,190
so let me tell you
how great it's going to be...

710
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,476
and you can decide
if you want to come along.

711
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,111
You are the copy chief at one
of the top 25 ad agencies in the country.

712
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,835
You're not even 30. <i>I'm</i> jealous.

713
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,157
I just bought an apartment.

714
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,153
Congratulations.

715
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,392
Are we moving?

716
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,632
We are, and we'd like you
to write the press release.

717
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,920
For what?

718
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,071
We don't have a name yet...

719
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:53,154
but make it sound like
the agency you want to work for.

720
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,311
Who do I give it to?

721
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,113
Give it to Ted.

722
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,159
<i>New York City, May 17, 1968.</i>

723
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,391
<i>For immediate release.</i>
