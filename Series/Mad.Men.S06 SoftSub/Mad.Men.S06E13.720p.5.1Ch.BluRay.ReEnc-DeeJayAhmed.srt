1
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,912
- Morning.
- Don.

2
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,514
Can I have a moment?

3
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,880
I know you're deciding who's gonna be
on Sunkist, so I wanted to volunteer.

4
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,555
You want to go?
You know that's a demotion.

5
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,751
You'll be in one room
with one account.

6
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,351
Thought about that, but rather than
just being a satellite office...

7
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,671
I was thinking I could
turn it into a little agency.

8
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,717
Los Angeles is not what
you see in the movies.

9
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,712
It's like Detroit with palm trees.

10
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,393
So it's the frontier.

11
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,995
I don't even need running water.
Just let me set up the homestead.

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,472
You think you're asking for a promotion...

13
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,119
but if you fail there,
you'll be out of advertising...

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,112
because no one takes it seriously.

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,113
All I'm saying is that
I think it'd be exciting...

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,079
to build one desk into a real business.

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,873
That's not the way I saw it.

18
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,838
That's not the way you saw <i>me.</i>

19
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,479
And you're gonna change that.

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,957
I've always felt you learn more from
disappointment than you do from success.

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,157
Well, I suppose I'm becoming
a very wise man.

22
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,596
- Hello, Daddy.
- How are you doing, sweetie?

23
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,869
Oh? Well.

24
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,996
He did get my good side.

25
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,792
He made it for his generous Pop Pop.

26
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,439
Why don't we take you to lunch?

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,029
Come on, honey,
I've taken up enough of Dad's time.

28
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,876
I wanted to say thank you...

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,717
but obviously that would be premature.

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,191
It's time to take a breather.
It's prudent investing, it's not personal.

31
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,273
No, it is personal. I'm your daughter.

32
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,920
What do I have to do to get on the list
of girls you give money to?

33
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,474
- Honey.
- Don't be a brat.

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,439
Brooks won't say it,
but you're taking food out of our mouths.

35
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,639
Don't even bother to come to Thanksgiving.
The table will be empty.

36
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,076
Stop it. I'll buy a turkey.

37
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,231
Sir, she doesn't mean it.

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,073
<i>Mr. Cosgrove is here.</i>

39
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,879
Send him in.

40
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,797
- Name a chocolate.
- What? Like Hershey's?

41
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,834
Kenny, there's a reason I'm standing here.

42
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,992
Hershey's Chocolate sent an RFP out
to the top 30 agencies...

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,720
and all anyone seems to care about
is that we're in the top 30.

44
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,871
Because Hershey's isn't serious.

45
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,872
They don't advertise. They never have.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,071
Mars bills at 10 million.

47
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,277
We think Hershey's is asking for someone
to talk them into that.

48
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,476
What did Ted say?

49
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,200
He said his plate is full
and yours isn't.

50
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,920
But if you want to take the lead on this,
I think he'll follow.

51
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,316
I love Hershey's. Get me in a room.

52
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,993
I'll get you what they sent me.

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,795
How's the Motor City?

54
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,395
I found a deli,
but the airport's like Calcutta.

55
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,837
Should be easier once I get an apartment
and stop commuting.

56
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,515
- It's a hell of an account.
- Don't I know it.

57
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,074
You're back in one piece.

58
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,277
Oh, one bigger piece.
I'm putting on weight.

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,920
- No one can see it.
- What's that?

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,832
- It's a racehorse.
- It's for Kevin.

61
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,116
Don't do that.
He's just gonna want a real one.

62
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,840
We'll see. They just gave Bob one.

63
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,079
Well, you know what
they say about Detroit.

64
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,039
It's all fun and games
till they shoot you in the face.

65
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,114
Aren't we going to have dinner?

66
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,873
Eventually.

67
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,840
I'm worried. Now they sent a letter.
Sally has to call them.

68
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,074
I'll talk to her at Thanksgiving.

69
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,755
I told you. We just have the boys.

70
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,355
Miss Porter's doesn't have
Thanksgiving vacation.

71
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,353
I read the letter.
The next step's a subpoena.

72
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,193
Okay.

73
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,679
Hello.

74
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,190
You can have <i>one.</i>
Then we're having dinner.

75
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,354
Sounds like a plan.

76
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,837
Could you get Bob Benson for me?

77
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,991
<i>Bob Benson's here to see you.</i>

78
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,715
Really? Send him in.

79
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,518
Were you circling my office?

80
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,312
- I don't understand.
- Sit down.

81
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,755
It occurred to me that you haven't had
a performance review.

82
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,593
Yes, I did.
Didn't Mr. Cutler tell you-

83
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,154
I don't give a shit.

84
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,118
You have a hand on every rung, don't you?

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,912
I don't think I know
what you're talking about.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,310
What are you doing
buying presents for that kid?

87
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,199
Leading that woman on?
That's another man's kid. You know that?

88
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,240
I assure you, I'm not involved with Joan.
We're just buddies.

89
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,879
Joan's known for having a lot of buddies.
They go fishing together.

90
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,156
What does this have to do
with my performance?

91
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,278
I'm asking the questions here.
I see what you're up to.

92
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,719
Look, I know that you're concerned
with your career...

93
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,792
and Chevy's counting on you
being a family man...

94
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,238
but playing with Mrs. Harris's feelings
is not the right way to go about it.

95
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,996
You're right.

96
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,596
Damn it, Bob, I better not be.
I'm keeping an eye on you.

97
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,320
I appreciate your candor.

98
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,632
I'm looking forward to having you
out in Detroit, Bob.

99
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,280
Yes, sir. Thank you.

100
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,871
This is Sally Draper speaking.

101
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,917
It's Daddy.

102
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,354
What do you want?

103
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,353
I wanted to wish you a happy Thanksgiving.

104
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,397
Okay. I have to go.

105
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,393
Also, I'm calling because...

106
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,314
well, I know it's unpleasant...

107
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,869
but you have to give a statement
regarding the burglar.

108
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,476
<i>You need to make arrangements
to be out of classes December 1.</i>

109
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,074
My calendar's full.

110
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,517
Honey, you have to. It's the law.

111
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,678
Well, I wouldn't want
to do anything immoral.

112
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,553
You know what?
Why don't you just tell them what I saw?

113
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,994
Hello?

114
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,516
I've got it, Moira.
I have a personal plea.

115
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,273
Is this about Hershey again?

116
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,556
No, the folks from
Sheraton are in the lobby.

117
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,197
Royal Hawaiian. We can't find Draper.

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,320
Again?

119
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,034
You don't have to listen,
but I have to say it.

120
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,351
We're all brothers in Christ.

121
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,113
That's His gift to us.

122
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,876
We're talking about a fellowship
far more powerful than drink.

123
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,112
Can you keep it down? I'm trying to drink.

124
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,392
What's your occupation, young man?

125
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,920
Staying out of people's business.

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,310
You're not doing a very good job of it.

127
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,511
I didn't mean to engage you.

128
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,435
But you did.
'Cause something's on your mind.

129
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,191
You need to talk.

130
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,794
I don't.

131
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,040
What if I told you that Jesus
could offer you not only eternal life...

132
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,079
but freedom from pain in this life?

133
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,872
I'm doing just fine.
Nixon's the president.

134
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,031
Everything's back where Jesus wants it.

135
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,396
He doesn't work that way.

136
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,075
'Cause He's mysterious.

137
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,311
He offer the same deal to Kennedy?

138
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,313
Martin Luther King?
Vietnam, for Christ's sake?

139
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,319
Studies show Jesus had a... bad year.

140
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,034
Well, I'm afraid there's not one true
believer in that list.

141
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,113
What the hell did you just say?

142
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,034
I told you before to get out
and not come back.

143
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,760
- Be on your way.
- This is a house of sin.

144
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,991
You can't keep these girls
from the righteous path.

145
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,720
- They belong to the Lord.
- You're wrong on that.

146
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,031
You love the Bible
'cause you can't get your dick hard.

147
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,157
Repentance is your salvation.

148
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,790
I'd tell you to go to hell, but I never
want to see you again.

149
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,677
The only unpardonable sin
is to believe God cannot forgive you.

150
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,676
Excuse me. Hey.

151
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,400
- I shouldn't be in here.
- You're right.

152
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,154
You punched a minister.
You should be in Rikers.

153
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,833
Sleep it off.

154
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,034
Absolutely not!
You'll have candy at the theater.

155
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,198
- Oh, hello, Peggy.
- Hello.

156
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,069
Good night.

157
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,274
Come on, boys. Let's go.

158
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,235
Clara, I'm going to give my keys
to the subletter.

159
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,674
Did you get me a room
at the Roosevelt?

160
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,353
Yes, and you just got this telegram.

161
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,874
Open it.

162
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,152
Let's see.

163
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,039
"Need to inform you, mother lost at-"

164
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,080
Oh, my goodness. She fell off a ship!

165
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,075
What?

166
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,594
Get Bud on the phone.

167
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,916
I assume this has something
to do with last night.

168
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,720
Yes.

169
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,440
Megan, I-

170
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,197
Come over here.

171
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,071
Where were you?

172
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,556
I spent the night in jail.

173
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,277
Why are you laughing?

174
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,999
Because I realized...

175
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,877
it's gotten out of control.

176
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,952
I've gotten out of control.

177
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,597
Sorry you had to find out that way.

178
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,120
But I realized something else too.

179
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,797
I don't want to be here anymore.

180
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,711
- It'll get easier.
- No.

181
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,919
I want to move to California.

182
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,556
What?

183
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,395
I don't want you to give up your career.
I don't want you to think that.

184
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,558
I just can't be in New York anymore.

185
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,632
I want to move to LA.

186
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,040
I don't-

187
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,792
I don't know what to say.

188
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,999
There have been all these
opportunities in Hollywood...

189
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,710
but I never even considered it...

190
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,996
because I thought it
would make you go crazy.

191
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,833
But- I mean, wouldn't it?

192
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,033
What would you do out there?

193
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,515
Sunkist wants us to have someone local.

194
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,192
It would be like having my own shop.

195
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,516
A small team, a desk...

196
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,876
windows, some sunlight, the ocean.

197
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,837
You'd throw everything away here.

198
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,593
No.

199
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,998
It's an opportunity to build one desk...

200
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,959
into an agency.

201
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,039
We'd be homesteaders.

202
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,437
Really, Don?

203
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,199
What about the kids?

204
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,680
I'm sure they'd trade weekends
for a whole summer in LA.

205
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,679
We were happy there.

206
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,873
We could be happy again.

207
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,720
Is that a yes?

208
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,160
This was to be a junior position.

209
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,312
Look, I'm the search party,
and I decided we were thinking too small.

210
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,238
Well, I think we can spare you.

211
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,473
I apologize for Sheraton, Ted.
That won't happen again.

212
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,599
That's my recommendation.
Of course I welcome a vote on the matter.

213
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,270
How is it every decision
made in this place...

214
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,477
is subject to 10 opinions unless it's him?

215
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,074
What if we need him here?

216
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,476
It's California, not the moon.

217
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,755
There are telephones and airplanes.

218
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,151
You're already doing the heavy lifting.
This is good for you, Ted.

219
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,519
Honestly, I have
bigger problems than this.

220
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,116
Dawn, could you bring me
a carton of cigarettes?

221
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,954
You didn't think ahead.

222
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,191
You let her go, and yet
you still need something.

223
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,840
- She's not going anywhere.
- But you are.

224
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,594
California, here you come.

225
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,550
You probably dictated the memo right to her
and had no idea she'd be affected.

226
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,438
Hold on a second.

227
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,640
I was gonna talk to you.

228
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,514
Really? Why? You don't owe me anything.

229
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,195
I can probably get you
out there eventually.

230
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,114
To work for you?
Nah, I'd rather stay here.

231
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,554
Where are you going?

232
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,916
I'm gonna have that sandwich on my desk.
I need to get to it before you do.

233
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,717
Are you kidding me? They got married?

234
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,837
What the hell was he even doing there?

235
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,079
You should really get going.

236
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,272
You tell those Panamanian criminals they
should put Manolo under house arrest!

237
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,477
Or ship's arrest or whatever it's called.

238
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,516
Fine, the brig. Do whatever it takes.

239
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,235
- What's wrong?
- Get me Bob Benson this minute.

240
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,630
He was waiting for you.
You're late for your flight to Detroit.

241
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,230
Hold that.

242
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,159
- How are you?
- Not great, Bob.

243
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,119
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

244
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,680
Don't play dumb.

245
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,229
You don't know that your boyfriend Manolo
kidnapped my mother...

246
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,596
married her at gunpoint,
then threw her off a ship?

247
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,515
Slow down. I know you're exaggerating,
and you're being hostile.

248
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,319
If you want to run, I'd do it now.

249
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,198
Because you're an accessory to murder!

250
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,079
I will never, ever let this go.

251
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,311
Manny wouldn't hurt a fly.

252
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,073
Even if he thought it was rich?

253
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,672
I swear I knew nothing about this.

254
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,275
Ignorance will not be
a very good defense.

255
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,754
Get your own cab.

256
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,751
I'm leaving a little early
because I have plans.

257
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,479
I hope that's okay.

258
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,116
Yes, of course, dear.

259
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,313
Chanel No. 5?

260
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,073
It's all I wear.

261
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,952
Vixen by night.

262
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,672
I'm very excited to see the scale model.

263
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,275
And I'm even more excited
to go to the London Chop House.

264
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,033
Bob loves it.

265
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,277
Well, unfortunately
Bob's not feeling well.

266
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,755
Pete, have you seen this beauty?

267
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,715
No, not in the flesh.

268
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,555
- That's a Camaro Z28. Am I wrong?
- No, you are not.

269
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,030
I like a man with gasoline in his veins.

270
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,679
You've got to try it.

271
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,433
We can't do that in here.

272
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,591
I did. Last week.

273
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,070
Shit, it's our floor.
We can do whatever the hell we want.

274
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,310
Keys are under the visor.

275
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,479
Go to town.

276
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,953
Bobby, you like to get
into trouble, don't you?

277
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,675
It's standard.

278
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,992
So is the solid-lifter 302 V-8.

279
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,795
Listen to that music.

280
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,440
That's good enough for me.

281
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,319
Ah, take it out. Come on, boys, back up.

282
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,916
You looking for first?
It's written right on there.

283
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,514
I got it, Bob.

284
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,435
Jesus, you can't drive a stick?

285
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,352
We'll pay for that.

286
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,752
What are you doing here?

287
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,320
Waiting for you.

288
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,552
I told your neighbors I was a cop.

289
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,437
You should go home before they kill you.

290
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,953
I need to talk to you.

291
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,754
How was your date?

292
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,354
Is that why you're here?

293
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,032
I just want to know.

294
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,713
You didn't bring him home.

295
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,518
It was terrible, okay?

296
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,399
He works in finance
and ate with his hands.

297
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,437
Not that it's any of your business.

298
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,834
I don't know what we're doing.

299
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,354
You don't know?

300
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,716
Why don't you have your wife
drop by again? I'd love that.

301
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,190
She came in with the kids.

302
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,239
Why did she give me that look
on the way out?

303
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,875
Did you tell her something?
Do you two talk about me?

304
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,111
I don't know why women do anything.

305
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,436
Why did you parade your ass
in front of my door...

306
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,318
on your way out to see another man?

307
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,710
I'm following your lead, Ted.

308
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,396
You let Don terrify you into ignoring me,
and now you're here.

309
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,949
Because I don't want
anyone else to have you.

310
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,200
You should go.

311
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,997
Peggy, I'm going to leave my wife.

312
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,637
Don't say that.

313
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm not that girl.

314
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,000
I love you.

315
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,435
Hello?

316
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,916
I just got off the phone
with Miss Porter's.

317
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,912
Sally's been suspended.

318
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,594
What did she do?

319
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,151
She bought beer using
the name "Beth Francis"...

320
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,033
with a false ID she'd made.

321
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,790
Kids do things, Betty.
At least they didn't kick her out.

322
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,317
Henry's already in Albany.
I'm supposed to join him tomorrow.

323
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,314
I know you're picking
the boys up Thanksgiving Day...

324
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,993
but could you go get her tomorrow?

325
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,912
They're holding her in the infirmary.

326
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,555
I don't want to have this conversation
with my mother-in-law.

327
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,752
I can't, Betty. I have a big meeting.

328
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,752
She was drunk.

329
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,638
And she got other girls drunk.

330
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,117
I've done everything I can think to do,
everything my own mother did...

331
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,592
<i>and it doesn't matter.</i>

332
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,990
The good is not beating the bad.

333
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,280
She obviously needs
more than I can give her.

334
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,357
Birdie, this isn't your fault.

335
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,230
Don, she's from a broken home.

336
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,198
Pauline doesn't need to know.

337
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,156
I'll come get them Thanksgiving morning,
and then I'll come get her.

338
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,479
Okay.

339
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,389
I'm sorry.

340
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,511
Is everything okay?

341
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,080
No.

342
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,550
Is there anything I can do?

343
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,559
Let's go to Hawaii.

344
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,673
For work?

345
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,510
For Christmas.
We'll come back with tans.

346
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,870
You should probably go home.

347
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,520
I don't want to.

348
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,759
I can say I worked late on Hershey.

349
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,194
Don't you always go home, though?

350
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,319
I don't want to sneak around.

351
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,752
I promise we won't have to.

352
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,199
I don't want a scandal.
I can wait.

353
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,510
Go.

354
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,715
No, you should go.

355
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,672
Oh, good, you're home.

356
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,752
Yeah, I didn't want to wake you.

357
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,759
- Oh, come to bed.
- Okay.

358
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,794
Oh, sweetheart, you're working too hard.

359
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,517
What are you doing back?

360
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,592
- You haven't heard?
- Heard what?

361
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,074
I need a place to live.

362
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,072
I spoke with the GM
personnel department.

363
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,880
No, here in New York.

364
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,555
I'm done in Detroit,
and the tenant's already moved in.

365
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,994
Oh.

366
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,309
Your brother's been trying
desperately to reach you.

367
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,119
Did they find her?

368
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,357
Well, let him know I'm back.

369
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,112
I'm gonna be gone for a couple of hours.

370
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,596
Roger needs me to go to the bank
before the holiday.

371
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,034
You want someone on his desk?

372
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,550
I'm not sure he's coming in.

373
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,359
I'm worried about him.

374
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,840
What's wrong?

375
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,435
For one thing, Margaret and the son-in-law
are bleeding him dry.

376
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,671
Trust me. He loves it.

377
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,674
Well, he's forlorn. I'd invite him
to my place for Thanksgiving...

378
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,998
but Ralph stopped drinking
and you know little Ralphie's spastic.

379
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,151
I think both are too much for him.

380
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,352
<i>Mr. Draper.
Mr. Chaough's here to see you.</i>

381
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,272
Send him in.

382
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,316
- I need to talk to you.
- I was thinking the same thing.

383
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,517
You should come to Hershey's
since I'm going to California.

384
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,034
That's not why I'm here.

385
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,555
Do you want something?

386
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,080
No, thank you.

387
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,878
I don't know how to say this,
but I want to go to California.

388
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,510
Really? We can't both go.

389
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,829
I know.

390
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,273
I want you to stay here.

391
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,195
You put all that energy and optimism
back into the business...

392
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,959
and let me go out there.

393
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,637
I'm the one who needs to start over.

394
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,430
With Peggy?

395
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,912
No, with my family.

396
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,199
I don't understand.

397
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,953
Yes, you do.

398
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,997
It's my only chance, Don.

399
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,433
I've got kids.

400
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,432
I can't throw this away. I can't-

401
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,512
I can't go on like this.

402
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,477
I'm sorry, Ted. I wish I could help you.

403
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,639
I don't know what I brought out in you...

404
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,957
but I know
there's a good man in there.

405
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,920
I need you to help me
put 3,000 miles between me and her...

406
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,753
or <i>my</i> life is over.

407
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,275
I didn't make my decision lightly.

408
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,199
I need it too.

409
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,478
And, frankly,
they're writing my wife off her show.

410
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,597
It's too late, Ted.

411
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,313
It <i>will</i> go away.

412
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,115
Will you have a drink before the meeting?

413
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,032
My father was-
You can't stop cold like that.

414
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,274
Every agency you're going to meet with
feels qualified to advertise the Hershey bar...

415
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:05,158
because the product itself is one of
the most successful billboards of all time.

416
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,309
And its relationship with America
is so overwhelmingly positive...

417
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,915
that everyone in this room
has their own story to tell.

418
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,953
It could be rations in the heat of battle
or in the movie theater on a first date.

419
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,756
But most of them are from childhood.

420
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,352
Mine was my father...

421
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,080
taking me to the drugstore
after I'd mowed the lawn...

422
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,958
and telling me I could
have anything I wanted.

423
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,874
Anything at all. And there was a lot.

424
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,394
But I picked a Hershey bar.

425
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,755
The wrapper looked like what was inside.

426
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,516
And as I ripped it open,
my father tousled my hair and forever...

427
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,231
his love and the chocolate
were tied together.

428
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,915
That's the story we're going to tell.

429
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,960
Hershey's is the currency of affection.

430
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,031
It's the childhood symbol of love.

431
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,273
Well, weren't you a lucky little boy?

432
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,831
Our company excels in television...

433
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,197
and we'll tell you exactly when and where
to tell those stories.

434
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,079
Sweet tales of childhood.

435
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,556
I suppose we'd start with yours.

436
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,836
You can't just have that.
You got to pay us first.

437
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,796
And that's what's so exciting.

438
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,954
I'm sorry. I have to say this...

439
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,680
'cause I don't know
if I'll ever see you again.

440
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,154
What?

441
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,993
I was an orphan.

442
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,477
I grew up in Pennsylvania...

443
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,639
in a whorehouse.

444
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,395
I read about Milton Hershey
and his school...

445
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,394
in <i>Coronet</i> magazine or some other crap
the girls left by the toilet.

446
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:15,191
And I read that some orphans...

447
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,351
had a different life there.

448
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,078
I could picture it. I dreamt of it-

449
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,473
Of being wanted.

450
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,595
Because the woman
who was forced to raise me...

451
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,560
would look at me every day
like she hoped I would disappear.

452
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,958
Closest I got to feeling wanted
was from a girl...

453
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,717
who made me go through
her johns's pockets while they screwed.

454
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,194
If I collected more than a dollar,
she'd buy me a Hershey bar.

455
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,239
And I would eat it... alone,
in my room...

456
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,353
with great ceremony...

457
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,951
feeling like a normal kid.

458
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,197
It said "sweet" on the package.

459
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,675
It was the only sweet thing in my life.

460
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,710
Do you want to advertise that?

461
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,599
If I had my way,
you would never advertise.

462
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,518
You shouldn't have someone like me
telling that boy what a Hershey bar is.

463
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,193
He already knows.

464
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,872
Don's being modest.

465
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,911
But it's just this kind of theater that
makes our work so different.

466
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,152
Well, that's quite a story.

467
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,074
It was a pleasure meeting you.

468
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,040
We'd love to have a meal...

469
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,879
stop you from going to
some of these other meetings.

470
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,838
Ted?

471
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,479
- It was a pleasure.
- Yes.

472
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,759
You're going to California.

473
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,033
Are you sure?

474
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,679
I want you to.

475
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,994
Thank you.

476
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,159
Dawn, get my things.

477
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,991
You know, you shit the bed in there.

478
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,117
- I don't care.
- Was any of that true?

479
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,232
Yes. I have to go home.

480
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,759
Happy Thanksgiving, sweetheart.

481
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,352
You, too, Mr. Draper.

482
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,874
<i>It occurred during
the roaring '20s dinner dance...</i>

483
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,270
<i>so your mother likely went
missing over the promenade.</i>

484
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,079
<i>It's the only way
she wouldn't have hit a deck below.</i>

485
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,038
No, where was the boat?

486
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,396
<i>Oh, somewhere off the coast of Martinique.</i>

487
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,119
Did they check the beaches?

488
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,194
<i>- First of all, there are a lot of sharks.</i>
- Dear Lord.

489
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,478
<i>As I said, there's no impetus for either
government to investigate...</i>

490
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,713
<i>and the</i> SS Sunset Princess <i>in
contacting you has fulfilled its obligation.</i>

491
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,996
It's 1968.

492
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,753
Surely you're not telling me...

493
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,392
there's still some international oceanic
limbo where murder is smiled upon.

494
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,279
<i>I have a private investigator
prepared to board the ship...</i>

495
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,920
<i>and locate your mother's husband-
well, nurse-</i>

496
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,674
<i>Manolo Colón, alias Marcus Constantine.</i>

497
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,036
<i>We also have wheels
we can grease in Panama.</i>

498
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,192
<i>No stone unturned, no expense spared.</i>

499
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,915
Let's say we want
the very best of everything.

500
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,157
- What are the expenses?
<i>- To bring your mother's killer to justice?</i>

501
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,754
Ballpark.

502
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,354
<i>It may take time.</i>

503
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,275
<i>Now that Manolo's aware of her limited
financial resources, he may bolt.</i>

504
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,232
Alvin, I have another call coming in.

505
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,437
Can we continue this later?

506
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,993
When you think about it...

507
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,754
it won't bring her back.

508
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,395
She's in the water with Father.

509
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,999
She loved the sea.

510
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,234
I didn't want to disturb you.

511
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,479
What happened?

512
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,157
I don't even know how to say this.

513
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,471
Did you tell Nan?

514
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,916
Did you confess? I told you to wait.

515
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,036
No, that's-

516
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,879
I'm going to California.

517
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:29,957
You can stay here and have your life
and your career and let this be the past.

518
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,399
I can't believe Don did this.

519
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,116
I knew he wasn't going.
He knows it's Siberia. I can undo this.

520
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,750
No, Peggy.
He gave up his spot for me.

521
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,796
Don?

522
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,759
I wanted this so much,
but I have a family.

523
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,352
The world out there-

524
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,714
I have to hold onto them
or I'll get lost in the chaos.

525
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,994
Oh.

526
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,680
You have to listen to me.

527
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,235
I love you that deeply.

528
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,799
I can't be around you.

529
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,393
And I can't ruin all those lives.

530
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,120
Get out. Just get out!

531
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,431
Someday you'll be glad
I made this decision.

532
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,434
Well, aren't you lucky...
to have decisions?

533
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,154
Dawn just called.

534
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,631
She said there's a partners' meeting
tomorrow about California.

535
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,394
Attendance is mandatory. 9:00.

536
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,671
You have a meeting on Thanksgiving.

537
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,672
They must really want us out of here fast.

538
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,035
Honey.

539
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,760
- You have to sit down.
- Why?

540
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,993
Because something came up.
And it's not just Sally, it's-

541
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,753
It's what?

542
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,876
I'm sorry, but we can't
go to California right now.

543
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,992
No. Don, that's-

544
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,118
That's not possible
because I already told Mel...

545
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,192
and Jeff Hunter's got me a bunch of
meetings out there...

546
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,670
- and the train is leaving the station.
- The agency decided that-

547
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,195
Fuck the agency! I quit my job!

548
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,236
Megan.

549
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,438
You know what?

550
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,950
I don't even know
why we're fighting for this anymore.

551
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,479
I don't know what it is.

552
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,995
We don't have any kids.

553
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,120
You want to be alone with your liquor
and your ex-wife and your screwed-up kids.

554
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,117
Don't say that.

555
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,797
I love them to death.

556
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,392
I used to feel pity for them...

557
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,154
but now I realize
we're all in the same boat.

558
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,157
I know you're upset.

559
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,079
But I'm gonna be
out there all the time with you.

560
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,280
We'll be bicoastal.

561
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,358
Megan, I love you.

562
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,874
I can't do this.

563
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,640
I can't be here right now.

564
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,193
They'll deliver the lowboy
and the china closet next Friday.

565
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,634
I couldn't take any more and I already
look like the <i>Beverly Hillbillies...</i>

566
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,040
with the chair tied to the roof.

567
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,191
I don't want your mother's things, Peter.

568
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,114
Well, Bud's not getting everything.

569
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,271
And I'm not moving
everything to California with me.

570
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,033
It's fine. I'll manage.

571
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,233
When are you leaving for your parents'?

572
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,198
When Tammy finishes her nap.

573
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,032
When are you leaving for Los Angeles?

574
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,713
Soon as I can.

575
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,360
I'd invite you, but I think it's best
you're alone right now.

576
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,840
Don't be cruel.

577
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,240
No.

578
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,316
It's going to take you
a moment to realize where you are.

579
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,312
You're free.

580
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,915
Free of her. You're free of them.

581
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,911
You're free of everything.

582
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,639
It's not the way I wanted it.

583
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,552
Now you know that.

584
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,680
Can I go in and say good-bye?
I won't wake her.

585
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,080
I was told 9:00.

586
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,720
Right on time. Impressive.

587
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,912
Don, we need to have a serious conversation.
Where would you like to do it?

588
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,959
Is this about the Hershey meeting
yesterday? Because I can explain.

589
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,759
Well, unfortunately, that meeting...

590
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,834
and most of your questionable behavior
is beyond explanation.

591
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,474
Should I sit down?

592
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,358
Yes.

593
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,311
I'm not going to defend myself.

594
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,517
I've tolerated plenty
from every one of you.

595
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,037
Don, there's no need for defense.
This isn't a trial.

596
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,799
The verdict has been reached.

597
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,315
So what time did this meeting start?

598
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,360
We think it's best for you and the firm
if you take some time off and regroup.

599
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,080
- How much time?
- A few months.

600
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,358
But the holidays are coming.
That will take up most of it.

601
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,238
Did you tell Ted?

602
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,391
'Cause he can't go to California if
there's no one here to run New York.

603
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,949
Ted feels confident
he can oversee Peggy from LA.

604
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,157
He knows it's temporary.

605
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,039
I want a return date.

606
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,680
We can't give you that.

607
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,673
You all agree with this?

608
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,752
Try and see it from our side.

609
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,070
- Good morning.
- Hello, Don.

610
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,470
You're early.

611
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,234
Sorry about that, old chum.

612
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,993
This is Lou Avery from Dancer Fitzgerald.

613
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,560
We've met.

614
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,394
Going down?

615
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,794
What's that?

616
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,758
We couldn't send it back.

617
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,755
- Hey.
- What?

618
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,911
Happy holidays.

619
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,310
What's he doing here?

620
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,195
I'm inviting you into Kevin's life,
not mine.

621
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,913
Okay.

622
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,913
Hi, Bob.

623
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,434
Mom, Roger's here.

624
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,239
Gail got her hair done for you.

625
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,760
Hello, little man.

626
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,235
- You ready for some turkey?
- Yes.

627
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,277
Here, let me get it for you.

628
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,271
I thought you left.

629
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,159
No, I've got too much to do.

630
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,759
And you thought you'd do it in here?

631
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,120
It's where everything is.

632
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,439
See you Monday.

633
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,079
Did they name it "Hershey's"
because of the chocolate...

634
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,833
or is the chocolate named after the city?

635
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,751
There was a man named Hershey.

636
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,797
He made enough chocolate to build a town.

637
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,318
Why are we stopping?

638
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,312
This is a bad neighborhood.

639
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,470
Come on.

640
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,633
This is where I grew up.
