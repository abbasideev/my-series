1
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,474
That's it.

2
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,236
- That's it. Hang in there.
- Oh, my God!

3
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,794
Oh, my God.

4
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,110
<i>"Midway in our life's journey...</i>

5
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,040
<i>I went astray from the straight road...</i>

6
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,393
<i>and woke to find myself alone
in a dark wood."</i>

7
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,280
<i>Mahalo.</i>

8
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,711
It's still Suite 282.

9
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,870
How long has it been?

10
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,350
Can't get too suntanned.
They'll fire me.

11
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,199
You must have gotten it wet.
Let me see.

12
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,512
You know what? Who cares what time it is?

13
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,432
You would not have liked that.
You wouldn't have liked it at all.

14
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,513
I had to walk down the beach
away from the crowds to this surf shop...

15
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,235
and knock on a door with a "Closed" sign.

16
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,913
It was so seedy down there.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,879
Plus, I had to get my money from here.

18
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,476
Come on.

19
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,791
I know you've tried it,
but you haven't had sex high.

20
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,111
It makes it so much more intense.

21
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,239
Everything you see on your plate...

22
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,915
is what you would find
in a royal Hawaiian feast.

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,640
That purple pudding is poi.

24
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,918
It's strange, but satisfying.

25
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,799
And we Hawaiians say that it's <i>ono...</i>

26
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,837
which means tasty.

27
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,960
But you might just say,
"Ono, I'm not eating that."

28
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,317
This is real Hawaiian food.
Even the macaroni salad.

29
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,798
But, of course, at the Royal Hawaiian,
we try to treat every guest like they're-

30
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,599
Well, everything is better here.

31
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,239
I'm sure it is.

32
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,676
It must take a lot of work
to stand out in paradise.

33
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,399
Don, you have to try this.

34
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,076
Oh, don't bother. It's wallpaper paste.
Just eat the pig.

35
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,951
Now, while you stay with us
at the lovely, beautiful Royal Hawaiian...

36
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,317
make sure you see
enchanted Diamond Head...

37
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,599
and all of the natural wonders
of the island by bus or by boat.

38
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,192
It's easy if you book
one of our guided tours in the lobby.

39
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,830
Aloha.
Come. Come dance.

40
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,520
- I've got nothing to do with this.
- Go ahead, Don.

41
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,954
Leave him alone, honey.

42
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,509
I want to do it.

43
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,516
Hey.

44
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,117
No, you have to do it like this.

45
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,431
You have to relax.

46
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,080
Get in the spirit of the islands.

47
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,840
They call me the Hawaiian Elvis.

48
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,997
Gentlemen, I remind you, this is my job.

49
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,240
Stop laughing.
I'll make them come back for you.

50
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,435
Thank you.

51
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,432
Excuse me, Corinne. I hate to bother you.

52
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,477
I mean, I know your name's not Corinne.

53
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,359
No, it's, uh, Megan Calvet.

54
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,079
Oh, my goodness.
I'm really bothering you.

55
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,640
No, not at all.

56
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,189
You're so much trimmer than you are on TV.
Do people tell you that?

57
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,956
- I- Um, no.
<i>- To Have and To Hold</i> is my favorite.

58
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,874
I mean, I watch a few,
and you're obviously on vacation.

59
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,076
It's okay.

60
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,153
I know you're new to Berkshire Falls,
but I can tell you...

61
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,197
you just have a way.

62
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,112
Thank you so much.

63
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,556
Would you mind signing
an autograph to my niece?

64
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,518
She's a bigger fan than I am.

65
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,071
- I'd be delighted.
- Oh.

66
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,596
- What's her name?
- Karen.

67
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,751
It's like Corinne.

68
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,759
I can't believe Victor
won't acknowledge you.

69
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,600
Well, we'll see what happens.

70
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,518
Enjoy your stay.

71
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,591
Those women really knew me.

72
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,797
One of them was from Minnesota.

73
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,156
I didn't even know
they had the show there.

74
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,597
I love it here.

75
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,597
Hey, Galloway, you want another?

76
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,352
Can I get a tall beer? Chop, chop.

77
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,392
So, mister, has he moved at all?

78
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,360
Well, you're either dead
or you've got great balance.

79
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,434
Hey, were you in the service?

80
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,194
I got the same one.

81
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,634
What branch?

82
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,995
Army.

83
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,753
You can say that again.

84
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,877
- Korea?
- Briefly.

85
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,270
Was Korea like this?

86
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,637
'Cause I'll tell you,
they offer you R&R in Honolulu...

87
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,873
and you think,
"Did anybody notice it's the same place?"

88
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,429
But I'm glad to be here,
I can tell you that.

89
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,876
You on your anniversary?

90
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,551
Folks have been pretty friendly.

91
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,798
After all the shit that went on
last summer stateside...

92
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,997
I was looking for a fight.

93
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,835
That'd be classy-
showing up with a black eye.

94
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,273
This is my bachelor party.

95
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,232
I'm getting married tomorrow.

96
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,712
Congratulations. Let me buy you a drink.

97
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,520
Nah, I got a shitload of combat pay.

98
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,353
Let me buy you one.

99
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,239
You some kind of astronaut?

100
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,879
I'm in advertising.

101
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,471
We got this.50-caliber machine gun.

102
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,472
The M2.

103
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,800
You should see what it does
to a water buffalo.

104
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,351
Oh, my Lord. I could paint this place red.

105
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,113
How long do you have left?

106
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,590
Ceremony's at 0800.

107
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,354
Four hours or so.

108
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,114
No, in Vietnam.

109
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,680
Eight months.

110
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,229
Someone told her
married guys live longer...

111
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,238
'cause they got something to live for.

112
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,714
She's from San Diego.

113
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,393
She's Mexican.

114
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,115
She met me halfway in Hawaii.

115
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,715
I met her halfway by getting married.

116
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,237
Were you married when you were in Korea?

117
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,471
- No.
- And you made it.

118
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,359
Listen, Lieutenant.

119
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,194
What do you say we get into some trouble?

120
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,077
It's PFC Dinkins, by the way.

121
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,439
It's usually printed right there.

122
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,960
Don.

123
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,755
So how do you feel
about giving away the bride?

124
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,513
You don't think
your friend's gonna make it?

125
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,278
Nah, he's my best man.
Her family's in San Ysidro.

126
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,479
And I don't want some hotel employee
being her dad.

127
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,957
They look just like the enemy.

128
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,514
Am I wrong?

129
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,395
There's plenty of GIs here.
There's no one else you know?

130
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,551
Who gave your bride away?

131
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,156
I'd love to help you out,
but you don't even know me.

132
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,720
I think you'd regret it later.

133
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,838
I believe in what
goes around comes around.

134
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,869
One day, I'm gonna be
a veteran in paradise.

135
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,512
One day, I'll be the man
who can't sleep and talks to strangers.

136
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,151
I, James, take you, Connie,
for my lawful wife...

137
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,438
to have and to hold from this day forward.

138
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,319
For better or for worse,
for richer or for poorer...

139
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,950
in sickness and in health
until death do us part.

140
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,953
What were you doing wrong?

141
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,679
I'm so sorry, Officer.
It's very hard to see.

142
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,434
That's why you have to drive slower.

143
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,240
We go easy on the speed limit here,
but not with this ice.

144
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,800
I promise I will do that in the future.

145
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,678
I'm afraid this is about
what you already did.

146
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,798
You may not be aware,
but this is Betty Francis.

147
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,520
You may know her husband,
my son, Henry Francis.

148
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,638
He works in the mayor's office
in Manhattan. Mayor Lindsay.

149
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,997
I work for New York State.
We've got our own mayor.

150
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,390
I'll do without your sarcasm, young man.

151
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,793
Now, if you don't mind, I think all concerned
will be very content...

152
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,078
if you issue a stern warning
and let us be on our way.

153
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,833
Pauline.

154
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,833
I'm trying to avoid
taking you off the road with a shovel.

155
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,436
She's driving like a maniac.
Yell at her.

156
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,999
I hate cops.

157
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,072
Nonsense. They're just doing their job.

158
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,237
Well, they're too enthusiastic.

159
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,074
That ruined it. That ruined everything.

160
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,675
I can't imagine it getting
any darker than this.

161
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,399
My mom's dead.

162
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,760
How was <i>The Nutcracker?</i>

163
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,594
- The highlight of the evening.
- Magical as always.

164
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,276
Well, Bobby, Gene and I
are sorry we missed it.

165
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,716
Nothing like the ballet, right, boys?

166
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,793
- Is Sandy sleeping over?
- What do you care?

167
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,714
Isn't somebody going to say something?

168
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,191
Betty got a ticket.

169
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,431
For what?

170
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,275
I thought it was going to be speeding,
but apparently it's reckless driving.

171
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,636
I want you to tell your wife
that invoking your name...

172
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,958
in an interaction with a state trooper
is nothing to be ashamed of.

173
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,077
Ma, it barely works for me.

174
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,038
Then Grandma Pauline yelled at him.

175
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,918
I did nothing of the sort.

176
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,038
- What did he do?
- He was verbally abusive.

177
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,476
Give him the ticket. He'll fix it.
He does it for everyone.

178
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,951
Ma, you know how
I fix those tickets? I pay 'em.

179
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,191
- Can I open it?
- Mm-hmm.

180
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,232
Get away, you little weirdo.

181
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,438
I like the case. It looks like a coffin.

182
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,194
Would you play a little? That'd be nice.

183
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,033
I don't know.

184
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,477
Please. It makes me feel so much.

185
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,238
This is disgusting.
Don't let them force you.

186
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,198
Have you been playing long?

187
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,751
- She's going to Juilliard next semester.
- Juilliard?

188
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,992
Why didn't you tell me
we were in the presence of a prodigy?

189
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,311
Fifteen is not a prodigy.

190
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,711
Sorry about that.
Checking the steam.

191
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,757
- How was your trip?
- Wonderful.

192
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,275
Warm. I did not miss this.

193
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,238
How are you feeling?

194
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,589
Let me in there.

195
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,956
It's okay, Jonesy.

196
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,714
- Jesus, what's his real name?
- I don't know.

197
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,598
Open his coat. Open his coat.

198
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,592
Sylvia, call an ambulance.

199
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,512
There's a phone at the desk.

200
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,675
Okay, Jonesy, keep listening to me.

201
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,831
Come on, I know you can hear me.

202
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,760
Come on.

203
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,873
- Let me get those.
- Absolutely not.

204
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,314
I'm surprised you're back at work.

205
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,153
The missus couldn't wait
to get me out of the house.

206
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,709
- I don't believe it.
- Oh, wait.

207
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,520
Messenger came with your script yesterday.

208
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,432
I didn't let it out of my sight.

209
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,831
I got you a pretty nice bottle for Christmas
in case you can't read the handwriting.

210
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,991
Well, I hope you got Dr. Rosen a case.

211
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,077
I thought you were going
to stop reading that before bed.

212
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,879
It's not bothering me tonight.

213
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,111
I bet it isn't.

214
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,796
You're so calm from all that violin.

215
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,553
She plays beautifully.

216
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,712
You and Bobby had the same look
on your face when she was playing.

217
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,996
She's a year older than Sally.
Shame on you.

218
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,198
No one would blame me
for leaving you for a teenage musician.

219
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,351
She's just in the next room.

220
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,830
Why don't you go in there and rape her?

221
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,350
- I'll hold her arms down.
- Betty, what the hell?

222
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,956
You said you wanted to spice things up.
Will it ruin it if I'm there?

223
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,151
You know what?
If you want to be alone with her...

224
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,516
I'll put on my housecoat
and take Sally for a ride.

225
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,956
You can stick a rag in her mouth
and you won't wake the boys.

226
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,952
All right. All right, Betty.

227
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,233
My goodness. You're blushing.

228
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,189
She left the sliding door open.

229
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,073
There's dirt all over the rug.

230
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,038
Maybe she wanted to air out the place.

231
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,715
I'm gonna take the cleaning
out of her Christmas present.

232
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,837
One scene.

233
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,470
I take somebody's coat
and offer them a drink.

234
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,439
You're the maid. It's more than ours does.

235
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,718
One scene, Don.
They send me to pack suitcases.

236
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,672
Yours or theirs?

237
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,837
Victor's.

238
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,833
Then I'd be worried if I was Victor.

239
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,312
I shouldn't have gone on vacation.

240
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,030
- What are you doing up?
- Couldn't sleep.

241
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,352
I didn't want to wake Sally,
although you have the creakiest floor.

242
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,036
It's an old house.
At least turn on a light.

243
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,918
Are you hungry?

244
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,310
Are you gonna have something?

245
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,230
Yes, but I really have to be careful
this time of year.

246
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,158
- Why?
- I'm trying to reduce.

247
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,950
Why don't you just be the way you are?
You're beautiful.

248
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,192
That's charming, and you know it.

249
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,353
My mother wore a girdle all the time,
and she always had a stomachache.

250
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,872
And I always thought, "You'd rather have
a stomachache just so Dad will like you?"

251
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,394
Sandy.

252
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,391
My mother passed away a few years ago,
and I understand.

253
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,831
This time of year is the hardest.

254
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,354
Oh, dear.

255
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,552
We're happy to include you in our family.

256
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,434
I can't go to Juilliard.

257
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,194
I know how you're feeling.

258
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:23,309
I was older than you, but I remember,
when I went to Bryn Mawr, I was terrified.

259
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,234
- But then the minute I-
- No. I didn't get in.

260
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,274
They rejected me.

261
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,760
Oh.

262
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,913
Of course you'd lie about that.

263
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,310
So you'll try again next year.

264
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,392
Tell everyone
you wanted to finish high school.

265
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,954
It's incredible how fast
some people come up with lies.

266
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,793
Please don't do that.

267
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,160
I'm old for a violinist,
at least for one as good as I am.

268
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,913
I don't care.
All I wanted to do was go to New York.

269
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,275
In a few years.

270
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,431
But it'll be too late.

271
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,432
My feet are already in wet cement.

272
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,876
Plenty of girls do just fine
without Juilliard.

273
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,838
Sure.

274
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,152
You go to college, you meet a boy...

275
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,994
you drop out, you get married...

276
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,073
struggle for a year in New York
while he learns to tie a tie...

277
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,671
and then move to the country and just
start the whole disaster over.

278
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,395
That's an arrogant exaggeration.

279
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,709
You have so much.

280
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,757
I didn't ask for it, and I don't need it.

281
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,991
You don't need it?

282
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,436
- Do you know what it's like to have nothing?
- Do you?

283
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,877
Why do you keep insulting me?
I'm trying to help.

284
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,395
No. Aren't you curious?

285
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,880
There are people in the Village.

286
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,952
I read about it, and I even visited them.

287
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,680
You went to the city alone?
Did Sally go with you?

288
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,114
No.

289
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,199
But she told me you went,
that you were a model.

290
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,396
Yes.

291
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,679
And I lived with five girls in two rooms
and ate soup out of cans.

292
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,229
It's not glamorous.

293
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,198
But I bet it was great.

294
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,829
It was different back then.

295
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,197
There weren't all the riots and robberies.
Do you watch the news?

296
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,750
I visited this building
right off St. Mark's Place.

297
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,514
And the kids are just living,
and it's beautiful.

298
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,954
You know?

299
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,999
People are naturally democratic
if you give them a chance.

300
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,755
- Are you on dope?
- No.

301
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,674
- But-
- But...

302
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,639
you're going to wait until you're old enough
to live on your own.

303
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,918
- It's two years.
- Hardly a jail sentence.

304
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,316
You know, you're not my child,
so there's no reason for me to say this.

305
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,314
But I go to the symphony quite a bit,
whether I like it or not...

306
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,076
and I am certain that you are talented.

307
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,676
And on the bright side,
Sally was crushed you were going away.

308
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,233
Want to use the bathroom?

309
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,789
- I think I'm feeling better.
- I'm not.

310
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,070
- There's Pepto-Bismol.
- I think it's too late.

311
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,474
I don't like vegetarian food.
Reminds me of Lent.

312
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,597
Yeah. It's a punishment.

313
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,598
- Hello?
- Peggy Olson, please.

314
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,239
This is Peggy. Who is this?

315
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,630
- Did you watch Carson?
- Who is this?

316
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,111
It's Burt. Burt Peterson.

317
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,192
Oh. Is everything okay?

318
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,432
I'm calling you at midnight.
We're screwed, Peggy.

319
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,520
We're at DEFCON 3.
We're about to go to DEFCON 4.

320
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,879
DEFCON 4 is better than DEFCON 3.
I've told you that. One is the worst.

321
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,395
- Then we're at zero.
- There is no zero.

322
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,315
Some comic on Carson was breaking
everybody up with this routine about the war.

323
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,394
Burt, it's very late and you sound
a little under the weather...

324
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,597
and there's such a thing
as free speech in this country.

325
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,151
I could give a hoot. Koss Headphones
wants to pull our Super Bowl spot.

326
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,273
<i>Okay? He hates the line now.</i>

327
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,000
"Lend me your ears"? It's Shakespeare.

328
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,635
Well, it's somehow related to something.

329
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,030
<i>The president. I don't know.
I didn't see it.</i>

330
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,593
<i>- You there?</i>
- Yes.

331
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,832
<i>- So you got to change your ad.</i>
- Now it's <i>my</i> ad?

332
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,594
<i>- He wants to meet for a discussion.</i>
- About what?

333
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,230
I don't know. Something bad.
I take the client's word for it.

334
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,993
- You've got to call Ted.
- About what?

335
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,719
I don't even know what the problem is.

336
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,520
It's better coming from you.
I've got to go.

337
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,956
What time is it in Colorado?

338
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,635
I don't know.
I can't do any math right now.

339
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,031
- I can't do any math at all.
- Please, honey, don't talk.

340
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,800
Morning.

341
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,111
I guess I don't say
"Merry Christmas" to you.

342
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,113
Save that for Sylvia. How was Hawaii?

343
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,237
Long ago and far away.

344
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,152
What's that camera you guys are selling?

345
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,550
- Pentax?
- Leica.

346
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,791
And which model will change my life?

347
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,877
Like everybody else,
I only know them by the price.

348
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,995
You know what? Come by.

349
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,276
I got a closetful.

350
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,795
- I'll give you one.
- Come on. I'll pay for it.

351
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,918
- I'd give one to Christiaan Barnard.
- I might just come by.

352
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,835
- You owe me just for that comment alone.
- You can come by right now.

353
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,594
No. I'm gonna be in surgery till 2:00.
Maybe after.

354
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,230
Remember, you come by my office,
I get to go to yours.

355
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,033
Another glorious morning, Dr. Rosen.

356
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,554
No good deed-

357
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,678
I don't know.

358
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,673
Probably part of a deeper question.

359
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,480
Because, I mean, none of them
are really blonde anyway, right?

360
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,717
She's 29 years old.

361
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,952
Hair darkens by that age,
so she's probably a brunette.

362
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,513
Maybe she does remind me of Jane.

363
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,752
No, I think it's more
than just distraction.

364
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,230
I think you're being hard on me.

365
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,720
<i>You</i> used the word "distraction."

366
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,998
Did I? Well, I need a vacation.

367
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,919
I'm busy. I'm a busy man.

368
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,032
I walk around that place,
people say "Good morning" to me.

369
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,680
They don't really care.
They don't know anything about me.

370
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,037
Oh, God, Doc, what is it all about?

371
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,952
Help me.

372
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,757
I say- I say that's a joke, son.

373
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,309
- We discussed this.
- What?

374
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,198
I can't laugh at everything you say.

375
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,717
Either it's funny or it's not.
I don't know how you can control yourself.

376
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,157
It's hard sometimes.
We talked about that too.

377
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,516
What exactly are you joking about?

378
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,672
You're obviously not afraid
that you're boring.

379
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,831
What are the events in life?

380
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,877
It's like you see a door.

381
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,872
The first time you come to it you say...

382
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,600
"Oh, what's on the other
side of the door?"

383
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,434
Then you open a few doors.
Then you say...

384
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,716
"I think I want to go over that bridge
this time. I'm tired of doors."

385
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,917
Finally you go through
one of these things...

386
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,435
and you come out the other side
and you realize that's all there are-

387
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,558
doors and windows and bridges and gates.

388
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,431
And they all open the same way,
and they all close behind you.

389
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,116
Look, life is supposed to be
a path and you go along...

390
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,715
and these things happen to you,
and they're supposed to change you.

391
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,476
Change your direction.
But it turns out that's not true.

392
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,359
It turns out the experiences are nothing.

393
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,036
They're just some pennies you pick up
off the floor, stick in your pocket...

394
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,909
and you're just going
in a straight line to you-know-where.

395
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,434
You sound afraid.

396
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,954
More like irritated.

397
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,037
And what do you think is causing that?

398
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,239
Top of the list- New Year's.
It's like an extra birthday.

399
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,596
You're supposed to blow out the candle
and wish for something.

400
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,831
I don't even know what it is.

401
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,158
How was your Christmas?

402
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,630
Same as the last five- ruined by work.

403
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,360
- How was yours?
- I'm a widower, Peggy.

404
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,875
Oh. I'm sorry.

405
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,400
Apparently there was a bunch of jokes
on the <i>Tonight Show</i> in question...

406
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,554
about soldiers cutting off ears in Vietnam.

407
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,031
And obviously we are gonna have
to go in another direction.

408
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,440
What did they say?

409
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,877
Well, I wasn't able to obtain
a copy or a transcript...

410
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,390
but Lawrence here is a devout viewer.

411
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,597
I don't know if I can do it justice.

412
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,751
Just shut up and do it.

413
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,714
Well, he came out and started talking...

414
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,680
about how that surgeon in South Africa
transplanted a heart.

415
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,800
And he says, "Now I know what I'm getting
President Johnson for Christmas."

416
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,478
- Who is this guy?
- I'm Lawrence.

417
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,155
- No, the comedian.
- We're finding that out.

418
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,312
- You have no information.
- We know the host was Phyllis Diller.

419
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,717
Get to the ears.

420
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,678
I don't remember how he got to it...

421
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,198
but it was something about how the first
transplants they did were with dogs.

422
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,671
So obviously there could be some sort
of mix-up or something.

423
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,231
Dad's better, but he goes nuts every time
we run the can opener.

424
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,000
He hates the mailman or something.

425
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,518
And, oh, he keeps ruining the carpet.

426
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,479
Only thing that stops him is hitting him
on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper.

427
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,512
Do you remember the ear joke or not?

428
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,991
Well, he went back to Christmas.

429
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,040
Did you hear about how there are these
GIs with interesting decorations?

430
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,032
'Cause they cut off the Vietcong's ears...

431
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,635
and wore them on a string around
their neck like a trophy.

432
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,590
- They really did that?
- There's a court-martial.

433
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,831
Did he actually say "Vietcong" on Carson?

434
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,594
I don't remember.
This is the best I can do.

435
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,149
- I think you're very good.
- You think so?

436
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,800
So, was that it?

437
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,230
No. The big laugh was-

438
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,596
A general comes up
to one of these guys and says...

439
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,592
"That's not regulation, son."

440
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,872
The soldier says, "Pardon?
Could you speak into my necklace?"

441
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,552
Biggest laugh even though
the transplant jokes were better.

442
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,280
That's not even funny.
What did Phyllis do?

443
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,519
She just said something like,
"I told you he was a sick puppy."

444
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,078
- When is Koss coming in?
- 1:00. Should I order lunch?

445
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,113
- He loves the Russian Tea Room.
- No, this is an emergency meeting.

446
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,953
I should probably practice a little more.

447
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,673
The client's already seen it.

448
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,356
Go home. There's no second show.

449
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,440
- What did Ted say?
- I left a message.

450
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,355
I don't think there's anything to do but work
our way through a hundred versions of no.

451
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,796
Listen, don't get in your own way.

452
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,793
No, I've seen creatives do this.
I've seen Ted do it.

453
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,360
This is the Super Bowl.

454
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,114
It's a lot of money.
A lot of exposure for the agency.

455
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,032
- There's probably awards down the road.
- I know.

456
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,032
Believe me, I know.

457
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,713
The fucking <i>Tonight Show.</i>

458
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,350
Now, Peggy, I think it's the army
that's really at fault here.

459
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,237
You look tan. Did you have fun?

460
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,869
- I'm sorry, but your name escapes me.
- I'm Bob Benson.

461
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,997
I'm upstairs in Accounts.

462
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,276
Beloit College, Wharton MBA.

463
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,511
Secor, Mohawk, Life Cereal.

464
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,069
You know, but just in the outfield.

465
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,073
- Yes, of course.
- We spoke at the Christmas party.

466
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,198
You seemed to know your way
around Pennsylvania.

467
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,876
You want one of these?
I get it right next door.

468
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,759
People will take a few extra steps
for a superior product.

469
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,151
- Doesn't it belong to someone else?
- No, I always get two. I don't want to share.

470
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,513
You know, I have through,
let's just say low-level corruption...

471
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,195
obtained tickets to the Cotton Bowl.

472
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,636
Crimson Tide versus Texas A&M.

473
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,912
You play football?

474
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,037
- What's in that coffee?
- Excuse me?

475
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,436
Oh.

476
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,475
Look, I've been trying
to get to know your team.

477
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,110
Not that I'm so important.
And they talk about you all the time.

478
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,233
So I guess I figured a few minutes
alone with you shouldn't be wasted.

479
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,118
Just a minute, Bob.

480
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,197
I smell creativity.

481
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,439
I love it down here.

482
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,719
I can't believe you just came off
of 10 hours of plane travel.

483
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,275
- You look great.
- No, Stan, you look great.

484
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,273
Changing the subject ever so slightly...

485
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,716
during your travels,
did you notice if the stewardesses...

486
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,680
would let a mother
hold a baby on her lap the whole ride?

487
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,558
- I believe so.
- Really?

488
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,638
Don't feel bad. How would you know?
You never had any kids.

489
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,757
Last time you left town,
it was in a covered wagon.

490
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,160
Because you're old.

491
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,789
You're so tan.

492
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,715
- So how was the vacation?
- He was on assignment.

493
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,793
On Waikiki Beach.
How much work do you think you got done?

494
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,794
Look at him.
He has the sea breeze in his hair.

495
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,031
You bring me something? Huh?

496
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,680
Dictaphone, cocktail napkins?

497
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,480
Anything that can give me a jump
on the Royal Hawaiian?

498
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,393
I had an experience.

499
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,999
I don't know how to put it into words.

500
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,393
Isn't Sheraton coming in on Friday?

501
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,591
He's still thinking. He just got back.

502
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,354
I'll tell you the experience.

503
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,438
Megan in a bikini.

504
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,796
Oh, Mr. Draper. There you are.

505
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,553
Good morning. How was your trip?

506
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,950
It was good, thank you.
What's going on here?

507
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,278
They're taking portraits for publicity.

508
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,432
You certainly look snappy.
I see you have coffee.

509
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,319
I scheduled you later in case you missed
the connection in Los Angeles.

510
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,074
Everything went smoothly.

511
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,269
Welcome back.

512
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,313
- I'm jealous just looking at you.
- I think you'd like it.

513
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,074
I don't know if it's the photographers
or the writers...

514
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,992
but it really smells like reefer in here.

515
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,433
- That has to be enough.
- I think we got it.

516
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,511
So, they treat you like King Kamehameha?

517
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,597
Miss, you mind?

518
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,837
- Are these in color?
- No, and I'm starting to regret it.

519
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,758
Do you mind holding onto
the rail, gorgeous?

520
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,712
Think of important things.

521
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,513
Caroline,
is the shoeshine here yet?

522
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,114
No one's going to see your shoes.

523
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,953
- I want you to call him.
- I did.

524
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,997
So, Don Ho.

525
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,720
Did you have a blue drink
in the white sand?

526
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,190
Ernest Borgnine chase you
down an alleyway with a switchblade?

527
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,873
I love that movie.

528
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,077
It was nice.

529
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,800
I think I'm next,
but I don't want to follow that act.

530
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,359
So, you have anything ready
for Sheraton on Friday?

531
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,716
Have I ever walked into this office
after an absence...

532
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,632
and not had you bring up
business immediately?

533
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,680
That's only because I've spent every
holiday waiting on work from you.

534
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,911
And then you walk away from me.

535
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,152
And then you take a nap.

536
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,358
- Oh, taking pictures.
- Yeah, we'll be done in a second.

537
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,877
Keep it down out here.

538
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,436
Oh, about your office.
They think it's better for the pictures.

539
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,319
- I don't agree.
- They'll move it back.

540
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,955
So when I left, where was I?

541
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,633
I'll get you the files.

542
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,833
As horrible as this is...

543
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,437
I don't think anyone has made this
connection outside of this comedian.

544
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,240
So it's likely that
any possible controversy-

545
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,834
Well, no one's seen the TV spot.

546
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,914
They've seen the print for three weeks,
side by side with the news story probably.

547
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,992
We haven't heard a peep.

548
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,072
So the controversy
is still in your imagination.

549
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,597
I won't deny that,
but this is a horrible thing.

550
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,273
I believe that's the word I used.

551
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,955
So?

552
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,839
- I thought I had a solution.
- We can't pull the ad.

553
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,957
Relax, Burt. And of course we can't.

554
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,192
No, I thought maybe we could just cut...

555
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,078
"Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your ears"...

556
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,757
and just start with saying
all the great stuff about the headphones.

557
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,192
That's a great idea.

558
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,591
- You think so?
- I think it's the first idea, but-

559
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,876
It solves everything.

560
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,357
Except it's just a man in a toga now.
It's a non sequitur.

561
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,276
Maybe people will think it's some kind of
sophisticated joke that they just didn't get.

562
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,196
I think that while it avoids any possibility
of controversy, it neuters the joke.

563
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,272
What the hell does that mean?

564
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,070
Look, you don't know what to do.
I'm telling you what do to.

565
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,198
You are.
You have solved the problem.

566
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,670
But it needs more than a solution.

567
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,752
It needs to be a great ad.

568
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,479
This is a great place to start.
I just need a little time.

569
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,631
Remember how long it took us
to come up with this one?

570
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,837
I don't know.
It just sort of came to you, didn't it?

571
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,879
No, you rejected a lot of things.

572
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,316
And we can't shoot
one of the things I rejected?

573
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,319
We just don't have the time.

574
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,397
Look, my job is to introduce
your headphones...

575
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,951
to a huge, drunk, male audience.

576
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,000
And it's not about my work.
It's about making a great ad.

577
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,711
The association not being with Vietnam
but with a laugh, a smile.

578
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,678
That all comes from your headphones.

579
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,954
- I don't know how to do that.
- But I do.

580
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,877
Give me a couple days.

581
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,956
Okay.

582
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,358
You've got to get a hold of Ted.

583
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,079
Why do they all have "love" in them?

584
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,117
- They asked for it.
- It's a big word.

585
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,192
I guess they heard it on the news.

586
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,792
- What the hell is this?
- They're newlyweds.

587
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,190
This couple doesn't exist.

588
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,071
Anything matrimonial feels Paleolithic.

589
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,232
What are you suggesting?
A little Haight-Ashbury colonial?

590
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,154
A couple of longhairs in love?
That'll get Dow going.

591
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,152
As much as I'd like to join all the ads...

592
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,232
making fun of the ubiquitous
San Francisco hippie...

593
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,994
let's try to trade on the word "love"
as something substantial.

594
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,471
I don't think
that's possible in this context.

595
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,712
So why are we contributing
to the trivialization of the word?

596
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,190
It doesn't belong in the kitchen.

597
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,000
"I love this." "I love my oven."

598
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,959
"You know what I'd love? I'd love a hamburger."
We're wearing it out.

599
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,999
Let's leave it where we want it.

600
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,835
We want that electric jolt to the body.

601
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,391
We want Eros.
It's like a drug. It's not domestic.

602
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,476
What's the difference between
a husband knocking on a door...

603
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,552
and a sailor getting off a ship?

604
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,871
About 10,000 volts.

605
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,229
Excuse me.

606
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,391
- Oh.
- Don't let me interrupt.

607
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,316
No, we were, uh,
just finishing up here. These are great.

608
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,159
Good to hear.

609
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,357
- This is a pleasant surprise.
- I got out early.

610
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,432
- Is that good or bad?
- What?

611
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,957
Oh, no. Everything's fine.
It was routine.

612
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,271
Well, uh, welcome to my hospital.

613
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,392
- You want a coffee or something?
- No. Thank you.

614
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,960
This is quite a spread.

615
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,032
Well, let's get you set up.

616
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,550
If I looked like you
and talked like that...

617
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,597
I wouldn't have had
to go to medical school.

618
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,876
Please, don't compare
what I do to what you do.

619
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,550
I'm not. Just part of me was hoping
that head was empty.

620
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,632
Can't resist cutting people open, can you?

621
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,360
All right, enough flirting.
Where's my camera?

622
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,954
I think this is the best one.

623
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,997
I don't know what to say.

624
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,120
Say you're gonna be the first American
to complete a successful heart transplant...

625
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,551
and that you'll appear in a magazine ad
attributing your success to your Leica.

626
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,155
Well, if that's the only way
you can give it to me.

627
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,074
- I was looking for you.
- Here I am.

628
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,752
Dr. Arnold Rosen.

629
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,435
Sorry, this is Miss Chambers,
my secretary.

630
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,194
I'm sorry, Dr. Rosen.
I didn't know you were coming by.

631
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,351
Oh, no, it's not business. He's a friend.

632
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,280
They're ready in your office.

633
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,352
- Who?
- They're setting up.

634
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,035
- The photographer.
- I'll do it.

635
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,997
No, you're gonna need a couple weeks
with those instructions.

636
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,390
This'll only take a minute.
Have you had lunch?

637
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,278
No, I have a full afternoon.

638
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,790
But I think our wives
are cooking something up for New Year's.

639
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,031
Told Sylvia to keep it in the building.

640
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,918
Wasn't my idea.

641
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,071
No, it'll be fun.

642
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,760
As long as I don't have to put on shoes,
it sounds perfect.

643
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,833
And again, thanks for the toy.

644
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,480
See, but I'm free tonight.

645
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,392
So call in sick.

646
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,916
It's easier for them
to replace you than me.

647
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,838
Don't get out of bed yet.

648
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,400
Yes?

649
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,156
I hate to disturb you,
but it's very urgent.

650
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,799
Okay, okay, sit down.

651
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,552
I have to hang up.
Looks like something bad happened.

652
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,520
Well, let me know
if your situation changes. Bye.

653
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,716
Okay. Bye.

654
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,110
Bye. Bye.

655
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,999
What the hell is going on?

656
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,396
I got some tragic news.
You should sit down.

657
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,278
I'll be fine.

658
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,799
Here.

659
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,039
- Your Aunt Jessica called.
- That's what I hung up for?

660
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,840
Your mother passed away this morning.

661
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,431
Caroline, honey,
she was 91 years old.

662
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,839
It's hardly a shock.

663
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,311
She was such a sweet woman,
and I know how close you were.

664
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,317
For 20 years, she's been saying
this is her last Christmas.

665
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,791
She was always so polite to me,
when she could hear me.

666
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,637
So I suppose I'm in charge
of the arrangements.

667
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,632
You want to call your aunt back?

668
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,952
Nah. She's a fruitcake.
She'll want to have a séance.

669
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,635
- Did she say what happened?
- She had a stroke.

670
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,117
In the bathroom.

671
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,479
Well, I asked, didn't I?

672
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,833
Talk to Joan. She'll know what to do.

673
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,829
Okay, okay.

674
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,310
Okay. You're gonna be okay.

675
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,240
Cheers.

676
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,555
Ah, yes. This is Peggy Olson,
and I'm calling for Mr. Chaough.

677
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,713
Yes, this is Peggy Olson.

678
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,716
Let's not exaggerate.
I've only called twice.

679
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:05,110
Look, Father- Oh, I'm sorry, Pastor.

680
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,873
I was raised Catholic.

681
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,551
Well, because my mother is.
My father is Lutheran.

682
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,678
Irish and Norwegian.

683
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,633
No, he passed away.

684
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,989
He was cremated.

685
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,676
Look, Pastor, I'm not saying that you didn't
give Mr. Chaough the message.

686
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,800
I'm just saying that
it bears some urgency.

687
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,998
Yes, which is to say I don't think
it would bother him at all...

688
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,799
to know that I'm on the phone.

689
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,076
Certainly. Do you have a pen?

690
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,792
This is Peggy Olson,
and I'm calling about the Super Bowl.

691
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,235
I'm in the office. He has the number.

692
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,789
How could you possibly
have written that down that fast?

693
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,272
I don't know. I think it's gonna be
Oakland or Houston against Green Bay.

694
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,430
And also with you. Good night.

695
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,279
Phyllis, can I get some coffee?
It's gone cold.

696
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,678
Is this really necessary?
I just got back from Hawaii.

697
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,117
You're backlit. So even with the tan,
you look like you haven't slept.

698
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,477
- Don't roll down the sleeves. Roll them up.
- Really?

699
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,473
You know what, Chico?
Forget the tripod. Give me the camera.

700
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,672
What do I do?

701
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,400
I want to see you lost
in that confident thought.

702
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,870
I want to see the brains
behind this operation.

703
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,917
Well, for one thing,
I'd be behind the desk...

704
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,593
and my desk would be over there.

705
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,320
Just do what you do.

706
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,316
Give me a minute.

707
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,394
That's good.

708
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,629
What's wrong?

709
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,749
Give me a little <i>Front Page.</i>

710
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,038
You know, hands on the desk
looking for an answer out that window.

711
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,320
What?

712
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,036
- What do you want?
- I want you to be yourself.

713
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,271
Sorry to wake you
when you're finally sleeping...

714
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,317
but I waited as long as I could.

715
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,360
What time is it?

716
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,831
They called me,
and they want me to work today.

717
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,151
I told them about the funeral,
but they can't move it to tomorrow...

718
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,630
because they'll need me then too.

719
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,713
In fact, they need me
for the rest of the week.

720
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,151
That's good, isn't it?

721
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,995
I called Jeff Hunter,
but I think his service won't wake him.

722
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,958
Isn't an agent supposed to call you?

723
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,553
Good news will keep.

724
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,431
I feel awful about the funeral. Will you
please give Roger my condolences?

725
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,193
Of course.

726
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,516
You should get some sleep.

727
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,798
How can I? My wife's a big TV star.

728
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,351
Get some sleep.

729
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,159
Break a leg.

730
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,478
Why are you eating?
Sandy's coming over for lunch.

731
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,678
First of all, I don't know
why you're counting my meals.

732
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,797
And second of all,
Sandy's not coming over.

733
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,511
Oh. That's a shame.
Is she sick?

734
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,069
Sick of being here.

735
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,152
She went to Juilliard early.

736
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,834
She did? When?

737
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,116
Did you want her to say
a tearful good-bye to you?

738
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,272
Well, frankly, yes.

739
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,875
Consider yourself lucky.

740
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,553
She was so stuck-up.

741
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:46,954
She kept saying how she really was going
to "look back on this time fondly."

742
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,475
I can't believe she did that.

743
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,473
She acts like she's 25
because she uses tampons.

744
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,075
Sally, please.

745
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,317
Did she give you her address?

746
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,074
Can you drive Jackie and me to the movies?

747
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,759
This is a great vacation.

748
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,550
<i>By the way, that, uh-</i>

749
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,594
You know, she was like a sister to me.

750
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,478
A much older sister.

751
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,394
How she could have a boy your age,
I don't know.

752
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,597
You could be her grandson.

753
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,036
You need to get your eyes checked.

754
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,033
- These are stunning rooms.
- Thank you.

755
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,874
He is so handsome.

756
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,749
I swear you have not aged a day.

757
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,874
Oh, Jane, darling.

758
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,600
- Thank you for coming.
- I thought I should.

759
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,514
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I would like to speak first.

760
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,353
I think you just did.

761
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,917
No, the eulogies. The remarks.
I wish to go first.

762
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,673
Of course. Of course.

763
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,875
If you need to speak to me,
I understand.

764
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,637
Thank you for rescuing me.

765
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,713
- From your admirers?
- You look wonderful.

766
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,998
I don't know if you remember,
but I have her ring.

767
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,400
- I don't know if you want it back.
- What am I gonna do with it?

768
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,156
For Margaret or-
I don't know, to bury her in it.

769
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,994
We already burned her up.
They steal that stuff anyway.

770
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,560
Just keep it. She liked you.

771
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,990
You always paid your rent on time.

772
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,630
- Do you want the victuals in the parlor?
- What?

773
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,720
Hold on, I didn't order any of this.

774
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,520
It's supposed to be tea and petits fours.

775
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,796
Oh, hell, put it in the dining room.

776
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,231
- I'm really sorry for your loss.
- She was a great lady.

777
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,630
"Bob Benson, S.C.D.P."
Who the hell is that?

778
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,791
That's from us.

779
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,476
- Daddy, I think it's time.
- What's the rush?

780
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,354
Thank you for coming.

781
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,354
God, she is all kinds of trouble,
isn't she?

782
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,272
Everything turns you on, doesn't it?

783
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,477
Is your mother still alive?

784
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,599
- Did I miss anything?
- You're just in time.

785
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,878
- How many funerals have you been to today?
- Excuse me?

786
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,553
He wants to know
where you got the drink.

787
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,674
Give my regards to Megan.

788
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,229
Rumor has it they're gonna
move her to four days a week.

789
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,915
Legend has it.

790
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,277
So, is she alive?

791
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,512
Yes, she is.

792
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,354
Don, what about your mother?
Still with us?

793
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,037
I'm gonna watch from over there.

794
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,237
If I could get your attention.

795
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,789
I'd like to thank everyone for coming.

796
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,475
I apologize for the dry atmosphere...

797
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,910
but as I've been reminded
many times today...

798
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,673
Mother did not approve of libations.

799
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,639
Excuse me, but I have a few words to say.

800
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,120
I insist.

801
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,876
Of course.
Why don't you roll on over here?

802
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,799
Can everyone forget
what I've said so far...

803
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,430
so that Mrs. Hazel Tinsley,
who graciously flew up from Palm Beach...

804
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,000
can have the honor of going first?

805
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,434
Stay here.

806
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,955
I want to say something, if I may,
at this informal moment...

807
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,509
because I do not believe
in speaking graveside.

808
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,599
This is where she lived,
and this is where she died.

809
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:53,034
"This woman spent 90 years on the Earth...

810
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,840
of noble birth and of some advantage...

811
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,596
devoting herself to one man,
but loving another."

812
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,310
That man was Roger. That's you.

813
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,996
"When Roger Sterling Sr.'s
brief time was over...

814
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,397
it was this Roger who filled her days.

815
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,838
One could not talk to her without hearing
about his achievements...

816
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,634
his wit, his kindness.

817
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,200
We all said, 'Mimsy.

818
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,591
Mims, you should find another man.
Life is long.'

819
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,155
She said, 'I don't need anyone.

820
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:30,110
My heart is full
because my son is my sunshine.'"

821
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,910
Get him out of here.

822
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,315
Sorry. I'm sorry.

823
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,800
Where were you?

824
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,360
I'm sorry, but is that man all right?

825
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,636
- What's he doing here?
- What?

826
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,677
- You heard me.
- Can we get someone in here to clean up?

827
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,070
- Let Bruce Pike clean it up.
- Roger.

828
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,753
I just wanted to pay my respects.

829
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,797
I think it would have been more
respectful of you not to come.

830
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,072
- She didn't like you either.
- I don't think I ever met your mother.

831
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,470
She wouldn't if she had.
This is supposed to be just family.

832
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,519
- See how upset everybody is?
- Roger, stop. Stop it this minute.

833
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,796
- You shouldn't have brought him.
- Daddy, please.

834
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,837
This is my funeral!

835
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,311
You know what? Party's over.
Everybody out.

836
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,920
Thank you very much. Out!

837
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,395
Thank you.

838
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,951
Pardon me. I'm looking for someone.
Could you help me?

839
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,513
Everybody's gone.

840
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,632
Not everybody, obviously.

841
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,315
I think they were overwhelmed
by that touching tribute.

842
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,119
What do you want?

843
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,556
That man never tires
of embarrassing himself.

844
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,154
You're the one who brought him.

845
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,074
I'm talking about Don.

846
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,675
Oh. He was just saying
what everybody else was thinking.

847
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,199
You shouldn't have brought him.

848
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,873
You're right.

849
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,476
Now you have one on me.
Do you feel better?

850
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,756
My mother's dead.

851
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,752
I know, Roger.

852
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,997
Must be very hard for you.

853
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,197
I don't feel anything.

854
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,989
You certainly seem emotional.

855
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,560
Because I need a drink.

856
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,195
She lived a long time.

857
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,715
And she knew that you loved her.

858
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,599
So maybe there's nothing to drink about.

859
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,914
I feel like she always wanted to spend
time with me, and I never did.

860
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,435
That may be something to consider.

861
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,716
You have a family.

862
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,395
Are you kidding me?
I looked out at that crowd...

863
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,392
and all I saw was a bunch
more women I've disappointed.

864
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,157
Roger Sterling, no matter what you do,
everyone loves you.

865
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,950
What you're seeing is them worried
about how you feel about them.

866
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,038
So, you miss me?

867
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,952
I know your daughter does.

868
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,910
Don't you wonder
what Margaret will say at your funeral?

869
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,160
- You had to bring that up.
- I did.

870
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,959
You should spend more time with her.

871
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,793
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

872
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,714
Remember the last time
this bed was covered in furs?

873
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,110
We rolled around all over them.

874
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,157
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

875
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,038
You look great.

876
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,112
It would be soothing.

877
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,118
Soothe yourself.

878
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,072
I'm gonna clean up.

879
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,834
Jonesy.

880
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,479
Mr. Draper, are you all right?

881
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,791
- He's not feeling well.
- Hey, Jonesy.

882
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,190
Jonesy, what did you see?

883
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,317
I didn't see nothing, Mr. Draper.

884
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,392
No, no, when you died, what did you see?

885
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,877
- Don, let's get you upstairs.
- Wait, I want to know. I want to know.

886
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,073
What did you see when you died?

887
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,550
I don't know.
Doc said I wasn't really dead.

888
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,030
I saw it. You were dead.
He died right there.

889
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,477
- What did you see?
- I don't like to think about it.

890
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,473
- You must have seen something.
- I guess there was a light.

891
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,792
- Was it like hot, tropical sunshine?
- I don't know.

892
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,520
- Did you hear the ocean?
- Mr. Draper, you should go upstairs.

893
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,511
- Is he all right?
- He'll be fine.

894
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,397
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

895
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,358
- Is that St. Mark's Place?
- Yep.

896
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,558
I'm sorry, I'm looking for someone.
A girl.

897
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,997
- Which one?
- This one.

898
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,799
There's lots of chicks
that come in and out of here.

899
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,520
I've been in the buildings across the street.
Are you sure you haven't seen her?

900
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,877
Look, lady, it's cold as a witch's tit.
We're going inside.

901
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,839
- May I?
- Door's always open, man.

902
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,240
Hey, I got the pork butt,
and I lifted a bunch of onions.

903
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,599
Sandy?

904
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,314
Sandy?

905
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,232
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

906
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,555
I'm sorry to bother you again...

907
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,077
but this violin, this belongs to the girl
I was talking about.

908
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,674
Are you sure you haven't seen her?

909
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,036
Look, lady, I don't want to have to lay
the regular rap on you...

910
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,352
but I am exhausted from telling people
like you I haven't seen people like her.

911
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,399
- But she was here.
- I haven't seen your daughter.

912
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,312
She's not my daughter.

913
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,835
So, what are you,
some kind of social worker?

914
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,513
A violin teacher?

915
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,036
Shit. What's her name?

916
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,110
Sandy.

917
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,796
Hey, anybody seen Sandy?

918
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,109
Do you know how to make goulash?

919
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,277
'Cause I've got pork butt,
two onions, and lentils...

920
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,714
which I think is what's in it.

921
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,680
Hey, Moon, turn around.

922
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,829
And paprika. I know that's in it.

923
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,391
Well, for one thing, you'll need a pot.

924
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,073
We got a pot.

925
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,393
You'll have to wash it out.

926
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,073
There's no water.

927
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:21,996
Really?

928
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,992
We used to use the hose
at the Episcopal church...

929
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,197
but now the pipes are frozen.

930
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,670
It was great here all summer.
It was hot.

931
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,229
So much rather be hot than cold.

932
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,551
I'll go on the roof
and get a chunk of snow.

933
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,519
- Oh, you'll get sick.
- We do it all the time.

934
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,915
My mom makes great goulash.

935
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,469
- Where are you from?
- Everywhere.

936
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,440
Hold on. I think
there's an army knife by the bed.

937
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,480
Hello?

938
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,599
- Your mother still here?
- No. She left.

939
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,791
I'm just waiting for them
to wrap up the deli.

940
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,473
Where's Skeezix?

941
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,517
Brooks took him bike riding.

942
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,074
It's kind of cold out there.

943
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,879
He can't tell the difference.

944
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:15,716
The other day he walked in singing,
and I looked and his nose was bleeding.

945
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,759
- He didn't know how he did it.
- So he's tough.

946
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,717
Listen, I want you to have something.

947
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,553
This was your grandmother's.

948
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,352
My dad brought it back for her.

949
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,789
He went everywhere.

950
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,475
- What is it?
- It's water from the River Jordan.

951
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,559
I was baptized with it. So were you.

952
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,474
We would have used it on Ellery,
but I guess she forgot.

953
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,029
Hope she didn't put her teeth in it.

954
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,271
Well, thank you. It's lovely.

955
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,919
Did Nana Mimsy leave me anything else?

956
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,879
I'm afraid she left everything to the zoo.

957
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,350
She's making them name the animals.

958
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,557
I'm sorry.

959
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,438
That doesn't seem funny to me.

960
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,954
It does to me.

961
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,191
Her will looked like
the manifest from Noah's ark.

962
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,674
Well, it's different for you.

963
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,632
Brooks didn't start off where you did.

964
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,276
- He'll get there.
- Oh, I know he will.

965
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,919
It's just that there's-

966
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,311
Well, Daddy, there's this opportunity.

967
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,555
I don't know, I-

968
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:45,111
I told Nana about it,
but obviously she didn't understand.

969
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,037
Were you this specific?

970
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,350
Daddy, don't. It's not good for you.

971
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,671
I worry.

972
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,800
Refrigeration.

973
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,953
It's the wave of the future, Daddy.

974
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:06,636
They can transport fruit all the way
from California in just four days...

975
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,035
and it doesn't go bad.

976
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,680
Some of these trucks can carry 20 tons.

977
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,798
And, of course, you're buying the technology
for the refrigerated trucks...

978
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,599
so it doesn't
matter what they get used for.

979
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,353
It's really not Brooks's problem.

980
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:22,635
Well, I guess you should have Brooks
talk to me about it.

981
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,040
Of course.

982
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,510
I know he'd like to make it
on his own, but-

983
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,559
- I'd have to see something on paper.
- Oh, he's got that, believe me.

984
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,117
Well, good.

985
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:37,716
- And I'm glad we had this little chat.
- Oh, Daddy.

986
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:46,597
I'm going to go see
if they're done in the kitchen.

987
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,750
<i>Don?</i>

988
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,400
Don?

989
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:04,391
Did you make it to the memorial?

990
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,790
Except for the mess,
you're exactly where I left you.

991
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,839
I put in an appearance.
I should have had lunch.

992
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,400
Aspirin?

993
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,518
I'm better now. You?

994
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,559
Well, I pushed Derek's mother
down the stairs.

995
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,950
- Did you?
- I did.

996
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,874
They wanted me to radiate evil,
so I looked her in the eyes.

997
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,599
But I don't know
how close the camera was...

998
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,592
because it was a stuntman in a dress.

999
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,479
Don't worry. I don't think
there's a nice way you can do that.

1000
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,916
I'm not sure people
will want my autograph anymore.

1001
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,992
Yes, they will.

1002
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:38,596
So you'll still love me
even if I'm a lying, cheating whore?

1003
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,479
But I'm gonna walk
behind you on the stairs.

1004
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,589
Okay. Well, I'm gonna make you dinner.

1005
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,356
Oh, Rosa found this in the garbage.

1006
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,760
I think she was afraid
you'd think she was stealing.

1007
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,117
Sleep. I'll come get you.

1008
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,032
Hey, Danny, where'd you take that joint?

1009
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,589
There's three fucking rooms.
Where do you think I am?

1010
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,674
No, thank you.

1011
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,912
- Is marijuana expensive?
- Do I have to stir it again?

1012
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,435
- Is it boiling?
- No.

1013
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,513
- My coat smells like onions.
- Yoo-hoo.

1014
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,354
You better tell him you did
the cooking, man. It's your job.

1015
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,794
It's my bag.

1016
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,475
- It smells good.
- I made goulash.

1017
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,200
- Did you get Wonder Bread?
- We got batteries.

1018
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,840
Hey, Zal, did you make any friends today?

1019
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,395
Did you run into this chick-
What's her name?

1020
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,317
I'm sorry. This violin belongs
to my friend Sandy.

1021
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,436
Do you know when she'll be back?

1022
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,591
Sorry, Blondie,
but that violin belongs to me.

1023
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,157
No, I know the girl who plays this violin,
and I'm looking for her.

1024
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,955
Yeah, no, I saw her. She sold it to me.

1025
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:09,078
She's trying to get enough bread
to go to California. Says it's too cold.

1026
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,031
So where is she now?

1027
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,237
- Does she owe you money?
- No.

1028
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:18,233
Well, your daughter's long gone, Blondie,
so why don't you run along?

1029
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,074
- Come on, Zal.
- Why are you being so rude?

1030
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,198
Why can't you leave her be?
Kills you to be out of control.

1031
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,476
Well, someone needs to control this mess.

1032
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,677
Lady, we have to take everything
the Establishment throws away.

1033
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,356
That's all that's left. What you can't grok
is that we are your garbage.

1034
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,557
You don't want this house.
You don't want us.

1035
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,757
You're not allowed
to ask anybody to leave.

1036
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:40,277
The bylaws say if someone is a nuisance
or a narc, that shall not be observed.

1037
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,152
I'm obviously not the people
you're talking about.

1038
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:46,153
I came here because I'm looking
for someone that I do want.

1039
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:49,551
- I did not throw her away.
- Yeah, you're a goody. I can tell.

1040
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,153
Look at this. She's got 80 bucks.

1041
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,876
- Can I have it?
- No. That's all they care about.

1042
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:05,072
Well, Miss Elizabeth Hofstadt Francis
of Rye, New York...

1043
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:08,312
eyes blue, hair bottled...

1044
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,151
we don't like your life
any more than you do.

1045
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,591
You have bad manners.

1046
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,717
You deserve to live
in the street of this pigsty...

1047
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:21,237
and I hope you get tetanus or crabs or
whatever else is crawling around here.

1048
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,039
Hey, that's my violin.

1049
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,597
She sold it? I don't believe you.

1050
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,478
You want it?
I'll give it to you for 10.

1051
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,712
- What are you going to do with a violin?
- Gonna learn how to play it.

1052
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,598
Because it's so easy.

1053
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,754
There's a meatball,
which is probably cold by now.

1054
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,912
And an Italian.
It's probably even colder.

1055
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,830
You're typing a lot.
You got a new way to go?

1056
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,037
No, I'm doing this thing Don used to do.

1057
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,760
I'm writing a letter
to a fictitious acquaintance...

1058
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,071
telling her how great
my new headphones are.

1059
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,112
Well, I hate
that it gives you extra work...

1060
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,510
but I think it's about time...

1061
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,672
this unjust war is finally having
an impact on commerce.

1062
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,991
Meatball.

1063
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,314
- Did we order dinner?
- No.

1064
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,517
- Oh.
- I can share.

1065
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,752
Try the headphones again.
Try and think of some words.

1066
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,520
- What have you got?
- We have three very different angles.

1067
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,597
If you dip the audio in the wide shot...

1068
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:51,469
then Mark Antony is just, you know,
mouthing the "lend me your ears" part.

1069
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,631
You hear the announcer say
one of these things-

1070
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:57,191
One. "Are you ready for
the sound for the ages?"

1071
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:01,473
Two. "Koss knows that
good sound is timeless."

1072
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,677
Or "Ladies and gentlemen...

1073
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,992
this is not your old-fashioned sound."

1074
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,112
What's the next one?

1075
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,238
- The next one or the second one?
- You said you had three.

1076
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,391
Those were three.
Didn't I read all of them?

1077
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:17,279
Those are three different versions
of the same idea.

1078
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,511
If you can't tell the difference between
which part's the idea...

1079
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,195
and which part's the execution of the idea,
you're of no use to me.

1080
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,760
I know what you're doing. I've been you.

1081
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,513
You're hoping
this sparks my imagination...

1082
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,120
and then you can say,
"Wow, she's a genius"...

1083
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,431
or say anything because
you want to go home.

1084
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,517
I think they're very
different from each other.

1085
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,911
Well, I'm sorry to point it out,
but you're walking over the same ground.

1086
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,799
When you bring me something like this,
it looks like cowardice.

1087
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,600
Here, you can split this
'cause you're not going home.

1088
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,240
What do you think?

1089
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:48,800
What?

1090
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:55,158
- How do they sound?
- Scared. You were a little rough.

1091
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,436
No, the headphones.
Don't worry about them.

1092
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,830
Some workers don't respond to that.

1093
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,515
Look, Abe, I don't need
another negative voice.

1094
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,751
And those, quote, "workers" aren't
surprised that I'm frustrated...

1095
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,433
because they know that they're lazy.

1096
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,400
Sorry. I didn't know what kind of abuse
was required to get into the frat.

1097
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,074
Listen to your music, kid.

1098
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,719
Because you laughed at him.

1099
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,951
Yes, they like that.

1100
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,713
Hello.

1101
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,833
Where you been?

1102
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:06,270
I had some errands to run.

1103
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,549
Well, I know what somebody's
getting next Christmas.

1104
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,553
Did you eat?

1105
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,518
Chicken salad.

1106
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:22,150
That's a relief,
because my feet are frozen.

1107
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,312
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

1108
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,198
Morning. How are we today?

1109
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,840
- Fine, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1110
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:38,718
Seeing as how you
were under the weather...

1111
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,679
I just wanted to remind you
about Jules and Terry from Sheraton later.

1112
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,399
Cancel.

1113
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,073
Their bosses are coming back next week...

1114
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:47,550
and they just sent you
on a very expensive trip.

1115
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,193
Would you get Stan in here?

1116
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,397
Oh, listen.

1117
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,154
I got this by mistake.
It belongs to some private.

1118
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,516
See if you can find out some way
to get it to his division.

1119
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,717
I will. Do you want to enclose a note?

1120
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:05,430
Nah. I found it on a barstool.

1121
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,512
I mean, you've got to be
on my side here, right?

1122
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,480
First, my ex-wife works the body
with a brutal guilt attack...

1123
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,359
and then my daughter
works the wallet like a speed bag.

1124
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,079
You want me on your side?

1125
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:19,312
- You have kids?
- We're not talking about me.

1126
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,357
You know, I used to jump off mountains.

1127
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,871
It never occurred to me
I had this invisible parachute.

1128
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:29,273
My mother loved me in some
completely pointless way, and it's gone.

1129
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:34,116
So there it is.
She gave me my last new experience.

1130
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:39,753
And now I know that all I'm going to be doing
from here on is losing everything.

1131
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,274
You feel loss.

1132
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:45,671
Damn it, how many times do I have to say
this? I don't feel anything.

1133
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,673
I'm just acknowledging that life,
unlike this analysis...

1134
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,589
will eventually end
and somebody else will get the bill.

1135
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,960
- Good morning, Ken.
- Good morning, Bob.

1136
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,872
What are you doing out here?

1137
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,553
You have a meeting with someone important?

1138
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,711
No, but are you looking for me?

1139
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,918
I'll drop everything.
I just came out here to enjoy the light.

1140
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,198
I thought maybe you were out here
greeting customers for your catering business.

1141
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,160
- What are you talking about?
- You know exactly.

1142
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,315
I'm sorry, are you cross with me?

1143
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,030
Someone sent a royal spread to Sterling's.
It had a card on it with your name.

1144
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,999
Oh, that.
It just seemed the thing to do.

1145
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,673
Well, it was too much.

1146
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,719
It was almost like you were invited,
but you weren't.

1147
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:43,350
I guess I was just remembering
when my father died.

1148
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,790
Any gesture meant something to me.

1149
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,837
There wasn't supposed to be a card.

1150
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:54,030
Okay. Well, take your work
and go back to your office.

1151
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,351
Sitting out here makes people think
you have nothing to do...

1152
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,716
and I suspect you're
hoping it's the opposite.

1153
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,634
I guess it's time to catch up
on my phone calls.

1154
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,712
Look, we're sorry we had to squeeze in
this meeting between the holidays.

1155
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,315
We're obviously
not expecting a full presentation.

1156
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,232
Well, I can say with all honesty...

1157
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,472
that Don has not stopped
talking about your incredible property.

1158
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,758
I never stayed at the Royal, but I shipped
out of Pearl in 1943...

1159
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,674
and, I've got to say,
I can still smell the gardenias.

1160
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,719
Thank you for that. Don?

1161
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:39,477
So, Bob Grange and his delightful wife,
Patty, saw to our every need...

1162
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:43,395
and also missed no opportunity
to expose us to the unique local flavor.

1163
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,631
Lucky Bob. I tried to get that job...

1164
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:48,360
but unfortunately I got promoted.

1165
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,398
Well, I've just come back...

1166
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,040
and I'm not sure how much
I've talked about it...

1167
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:57,272
but there is a feeling
that's stayed with me.

1168
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,192
I've been in the winter.

1169
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,272
It's quite a shock coming back.

1170
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:04,512
Well put.
But that could be any vacation.

1171
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,069
This was very, very different.

1172
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,594
I think we're not selling
a geographical location.

1173
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,672
We're selling an experience.

1174
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:18,357
It's not just a different place.
<i>You</i> are different.

1175
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,909
And you'd think there'd be
an unsettling feeling...

1176
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,515
about something so drastically different,
but there's something else.

1177
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:29,955
You don't miss anything.
You're not homesick.

1178
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:33,033
It puts you in this state.

1179
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:37,273
The air and the water are all the same
temperature as your body.

1180
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,114
It's sensory- the music, the fragrance.

1181
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,795
The breeze and the blue. Stan.

1182
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,635
It's just a sketch.

1183
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:52,555
Hawaiian legend has it that the soul
can go in and out of the body...

1184
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:57,396
but that it usually leaves
from a leeward point into the waves.

1185
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,996
"Hawaii. The jumping off point."

1186
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,431
So what happened to him?

1187
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,796
He got off the plane,
took a deep breath...

1188
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,834
shed his skin and jumped off.

1189
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,037
I assume this is a photograph.

1190
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,680
Four-color. That water is transparent.

1191
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:23,719
Well, I suppose it reminds
me a little of the cinema.

1192
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:29,394
But mostly I see James Mason
at the end of that movie walking into the sea.

1193
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,000
What is that movie?

1194
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,753
I'm not sure I know
what you're talking about.

1195
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,514
He's killing himself.
I don't think they show it...

1196
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,160
but he's going to swim out
until he can't swim back.

1197
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:45,478
That may be a personal association for you,
but that's not what this means.

1198
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:48,314
We looked at this.
None of us thought of that.

1199
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,790
<i>A Star is Born.</i>

1200
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,271
The copy is all about the Hawaiian legend.

1201
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,955
Aloha means hello and good-bye.

1202
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,509
I'm sorry, but this is very poetic.

1203
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,956
- Thank you.
- Where's our hotel?

1204
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:05,556
Where's the Pink Palace and Diamond Head?

1205
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,399
You got to have Diamond Head in the shot.

1206
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:09,039
Anyone can do that.

1207
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,200
I don't agree.

1208
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,038
Well, there's no reason
we can't tilt the camera up 45 degrees...

1209
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,954
and see the husk of our
city dweller on the sand...

1210
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:25,556
and an arm of the hotel
and Diamond Head in the background.

1211
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:29,429
So there would be a man in this photo,
and he'd most likely be naked?

1212
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,354
Actually, my first thought
is there is no man.

1213
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:35,592
Just his footprints. What happened to him?

1214
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:41,039
I think, and I think people might think,
that he died.

1215
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,873
Maybe he did and he went to heaven.

1216
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,680
Maybe that's what this feels like.

1217
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,832
- It's a little morbid.
- Well, heaven's a little morbid.

1218
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,355
How do you get to heaven?
Something terrible has to happen.

1219
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,956
We don't want that in the ad.

1220
01:17:55,040 --> 01:18:00,069
Of course there's no doubt this concept itself
is merely a jumping-off point.

1221
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:05,835
A picture of a hotel, even yours,
is easy to ignore.

1222
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,277
This, or some version of this,
demands your attention.

1223
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,751
Well, you will continue
to have our attention.

1224
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,275
Make no mistake,
we're not afraid of provocative.

1225
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,714
So is there any time left
for holiday plans for either of you?

1226
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,957
- Happy New Year, everyone.
- You as well.

1227
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,270
What's the matter? You didn't get all your
vomiting done at my mother's funeral?

1228
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,158
Roger, I apologize. I had a bug.

1229
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,277
Yeah, well, you didn't miss anything.

1230
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,919
Does that make you think of suicide?

1231
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,277
Of course.
That's what's so great about it.

1232
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:46,872
You know, we sold actual death
for 25 years with Lucky Strike.

1233
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,317
You know how we did it? We ignored it.

1234
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,117
Hold on.

1235
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,919
Can I go to Becky's for New Year's Eve?

1236
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,640
- Talk to your mother.
- Can't you get a sitter?

1237
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:13,758
Have your friend come here.
You can bang pots and pans at midnight.

1238
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,150
It's a party.
They can't bring the whole party here.

1239
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,960
I'll stay until 9:00.
I'll put them to bed.

1240
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,998
- Hello.
- Ask your mother. We're in here.

1241
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:32,516
So? Anything new?

1242
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:35,513
I hate it. You're ugly.

1243
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,920
What happened to you?

1244
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,074
So?

1245
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,390
Elizabeth Taylor...

1246
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,711
what have you done with my wife?

1247
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,510
You're free until lunch,
but I have to tell you something.

1248
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,114
Just a minute. What's that?

1249
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:03,238
More bad news. Giorgio died.

1250
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,874
His family sent over his shoeshine kit...

1251
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,838
because you were the only one
who called about him.

1252
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:10,277
- What happened to him?
- I didn't ask.

1253
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:00,631
So the secret is to rub the pot
with a clove of garlic...

1254
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,359
and then add twice the kirschwasser.

1255
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:06,036
How wonderful that we can
just stagger downstairs.

1256
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,397
I might just get undressed
in the elevator.

1257
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,949
I don't know if I can
make it to midnight...

1258
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,680
but I do know we're not leaving here
until those kids are in bed.

1259
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,320
It's a beautiful fondue pot.
Where'd you get it?

1260
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,677
Bloomingdale's- the kitchen store.
They have everything you could think of.

1261
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,958
Not everything. Tell the story.

1262
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,879
Well, there's a guy in my office.

1263
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,636
He's very flamboyant,
and he got arrested there.

1264
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:35,235
- Shoplifting?
- No.

1265
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,357
But he was caught red-handed.

1266
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:42,791
Apparently the men's room is a locale
for a certain kind of assignation...

1267
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,952
and the store detective's always going
in there and looking under the stall.

1268
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:49,078
So, my regional sales manager...

1269
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:53,120
apparently takes two shopping bags,
puts his feet in them...

1270
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,840
while the love of his life
sat on the john.

1271
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,037
That is clever.

1272
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,874
How the hell did he get caught?

1273
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,713
How old are your children?

1274
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,840
Um, 1 1 and seven.

1275
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,480
Well, I might go kiss them good night.

1276
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,517
Ours is a freshman at Michigan.

1277
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,991
- He didn't even come home.
- Oh, I'm not ready for that.

1278
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:19,710
The house feels empty.
Then you get a phone bill.

1279
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:26,117
Well, if everybody's had enough cheese,
I'm gonna switch to chocolate.

1280
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:31,036
But first, because it looks
like it's snowing...

1281
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:34,750
I think it's time
we all took a trip to Hawaii.

1282
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,230
We're having such a good time.

1283
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,800
It's all set up.

1284
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,997
I want to go to Hawaii.

1285
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,397
- Isn't it incredible?
- Yeah.

1286
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,676
Oh, let me explain.

1287
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:25,710
I woke up in the morning, and Don
was at a wedding giving away the bride.

1288
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,553
That's romantic.

1289
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:29,233
How did that happen?

1290
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,270
So, of course, Kreutzer's yelling...

1291
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:40,434
and Ginsberg says, "I'm sorry, but what
the hell do I know about ham?"

1292
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:45,034
How could they let him near clients?
Haven't they learned?

1293
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,875
Hey, do you think Joan and Roger
are still sleeping together?

1294
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,914
Because his mother croaked,
and she completely ignored him.

1295
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,640
I don't know. We don't even know
if that really ever happened.

1296
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:58,280
I've got pictures in my head.

1297
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,716
I'm gonna go grab some coffee.

1298
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,314
- You want some?
- Very funny.

1299
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,993
Hey, I'm not hanging up.

1300
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,877
Happy New Year.

1301
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,192
Ted. What are you doing here?

1302
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:15,079
I heard there were four people
in the office on New Year's Eve.

1303
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,311
I figured I owed it to the team
to at least stop by.

1304
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,551
Oh, I'm just-

1305
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:22,872
There's a- Did you get my message?

1306
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,872
I received them all.

1307
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,351
And I apologize, but it was sort of
a retreat for my wife and I.

1308
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:31,274
And, well, apparently I work too much.

1309
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,192
Well, you know the problem.

1310
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,351
Yes. Any solutions?

1311
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,113
There's one.

1312
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,157
I found this thing.

1313
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,876
- What is this?
- It's an outtake.

1314
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:47,636
He had his headset on
and was clowning around.

1315
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:50,560
There's two minutes of it.

1316
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:57,470
Look at this guy. What a pain in the ass.

1317
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:01,236
I was irritated about it on the day,
but now I'm a little excited.

1318
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:07,912
I think you can show him making these faces-
no music- and say something like...

1319
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:13,195
"Koss Headphones- sound so sharp
and clear, you can actually see it."

1320
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,432
It always takes a crisis
to sell work this good.

1321
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,120
You think it's good?

1322
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,351
Makes me smile more than the original.

1323
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,872
- Do you want to see the new voice-over?
- No.

1324
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,959
Well, I hope I didn't ruin your evening.

1325
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:35,636
Not mine, but there's people working
out there, Peggy. It's New Year's Eve.

1326
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:38,030
If you knew you had something,
you should have let them go.

1327
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:41,238
- They know they can go.
- No, they don't.

1328
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,276
Oh.

1329
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,117
You're good in a crisis.

1330
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:52,199
Thank you.

1331
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,556
Happy New Year.

1332
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,072
<i>He likes you.</i>

1333
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,349
- What did you hear?
- All of it.

1334
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:14,874
This is Galliano. From Jonesy.

1335
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,431
I'm glad he's giving presents
to someone else.

1336
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,352
I can't stand the constant bootlicking.

1337
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:21,920
He's grateful.

1338
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:26,031
<i>- Cent'anni.</i>
- What does that mean?

1339
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,191
It's Italian for l'chaim.

1340
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,431
It means "a hundred years."

1341
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:37,632
What do you think
Dave paid for their place?

1342
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:39,632
Arnold, don't.

1343
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,110
Fine. Don, what did you pay?

1344
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,476
Seventy-five.

1345
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,916
Well, you're a floor higher than us.

1346
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,311
Jesus. Syl, did you hear that?

1347
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,959
Happy New Year.

1348
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:58,559
We missed midnight. It's 1:00.

1349
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:01,200
We missed it.

1350
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:03,994
- It's probably my mother.
- Or Dave and Cathy.

1351
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,515
Face down in the hall.

1352
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:07,920
Hello?

1353
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:13,797
- Um, Arnie, it's the service.
- Thank you.

1354
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,516
Hello?

1355
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,313
Okay.

1356
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:26,316
All right, tell them I'm on my way.

1357
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,160
I've got to go.

1358
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,597
I need cigarettes. I'll walk you down.

1359
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:41,232
It's 1:00 a.m. in a snowstorm
on a holiday on a Sunday.

1360
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,874
You are never gonna get a cab.

1361
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,680
Don't even try to talk him out of it.

1362
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:02,239
- These them?
- Yeah, you see the boots?

1363
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:14,076
What is it like to have
someone's life in your hands?

1364
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:21,429
Well, it's a privilege and an honor
to be trusted with that responsibility.

1365
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:25,914
There they are.

1366
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,960
Look at that.

1367
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,595
Time to quit smoking.

1368
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:40,990
It's a good resolution.

1369
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:45,393
Well, one lucky patient.

1370
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:50,916
Honestly, Don, the whole life-and-death thing-
it doesn't bother me. Never has.

1371
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,679
Guys like us, that's why we get paid.

1372
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,070
- Us?
- Fine.

1373
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:58,311
You get paid to think about things
they don't want to think about...

1374
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,198
and I get paid to not think about them.

1375
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,479
People will do anything
to alleviate their anxiety.

1376
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,672
Did you read my Dante?

1377
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,791
It made me think of you.

1378
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,991
I don't know how to take that.

1379
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,831
It's beautiful.

1380
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:49,673
What do you want for this year?

1381
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,511
I want to stop doing this.

1382
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,433
I know.

1383
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,353
Happy New Year.

1384
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,360
Happy New Year.
