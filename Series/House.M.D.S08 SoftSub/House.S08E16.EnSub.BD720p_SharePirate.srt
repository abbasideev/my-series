1
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:03,839
Come on!

2
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:22,358
Yeah!

3
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,823
Hatchet! Hatchet!

4
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,591
Hatchet! Hatchet!

5
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:57,668
<i>Come on, Toros!
Let's make some noise!</i>

6
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:59,666
Nice to meet the pride
of Trois-Rivières.

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,830
I still got your
Wings rookie card.

8
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,000
So what's that worth? Well,
it's a collector's item.

9
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,441
They don't make them
like you anymore.

10
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,570
So you want to go?

11
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:08,840
Square up. Good luck.

12
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,600
He didn't get a hand on you?

13
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,271
You're gonna be
a force in the show.

14
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,103
Hatchet! Hatchet! Hatchet!

15
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,972
Hatchet! Hatchet! Hatchet!

16
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,640
Come on, Toros!

17
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,057
Get a trainer over here!

18
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:44,339
Capacity crowd is on its
feet, five seconds on the clock.

19
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,876
Ah!

20
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:51,614
How is it possible for one man to
be blessed with so much skill?

21
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,617
I had one just like this, except
it was Bruins and the Habs.

22
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:58,679
Where'd you get it?

23
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:02,352
Birthday present for someone
in pediatric oncology.

24
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,794
Twenty-two-year-old
enforcer with hemoptysis.

25
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,853
He's a hockey player?

26
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,023
No, he's a superhero.

27
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,795
He's coughing up blood because
he probably broke a rib

28
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,303
and punctured a lung while
breaking someone else's rib

29
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,306
and puncturing their lung
in the name of sport.

30
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:20,538
Nice conclusion, to which the
ER already jumped 18 hours ago.

31
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,545
Short man equals bullied child.

32
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:25,139
I was average height as a kid.
And never bullied.

33
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,309
Until now.

34
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:31,722
X-ray ruled out traumatic sequelae,
overt TB and lung cancer.

35
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:35,487
Sarcoidosis. Nodules could be too
small to show up on an X-ray.

36
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,152
But fighting's
the best part of hockey.

37
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,719
Without it, you've
got the Ice Capades.

38
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,662
Fighting has nothing
to do with hockey.

39
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,496
It's like the cheerleaders
at a basketball game.

40
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,262
Cheerleading's
the best part of basketball.

41
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,837
Without it,
you've got basketball.

42
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,499
He's a duck hunter.

43
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,405
He could have contracted
psittacosis from exposure to fowl.

44
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,910
He had three teeth knocked
out two weeks ago.

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,911
Infection could have
led to oral bleeding.

46
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,572
Not without
continuing dental pain.

47
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,344
Then he took
an elbow to the gut,

48
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,510
which caused
an esophageal tear.

49
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:04,087
Chase, CT the patient,
check for sarcoid.

50
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,090
Adams, sputum cultures and
serologies for psittacosis.

51
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,922
Taub, I'd tell you
why I think your theory

52
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,189
is not just wrong
but ill-conceived,

53
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:16,290
but it's more fun to prove it by
having you check the stool for blood.

54
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,099
Now while we wait for the
stool fairy, I'm a man down.

55
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:23,697
So if you want to drop your
pants and hit the ice.

56
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,874
<i>The faster you guys
can do this, the better.</i>

57
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,379
The NHL's been sniffing around,

58
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,882
and being in the hospitals not really
helping my marketability, so...

59
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:34,111
You have to be pretty
good to get called up.

60
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,948
Yeah, leading the league
in penalty minutes.

61
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,613
And visits to the ER, not
counting the ones you've caused.

62
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,485
Not a hockey fan, I gather?

63
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,925
I am, that's the point. Fighting
cheapens a great sport.

64
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,624
Oh, come on. That's like saying
passing cheapens football.

65
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,790
It's part of the game.

66
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,458
I don't cause injuries.

67
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:50,626
They're self-inflicted?

68
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:51,896
No, I prevent them.

69
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,933
Hake the hits, so the
smaller guys don't have to.

70
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,134
I thought you'd
appreciate that.

71
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,759
Neighbor's baby again?

72
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,323
I could hear it
through earplugs,

73
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,092
two pillows,
and three sleeping pills.

74
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,095
Hmm.

75
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,936
What is wrong with you?

76
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,339
I just said, "Hmm."

77
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,935
You're trying to figure out
some deeper significance

78
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,378
to my having a couple
of crappy nights.

79
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,450
Which one of us is analyzing
the word "hmm" here?

80
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,554
Fine. I'm sorry.

81
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,180
Apology accepted.

82
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,826
However, it's not the crying
that's keeping you awake.

83
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:54,730
The sound of a needy child is
stirring your paternal juices.

84
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:58,030
The sound of a needy
child at 112 decibels

85
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,798
has stirred my inner murderer.
Don't mess with me.

86
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:04,308
Explain the stains on your shirt.
You're lactating.

87
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,872
The fact that
you're the only fruit

88
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,379
on your family tree
is getting to you.

89
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,490
It's not a big deal So I'll
probably never be a clad.

90
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,720
It sucks. I'll lose
a little sleep, but...

91
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:26,161
You're not supposed to feel
bad when you dodge a bullet.

92
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,698
It's like you've
got survivor's guilt.

93
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,700
There are actually things
in this world

94
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,326
that give life
even more meaning

95
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,927
than soap operas
and monster trucks.

96
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,432
And we happen to be missing
out on at least one of them.

97
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,070
You remember the falconer?

98
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,408
Beth?

99
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,953
You dated two falconers?

100
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,113
<i>Yes, Beth.</i>

101
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,752
The night the two
of you split up,

102
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,796
you came around to my place,

103
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,864
wallowing in
self-pity and tequila.

104
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,101
You passed out.

105
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,435
She called that night. Asked
me to give you a message.

106
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,370
She said she was pregnant.

107
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,712
Which, God and Planned
Parenthood willing,

108
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,084
means you are the father
of an 11-year-old.

109
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:31,562
I told you the next morning.
Hypothetically.

110
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,290
I asked you how you'd feel
if Beth had gotten pregnant,

111
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:39,962
and you said, and I quote, "It would
be the worst mistake of my life."

112
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,801
And scene.

113
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,437
Two performances Sunday,
dark Mondays?

114
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,917
Just as well.

115
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,689
I want to kill my mother.

116
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,923
My Popo's on her own

117
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,301
and my mother always needs
me to take care of her.

118
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,704
Well, you could
kill Popo instead.

119
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,677
I have to take her shopping, to
her friends, to Atlantic City.

120
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:25,272
I love her, but every
night, every weekend...

121
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,840
And only if there
was some solution,

122
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,511
some place where
you could live.

123
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:30,815
That's not there.

124
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:35,189
My mom would freak. It would be
the ultimate sign of disrespect.

125
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,022
Okay. Then stay.

126
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,059
And maybe you'd consider
not bitching about it?

127
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,829
Not everyone's lucky enough
to have your independence.

128
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:47,833
Don't worry. When you lose your
family, you'll have ll, too.

129
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,835
He doesn't have sarcoid.

130
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,743
Look at that That's his spleen.

131
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,974
I know, but he's
gotten it supersized.

132
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,713
Deep vein thrombosis, caused by any one
of his many injuries or surgeries.

133
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:02,980
Leukemia's a better fit.

134
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,683
We have a guy who is punishing
his body on a daily basis.

135
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,553
Don't you think that's a more
likely cause than cancer?

136
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,217
No, because she doesn't
have an agenda.

137
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,492
Well, that was incredibly
unprofessional.

138
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,188
Although, it's
really Taub's fault.

139
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,360
If you're not prepared to
slam her into the board,

140
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,994
she's got no reason
not to go after you.

141
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,840
Might I suggest pulling her
jersey over her head first?

142
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,241
We should get an ultrasound
for DVT and WBC for leukemia.

143
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,209
You think I could have cancer?

144
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,718
More likely it's just a DVT.

145
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,347
This is my agent.
I gotta take this.

146
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,915
Yeah.

147
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,757
Give me some good news, Kenny.

148
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,559
I thought you said "any day".

149
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,101
Okay. All right.

150
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,966
<i>L gotta go...</i>

151
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,464
I called Beth.

152
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,637
I have
an 11-year-old son.

153
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,682
Liver failure could
alter hormone levels,

154
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,656
cause abnormal
breast development.

155
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:52,753
Alcoholism. We should search
his home and locker room.

156
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,197
Note that the person who
wants to search the home

157
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,631
didn't sleep in one last night.

158
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,660
You have the imprint of a
seatbelt buckle on your cheek.

159
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,366
I got in a fight
with my mother.

160
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,335
She hit you with a seatbelt?

161
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,639
It could be hemochromatosis.

162
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,009
Explains
the liver and the spleen,

163
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,548
but hemoptysis is a stretch.

164
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:12,708
What about leptospirosis?

165
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:13,875
That's a good fit.

166
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,509
If you ignore the fact
that he's a pro athlete

167
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,110
who looks like
the Incredible Hulk,

168
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,657
which means he's got to be on
steroids, which is a better fit.

169
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,453
All we really know
for sure is that

170
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,790
it was his evil job
that caused the problems.

171
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,490
Yes, I don't like him. Doesn't
mean my judgment's affected.

172
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,227
Maybe. Let's take a look
at the instant replay.

173
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:33,536
This is the hit that
precipitated Booby Orr's fight.

174
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,367
Dirty or clean?

175
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,474
- The hit was clean.
- Really?

176
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,881
The guy released the puck at
least a second before the hit.

177
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,881
We have a difference
of opinion. That's all.

178
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,714
Absolutely.

179
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,315
Maybe she's as biased as you.

180
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,323
Or maybe the entire league is.

181
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,986
After review, the league disciplinary
commissioner ruled the hit

182
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,554
illegal and dangerous, and suspended
the player for three games.

183
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,224
Adams and Taub, run
antibody titers for lepto.

184
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:06,236
Chase and Park, check out the
home, the locker room for booze,

185
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:09,170
steroids and
Taub's objectivity.

186
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,676
At least you're free.

187
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:15,837
You gonna get your own place?

188
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,840
If I can find a place
I can afford, so no.

189
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,524
If you want, you can crash at my place.
Got a spare bedroom.

190
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,855
That might be kind of weird.

191
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,253
I live in an apartment,
not a dungeon.

192
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:37,028
It's just two single
people, opposite sex.

193
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,601
Your bedroom door has
a lock on the inside.

194
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,612
Hey, if you prefer
your car, be my guest.

195
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,716
Scrip for ganciclovir.

196
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:02,957
If his neighbor has mono,
it could mean he has mono.

197
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:07,395
If he has mono, explains
his spleen and hemoptysis.

198
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:11,401
And it's caused by the Epstein-Barr
virus, which explains his liver.

199
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,135
And my moonroof leaks.

200
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,238
Thank you.

201
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:25,915
Why don't we just assume
that you're not the dad?

202
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,511
Well, either you're the dad

203
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,420
or she cheated on
you with your dad.

204
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:34,685
Oh!

205
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,158
Sand art.
I used to love this.

206
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,320
He's bitter, not
mentally handicapped.

207
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,264
Who knows what Beth
told him about you'?

208
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:47,270
At worst, you're a rapist.
At best, you're a rapist.

209
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,171
Maybe she said
I was a dead war hero.

210
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:53,506
Raised by a lunatic mother
and abandoned by his father.

211
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,045
Oh, I know, squirrel handcuffs.

212
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,512
You think he's
got any of those?

213
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:00,106
If you really wanted me to do
nothing with this information,

214
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,344
then why did you give it to me?

215
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,785
Because you were
pining for a kid

216
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,449
and you deserved to know
that you already had one.

217
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,516
But your paternal cravings are
more theoretical than applied.

218
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,459
You want vicarious immortality

219
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,964
more than you want
a lifelong burden.

220
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,967
You're assuming he's
gonna be a nightmare.

221
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,798
What if he's a good kid?

222
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,806
He's a kid. Best you can hope
for is he's a nightmare.

223
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:27,037
House, I'm not naive. I realize that
this thing could go very badly,

224
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:30,979
but the point is my son wants to
meet me, and I want to meet him.

225
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,541
Popo, I presume.

226
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,751
Hey. I let myself in.

227
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,947
This is...
We've met.

228
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,519
I thought the whole point of
this was to get away from Popo.

229
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,097
My dad's getting a cyst removed

230
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,632
and my mother had to
take him to the clinic.

231
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,929
Don't worry, she'll
be gone in an hour.

232
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:28,062
I'm not worried because
it's not my issue.

233
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,603
She seems awfully quiet.

234
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,574
You haven't seen her drunk.

235
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:49,886
Bobby?

236
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,302
I found him crying
in the fetal position.

237
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,606
It's not a new symptom.

238
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,338
He's crying because
his liver failure

239
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,506
threw his hormones
out of whack.

240
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,777
Aside from the crying, he's
actually recovering nicely.

241
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,442
Aside from the guy
in the book depository,

242
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:18,114
the Kennedys had
a lovely trip to Dallas.

243
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,348
Repetitive blows to the head

244
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,925
can cause chronic
traumatic encephalopathy,

245
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,358
the symptoms of which are
aggressive behavior and depression.

246
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,487
So your theory is that
his aggressive behavior

247
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,190
caused his aggressive behavior?

248
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,324
He's not depressed,
he's just bummed,

249
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,266
because he knows
he's a talentless moron

250
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,100
who's only one lost fight
away from being a barista.

251
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,775
I understand that can get
to a guy after a while.

252
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,436
If he quits being an enforcer,
it could save his life.

253
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,309
You don't want
to save his life.

254
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,645
You want to kill his career.

255
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,442
I moved into Chase's apartment.

256
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,021
He knows. He was staring
at our matching cups.

257
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,285
I told you
we should have split up.

258
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,488
We're not having sex.
With each other.

259
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,988
Yet.
Yes.

260
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,156
Yes?

261
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:08,131
I just mean no one knows the future
right now, so we don't really know...

262
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:15,909
The only conclusive test
for CTE is post-mortem.

263
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:19,211
But an MRI of his brain could
reveal white matter disintegrity,

264
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,751
which is the effect of CTE.

265
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,582
Why'? Are you trying
to sleep with her?

266
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,849
'Cause a simpler technique
is just to ask.

267
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,821
I was doing something nice. No.

268
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:30,690
That doesn't fit.

269
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,092
He's only had three
concussions since he was 10.

270
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,425
It's not enough to cause CTE.

271
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,193
Three reported concussions.

272
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,324
These guys are taught in high
school how to dupe the tests.

273
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,667
Guilt?
This is really insulting.

274
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,936
It's not guilt.
Park is a friend.

275
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:45,734
So it's guilt.

276
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:50,405
Chase convinced you to leave Mommy
and now he feels responsible.

277
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,276
No MRI.

278
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,181
Do a psych eval, if he doesn't start
weeping again, send him home.

279
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:04,695
Dr. Wilson?

280
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,023
Duncan?

281
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:11,801
James.

282
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,098
Nice to meet you.

283
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,063
It's nice to meet you.

284
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,404
Um...

285
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:23,646
How are you doing?

286
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:24,874
Good.

287
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,382
Good.

288
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,913
I got you this.

289
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,117
Oh.

290
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,391
Thank you.

291
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,388
Go ahead.
Okay.

292
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,400
It's got three
games built-in,

293
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,235
but you can download
more from the website.

294
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,234
I know.

295
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,437
You already have one.

296
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,439
I can always use a backup.

297
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,309
Hi. Can I start you
with something to drink?

298
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:58,905
Just water, please.

299
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,246
You got a GameDeck?
Way to go, Dad.

300
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,616
According to your psych eval,

301
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:13,152
the only thing happier
than you is Disneyland.

302
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,129
I'm sorry you had to see
me like that last night.

303
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:19,634
I'm just upset about being in the
hospital, I'm on some weird meds.

304
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,433
But they must be working, because
I'm feeling a lot better now.

305
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:28,634
Depression could be the symptom
of a serious illness, CTE.

306
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,806
Yeah. My aunt sends me every
article she can find on it.

307
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,007
Then you know
it could kill you.

308
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,846
In the long run,
like a lot of things.

309
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,941
You might be right.

310
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,147
And an MRI could confirm that.

311
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:42,783
I have enough evidence of head
trauma in my file already, so...

312
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:50,965
My mom said you had trouble maintaining
relationships with normal people.

313
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:54,961
She also said
you were a nice guy.

314
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,665
I always figured she was lying

315
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,800
'cause she didn't want me
to hate my deadbeat dad.

316
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:00,970
I didn't know.

317
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,639
I know, now.

318
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,681
You're a bright kid.

319
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,756
Thanks to you.
Thanks to my mom,

320
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,722
I'm also a big,
soft-hearted wuss.

321
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,150
I think you may have gotten
that from both of us.

322
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,667
I got to go, but it was
really nice meeting you.

323
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:28,501
It was nice
meeting you, Duncan.

324
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:31,698
You want to hang out again?

325
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,039
Absolutely.
Tonight?

326
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,171
Tonight?

327
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,678
Well, I... There's...

328
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,580
That would be great.

329
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:49,856
Okay. I'll text you.

330
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,968
Thank you. How'd you
talk him into it?

331
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,063
He agreed once I
promised him anonymity.

332
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,871
Mr. and Mrs. Doe liked the
name John, apparently.

333
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,707
Unfortunately, we just wasted his
time and proved House right.

334
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,279
Nothing?

335
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,141
What about that?
That's an artifact.

336
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,549
That's a density.

337
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,322
I know you think
I'm convincing myself,

338
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,618
but this brain has
been hammered for years,

339
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:25,093
meaning evidence may be
subtle, but it's there.

340
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,961
<i>Meaning you
see what you want to see.</i>

341
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,635
<i>Unless, of course, Chase is an
idiot and I do have brain damage.</i>

342
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,004
Patient's stroking out.

343
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,637
<i>Chase.
Can you get me out of”.</i>

344
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:43,975
<i>Oh...</i>

345
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:46,840
<i>Hello?</i>

346
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:56,626
The good news is ifs
isolated ophthalmoplegia,

347
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,355
which means he
didn't have a stroke.

348
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,863
Bad news is Taub was right.
You're still sick.

349
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,028
I said "right",
not "competent".

350
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,829
Bursts your CTE bubble. You're
gonna need a whole new theory

351
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:11,374
to keep Uncle Jesse and his
Olsen Twins on the bench.

352
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,672
Can we discuss my
incompetence somewhere else?

353
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,482
Dr. House. Could I talk
to you for a minute?

354
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,026
Could be neurosyphilis.

355
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,195
He's only 22.

356
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:43,466
And he's been on the
road since he was 14.

357
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,908
So he was trash even
before he was trash?

358
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,672
Are you curious
about what he wanted?

359
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,839
I assume he wanted me
off the case,

360
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:53,349
and you told him I was hit
in the head as a child,

361
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:56,352
and your mother made you
promise to take care of me.

362
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,479
He was doing
what he always does.

363
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,854
Sticking up for the little guy.

364
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,323
He told me to apologize to you,

365
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,887
or he would
excrete down my throat.

366
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:09,724
I'm paraphrasing.

367
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,359
So if he should ask,
I was a gentleman,

368
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,062
or I will excrete
down your throat.

369
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,662
Microscopic polyangiitis fits.

370
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,104
We should start
plasmapheresis immediately.

371
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,679
We need to run an ANCA
panel to confirm first.

372
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,737
Putting him on plasmapheresis
could make him bleed out.

373
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,248
MPA can progress quickly.

374
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,547
We may not have time before
it reaches his lungs.

375
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:34,215
I think you're right, thus
confirming my objectivity.

376
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,189
Start the treatment.

377
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,196
Miserable yet?

378
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:53,702
He's polite, well-adjusted,
and a straight-A student.

379
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,940
Which means
he doesn't need you.

380
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,947
So why don't you get out
while the butterfly effect

381
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:00,574
is still in the cocoon stage.

382
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:01,980
I'm making him dinner.

383
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,213
You don't make
an 11-year-old dinner.

384
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,882
You give him ajar
of peanut butter.

385
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,050
It'll be fine.

386
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,286
I could give this kid
a quinoa salad

387
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:11,725
and he would eat it
just to be nice.

388
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,424
'Cause he's a gutless
placater, just like his dad.

389
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:15,588
He's nice.

390
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:18,394
This is a terrible idea.

391
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,492
Because we like each other?

392
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:23,266
Yes. Because of the statement,
"We like each other."

393
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,669
You've known him 25 minutes.

394
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,471
All you know about him is that
he'd lie about a quinoa salad,

395
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,806
whatever the hell that is.

396
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,181
You're jealous
of an 11-year-old

397
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,581
because you are
an 11-year-old.

398
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,795
So tell me about yourself.

399
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:52,368
I mean you're smart, you're
nice, but what else?

400
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,802
I don't know.
I'm a kid.

401
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,997
Right.

402
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,472
What are you looking for?

403
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,678
Nothing.

404
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,782
You want peanut butter?

405
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,614
Do you have prosciutto?

406
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,053
You like prosciutto?
I'm weird.

407
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,719
No! No, I like it, too.

408
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,797
I've got some in the fridge.
How about goat cheese?

409
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:23,357
I love goat cheese.

410
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,174
I think that was the
best pizza I ever had.

411
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,379
It was the hint of Dijon.

412
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,709
Do you have any aunts or
uncles or grandparents?

413
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,385
My mom got into some stupid
fight with my grandfather.

414
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,856
They all kind of cut us off.

415
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:49,915
Hmm.

416
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,995
Are you talking
to your parents?

417
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:57,330
Yes, and they're going to be very
surprised and excited to meet you.

418
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,096
That's awesome.

419
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,899
<i>You have
arrived at your destination,</i>

420
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,705
Well...
Thanks for the pizza.

421
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:09,074
Sure. Sure. I mean, it was
great to spend time with you.

422
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,872
I love you, Dad.

423
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,540
It can't be easy
doing what you do.

424
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,944
I mean, do you love it?

425
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,044
Is it fun?

426
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,621
I had my own plastic surgery
practice, making lots of money.

427
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:57,717
But I wasn't happy. It wasn't
what I went to med school for.

428
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:15,838
Every winter, my dad would flood
the backyard and make a rink.

429
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,505
I was Lemieux, my little
brother was Gretzky.

430
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:23,417
I was good. I won the NDHA scoring
title three years in a row.

431
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,322
I kept getting bigger
and stronger and better.

432
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:30,654
Until I didn't.

433
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:35,460
My Juniors coach told me that if
I wanted to stay on the team,

434
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,965
that I'd have to use my size.

435
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:41,530
Every game, I got
less and less ice time,

436
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:46,167
until it was all fighting
and no hockey.

437
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,774
There's something
going on with my arms.

438
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:02,656
I can't feel them! Doctor,
I can't feel my arms.

439
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,328
Patient's arms
are now paralyzed.

440
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,831
ANCA panel was negative.
It's not MPA.

441
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:12,367
Lyme disease
could cause paralysis,

442
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,300
if he was hunting,
he'd be exposed to ticks.

443
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,135
No target rash
or cardiac involvement.

444
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,640
Roomies with benefits
keeping you up?

445
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,838
Cribbage. I played
with Park's Popo.

446
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,844
Is that two separate events?

447
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:30,681
Her grandmother. ALS could
explain the symptoms.

448
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,811
Sensory involvement
rules out ALS.

449
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,221
Okay, now this is interesting.

450
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:35,815
We'll get back to the
patient in a second.

451
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,861
Your issue is
the same as Wilson's.

452
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:41,863
Except you're haunted by the
pitter-patter of tiny skanks.

453
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:44,524
You don't feel guilty about getting
Park thrown out of her home.

454
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,535
You feel guilty about all the
women that you've screwed over.

455
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,367
My mother needs 1,000
bucks for snow tires.

456
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,736
Park's a friend, Popo's fun.

457
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,778
Paralysis has gone
from his face to his arms,

458
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:59,610
meaning it's descending, which
is the hallmark of botulism.

459
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:03,449
So it was something he ate.
How innocuous.

460
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,749
You've overcome your
bias by reversing it.

461
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,290
The only problem is that being
in love with the patient

462
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,951
is just as judgmental
as being in hate.

463
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,050
We didn't find
any contaminated...

464
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,256
No contaminated food,
I'm not an idiot.

465
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:17,596
But what if it's not from
ingesting, but from injecting?

466
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:20,761
He was treated for intractable muscle
spasms by the team's trainers.

467
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,964
Sometimes they use Botox.

468
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:24,939
We need to start the antitoxin.

469
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,032
The antitoxin could
cause anaphylaxis.

470
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,079
We need to test first
to confirm.

471
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:30,475
As if to prove my point.

472
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:33,106
Last time you said there
wasn't enough time to test

473
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,741
prior to a more
dangerous treatment.

474
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,547
It's a different situation, a different
symptom, a different diagnosis.

475
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:40,920
Different emotion.
Give him the antitoxin.

476
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,957
Anything?

477
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:50,556
No adverse effects.

478
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,747
Chase let me move in with him
to getaway from my grandmother,

479
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:09,944
then he practically let my grandmother
move in with the both of us.

480
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:13,113
He's being way more than nice.

481
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,191
Then which answer is it?

482
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:19,194
Chase feels guilty for
pushing you to move out'?

483
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,456
He didn't push me.

484
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,428
- Guilt about skanks?
- He loves skanks.

485
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:23,761
It's not the other option.

486
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:26,027
There are people that like me,

487
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,831
people who even
want to sleep with me.

488
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:30,099
Some of them are
even good looking.

489
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:31,606
That good looking?

490
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,039
Did you see that?

491
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,714
You're feeling something?

492
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:49,551
Yeah.

493
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:56,495
I could give you crap for
making me wait 11 years,

494
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,998
but instead I'm gonna thank you

495
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:01,299
for not making me
wait another 11.

496
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,399
Every little girl wants a pony

497
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,373
until they have
to clean up after it.

498
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:09,742
You think I'm gonna quit on this?
On an 11-year-old?

499
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:12,145
The only relationship you haven't
quit on has been with me.

500
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,707
Hmm. A needy,
truculent narcissist.

501
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,980
I think it's been the perfect
training for parenthood.

502
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,917
That's not even close.

503
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:24,324
This is the rest of your life.

504
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,857
If you screw this up,
you don't get to run away.

505
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,499
You get to ruin
both your lives.

506
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,034
This is a bigger responsibility

507
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,663
than any you've ever taken
on, and screwed up.

508
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,172
I know.

509
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,941
That's why I'm so
excited about it.

510
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:54,014
You're really happier doing this
than looking at boobs all day'?

511
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,184
Luckily, I get patients like
you every now and again

512
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,523
who let me
re-experience the joy.

513
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,028
You know the best
part of my day

514
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,590
is when I'm sitting
in that penalty box

515
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,295
after I beat someone up.

516
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:10,737
It's the only time
I know I'm safe.

517
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,933
Think Lemieux
ever felt that way?

518
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,101
I'm not going back.

519
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,200
To hockey?

520
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,372
To enforcing.
Whatever that costs.

521
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:21,779
Good for you.

522
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,443
Oh!

523
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,453
First goal for
the Pocket Rocket.

524
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:29,392
Bobby?

525
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,657
We need a team in here!

526
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:43,236
He's completely paralyzed and he
tested negative for botulism.

527
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:50,775
I am now accepting long shots.

528
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,173
Polio?

529
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:54,341
Some kids were
never vaccinated.

530
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:57,909
Unless they played sports all their
lives and had two physicals a year.

531
00:32:58,743 --> 00:32:59,915
How about MLD?

532
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,252
TAUB; That's a bad fit.

533
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,158
I say that not because there's
no treatment for MLD,

534
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:05,421
but because ifs a bad fit.

535
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,087
His cognitive abilities
are unaffected.

536
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,999
Prion disease could explain the
waxing and waning symptoms.

537
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,590
The test for prions
is a brain biopsy.

538
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,500
And given his history, there's
got to be brain swelling.

539
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,698
We can't risk drilling
into his skull.

540
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:17,933
Pretty sure we can.

541
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:22,273
We also could keep talking until we can
find an answer we all can agree on.

542
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,941
What, all of us? Those of us who
love him, those who hate him?

543
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,017
Those who don't give
a crap about him or you?

544
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,279
Or I could just discuss it
on my own with Foreman.

545
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,549
He's not your friend.

546
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:34,453
I get it' he's a patient.

547
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:37,390
I'm not... He never
had your back.

548
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:41,953
He didn't insist that
I apologize to you.

549
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,401
He asked me to take
you off the case.

550
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,407
Biopsy his brain.

551
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:03,842
Hey, Dad.

552
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:04,910
He?'

553
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:10,217
Sorry I'm late. Got in a fight
with my mom She is such a tool.

554
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:11,692
I'm sure she means well.

555
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:15,593
She wants to open a reserve in Costa
Rica for rescued birds of prey.

556
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,901
But how serious is she?

557
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:24,201
From my recollection, she used
to talk about doing a lot.

558
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:27,333
Yeah, but she bought
plane tickets for Monday.

559
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:36,014
Well, Costa Rica is beautiful.

560
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,179
And the schools are
supposed to be great.

561
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:41,018
Oh! I'm not going. It's her
stupid dream, not mine.

562
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,187
Then what will you do?

563
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,358
Uh...

564
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:56,100
I thought maybe
I could stay with you?

565
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,466
Your place is only three
miles away from my school.

566
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,805
I can bus it every day.

567
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,744
And I do my own laundry.
I keep my room tidy.

568
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,975
Duncan, this...

569
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:11,213
This is very sudden.

570
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,550
I know. I'm sorry.

571
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,764
Please don't send me
to the jungle.

572
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,138
If it's okay with your
mother, it's okay with me.

573
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:46,283
Take me off the case.

574
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,850
I've obviously completely
lost my objectivity.

575
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,929
I'm not helping.
I'm not even neutral.

576
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:56,096
Agreed.

577
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,999
So why shouldn't
I take you off all my cases?

578
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,093
Because you were right.
I hate bullies.

579
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:03,997
You work for me.

580
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,096
You're not a bully.

581
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,767
Pretty sure I am, dickwad.

582
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,971
I've known a lot of bullies, people
who didn't like me because I'm short,

583
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,171
people who didn't like me
because I'm Jewish.

584
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,715
Yeah, I get it, there's a long
list of reasons not to like you.

585
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:17,446
You relentlessly mock, but it's
not for self-aggrandizement,

586
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,854
it's because ideas are
bigger than feelings.

587
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:25,057
At least that's what
I choose to believe.

588
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:29,121
I also thought you had the side
effect of desensitizing me.

589
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,631
You little hebe.

590
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,498
Here are some ideas for you.

591
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:43,135
You screwed up. You kept on screwing up.
Everything you said is true.

592
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:48,648
Except it doesn't mean
you walk away.

593
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,821
You just learn
to trust nothing.

594
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:58,351
Everything you think you feel,
everything you think you know,

595
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:02,825
you question every call,
play through every whistle.

596
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:09,563
I just had a light bulb.

597
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:11,836
Maybe.

598
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,168
You can trust light bulbs.

599
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,886
Stop.
It's not prions.

600
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,684
Epstein-Barr gave him mono, it also
gave him Miller Fisher syndrome.

601
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,754
The plasmapheresis
played through the whistle.

602
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:37,800
We gave it to him for MPA, but when
he got worse, we took him off.

603
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:40,392
When he got better, we thought
it was the antitoxin,

604
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:43,369
but it was actually the
plasmapheresis still working.

605
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:47,206
We had the right treatment,
just the wrong diagnosis.

606
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,368
It was my metaphor
that solved the case.

607
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,739
Put him back on plasmapheresis.
He'll be fine.

608
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,282
Nice save.

609
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,752
Didn't quite make up for being
a sieve the rest of the game.

610
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,895
Ex-girlfriend's
baby again?

611
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,605
His mother is moving
to Costa Rica,

612
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,640
he asked if he could
move in with me...

613
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:20,800
and I said yes.

614
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:30,910
Well, it's only
six or seven years.

615
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:33,581
Unless he can't
get into college,

616
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,148
in which case it's more a
matter of your life expectancy.

617
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:39,660
I said yes, knowing I'm not
remotely ready for that,

618
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:43,198
knowing he's not ready to be
separated from his mother.

619
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:46,030
This isn't the act of
a mature, rational adult.

620
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,300
I can't do this, House.

621
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,969
You were right.

622
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:02,015
I have an idea that can make
this entire problem go away.

623
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:05,644
Yes, I really want to hear your
clever late-term abortion joke.

624
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,350
You were right about everything.
This is life.

625
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:11,052
It's real.
It doesn't just go away.

626
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,394
None of that is true.

627
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,236
He?'

628
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,400
Duncan.

629
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:31,170
Actually, it's Wendel, one "L".

630
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:38,411
If you're gonna get pissy,
remember, it was House's idea.

631
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:44,718
You're an actor?

632
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,856
Five commercials, and a
recurring on Days of our Lives.

633
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:56,561
You were regretting not having
kids, so I gave you one.

634
00:39:57,362 --> 00:40:01,174
Thereby rendering you regret-free.
It's a priceless gift.

635
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,677
Get out.
Well, it's not priceless.

636
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,509
He charges SAG minimum...

637
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,412
Get out!

638
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,511
Chillax, Dad.

639
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,621
Can you do an Australian accent?

640
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,544
I just got the call.

641
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:46,454
Three-year deal,
2.1 million.

642
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:58,390
What about the flooded backyard
and pretending to be Lemieux'?

643
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,301
That's why I took it.

644
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,902
After all I did to get here,

645
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,341
half a dream is
better than nothing.

646
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:13,982
Maybe my new coach will see
what my Juniors coach didn't.

647
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,018
That'd be nice.

648
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,277
I'm not sleeping with you.

649
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,705
That's a shame.

650
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,121
This is about Popo.

651
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:59,226
She's not sleeping
with me either, right?

652
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:02,127
You were jealous
of me, my family.

653
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:14,075
Maybe you've got too much
and I've got too little.

654
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,382
I might sleep
with you after all.

655
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:59,021
The woman that I called,
that was really Beth?

656
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,612
Found her on Facebook.

657
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,089
How much did she charge?

658
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:05,752
Nothing. She's still
pissed at you.

659
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,063
<i>Can you pass the bacon?</i>

660
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,361
I thought you liked prosciutto.

661
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,424
Nobody likes prosciutto.
