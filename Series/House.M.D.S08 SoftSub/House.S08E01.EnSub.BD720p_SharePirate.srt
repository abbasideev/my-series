1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:06,283
Given goodish behavior

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,847
and eight of
12 months time served,

3
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,286
we have the discretion to
grant parole Friday the 10th,

4
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,187
five days from now.

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,783
Are you sorry about
what you did?

6
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:19,957
Yes.

7
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:25,797
Yes?

8
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:29,301
That's the correct answer,
isn't it?

9
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,198
Are you trying to annoy us?

10
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:34,643
No. I'm just trying to give you the
answers you need to cover your asses,

11
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,146
fill out your forms
and let me out of here.

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,916
We need you to show us remorse.

13
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,183
Is that how our system works?

14
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:42,816
Release the best actors?

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,253
I shudder lo think what
that world would be like.

16
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,756
You drove your car into
your ex-girlfriend's house

17
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,656
and then fled the country
for three months.

18
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:52,319
I knew that her daughter was at
grandma's, like every Friday.

19
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,695
And I saw everyone else
move into the living room...

20
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:56,230
They could have moved back.

21
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,599
Which I would have noticed since I
was driving right towards them.

22
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,000
Shut up.

23
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:02,266
We got an order to
reduce overcrowding.

24
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,674
But let me be clear.

25
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:06,244
You mouth off to one guard

26
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,904
we catch you with a single
cafeteria tray in your cell,

27
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,539
you break any rules
I don't even remember,

28
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:14,118
you can park your ass here
for four more months.

29
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:18,684
So forget being sorry. Can you
stay out of trouble for five days?

30
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:22,786
Yes.

31
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:11,899
Gather up for meds.

32
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,069
Asofa.

33
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,751
Yeah.

34
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,256
Why you keep helping him out?

35
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,428
Yeah. Why would
I wanna make sure

36
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:34,591
that my homicidal cell mate is
taking the right anti-psychotics'?

37
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,531
House.

38
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,314
Mendelson.

39
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,385
He's on 80 milligrams
of propranolol, this is 40.

40
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,062
You're right. Sorry.

41
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,895
No worries. I like
my nurses naughty.

42
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,139
You know, I'm starting
to think, Mendelson,

43
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,801
you just really like
the taste of my spit.

44
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:24,244
Hey, House, check
out our new brand.

45
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:29,145
You've really got a thing
for swastikas, Mendelson.

46
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,156
Like an ironic thing?

47
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,854
It's a German name.

48
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:36,258
So is House, and I'm Jewish.

49
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,491
Nah. I'm a black
93'! Q? p$Y...

50
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,215
Knight to king's bishop three.

51
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,677
Queen to king's bishop seven.

52
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,216
Hey. You're
House, right?

53
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:12,185
I got these weird pains in
my elbows and in my knees.

54
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,233
You know what's weirder is how
the clinic is a large room,

55
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,961
and you somehow
confused me with it.

56
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,567
Well, to be fair, I am large.

57
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:27,771
<i>M N R H.</i>

58
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,541
I realize this is probably
a rhetorical question.

59
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,415
Why are you stealing my stuff?

60
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,646
Hey, House. I heard
you're on short time.

61
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,252
You won't need this.

62
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,154
You heard about my parole.

63
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:44,218
But not about my violent reactions
when people steal my tuna.

64
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,122
- Put it back.
- Nuh-uh.

65
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,561
Really?

66
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,896
You're stepping to a guy who
outweighs you by 50 pounds

67
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,805
and who is carrying a cane
which, while prison-approved,

68
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:01,243
will still cause some issues
if inserted into your colon.

69
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,647
Yeah, like you
losing your parole.

70
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:06,911
And you ain't gonna
rat me out neither,

71
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:10,250
'cause you don't wanna get a snitch jacket
and wind up shanked in the showers.

72
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:14,318
So you're just gonna
let me walk out of here.

73
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,773
You wanna get back
at these guys,

74
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,370
get out alive on Friday.

75
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,682
Okay'? Now,
go to work, House.

76
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:48,022
And that was checkmate, right?
Yep.

77
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,788
I heard you're on
that short time, House.

78
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,793
If you like tuna,
you're a little late.

79
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,729
I want your stereo
and your headphones.

80
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,634
It can wait till
you finish your work.

81
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,639
Drop it off in my cell.

82
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:32,167
99.9. I'm gonna start
him on ceftriaxone.

83
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,168
Good catch. I might
have missed that.

84
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,012
It's not gonorrhea.

85
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,250
I didn't say it was.

86
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:54,018
Not out loud. You're just figuring a joint
pain plus fever plus a low lifestyle

87
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,923
equals a ceftriaxone
prescription.

88
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,518
So you saying I got the clap?

89
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,531
I've only been in here one
week, my girlfriend's clean.

90
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,622
I ain't got
a girlfriend in here.

91
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,893
How do you know
about ceftriaxone?

92
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,369
House used to be a doctor.

93
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,535
Not going back.

94
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,475
And that look of shock
is elitist and offensive.

95
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,305
Doctors can be degenerates.
This is America.

96
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,882
There's subtle eyebrow loss.

97
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,917
It's lupus.

98
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,985
Well, there's no discoid
or malar rash on his face.

99
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:35,259
Which would be dispositive
if he was just a giant head.

100
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:38,498
He's got a point, but
I'll let you make the call.

101
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,798
No, there's no reason to
search for a bodily rash

102
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,306
since lupus doesn't
usually present that way.

103
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,773
"Usually"?

104
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,912
Well, I guess that's good
enough for prison work.

105
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,786
You don't write people up
for mouthing off, do you'?

106
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,749
Not usually.

107
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,091
You don't want to
mess with Stomper.

108
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:14,796
He didn't get that name because
he's a fan of Santa's reindeer.

109
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,811
You think one of Santa's
reindeer was called Stomper'?

110
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,038
You're missing my point.

111
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,046
I'm not gonna listen to a guy
who can't name the reindeer.

112
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,549
You saw what happened
in the yard with Diaz.

113
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,111
He barely said a couple
of words and set the boy off.

114
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,126
Oh, no.

115
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,957
I know that look.

116
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,552
Hey, Stamper.
Where's my stereo?

117
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,589
I brought it to your cell.
It ain't there.

118
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,248
I was just getting
to that part.

119
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,260
Rollo followed me in
and took it.

120
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,996
- No way Rollo diss me like that.
- Way.

121
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,433
I don't want to start any rumors, but...
But what?

122
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,071
He was all,
"I can take Stomper,"

123
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,699
and I was all,
"How come?"

124
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:28,108
<i>And he was all, “Cause of how
Diaz kicked his ass last month."</i>

125
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:32,347
In fact, he actually called
you "Stompee," with an "E."

126
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,441
I think his gist was...

127
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,180
You took my stereo?

128
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:39,348
Get out of my house,
Stamper, I ain't got no stereo.

129
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,450
What's this, then?

130
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:42,686
What? I didn't
put that there!

131
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,456
You gonna lie to my face,
you lying son of a bitch!

132
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,553
What?
I didn't do anything!

133
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,529
Next time
I will take your stereo!

134
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,861
That's enough!

135
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,224
Ow!

136
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,747
That was stupid.

137
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,551
Is that like a
synonym for "clever"?

138
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:15,819
Time they get out of solitary,

139
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,385
I'll be teaching physics
at the University of Fiji.

140
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,059
You have four days left.

141
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,571
How many more tricks
do you got?

142
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:22,820
Don't.

143
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,621
Another pet?

144
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,892
This is gonna end
badly. Again.

145
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,302
Remember, we talked about this?

146
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,671
Or at least I talked
and you stared at me eerily?

147
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:44,573
I think it was eerily. Eerily
felt like the best-case scenario.

148
00:11:58,651 --> 00:11:59,823
Hey.

149
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,833
Take off your shirt
so I can find the rash.

150
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,503
Now you wanna help me?

151
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,360
'Cause that doctor
didn't believe you?

152
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:12,272
Well, if you could think of a better way to
prove that she's an idiot, I'm all ears.

153
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,571
Now, let's get this over with.

154
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,838
Yeah.

155
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,383
That's Nicole.

156
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,249
She lives at her mom's now, on
account that she lost her job.

157
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,688
Her mom hates me,

158
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,090
so she can't visit, she
ain't accepting my calls.

159
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,461
That's what happens when
you date a 12-year-old.

160
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,527
You don't believe me?

161
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:41,299
Belief implies a level of giving a
crap that I'm never gonna achieve.

162
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,805
Pull down your pants.

163
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:59,550
He?'

164
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:03,059
It's not that I was trying to prove
you're an idiot or anything'

165
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,720
but lupus boy and I were
at the beach this morning,

166
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,561
and I noticed a rash
on his left thigh.

167
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,830
I checked you out.

168
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,897
You were a pretty big deal.

169
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,064
What went wrong?

170
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,169
Something very obvious
and very boring.

171
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,469
Drug related?

172
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,514
Forging prescriptions?

173
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,808
You're good.

174
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,580
Just like lupus boy will be, when
you start him on prednisone.

175
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,247
Name should have been
a giveaway. I'll send him up.

176
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:36,486
Why are you so sure
I'm gonna do what you say?

177
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,923
Because you're a smart, old money
trust-fund girl who took this job

178
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,934
because your liberal ideology makes
you want to make a difference,

179
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:48,005
but you're already getting
bored, and this is interesting.

180
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,937
Why would you say any of that?

181
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:52,769
Your shoes.

182
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,681
A different, expensive pair
every day, but never leather.

183
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,680
Which means you're
both rich and liberal.

184
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,775
Antique locket that's unpolished
gold, not some hipster thing.

185
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,683
It's a family heirloom,
which means old money.

186
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,450
Osler scarf, only on Fridays,

187
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,685
which means you did
your residency at Hopkins.

188
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:13,287
Which means you're smarter than our
interactions would so far indicate.

189
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,194
And your eyes.

190
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,627
The only time you haven't looked bored in
the three months since you've been here

191
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,638
is when we've been
discussing this diagnosis.

192
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,975
<i>So, yeah, you'll
treat him for lupus.</i>

193
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,217
House.

194
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,315
He wants you.

195
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,498
Parole?

196
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,436
You didn't tell me.

197
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,406
I didn't want
a big emotional scene.

198
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,738
You know what the rules are.

199
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,011
On short time, tax goes up.

200
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,087
How many do you want?

201
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:13,680
All of them.

202
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,686
Come on, Mendelson.
I should be on six a day.

203
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,294
I get four and I give you two.

204
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,029
Fine.

205
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,530
I'll get one in my cell
after lights out,

206
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:31,871
plus Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday. That's 11 in all.

207
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,103
I count 20.

208
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,204
You knew on Monday, you get out Friday.
Five days.

209
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,611
Should have told me earlier.

210
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,717
They give out four a day, max.

211
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,790
You'll figure something out.

212
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,118
You're a creative guy.

213
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,783
What if I just go into
protective custody

214
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,554
and spend the next
three days in the hole?

215
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,730
You could PC up.

216
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,164
But then you'll get out.

217
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,736
And unlike you, I got
friends on the outside.

218
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,967
Porter.

219
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,909
Doc. What you need?

220
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,407
I'm running a special
on grilled cheese this week.

221
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:13,643
I got some new girly mags, too.

222
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,743
I was thinking of
something more Vicodinny.

223
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,182
At least 16, and I
need them Friday at noon.

224
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,650
Man' that's pricey,
but it can be done.

225
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,422
How about you have one of
your peeps on the outside

226
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,988
send $200 to my boy
up in Trenton?

227
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,589
I am peepless.

228
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,832
This is just you haggling, right?
No.

229
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:38,536
You ever seen me chatting on the phone?
Taking visitors?

230
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,835
All right. I'm gonna
have to clean you out.

231
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:44,676
I'm gonna need to see some tuna, I'm
gonna need to see some stamps, stereo...

232
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,374
Just give them to me
as soon as you can.

233
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,284
What happened?

234
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,527
I was trying to
use the phone, I just...

235
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,122
I just got jostled
a little, that's all.

236
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,202
Who hit you?

237
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,064
No. I just... I just
bumped into the wall.

238
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,405
It's not lupus.

239
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,339
Is that good?

240
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,581
Does it feel good?

241
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:53,510
Sick.

242
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,116
No, I'm just going
through a bit of withdrawal.

243
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,187
I'm trying to survive on one
a day for the next few days.

244
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,185
No.

245
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,265
Fix him.

246
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:26,406
It's not lupus.
He broke his arm.

247
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,782
Or it is lupus,
and he was in a fight.

248
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,114
He was in a jostle.

249
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,621
Because if he admits he was in a
fight, then he goes to the hole.

250
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,215
That's why he'd lie to the guards.
He's got no reason to lie to me.

251
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:37,550
Oh.

252
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,563
See'? There are
those eyes again.

253
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,561
How about a viral
syndrome or MRSA?

254
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,669
No, wouldn't chew up
the bone that fast.

255
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,069
But reaction to meds could.

256
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,501
- May I?
- May you what?

257
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,942
Make me lose my job by
showing you a patient file'?

258
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,579
But why don't you assume
no recent meds?

259
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,484
How long can I assume
that he's been smoking,

260
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:04,953
based on his yellow fingers?

261
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:07,855
You're thinking
lung cancer, metastatic.

262
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,793
I'll x-ray him on Friday.

263
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,763
We share a traveling x-ray
machine with two other clinics.

264
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,492
I'm out of here on Friday.
He's not.

265
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,035
Well, but if he throws
a clot and strokes out,

266
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,800
you can use the x-ray
to do the autopsy.

267
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,030
Start him on blood thinners.

268
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,371
Very interesting practice
you must have run.

269
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,378
No need for tests,
no need for proof?

270
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,774
Where are you going?
To the proof store.

271
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,051
You were right about Nicole.

272
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,483
About me not caring?
I thought so.

273
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,391
It wasn't her mom.
It's her.

274
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,999
She doesn't want to talk to me.

275
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:53,162
Please. I'm trying to listen to
your lungs, not your self-pity.

276
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,298
Cancer can wait.

277
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,069
Hey, you heading out to the yard?
Mmm-hmm.

278
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,668
Mind trying to
find me a cricket?

279
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,544
The old swap trick.

280
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,473
You don't think that'll piss
off your cellie even more

281
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,019
when he figures
it's a different bug?

282
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:12,056
I'll dress them the same,
like in Vertigo.

283
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:17,690
<i>I'll try. But they spray so much
pesticides, I'm surprised we're alive.</i>

284
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,865
Good point.

285
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,695
He?'

286
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,427
How's it coming?

287
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,561
It ain't.

288
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,504
Confederates be giving
themselves spanking new tats.

289
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,600
They putting a claim
on all my Vicodin.

290
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,109
Now I love you and all,
my brother,

291
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,546
but not as much as I love my gang
of crazy, roided out Nazi bitches.

292
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,416
Now try an inch to the left.

293
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:52,023
Hear the difference?
Yeah.

294
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,292
It's called
an acoustical shadow.

295
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,130
Means he's got a tumor.

296
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,895
How did you find that
without a stethoscope?

297
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,436
I didn't even know
you could do this.

298
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,436
Start the blood thinners.

299
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,438
So I for sure got lung cancer?

300
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,906
<i>No.
Yeah.</i>

301
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,143
All you've proven is there's
an anomaly in his chest.

302
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,236
Which means your initial
diagnosis could still be right?

303
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,145
Which, apparently,
really bugs you.

304
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:18,081
I could do a clotting test.

305
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,117
That's a good idea.

306
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:27,459
We're just gonna cut your earlobe
a bit and check back in two minutes.

307
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:30,762
If there's a little blood
bubbling up, that's normal.

308
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:35,731
But if it's completely clotted,
it may indicate cancer.

309
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,401
Okay? Ready?

310
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,921
Are you really
leaving medicine?

311
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,000
What are you gonna do?

312
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:13,676
You know, for someone who asks
as many favors as you do,

313
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:16,872
you sure don't make any effort
to win me over.

314
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:25,277
Before I went to med school, I thought
about getting a PhD in physics.

315
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,219
You ever heard of dark matter?

316
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,360
The way galaxies rotate,
the motion of the universe,

317
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:36,194
it means there's six times
more stuff than we can detect.

318
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:40,162
It's been theorized, but no
one's ever proved it exists.

319
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:42,638
So you'd want to research it?

320
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,366
Why? It's the greatest
mystery there is.

321
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,503
Theory of everything.

322
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,343
And completely divorced
from humanity.

323
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:55,245
Me and humanity,
we got together too young.

324
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,151
You have a gift.

325
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:04,183
There is something in this world
you are undeniably great at.

326
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:09,061
You can read people.
You understand them.

327
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:11,559
You gotta go back to medicine.

328
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,738
Well, if that gift is related
to what brought me here,

329
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:20,436
you'll understand why I'd wanna
check the returns policy.

330
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,240
Hey! Is this
supposed to happen?

331
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,180
Cool.

332
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,961
Jiminy didn't chirp
much last night.

333
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,771
If it's a disease,
he's six inches under.

334
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,601
But this could also
be pesticide poisoning,

335
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:58,610
which bicarbonate of soda
has been used to treat.

336
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,745
See'? Just so much,
and no more.

337
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:15,087
<i>Mmm.</i>

338
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,940
This is where
you say thank you.

339
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:30,745
Or I say thank you
for not killing me.

340
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,253
Thank you.

341
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,370
He?'

342
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:08,648
The x-ray didn't show any tumors. The
acoustical shadow was just a lipoma.

343
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,119
I'm thinking...
You all right?

344
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,456
I'm fine.

345
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,889
Ibuprofen?

346
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,357
It's not gonna help.

347
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,002
You can look at
the patient file if you want.

348
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,235
You trust me?

349
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:32,635
Any reason I shouldn't?

350
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:36,203
You're really not good at reading
people, are you? Or buildings.

351
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,014
People are complicated.

352
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,981
And people change.

353
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,679
Not that much to the first
and not at all to the second.

354
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:44,247
But if it'll get me the file...

355
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,380
If we add clotting disorder to the
symptoms, it's gotta be a toxin...

356
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,981
This guy's the only
one with symptoms.

357
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,023
It's either gotta be
his cell or his workstation.

358
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:54,690
The laundry. So maybe
a solvent or detergent?

359
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,757
Can you get me an escort
to gather samples?

360
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,501
Dr. Adams.

361
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,761
Why does this man have a file?

362
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:16,414
You need to get cotton swabs.

363
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,886
Not now. I got
something to do.

364
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,221
You're a prisoner on tier time.

365
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,021
By definition, you
have nothing to do.

366
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,959
I'm gonna call her family
her friends, her work.

367
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,290
I'm gonna get
through eventually.

368
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:27,921
You're moving slower,
you're getting weaker.

369
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,432
This thing is attacking your
bones, your joints, your blood.

370
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,900
Look' my girl's more important.

371
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,437
She's not your girl, you idiot!

372
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,266
She was the girlfriend
of a loser drug dealer.

373
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,938
You think she's got the self-control
to wait around for three years?

374
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,106
You think she should?

375
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:49,118
There's a reason we're locked
away from nice, normal people.

376
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,250
Your life outside is over.

377
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,819
Your friends, your girl,
everyone you worked with,

378
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,625
they've moved on.

379
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,633
Get out of my house.

380
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:09,736
Get out!

381
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,252
Where's Sykes?
Off at his other clinics.

382
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:26,655
Great. I'm gonna go
to the laundry.

383
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,622
Give me some swabs...
No.

384
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,354
What? He yelled at you
for letting me see the file.

385
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,629
You'll get over it.
Few years of therapy maybe...

386
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,825
Why did you lie to me
about what you were in for?

387
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:47,340
Okay, so I drove a car into a wall
instead of stealing some pills.

388
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,647
You obviously don't care what I
did, you care that I lied to you.

389
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,704
You feel jilted.
I feel stupid.

390
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:56,608
It doesn't even make sense.
Why are you doing time'?

391
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:59,889
You didn't have any priors.
You didn't hurt anyone.

392
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,459
I had a bad lawyer.

393
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:17,638
I'm sorry.

394
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,403
We can't talk about
this case any more.

395
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:48,828
We hear you're gonna need an incentive
to get all my pills by tomorrow.

396
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:52,568
I can't get all 20,
but once I get out...

397
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,337
Give us a minute.

398
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,415
Why do you think
I'm on buspirone?

399
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,954
<i>The stress.</i>

400
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,124
I get the runs
almost every day.

401
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,684
Any sign of weakness,
20 guys would line up

402
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:16,196
to stick a sharpened-up
toothbrush in my eye.

403
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:20,431
So as much as my better nature,
really, wants to give you a pass,

404
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,636
it just wouldn't be
good for my health.

405
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,537
See you tomorrow.

406
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,161
I need your help.

407
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:55,136
You got any matches?

408
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:58,140
No. That's serious
contraband.

409
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,073
What are you planning to do?

410
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,237
How about a stick of gum?

411
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,474
Sure.

412
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,144
I'm gonna need that, too.

413
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:14,079
Why?

414
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,923
Why do I need the pen

415
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,758
that you always carry around
and never write with?

416
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,259
This is plan B.

417
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,736
What happened to your cheek?

418
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,642
What is it?

419
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,042
A fire?

420
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:16,244
House, we gotta evacuate
this area. Come on.

421
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:23,887
Hey, House.

422
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:27,828
You were saying something about
how I should, like, swab or...

423
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,900
You're confusing me
with the clinic again.

424
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,165
What, you're abandoning me?

425
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:38,334
As soon as you leave, I am.

426
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,172
Why? What changed?

427
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:46,514
I'm just done. No you,
medicine, fixing people. Done.

428
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:49,247
Now, get out.

429
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,514
Your lips are swelling.

430
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,193
Open your mouth.

431
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,524
Did you just eat something?

432
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,428
Meatloaf, potatoes, coffee...

433
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:03,761
You allergic to anything?

434
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:06,631
Guard!

435
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:08,934
You're going into
anaphylactic shock.

436
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,267
Guard!

437
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:11,963
Damn it.

438
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,474
I gotta make a hole,
so you can breathe.

439
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:32,122
House, get away from him!

440
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:33,924
He's having an allergic reaction.
He can't breathe.

441
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,429
Lie on the ground with your
hands behind your head.

442
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:38,057
Alvarez, look at what I'm doing.
It's a tracheotomy.

443
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,726
Come on, man.
You know I'm a doctor.

444
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,007
What's wrong with him?

445
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,734
I have no idea.

446
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:41,353
Saving us both from
contraband charges.

447
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,861
It's been great knowing you.

448
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:54,293
I need to be taken into
protective custody.

449
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:12,751
Wow, that was great.

450
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,058
I think I really dodged
a bullet there.

451
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,058
You don't need PC?

452
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,591
Nothing personal.
We'll reschedule.

453
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,597
Rain check, I promise.

454
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:31,765
It wasn't the food.

455
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,569
It was the heat.

456
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:35,575
It's mastocytosis.

457
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:38,938
Could be set off by hot liquids,
like the coffee he just drank.

458
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,074
- Masto's usually a skin disease.
- "Usually"?

459
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:43,909
It can hit any organ.

460
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,784
Joint pain, osteopenia and
anaphylaxis, eyebrow loss.

461
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,681
It fits.

462
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:52,022
It's a possibility. I'll run
some blood tests. Thank you.

463
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:55,758
No. No! It's almost impossible to
confirm masto with blood work.

464
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:58,294
Just give him five aspirin.

465
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,961
If he has masto,

466
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:04,198
he'll go into anaphylactic shock and
won't be able to breathe again.

467
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,775
You do understand the meaning
of the word "confirm".

468
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:08,139
I'll do ii.

469
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,540
I almost died in that cell.

470
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,839
House, you're in here

471
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,383
because you think you can do whatever
you want, whenever you want.

472
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,884
You can't.
And neither can I.

473
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:20,184
The ACLU would have my job, my
license, maybe even my house

474
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,848
if I do an unauthorized,
experimental...

475
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,222
But if it is masto...
It's not.

476
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,158
Well, what do you have to lose
by giving him the aspirin?

477
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:27,524
I'm not taking the risk.

478
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:28,825
It's his risk to take.

479
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:31,532
If he has another attack and there
isn't a doctor in the next cell,

480
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:32,727
he could die.

481
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:35,998
For one second, will you stop
covering your ass and do the test?

482
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:38,497
I think House is right.

483
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,734
No.

484
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,973
<i>You're a moron and a coward.
I'll do it myself.</i>

485
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,980
Guard.

486
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:51,712
You're done here,

487
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,484
just like every other place you've
ever set foot in your life.

488
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,752
If I ever see you
in here again,

489
00:36:56,848 --> 00:37:00,261
I will write you up and they
will revoke your parole.

490
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,339
Dr. House.

491
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:17,677
Did you get all the
Vicodin you needed?

492
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:19,379
I'm not an idiot.

493
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:22,280
That fire, that bruise
on your face.

494
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:27,345
I talk to prisoners, I know about exit taxes.
You're clearly getting squeezed.

495
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,358
I need 20.

496
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,766
And let me back in the clinic
when Sykes is gone.

497
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:42,462
I'll take care of Nick. You
can't if you're not willing.

498
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,733
Just take care of yourself.

499
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,465
Well done.

500
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,558
I knew if you'd learned
nothing else in here,

501
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,902
you'd learned the smart thing
is to fall in line.

502
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,674
You're absolutely right.

503
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,318
Hey! Hey! Hey!

504
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,916
I need back-up here.

505
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:40,155
Hey! Hey!
Son of a bitch!

506
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:43,258
You gotta get past me before
solitary, you hear me?

507
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:47,259
Come on. Come on!

508
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,830
Thanks for getting me
to the clinic.

509
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:53,267
Take him out.

510
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:57,436
I got only two years
left in my stretch.

511
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,671
Take him out.

512
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,846
C.O.!
Need a little help here!

513
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:06,787
I need back-up! I need back-up! Without
back-up there will be a fight here.

514
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,719
Alvarez!

515
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:16,523
Sullivan, back off!

516
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:18,532
Mendelson, you'll be
held responsible!

517
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:21,627
Hey, I'm just
playing solitaire.

518
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,326
Hands behind your head.

519
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,990
On the ground!

520
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,567
You are so lucky.

521
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:01,837
We got a guy in an ambulance
heading to Princeton General.

522
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:04,504
Another dozen getting
ear gas hosed off them.

523
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,412
Hey, sit down!

524
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:08,172
Back off!

525
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:09,684
Sit down!

526
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,589
Where's the aspirin?

527
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:23,688
Oh, God. Did you get
beaten up on purpose?

528
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,860
House. What are you doing?

529
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,395
Hey!

530
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:31,571
House, open up.
This is a direct order.

531
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,539
Yeah, it's always
a direct order.

532
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,305
Eight months, and I haven't heard
an indirect order in here.

533
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:37,744
Dr. Adams!

534
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,072
They're gonna revoke
your parole.

535
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:44,949
They're gonna charge you with extra crimes.
You'll be here six more months, minimum.

536
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,215
Sorry, distracted.

537
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:47,746
You were saying?

538
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,756
I checked your file.
You didn't have a bad lawyer,

539
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,155
you had no lawyer.

540
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:55,095
You took the first deal they offered you
because you wanted to punish yourself.

541
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:56,656
You think getting beaten up,

542
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,995
you think saving this one guy
will wipe your slate clean?

543
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,160
No.

544
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:03,239
Then why are you doing this?
Because I have a gift.

545
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:08,236
Once you drink this, you should
get an attack almost immediately.

546
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,505
That is, if I am right.

547
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,602
You just bought yourself
months in solitary.

548
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:13,909
Was it really worth it?
If I'm wrong, no, it wasn't.

549
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:17,950
No! No! No! Get the cup!
Get the cup!

550
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,111
Drink it! Drink it!

551
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,916
No! Grab the cup!

552
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,255
Hands behind your back.

553
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:30,031
What were you thinking?
I don't know. I...

554
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:32,266
I was... I was scared.

555
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:41,972
No!

556
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,434
You're fired.

557
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:45,880
You're beyond fired.

558
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,782
You're completely un-hirable anywhere.
Do you understand that'?

559
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:54,988
Yes. Now shut up and let's
see if he has an attack.

560
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:16,302
Come on.
Just a little more time.

561
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,749
Get him out of here.
