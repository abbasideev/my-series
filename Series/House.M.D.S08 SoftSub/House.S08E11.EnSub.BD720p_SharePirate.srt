1
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,221
<i>Pressure.
I need pressure.</i>

2
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,389
<i>Give me sutures...</i>

3
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:21,656
<i>We need an Epi.</i>

4
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:22,996
Alert trauma.

5
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,685
Let the record show
that we are officially

6
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,883
convening
a disciplinary hearing

7
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:24,794
regarding the events on February
3rd, 2012, in patient room 209.

8
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,024
Dr. House, this recording will
be transcribed and published

9
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,126
along with all supporting
documentation and rulings.

10
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,568
Do you have any questions
before we get started?

11
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:35,732
Yeah.

12
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,299
Who the hell are you?

13
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,143
I'm Walter Cofield. Chief of
Neurology, Mercy Hospital.

14
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,910
I'll be deciding
your fate today.

15
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,727
Cofield.

16
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,595
You were the Residency Director at
Hopkins before you moved to Mercy.

17
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:04,098
Which means it's safe to assume
that you trained Foreman.

18
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,068
Which means it's also safe to
assume that he trusts you.

19
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,799
This hearing isn't
about me, Dr. House.

20
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,237
I know you'd like
to make it about me

21
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,902
because then it
wouldn't be about you.

22
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,412
It's interesting that he picked the
old mentor to judge the new one.

23
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,745
Interesting' but not relevant.

24
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,484
The facts of this case,

25
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,951
on the other hand... The
facts are in the file.

26
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,456
If you have trouble reading my
handwriting, give me a call.

27
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,788
I'm going back to work.

28
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:32,496
If I just consider the file, the
facts aren't in your favor.

29
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,698
The facts say
you should be suspended.

30
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,132
Which, from what I understand,

31
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,362
would mean a revocation
of your parole.

32
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,618
The patient was a 32-year-old
high school chemistry teacher.

33
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,060
<i>He collapsed while out jogging.</i>

34
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,994
<i>He was paralyzed in
all four extremities</i>

35
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,225
<i>despite the fact
that the scans...</i>

36
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,529
show no sign of stroke
or structural lesions.

37
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,365
Did you put out
an APB for a car

38
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,700
with a man-shaped
dent in the grill?

39
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,298
No broken bones,
no signs of trauma.

40
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,810
Transverse myelitis.
Boring.

41
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,474
No enhancement on the MRI.

42
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,810
I just don't know what to do.

43
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,215
Please, you have to
help me solve this thing.

44
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,321
A little poetic license.

45
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,724
What are you doing?

46
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,029
Taking my vic-amins.

47
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,395
Those are Vicodin?

48
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,833
Did you have surgery recently?

49
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,529
About a decade ago.

50
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:49,205
My leg is no good
at judging time.

51
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,900
Were you taking Vicodin
during this case?

52
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,375
Uh...

53
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,738
Yes.

54
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:01,212
And during about nine
years' previous cases.

55
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,420
My process is proven.

56
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:09,723
Good things usually happen.
Bad things sometimes happen.

57
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:14,725
And when bad things happen, we
should figure out what went wrong

58
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,961
so we can learn from it
and correct it.

59
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,764
So we can assign blame.

60
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,807
Instead of recognizing that
bad things sometimes happen.

61
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,875
It was nobody's fault.

62
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,783
And then what happened?

63
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,946
Those who can, do.
Those who can't, teach.

64
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,548
Those who can't teach,
teach gym.

65
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:46,128
And those who can't move their arms
or legs teach us to laugh at others.

66
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,994
House actually presented
the case in that way?

67
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,591
Or are you just trying
to make him look bad?

68
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,068
Why would I be trying
to make him look bad?

69
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,800
Could be your
not-so-subtle way

70
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,001
of implying
this was House's fault.

71
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,303
Given what's happened,
it's understandable

72
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,107
that your opinion would
color your testimony.

73
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,272
But I just want to know
what you said, what you did

74
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,681
and what you were
thinking at the time.

75
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,988
I don't think it was his fault.

76
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,149
Just tell me
your initial theory.

77
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,759
I thought the patient
had a liver problem.

78
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,094
Hepatic encephalopathy
explained why he passed out,

79
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,962
why he couldn't move his limbs.

80
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,700
But that's not the idea
House went with?

81
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,628
He thought Taub's idea
was stupid.

82
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,439
And what about your idea?

83
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,169
He thought that
was stupid, too.

84
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,436
No. I meant,
what was it?

85
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:38,378
Oh. I thought the patient had
normal pressure hydrocephalus.

86
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,610
And why did House think
that was stupid?

87
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,278
Oh, come on.

88
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,816
Unless you're an idiot, you know
why I thought Park was an idiot.

89
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,618
The patient had low opening
pressure on his LP.

90
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,853
That's what I said.

91
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,554
No, you idiot.

92
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,327
The patient had low opening
pressure on his LP.

93
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,570
Try unsquinting your eyes and
reading the labs next time.

94
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,071
Are you intentionally trying
to get me to dislike you?

95
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,039
That wasn't me.
The chair squeaked.

96
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,666
You're testifying
for the record

97
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,872
that you actually used the
phrasing, "unsquint your eyes"?

98
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,480
This is not the place to
exorcise your guilt,

99
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,675
I just want to know exactly...

100
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:17,188
I actually used the phrasing
"unsquint your eyes."

101
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,390
He's hypokalemic,

102
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:22,926
could indicate a problem with
his heart, which would...

103
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,188
EKG was normal.

104
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:25,423
But, Chase,

105
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,895
a doctor who
actually takes the time

106
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,263
to read the lab reports,
has a point.

107
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,766
The guy's potassium is off.

108
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,700
Could be thyrotoxic paralysis.

109
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,899
Stan him on steroids, PTU,
and beta blockers.

110
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,004
Mmm-hmm.

111
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:43,005
And how did these orange smudges
get on the patient file?

112
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,051
Seriously?
That's your follow up?

113
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,848
I eat a lot of Cheetos,
I forget to wash my hands.

114
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,552
Is my snacking really
relevant to this case?

115
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:58,527
Might be, if these were
actually Cheetos stains.

116
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,723
What are they?

117
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,873
Seriously, House?

118
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,599
You're blaming me?

119
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,735
You used Adams' shampoo.

120
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,638
I didn't do ii.

121
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,048
<i>It was a harmless prank.</i>

122
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,120
My team is made up of
Type A personalities.

123
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,157
They need somebody to break the
tension every once in a while.

124
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,920
So this was a team
building exercise?

125
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,792
Is that what he called it?

126
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,227
It's what he implied.

127
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,959
House prefers
chaos over cohesion.

128
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:39,231
He believes that disagreement and
mistrust lead to better ideas.

129
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,567
He's not wrong.

130
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,671
As opposed to being right?

131
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,734
So you treated with steroids.

132
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,610
And then what happened?
They worked.

133
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:50,977
<i>Our patient woke up.</i>

134
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,345
Bill?

135
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:54,650
Can you hear me?

136
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,015
Yeah.

137
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,250
I'm thirsty.

138
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,292
That's normal. You've been
in a coma for several hours.

139
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,157
Can you tell me your name?

140
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,354
Bill. Bill Koppelman.

141
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,822
Can you tell me
what happened to me?

142
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,423
We're treating you for
an overactive thyroid.

143
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,435
We think that's why you
passed out and couldn't move.

144
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,164
Can you wiggle
your fingers for me?

145
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,603
Is he going to be okay?

146
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,337
Excuse me, but only family
members are allowed.

147
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,814
It's okay.
They're my students.

148
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,508
Everyone back at school
is so worried about you.

149
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,483
Is he sick because
of the explosion?

150
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,349
What explosion?
What explosion?

151
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,450
What explosion?

152
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,321
A chemistry demonstration he was
doing for his class went wrong.

153
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,987
Then why was it not already
in the patient history'?

154
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,962
Because the patient
was unconscious.

155
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,029
But I'm assuming Dr. House
spoke to the wife.

156
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,899
The wife didn't know
about the explosion.

157
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,805
And I was the one
who questioned her.

158
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,966
So if there was an
oversight, it was mine.

159
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,642
Does Dr. House not attach
importance to patient histories?

160
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,648
No. He thinks
they're crucial.

161
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:01,879
He just doesn't think being in the
same room as the patient is crucial.

162
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,251
House thinks avoiding patients

163
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,723
allows him to stay as
objective as possible.

164
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,657
He's not wrong.

165
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,833
That sounds like a very diplomatic
way of saying he's lazy.

166
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,696
That's also true.

167
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,532
Either way, I'm covered.

168
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,071
If you want an accurate
patient history,

169
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,834
don't ever talk to the patient.

170
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,500
Everybody lies.

171
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,739
Except me.

172
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,177
To you.

173
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,407
Would never do that.

174
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,607
Okay. Say you're right.

175
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:36,777
If you had actually been in the
room questioning the patient,

176
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,446
you could read body language,

177
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,957
you could ask
follow up questions,

178
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,426
and warn him of the
cost of lying to you.

179
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,622
Don't forget thumbscrews.

180
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,792
Can you dispute the possibility

181
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,234
that had you visited the patient
sooner, maybe talked to the wife,

182
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,903
been directed to
one of the students,

183
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,965
that this case might have
ended very differently?

184
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,073
<i>It wasn't exactly an explosion.</i>

185
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:07,476
It was a controlled reaction
that went a little haywire.

186
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,281
It was, too, an explosion.

187
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,915
Simon Harris filmed the whole
thing on his camera phone

188
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,321
and posted it on YouTube.

189
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,916
It got, like,
over 75,000 hits already.

190
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,224
Looks like you've
gone viral, hon.

191
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:26,292
He had a loss of consciousness,
temporary paralysis,

192
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,066
but when I was told that the
patient coughed up blood,

193
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,303
things really started
to get interesting.

194
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:39,616
Your patient was doubled over
in pain and coughing up blood.

195
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,447
And you found that interesting?

196
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,485
Why, is that bad?

197
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,987
It's interesting.

198
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,190
I do this demonstration
every year.

199
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,770
But I usually have a student
aide help me set it up.

200
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:03,874
Apparently this year he added
extra hydrofluoric acid,

201
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,169
which is why it exploded.

202
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,871
The student aide was just
trying to make a viral video,

203
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,810
not hurt anyone.

204
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,712
Ended up doing both.

205
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,178
So we figured the patient
inhaled the extra large dose

206
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,617
of hydrofluoric acid, and...

207
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,120
burned his lungs, which
is why he coughed up blood.

208
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,953
If only burnt lungs explained
the passing out and paralysis.

209
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,187
The explosion does.
Check out the video again.

210
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,887
He smacked his head
against the wall.

211
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,123
If that caused swelling
in his brainstem

212
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,657
that would have led to the eventual
loss of consciousness and paralysis.

213
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,463
So we discussed it
a little longer

214
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,871
and House decided to
treat with heparin.

215
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,705
I wouldn't mind
a couple more details.

216
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,681
It was aerosolized heparin.

217
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,218
You skipped over
the actual DDX,

218
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,811
and now you're
averting your eyes.

219
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,654
I'm growing more and more
curious by the moment.

220
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,658
He smacked his head
against the wall.

221
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,926
If that caused swelling
in his brainstem

222
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,230
that would have led to the eventual
loss of consciousness and paralysis.

223
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,894
Nobody move.
Ugh!

224
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,370
He had on a what?

225
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:10,772
Gas mask.

226
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,713
The stink bomb was Chase's.

227
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,445
He was getting revenge
for the orange hair

228
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,454
and rigged it
in House's office.

229
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,690
But House found it.

230
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,755
Mmm-hmm.

231
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,398
You can leave when
I have an answer.

232
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,127
Might help if
we knew the question.

233
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:40,432
How do we treat chemical
burns inside the lungs?

234
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:44,235
Maybe we can use a bronchoalveolar
lavage to wash them outwith water.

235
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,709
Sorry, my fault,
I should have clarified.

236
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,904
How do we treat chemical
burns inside the lungs

237
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,538
without killing the patient?

238
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,584
Silver sulfadiazine works
well on chemical burns.

239
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,745
Burn cream would drown
him faster than water.

240
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,883
Well?

241
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,719
Aerosolized heparin.

242
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,753
Me like?

243
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,295
But that's only experimental,

244
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,921
it's never actually
been used before.

245
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,090
Not true.

246
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:09,728
It's been used in sheep.

247
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,097
Uh-huh.

248
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,596
The guy was
going downhill fast.

249
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:20,133
We needed a treatment
that was a slope changer.

250
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,235
So you busted out the
sulphur dioxide stink bomb?

251
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,307
It was a team
building exercise.

252
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,509
No, it was manipulation.

253
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:29,177
You were pressuring your team into
coming up with unsafe medical ideas

254
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,618
just to get out of that room.

255
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,757
You say pressure,
I say inspire.

256
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:38,921
The usual, safe ideas were not going to work.
Aerosolized heparin might.

257
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,987
And everyone else just
went along with this?

258
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:46,297
No. I told House I thought
it was a mistake.

259
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,838
And those were
your exact words?

260
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,298
I think I might
have said "insane."

261
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,776
You thought it was insane
and yet you let it happen.

262
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,868
No, I...

263
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,878
If you disagree with Dr. House
on patient safety, Doctor,

264
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,277
it is your duty to speak up.

265
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,544
Otherwise,
you're equally lo blame.

266
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,879
I did speak up.
I tried.

267
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,714
And you failed.

268
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,223
And that's why I went
to Dr. Foreman.

269
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,687
The heparin could
cause the patient

270
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,231
to bleed into his lungs
even faster.

271
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,527
It is crazy.

272
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,364
But House doesn't do crazy
just for crazy's sake.

273
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,834
If he thinks this is the only
way to help the patient...

274
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,347
You did not tell me
you were involved in this case

275
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,710
when you asked me to do this.

276
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,714
I wasn't.

277
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:37,054
The heparin decision didn't have
anything to do with the outcome.

278
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:41,224
If signing off on everything
House does is a pattern,

279
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,724
it affects
the way House behaves,

280
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,092
it affects the way House's team
reacts to the way House behaves.

281
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,526
House

282
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,593
is brilliant.

283
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,361
I give him the benefit of
the doubt most of the time,

284
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,238
because I've seen
what he can do.

285
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,501
Getting House out of prison

286
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,568
is the biggest decision you've
made as Dean of Medicine, right?

287
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,011
And if he's suspended as a
result of this hearing,

288
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,949
he violates his parole
and he goes back.

289
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,355
And that probably leaves you
as former Dean of Medicine.

290
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,447
I suppose so.

291
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,117
You didn't choose me
to oversee this

292
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,219
because you thought
I could be objective,

293
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,130
you chose me because you
thought I'd have your back.

294
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:27,227
And I'd think twice about making a
decision that would get you fired.

295
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,369
Eric,

296
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,570
I'm sorry.

297
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,444
But if your
get-House-out-of-jail-free

298
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:39,210
experiment blows up
in your face,

299
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,281
it's not my job to
get you out of it.

300
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,728
After you'd
administered the heparin,

301
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,458
I see there was a discharge
order in the chart.

302
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,158
Yet the patient never left.

303
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,167
House ordered
a therapeutic bath first,

304
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,569
to wash off any residual
chemicals from the blast

305
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,599
but we wound up
finding something.

306
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,974
You have a bit of a rash.

307
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,739
Can you raise both your arms?

308
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,441
We just need to
see how far it goes.

309
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,282
You told me
I was gonna be okay.

310
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,451
And now there's still
something wrong with me.

311
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,957
It probably doesn't mean anything,
but we want to make sure.

312
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,125
Of course you do.

313
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,458
I gotta get out
of here. Okay?

314
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,828
Just relax.

315
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,127
Please just let me
get out of here.

316
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,167
It'll just take a minute.

317
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,531
We need to get a good
look at the rash.

318
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:38,006
The rash? That was nothing. Just some
irritation from lying in bed all day.

319
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:41,605
The problem was
the patient's brain.

320
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:42,941
He freaked out.

321
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:44,881
I gotta get out of here.

322
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,847
I gotta get out of here! Easy.

323
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,475
<i>"Freak out" is a little strong.</i>

324
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,950
In my opinion at the time, it was the
rash that was going to kill him.

325
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,150
Invasive strep.

326
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,318
Reasonable theory,
supported by the evidence.

327
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,953
The evidence pointed
to psychosis.

328
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:02,064
We caused it by giving him
steroids when he first came in.

329
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,028
What'd you think?

330
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,033
I thought Park and Adams
were both right.

331
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,366
But that their conclusions
were both wrong.

332
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,337
The neuro symptoms and the rash

333
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,808
were both signs of
an underlying disease.

334
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:16,410
Together with the lung,
it added up to Wegener's.

335
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:22,581
How does Dr. House handle it
when three smart doctors

336
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,212
come up with three different,
but equally valid ideas?

337
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,154
I run a diagnostic trial.

338
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,562
Start the patient
on high dose steroids.

339
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,101
Multiple birds, single stone.

340
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,832
If Taub is right, then he
can walk out of here cured.

341
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,397
If Adams is right, he will spike
a fever, get hypotensive,

342
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:47,239
we can treat it and he can
walk out of here cured.

343
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,612
If Park is right and he goes
all Cuckoo's Nest on us,

344
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,273
<i>we can cross
"brain" off the list...</i>

345
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,510
diagnose him, and he can
walk out of here cured.

346
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,244
Are you trying to
make this easy for me?

347
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,886
By your own admission, if you
give the patient steroids,

348
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,116
two of the three outcomes
could make him worse.

349
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,750
What's making the patient worse
was not having a diagnosis.

350
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,851
This was the fastest way
to get it.

351
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,229
It was the perfect
diagnostic moment.

352
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:10,933
In light of what happened,

353
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,232
do you still think it was the
perfect diagnostic moment?

354
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,234
Yes.

355
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,740
My theory accounted for
all the medical outcomes.

356
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,545
It did not account for the
disobedience of my own team.

357
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,283
What are you doing?

358
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,418
I think you're right
about the strep.

359
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,427
Can't hurt to biopsy the
rash while we're waiting.

360
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,425
Thanks.

361
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,402
At the time, it seemed
like a good idea.

362
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,570
I know this is hard.

363
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,972
But please tell me
exactly what happened next.

364
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,744
Draw up a little anesthetic.

365
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,286
Two cc's Lidocaine.

366
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,088
Get away from me!

367
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,600
Bill, you're in a hospital.
Calm down!

368
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,839
Code Grey!

369
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,437
So your position is that your
team's disobedience caused this?

370
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,676
That's not what I said.

371
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,342
You said you didn't
anticipate their defiance.

372
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,147
You implied that all would
have been fine otherwise.

373
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,016
So who do you blame?

374
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,348
Dr. Adams or Dr. Chase?

375
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:42,790
Or both?

376
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,791
I don't blame either one.

377
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,800
So who do you blame,
Dr. House?

378
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,342
Code Grey!

379
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,877
Get Haloperidol.

380
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,473
Got ii.

381
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,196
Oh, my God, Chase!

382
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,351
Prep the OR! Get a gurney.
Start an IV!

383
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,353
Come on.

384
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,189
Bleeder's gotta be in here.

385
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,560
Got it!
Which artery?

386
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,263
It's his heart.

387
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,299
Fortunately, only the knife tip
reached the cardiac muscle.

388
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,900
Made a laceration
in the left ventricle

389
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,038
about the size of
the tip of my index finger.

390
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,906
At that moment,
he could only stay alive

391
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:15,418
as long as my finger
plugged the hole.

392
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,309
Hmm.

393
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:18,888
It could've been me
on the floor.

394
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,787
It should have been me.

395
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,950
It was my theory.

396
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:25,893
I held the needle in front of the
patient that set off his paranoia.

397
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,961
If you're looking
for someone to blame,

398
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:31,626
blame me.

399
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:36,767
Please continue.

400
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,834
Getting some ectopy.

401
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,602
Coming through! CHI:
Good carotid pulse.

402
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:41,905
- Regular?
- No.

403
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:43,679
Got a PVC.

404
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,908
Gotta move it, people.

405
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,652
My diagnostic test worked.

406
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:53,189
It proved that the patient had
a steroid induced psychosis.

407
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,587
That's what you took away
from this situation?

408
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,991
The brain was not a symptom
of an underlying disease.

409
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,755
Your colleague was stabbed.

410
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,594
Are you telling me
you didn't care'?

411
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,325
How bad is it?

412
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:07,369
Bad.

413
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,802
Patch.

414
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,601
Ready.

415
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:13,700
I can't take my finger out
he'll bleed.

416
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,142
I don't think he can take it.

417
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,507
Oxygenation's 100 percent.

418
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:17,808
He's as ready as he's gonna be.

419
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,439
We gotta go for it.

420
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,482
On my count.

421
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,613
One, two,

422
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,618
three.

423
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:30,653
Suture.

424
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:33,986
Got it.

425
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,120
BP is stable.

426
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,195
Patch is holding.

427
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,836
What was his heart rate?

428
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,165
He doesn't have one.
He's on bypass.

429
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,208
Not Chase, the patient.

430
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,305
You're DDX'ing?

431
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,980
Park, come with me.
Taub's got this.

432
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,245
My friend is here because
you didn't listen to me.

433
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,823
I did listen to you.
Chase didn't listen to me.

434
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,891
At this point, being here
makes you feel better,

435
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:05,189
you're not helping
Chase or our patient.

436
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,024
Fine.

437
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,389
So he just walked out?

438
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:11,559
There really was
nothing for him to do.

439
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:12,727
It speaks to
a certain callousness

440
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,498
on Dr. House's part
don't you think?

441
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,072
Who cares if House was callous?

442
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,107
Are you going to
punish callousness?

443
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:21,110
But you agree that empathy is a
useful quality for doctors'?

444
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,270
House is not the problem.

445
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,507
Your friend got stabbed.

446
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,447
He may die from those wounds.

447
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,609
If you had been in that room,
maybe that could have been you.

448
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,015
I wouldn't have
been in the room.

449
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,048
Implicitly, you just said
that Chase was at fault.

450
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,297
We all knew a psychotic episode

451
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,458
was one of the three
possible outcomes.

452
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,459
And Chase brought
a scalpel in there.

453
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,805
He endangered Dr. Adams,
he endangered himself,

454
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,874
and he endangered the patient.

455
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,909
Thank you.

456
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,765
Lungs, rash, and now
excessive RR variability.

457
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,035
Go.

458
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:10,811
It's a hospital. There are lots of
doctors that can take care of him.

459
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,785
And your thinking is
that only you guys

460
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,485
are qualified to sit in
this room, doing nothing?

461
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,358
If you're motivated by caring,

462
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,622
just bear in mind he's a
dedicated chemistry teacher

463
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:23,131
with a pretty wife and adoring
students and a baby on the way.

464
00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:24,565
She's not pregnant.

465
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,000
Would it make a difference?
Because I could knock her up.

466
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,028
Autonomic dysregulation...

467
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:30,630
Shut up.

468
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,668
Can you guys keep it down?

469
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,579
You made it, bud.

470
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,650
You're in the PACU.

471
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:47,181
You've been in surgery. The
anesthesia's just wearing off.

472
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,815
Did I have an epidural?

473
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,822
No.

474
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:56,924
Because I can't feel my legs.

475
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,445
Dr. Chase?

476
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:14,408
Robert?

477
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,541
Yeah.

478
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,354
I'm Walter Cofield.

479
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:23,519
I'm a neurologist over at...

480
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,721
I know who you are.

481
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:28,793
Good.

482
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:36,372
You think you're up for answering
a couple of questions?

483
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:40,241
Well, it's not like I can
get up and run away.

484
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,245
Wasn't my best joke.

485
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:52,647
I'm smiling because
for the last 12 hours

486
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,918
I've been picturing you
with orange hair.

487
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,886
I dyed it back.

488
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,903
Were you angry
with Dr. House?

489
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,746
It was a prank,
it wasn't uncommon.

490
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:17,973
So I've heard.

491
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,072
That doesn't mean
you couldn't get angry.

492
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:21,850
Might actually contribute
to that reaction.

493
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,284
Can I ask why that matters?

494
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:28,156
Are you trying to prove
that I was distracted,

495
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:30,454
that my judgment
was compromised?

496
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,657
Who do you think was at fault

497
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,163
for what happened
to you, Dr. Chase?

498
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:38,531
Again, why does it matter?

499
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,830
You're a smart doctor.

500
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:41,927
You know what happened here
better than anyone

501
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,507
and you've worked with
Dr. House longer than anyone.

502
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,974
And I suspect that you've spent

503
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,809
every minute since
this has happened

504
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,939
trying to answer
that very question.

505
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:56,946
I don't think it
was anyone's fault.

506
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:01,185
I was angry
but I wasn't distracted.

507
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:06,020
And I think if there's any
chance I'm gonna walk again

508
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,689
it's because
Dr. House is a genius.

509
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,294
What about warmth? Can you
feel the sheets on your skin?

510
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:14,962
I just said
I don't feel anything.

511
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,135
Objectivity, House.

512
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:26,708
What about
posttraumatic syringomyelia?

513
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,308
A syrinx formed in
the subarachnoid space,

514
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,819
blocking the flow of
cerebrospinal fluid.

515
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,220
That'd mean
the damage was permanent.

516
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,550
No.

517
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,653
Forget the nerves.

518
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,730
House, if ifs total
paralysis he must have...

519
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,059
Not necessarily.

520
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:43,326
Think arteries.

521
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,559
Blood flow to his spinal
column is cut off.

522
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,034
It's a clot in
the radicular artery.

523
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,162
That could be fixable.

524
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:51,002
Prep a room for an embolectomy

525
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,064
and let's get
that thing out of there

526
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:53,336
before it does any more damage.

527
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,570
And if it's not a clot?

528
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:58,512
Then you can ask Foreman if hospital
insurance covers ramp-vans.

529
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,847
You're through the aorta.

530
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:04,415
There.

531
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,854
Sensory level is at L5, it
must be the descending branch.

532
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,256
Can I see the monitor?

533
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,854
Stop there.
Shoot the dye.

534
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,099
There it is. TAUB:
Don't get too excited.

535
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,603
We still gotta get it out, still
could have done permanent damage.

536
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:28,606
Patient does not have
autonomic dysregulation.

537
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,611
There's blood in his urine bag.
Kidneys are failing.

538
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,443
House, not now.
Gotta be now.

539
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,777
Foreman's transferring our
guy to Princeton General

540
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,113
as soon as
there's a bed available.

541
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:40,054
Says the doctors here can no longer
be objective since the stabbing.

542
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:45,662
In the middle of a procedure that
could basically save your life,

543
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:49,128
House is actually trying
to drag people away?

544
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,298
How do you work
with a guy like that?

545
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,893
He wasn't trying to
pull anybody away.

546
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,233
Everyone had already refused
to work on that case.

547
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,399
He knew the answer.

548
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:02,809
He wanted to check on me.
But he needed an excuse.

549
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:06,515
Otherwise he could
be accused of caring.

550
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,850
So your testimony is that

551
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,680
Dr. House's
complete lack of concern

552
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,850
is evidence of
his deep concern?

553
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,033
Did you just do that?

554
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,197
What?

555
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:36,007
Wiggle your toes.

556
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,956
Do you feel that?

557
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:53,957
Congratulations.

558
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:55,959
It was the clot.

559
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,623
Short occlusion time
of the artery,

560
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,030
when the swelling goes down,

561
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,970
you should gain back at
least some of the function.

562
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,547
One more thing. Sorry.

563
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:18,148
You knew that your patient was
at risk for a psychotic break

564
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:21,554
when you brought a scalpel
within his reach.

565
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,557
Why did you ignore that risk?

566
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,593
I thought I was right
about the rash.

567
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,165
I would do it again.

568
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,905
I thought so.

569
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,237
That's it?
"I thought so"?

570
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,679
What the hell does that mean?

571
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,083
You brazenly defied your boss.

572
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:55,089
Now that happened
either because Dr. House

573
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,854
has established that
that's okay in his world.

574
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,860
Or his prank war
distracted you.

575
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,627
Or House makes medicine a game

576
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,361
and you just wanted
to beat him.

577
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,264
Whatever the reason,

578
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,274
it boils down to the fact
that you may never walk again

579
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:17,313
because House created an atmosphere
that promotes recklessness.

580
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:42,571
This will be our last
round of questions.

581
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:47,304
I've spoken
with Dr. Chase.

582
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,242
You know he regained movement?

583
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,840
No.

584
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,323
Are you really this indifferent

585
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:09,365
to the fact that
Dr. Chase is hurt?

586
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,625
Are we going off the record
because this is irrelevant

587
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,261
or are you going to hit me?

588
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,504
Why don't you go tell
the guy you're sorry...

589
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,006
I didn't do anything wrong.

590
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,200
It's not an admission of guilt.

591
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,174
He's your friend
and he's not well.

592
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:22,336
He's a co-worker.

593
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:26,610
Co-worker whom you've known for
almost 10 years who nearly died.

594
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:29,276
And who's still scared
he may not walk.

595
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:33,555
Are you going to have me
fired for bad manners?

596
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,528
I'm just trying
to understand you.

597
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:43,793
Why a man in your position,
with your abilities,

598
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,461
is incapable of shaking the
impulse to act like an ass.

599
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:49,539
Could we go back on the record
and get this over with?

600
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,411
Put the Vicodin away,
Dr. House.

601
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,704
My leg hurts.

602
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,986
Is that supposed to be funny?

603
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,559
Two explosions.

604
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,935
We're not done here.

605
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:35,274
Hey! Hold on!

606
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,679
Close it up.

607
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,910
Take him out of there.

608
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,853
Dr. Foreman said
you'd try this.

609
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:43,515
Said to tell you he's
no longer your patient.

610
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,289
Hey!

611
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,267
Wait.

612
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,037
Wait.

613
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,109
I have to get to my car.
I want to be...

614
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,944
Your husband has a tumor
in his lymph nodes.

615
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,944
You've been wrong every time.

616
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,110
Not this time.

617
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,881
<i>The explosion in the classroom</i>

618
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,219
<i>caused the cancer cells
to break open.</i>

619
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,985
<i>It's called
tumor Iysis syndrome.</i>

620
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:19,392
<i>His body was flooded with an excess
of phosphates, potassium, acids,</i>

621
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,327
<i>all kinds of cancerous junk.</i>

622
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:24,127
<i>That explains the paralysis, the
bleeding, the heart and kidney issues.</i>

623
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,667
Everything.

624
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,604
What about the psychotic break?

625
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,902
Turns out we caused that

626
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,746
This is treatable.
Okay?

627
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:44,419
You have to tell the new doctors
he needs total body radiation

628
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:45,613
and plasmapheresis.

629
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,417
Move your cane, please.

630
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,966
Where's Cofield?

631
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:04,598
He said you walked out.

632
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:06,869
I'm walking back.
I'm not done testifying.

633
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:10,640
Apparently you were. Said he'd
have his decision tomorrow.

634
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,954
This case is a fiasco.

635
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,885
I didn't sleep last night.

636
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:12,262
Dr. House is
obviously brilliant.

637
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,960
Well, I think
we've heard enough.

638
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,971
But Dr. House is
also a fiasco.

639
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,074
If I were to exonerate him,

640
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:24,437
condone his completely reckless,
immature, almost misanthropic behavior,

641
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:25,946
I would essentially
be sending a message

642
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:27,506
to all the other doctors
in this hospital

643
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,676
that it's okay to act that way, and...

644
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:30,941
Sorry.

645
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,615
- We're in the middle of something.
- I know.

646
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,314
I came to speak
with Dr. House,

647
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:37,086
and when they told me
he was in here

648
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:40,453
I thought
I should say something.

649
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,762
I mean,

650
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,598
he wasn't the nicest
doctor I've ever met.

651
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:47,830
Well, I think
we've heard enough.

652
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,304
But he was right.

653
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,606
They found the tumor.

654
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:57,209
They are removing it, and they
are starting plasmapheresis.

655
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:59,111
They expect a full recovery.

656
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,950
He saved my husbands life.

657
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:09,785
Well, I guess that's it.

658
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,051
Thanks again.

659
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:27,471
As I was saying,

660
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:31,876
Dr. House's process is
dangerous and inappropriate.

661
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:37,885
But he is effective.

662
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:43,557
I've decided that I would be
doing this hospital a disservice

663
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:47,687
if I did anything to
change that process.

664
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,556
Congratulations,
Dr. House.

665
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:56,036
This unfortunate stabbing incident
is officially nobody's fault.

666
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,022
Coward.

667
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:20,856
Excuse me?

668
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,898
You've got like
20 pages of notes there.

669
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:25,796
You were expecting to bore us
for at least half an hour.

670
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,130
You've got
my parole form in here.

671
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,799
You were going to
send me back to prison.

672
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,069
House, stop.

673
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:37,805
Good things usually happen,
bad things sometimes happen.

674
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:39,605
The fact that
that would-be widow

675
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:42,377
came in just in time to sob all
over your soft, mushy heart,

676
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,420
and the fact that her
husband is going to live,

677
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:47,112
does not change whether or
not I did the right thing.

678
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:24,449
How'd you get the firing
wire into the Vicodin bottle

679
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,426
without me noticing?

680
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,296
Why'd I even have to?

681
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:32,658
What was the point
of the orange hair?

682
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:36,032
Your hair smelled like Adams'.

683
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:39,002
Since there's no way you're
doing her without me knowing,

684
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:40,872
it means you were
just doing her shampoo.

685
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:44,137
Which means you were out late
drinking with some new girl

686
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:46,648
or because there is
no new girl.

687
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:48,842
You were trying to make up time
by showering at the hospital,

688
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,477
but you were too lazy
to buy your own shampoo.

689
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,384
So I found a way to let
you know to not be late.

690
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,491
You couldn't just ask me
to stop being late?

691
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,549
What fun would that be?

692
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,891
None of this is fun, House.

693
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:16,737
They decided that
your being stabbed

694
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,349
was nobody's fault.

695
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:32,885
They're wrong.

696
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,230
I'm sorry.

697
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,196
Anything else?

698
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,705
I'm kind of busy.

699
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,208
No. That was it.

700
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:01,857
I've got it.
