1
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,317
You're bleeding
through your bandage.

2
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,622
Good morning.

3
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,398
Don't we need to
get you to a doctor?

4
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:25,163
I am a doctor. That didn't
come up last night?

5
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,328
We didn't do a lot of talking.

6
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,989
I'm good.

7
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,497
You never told me
what caused your accident.

8
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,367
I was stabbed by a patient.

9
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,343
That'll teach me to overbill.

10
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,809
If she likes crippled guys, I'm
free for the next six minutes.

11
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,075
What do you want?

12
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,748
Forty-five
year-old truck driver.

13
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,114
Recurrent seizures,
no metabolic or structural...

14
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,552
Does this look
like a good time?

15
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,717
Sort of. At least
as good as the other

16
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,225
12 times that I've
called and paged you

17
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,386
in the last three weeks.

18
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,758
Those times,
I just didn't feel like

19
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,388
talking to you.
Kinda like now.

20
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,725
I'd apologize again,
but I'm still waiting

21
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,927
for you to accept
the first one.

22
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,971
You do work for me. I am entitled
to ask when you're coming back.

23
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,438
I don't know when
I'm coming back.

24
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:10,940
I don't know if
I'm coming back.

25
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,442
Got a problem with that'?
Fire me.

26
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,655
It's good to see
you in the hospital.

27
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,358
As a patient,
if not as a doctor.

28
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:13,962
Believe me, I'd rather be
the guy with the clipboard.

29
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,301
How you doing?

30
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,743
Arrhythmias are gone, fine
motor control's improving.

31
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,144
Not what I meant.

32
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,916
If you need to talk to
someone, a professional...

33
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,148
I'm fine.

34
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,687
Fine enough to
get back to work?

35
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,391
You don't have
to work for House,

36
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,329
but you do owe me
20 clinic hours.

37
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,332
What'? Getting knifed
doesn't buy me an extension?

38
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:48,167
Buys you whatever you need.
But I know you.

39
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,070
If all you do is
physical therapy,

40
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,040
and your
nighttime version of it,

41
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:56,204
you'll lose your mind faster than
you regain those fine motor skills.

42
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:12,930
I have this terrible pain in my left shoulder.
It came out of nowhere.

43
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,192
And nothing seems to help.

44
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:23,707
Any other symptoms? Chest pain?
Light-headedness?

45
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,640
No, none at all.

46
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,234
What were you doing
when the pain came on?

47
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,374
Just sitting and praying.

48
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,039
She'd been helping to
make the altar breads

49
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,947
that morning,
but no hard physical work,

50
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,746
or repetitive motion.

51
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,582
Couple of possibilities.

52
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,121
You have enlarged
lymph nodes, so

53
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,986
I'd like to start by
ruling out breast cancer.

54
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,823
And I do mean rule out.
It's probably nothing.

55
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,456
I'm gonna do
a quick breast exam.

56
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,464
Do you mind
stepping out for a moment?

57
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,592
Not at all.

58
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,398
Thai was so I could ask
about the second possibility.

59
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:03,275
<i>Left-sided pain means it could be
angina, which is made worse by stress.</i>

60
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,246
Might not be a coincidence
that the pain

61
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,751
started on the verge
of a major life change.

62
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:09,609
How did you know?

63
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,287
Blue veil means
you're a postulant,

64
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,019
haven't taken your vows yet.

65
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,751
Brown vestments
means you're Carmelites,

66
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,523
cloistered nuns,
which explains the chaperone.

67
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,534
You're about to withdraw
from the world for good.

68
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,933
I was a seminarian.

69
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,800
Who obviously
didn't take his vows.

70
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,766
Cassock made my ass look fat.

71
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,340
Do you mind unbuttoning your
shirt and lying down for me'?

72
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,778
Okay.

73
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,615
I have had second thoughts.
I'm kind of a wreck.

74
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:48,616
A life of perpetual enclosure
and almost complete silence?

75
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,287
If you weren't
wrestling with this,

76
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,229
I'd say there's something
really wrong with you.

77
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,069
I'm going to admit you.

78
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,299
There's a little mass here, and
I'd like to get it checked out.

79
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,844
It's just a benign fat
deposit, her imaging's clean.

80
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:12,178
Stress test, too. It's not angina.
So why the shoulder pain?

81
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:16,481
Is it possible that
she hurt her shoulder?

82
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:17,978
Thanks a lot.

83
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,056
I didn't tell him.

84
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,147
You were cagey about
where you were going,

85
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,260
and Chase has been
cagey in general.

86
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,523
Good chance I'd find the two
of you in the same cage,

87
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,421
so I had Park follow you.

88
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,763
How are you feeling?

89
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,199
Better.

90
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,827
Heard your arm's
healing nicely.

91
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,102
Good to see you on your feet.

92
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,503
Patient's a nu n?

93
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,940
Were you turning back to your
long-abandoned faith in time of trouble?

94
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:44,379
She was next up in the clinic.
And I don't want your help.

95
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,610
You got stabbed, you blame me.

96
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,583
But what did you learn about me

97
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,179
that you hadn't
known for years?

98
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,381
Maybe I was an idiot before,
and I'm not one now.

99
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,221
Or maybe the reverse is true.

100
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,287
Thanks for all your help.

101
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,265
Your soul sister is
having a fungal infection

102
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,433
from the unprocessed wheat
in the altar breads.

103
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,978
Explains the shoulder pain
and the jumbo lymph nodes.

104
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:25,051
Thanks for all my help.

105
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,594
I'm sorry I led House to you.

106
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,489
It's part of the job.

107
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,964
Maybe we could get
a meal after work tonight

108
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,501
if you want some companionship.

109
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,597
You asking me out on a date?

110
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:46,400
No. I just...
I guess that sounded...

111
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:52,978
Must be scary to be back.
All those knives and needles,

112
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:56,179
infected blood and tissue
everywhere you look.

113
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,524
Just thought you might need
someone to talk to about it.

114
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,785
Just knowing you're there
for me is enough. Thanks.

115
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,759
Ever surf Kirra Point?

116
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,871
Obviously you're Australian.

117
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:22,303
I've surfed all over the Gold Coast.
Don't tell me you have.

118
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:26,383
The closest I got was Waimea Bay.
I grew up on Maui.

119
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,886
If you don't mind me asking,
why are you becoming a nun?

120
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,555
You're asking because I surf?

121
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,689
Well, I know that Jesus walked
on water, but...

122
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,825
Plus the average postulant's
a lot younger than you.

123
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,867
What were
you doing before this?

124
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,461
<i>Not much of anything.
Worked as a nanny,</i>

125
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,006
moved around a lot,
bunch of failed relationships.

126
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:55,003
And then what? God spoke to you?
You heard the calling?

127
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,346
Something like that.

128
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,416
Does there have to be some dramatic
moment where the skies part?

129
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,681
Usually, yeah.

130
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,816
Is that what happened to you
when you entered the seminary'?

131
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:15,861
Mom drank, Dad worked, they
stuck me in Catholic school.

132
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:19,095
Priests and nuns were the
closest I had to family.

133
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,570
Turned out that wasn't much of a
reason to join the priesthood.

134
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,334
Is that why you left?

135
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,776
Something like that.

136
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,211
I think I may throw up.

137
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,394
What's wrong with me?

138
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,796
Not a fungal infection.

139
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,477
You're probably wondering,
why the soda balloons.

140
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,947
I'm not.

141
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,746
Well, I'll tell you.
You're not the only one

142
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,480
whose life
spiraled out of control

143
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,055
when you got
knifed in the ventricle.

144
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,384
Taub has decided...

145
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,651
I need help with my patient.

146
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,454
She's vomiting. That's not
from a fungal infection.

147
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,653
So what are you
planning to do now

148
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:18,888
that you're not working for me?

149
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,555
I have no idea.

150
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,095
Almost dying's been clarifying.
I can do anything.

151
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:27,138
You can do anything,
so you come back to

152
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,468
the same building you
worked in for years?

153
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,137
Guess you can cross
that off your bucket list.

154
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,075
Can we get to my
patient sometime soon?

155
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,979
<i>As soon as you admit that
you're a confused mess, sure.</i>

156
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,641
You'll help me.
Because even though

157
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,979
you don't find my
case interesting,

158
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,111
you find my interest
in it interesting.

159
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,590
When you put it that way...
Ascending cholangitis.

160
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,190
Missed me!

161
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,632
It can't be,
bilirubin's normal.

162
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,928
Clinical signs can show
up days before lab signs.

163
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,276
This is great, we should
make this a regular thing.

164
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,710
She can't feel her foot at all.

165
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,814
What does this mean?

166
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,624
Means I've gotta spend more time
consulting with a colleague.

167
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:34,666
His 17-ketosteroid levels are low.
How can he be...

168
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,468
He tried to tongue-kiss
Park when you were closer.

169
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,537
Think his sexuality's normal?

170
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:43,239
I need more help. My patient has
a new symptom, ischemic foot.

171
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:47,146
Get the lecture out of your system,
so we can talk about my case.

172
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:52,313
Let me start
with an allegory...

173
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,328
Okay, I'm curious...

174
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,835
Your overreaction
to your stabbing is

175
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,437
to blame me even as
you're drawn to me.

176
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:11,065
Taub's is to take moronic
self-defense classes

177
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:14,077
that won't defend
him against anything.

178
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,841
Krav Mega. Which helped
me block your shot,

179
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,574
and will continue to
help me defend myself

180
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,378
in a building full of
drugged-up strangers.

181
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,885
Taub has to accept that
by instinct and genetics,

182
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,785
he is a coward,
who's better off running

183
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,755
and hiding at
the first sign of danger.

184
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,521
I've already fended off six
of your blitzkriegs in a row.

185
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,757
And the seventh? And the eighth?
And the nth?

186
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,696
If you get him,
what's that gonna prove?

187
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,530
That unexpected things happen.

188
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,732
By definition, no class
can teach you to expect them.

189
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,363
Which is why Taub is
idiotic to study them,

190
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,932
and you're idiotic to attach
any significance to them.

191
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:47,567
Blood clot.

192
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:50,044
Her D-dimer's normal.

193
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,543
On the other hand“.

194
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,389
What if he's right about the
blockage, but wrong about the cause?

195
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,254
Vasospasm.

196
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,494
Explain everything
but the lymph nodes...

197
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,759
Any minor infection could
have caused those.

198
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,390
Calcium channel
blocker to treat.

199
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,513
Are you okay?

200
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:26,277
I almost got you killed by
bringing a scalpel into that room.

201
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,080
I could feel better about that.
You saved my life, too.

202
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,585
I think the ledger's clear.

203
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,324
But how can you
not be traumatized?

204
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,428
Can't change what happened.

205
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,460
I can only make
better choices from here.

206
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:44,090
So you're Zen about it, but won't
let go of your anger toward House.

207
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,772
I'm seeing a trauma counselor.
I think you should, too.

208
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:55,144
I'm okay. Just knowing you're
there for me is enough.

209
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,219
The convent lets you have this?

210
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,656
I borrowed it from
one of the nurses.

211
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,522
I'm still on temporary vows.

212
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,994
It may be the last time I
hear Eminem for a while.

213
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:18,463
You're using an iPod, but I've
never seen you use rosary beads.

214
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,841
What day did Jesus die?

215
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:30,243
I know, one gospel says Passover,
another says the day before.

216
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,874
How many times did the cock crow
before Peter's third denial?

217
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,680
Once or twice?

218
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,515
You can't argue away my faith.

219
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:41,591
Why'? Because it's so strong
even plain contradictions...

220
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,354
Because it's not that strong.

221
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,991
I'm not saying
I don't have faith.

222
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:51,032
I just haven't
felt the calling yet.

223
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:54,366
No one joins the clergy
without having an epiphany.

224
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,906
Like God's love is
speaking to you directly.

225
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:02,336
It's the silence,
the contemplation, the order.

226
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,707
I need them.

227
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,884
I'm hoping everything
else will come later.

228
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:15,258
That's not an answer. If you want
silence, you can get earplugs.

229
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:18,921
I tried the outside world.
It wasn't enough.

230
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,529
Have you been married?
No.

231
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,464
No kids?
You never found a career?

232
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,093
Doesn't sound like the outside
world got much of a try.

233
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:31,041
What you're
headed towards now...

234
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,904
Fourteen hours
a day in silent prayer,

235
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,236
never having a family,

236
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,471
never touching
another human being...

237
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:41,074
Just because that's what
you'd miss the most...

238
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,382
The nurses talk.

239
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,558
Nothing's wrong
with having fun.

240
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,288
They said you were almost
killed three weeks ago.

241
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,230
You go right back to fun?

242
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,794
Is that why you want to be a nun'?
Someone broke your heart?

243
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,434
No.

244
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,938
I'm just looking
for something more.

245
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:12,777
So am I.

246
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,796
I'm late for
work in the clinic.

247
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,941
Really? George Washingbaum?

248
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,343
<i>He was a character
in the Flintsteins.</i>

249
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,213
Just hiding out till
House leaves the cafeteria.

250
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,894
Those self-defense classes,

251
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,287
you think they're making
any kind of difference?

252
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,535
Not as much as
House's surprise attacks.

253
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,637
He thinks three steps ahead,
so I do, too.

254
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,304
Which is why you should accept his
apology and come back on the team.

255
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:16,208
He's annoying' he's maddening,
but he makes us all better.

256
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,081
Note to self.

257
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:28,018
Foot color's good,
arterial pulse is good,

258
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,658
capillary refill's good.

259
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,320
And her shoulder
pain's all gone.

260
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,326
Looks like you're
ready to go home.

261
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,162
I'll get the car
and meet you out front.

262
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:46,602
I'd say I'm in the book, but not the
one you'll be reading from now on.

263
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,545
Six years ago,
I was a nanny in Honolulu.

264
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,352
For this beautiful
two-year-old boy.

265
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:07,763
I loved him, probably spent more
time with him than his own parents.

266
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:13,537
One day, I was in the park,
talking with another nanny.

267
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,699
He wandered out of the
sandbox, into the street,

268
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,042
into the path of a moving car.

269
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,041
That could've
happened to anyone.

270
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,775
I don't think so.

271
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:31,646
And even if it did,
they'd blame themselves

272
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,587
for the rest of
their lives, too.

273
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,250
You shouldn't.

274
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,624
And you shouldn't run from
what can still be a good life.

275
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,157
I'm running to God.

276
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,161
After what happened to you, don't
you want to remake your life?

277
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,503
Not by hiding myself away.

278
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,271
I hope it works out for you.

279
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,808
It is gonna be hard,

280
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,947
not touching anyone.

281
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:54,061
Who knew Mother Inferior
was a smokin' hottie?

282
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,140
No wonder you're
playing handsies with her.

283
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,241
You think I'm hitting on a nun?

284
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,674
Angry at God,
or I just need a challenge?

285
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,142
Or you're
terrified of intimacy,

286
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,043
which is why
you're a serial slut,

287
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,812
but right now you're grasping
at an emotional life raft.

288
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:12,378
Ideally, someone for whom
intimacy's not an option.

289
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,014
That actually makes sense,
which I can't say

290
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,682
about anything else
you've been doing.

291
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,728
I'm not emotionally
involved with her.

292
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,161
And much as I'd love
to hear you contradict me,

293
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,926
I have a 7:30
appointment to explore

294
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,023
my intimacy issues at La Scala.

295
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,663
I'm talking to this agent
he's a bit of a sleaze,

296
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,867
but he's really excited
about representing me.

297
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,171
Although he can't take on
any new clients right now,

298
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,008
he's trying to get me an audition
for one of those online soaps.

299
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,445
Have you ever
watched one of those?

300
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,277
Am I boring you?

301
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:50,617
Unfortunately, yeah. Sorry.

302
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,271
Hi.

303
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:10,711
You're not supposed to be here.
Or anywhere.

304
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:19,120
You were right,
I was running away.

305
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,430
Oh, now you're shy.

306
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,595
It's brighter in the morning.

307
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:19,514
So, are we gonna spend the rest
of eternity in a lake of fire

308
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:23,314
while pointy-tailed demons
poke at us with sticks?

309
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:29,354
This is a little scary for me.

310
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,729
I had a whole life planned, not
that I wasn't struggling with it...

311
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:36,961
And then I met you.

312
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,501
Don't worry, I know you're
not the relationship type.

313
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,008
I'm not not the relationship type.
I was married once.

314
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:48,041
Relax.
You're fine.

315
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,413
So what's next for you?

316
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,911
I have to find a place to live,

317
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,423
get my old job back...

318
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,252
I'm sure I'll feel guilty,
start doubting...

319
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,095
Well, as long as
you keep dealing with

320
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:07,892
your doubts in
the same way, then...

321
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:12,358
Moira?

322
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,736
I'm sorry,
did you say something?

323
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,743
Your neck...
What?

324
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,840
Are your ears ringing?

325
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,174
Yeah.

326
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,607
What does that mean?

327
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,115
Let me get you back to
the hospital right away.

328
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,416
The artery
that's bringing blood

329
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,956
to your brain,
it's coming apart.

330
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,293
It means you could stroke. I've
paged a team of our best doctors.

331
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,363
I don't have to cough as much.

332
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,029
It's clotted up.

333
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,964
Is that bad?
We're almost there.

334
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,299
Get me her 02 level.

335
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:51,867
What are you doing?

336
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,774
I want to make sure I can
position her wrist properly.

337
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,436
- For what?
- ABG.

338
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,377
I don't need an ABG,
just get a pulse ox.

339
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,213
I'll do it,
grab a consent form. Go.

340
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,387
We need to
operate right now, okay?

341
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:05,988
Good. To operate.

342
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,753
Can you repeat this? "No
ifs, ands or buts about it."

343
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,729
No about it, and no ifs...

344
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:15,463
Get her into OR 11.

345
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,838
Carotid dissection,
four-inch pulsatile mass

346
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,740
in her neck,
and some Broca's aphasia.

347
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,643
There's gotta be a clot
keeping her from bleeding out.

348
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:30,736
Pulse?

349
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,612
Bounding, four-plus.
It was a three-plus

350
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,241
twenty minutes ago.

351
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:35,983
Twenty?

352
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:37,281
I thought she just got here.

353
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:44,159
That blood looks pretty dry.
Cut yourself shaving?

354
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,494
You know, that can
happen when the nun

355
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,530
you woke up with
coughs blood on you.

356
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:52,100
You slept with a nun?

357
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,134
Forget nun,
you slept with a patient?

358
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,831
Former. To both.

359
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,135
Internal neck trauma?
That's impressive.

360
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:01,107
It's happened to me
a few times. Up high.

361
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,671
Dr. Chase.

362
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:09,517
The clot's broken. Bring
her in and pack her nose.

363
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:10,985
We're gonna need
number three Vicryls.

364
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,989
We're gonna fix this.

365
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,319
You're not going
to operate on her?

366
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,018
Kapur and Carlyle
are unavailable,

367
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:18,186
Reilly's done far fewer
dissections than I have.

368
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,320
He's also slept with her far
fewer times than you have.

369
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,558
Your judgment's compromised.

370
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,527
I spent the night with her, doesn't
change how I make an incision.

371
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:25,966
Tell him.

372
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,504
Do the surgery.

373
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:32,139
You're trying to
score points with him

374
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:33,574
at the risk of
a patient's life.

375
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,009
He's the better surgeon.

376
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,549
Vascular clamp. You're not
going to put her on bypass?

377
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,880
It'd take a half
hour to set up.

378
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,248
You clamp now,
she could stroke out.

379
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:46,687
She's already got
neurological symptoms.

380
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,816
We wait 30 minutes, she'll
definitely have brain damage.

381
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,259
You're trying to make sure
she's either perfect or dead.

382
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,091
She's not going to die.
If I get this done

383
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,993
in five minutes,
she won't stroke out.

384
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,328
You don't know that you will.

385
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,232
And you can't know because you
can't think clearly about her.

386
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,496
Vascular clamp.

387
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:13,708
Occlusion time,
9:46, 23 seconds.

388
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,547
Vascular scissors.

389
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,444
We're over five minutes.

390
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,217
Ultrasound.

391
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,798
Good flow.
Lighten the anesthesia.

392
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,796
You're not going to
close the wound first?

393
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:07,893
No.

394
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,315
Can you hear me?

395
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:32,151
Repeat this.
"No ifs, ands or buts."

396
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,363
"No ifs, ands or buts."

397
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:45,670
I'm sorry about before.

398
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:49,673
You're scared, aren't you?

399
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,338
That's why you
wanted companionship.

400
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,643
It's why you cried out
when House shot at Taub.

401
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,782
What exactly are you scared of?

402
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:59,456
A needle stick? Some other
nut pulling a scalpel?

403
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,053
I'm scared of everything.

404
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,823
It sucks that there was a
stabbing, but you'll get over it.

405
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:08,356
Like you have?

406
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:12,200
You weren't even there.
I know. I...

407
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:15,135
I left the room,
it was pure luck...

408
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:18,138
I was in the room.
That was pure luck, too.

409
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:25,342
I get that you're scared and guilty.
You're still a doctor.

410
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,677
I don't have time to
teach you to act like one.

411
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,383
We removed the artery,
found nodules.

412
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,222
Could mean lupus.

413
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:40,354
Negative ANA.
Where are you going?

414
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:44,000
Great thing about assigning
Taub fraudulent lab work

415
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,935
is you know exactly
where he's gonna end up.

416
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:50,598
Great thing about assigning Taub
obviously fraudulent lab work

417
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:53,176
is you get to watch
his inner paranoiac at work.

418
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,680
And then,

419
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,783
two to the head.

420
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,356
Can we talk about my patient?

421
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:08,925
Quite a journey.

422
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:10,925
Starts with a surgical
tool in your heart,

423
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,927
and ends with
a surgeon's tool in a nun.

424
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,087
What's the plan?
The plan's to cure her.

425
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:20,199
If it's not meaningless sex, kinda
screams out for an end-game.

426
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:24,036
You're the dog that's chasing the Popemobile.
You sure you want...

427
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:26,967
Oh, my God.

428
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,276
Taub is interrogating
the janitor.

429
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:34,714
He must think that
I hired him to attack.

430
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:38,050
Actually, why didn't I do that?

431
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:42,655
Plaques could be
confused for nodules.

432
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:44,591
Which would mean...
Syphilis?

433
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,260
Explains the shoulder
and foot involvement.

434
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,900
Hope you practiced
immaculate contraception.

435
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,074
Lock and load.

436
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:01,567
Boo-yam

437
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,246
Boo-yah to you, too.

438
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,981
But I hadn't had sex in years.

439
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:13,454
Tertiary syphilis
means you've had

440
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,955
the disease for
at least that long.

441
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:17,423
Does that mean
you also have it?

442
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,827
Probably not
contagious at this point.

443
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,762
Can it cause hallucinations?

444
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:27,968
It's unlikely. Why?

445
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:35,441
While I was on the operating table,
it didn't feel like a dream,

446
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,971
I saw the boy who
I was caring for,

447
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,110
the one who died.

448
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,181
He walked right up to me.

449
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,288
What did he say?

450
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,454
He just held my hand.

451
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:55,124
It was like he forgave me.

452
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,501
Do you think that's crazy?

453
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:05,039
I think it should give you
solace, help you to move on.

454
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,977
You slept with your patient?

455
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:19,981
You're off the case.

456
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:22,685
I saved her from brain damage.

457
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,489
You think my judgment's
the least bit compromised?

458
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,257
She's still sick.
If she dies, we'll be

459
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,229
in the middle of
a brand new investigation.

460
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:30,994
This is about you
covering your own ass?

461
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,600
I gave you time, leeway,

462
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,900
and you decided to do
whatever the hell you wanted.

463
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,701
House can dance
all over the rules,

464
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:39,674
gets me knifed,
and he gets a pass.

465
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,502
I break a rule,
no one gets hurt,

466
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,170
but you kick me
off my own case?

467
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,845
Unfortunately, yes.

468
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,854
I'm sorry. I took
that scalpel for you.

469
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,585
That's why I did this.

470
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:59,385
Three weeks ago, you never would
have slept with a patient.

471
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:02,055
And you never would have
operated on her after.

472
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:05,129
You need help.

473
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:08,727
I need to get away from House and
everything that reminds me of him.

474
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,273
By breaking the rules, not
caring what anyone else thinks?

475
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,905
You're gonna get away from
him by turning into him'?

476
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,577
It hurts.

477
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,733
Right upper quadrant,
pain and distension.

478
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,169
What's wrong with my stomach?

479
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,795
Nothing. This is your liver.

480
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:52,942
The liver failure could be from
intraoperative hypotension.

481
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,517
Checked the anesthesia sheet,
pressure was fine throughout.

482
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:56,608
Thrombus?

483
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,415
That voice in the hall that
none of us have any reason

484
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,357
to be listening to is,
not surprisingly, wrong.

485
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:04,951
Abdominal
ultrasound was negative.

486
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,756
Then we have to
assume liver failure's

487
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,923
just another symptom
of whatever she's got.

488
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:12,458
Trousseau's syndrome could send
clots, cause the ischemic foot,

489
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,935
add the enlarged lymph node,
macrocytosis...

490
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,939
Disseminated
T-cell lymphoma.

491
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,001
Wilson said it wasn't cancer.

492
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,134
Wilson says it's
not breast cancer.

493
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:23,768
Sarcoidosis.

494
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:24,936
Normal ACE level.

495
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,448
Highly insensitive for sarcoid.

496
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,017
Negative chest X-rays aren't.

497
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,278
Then we've gotta biopsy.

498
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,844
Yeah, Foreman's clearly wrong.

499
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,116
You're clearly not
grasping at straws,

500
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,284
because you're clearly not
emotionally involved.

501
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,723
I know you want to
believe this is something

502
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:42,492
we can cure.
It's not. I'm sorry.

503
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,070
How soon will they
know if it's cancer?

504
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,841
Within hours.

505
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,314
And if ii is?

506
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,384
There's always chemo.

507
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:07,714
You say that like
it's not gonna work.

508
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,488
It could extend your life.

509
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,592
Years?

510
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,829
I'll be here as
much as you need.

511
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:27,067
You still never told me
why you left the seminary.

512
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,006
Mary Knoller.

513
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,677
Wife of the groundskeeper.

514
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:39,121
He caught me with her,
got me with a rake.

515
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,714
Those scars on my ass you may
have noticed...

516
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,790
Why didn't you
tell me that before?

517
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:47,557
Because it was so shallow.

518
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:51,190
I wasn't exactly wrestling with
great theological questions.

519
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,533
I don't believe that.

520
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:55,933
You don't sleep with
the groundskeeper's wife,

521
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:59,406
not unless you're struggling
with whether you belong there.

522
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:07,740
I always wanted to believe.
Would've made my life a lot easier.

523
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,278
It never took.

524
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:13,746
Doesn't

525
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:15,547
mean

526
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,724
it's too late.

527
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,660
Are you having trouble
talking, like before?

528
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:25,231
I can get the words out...

529
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,570
Just feels heavy when I do.

530
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:28,962
Where?

531
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,837
Wherever my
chewing muscles are.

532
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:35,575
I'll be right back.

533
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,312
House finally got you?

534
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:43,852
He tried, but...
I gotta go.

535
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:46,320
You should have seen it, it was perfect.

536
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,084
She has jaw claudication.

537
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,457
If you only heard claudication
and carotid dissection...

538
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:58,189
I'd say giant cell arteritis,

539
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:02,530
and I'd tell your former teammates
to put her on steroids.

540
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,432
She's gonna live.

541
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,600
Yeah.

542
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:08,503
And then what?

543
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,551
They say my liver
function's better,

544
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,345
that I can get
out of here soon.

545
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:22,550
And when you do' I want to
take you to Puerto Escondido.

546
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:24,650
Mexico?

547
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:25,853
The Mexican Pipeline.

548
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:29,196
Early May is when the surf
really picks up, but...

549
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,495
What's wrong?

550
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:36,872
I spoke to the prioress...

551
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:38,900
You're going back?

552
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:41,142
I felt the calling.

553
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,237
When you saw the boy?

554
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:48,916
I felt God's love, his grace. I've
been waiting my entire life for that.

555
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:50,247
It's not real.

556
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:53,481
I know you didn't feel anything
when you almost died. I did.

557
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:58,051
You fell oxygen deprivation, you felt
your brain releasing noradrenaline.

558
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,027
You didn't say that before.

559
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,522
I wanted you to
move on with your life.

560
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:06,501
I wanted to reassure you.
I wanted you to feel better.

561
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:08,698
And now you don't?

562
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,596
Now...

563
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,168
I think I love you.

564
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:31,126
"Noradrenaline and Near-Death
Experiences." Oh, dear.

565
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:32,354
You saw God?

566
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:36,565
She did. She wants to go
back to the monastery.

567
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,124
And now you're preparing
a PowerPoint presentation

568
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:42,364
to keep her in your garden
of earthly delights.

569
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,270
You're an idiot.

570
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,739
Because I've
found someone I love?

571
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,708
Because you're an idiot.

572
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,940
At least you two
have that in common.

573
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:54,039
Her feelings are based on a chemical process.
They're gonna wear off.

574
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:58,318
You just slept with her, your
brain is exploding with oxytocin.

575
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,047
You think that's gonna last
through the ages?

576
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,318
She's throwing away her life
because of blind faith.

577
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:03,551
So are you.

578
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,320
She's found something she wants
to build her life around.

579
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:09,890
It's a total illusion,
but apparently she'll take

580
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,160
a little ignorance
with her bliss.

581
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,792
And you want to take that away.

582
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:15,337
How many times have you thrown
the truth in people's faces?

583
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,133
Because it's the truth.
Not because

584
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:19,003
we're gonna live
happily ever after.

585
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,075
Either your
relationship just blows up

586
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,510
like every other
non-magical romance,

587
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,412
or she stays with you
but blames you for

588
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,509
stripping all
the meaning out of her life.

589
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:32,845
This has nothing to
do with the truth.

590
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,424
You don't like that
I'm reassessing my life,

591
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,026
that I want to
change it, that I can.

592
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:41,188
Anyone can screw up a life. I
never said that wasn't possible.

593
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:43,288
You're incapable
of human connection,

594
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,458
so you want
everyone to be like you.

595
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,762
If I wanted you to be like me,

596
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:57,443
I would be urging you to make
a stupid, stubborn decision

597
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:00,381
that blows up your life and
leaves you lonely and miserable.

598
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:10,292
You reassess your life
when you've made mistakes.

599
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,726
You didn't.
You just got stabbed.

600
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:14,753
Don't look at the book.

601
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:17,258
I haven't done a jugular line
since my residency,

602
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,589
I don't want to
needle the carotid.

603
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:24,291
What's the first step?

604
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:28,369
- Palpate the SCM.
- Where?

605
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,267
Middle third of the neck.

606
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:03,833
I'm happy I knew you.

607
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,241
So am I.

608
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,255
Robert.

609
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,319
Twenty-four-year-old
water treatment worker

610
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,421
with pyrexia and double vision.

611
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:28,756
A mystery.

612
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,657
How'd he get sick
working in a sewer?

613
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,719
Ed Norton was
the picture of health.

614
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,670
Abscess?

615
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:52,172
Would have seen it on the MRI.

616
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,409
Diphtheria paralyzing
the ocular muscles?

617
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,243
No, paralysis
was first. Aneurysm?
