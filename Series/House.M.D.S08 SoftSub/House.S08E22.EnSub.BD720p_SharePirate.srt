1
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,508
Hey.

2
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,034
Don't bother.

3
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,205
He's dead.

4
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,275
You're dead, too.

5
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:13,711
The fire isn't.

6
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,102
You might want to get up and start
heading for the exit signs.

7
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,227
For all I know,

8
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,930
I already am up.

9
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,167
More interesting question is,

10
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,403
why would I hallucinate
an ex-employee

11
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,243
who I last saw with a
self-inﬂicted gunshot wound,

12
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,147
as opposed to
someone more busty?

13
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,314
Care to explain
why you're here?

14
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:22,409
The dead guy.

15
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,453
Who is he?

16
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:26,921
How'd you meet him?

17
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,825
I was in a car accident
last month.

18
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,928
I won a swimming trophy in high school.
Your turn.

19
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,038
I ran out of pain medication.

20
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,938
I got an orbital fracture.
It's just taking ages to heal.

21
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,998
Take off your shirt.

22
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:46,933
My eye's up here.

23
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,342
Orbital fracture means your
face went into the windshield.

24
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,781
Which means your chest
went into the steering wheel.

25
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,841
Painkillers can
suppress heart rate,

26
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,113
so unless you want me
to kill you,

27
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,985
take off your shirt,
let me do a heart exam.

28
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,661
I also wanted to see the ring of
burns around your collarbone.

29
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,499
How did you know?
The "codeine allergy"

30
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,873
you told the nurse about, that's shorthand
for "give me the strong stuff,"

31
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,570
which matches
your seen-better-days

32
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,147
- because-my-life-fell-apart
suit.

33
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,544
The two old burns
on your fingers

34
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:25,878
mean you tend to nod off
with a cigarette

35
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,350
in your hand. No reason you shouldn't
do that with one in your mouth.

36
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:31,186
May all your doctors be stupid.

37
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,081
Hold on a second.

38
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,490
That bruising
around your belly button.

39
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:46,430
You might get some fun drugs
out of this after all.

40
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,734
<i>Cullen's sign,</i>

41
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:52,834
but the ultrasound showed
air as well as blood. Now,

42
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:56,176
I know what you're thinking.
Hemorrhagic pancreatitis.

43
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,172
But I also know
what I'm thinking.

44
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,717
Doesn't explain
the pneumoperitoneum.

45
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:01,878
You took a new case?

46
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,117
You ran tests yourself?

47
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:10,090
I saw the chance to help someone
in need, and I instinctively...

48
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,060
No, wait, that was
someone else's instincts.

49
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,529
Wilson's dying,
your parole officer

50
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,090
is probably on his
way here right now.

51
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,260
How are you possibly
in a good mood?

52
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,703
<i>Did you never see Dead Poets Society?
 Carpe diem.</i>

53
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:26,037
Air in his abdomen could
mean blah, blah, blah.

54
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:29,273
But blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

55
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,541
Blah, blah, blah.

56
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,207
Nobody cares
about the medicine.

57
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,778
Perforated ulcer.

58
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,946
Laparotomy to find the hole
in his tummy and close it up.

59
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,283
You didn't answer
the team's question.

60
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,949
Which is weird 'cause normally
when I talk to my own employees,

61
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,049
I'm under oath and hooked
up to a lie detector.

62
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,595
You were looking at
six months of prison

63
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,062
instead of five months
of Wilson.

64
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:47,131
Why happy?

65
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,392
Obviously I had a plan.

66
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,957
Obviously,
obviously you had a plan.

67
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,160
The more
interesting question is,

68
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,737
why you didn't tell the team.

69
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,601
I think it's because part
of you knew from the start

70
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,504
that the plan wouldn't work.

71
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,239
I need a meeting.

72
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,576
I'm busy.
Call my office.

73
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:05,948
Yes.

74
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,576
Because wobbly tables don't just
un-wobble themselves.

75
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,256
I need a meeting.

76
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,352
Thanks for fitting me in.

77
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,657
My team has eight urgent,
life-or-death cases

78
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,755
that they've been waiting
for me to accept or reject.

79
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,333
When is that not true?

80
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,262
Well, right now for one.

81
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,936
But tell my parole board
that I'm taking all eight.

82
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:31,932
That no one else
can crack them,

83
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,443
that you need me here
for the next five months

84
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,274
or eight people will die.

85
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,006
You're asking me
to perjure myself.

86
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,676
Just a tiny white lie.
No of fence.

87
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:44,187
Especially since from what I
hear nothing black is tiny.

88
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,281
Except your penis, I guess.

89
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,452
You really think I wanted
to cave in that ceiling?

90
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,520
It was a prank that went wrong.

91
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:53,859
Dock my pay, sue me...

92
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,365
Felony vandalism
should've added

93
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,661
another year or two
to your sentence.

94
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,067
It's a miracle the parole
board agreed to six months.

95
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,739
I will go to jail.
Eventually.

96
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,706
I will pay the price. I'd just
rather that Wilson didn't.

97
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,312
Come on.
Be a friend.

98
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,485
Okay.

99
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:23,494
But whatever cases you have,
you have to take them all.

100
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,867
"Be a friend"?

101
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,840
How many fingers
am I holding up?

102
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,574
Of course, you know it's three

103
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,940
because you know
everything I know,

104
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,547
everything my smack-addled
brain can remember.

105
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,674
Including that I actually
said, "Be a friend."

106
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,946
My point wasn't
that you said it.

107
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,112
My point was, once again, why?

108
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,382
I think it's because
part of you knew

109
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,548
you were going
to need a friend.

110
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,193
Part of you knew the plan, even
when it was working, wouldn't work.

111
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,090
And right now, I'm curious about
why you're sitting on the ground

112
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,563
instead of heading
for the door.

113
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,540
Guess we've figured out
why you're seeing me,

114
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,707
your suicidal friend.

115
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:22,585
He'll call you twice a day. Then
his wife will call you twice a day

116
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,248
to make sure she understands
what he told her you told him.

117
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,485
Which she won't,
because he didn't.

118
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,150
Maybe you want to
give this one to Connors.

119
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,118
Where's House?

120
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,088
Don't know,
don't care, working.

121
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,235
Excuse me.

122
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,068
No one has seen or heard from
him since two nights ago.

123
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,612
I'm sure he's enjoying himself.

124
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,738
Last time he went to prison

125
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,907
he maxed out his credit cards.

126
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:55,113
Last time he went to prison, he
thought he had you waiting for him.

127
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,980
You think he could have
done something stupid?

128
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,591
I think stupid is
our best-case scenario.

129
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,624
Why do you want
to kill yourself?

130
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:10,259
Here's a reason. I can't even get
stoned without some annoying jerk

131
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,031
deciding I need to
be deeply analyzed.

132
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,767
Isn't this just an incredibly
simple calculation?

133
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:22,109
I'm going to jail, losing my
job, losing my best friend.

134
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,169
Do I need more?

135
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,215
You think that's the sum
total of who you are?

136
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,807
A doctor, a friend to Wilson?

137
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,716
I'm also a tremendous baritone.

138
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,220
Now go away.

139
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,288
Even with your subconscious,
you're evasive.

140
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,163
Death's not interesting.

141
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,198
You exist for
what's interesting.

142
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,065
Puzzles' ideas, analysis.

143
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,368
Death is the opposite
of a cool puzzle.

144
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,298
It's eternal nothingness.

145
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,478
But you don't find life
interesting anymore.

146
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,985
Stop being an idiot.

147
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,158
Can I have Kutner back, please?

148
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,889
How much pathetic wallowing
do I have to sit through?

149
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,259
How are things in hell?

150
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,832
Is the humidity the big issue?

151
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,664
What happened next with
the guy's medical case?

152
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,403
Why?
Exactly.

153
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,337
Why am I, meaning you,

154
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,874
still obsessing
about this case?

155
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,910
Obviously,
we think it's relevant

156
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:31,744
to why we're still sitting on
the ﬂoor of a burning building.

157
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,243
There was a code.

158
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,350
Gotta be a clot in his lungs.
We need to get him to an OR.

159
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,393
No time,
his O2 sats are falling.

160
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:43,553
We have to suck it out here,

161
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,526
- bedside embolectomy.
- Float a catheter through his heart

162
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,428
and his oxygenation'll
get even worse.

163
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,023
He'll die before we can
finish the procedure.

164
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,595
House, we need a call here.

165
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,365
What are you doing?

166
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,471
What did you give him?

167
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:04,738
Five,

168
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,072
four,

169
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,483
three, two...

170
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,550
Naloxone.

171
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,252
We should have got suspicious

172
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:23,458
when his visiting cousin
signed in as Mr. Tar H. Horse.

173
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,001
The heroin caused
the respiratory distress,

174
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,005
the naloxone turned off the
receptors, causing your distress.

175
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,735
I'm not going to
stop doing drugs!

176
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,405
It's reality that sucks!

177
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,651
You're saying I'm lying?
To my subconscious?

178
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,588
People do it all the time. And
like it or not, you are a person.

179
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,850
He said every one of those...

180
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,288
But not then.
And not like that.

181
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,949
This guy was going nuts
from the naloxone.

182
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,857
He couldn't be rational
if you wanted him to be.

183
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,362
Which you did. Why?

184
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,659
I compressed
the story a little to...

185
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:55,824
Context matters.

186
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,964
You never talk to patients
for non-diagnostic reasons.

187
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,594
But this guy...

188
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,638
Feeling better?

189
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,017
I'm not going to
stop doing drugs.

190
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:19,283
You were a stockbroker,
son of a stockbroker,

191
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,653
married, children...

192
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,782
And I was miserable.

193
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,161
You say you were miserable

194
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,733
because you need to
rationalize screwing it up.

195
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,893
Except I didn't.

196
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,800
I mean, I did,

197
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,573
but I'm not miserable.

198
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,166
Not anymore.

199
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:44,180
I had a ski injury

200
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,545
and painkillers weren't enough

201
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,643
and a friend of mine
gave me some heroin.

202
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,320
The second it entered
my veins, it was like

203
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,165
God had taken over my body.

204
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,926
It was like there was
no more pain

205
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,871
or unhappiness in my life
or anybody else's.

206
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,241
But then you lost everything.

207
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,376
Everything wasn't enough.

208
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,186
Because it's reality
that sucks.

209
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:31,253
Are you arguing that
he's a good role model?

210
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:32,762
He's happy.

211
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:33,853
He's dead.

212
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:36,795
You heard what
you wanted to hear.

213
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,562
The more interesting question,

214
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,865
always, is why you
wanted to hear it.

215
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,386
You're stealing
this guy's oxygen?

216
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,384
There's oxygen everywhere.

217
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,082
You passed on all your cases,

218
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,456
reassigned them
to other doctors.

219
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,418
They weren't interesting.

220
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,553
They were my reason for getting
your sentence delayed.

221
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,997
Yeah, I guess
you'll have to tell

222
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,726
the parole board
something else.

223
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,430
Maybe that I was in the OR the
entire day the ceiling collapsed,

224
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,406
so I couldn't have caused
the plumbing problem.

225
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,939
You set me up.
Not really.

226
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,104
You were going lo
basically perjure yourself

227
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,738
so that I could
delay jail time.

228
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,010
Doesn't it make more sense
to actually perjure yourself

229
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,278
so I can actually
avoid jail time?

230
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,455
Why are you doing this?

231
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,321
Why are you risking
destroying yourself?

232
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,587
There is no risk.
I know you.

233
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,626
You'll do the honest thing.

234
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,130
You'll lie.

235
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,363
No.

236
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,114
He's happy.

237
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,986
He's dead.

238
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,791
You weren't worried.

239
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,354
Of course I was worried.
My plan fell through.

240
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:17,401
The plan didn't matter. Your plan
to replace that plan didn't matter.

241
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,398
Wilson didn't matter,
jail didn't matter,

242
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:21,897
the only thing that mattered,

243
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:25,464
the only thing that ever
mattered was the puzzle.

244
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,351
I noticed a slight twitch
in his thenar eminence.

245
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,414
<i>Which meant...</i>

246
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,887
You're dying.

247
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,355
Because my thumb
is a little shaky?

248
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,188
Plus the thinning
of the muscle.

249
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,423
Plus that speech you gave
at Yankee Stadium

250
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,329
saying you were the luckiest
man on the face of the earth.

251
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,026
Add them up, it means ALS.

252
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,932
Lou Gehrig's disease?

253
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,834
You're trapped in your body.
You can't move or speak

254
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,244
while you just die?

255
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,505
If it makes you
feel any better,

256
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,104
at this rate, it'll be fast.

257
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,883
You're not symmetrical.

258
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:13,946
Wait.

259
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,218
Now you're standing
at the door.

260
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,385
What happened in the meantime?

261
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,928
And lo, there was a miraculous wonder.
I walked across the room...

262
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,057
No, you just skipped over
a chunk of conversation.

263
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,625
He swore that he'd live a
better, more selfless life

264
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,432
in his remaining lime,
blah, blah, blah.

265
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:30,736
After two blahs, I'd heard
enough and I moved to the door.

266
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,777
No. You're avoiding it.

267
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,375
Do you smell smoke?

268
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,147
Fair enough.

269
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,650
You're not symmetrical.

270
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,981
The veins on your right
side are distended.

271
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,080
What does that mean?

272
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,957
There's a bulge
in your supraclavicular notch.

273
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,220
There's something in there.

274
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,286
What?

275
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,291
I'm not that good a doctor.

276
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,011
Good news.

277
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,606
Your case is fascinating.

278
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,513
And good news for you,

279
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:16,847
you're gonna live.

280
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,786
<i>You've inhaled a small branch,</i>

281
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,483
<i>probably while you were realizing
that it's all worth it</i>

282
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,619
<i>while you were passed out
on a park bench.</i>

283
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,990
<i>Anyone else would have coughed it
up, but 'cause you're a junkie,</i>

284
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,929
<i>your cough reflex
is suppressed.</i>

285
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,092
And it grew?

286
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,136
<i>Not unless you also
inhaled a chunk of the sun</i>

287
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,138
<i>and a drip-irrigation
system, you idiot.</i>

288
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:39,301
<i>It set off an autoimmune reaction
which, and I can't help saying this,</i>

289
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,641
<i>was the root of
all your problems.</i>

290
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,839
You're smiling.

291
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,381
I was, and now I'm not.

292
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,015
Because a moment's
fun a few days ago

293
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,786
does not trump a friend dying.

294
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,191
Yeah, it does, you idiot.

295
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,527
Because after he's dead
you cry for a while

296
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,792
and then you go back
to doing what you love.

297
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,398
Every patient I've had,

298
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:09,029
in 70 years from now, they'll
all be as dead as Wilson.

299
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,301
Everybody dies.
It's meaningless.

300
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:12,670
When you solve a puzzle,

301
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,846
the world makes sense
and everything feels right.

302
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,541
And you'll always
have another one,

303
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,016
because people
will always get sick.

304
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,882
It's shallow and
it's insignificant,

305
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,818
but if you don't give
a damn if idiots live,

306
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,086
why would you possibly give
a damn about shallowness?

307
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,656
It makes you happy.

308
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,493
And why would you
need more than that?

309
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,031
Go home.

310
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,036
Foreman.

311
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,208
House would never leave food
out here rotting for days.

312
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,645
His suitcases are
in his closet.

313
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,609
If we had handled
this differently...

314
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,619
We did the right thing.

315
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,821
Hello?

316
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,895
I'll let his accountant know.

317
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,563
House no-showed on a
hooker two nights ago.

318
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,798
Outgoing calls.

319
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,073
Hooker.

320
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,348
Me. I didn't pick up.

321
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,812
The Chinese place...

322
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,843
Wait, wait, wait.
Who's that?

323
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,816
He called four times.

324
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,911
I don't know.

325
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,387
It's a total disaster. Do you
have any idea how hard it is

326
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:24,696
to schedule a cable appointment
with the hours that I work?

327
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,770
House has been missing for two
days, we know he talked to you.

328
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,896
Anything you can tell
us about his mental state,

329
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,598
or where he was headed,
anything at all...

330
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,233
Would be a breach of confidentiality
and a violation of the law.

331
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,710
Not if he's a danger to
himself or someone else.

332
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,880
Is this coming out
of our 50 minutes?

333
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,279
Is this your douchebag group?

334
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,176
Excuse me.

335
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,619
What makes you think
he's a danger to himself?

336
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,422
He hasn't been home, but he
didn't take anything with him,

337
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,292
not even his cell.

338
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,359
You're not saying anything,

339
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,459
which means he didn't
specifically mention suicide.

340
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,093
But you came out here
to talk to us,

341
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,196
so he must've said something
that worries you.

342
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,306
There are other ways
of reaching oblivion.

343
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,707
Vicodin? He always
has his Vicodin,

344
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:11,372
there's no reason
to calla shrink...

345
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,915
His last patient
was a heroin addict.

346
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,079
So I guess we're all done here.

347
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,389
The guy's address has
gotta be in the file.

348
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,488
What about God?

349
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,595
You were leaving,
and then you stopped.

350
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:32,964
Why?

351
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,596
Your theory is I'm not leaving
because I believe in God?

352
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,469
What?
He's calling me home?

353
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:41,067
Maybe falling through
that floor was a sign.

354
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,340
Maybe that the universe
hates you. Something.

355
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,439
You really don't believe?

356
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,312
Really, not in some deep
crack of some remote recess

357
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,822
of some dark corner
of your mind?

358
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:55,256
No.

359
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,789
Except that some deep crack
of some remote recess

360
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,829
of some dark corner
is here telling me...

361
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,864
That's enough.

362
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:05,527
In a burning building, facing imminent
death, that's more than enough.

363
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,698
Pascal's wager is facile.

364
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:10,034
Saying it's facile is facile.

365
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,874
Why is it wrong?

366
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,137
Don't be logical.
Be desperate.

367
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:19,446
You've gotta have
something to hold on to.

368
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:23,550
But you can't live your life based
on something you don't believe.

369
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:27,556
But you could end your life based
on something you don't believe?

370
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:28,886
What about love?

371
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:33,295
I lived with you for years.
I know you believe in love.

372
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:39,394
Foreman wouldn't help me.

373
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:43,565
Which means I need you
to take the fall.

374
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,234
You do remember
I'm dying, right?

375
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:49,313
Which is why you'll never
spend a day in jail.

376
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:52,180
Fresh-faced,
cancer-ridden.

377
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:53,842
It's tough to do both,
but you pull it off.

378
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:55,577
Your fingerprints are all
over those hockey tickets.

379
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,154
I never admitted to
flushing anything.

380
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:01,555
My prints make sense if I
gave those tickets to you,

381
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,149
as an incentive to stay alive.

382
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,329
And I was so angry that you
didn't respect my dying wishes,

383
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,524
Hook thousands of
dollars of season tickets

384
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:09,895
and ﬂushed them down toilets?

385
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,833
All you have to do
is create reasonable doubt.

386
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,394
Great. What if I do
more than that?

387
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,665
What if I end up in jail?

388
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,232
Or spending my final months
in endless hearings?

389
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,574
That's a risk
you're willing to take.

390
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,613
I have a reputation, I have
a legacy that could...

391
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,186
Wilson.

392
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:35,553
I don't want to lose
this time with you.

393
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:46,696
Okay.

394
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,204
Thanks.

395
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,768
I knew I could count on you.

396
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,382
Wait! Wait!

397
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,223
You want the fries back?

398
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,121
I'm not gonna take the fall.

399
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,561
Don't do this to me, Wilson.

400
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,334
It's our only option.
Exactly.

401
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:24,669
Because you overplayed
your hand with Foreman.

402
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,767
Because you knew
you had me as a backstop.

403
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,744
Even with me dying,
you just assumed

404
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:31,907
I'd be here to bail you out.

405
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,843
Since you are here,
and you are bailing me out

406
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,443
seems like
a pretty safe assumption.

407
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,083
Hey!

408
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,657
I won't be here soon.

409
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,524
If I do this, I'm teaching you

410
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,688
that your bad behavior
will always be rewarded.

411
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,026
You need to learn.“

412
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,998
How to act when you're gone?

413
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,661
If that's the lesson, we've a
really great opportunity coming up.

414
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,966
You'll just try to find someone
else, and it won't work,

415
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,165
and it shouldn't work.

416
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,469
So that's the great wisdom
you're imparting?

417
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:00,975
That I'll always be alone?

418
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,274
There's only one person
you can count on.

419
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,820
I thought there were two.

420
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,518
I need to do this.

421
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:16,820
For you.

422
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:28,631
Wilson's right.

423
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:31,965
He's always right. He's
always been your good side.

424
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,377
I always wondered why I
photographed so poorly.

425
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,041
And because he's
always played that role,

426
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,481
you've never had to develop
a conscience of your own.

427
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:45,712
People don't change. Consciences
don't spontaneously develop.

428
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,687
You're wrong, Greg.

429
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:54,487
Which is why you'll be
better off without him.

430
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:02,162
You've been looking to him to find what
you've gotta find within yourself.

431
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:07,605
Something you can find.

432
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,388
Hold your child.

433
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,605
This is a reason to die.

434
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:51,149
This is what my life could
have been, not what it can be.

435
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:52,483
If it could have been,

436
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,748
you're capable of it now.

437
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,827
You're married, Cuddy's gone.

438
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,592
We aren't the only two
people who could love you.

439
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,099
Why settle so easily?

440
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,942
These are just
idiotic fantasies.

441
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:22,975
Greg, don't.

442
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:27,285
At odds with every
logical bone in my body.

443
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:28,620
Get up.

444
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:31,752
You do not have to die in here!

445
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,034
Is this hell?

446
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:51,676
An eternity of people trying
to convince me to live?

447
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:59,854
Who says I'm hereto
convince you to live?

448
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:08,395
You're the last one
I thought would hate me.

449
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:09,693
I don't hate you.

450
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,133
I love you.

451
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,067
And yet you think
I deserve to die.

452
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,538
But not as a punishment

453
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,008
As a reward.

454
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:24,913
I think

455
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,710
you've suffered enough.

456
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,580
You've given enough.

457
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:33,487
I think you deserve
a chance to just

458
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,650
give up

459
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,091
Like Wilson did?

460
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,198
Like Wilson did.

461
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:48,567
You accepted his choice that ending
the pain is better than the pain.

462
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,038
Why can't you give
yourself that gift?

463
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,048
This is the address
House's patient gave?

464
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,250
Everybody lies.

465
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,728
Do you smell smoke?

466
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,887
Just lei go.

467
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,418
Just go to sleep.

468
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:49,565
I had a chance to avoid this.

469
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,727
You had many chances,
and you blew them all up.

470
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,800
No, this was different.

471
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:00,632
They're all different. But the
reasons are all the same.

472
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,406
You're arrogant
You're self-destructive.

473
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,011
You only care about yourself.

474
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:10,018
That moment with the patient.

475
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,754
That chunk of conversation
I skipped over.

476
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,763
I told him he was dying.

477
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:21,325
If it makes you
feel any better,

478
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,866
at this rate, it'll be fast.

479
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,871
Let me take the fall.

480
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:38,704
For you.
For that prank.

481
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,377
You don't owe me anything.

482
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,510
You tried to save me.

483
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,716
I failed. Motives don't matter.
Only actions.

484
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:50,657
Trying is an action.

485
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,058
Why are you trying to
talk me out of this?

486
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:57,464
You just fake the records, you say
I came into the clinic last week.

487
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,695
I'll tell the cops
you treated me like crap.

488
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,837
So I stole your tickets
and ﬂushed them.

489
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,343
Thank you.

490
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,262
And you're doing this
because you're dying?

491
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,854
I'm doing this because I
have nothing left to lose.

492
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:35,327
So when you were living, you did
nothing for anyone and didn't care.

493
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:40,275
Now that you're dying, you're
willing to help a virtual stranger.

494
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:44,507
Which means you're a better person
dying than you ever were living.

495
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:49,011
And the world's a better place
because I didn't save you.

496
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,788
Which makes me wonder
why I'm about to tell you,

497
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,527
you're not symmetrical.

498
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,598
What's your point?

499
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,462
That you cared about him more
than you cared about yourself?

500
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:09,371
You cared about the puzzle more
than you cared about yourself.

501
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:14,603
If I kept it to myself, then
it would just be a puzzle.

502
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,940
But I opened my mouth because
I thought it was more.

503
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,947
You know it's the same or you
wouldn't be bickering with me

504
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,381
while the flames lick
at your feet.

505
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,208
You're afraid of this decision,

506
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,983
and you are trying to argue until
fate takes it out of your hands.

507
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:30,293
You're taking
the cowardly way out.

508
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,723
And worse

509
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:38,063
you're too cowardly to even admit
you're taking the cowardly way out.

510
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,565
You're right.

511
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,506
But I can change.

512
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:06,213
He could have gotten out.

513
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,648
People are found sometimes.

514
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,219
Even in collapsed...

515
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,492
I think they're
pulling a body out.

516
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:02,036
The coroner confirms ifs him.

517
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:23,222
House hired me when
no one else would.

518
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:25,827
He got me fired.

519
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:28,333
He gave me the guts
to get fired.

520
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,571
He gave me the courage to quit.

521
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:32,066
Gregory was...

522
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,134
He was a good son.

523
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,144
He was a trying
boyfriend, but I

524
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,085
never stopped loving him.

525
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,417
<i>He was my husband for real.</i>

526
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,661
I couldn't help but love him.

527
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:54,922
<i>He was my boss</i>

528
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,991
and my employee.

529
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,429
At both times,

530
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:04,763
I learned from him.

531
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,272
He made me a better parent,

532
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,340
whether he meant to or not.

533
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:10,777
He was willing to kill me.

534
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,615
And I'll always be grateful.

535
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,783
He wasn't always easy
to deal with...

536
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:20,023
<i>but somewhere in there,</i>

537
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,859
he knew how to love.

538
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,625
He was my friend.

539
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:39,637
The thing you have to remember,

540
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:42,035
the thing you can't forget,

541
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,579
is that Gregory House
saved lives.

542
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:51,652
He was a healer,
and in the end...

543
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,563
House was an ass.

544
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:08,998
He mocked anyone.

545
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,900
Patients, co-workers,
his dwindling friends,

546
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:15,603
anyone who didn't measure up to
his insane ideals of integrity.

547
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:18,338
He claimed to be on some
heroic quest for truth.

548
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,780
But the truth is
he was a bitter jerk

549
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,351
who liked making
people miserable.

550
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:25,681
And he proved that
by dying selfishly,

551
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:28,347
numbed by narcotics, without
a thought of anyone.

552
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,259
A betrayal of everyone who cared about him.

553
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,287
Phone.

554
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,065
A million times he needed me

555
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,604
and the onetime that I needed...

556
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,603
Oh, come on!
This is a funeral.

557
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,374
Just get it.

558
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,984
This is embarrassing.

559
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,814
I'd sworn I'd turned this off.

560
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:05,225
This isn't my phone.

561
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:38,485
Hi.

562
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,255
How...

563
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,767
I got out of the back
of the building.

564
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,100
The body...

565
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,611
Just switched
the dental records.

566
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,619
You're destroying
your entire life.

567
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:09,122
You can't go back from this.

568
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,687
You'll go to jail for years.

569
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,389
You can never be
a doctor again.

570
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:20,959
I'm dead, Wilson.

571
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,635
How do you want to spend
your last five months?

572
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:00,529
When the cancer starts
getting really bad...

573
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:04,833
Cancer's boring.
