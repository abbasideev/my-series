1
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:08,878
Let's get back to
Phil and Diane.

2
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,017
Phil's been having a
hard time finding work,

3
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:14,615
and Diane wants him to talk to her
about his fear, his disappointment.

4
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:19,561
And Phil wants Diane to trust him,
that they'll get through this,

5
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,964
ideally without having to
keep discussing feelings.

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,499
Not your exact words,
but am I wrong?

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,168
And most guys out there
are the same way.

8
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:34,577
But, ladies, if you're feeling
frustrated, remember,

9
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:35,874
it's not our fault.

10
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:40,045
We were raised to be
strong, not emotional,

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,378
to deny vulnerability,
not embrace it.

12
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,753
And you know
what that makes us?

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,153
Dinosaurs.

14
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:51,395
Nobody needs us to hunt
wild animals for food.

15
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,692
Nobody needs us to cut down
trees to build shelter.

16
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,558
They need us to evolve.

17
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,236
To catch up.

18
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:05,442
Since the 1960s, women's roles
have shifted radically.

19
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,076
And as their
roles have changed,

20
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,913
so have women.

21
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,578
Well, they've become tougher,

22
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:19,283
more demanding of us,
their partners.

23
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,053
And who can blame them?
Who can...

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,361
Who can...

25
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,787
For expecting us to

26
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,590
do the...

27
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:32,799
Joe!

28
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,731
Joe. Joe.

29
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,443
We need an ambulance.

30
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,610
You want?
I'm good.

31
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,485
Your limp's almost gone.

32
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,952
It pains me to interrupt
the collegial banter.

33
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,279
It pains me even more
to listen to it continue.

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,088
38-year-old man spikes a fever and
collapses during a speaking engagement.

35
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,755
ER checks out blood volume,

36
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,766
cardiac function and autonomic reflexes.
All normal.

37
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,598
Our patient makes a living telling
men to behave more like women.

38
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,367
Surprised you didn't throw psych
symptoms into the differential.

39
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,304
Either way, could be
a cerebral AVM.

40
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,843
ER did a head CT,
no sign of AVM.

41
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:46,967
Decent thought, though.

42
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,106
The patient's philosophy
makes perfect sense.

43
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,780
Its only flaw is
that it's impossible.

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,453
Evolution doesn't work that way.
You can't talk legs onto a fish.

45
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,385
If we're gonna go extinct,
we're gonna do it

46
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,822
drinking scotch and
driving muscle cars.

47
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,121
Am I right?

48
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:05,955
Am I... Thank you.

49
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,167
- Cephalic fibromuscular dysplasia?
- Doesn't explain the fever.

50
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,032
The patient's talking
about compromise.

51
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,504
If you don't think that's possible, you
don't think relationships are possible.

52
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,701
Anyone in this room in a
position to disprove that?

53
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,868
This guy's just playing
to his audience.

54
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,970
Women are by far the biggest
consumers of the self-help industry.

55
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,481
He could have a
pulmonary embolism.

56
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,348
Clot in his lung increases
right ventricular afterload,

57
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,681
drops the blood
flow to his brain.

58
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,153
We should do a
pulmonary angiogram.

59
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,247
Patient lacks major
risk factors for a PE.

60
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,552
Doesn't rule it out,
just makes it unlikely.

61
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,661
- Maybe we start with a D-dimer?
- Less invasive than the angiogram.

62
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,753
Good idea.

63
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,023
Fine.

64
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,495
Now, I am hereby searching
for a number two.

65
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,366
Which is why I'm
eating a lot of bran.

66
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,239
Also, I want a team leader, someone
to fill Foreman's old job.

67
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,275
Why?
You're right.

68
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:02,285
We don't need any more structure. It's
not like we had a near-fatal stabbing.

69
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:11,092
Well, if it isn't the
old ball and Ukraine.

70
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,421
Who's that?

71
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,528
His wife.

72
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,195
Dominika.

73
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,263
House, you survived prison.

74
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,433
And you Atlantic City.

75
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:28,775
Where they also had gangs and pruno,
but slightly less recidivism.

76
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,281
I start Ukrainian food
truck business.

77
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:35,444
After gambling' win, lose,
everybody likes a little knish.

78
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,612
You're here

79
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,417
and I seem to remember
throwing out a bunch of

80
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,822
certified letters
from Immigration.

81
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,119
I'm assuming
there's a connection.

82
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,126
Our green card interview
is in four days.

83
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:47,790
They come to the apartment. They
ask questions about marriage,

84
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:51,995
vacations, family history, what
side of the bed each sleep on.

85
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:57,068
We've never taken a vacation, I
don't like your family, and on top.

86
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,907
I hear Kiev is lovely
at this time of year.

87
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,913
And your mother, who may or may not
be dead for all I know, misses you.

88
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:08,077
Can it be that genius doctor is afraid to
take on a silly government apparatchik?

89
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,924
I would say more not interested
than afraid but why quibble?

90
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,015
Then I go to plan B.

91
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,764
Make you an offer that
cannot be refused.

92
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,426
How long have you
been doing seminars?

93
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,333
The marriage counseling, just
the past couple of years.

94
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,167
Before that I did
corporate coaching.

95
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,105
Can't imagine the same
advice works for both audiences.

96
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,934
Guess you shifted
with the market.

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,503
There's nothing cynical about my husband.
He and I...

98
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:37,707
It's okay. I get it.

99
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,846
What guy thinks men should
be more like women?

100
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,451
A macho jerk who got a big wake-up
call courtesy of three drunks

101
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,184
who beat the crap out of me outside
a sports bar in Milwaukee.

102
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,193
I'm guessing that explains the broken
wrist in your medical history.

103
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,856
Those morons did me the
biggest favor of my life.

104
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,127
I realized I'd
sacrificed my health

105
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,966
because I couldn't back down
from an argument over football.

106
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,796
Meeting Marlene was the
final piece in the puzzle.

107
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,207
She changed my career, my diet.

108
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,300
She gave me a whole
new direction in life.

109
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:13,407
We'll need to know exactly how
you changed your diet and when.

110
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,217
Need my apartment key back.

111
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,053
If you're breaking up with me, can
we at least talk about it first?

112
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,650
Maybe if you weren't
all nag and no shag...

113
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,226
I don't sleep with married men.

114
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,165
I'll get a copy made. You're an ex-con.
If you get caught

115
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:35,001
perjuring yourself to Homeland
Security, you'll end up back in jail.

116
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,406
That'd be troubling if there was the
slightest chance that we'd get caught.

117
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,842
You barely know each other and
you've got about five minutes

118
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,404
to remake yourselves into a
convincing married couple.

119
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,414
And Why?

120
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,509
Dominika gets her green card.
What's in this for you?

121
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,522
This is what men do for the
women they pretend to love.

122
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,522
Also she's paying me
30,000 bucks once we pass.

123
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,095
Apparently, knishes
sell like hotcakes.

124
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,686
Lab results.

125
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,595
Afraid you're gonna have
to finish your nag later.

126
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,600
I said I think it's
stupid, right?

127
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,971
Then I think I'm done.

128
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,373
D-dimer came back normal.
Rules out pulmonary embolism.

129
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,209
And our patient's a true believer
about the follies of masculinity.

130
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:19,045
He underwent a spiritual
overhaul three years ago.

131
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,777
He also went off gluten
and red meat.

132
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,286
Unfortunately' that doesn't
explain any of his symptoms.

133
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,447
One of those points
is not absurd.

134
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,785
What's absurd about
a change of heart?

135
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,383
What this guy believes is
making him a better person.

136
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,224
He's going against
his baser instincts.

137
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,127
Base, meaning foundational,

138
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,063
meaning things we're
biologically programmed to do.

139
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:40,571
Yeah, it's perfectly natural that
he stopped doing that stuff.

140
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,403
That's the kind of lapse that could take
you out of the running for team leader.

141
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,068
I feel surprisingly
okay with that.

142
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,139
It comes with a
50 buck-a-week raise.

143
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,511
I'm in.

144
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,920
You don't want to do that. You might
need your dignity later in life.

145
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,650
You didn't.

146
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,315
And she could be on her way
to living the dream

147
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,758
unless the rest of you
nut up and give her...

148
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,999
This spiritual overhaul.

149
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,434
Did it come after a
physical overhaul?

150
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,335
A major injury of some kind?

151
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,428
Bar fight.

152
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:19,670
But there's no way a broken wrist explains...
Adams, come with me.

153
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,837
You, too.

154
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:25,109
You guys get a
copy of that made.

155
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,056
Did those dudes bend your
ball-sack like Beckham?

156
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,359
Three years ago.
The bar fight.

157
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,952
This is Dr. House.
He has a theory.

158
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,023
Dr. Adams,
would you mind?

159
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,400
I asked you a question.
I assume you know the answer.

160
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,976
Yeah. I took a couple of
serious knees to the groin.

161
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,206
But what."

162
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,043
What has gotten into me?

163
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,884
Dr. Chase.

164
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,480
Just pick it up.

165
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,814
Do you know what's
wrong with me?

166
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:12,597
<i>Nothing that the Golden Girls couldn't
have handled in 23 hilarious minutes.</i>

167
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,323
You had a hot flash.

168
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:18,433
Those guys kicked your guys hard
enough to do lasting damage.

169
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:23,164
You didn't even look when presented
with two reasonably attractive tuchi.

170
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,072
Yeah, I said it.

171
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,508
I was listening to my doctor.

172
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,070
People generally listen with their ears,
leaving their eyes free to wander.

173
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,749
I'm guessing that your testosterone
level is just below Bieber.

174
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,851
Do a blood test to confirm,
then start hormone replacement.

175
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,351
It's no wonder that you
think women are so great.

176
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,756
You've basically been one
for the last three years.

177
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,926
Tests confirmed
House was right.

178
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,863
Low testosterone explains
all your symptoms.

179
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,094
They should go away
with replacement therapy.

180
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,932
We're gonna give you
a fairly high dose.

181
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,028
Over time, your personal physician
may reduce it a little.

182
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,198
Just need you to turn around.

183
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,366
Will the shots increase
his libido?

184
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,605
Are you worried about that?

185
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:02,975
No.

186
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:10,048
Have you been unsatisfied?
No. No, it's just...

187
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,453
It's usually me that
initiates things.

188
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:18,056
Sometimes I think maybe you
aren't that attracted to me.

189
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,255
Are you crazy?

190
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:23,633
With these injections, you will
see an increase in sex drive.

191
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:24,929
Great.
Yeah.

192
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,244
All done.
Okay.

193
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,245
Something's wrong.

194
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,610
I think I peed myself.

195
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,085
Is that from the testosterone?

196
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:48,023
Couldn't be. I don't think
you're going home just yet.

197
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,262
It's not a plumbing problem.
Means it's probably neurological.

198
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,766
And?

199
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:02,301
And name Dominika's
three brothers.

200
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:09,641
Volodymyr, Oleksiy and...

201
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,944
The low testosterone is off
the table as a symptom.

202
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:18,317
Guy got his nuts cracked three years ago.
Don't need to look much further than that.

203
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,788
So his hose just happens
to spring a leak

204
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,625
at the same time he's in the hospital
for a totally unrelated problem'?

205
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,857
- Fjodor.
- It's Fedir.

206
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:31,060
If low testosterone means I can't
get sick with something else,

207
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,137
then punch me in
the junk right now.

208
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,536
I would if it
weren't redundant.

209
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,904
Is Fedir the one
who married Mykola?

210
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:41,740
Mykola is Dominika's uncle.

211
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,872
How is it you can retain every detail
of our habits and personal lives

212
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,814
and none of this?

213
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,546
I find it hard to remember things
I don't give a crap about.

214
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,589
Ergo, Dominika has one
brother, and his name is Al.

215
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,354
Maybe the testicular damage set
the stage for something worse.

216
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:00,487
Multiple sclerosis causes incontinence
and progresses faster in men with low T.

217
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:01,657
Way to stay on point.

218
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,830
It's that kind of leadership that's
putting you at the head of the pack.

219
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,165
There is no pack.
She's the only applicant.

220
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,899
Well, that's settled, then.

221
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,840
Have your underlings do an LP

222
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:16,607
and get a cranio-spinal MRI to check
for plaques associated with MS.

223
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:20,048
I will go tell Foreman
about your promotion.

224
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,413
Wait.
Wait.

225
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,187
So nobody cares
about the job until I apply

226
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,456
and suddenly it's the last limited
edition lightsaber at Comicon?

227
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,861
Just seems like ii should go to
someone with more seniority.

228
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,955
Meaning you.

229
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,533
I said more, not most.

230
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,125
Meaning you or Taub.

231
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,797
House is a dictator. Second-in-command
is a meaningless position.

232
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,567
Doesn't look meaningless
on my resume.

233
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,733
It doesn't have to be
meaningless at all.

234
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,311
The right person
could turn it into something,

235
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,108
get the department
running smoothly.

236
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,240
I wonder who that right
person could be.

237
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:53,976
House is the head
of the department.

238
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,384
It's only fair that a woman should
hold the other position of authority.

239
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,788
Yeah, let's go affirmative action on
this, because then I'll definitely win.

240
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,124
This is what House wants. Wind us up and
watch us fight over an empty title.

241
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:09,428
Which would make us extra stupid because
of what we've just been through.

242
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:13,264
We should let him choose
whoever he wants and move on.

243
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:20,135
So if these proteins are in my
spinal fluid, that means I have MS.

244
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:23,237
The proteins may indicate MS.
There's no one definitive test.

245
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,647
That's why Dr. House
ordered an MRI as well.

246
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,747
This is anaesthetic.

247
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,778
It's a scary diagnosis,

248
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,322
but advances are being made.

249
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,292
Several drugs approved
just this year.

250
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,521
To be honest, at the moment I'm
feeling a little more worried

251
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,291
about the
testosterone injections.

252
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,366
It's making me feel different

253
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:43,991
Kind of amped.

254
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:50,172
I went through this big life change,
and it felt really meaningful,

255
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,673
but what if it was
all just chemistry?

256
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,382
Loss of testosterone
could have been a factor.

257
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,315
<i>But think of it as a catalyst</i>

258
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,044
It got you to re-evaluate.
Now you know what's important.

259
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,623
You can choose to
hold on to that.

260
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,953
Right?

261
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,321
Certainly worth trying.

262
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,462
Deep breath, stay very still.

263
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,396
Just tell House to drop the
whole team leader thing.

264
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:19,993
That's the only way
it'll go away.

265
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,037
I don't think ifs
such a bad idea.

266
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,640
A little more structure in
your department couldn't hurt.

267
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,342
Yeah, House is doing this because
of his great love of structure,

268
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,905
not because he wants us
to turn on each other.

269
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,745
So, don't do that.

270
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:39,186
It makes sense to have someone in there
with a little more accountability.

271
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,384
As long as it's not Adams.

272
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:45,827
She sees the whole thing as an opportunity
to remake the department in her image.

273
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,195
Or Park, for obvious reasons.

274
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:53,094
And Taub's got the kids.
He's pretty busy.

275
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,833
Are you seriously angling for
a job that you mocked as fake

276
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,206
the whole time I had it?
I don't want the job.

277
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,740
You just don't want
anyone else to have it.

278
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,006
This'll be great.

279
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,081
Your grandmother
is kind of sexy.

280
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,382
This is Taras Shevchenko,
the greatest Ukrainian poet.

281
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,387
<i>Is he the guy behind There Once
Was a Man From Kremenchuk?</i>

282
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,892
Help me move coffee table.

283
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,602
Well, then, where
will we have coffee?

284
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,431
And by coffee, I mean scotch.

285
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:30,474
Coffee and booze are artificial high.
For me, high is in exercise.

286
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:46,255
Dance-aerobics. Fun and
good for the butt.

287
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,093
Amy Grant?

288
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:02,930
I know, but there's a hot girl jumping
up and down in my living room, so...

289
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,467
Aww!

290
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:13,406
You have a limited amount of time to
learn a ton of uninteresting facts.

291
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,578
Welcome to my wheelhouse.

292
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,512
You brought a protractor?

293
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:21,357
You never know when you might
need to make a pie chart.

294
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:27,489
Looks like someone is currying favor
for the team leader position.

295
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:28,822
Yes.

296
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:33,995
We'll be using a basic alphabet
technique with a mnemonic multiplier.

297
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,772
In high school, they called
me the Bookie Monster.

298
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:39,641
Pop quiz.

299
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,770
Where did you get
the candlesticks'?

300
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,371
On three. One, two, three.

301
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,505
Morocco.
Denver.

302
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:55,292
Drink up. It's gonna
be a long night.

303
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,056
You really think this guy's gonna
Hulk out once the hormones kick in?

304
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:05,363
Some male lizards do
push-ups to attract mates.

305
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,131
When scientists gave them
extra testosterone,

306
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,831
they did push-ups
until they died.

307
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:11,039
Same drive you
took advantage of

308
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,974
to get Chase to carry a box of
files down to your car yesterday.

309
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,644
Periventricular and subcortical
white matter are clean.

310
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:23,676
So you're saying masculinity
is ingrained and irrational.

311
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,148
I'm saying it's
pointless to try...

312
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:30,217
By extension, you're also saying
femininity is enlightened and rational.

313
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,195
It's the way we should all be.
Guys just aren't capable of it.

314
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,332
Brain stem and cord are clean.

315
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,067
<i>Is it okay if I
scratch my nose?</i>

316
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:44,833
Go ahead.

317
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,701
I guess he doesn't have MS.

318
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:48,939
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

319
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,279
Is it your hand?
No, it's my eyes.

320
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,248
I'm seeing double.

321
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,419
Smile. It's your
honeymoon.

322
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:16,806
So, what causes double vision on
top of all the other symptoms?

323
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,206
It's not a brain tumor or we
would've seen it on the scans.

324
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,469
Eye exam didn't offer
anything conclusive.

325
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:22,905
Let's do some winter shots.

326
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,270
Wardrobe change.

327
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,543
Thyroid eye disease in
conjunction with Graves.

328
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,051
Thyroid level's normal.

329
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,748
Check it out.

330
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:34,988
Simpson traded this in exchange for me
helping out on some of my days off.

331
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,287
Quite the display of
initiative and leadership.

332
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:42,457
But you're way too smart to fall
for a blatant bribe like that.

333
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,729
Or a blatant flaunting
of cleavage like those.

334
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,636
What happened to not
letting House get to you?

335
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:52,904
You're like lemmings marching off the
cliff of competitive humiliation.

336
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,808
All I'm doing is my job.

337
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,244
House has indicated that he
considers me attractive.

338
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,475
There's nothing wrong with me using
my strengths to my advantage.

339
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:04,578
With an argument like that, maybe you
should just drop down to your knees and...

340
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,590
I mean, unless that's
not your strength.

341
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,684
Big hug, big man.
It's cold out here'

342
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,829
At the risk of derailing this
very productive photo shoot

343
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,832
and bickering session,

344
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,596
what about myesthenia gravis?

345
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,934
Extra-ocular muscle weakness
leads to double vision,

346
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,339
atonic bladder leads
to incontinence.

347
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:28,435
Could've been triggered
when his T got really low.

348
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,282
Ooh, little one.
He'd be a good pick.

349
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:35,946
Smooth.

350
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,351
You let the rest
of them compete,

351
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,457
tear each other to pieces, then
you swoop in with the save.

352
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,687
Start the patient on MG
and plasmapheresis.

353
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,456
Can you handle that, please?

354
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,960
- I need a minute.
- Make it quick.

355
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,791
We're due in Memphis.

356
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:01,305
You think you want this,
but it's a bad idea.

357
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,313
I was gonna go Dollywood, but I'm
not sure I can pull off that wig.

358
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,976
Everybody was playing nice and in
your world, nice doesn't solve cases.

359
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,990
But after what happened, a
little bonding is a good thing.

360
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,483
We still have ideas,
we still argue.

361
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,395
Maybe it could work better
if we appreciate each other.

362
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:25,401
That's impressive. You said that whole
thing without once moving your lips.

363
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,494
The ones you're not moving.

364
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,341
I get it. I won't play along
with your stupid games,

365
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,573
so I'm no longer
a man. Clever.

366
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,048
Actually, you won't play along
with my stupid games

367
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,708
because you're no longer a man.

368
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:45,351
Still clever, though. Studies
have shown that raising kids

369
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,856
lowers testosterone
levels in men.

370
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,790
The more involved you are,
the lower it gets.

371
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,024
Right, having kids
has neutered me.

372
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:57,867
Or maybe it's helped
me finally grow up.

373
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,308
How are you feeling?

374
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:08,640
As long as I keep my eyes
closed, pretty good.

375
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:12,272
Really good, actually.
I've got energy,

376
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,648
I feel confident, clear.

377
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:18,221
Testosterone does tend
to perk you up.

378
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,883
Hey, hon, I brought you a burger.
Really?

379
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:24,086
You're in the hospital.
Eat whatever you want.

380
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,220
You are the best wife ever.

381
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:32,064
I'm not just saying that because of how
great your ass looks in those jeans.

382
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:33,637
I'm sorry, that was a little...

383
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,226
No, it's okay.

384
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,833
A girl likes to know she's appreciated.
Come here.

385
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:44,805
So, I think we should talk to Leading
Lights about seminars and DVDs.

386
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,407
You sure? You were worried
about the commitment.

387
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,747
Yeah, there's no point being
in business with them halfway.

388
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:52,678
You okay with that?

389
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:55,520
It's good to finally
have a decision.

390
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:57,185
Okay.

391
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:02,459
Fedir is the brother
she worries about the most,

392
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,590
ever since Luba passed.

393
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,929
Sorry, this was the closest we could
find to the cold, soulless offices

394
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,497
of a government bureaucracy.

395
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:13,599
If you're not using
your office, I will.

396
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,771
Does Dominika still communicate
with her high school friends?

397
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:21,615
Vasyly, yes, Oksana, no.
Not since she kissed Paulo.

398
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,883
'Cause that bitch knew
that Dominika liked him.

399
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,954
- Wrong.
- Oksana is a slut, dead to me.

400
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,962
The right answer is
the wrong answer.

401
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,465
No husband would pay that much
attention to his wife's friend dramas.

402
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,468
Haven't you been
divorced three times?

403
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,706
In between those divorces,
I was married,

404
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,299
non-fraudulently,

405
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,637
for 12 years total,

406
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,805
which is 12 years longer
than anyone in this room.

407
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,078
Move.

408
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,387
So are you going for this
team leader thing?

409
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,486
Probably.

410
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:11,159
You deserve it. You have way
more experience than me.

411
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,395
You're giving LIP?

412
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,734
I wish. I still have a lot
of med school debt.

413
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:18,832
And my parents need help
with their mortgage.

414
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,504
So, I could kind of
use the money.

415
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,106
As of an hour ago, I'm just
seeing one of everything.

416
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:30,243
Looks like you guys were right about...
We'll be right back.

417
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,681
"I could use the money"?

418
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,350
You want to game me, you've
gotta do better than that.

419
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,517
Chase...
You want to be a leader,

420
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,357
you have to know how to manipulate.
You can't just spill...

421
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,454
I think the whites of
his eyes were yellow.

422
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:50,696
Everything okay?

423
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,033
Jaundice.

424
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,372
There's something wrong
with your liver.

425
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,781
Liver function tests confirm his
enzymes are totally out of whack.

426
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,718
So much for myasthenia gravis.

427
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,882
Can we hurry this up'? I have a
government to defraud at noon.

428
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,453
If you need to leave,
you should.

429
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,960
I'm fairly confident
our patient's got sarcoidosis.

430
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:14,053
Wow, you said that with
so much authority.

431
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:15,725
Did anyone else get chills?

432
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,768
Just until I realized
our patient has

433
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,894
no sign of parenchymal
lung abnormalities,

434
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,767
which makes sarcoidosis
a long shot.

435
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,433
And bookkeeping isn't gonna get
you any farther than the boobs.

436
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:27,644
Though in fairness, the boobs
were really, really helping.

437
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,337
I still think it's
myasthenia gravis.

438
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:32,109
Did you miss the recap? We treated
for that, the liver tanked.

439
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,310
But his vision got better.

440
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,180
The liver problems could
be a sign of celiac.

441
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:39,186
He's been back on gluten since
he's been in the hospital.

442
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,313
Yesterday he had a burger.

443
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,983
That would've kicked his celiac into
gear, causing the liver problems.

444
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:46,919
So your theory is that he
has two unrelated diseases.

445
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,988
And he's already got
low testosterone.

446
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:52,194
I seem to remember something
about House hating coincidences.

447
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,326
It's true.

448
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,998
I think it's Lyme disease.
One single disease named Lyme.

449
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,164
Without a rash?

450
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,970
10% of cases present
without a rash.

451
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:06,008
Lyme disease it is. Start
the patient on antibiotics.

452
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:10,715
I have to get home before my
fake wife gets real annoyed.

453
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,455
Something bothering you?

454
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,656
I asked the nurse for an extra pillow.
That was half an hour ago.

455
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,699
Sorry, things can
get pretty hectic.

456
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:25,496
It's a pillow. I mean,
how hard can a pillow...

457
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,472
Listen to me, I'm being a jerk.

458
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,739
Testosterone can give you a shorter
temper even when you're not sick.

459
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,006
You noticed and adjusted.
That's a good thing.

460
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,177
Hey.

461
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,310
Just got a call
from our lawyer.

462
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,150
You changed our counter
to Leading Lights?

463
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,248
You deserve proper billing and a
salary bump in the second term.

464
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:51,851
We talked about this. We decided it wasn't
worth potentially blowing the deal.

465
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,487
It'll be fine.

466
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,097
I've got to get some work done.

467
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:08,038
These are such pretty
flowers you buy for me.

468
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,747
Every Friday from
Japanese florist,

469
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:14,841
on corner of Edison and Conway.
There's just one more thing.

470
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:18,582
With this ring,

471
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,286
I thee wedded.

472
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,455
You left it here when you skipped
town with your boyfriend.

473
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,564
You kept the rings?

474
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,567
Actually, I tried to trade them to
a hooker for unspecified favors.

475
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,103
But it turns out she
doesn't accept zinc.

476
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,866
Like modern fairy tale.

477
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:50,784
Dr. and Mrs. Gregory House?
Yeah.

478
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:53,288
Nate Weinmann,
U.S. Immigration.

479
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,225
Welcome to our home.

480
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,633
Give him time.

481
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,504
When I was 14, there was a
girl I wanted to impress.

482
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:20,243
So I jumped off the roof of her house.
Broke my ankle.

483
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,917
Joe's basically going
through puberty.

484
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,320
It'll take him a
while to adjust.

485
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:33,859
I tracked down a video from one of
Joe's business coaching seminars

486
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,432
from before I knew him.

487
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:39,662
<i>I'm hearing a
lot about the value of compromise.</i>

488
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,932
<i>But we don'! live on Sesame Street.
We live in the real world,</i>

489
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,134
<i>the business world.</i>

490
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,543
<i>If you're not a winner,
you're a loser.</i>

491
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:50,872
<i>If you aren't comfortable
with that,</i>

492
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,674
<i>go open a pottery studio.</i>

493
00:27:56,341 --> 00:28:00,016
I never would have gone out
with the guy in this video.

494
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,953
Do you remember the last
time she visited Vasyl?

495
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,534
Uh... Let me see.
That would be August?

496
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,231
No, no, July.

497
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:19,309
I remember. It was right
after our half anniversary

498
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,810
and I forgot to put
a gift in her suitcase.

499
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,643
And I never heard
the end of that one.

500
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,211
House specialty.

501
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,648
I made up this pun.

502
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,525
Thank you.

503
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,721
Honey, why do you do this to me?
You know I'm watching my weight.

504
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:45,427
Then maybe you stop eating cheese in front
of open fridge in middle of the night.

505
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:49,002
- This is delicious.
- Thank you.

506
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:52,335
So, everything looks
good in here.

507
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,345
I'm just gonna step out and
get a corroborating interview

508
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,177
from one of the neighbors.
Neighbors?

509
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:03,710
It's middle of the day,
I think everybody is at work.

510
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,788
Yeah, then they're at work. I
just got a form to check off,

511
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:09,188
and you will be on your
way to permanent status.

512
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:22,735
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a minute?

513
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:24,306
How can I help you?

514
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:26,603
Do you know
Dr. and Mrs. House?

515
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,406
Of course. They've been my
neighbors about two years now.

516
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,536
Lovely couple.

517
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,042
I see them almost every night.

518
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,414
They seem always
to be together.

519
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,111
Great. Thanks for your help.

520
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,244
Cheerio.

521
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:41,380
Hey' what are you doing?
That's my door.

522
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:48,388
Handing out menus for
a new Chinese place.

523
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:55,801
You're that guy that plays noisy video
games with House on Saturday nights.

524
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:06,910
There's a simple explanation.

525
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,283
Be at my office
tomorrow at 10:00.

526
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,103
The patient's shown
zero improvement.

527
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,332
Because he's only been
on the antibiotics overnight.

528
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,704
Or because he doesn't
have Lyme disease.

529
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,605
Where are you? HOUSE: Just chilling

530
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,542
<i>at U. S. Citizenship
and Immigration,</i>

531
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:38,274
<i>waiting on my fraud interview
with my wife and my attorney.</i>

532
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,173
No big.
House.

533
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,782
Hang HP...

534
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:46,179
I still think it's myasthenia
gravis plus celiac.

535
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:48,155
His change in diet
has to be significant.

536
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,487
We just need to do an
intestinal biopsy to confirm.

537
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:54,028
With his low platelet count a biopsy
puts him at risk for an abdominal bleed,

538
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,689
which puts him
at risk of death.

539
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,130
Either you're done or you're
walking in there without a lawyer.

540
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,036
I know, it sounds like a phone,

541
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:12,741
but it's a timer. To remind
me to pee before our meeting.

542
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:20,581
Hello, old chap.

543
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,314
You need to save yourself.

544
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:25,325
<i>I was up last night, trying to
find another angle, but I can't.</i>

545
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,987
Tell Immigration you were
in love with Dominika,

546
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:31,158
but your marriage fell apart And that's
why you haven't been living together.

547
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,932
She'll be deported.
Permanently.

548
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:39,532
House, I know you like Dominika, you
have fun with her, but you got caught.

549
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,166
There's no getting out of this.

550
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:46,047
<i>The best you can hope for is
that you don't go back to jail.</i>

551
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:54,057
Tell my team to skip the biopsy and
give the antibiotics more time.

552
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:57,625
They're ready for us.

553
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:04,131
I drew a line in the sand and I won.
We should be celebrating.

554
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,534
Do you need a few minutes? I'd
rather keep getting better.

555
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:09,037
That's just ii.

556
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:12,233
You won. You made a demand that
could have blown up the deal

557
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:15,641
and you never even asked me. The
deal didn't blow up, they caved.

558
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:19,739
Joe, you say it in your seminars. Process
matters just as much as results.

559
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:24,411
Are you seriously busting my chops because
I made one little move without you'?

560
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:26,045
How about stepping aside

561
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:29,489
and letting me be the man in
this relationship for a change?

562
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,892
I really can't talk
to you right now.

563
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,402
I don't know why I said that.

564
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,503
Just, I got so angry.

565
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,175
Hopefully after this dose,

566
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,839
you'll start to feel better
and we can get you home.

567
00:32:57,843 --> 00:33:00,619
But I'd like to do
one more test.

568
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,993
The testimony of one angry,
near-sighted neighbor

569
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,255
shouldn't outweigh all other evidence.
Photos, utility bills...

570
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,831
Yes. Because your clients
would never fake anything.

571
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,493
We acknowledge the neighbor thing was
a mistake, but that doesn't mean

572
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,798
that all the other documentation
should just be thrown out.

573
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:18,703
Look, look, I get that it's your job to act
like there's a case here, but shut up.

574
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:26,347
USCIS will be denying Ms. Patrova's
green card application.

575
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:29,385
You'll be referred to Immigration
Court for deportation proceedings.

576
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,944
And we're gonna inform your parole
officer about evidence of fraud.

577
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:36,489
So, unless anybody has
anything else to add...

578
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,967
Please, I am begging,
do not send him back to jail.

579
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,536
Maybe we have not lived
together all these months...

580
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:50,470
Mrs. House, I have to
advise you not to continue.

581
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:53,701
This man and I,
did we marry for love?

582
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:58,679
No. But this past week,
we have a lot of fun,

583
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,682
working really hard to fool
U.S. government. Right?

584
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,013
Don't answer that.
Way ahead of you.

585
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,144
<i>It was fake,</i>

586
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:08,889
but it felt real.

587
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,358
Maybe because it become real.

588
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:14,497
This man.

589
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:16,989
My husband.

590
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:22,862
I want to stay with him, but if I cannot,
please send me away and let him be free.

591
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:28,034
I love him.

592
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,453
I didn't buy a word you said.

593
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:51,959
But a judge might.

594
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,308
I'm gonna let you stay.

595
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:07,549
But for the next six months, I'm
gonna hold on to this file.

596
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,086
And our investigators are gonna show up
unannounced at 6:00 a.m., 11:00 at night,

597
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:13,155
and they better find the two
of you sitting on the couch,

598
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:16,885
watching NCIS, eating ice
cream from the same spoon.

599
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:22,421
Or both of you will be sent to places
far less pleasant than New Jersey.

600
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,445
What you just said in there...

601
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:47,819
Don't worry. lam much too smart
to be falling in love with you.

602
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:51,018
I will be needing extra
shelf in bathroom.

603
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:04,335
Abdominal biopsy showed flattened villi.
Looks like you were right about celiac.

604
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:08,969
You do remember Chase got stabbed
doing a test House didn't order.

605
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,478
Good comparison, since both
patients were tweaked on steroids.

606
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:15,210
You only did this to score
points over Chase and Park.

607
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,980
We were right. I proved it and
the patient didn't bleed out.

608
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,315
Why are you being
a jerk about this?

609
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:22,457
Let's go see if House is back.

610
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,226
Patient's having
trouble breathing.

611
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,293
So much for celiac.

612
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,032
His breathing is stabilized,

613
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:39,836
but his lung function is at
60% and his liver is tanking.

614
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,911
And he has major symptoms of celiac
without actually having celiac.

615
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,674
Could be Whipple's.

616
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:47,147
Doesn't explain
the incontinence.

617
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,149
Intestinal lymphoma?

618
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,311
Doesn't explain
the double vision.

619
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,685
Any time you want to jump in.

620
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,322
Is dance-aerobics
even a thing?

621
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:58,661
I hear it's good for the butt.

622
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,595
What about a
parasitic infection?

623
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,687
Strongyloides is known to
damage the small intestine...

624
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:05,324
In this country he's about as likely
to get that as win Powerball.

625
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,664
Someone does win Powerball.
Every week.

626
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:09,705
The patient went to Puerto
Rico a few months ago.

627
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:12,604
One of the few places in the U.S.
you can pick up strongyloides.

628
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:13,765
Treatment is ivermectin.

629
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:18,439
We give that to someone with liver problems,
he could have seizures, or worse.

630
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,382
Do it.

631
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,352
<i>I'm hearing a lot
about the value of compromise.</i>

632
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:37,858
<i>But we don'! live on Sesame Street.
We live in the real...</i>

633
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:43,703
I was wondering if maybe we
overlooked a symptom, or something.

634
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:49,702
Makes perfect sense if you're the
patient, and pantywaist is the symptom.

635
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:54,081
Adams and I both thought
the patient could have celiac,

636
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:58,984
but only she was willing to go out on
a limb and run the test. I gave up.

637
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:02,422
Now you're in here watching
a motivational speech.

638
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:05,987
Even your attempt to get
your balls back lacks balls.

639
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:09,224
<i>World, the business world.</i>

640
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,333
<i>If you're not a winner,
you're a loser.</i>

641
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,460
His voice, it's lower
than it is now.

642
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:17,563
If only there was a good reason for a
professional speaker to be hoarse.

643
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:19,933
<i>Go open a pottery studio.</i>

644
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,441
Good point.

645
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:27,345
It's not a good point.
It's a decent point.

646
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,941
You're doing it again.

647
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:33,112
You got any other videos,
other seminars? A couple.

648
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:36,817
<i>When you see a weakness,
that's a time for strength.</i>

649
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:40,260
<i>A lot of people say, "I feel bad about it.
" The other guy made a mistake...</i>

650
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,456
You bailed too early.

651
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:44,430
Now I get all the credit.

652
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:46,763
<i>That kind of thinking is
what makes you...</i>

653
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:55,936
Chronic hoarseness is a symptom of a
condition called silent thyroiditis.

654
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,372
But I'm not hoarse.

655
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,779
Exactly. But you were,
three years ago.

656
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:03,509
Silent thyroiditis
comes and goes.

657
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:05,383
And it, in turn, is a symptom

658
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:09,049
of Polyglandular Autoimmune
syndrome, type 3.

659
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:11,957
Which makes this
is a really bad idea.

660
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:19,230
PAS-3 attacks the body's
own endocrine system,

661
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,733
moving from gland to gland.

662
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:22,494
<i>It started in the
thyroid, then,</i>

663
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:24,971
<i>probably helped along
by your low testosterone,</i>

664
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,708
<i>moved on to the gut. TAUB: Where
it caused celiac disease,</i>

665
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,801
or it would've, if you weren't
on a gluten-free diet.

666
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:32,012
I was right.

667
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,809
This is incredibly relevant.

668
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,479
Eventually PAS-3
attacked your thymus gland.

669
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,852
You developed myasthenia gravis,
which landed you in here.

670
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:44,085
Then you started eating gluten,
which only made things worse.

671
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:45,559
So, am I gonna be okay?

672
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,561
We'll treat the various conditions
with high-dose steroids.

673
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:50,496
Assuming they respond,
you'll be fine.

674
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,158
And the testosterone?

675
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,006
Kicked in the nuts is
kicked in the nuts.

676
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:08,010
Over the past week, you
have all had good moments and bad'

677
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:11,411
No one candidate has prevailed.

678
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:17,251
So now we embark upon
a contest of medical strength,

679
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:20,022
stamina and skill.

680
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:21,188
Can we just get this over with?

681
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:25,029
If the competitor representing Australia
would like to take a point deduction,

682
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:27,194
he should by all means
continue yapping.

683
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,697
Your glee is on the verge of making
this not worth it for any of us.

684
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:33,271
Can I at least light the torch?

685
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,133
Hurry.

686
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:46,617
I declare open the games of the
number one number two competition.

687
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:48,952
<i>Je déclare ouvert...</i>

688
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,553
All right.
Ready, set, suture!

689
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:01,895
T-time.

690
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,133
What happens if
I don't take it?

691
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,401
Or at least, go to a
much lower dose.

692
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:07,567
Are you having side effects?

693
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,076
No, I feel great.

694
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:10,578
Faster, clearer.

695
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:12,677
More like myself.

696
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,251
But my marriage and my career,

697
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:19,584
they're both built
on me being somebody else.

698
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:22,750
Low testosterone can cause
depression and problems sleeping.

699
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:27,024
It's also been linked to conditions
such as osteoporosis and diabetes.

700
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,830
It will make your life harder
and more dangerous,

701
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:32,492
on top of all the meds
you'll be taking.

702
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,671
I'll take that risk.

703
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:44,042
I'm a better man without it

704
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,534
Well, this certainly has brought
more structure to the department.

705
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:10,903
Really, I'm just excited
for the wheelchair race.

706
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,871
You were smart not to enter.

707
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:16,912
Never in, never lose.

708
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,579
And since you no
longer have stones...

709
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:23,480
I'll split the 50
a week with you.

710
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:25,548
Deal.

711
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,796
Honey, I'm home!
