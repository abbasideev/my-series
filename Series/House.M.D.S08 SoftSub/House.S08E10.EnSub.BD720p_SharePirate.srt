1
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:08,878
How long has your
daughter had trouble breathing?

2
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:11,220
About a week now.

3
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,183
The best dads wait two or more.

4
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,317
Yeah, no.
It's not like it's serious.

5
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,490
I checked online and it's
asthma or something.

6
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,500
"Or something" is
the number one killer

7
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,569
of teens with
no medical degree.

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,466
When was the last time
he took you to see a doctor?

9
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,234
Uh...
Like five months ago.

10
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,808
We went to a clinic in Trenton.
I had strep throat.

11
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,811
Remember the antibiotic they gave you?
Is it neomycin?

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,346
Amoxicillin.

13
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,577
So, about the inhaler
for my asthma, I was...

14
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:42,710
Sorry.

15
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,416
Hospital policy
specifically prohibits me

16
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,719
from giving meds
to unrelated homeless people

17
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:48,918
pretending to be
father and daughter.

18
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,063
Your pants are
a size too short,

19
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,392
so either you grew
several of inches

20
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,660
or you grabbed the closest
size in the thrift store.

21
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,225
And only you have dimples,
which are adorable,

22
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,430
but they're also an X-linked
dominant genetic trait.

23
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,568
Which actually
doesn't prove anything.

24
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,734
The fact that she didn't
burst into tears tells me

25
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,709
that you never thought
he was your dad.

26
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:09,672
Let's get out of here.

27
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,215
Since you're the brains of the operation,
you might want to stick around.

28
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,083
What, so I can get
busted by Social Services?

29
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:19,282
No. So you can stop
bleeding out of your ear.

30
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,861
It's usually a sign
of a skull fracture.

31
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:27,555
Someone been using your head
as a soccer ball?

32
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,897
No. As much as I'd like
to take your word for it,

33
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,133
I have no interest in
taking your word for it.

34
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,197
No tenderness. No pain.

35
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:38,634
Right. Looks like you're telling
the truth about something.

36
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,410
The ear canal is fine.

37
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,313
And you don't have a fever.

38
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,814
Pay the man. He's late
for a trashcan fire.

39
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,397
Would you tell me what's going on'?
What's wrong with me'?

40
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,165
I have no idea.

41
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,342
Why did you ask to meet us 30
miles away from the hospital?

42
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,444
Because I can.

43
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,884
Also, Chris Christie's
blog says

44
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,288
the pancakes here are the best.

45
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,794
So, what do we got
on this 18-year-old

46
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,488
with the ear bleed
and the breathing problems?

47
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:09,499
CT confirms no skull fracture. And
looking at her confirms she's not 18.

48
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,235
Yes, she is.
Says so in the file.

49
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,805
We can't treat an underage
patient without a guardian.

50
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,033
We need to call
Social Services.

51
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,973
I cut a deal with the patient.

52
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,867
We don't call,
she doesn't bolt.

53
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,072
Whatever age, living on the street
makes her vulnerable to malnutrition,

54
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,240
drug use, HIV...

55
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,543
All things which could
explain her symptoms.

56
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,054
No sign of malnutrition, lox screen's
clear, STD panel was negative

57
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,214
and is that Foreman?

58
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,885
Oh, my goodness, it is.

59
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,827
Hi, Dean Foreman!

60
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,709
Are you not gonna introduce us
because we're married?

61
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:55,838
No, wait, that's her.

62
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,906
She's a pharmaceutical rep, and
this is a working breakfast.

63
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,508
In a restaurant that's nowhere
near your home or the hospital'?

64
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,079
Chris Christie
recommends the pancakes.

65
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,127
Squamous cell middle ear tumor
could've caused the ear bleed,

66
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,027
paraneoplastic reaction caused
the breathing problems.

67
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,463
Middle ear looks
completely normal.

68
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,125
But there is thickening in the lining
of the wall of the third ventricle.

69
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,726
Could be a sign of
cerebral infection.

70
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,203
It would explain
the lack of fever.

71
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,900
Pneumococcus is pretty common
among the homeless population.

72
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,533
We should find out if
she's been vaccinated.

73
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,738
Sure. Ask her and when she
refuses to tell you anything,

74
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,407
start her on ceftriaxone
for pneumococcus.

75
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,711
And if she says she
has been vaccinated?

76
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,414
Then don't believe her and start her
on ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.

77
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,753
How about we don't believe she's gonna
bolt and we call Social Services.

78
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,121
While I'm in
the little boys' room,

79
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,558
you can pretend I'm seriously
considering that idea.

80
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:46,756
The bathroom's that way.

81
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,795
Pretty sure there's
one in the hospital.

82
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,169
When I was your age,
I ran away.

83
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,301
Lived on my own.

84
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:02,836
At the time, it seemed...

85
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,970
Let me guess,

86
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,314
life with mom and dad was kind
of a drag so you just ran away,

87
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,615
lived with friends
and partied with guys

88
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,985
that you knew your
parents would hate,

89
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,821
and then when you got tired of
being a rebel, you just went home.

90
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:21,422
Being homeless isn't
a vacation for me,

91
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,297
and I'm not acting out.

92
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,999
My life at home sucked, so I
got the hell out of there.

93
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,869
There are other options besides
living on the streets.

94
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,534
Right. Like group homes,
where you're packed in

95
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,511
with as many messed-up,
delinquent kids as possible,

96
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,843
foster parents, who only take you
in because you're a meal ticket.

97
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,714
I can think of easier ways
to make 175 bucks a week.

98
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,286
No, you're right.
I really should roll the dice

99
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,516
and hope for a pair that don't ruin
my life the way that my mom...

100
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,114
Get your hands off my stuff!

101
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,285
This stuff might tell us more
about why you're sick.

102
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,987
A history textbook?
You go to school?

103
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,861
I don't plan on being
homeless forever.

104
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,361
Hello, good sir.

105
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,465
My brother the general here gots
the green apple quick step.

106
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,072
One of us is in
the wrong time zone.

107
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,243
And if it's me, I need
to talk to a stockbroker

108
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:17,914
and anyone from the Kennedy family.
In that order.

109
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,649
He got the runs
and we do need him

110
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,417
up and at 'em for
battle tomorrow.

111
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,927
It's hardly authentic,
coming to a newfangled clinic,

112
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,759
especially with
a Yankee doctor.

113
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,995
Sir, are you questioning
my resolve?

114
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,765
Yes. And your sanity.

115
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,869
I'm multi-tasking.

116
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,500
General, do not light out.

117
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:42,009
We swore that we would
see the elephant together.

118
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:50,184
Far be it from me to come between
two nut jobs and their elephant.

119
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,259
I could add some mercury if you
want to make it more authentic.

120
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,733
The Confederacy
thanks you, Doc.

121
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:18,113
I got House's phone, deleted
all photos of you and Anita.

122
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:19,940
I owe you.

123
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,714
An affair? Never knew
you were such a tramp.

124
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,084
Neither did I.

125
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:27,648
Anita, she's fun, smart,

126
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,751
not looking for anything serious.
It's pretty perfect.

127
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,424
Except for the gnawing guilt
about the husband,

128
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,966
the lies she
must be telling him.

129
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,400
But not guilty
enough to stop seeing her.

130
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,564
She's smoking hot. And ifs not
his job to protect her marriage.

131
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,974
Aren't you supposed
to be pointing a finger

132
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,599
at your own life as
a cautionary tale'?

133
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,612
If not for cheating,
I might still have a wife

134
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,274
but I wouldn't have
Sophie and Sophia.

135
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:55,480
Which means I wouldn't be preparing
for their visit this week

136
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:59,489
by child-locking all my
cabinets, padding table corners

137
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,686
and getting rid of
every single magazine.

138
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,787
You could probably just hide the
porn in your underwear drawer.

139
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:10,323
The magazines go away so I
won't ignore my children.

140
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,964
I know I have to
pay attention to them,

141
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,834
I want to pay
attention to them.

142
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:18,432
But they're just so

143
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,670
boring.

144
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,980
Did you learn anything
at Jane Doe's school?

145
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,487
<i>They did a bunch of
vaccinations, including pneumococcus.</i>

146
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,353
<i>Take her off the ceftriaxone.</i>

147
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,823
So we're back to square none.

148
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:35,951
<i>Not exactly.</i>

149
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,996
The name she registered
under seems to be fake,

150
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,894
but the address is
a foreclosed house.

151
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,565
We'll let you
know what we find.

152
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,070
Plenty of food, water.

153
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,327
And beer.

154
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:50,136
She eats well, goes to school,
makes good grades.

155
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,707
She's a homeless girl who's
captain of the volleyball team.

156
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,472
How can you be okay with this?

157
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,980
Your mom sends you
to work with snacks.

158
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,710
I want and need parents.

159
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,015
Jane Doe is flourishing
without them.

160
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,314
Maybe.

161
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,554
But this mold definitely is.

162
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,556
<i>You went to my school?</i>

163
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,257
Now that they know
they'll report me.

164
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,490
I can't go back there.

165
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,534
You may have a fungal infection,
you need that medicine.

166
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,695
Fluconazole, right?
I'll get it at a clinic.

167
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,872
I can't feel my legs!

168
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,342
Is that the infection?

169
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,340
I don't think so.

170
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,548
So, what causes an ear bleed,

171
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,245
breathing problems

172
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,289
and our runaway's
inability to run away?

173
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,756
Fungal infection's
off the table.

174
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,224
What about transverse myelitis?

175
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,422
Not with normal
posterior column function.

176
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,531
I've been waiting to do
this for months. Pull!

177
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,071
Sights seem to be off on this.

178
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,300
We didn't call
Social Services before

179
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,208
because we didn't want
the patient to take off.

180
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,043
Now she can't. There's no
reason for us not to call.

181
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,813
How about the reason that there's no reason.
This is working fine for me.

182
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,243
Pull!

183
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,225
That one clearly
took evasive action.

184
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,885
You want to protect her,
because you think

185
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,654
she's fine on her own,
outside the system...

186
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,732
Does anyone have a position on
our patient's medical condition?

187
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,268
Could be endocarditis
with septic emboli.

188
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,394
Pull!

189
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,505
I'd turn around and shoot you,
but apparently I'd miss.

190
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,473
There's no murmurs,
no Osler nodes.

191
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,513
You've never done
this before, have you?

192
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:37,638
No, I have not.

193
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,808
But all the time I had my ankle monitor
on' I was furious that I couldn't.

194
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,621
Vasculitis fits.

195
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:46,983
Start treatment with steroids.

196
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,926
If she's lucky, she'll be
free to flee again.

197
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,792
Not once I call
Social Services.

198
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,422
I'm not giving up.

199
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,158
You wanna bet?

200
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,269
One shot, one birdie.

201
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,133
You hit, you make the call. You
miss, never mention it again.

202
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,666
No. Why would I agree?

203
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,541
Because your only other option
is you call and I fire you.

204
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,791
Pull!

205
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,004
She responding
to corticosteroids?

206
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,241
Looks like it.

207
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,381
And Social Services.

208
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,982
I thought for sure there'd be
some yelling or profanity,

209
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,147
possible bloodletting.

210
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:55,054
She's tired of living
on the streets after all.

211
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,890
I'll bet House regrets...

212
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,897
Could he know I'm
good with a gun?

213
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,334
I don't know how, but...

214
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,338
Hiring a hooker to pretend
to be a social worker?

215
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:14,002
She took a bet that
she knew she'd win.

216
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,078
Frankly, I feel violated.

217
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,342
What happened to the
social worker I called?

218
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,442
Apparently someone identifying
themselves as Dr. Pujols called

219
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,850
and said the patient ran off.

220
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,954
Come on, Poo-holes.

221
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,926
I've informed Social
Services of the mistake

222
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,587
and given Jane Doe's
description to the cops.

223
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,755
They'll track down the parents.

224
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,093
Thank you.

225
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:38,533
I'll leave you
and Dr. Pujols alone.

226
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,105
You should have told me you were
treating an underage clinic patient.

227
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,270
I was giving you
the gift of deniability.

228
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,309
Now I'm giving you the gift
of additional clinic hours.

229
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,471
No, you're not.

230
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,610
You've got nothing on me.

231
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,443
Check your phone.

232
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,615
MY phone?

233
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,054
Right, I guess I did have
some pictures on that

234
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:04,221
But I also have these.

235
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:08,963
Here's the two of you
kissing over dinner.

236
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,728
Busting a move at a nightclub.

237
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,393
Is that your hand
near her nether regions?

238
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,806
Thanks again for
taking out the ankle bracelet.

239
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,400
I'm not gonna let you
blackmail me, House.

240
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,810
Of course not. There's no way
your selling out your integrity

241
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,314
would let me compromise
your job in any major way

242
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,646
over some tawdry bit of gossip.

243
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:32,251
But what about compromising
it in a minor way,

244
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:35,758
reduced clinic hours, unlimited
Internet porn budget.

245
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,159
That makes much more sense than

246
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,662
the nuclear option of
ruining both our lives.

247
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:44,830
You can keep these.
I got copies.

248
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:58,442
God, how I've missed the sweet
smell of sticking it to the man.

249
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,609
Adams is right.
You're protecting this girl.

250
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,685
Oh, no, I was wrong.

251
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,687
That's the stench
of moralizing.

252
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:09,157
I'm protecting myself from
meddling bureaucrats and parents.

253
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,352
You admire this girl.

254
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,727
She had a horrible home life
so she went out on her own.

255
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,060
She's your road not taken.

256
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,998
I've always dreamed of living in
an abandoned house with mold.

257
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:21,367
House, all I'm accusing you of is
having a connection with a patient.

258
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,496
This is a good thing.

259
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,664
It's not a good thing,
'cause it's not a thing.

260
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:28,176
It is a thing, which you'll
prove when her parents show up,

261
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,474
and you start
protecting her from them.

262
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:41,182
The sound I make is "moo."

263
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:46,162
And the sound I
make is "quack."

264
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,511
Moo!

265
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,561
The sound is quack.

266
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,358
Quack, quack.

267
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,532
Quack, quack, quack.

268
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,230
<i>I'm an ass.</i>

269
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:34,937
On the plus side, I can now
program my DVR from my phone.

270
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,036
They are kind of boring.

271
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,274
All kids. Not just yours.

272
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,576
Very helpful.

273
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,613
You need to log more hours.

274
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,119
Eventually you'll pass
boredom, get to bonding.

275
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,089
Like Stockholm syndrome.

276
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,887
I heard the nurses talking. You
called Social Services for real

277
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,655
Because you shouldn't
be living on your own.

278
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,061
Right. Better my mom should
use me as a punching bag.

279
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,490
If your mom abused you,
Social Services

280
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,399
won't let you go home with her.

281
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,004
Have I mentioned I
don't trust the system?

282
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,130
We don't know if you're better yet.
You can't just take off.

283
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,675
Uh...
Can we help you?

284
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,906
I'm Adele Brown from Social
Services, and this...

285
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,074
I'm Ellen Rogers,
Callie's mother.

286
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,742
You haven't been
that for two years.

287
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,649
I promise,
things are different...

288
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,417
Wow, two sentences in and
you're already making promises.

289
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,460
Okay. Maybe we need to take a minute
here and give Callie some space.

290
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,325
No, I don't need a minute. I need
her out of my life.

291
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,421
Is she okay?
I will be once you just...

292
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,527
oh, my God!

293
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,869
We need help in here!

294
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,372
Go!

295
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,205
You bet 100 bucks
on a turtle race?

296
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:49,109
I paid Mr. Chips 5
bucks to take a dive.

297
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,120
The bleeding
stopped on its own.

298
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:56,125
She got worse after being on
steroids, so autoimmune is out.

299
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,320
Diagnosis depends on whether
the blood was coming from

300
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,295
the sinuses, lungs or her guts.

301
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,134
Mr. Chips looks
like he wants it.

302
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,965
100 bucks says he'll make
soup out of Franklin.

303
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:09,696
You're on.

304
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,898
How'd the mom seem to you?

305
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:15,070
If you're asking if she looks like someone
who beat her kid, you're a moron.

306
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,006
Move your ass, Mr. Chips!

307
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,025
You should have seen her face
when mom walked in.

308
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,398
Callie hates her.
I don't think she's lying.

309
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,495
Because people never lie
about people they hate.

310
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,404
Big sinus bleed could be sinusitis
and a bleeding disorder.

311
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,738
She didn't
complain about a headache.

312
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,540
If the bleeding is in her gut,
could be Zollinger-Ellison.

313
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:53,913
Acid reflux causes asthma, and the acid
erodes the stomach, causing the bleeding.

314
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,684
Yes!

315
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,081
Franklin rules.
Mr. Chips drools.

316
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,121
Mr. Chips' owner only
feeds him on apples and bananas.

317
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,890
Nowhere near enough
Vitamin A. Pay up.

318
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,595
Do an upper endoscopy to
confirm Zollinger-Ellison.

319
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,761
After mommy dearest has
given her permission.

320
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,202
Ellen shouldn't have consent
if she beat her daughter.

321
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,237
Doesn't matter if
she beat her daughter.

322
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:20,037
Only matters if Social Services
says she beat her daughter.

323
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,208
Good thing you
made it all official.

324
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:29,386
Will the endoscopy be painful?

325
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,217
Is that an issue?

326
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,556
It's a medical procedure,
there will be some discomfort.

327
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,788
I never meant to
hurt my daughter.

328
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,390
And yet, you hit her.

329
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:42,589
She told you that?

330
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,130
And now you're gonna
tell me you didn't.

331
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,064
I'm a drug addict.

332
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,401
And I've been a lousy mom.

333
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,644
Especially since
my husband died.

334
00:18:55,968 --> 00:19:01,418
He was closer to Callie than I
was, and I missed him so much.

335
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,619
And it was too hard,

336
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:08,419
and taking oxy just
made things easier.

337
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,589
Right up until it
made me lose my daughter.

338
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,433
I hurt Callie a lot.

339
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:23,005
But one of the only things that I can
feel okay about is that I never hit her.

340
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:37,778
Didn't peg you as the midday fun kind of guy.
So glad I was wrong.

341
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:41,447
Mmm...

342
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,860
Unfortunately,
that's not why we're here.

343
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,698
Remember that guy from
the restaurant yesterday?

344
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,124
Mmm-hmm.

345
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,338
He's got pictures of us. He's
threatening to show your husband.

346
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:00,239
I thought you said that guy
was one of your best doctors.

347
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,811
Yeah. Not one
of my best people.

348
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,806
We've got to stop
seeing each other.

349
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,647
Not necessarily.

350
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:10,977
I told my husband about you.

351
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,049
What? Why?

352
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,419
He was saying
that things had been

353
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,154
better lately
between him and I,

354
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,323
that I was happier.

355
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,891
I said that I was,
and that you were the reason.

356
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,528
And he was okay with that?

357
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,768
Not initially. It was a
pretty tough conversation.

358
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:34,504
Neither of us is ready to
give up on the marriage,

359
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,047
and I am not
ready to give up this.

360
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:44,111
You don't have to feel
so guilty anymore.

361
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,868
You didn't need
to shoot yourself.

362
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,136
I could have
given you a Section 8.

363
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,199
We've hit
the drills pretty hard,

364
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,869
and by the fourth round, my hand went numb.
The gun slipped.

365
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,741
And I only had
blanks in it but...

366
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:12,806
It's funny how nearly shooting your
toe off cured that speech impediment.

367
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:17,047
Ha! Yeah. Sorry about that.
Sheldon's a progressive.

368
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,283
Compared to who?
Rupert Murdoch?

369
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,656
Progressives are reenactors who
strive for complete authenticity.

370
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,559
They never drop character
while in uniform.

371
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,656
Whereas you just
dabble in crazy?

372
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,501
Sheldon and I had a big
falling out years ago.

373
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:37,438
We only really started talking
again because of the reenactments.

374
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,306
They gave me my brother back.

375
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,641
That's a very moving story.

376
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,442
Be a lot more affecting
if you hadn't bonded

377
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,847
over something so
completely idiotic.

378
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,648
Your mom didn't
hit you, did she?

379
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:58,626
No.

380
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,028
Then why did you lie about it?

381
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,098
Because I wanted
to get out of here.

382
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:09,169
People understand getting hit
more than what my mom does.

383
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,639
Tell me, maybe I'll understand.

384
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,104
I was the mom.

385
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:23,217
She couldn't keep a job,
spent all her money on pills.

386
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:24,686
I had to get a job.

387
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:28,953
Double shifts just to keep the
power on, keep food in the house.

388
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,955
I couldn't tell you how
many times she nearly OD'd

389
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:35,191
and I had to clean her
up and put her in bed.

390
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,068
So I decided if I was
gonna be the grown-up,

391
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,638
I'd rather do it
on my own terms.

392
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,013
Your mom knows she messed up.

393
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,313
She's determined
not to do it again.

394
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,648
Yeah.

395
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,845
And she'll feel that way

396
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:01,050
right up until
things get too tough

397
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,353
and she has to
start using again.

398
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,601
Do you think people can change?

399
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,165
No.

400
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:20,200
But I don't think that's gonna change
your opinion because people don't change.

401
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:25,173
Stop.

402
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,415
Is that an ulcer?
Yeah, it is.

403
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,080
But we haven't
reached the stomach yet,

404
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,551
I'm still high
in the esophagus.

405
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,514
Means it's not
Zollinger-Ellison.

406
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,016
Ulcer's bleeding.

407
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,092
We need to lavage before she
drowns in her own blood.

408
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,228
We cauterized the ulcer,
stopped the bleeding.

409
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,066
Compromised immune system
from living on the street

410
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,571
could make her
susceptible to HPV.

411
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:51,198
HPV was covered on the STD
panel, she's negative.

412
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,368
What if she didn't get this
from being homeless?

413
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,570
What if she got
it from her mom?

414
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,909
I'm assuming you're thinking
something genetic because...

415
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,277
I'm thinking addiction.

416
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:00,274
Alcohol-induced
esophagitis.

417
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,716
Explains esophageal ulcers
and her other symptoms.

418
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,978
If only it would
explain why we've never

419
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,988
seen her drunk,
drinking or detoxing.

420
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,623
Her blood pressure's been elevated.
Could be the DTs.

421
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,092
It's been mildly elevated.

422
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,121
Mildly elevated BP could put her
at risk for a berry aneurysm.

423
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,100
Weak blood vessel in the brain
gets pounded on by elevated BP,

424
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:21,638
causes it to
expand and contract,

425
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,931
causes the symptoms
to come and go.

426
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:26,169
CT didn't show any
signs of an aneurysm.

427
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:27,744
Did I mention come and go?

428
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,643
As much as your
presence may cause

429
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,645
objects to become
engorged with blood,

430
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,683
sometimes aneurysms
just aren't in the mood.

431
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,309
Alcoholism and berry aneurysm
are both valid theories.

432
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,319
I think we should discuss this
with the patient and her mom.

433
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,946
Why? We've discussed
it right here.

434
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:43,289
Tell them she needs a cerebral
angiogram to locate the aneurysm,

435
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:45,158
surgery to repair.

436
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,198
Brain surgery? When?

437
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:53,270
We've booked the OR
for an hour from now.

438
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,363
And Dr. House is sure
that's what she has?

439
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:57,770
He's confident
in the diagnosis.

440
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,707
It's consistent with
all of her symptoms.

441
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:03,171
But you don't buy it.

442
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:06,107
No.

443
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,679
I think your symptoms are
the result of alcohol abuse.

444
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,281
But I'm not an alcoholic.

445
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,325
You came to the hospital
with beer in your pocket,

446
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:16,789
we found more
alcohol at your house...

447
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,556
Yeah, I use booze as payment.

448
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,459
I have an occasional
beer with my friends.

449
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,556
That doesn't mean
I have a problem.

450
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:27,633
I want the surgery.

451
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,300
Actually,
it's your mom's decision.

452
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:38,808
I'm not an addict

453
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,715
That's what I always said to you,
Callie, but I had a problem.

454
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:43,718
I'm nothing like you.

455
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,720
Tell them to do the surgery.

456
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,332
I need a few minutes to think.

457
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:04,838
The patient asked
me what I thought.

458
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,241
I pay you to think
inside this room.

459
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,073
Outside this room,
I pay you to parrot.

460
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:11,011
It's her choice.
She has the right to know.

461
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,072
It's a medical choice
that you turned into

462
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:15,242
an extension of
your baggage and hers.

463
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,081
You told the mom something
you want to believe

464
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:18,211
because you don't
want to believe that

465
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,416
this girl might be
doing fine parent-free.

466
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,253
Which also happens to be what
the mom wants to believe...

467
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,588
You think she wants to feel responsible
for her daughter's illness?

468
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,685
That woman sees everything
to do with her daughter

469
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,698
through
guilt-colored glasses.

470
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,597
It's all her fault.

471
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,036
House,

472
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:44,380
don't bully her,
she's overwhelmed enough.

473
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,708
It's nothing compared
to how she's gonna feel

474
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,878
when her daughter dies from the
aneurysm she decided not to treat.

475
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,404
You must be Dr. House.

476
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,966
I save my appearances

477
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:18,572
for when parents are on the brink of
doing something incredibly stupid.

478
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:23,912
Your daughter has a berry
aneurysm, she needs surgery.

479
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:27,753
What she does not need is you
making this or any other decision.

480
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:32,156
I can't just
leave this up to her.

481
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:33,355
Then leave it up to me.

482
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,262
And just leave.

483
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,330
I'm not gonna
abandon my daughter.

484
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,362
She hates you.

485
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,601
It's actually not
such a big deal.

486
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,179
Plenty of kids
hate their parents.

487
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:53,773
What makes it a big deal is
that she should hate you.

488
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,513
Playing the biology card doesn't change
anything except where she lives.

489
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,691
Your daughter's
better off without you,

490
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,887
so let her be
better off without you.

491
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,197
I'm gonna do the surgery.

492
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:15,863
I'll take the fallout
from Social Services.

493
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:37,092
Dr. House.

494
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,702
My daughter's
care is my choice.

495
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,196
And so is this.

496
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,167
Treat her for alcoholism.

497
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,740
Peek-a-boo!

498
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:03,376
Why would Anita tell her
husband about our affair'?

499
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,249
Probably just
got sick of lying.

500
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:09,383
Look at it this way, now the sex
is both commitment and guilt-free.

501
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:12,518
And men love
commitment-free sex.

502
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:16,223
Yes, they do.
Oh, yes, they do.

503
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,271
They're gonna
find out eventually.

504
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,136
Peek-a-boo.

505
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,902
How do you keep doing the
same thing over and over

506
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:27,408
with the same
level of enthusiasm?

507
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,142
First off, be a decent,
empathetic person.

508
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,405
This is what you
said you wanted,

509
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,278
but you're actually more upset
now that the husband knows.

510
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,485
Because I'm hurting him.
You always were.

511
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:39,647
But he didn't know that Which
means he wasn't really hurt.

512
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:41,981
Yeah, I know it's
a rationalization,

513
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,960
but it went a long way to making me feel
a little less guilty about seeing her.

514
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:48,554
Looks like you're gonna need
a bigger rationalization.

515
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,898
Peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo.

516
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,465
Social Services
report came in on your mom.

517
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:59,667
Let me guess, she passed
with flying colors.

518
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:01,940
She always does.

519
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,575
I think she might
make it this time.

520
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:10,348
House left a bottle of Vicodin
to see if she'd steal it.

521
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,350
She gave it back.

522
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,253
You could at least let
her sleep in the room.

523
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,124
She could have listened
to me about my drinking.

524
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:25,463
Even if you are right about it,
why take your word over mine'?

525
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,797
I'm her daughter.

526
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:31,635
Because she's your mom.

527
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:34,437
And for the first time
she's acting like it.

528
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,041
It's a little late for that.

529
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,053
Good night.

530
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,229
Morning.

531
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,171
I heard you went
head-to-head with the mom.

532
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:06,537
Not for your reasons.

533
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:07,666
You're protecting the girl.

534
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,073
I'm protecting my diagnosis.

535
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,579
And you tested her, to see if
you could get her back on drugs

536
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,705
and out of her daughter's life.

537
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:16,217
That was to show Adams that
mommy dearest hadn't changed.

538
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:19,687
I'm taking a principled
stand against idealism.

539
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,314
Your patient's stable?

540
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:26,056
Maybe Adams was right. The
illness is alcohol related.

541
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:29,030
I hope so considering that's
what we're treating her for.

542
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:33,000
You hope you're wrong for
the sake of the patient.

543
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:38,838
I hope that I'm right, but the
aneurysm bursts without killing her.

544
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,371
Call me a softie.

545
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:46,513
Or the mom agrees to an
autopsy so I can prove it.

546
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,017
Your patients love you
because you're empathetic.

547
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,961
I also have kind eyes.
Why are you here?

548
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,190
But you don't love
all of your patients.

549
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:05,691
Of course not.

550
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,896
I'll bet some of them bore you.

551
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,632
Dull people get cancer too.
Why are you here?

552
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:14,302
But you fake an interest in them
because you need to, right?

553
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,073
And if you do it long
enough, it becomes real?

554
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:21,275
Well, no, because
the interest isn't fake.

555
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,647
Really?

556
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:26,279
Because you realize
they're not dull,

557
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,948
it was just your
misinterpretation of them.

558
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,425
I just haven't found a way to
make them interesting yet.

559
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,497
It's all about common ground. You
find one thing you both like or hate.

560
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:39,569
John Woo movies,
romance novels, kale.

561
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:45,174
Sometimes the best way
to connect with someone

562
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,903
is stop thinking about them
and focus on yourself.

563
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:52,472
What is this about?

564
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,347
Not everything has an agenda.

565
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,748
See ya.

566
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,418
I told him because
it was the right thing to do.

567
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,150
Right.

568
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:08,321
This doesn't change
anything between us.

569
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,422
It sort of does for me.

570
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,658
You want to stop
seeing each other?

571
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:14,759
No.

572
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:22,942
But I was thinking, maybe you could
tell your husband that we did.

573
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:26,112
And then go back to sneaking
around behind his back?

574
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:28,440
Yes.

575
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:30,951
Why would you want to do that?

576
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,645
I don't know.

577
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:38,120
This just feels wrong.

578
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,695
I think I'm gonna go.

579
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,482
Oh, God!

580
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,354
We thought it was
the salt pork...

581
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,889
But all the menfolk
been eating it

582
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,391
and we're the only
ones that sick.

583
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,339
Which one of you is
the cheap bastard?

584
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:30,502
Your uniforms are not wool They're
polyester, cheap polyester.

585
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,277
Which gets processed with a
heavy metal called antimony.

586
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:35,112
You wear badly
processed polyester

587
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,083
all day and night
for days and nights,

588
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:40,619
and you get antimony poisoning
which causes your diarrhea

589
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:43,090
and your numbness in your hands

590
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:45,692
and your collective vomiting.

591
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,861
Polyester uniforms?

592
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:51,423
I was being authentic.

593
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:53,059
With polyester uniforms?

594
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,727
Confederacy gave men $21

595
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,532
every six months for uniforms...
You poisoned us both.

596
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:57,866
At least I have principles.

597
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,201
Because they don't
cost anything.

598
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:02,538
Brother against brother.
Now that is authentic.

599
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,892
I know you don't want me here,

600
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:23,062
but they had banana
muffins downstairs.

601
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,961
Reminded me of
our St. Pete's trip.

602
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:31,071
Remember?

603
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:35,742
We used to walk and get some
every morning at that bakery.

604
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,577
I guess.

605
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,253
Were you high on that trip?

606
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,959
Not when we were together.

607
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:03,004
I used to wait
until you went to bed.

608
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,137
You can stay,

609
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:14,339
if you want.

610
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:18,647
Okay.

611
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:28,720
Mmm.
It's not bad.

612
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:34,526
What's happening?

613
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,962
Is this from
the alcohol treatment?

614
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,968
I was wrong. The berry
aneurysm must have just burst.

615
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,039
Temporal lobes are clear.
Parietal clear.

616
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:50,377
Get me a micro-vascular clip
tray as well as the occlusion.

617
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:51,545
<i>Check the ventricles.</i>

618
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,713
Ventricles are clear, too.

619
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,651
<i>Aneurysm must've
leaked instead of burst.</i>

620
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,051
<i>Inject the dye.</i>

621
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:12,566
Posterior cerebral clear. Vertebral clear.
Circle of Willis also clear.

622
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,868
She doesn't have
a berry aneurysm.

623
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,951
Her BP is dropping.
Start her on pressors.

624
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:27,353
Get her BP up before her
organs start shutting down.

625
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,221
<i>Adams. With me.</i>

626
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,858
The pressors will only give us
a couple hours, max.

627
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,693
What causes breathing issues,
bleeding issues, paralysis,

628
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,199
<i>loss of consciousness?</i>

629
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:38,694
What are we missing?

630
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:41,033
That's everything bad that's happened.
What about the good stuff'?

631
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,265
You mean, like,
we should be more optimistic?

632
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,203
She got a little better
when we put her on steroids,

633
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,736
which can attack tumor cells.

634
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:47,900
Maybe she has cancer.

635
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:51,241
No hypercalcaemia,
no elevated blood proteins.

636
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:54,077
She and her mom mentioned a trip they
took to Florida a couple of years ago.

637
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,116
What about dengue fever?
Cholera?

638
00:37:56,207 --> 00:38:01,555
Great ideas. If dengue fever or cholera laid
in wail for two years before suddenly...

639
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,434
Did your biological daughter
go swimming in Florida?

640
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:18,836
In a lake, or a pond,
or an everglade?

641
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,940
Yeah, there's a canal
near my mother's house.

642
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,638
Do you know
what's wrong with her?

643
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:27,815
Family vacations kill.

644
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,481
Come with me. Don't want
to explain this twice.

645
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,018
You're letting in the flies.
And she needs an LVAD.

646
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,185
No, she doesn't.

647
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,792
Your daughter has ascariasis.

648
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:48,270
It's a disease caused by a
parasitic worm found in feces.

649
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,272
Animals used
the canal as a potty,

650
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,831
and the eggs from the feces
ended up in Callie's intestine

651
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,706
when she went swimming.

652
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:58,941
Where they hung out, quietly and
asymptomatically biding their time.

653
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,483
<i>Until somewhere along the way,
they got knocked loose,</i>

654
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,951
<i>maybe a dive in
volleyball practice,</i>

655
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,384
or maybe she slipped on her
way into a soup kitchen.

656
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,458
<i>But once they hatched, the worms
got to work on her lungs,</i>

657
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,323
<i>her ear, and the nerves
in her legs.</i>

658
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,726
<i>The worms got agitated
by the steroids we gave her,</i>

659
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,355
<i>which started them on their
journey to the esophagus.</i>

660
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,798
And, ultimately, to the heart.

661
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:23,396
A few pills of mebendazole,
and she'll be fine.

662
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:35,147
She's feeling much better,
walking on her own.

663
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,412
Getting along with her mother?

664
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,317
As long as I keep
bringing her muffins.

665
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,086
Did someone come
take her for a test?

666
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:19,889
Callie agrees with you.

667
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:22,227
That people don't change.

668
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:25,234
She said when her mom slips again,
she didn't want to be there.

669
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,566
She'd rather remember
her like she is now.

670
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,872
Smart girl.

671
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,103
You got the ending you wanted.

672
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:37,372
Because I was only looking to
solve the case, not their lives.

673
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,576
I don't care if the people who
work for me are screwed up,

674
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,749
in fact I even encourage it,

675
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:47,585
but absolution,
do that on your own time.

676
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,151
Or not at all.

677
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,662
Cause clearly you suck at it.

678
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,197
This is Aaron Rodgers.

679
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:37,967
Wow, 127 quarterback rating.

680
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,509
Do you know what
sound he makes?

681
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:49,441
Okay. Ow!

682
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:50,942
Um...

683
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:56,224
This is Terrell Owens.

684
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:58,487
People call him T.O.

685
00:41:58,549 --> 00:41:59,721
Do you know what
sound he makes?

686
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,802
This is Mark Sanchez.

687
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,899
Do you know what sound
people make about him?

688
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:22,140
Working late?

689
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:25,010
Husband have her tonight?

690
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,517
And every night.

691
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,087
She broke it off.

692
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:33,693
It's for the best.

693
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,197
I'm not really
an affair guy after all.

694
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,097
Sure you are, buddy.

695
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,333
You just lost interest once
it stopped being an affair.

696
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,235
That's why you're relieved.

697
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,830
But don't worry,
it's not gonna end here.

698
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,844
You'll just have to get your
adrenaline fix somewhere else.

699
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,675
When that
doesn't do it anymore,

700
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:52,610
you'll just
escalate things somehow.

701
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,885
At least that's
what I've been told.

702
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,214
I'm not like you, House.

703
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,257
True. No limp.
