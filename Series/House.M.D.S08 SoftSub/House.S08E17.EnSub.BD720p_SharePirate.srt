1
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:10,648
Keep breathing.
Nice and slow.

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:16,654
Now, the first couple shots will show you
if the sights are off or the barrel's bent.

3
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,490
Let me make this
real easy for you.

4
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:21,123
The sights are off,
and the barrel's bent.

5
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,532
Mmm... You're off to
the left about an inch.

6
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:31,337
That's it. Shoot around
the star, not at it.

7
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,173
Yes!
Yes! You did it!

8
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,410
I didn't.

9
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,577
You just won your
girlfriend a teddy bear.

10
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:44,849
Cool. Which one do you
think she'd like best?

11
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:52,861
And then Thursday night this physicist
is giving a lecture in Brooklyn.

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,094
It's about time travel
and the grandfather paradox.

13
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,499
I don't know if you're busy...
Okay, Henry. Henry.

14
00:00:58,659 --> 00:00:59,660
Um...

15
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:03,334
Can we talk for a second?
Yeah.

16
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,276
I'm really happy that we've
been hanging out so much.

17
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,276
Yeah, I like you, too.

18
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,879
Can you put down the bear?

19
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,353
Henry.

20
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,717
What?

21
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:24,919
I can't.

22
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,365
I know.

23
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,263
You have a girlfriend.

24
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:34,236
It's just she never seems to
want to do anything with you.

25
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,608
Are you crying?

26
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,311
No' I have allergies. I must
just be, like, tearing up.

27
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,711
Henry, I think that's blood.

28
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,217
What? I...

29
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:29,285
Thirty-five year old male cries
blood, and he's not Vampire Bill. Go.

30
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,154
Should we ask?
Nope.

31
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,655
What, her?

32
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:40,166
Yeah. My favorite companion
is retiring from companning.

33
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,937
So I'm interviewing
her replacements.

34
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,466
Thank you, Butter Scotch.

35
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,011
Is that a family name?

36
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,479
How long are you gonna be using
the office for sex games?

37
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,379
Just so I can plan my day.

38
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,351
Sex'? At work'?
I'm not a savage.

39
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,947
I asked for a cappuccino.
That's what this is.

40
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:06,491
No, cappuccino's got a nice, stiff foam on it.
This is wetter than... Oh...

41
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,899
Almost slipped there.

42
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,630
Well, thank you, Ms. Scotch, but
poor foaming's a deal breaker.

43
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,864
Could you ask the next
candidate to come in'?

44
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:19,171
Initial exam showed no sign of trauma
or subconjunctival hemorrhage.

45
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,372
Lymphocytosis? ALC's in the normal range,
but it's in the high end of normal.

46
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,677
Please take a seat, Fawn.

47
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:29,151
And tell me what's your
favorite Woody Allen movie'?

48
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,714
<i>Annie Hall.</i>

49
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,087
You're interviewing hookers but not
going to talk to them about sex?

50
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,493
Sex is a given.
They're hookers.

51
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,395
Defend your choice.

52
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:42,023
It's the most popular.

53
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,260
Oh, so close.

54
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,338
We would have accepted "Diane
Keaton looks great in suits.“

55
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,174
Or, "It's a trenchant
commentary on today's mores."

56
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,677
Or, "I needed the eggs."
Thanks for your interest.

57
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,347
To get the gig, a call girl...

58
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:02,213
Sorry, "call woman" needs a combination
of skills that I find useful/entertaining

59
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,346
for the remaining 57 minutes
of the hour I pay for.

60
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,359
Lymphocytosis works. Maybe we should
take another look at the blood.

61
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,895
Could also be cavernous
sinus thrombosis.

62
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,759
Clot builds up pressure
at the base of the brain.

63
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,960
Re-run the patient's blood panel
and get a CT venogram of his head.

64
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:19,469
See which one of you is right.

65
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,470
How are you with
small appliance repair?

66
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:27,876
This cavernous
sinus thing, is it dangerous?

67
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:32,039
If Henry's got it, we can treat
with a combo of drugs and surgery.

68
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,775
The success rate is over 70%.

69
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,445
Do you want me to call Amy again?
No, it's fine.

70
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,283
Amy's his girlfriend.

71
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:45,059
I'm the neighbor. I did leave
a message at their number.

72
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,959
Do you want to try her cell? You'll be
here for a few more hours at least.

73
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,296
She doesn't have one.
She worries about radiation.

74
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,234
I could stop by on my way home.

75
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,896
She knows who I am, right?

76
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,566
You don't need to, but thanks.

77
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,834
Good luck.
Okay.

78
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,417
Have you ever paid for sex?

79
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,081
Every guy who's ever seen a Merchant
Ivory movie has paid for sex.

80
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:17,022
No. It just seems too
demeaning to women.

81
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,098
Given the things you've done to
women, that seems arbitrary.

82
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:25,034
You're Chi Park, right?
Who's asking?

83
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,866
You called about my guitar flyer.
You're Micah.

84
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:33,269
This guy's selling a 1974 Gibson
SG Standard in tobacco for $1,250.

85
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:37,347
Yeah, actually, I came in to tell
you I already sold ll. Sorry.

86
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,883
Oh, uh... Thanks anyway.

87
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,791
Blood panel results seem pretty
much the same as before.

88
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,522
And that guy likes you.

89
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:53,996
Maybe we should check for diabetes.
Could weaken conjunctival vessels.

90
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,192
And shut up.

91
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,791
If I'm wrong, then why
is he coming back?

92
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:03,497
My band is rehearsing tomorrow night.
You should come by and jam with us.

93
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,670
That sounds fun.
I'll think about it.

94
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,338
Great. Call me.

95
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,250
Park has a boyfriend.

96
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,251
I'll break your face.

97
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,153
This is the talent portion
of the interview. Okay.

98
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,996
You like cards,
but you can juggle.

99
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,195
I fail to see how this
would be a benefit to you.

100
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,261
What if I'm busy?

101
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,773
You got anything else?
Sure.

102
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:44,448
CT showed no clots
or malformations.

103
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,175
Park and Taub ruled out
lymphocytosis and diabetes.

104
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,686
Well, since you have nothing
of relevance to report,

105
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,585
I assume that you're here to
toss your panties in the ring.

106
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,591
Patient's got a mysterious
girlfriend he really wants to see.

107
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:59,357
She's unreachable by phone, and the
neighbor's never even seen her.

108
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,228
What do you think?
He's gay.

109
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:09,236
I think he's a junkie. The girlfriend is a fix.
If the guy's inhaling glue...

110
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,468
Can you repair a blender?

111
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:11,769
Can you bite me?

112
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,811
Go search the patient's home.

113
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:21,947
Well, thank you, ladies. I've seen
a lot of very talented candidates.

114
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,044
Got a tough decision
in the next few days.

115
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,155
This is the part I hate.

116
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,808
Well, it's not exactly
a crack den.

117
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:49,346
Doesn't exactly look like a
woman lives here either.

118
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,913
"To Amy. I love you."

119
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,980
Okay, she exists. Doesn't
mean he's not a drug addict.

120
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,250
It's good you're playing it cool with House.
Once he gets a rise out of someone...

121
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,263
I'm not crazy about the whole
hooker thing, but I get it.

122
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,995
Other than the fact that ifs
exploitative and dangerous for women,

123
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:13,169
you get what you need without
any of the emotional baggage.

124
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,034
You're not seeing
anyone, I take it?

125
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:19,042
I've been volunteering at the
Trenton Free Clinic. Keeps me busy.

126
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,438
You volunteer every night
and every weekend?

127
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,808
No time to grab dinner?

128
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,044
What's more important?
Making small talk over ravioli

129
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,313
or helping people who
are less fortunate?

130
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,683
By that rationale, none of
us should ever eat again.

131
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:35,055
Well, let's just say
I'm not hungry right now.

132
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,321
Oh, God.

133
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:42,198
I don't think she's breathing.

134
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,131
You think she OD'd?

135
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,167
That or he killed her. Pulse?

136
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,004
No.
I'll call the coroner.

137
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,637
I don't think that's going
to be necessary.

138
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,046
This one works in
financial district.

139
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:04,247
She can get tips.
Give you leg up in market.

140
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,152
What is Fudgey Gonzalez?

141
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:11,886
Ah. Imagine a Vanilla Gonzalez
from the other side.

142
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:24,436
I'm about to make a decision, but there's
still time for you to sneak under the wire.

143
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,942
My favorite Woody Allen
movie is Melinda and Melinda.

144
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:32,111
<i>Our patient is not a junkie,
but he does have a girlfriend.</i>

145
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,956
I call her my girlfriend,
because people understand that.

146
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,427
If I explained it, they'd
just think I was a weirdo.

147
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,122
We're not here to
judge anyone's fetish.

148
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,199
I'm not a pervert.

149
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,271
It's not like I'm more attracted
to dolls than humans.

150
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,066
So you don't have sex with her?

151
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,971
It's not just about that.

152
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,408
Does the doll talk to you?

153
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,375
I know she's not a real person.

154
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,418
In a lot of ways, she's
better than a person.

155
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:12,321
I can tell her things, and she won't
argue with me or make fun of me.

156
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,722
I come home every night and I
know she'll be there waiting.

157
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,420
So is your toaster.

158
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,763
No one in the world has an
emotional attachment to a toaster.

159
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:28,169
But a lot of people are willing to
spend $7,000 on women like Amy.

160
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,233
Have you ever
tried an actual...

161
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:37,009
Yeah, I'm 35. I've been in relationships.
Just none of them fulfilled me.

162
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,277
And one day, I saw
this website, and...

163
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,648
Maybe the perfect woman
is out there somewhere,

164
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:48,749
but it's not worth going through
what it would take to find her.

165
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,019
Amy makes me happy.

166
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,127
You're sweating.
It's sort of hot in here.

167
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,330
Not that hot.

168
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:04,470
Bleeding plus two new symptoms,
fever and neurological.

169
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:08,343
I'm not sure about that last one.
I think he's just weird.

170
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:11,312
He wasn't hallucinating. He
didn't have a thought disorder.

171
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,144
You don't think it's
disordered to talk to...

172
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:16,619
It's not all that different from
talking to your cat or a teddy bear.

173
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,885
You don't have sex with
your cat or teddy bear.

174
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:23,322
If you did, you'd probably
talk to them more.

175
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:27,797
Guy loves an imaginary being who's
never going to respond to him.

176
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,960
He's no crazier than
millions of churchgoers.

177
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:34,470
You think anything off about
any patient is a symptom.

178
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,998
This guy buys ﬂowers, real flowers,
for a piece of plastic in a dress.

179
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,238
You know what's really crazy?

180
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:46,044
Living with a human being. Someone
with opinions and feelings

181
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,915
who gets mad just because you wanna take
salsa classes with them one night a week.

182
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,818
One night.

183
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,357
He's just running away.

184
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,087
He hangs out with a doll. He
never needs to fear rejection.

185
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,753
It's sad. HOUSE: You do
understand the irony here.

186
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,853
Every person in this
room has a sex doll.

187
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,565
At least the patient has the
stones to be honest about it.

188
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,499
Ooh! A metaphor.

189
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,505
What you didn't foresee is that
I actually do have a sex doll.

190
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,031
Your doll is your kids. Yours is your parents.
Yours is your charity.

191
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,738
They're all excuses for not
being in a relationship.

192
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,241
He's not wrong.
And you...

193
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,510
I have meaningless sex
with random strangers.

194
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,574
Thanks for the insight,
but I stopped that months ago.

195
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,587
I actually had a relationship.
With a patient.

196
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:27,355
You just date whoever
happens to cross your path.

197
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,859
My dating is getting
in the way of my dating?

198
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,519
You don't go looking
for the right person.

199
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,029
You just shack up
with whoever's in the room.

200
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,590
And then you get surprised and/or
divorced when it doesn't work out.

201
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,596
I'm surprised you haven't
asked Adams out yet.

202
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,462
Uh...

203
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,934
For your information,
I've got a date tonight.

204
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,874
I'll be jamming with
a cute guy and his band.

205
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,037
- You'll bail.
- He's right.

206
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,876
The obvious solution is for me to
hand my kids over to your parents.

207
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,610
Can we stop trying
to argue the premise

208
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,811
and move on to figuring out why
it is you're all social morons?

209
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,888
You do understand
the irony here.

210
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,456
You're mocking us
for avoiding relationships,

211
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,548
but you can't handle
losing your doll.

212
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:07,064
You're spending all this time and
energy interviewing for a new one.

213
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,400
You're right. Thai is stupid.

214
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,233
What about the patient?

215
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,736
Dude's banging a sex doll,

216
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,302
a festering cesspool of bodily
fluids and associated bacteria.

217
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,439
Swab her out and
find out which one.

218
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,516
I need you.

219
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:33,321
Please don't quit. You're the only
hooker I know who can tune a piano.

220
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,857
If it's about the money, then I can
up you to three nights a week.

221
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,590
I'm getting married, House.

222
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:45,425
His name's Harris.
He's a certified accountant.

223
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:49,337
He loves schlocky horror
movies, and he just moved in.

224
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,599
We're very happy...

225
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,510
Well, you're happy.
Yeah, you're happy,

226
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,104
because he doesn't know
about your employment history.

227
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,444
He knows.

228
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,281
We've talked about ii, and
he accepts me for who I am.

229
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,013
No. He's...

230
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:09,450
If he accepted who you were, he would
not be making you give up your career.

231
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:13,190
Women need their own identities,
their own livelihoods.

232
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:16,893
Otherwise, why was I smoking
all those 'Virginia Slims'?

233
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,962
I know this is weird for you.

234
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,903
But you need to figure out
a way to be okay with it.

235
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,507
I'll miss you, too.

236
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,570
I feel like the
stirrups are overkill.

237
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,769
I've never done a pelvic on a doll before.
I'm unfamiliar with the protocol.

238
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,942
I'm pretty skeeved out
right now. I'm not gonna lie.

239
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,346
What House said back there...
House says a lot of things.

240
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,419
I don't just date
whoever shows up.

241
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:13,287
I mean, I did meet women in the
hospital, but they weren't just flings.

242
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,859
Basically, you're explaining why
you're not gonna ask me out.

243
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,224
That's not what I was.“

244
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,059
Did you want me
to ask you out'?

245
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:27,035
Yeah. I told Park to tell Taub to
tell House to pass you that note.

246
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,473
It's completely clean in there.

247
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,134
He said he had just bathed her.

248
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:41,242
Adams, there's a swelling beneath
the skin, a three-inch mass.

249
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:47,719
Is it part of the
doll's skeleton?

250
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,090
It feels like a tumor.

251
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:05,107
CT showed an air-filled
mass in the doll's abdomen.

252
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,105
It's probably just
a chemical reaction.

253
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,679
Henry left her too close to a
heating pipe or something.

254
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,407
This guy brushes
her hair every morning,

255
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,744
brings home movies for
them to watch together.

256
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,446
You think he tosses her in a broom
closet at the end of each day'?

257
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:19,955
More likely than it
getting stomach cancer.

258
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,649
How about clostridium?

259
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:25,194
Bacteria got trapped in an
airtight cavity, produced gas.

260
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,195
Doesn't explain the
neurological issue.

261
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:31,257
We can explain that the same way
we explain the tooth fairy.

262
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,659
Oh...

263
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,601
I get to play Solomon.

264
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,502
Cut the doll open.

265
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,441
We can't just destroy the patient's property.
That thing cost seven grand.

266
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,708
Exactly. Ask him for consent.

267
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,479
If he says yes, then we get
to go hunting bacteria.

268
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:47,050
If he says no, there's no need,

269
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,710
'cause he's crazy, and
we need a different theory.

270
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,449
See you. Gotta go
build a temple.

271
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,450
Okay.

272
00:16:58,284 --> 00:16:59,957
You're sure?

273
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,623
It won't be able to heal
when we're done.

274
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,835
But you think she could
tell you what's wrong with me.

275
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,027
Yes.

276
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,137
Okay.

277
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,752
Should we take her
to the procedure room?

278
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:27,313
It's not a "her," which means
we can do this anywhere.

279
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:34,829
Adams.

280
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,395
You can know somethings
not real and still love it.

281
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:50,211
I think the procedure room
might be better for this.

282
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,024
You are a horrible person.

283
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,588
All I need is to break up one marriage.
You've broken up three of your own.

284
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,257
You're like the Stephen Hawking
of killing relationships.

285
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,699
Actually, no, Stephen Hawking
is the Stephen Hawking of...

286
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,931
Okay, I have work to do.

287
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,397
Your computer is off.

288
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,634
Sorry, I can't hear you
over my stereo.

289
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:22,770
Why do you assume that marriage
is better than hooking?

290
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,647
We don't know anything about the guy.
He could be a serial killer.

291
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,378
Even if that were true,
it would still be a tossup.

292
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,251
What kind of guy
marries a hooker?

293
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,084
Someone who hires hookers.

294
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,986
And someone who hires hookers is
not exactly the monogamous type.

295
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,154
If we expose him as a cheater...
You're a coward.

296
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:44,064
Would a coward fight to the end to save
a damsel in soon-to-be-proved distress?

297
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,263
Absolutely. If what he's
afraid of is other damsels.

298
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:50,966
Your last relationship failed so
miserably, you ended up in jail.

299
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,974
Now you're clinging
to this hooker

300
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,911
when there are about three billion other
women out there who aren't call girls.

301
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,946
Some of whom are
attractive and intelligent.

302
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:03,283
One of whom is living in your
apartment and is married to you.

303
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,916
You're right.

304
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,753
Why am I asking you for help?

305
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,197
You shouldn't sleep with Chase.

306
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,269
Oh, thank God,
you got here just in time.

307
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,441
What do you have against him?

308
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,775
Nothing. But House has a way
of getting in people's heads.

309
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,509
Just like last week when he was prying
into your relationship with Chase'?

310
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:35,347
It was silly then,
and it's silly now.

311
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,779
Why was it silly then?

312
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:40,624
I'm not 5' 9" with
curves and flowing hair,

313
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,127
so it's impossible for me to get
it on with a good-looking guy'?

314
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,354
Wow. Do you resent me?

315
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,492
You're the quirky,
hard-working sophomore,

316
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,468
and I'm the evil cheerleader
who steals boys?

317
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,735
If you're not getting any,
it's not my fault.

318
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,806
Should we get the one with
the panda on ii or the bird?

319
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,005
Good choice.

320
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:10,177
Pandas eat only bamboo. They
know nothing about cereal.

321
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,755
Your little girl is adorable.

322
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,591
Thanks. She keeps
me very busy.

323
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,858
You and her mom
must be very proud.

324
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,834
Her mother died in childbirth.

325
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:07,901
Amy!

326
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,102
How'd it go?

327
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,445
We're growing cultures now,

328
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:15,985
but she looked clean, and
there was no telltale smell.

329
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:20,387
I'm guessing the lump was just an air
bubble that got trapped in the mold.

330
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:21,991
You bandaged her up.

331
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:26,594
I threw in some stitches, too. Just
wanted to make her look her best.

332
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,666
Do you want me to put her in her chair?

333
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,997
Henry.

334
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,096
Call a code!

335
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,175
Are you looking at the apartment with
those or the transit of Mercury?

336
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:50,652
If night comes,
you will be thanking me.

337
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:52,279
They are seeking heat.

338
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,416
He's an accountant. How late
do you think he's gonna party?

339
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,824
I brought jar to pee in.

340
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,628
<i>Yeah. JESSICA: We heard
crackles in Henry's lungs.</i>

341
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,530
We diuresed him,
but he still needs oxygen.

342
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:07,669
Echo shows normal heart function. Could
be high output failure from anemia.

343
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,932
Hematocrit was rock normal.

344
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:12,339
<i>What is this, mushroom?
Say mushroom, charge two dollars.</i>

345
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,274
Say truffle,
charge five dollars.

346
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,473
Is that the man who
wants to marry hooker?

347
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,345
Probably. But he's
not the one we're after.

348
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,714
Should we ask?
Nope.

349
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,289
Oh! How rude of me
not to situate you.

350
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,358
I'm doing Emily a favor.

351
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,792
<i>We're gonna track her fiancé
until Dominika can seduce</i>

352
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,832
and expose him as the lying
cheater I need him to be.

353
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,060
I'm guessing she didn't
ask for this favor.

354
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:40,702
You know, the noblest gifts are
the ones we give anonymously.

355
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,329
Crackles are non-specific.

356
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,972
<i>Hypoxia plus bleeding could
indicate DIC or some other...</i>

357
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,567
No neurological symptoms?

358
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,010
<i>I knew your bleeding heart
would bring you around.</i>

359
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,049
<i>Too bad it's also taking
you off the market,</i>

360
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,673
and by market, I mean Chase.

361
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:59,880
<i>Come on, buck up, Chase.
There's always Park. Unless...</i>

362
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,826
How did band practice go?
Great.

363
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,589
<i>Does it look like she's lying?
Kind of.</i>

364
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:09,230
Popo needed a ride to the doctor,
and my mother couldn't, so...

365
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,892
You're terrified of dating,

366
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:15,200
because a previous
relationship ended

367
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,536
because your latent rage made
you vicious in arguments, or...

368
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,339
<i>Or reincarnation.</i>

369
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,878
<i>- In a past life she was Anne Boleyn.
- Interesting.</i>

370
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:27,711
Taub feels confident enough to
turn the spotlight on himself.

371
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,582
<i>It's almost as if he
wants me to ask...</i>

372
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:33,016
<i>- What's her name'?
- Wendy Jacobson.</i>

373
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:36,423
Thirty three, Brown grad, family
therapist, HOUSE: Nice choice.

374
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,290
Since you've got
two families to therapize.

375
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:41,024
First date, we didn't discuss
everything important.

376
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,066
It was just a one-night stand.

377
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,293
You're wrong.
I actually like her.

378
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,233
- I'm gonna see her again.
- Mazel tov.

379
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:53,107
Great relationships often start with snap
decisions aimed at proving me wrong.

380
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:56,475
Air bubble in the doll could
mean the silicone is degrading.

381
00:23:56,602 --> 00:24:00,379
If he inhaled some particles...
Silicone deposition.

382
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,114
That could work.
Start him on plasmapheresis.

383
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:08,123
Now, turning to Adams,
my theory is tripartite.

384
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,062
Wanna hear my thesis?
It's kind of interesting.

385
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:16,066
No man comes oui.

386
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:22,231
But old naked lady in 3-C is
eating a whole block of cheese.

387
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:26,099
No, might feel a little cold, though.
Will {his hurt?

388
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,237
- Crap.
- Hey.

389
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,681
I only have a second, but I went
to that time travel lecture.

390
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:36,575
Whoa.

391
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,781
That is awesome.

392
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,828
What is it?

393
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:51,201
It's so... Ugh... Realistic.

394
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,762
And it's all bandaged up.

395
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:01,041
Is it one of those CPR things?
No.

396
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,112
We're starting a procedure,
a little privacy...

397
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,840
No, no. It's good
that she's here.

398
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,984
Molly.

399
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,687
I would like you to meet Amy.

400
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,717
What?

401
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,018
I'm serious.

402
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,861
I know it seems
a little strange,

403
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,631
but she means a lot to me.

404
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:32,039
I gotta get back to work.

405
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,507
You just got here. Sit down.

406
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,149
Yeah, but I said that
I only had a second.

407
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,052
Enjoy the handouts.

408
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,161
Whoa.

409
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,343
Listen, I have to
admit something.

410
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,683
Okay.

411
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,750
Her mom isn't dead.

412
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,393
We're separated.

413
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,262
You're the first person
I've asked out since then.

414
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,735
I'm not used to explaining.
I panicked.

415
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,770
Which I regret, because now
that I've gotten to know you,

416
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,203
I like you.

417
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:46,781
It was a really stupid lie.
I'm sorry.

418
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,220
Was that a different baby?

419
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:55,714
No.

420
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,551
That was a different baby.

421
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,075
It's nice having you here.

422
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,916
I wish you could come over
and get in bed with me.

423
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:33,758
Like this?

424
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:36,425
You're talking.

425
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:37,865
That's not all I can do.

426
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:58,554
Amy, there are doctors...
Shh...

427
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,051
I don't know.

428
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,318
Just put your hands on me.

429
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:19,998
It hurts.

430
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,475
Ah!

431
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,584
Pushing lorazepam.

432
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:40,657
If it wasn't neurological
before, it sure is now.

433
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,390
Right upper quad rant's
distended.

434
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:45,263
He's hallucinating
because his liver is failing.

435
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:53,272
Elevated transaminases
confirm liver failure.

436
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:55,402
We'll have to put him on the
transplant list in a couple of days.

437
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,878
It's clearly not the silicone.
Could be vasculitis.

438
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,505
Serologies were negative.

439
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,584
Yeah. If you want
Adams to hear,

440
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,849
you might wanna not stand
so conspicuously far away.

441
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,049
I'm making coffee.

442
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,092
And sometimes I date co-workers.
Like everyone else on the planet.

443
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:15,757
Hepatic fibrosis. If it damaged his
platelets, it'd explain the bleeding.

444
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,562
Unexpected. I actually thought
you might agree with my theory.

445
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:20,399
Because that would mean
nothing's your fault.

446
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,802
You fell into relationships based on proximity.
Of course they'd fail.

447
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:28,377
But I guess I was wrong. You picked perfect women.
You just screwed it up.

448
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:33,443
How about all five of us sleep
together and the $7,000 sex doll?

449
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,711
It'll solve all of our hang-ups.
$7,000?

450
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:40,415
Adams suggests that we all sleep
together, and your issue is high prices.

451
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,047
- Pretty sure she was joking.
- Yes.

452
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,288
I'm 99% sure that you're right, but
I would never forgive myself...

453
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:48,331
Those dolls are only $5,000. He must
have had it customized somehow.

454
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,893
Oh, like you didn't
check the website.

455
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,739
Guess we don't need to ask
how your dating life is going.

456
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,068
I was curious.

457
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:01,142
Hepatic fibrosis wouldn't
cause difficulty breathing.

458
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:04,737
It would if liver failure
opened pulmonary AV shunts.

459
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:09,818
Fibrosis fits. Start the patient on steroids.
And find out how he pimped his ride.

460
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:14,083
Why? Because I don't
know the answer.

461
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:26,927
<i>HEY...</i>

462
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,665
- Foosball?
- Can't.

463
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,673
Marriage to destroy.
Okay.

464
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:37,005
"Okay," as in passive-aggressive
reverse psychology?

465
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:39,275
Or as in depressed resignation?

466
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,381
"Okay," as in
I changed my mind.

467
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:44,947
Expand.

468
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,957
It's morally reprehensible
and bound to fail,

469
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,119
but in a weird way, it's a step
forward, this thing with Emily.

470
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,959
Contract. It's real
without being real.

471
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,693
It's a long term relationship
that can't actually hurt you.

472
00:30:56,788 --> 00:31:00,861
It's a stepping stone.
It means you want more.

473
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:06,139
So passive-aggressive
reverse psychology. Got it.

474
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:17,813
Try not to come on too strong, okay. Just
get to know him a little. Ease into it.

475
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,254
<i>Why would I ease?</i>

476
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:23,723
True, you could just walk up and
stick your hand down his pants,

477
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,385
but I've heard
there's a middle step.

478
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,430
Men want to have sex.

479
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,828
Not with crazy people.

480
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,335
Well, yes, a lot with crazy people,
but not that kind of crazy.

481
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:34,904
Well, yeah, that
kind of crazy, but...

482
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,007
They don't care how crazy
if she looks like me.

483
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:39,767
Okay. Easing.

484
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,849
Hi.
Hey.

485
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,682
<i>I'm Jennifer, new to
Marketing Department.</i>

486
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:55,350
<i>Harris. Accounts receivable.
Interesting.</i>

487
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:58,553
<i>Do you want to get out
of here and have sex?</i>

488
00:31:58,617 --> 00:31:59,925
<i>Sure.</i>

489
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,965
<i>You know, I've got 45 minutes
left on my lunch break. Mmm-hmm.</i>

490
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,296
<i>Where do you want to go?</i>

491
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:11,067
Off to a place where men don't
cheat on the women they love.

492
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:13,699
You're not invited, obviously.

493
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:16,542
Cheating? What are
you talking about?

494
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:21,809
Well, I hope you're speaking out of
some deep kind of moral relativism.

495
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,978
Because if...
Who are you people?

496
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,721
You're not Emily's fiancé.

497
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:28,924
Emily's my sister.

498
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:38,902
We called the company
that made Amy.

499
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:43,898
They said they modeled her after
some photos you sent them.

500
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,069
Who is she?

501
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:56,317
We met last Christmas.
She's a yoga instructor.

502
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:03,588
Totally different from me. She
loved Chopin, hated Indian food.

503
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:11,191
She changed my entire
life for 17 weeks.

504
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,933
My husband cheated on me.

505
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:27,883
With a girl he met on the plane
coming back from our honeymoon.

506
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,520
It's not easy to get
past things like that.

507
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,955
She wasn't unfaithful. She
didn't betray me. She just...

508
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,627
Just wasn't in love with me.

509
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,646
I know Amy's not going
to break your heart,

510
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,848
but she's also not going
to change your life.

511
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,648
That light's bright.

512
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:15,422
Sorry. What's happening to me?

513
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,596
Is your neck stiff?
Yeah.

514
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:21,164
I think you have meningitis.

515
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:27,503
I'm not leaving the business.
I'm just leaving you.

516
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:30,677
I didn't want you to feel bad.

517
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,248
So, let me get this straight.

518
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:36,547
I'm being dumped by a hooker
who's worried about my feelings.

519
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:39,349
You're married. Half your
clients are married.

520
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,946
And you're a hooker.

521
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,458
My other guys sneak around.

522
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:46,688
But you'll take me into the bedroom
while your wife's in the next room.

523
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,929
That's just mean.

524
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,795
Oh, thank God.

525
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,062
The marriage, it's a sham.

526
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,398
The only real thing about it is the Green
Card she's gonna get at the end of it.

527
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:01,038
So, if you wanna get
the meter running...

528
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,905
It's still mean.

529
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,877
It's not a marriage.
It's a felony.

530
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:10,920
I've seen how she looks
at you when you're together.

531
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:14,046
Trust me, she likes you.

532
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,250
And I've seen how
you look at her.

533
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,927
<i>Fever's up to 105.
He's not responding to meds</i>

534
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:31,901
At this rate, he'll be dead by the
time we get the cultures back.

535
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,967
Spinal fluid was full of white cells.
Meningitis could be carcinomatous.

536
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,670
Cytology showed nothing.

537
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:39,180
An amoebic infection would
cause fever and meningitis.

538
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,183
But not liver failure.
It could if he had a clot.

539
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,685
How would amoebas
get past his cribriform plate?

540
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,154
He went swimming in a
frozen lake in New Jersey?

541
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:53,027
Adams said his ex-girlfriend
was a yoga instructor.

542
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,155
Maybe he sprained his chakras.

543
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,923
Yoga nuts are way more likely to
be into alternative medicine.

544
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,765
He had this weird little
teapot in his house.

545
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:03,497
What was it like?

546
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:07,607
I don't know.
Little, weird, teapot-ish.

547
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,450
Was it like that?
Yeah.

548
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,786
You think he drank
some sort of toxic herbal tea?

549
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:25,291
Yes, if by tea you
mean salted tap water,

550
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,793
and by drank you mean
poured up his nose.

551
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:30,193
His girlfriend didn't just
leave him with a broken heart.

552
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,959
She left him with a neti pol.

553
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:37,402
It's an Indian method of clearing
the sinuses during allergy season,

554
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:38,906
also known as now.

555
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:42,809
<i>With distilled water, it can
act as a snot-flushing system.</i>

556
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,576
<i>With tap water, it can act
as an amoeba-delivery system</i>

557
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,150
to the fluids around the brain.

558
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,981
Start him on metronidazole.

559
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,490
If he's lucky, he'll get to see his
plastic children walk down the aisle.

560
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:02,324
My neck feels much better.

561
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,561
Your fever's gone, and your liver
function's almost back to normal.

562
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:08,103
You should be able
to go home soon.

563
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:10,901
I'm going to have some
hospital bills to pay.

564
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:14,909
I don't suppose used sex dolls
go for anything online'?

565
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,175
Dr. Adams?

566
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,614
Can I get your email?

567
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,716
What for?

568
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,688
I just thought maybe we
could see each other again.

569
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,086
I can't.

570
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,392
No, I know it's
a professionalism thing,

571
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,730
but you won't be my doctor
when I get out of here.

572
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,067
It's not that. It's...
What is it?

573
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:43,970
You said I should
change my life.

574
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,872
You were talking about yourself, too.
I know you were.

575
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,572
Henry. I think you
should ask Molly out.

576
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:58,081
I should have known
this would happen.

577
00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:03,388
You're a good guy, Henry.
You deserve more than a doll.

578
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:09,664
Promise me you'll keep trying.

579
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,064
Okay.

580
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:25,404
Date tonight?
No.

581
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,416
So she can't deal. There's
someone out there who can.

582
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,988
You just got to find her.

583
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:36,115
I'd love to prove
House wrong, but...

584
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,928
I ruined my marriage,
broke two people's hearts,

585
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:45,161
had two kids who are always gonna wonder
why I didn't love their mommy enough.

586
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:49,097
It's better if I just
focus on what I do have.

587
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:54,500
Give that band guy a call.

588
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,840
I'm not that good at guitar.

589
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,811
Or flirting or small talk?

590
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:08,181
I'm not as pretty as Adams. I have
stuffy clothes, and I hate my hair.

591
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:11,624
Adams works 80 hours a week
fixing bunions on hobos,

592
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,994
because she can't face
getting to know someone new.

593
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,400
Trust me, you find a boyfriend,
she'll be the jealous one.

594
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,305
See you tomorrow.

595
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:31,236
Do you

596
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:36,379
want to get a drink?

597
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:39,049
To annoy Park?
Or to prove House wrong?

598
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,312
Oh, I...

599
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:45,326
It's just I think
it's time for a change.

600
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,898
I don't really think that's a
good idea for me right now.

601
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,403
House has a way of getting
in people's heads.

602
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

603
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,453
No, Mom. I'm still at work.

604
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:21,558
I'll be home in a couple of hours.
Love you, too.

605
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:36,573
Ready? One, two,
three, four.

606
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:56,720
I fixed blender.

607
00:41:58,116 --> 00:41:59,789
So I see.

608
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,965
I had fun seducing
hooker's fake fiancé.

609
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:05,624
Sorry it didn't work.

610
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:10,468
Yeah. I thought I'd take a break
from the whole hooker thing.

611
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:16,812
I think maybe you need
milkshake. ls pistachio.

612
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:34,096
Well, I'm going to go to bed.
See you tomorrow.
