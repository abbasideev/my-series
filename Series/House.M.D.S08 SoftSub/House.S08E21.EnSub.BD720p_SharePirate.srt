1
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:35,841
Come on in.

2
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,306
I'm not doing any more chemo.

3
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:47,682
Good plan.

4
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,155
You'll be dead in five months.

5
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,827
We went for a cure,
it didn't work.

6
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,726
I've thought about this a lot.

7
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,998
Five more months on
this Earth is reasonable.

8
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:05,665
A year in the hospital
in excruciating pain is

9
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,340
not.

10
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,782
With two weeks on,
two weeks off of chemo,

11
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,907
you could have way
more than a year.

12
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,412
Maybe two or three.

13
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,511
House.

14
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,415
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,529
I'm not gonna let you just die.

16
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:21,950
He?'

17
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,520
You know' management
research shows that

18
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,147
the best ideas come
from casual contact.

19
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,117
So, one set of season tickets.

20
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:31,923
I got the seat next to you.

21
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,430
First game is October 8th.

22
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,993
It's about one month after
Wilson's expiration date.

23
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,530
This isn't
an unstructured collaboration.

24
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,335
You're trying to
be the new Wilson.

25
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,001
I'm trying to show you there are
other people who care about you.

26
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,138
Relax. I'm probably
not gonna fall apart.

27
00:02:55,475 --> 00:03:00,356
<i>Five, six, seven, eight. One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.</i>

28
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:05,362
<i>One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight. Here we go.</i>

29
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,453
Cradle. One...

30
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,967
Put down the pom-poms and
step away from the computer.

31
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,669
46-year-old
oncologist refuses treatment.

32
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,740
Foreman already gave us a case.

33
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,172
Wants us to keep
things as normal

34
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,006
as possible for as
long as possible.

35
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,973
Wilson is dying, Chase is gone,

36
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,175
how close to normal
do you think we can come?

37
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,349
19-year-old cheerleader,
admitted with

38
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,318
massive
nosebleed and dizziness.

39
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,256
Wow, cool, I just completely forgot
that my best friend is dying.

40
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,821
Wait, that just reminded me.

41
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,394
Head CT is clean.

42
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,158
How can we turn Wilson
from a terminal idiot

43
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,724
into an interminable
pain in the ass?

44
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:46,269
A mini-stroke could
explain our patient's

45
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,770
neuro symptoms and
his butterfingers.

46
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,204
But not his bloody nose.

47
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,333
My best friend is
trying to kill himself.

48
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,543
He just wants to die
with a little dignity.

49
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,207
There's no such thing.

50
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,511
It's not your choice, House.

51
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,349
Your only choice here is
between acceptance and misery.

52
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,691
It's a midline granuloma.
Get your patient a PET scan.

53
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,367
No lesions along the optic track...
You already covered that.

54
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,370
Maybe we should get someone
else to take this case.

55
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,805
Why'? Because someone
somewhere is dying?

56
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,212
Oh, crap! Turn off the mic.

57
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,579
It is off.

58
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:40,089
Not according to his brain His
temporal lobe is completely lit up.

59
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:44,719
Auditory portion.
He's hearing something.

60
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,277
Foreman's trying to date me.

61
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,570
I assume that's
because you called him.

62
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,515
No, I...

63
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:09,178
Did you put
something in my coffee?

64
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:13,622
You know how you can be there
for me five months from now?

65
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,749
Don't be dead
five months from now.

66
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:31,765
Hey, Wilson...

67
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,672
Seriously?

68
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:36,974
Just a little picker-downer.

69
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,377
I assume this unwanted interruption
means you're looking for me

70
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,850
to discuss
the latest development

71
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,013
in a case I don't
want to discuss.

72
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,779
Our patient is hearing voices.

73
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,881
He denies it, but the PET
scan says otherwise.

74
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:51,019
He's at the right age for
the onset of schizophrenia.

75
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,324
Yeah. You really need me.

76
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,899
Ultrasound his abdomen
to check for schizophrenia.

77
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:59,198
We already ordered a psych evaluation,
but drugs could also cause...

78
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,999
Tox screen was clean.

79
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,504
Ultrasound his dorm.

80
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:10,481
Whoa! You guys can't just come
busting in here without a warrant.

81
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:14,243
We're not cops.
We're your roommate's doctors.

82
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:22,055
Any idea what flavor of drugs would
be making your roommate sick?

83
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,150
Objection. Entrapment.

84
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,024
I'm pre-law.

85
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,329
Derrick doesn't party.

86
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,502
Look at this.

87
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,067
Why would he have
a picture of a little boy?

88
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,938
Maybe it's his
nephew or something?

89
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,166
Hidden in his sock drawer?

90
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:41,902
Whoa!

91
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,345
Creepy.

92
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,188
We need to talk to Derrick
about some medical matters.

93
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,022
Well, she's my girlfriend.
She can be here for that.

94
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:04,301
We found this
in your dorm room.

95
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,201
Who is that?

96
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,566
Nobody.

97
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,865
Then why was it
hidden in a drawer?

98
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,641
Derrick, what's
she talking about?

99
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,743
It's my brother, Christopher.

100
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,887
You never told me
you had a brother.

101
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,390
Well, he's been dead
almost 10 years, so...

102
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,253
Is that the voice
you hear in your head?

103
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,226
Mmm!

104
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,676
And, lo, he is risen.

105
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,914
So now my hair's
gonna fall out next week?

106
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:58,084
No, all I did was temporarily kill you.
How was it?

107
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:01,692
Look, I wasn't dead.
I was unconscious.

108
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:05,593
No dreams or thoughts.
You experience nothing.

109
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,591
Now, imagine that without the
waking up on the couch part.

110
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:12,430
Just nothing, times infinity.

111
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,708
You didn't just prove death is nothing.
You proved propofol is.

112
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,606
You're saying the end
is not the end'?

113
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,948
I was expecting, "Nothing is
better than something lousy,"

114
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,318
but not, "The angels
are waiting for me."

115
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,954
I'm not having
this conversation.

116
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,352
Why? Because it
doesn't make sense?

117
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,161
Because I'm not gonna change
your mind, and I don't care.

118
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,355
More importantly,
you're not gonna change mine.

119
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,694
There is no heaven,
there is no hell,

120
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,326
your soul is not gonna
float out of your body

121
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,995
and join some great,
unifying energy force.

122
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,971
The fact that you're dying
is not gonna change that.

123
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,974
Please, just go.

124
00:08:58,805 --> 00:08:59,806
House.

125
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:07,516
I have spent the last 20 years holding
the hands of people as they die.

126
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,150
When I watch that
transformation...

127
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:17,601
I'm sorry, I don't believe that
we're just a bag of chemicals.

128
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:34,781
So are we gonna talk about the
patient, or wait for House?

129
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,612
Viral encephalitis.

130
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,345
It's been going
on for 10 years.

131
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,793
I'm gonna go in there
and invite him to participate.

132
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,190
I think he'd
welcome the distraction.

133
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:48,755
Come with me?

134
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,394
Why?

135
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,102
When was the last time House
listened to anything we said

136
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,370
about anything personal?

137
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,807
Maybe you'll feel better,
but sometimes, the truth is,

138
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,108
there's nothing anyone can do.

139
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,716
Temporal lobe epilepsy.

140
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,390
Causes voices, dizziness.

141
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,724
Trauma from a seizure
would explain the nose bleed.

142
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,162
You know about
all of my siblings,

143
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,130
and cousins,
and aunts and uncles, and...

144
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,293
You're overreacting.

145
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,563
Because you don't trust me
enough to tell me about...

146
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,799
Sorry. It's time to
go down for your test.

147
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:34,172
If you want to wait here,
it'll only take about an hour.

148
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,678
No, she's leaving.

149
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,277
Derrick, come on. I mean,
we should at least talk.

150
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,509
No, I'd rather you just leave.

151
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,253
And you don't need
to come back.

152
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,202
<i>Time. Any odd
tastes or smells?</i>

153
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,304
No. Feel fine.

154
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,933
Things looked
fine on my end, too.

155
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,443
So you won't
admit to your doctors

156
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,712
that you're hearing
your brother's voice,

157
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,616
which is dangerous.

158
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,280
And now, you lost
your girlfriend over it.

159
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:20,890
Which is stupid.

160
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,721
I assume there's
more to the story?

161
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,826
That's how I was raised.

162
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:27,623
Short story.
Yeah.

163
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,227
My boss is losing his
best friend to cancer.

164
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,161
And instead of
talking about the pain,

165
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,535
he's pretending
there is no pain,

166
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,506
because
everything can be fixed.

167
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,148
My father tried
to deal with it.

168
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:49,520
Ironic that he'd drink
himself into oblivion

169
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,988
after my brother was
killed by a drunk driver.

170
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,356
Do you need a tissue?

171
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:06,903
After Dad left,
my mom moved us away.

172
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:10,941
She got rid of all the pictures of
Christopher and never mentioned him again.

173
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,366
It was like he never existed.

174
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,069
And that worked for us.

175
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,772
And, yet, you kept one.

176
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,881
Uh... My right eye...

177
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,684
I was seeing spots, but now I can't see at all.
Is that from the test?

178
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,186
No, this is something else.

179
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,952
Ah! That hurts!
Sorry.

180
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,356
How many fingers?

181
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,131
Two. Fuzzy ones, but two.

182
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,228
It's a clot in the artery behind your eye.
I just broke it up.

183
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,270
Is that bad?

184
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,204
Don't know. Because I don't
know why it happened.

185
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,704
He?'

186
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:53,542
Saved us a table.

187
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,641
There are no tables.

188
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:57,813
I recently hacked
into your old files.

189
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,119
Found a 6-year-old boy
with bilateral retinoblastoma.

190
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,659
Doctors wanted to
take his eyes out

191
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,227
before the cancer
spread to his brain.

192
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:09,960
But you fought them. Advocated
for a new photon beam radiation.

193
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:12,434
Saved the kid's vision,
probably saved his life.

194
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,499
That was my first case at PPTH.
Mikey Kimble.

195
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:17,768
It's Michael, now.

196
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,936
Oh, yeah, this is our table.

197
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,104
Wow.

198
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,810
How are you?

199
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,153
I'm doing great.
Graduating next month.

200
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,654
Already? Little Mikey?

201
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,692
And I got
accepted to Princeton.

202
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,096
I'm planning on
going to med school.

203
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,938
He's going to be a doctor.
Instead of being dead.

204
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,936
Dr. House told me all
about your situation.

205
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,875
That's why I came.

206
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,108
There's just so much
good that you can do,

207
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,344
even in a small amount of time.

208
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,452
I wonder...

209
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:09,782
Hey!

210
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:14,295
Is there anybody else here who's alive
today because of Dr. James Wilson?

211
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:39,052
Gastric adenocarcinoma.
Fifteen years in remission.

212
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:42,885
Six grandchildren
that I never would have met.

213
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,560
Thank you, Dr. Wilson.

214
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,827
Squamous cell lung cancer.

215
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,060
Twelve years in remission.

216
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,500
I was able to walk my daughter
down the aisle last May.

217
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,861
Thank you, Dr. Wilson.

218
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:06,773
I did the math.

219
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,950
Seventy-four children are
alive today because of you.

220
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,188
Fourteen grandchildren.

221
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,463
Mikey Kimble started kindergarten
before the age cut-off.

222
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,127
He would have graduated
high school last year.

223
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:30,463
I flunked a year?

224
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,235
Was anybody in this room
really a patient of mine?

225
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,443
They're somewhere.

226
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,951
They're giving you
a standing "0" somewhere.

227
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,318
They exist.
You saved their lives.

228
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,829
It's actually more impressive
that they're too busy to be here.

229
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:00,660
What's this?

230
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,171
A glowing letter
of recommendation

231
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,332
you just wrote
for me on my laptop.

232
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,740
I noticed it's lacking
your signature at the bottom.

233
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,837
Don't you think you're being a bit
premature predicting House's demise?

234
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,007
Not demise, just implosion.

235
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,943
He's going
through a rough time.

236
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,917
But, so far, he's been handling it...

237
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:29,522
<i>House?</i>

238
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,670
Your shoes are wet.

239
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,466
Glad to see your
emotional turmoil

240
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,940
hasn't dulled your
powers of observation.

241
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,302
I know you're responsible.

242
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:44,974
No, you don't. Because I didn't do it.
Whatever "it" is.

243
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,544
But if I had shoved those season
tickets down some toilets,

244
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,621
I would have done it
because you asked me to.

245
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:55,122
You wanted to replace Wilson.
I prank Wilson all the time.

246
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,489
Enjoy.

247
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,581
I got you three,
but I drank them.

248
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,924
You didn't have to call me, but
I appreciate I made the list.

249
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,257
It wasn't entirely unselfish.

250
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,404
I didn't feel right approaching

251
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,905
any of my
terminal patients, but...

252
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,441
What is it like?

253
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:52,672
Hmm...

254
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,076
Does it ever
stop being surreal?

255
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:04,387
<i>It'll stop in about five or six
months, give or take, in your case.</i>

256
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,890
You know what
happened to me today?

257
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:13,301
One of my patients
suddenly started crying.

258
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,369
It can't be your first

259
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,905
It was the first one
who was crying for me.

260
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,644
It's the human response.
It's either overly saccharine,

261
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,911
because giving sympathy
makes them feel better,

262
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,450
or they ignore you,

263
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:32,489
because hiding from mortality
makes them feel better.

264
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,923
Well, why can't they just say
something that makes me feel better?

265
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,225
Like what, exactly?

266
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,327
I don't know.
No.

267
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,126
Mmm...

268
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,507
You'd be doing what?
Two weeks on, two weeks off?

269
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,579
So maybe do your first round,
see how it goes.

270
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,476
May be not as
horrible as you fear.

271
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,915
Then do the second round,
enjoy your two weeks off,

272
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,750
and revisit the decision.
Rinse, repeat.

273
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,660
I just can't envision
spending my remaining time

274
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,959
in a chemo suite in Princeton.

275
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,706
I want to enjoy myself
with family and friends.

276
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,442
Friends, or friend?

277
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,879
Hi, this is Greg House again.
Third message.

278
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:37,216
Hopefully indicating how much
I want you to call me back.

279
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,313
I'd say that your son is dying
to increase the urgency,

280
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,222
but you probably
already know that.

281
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,662
The fake people who care that
Wilson stays alive didn't work,

282
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,665
so I need the real people
who care about him

283
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,325
to tell him what
an idiot he's being.

284
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:51,693
Where are we going?

285
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,393
Well, I just got paged
to go to the bathroom.

286
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,062
I don't know where
the rest of you are going.

287
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:58,202
Some of our patient's symptoms
might be physiological

288
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,038
and some might
be psychological.

289
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,975
You think being forced
to bury painful memories

290
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,172
is making his symptoms worse?

291
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,079
Grief avoidance can lead lo all
sorts of anxiety disorders,

292
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:10,018
which can manifest
into physical illness.

293
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,915
Let's assume that all his
symptoms are real symptoms.

294
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,523
So we're going to
avoid grief avoidance?

295
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,324
Studies after
September 11th showed that

296
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,160
repression was
actually better for coping

297
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,427
than dwelling in misery.

298
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,064
What about polycythemia vera?

299
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,262
RBC's are slightly
elevated, but not that much.

300
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,838
Hodgkin's lymphoma?

301
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,339
Would have shown
up on the PET scan.

302
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,773
What if our guy
got hurt at practice

303
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,676
and, like everything else,
just didn't tell anyone?

304
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,912
Could have set off DIC.
Would explain everything.

305
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,506
I thought you had to
go to the bathroom.

306
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,180
I didn't say I had to go in.

307
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,178
Need some more mops in here!

308
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,427
What exactly are
you looking for?

309
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,422
Blood. If your spinal fluid
is yellow instead of clear,

310
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,263
it means you've had
a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

311
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,973
What does your
brother say to you?

312
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,767
Does he tell you
you're gonna be okay?

313
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,205
It doesn't
really work like that.

314
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,384
I think you hear your
brother's voice for a reason.

315
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,110
I thought you guys said that I
hear things because I'm sick.

316
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:20,122
Yes, but that doesn't explain why
you don't hear a different voice.

317
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,585
I think your mom
didn't let you deal

318
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,888
with the grief of
losing your brother properly.

319
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,229
There are people here
who could help you with that.

320
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:34,894
Okay.

321
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,669
The opening
pressure's way too high.

322
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,702
The prodigal daughter returns.

323
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,866
You taking me up on
my offer to off you?

324
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,336
I think I've still got
some leftover propofol.

325
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,943
I spoke to Wilson.

326
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,949
He's angry because I want him to live longer.
Who wouldn't be?

327
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,118
Friends respect
each other's decisions,

328
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,685
even if they
don't agree with them.

329
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:24,777
It's called loyalty.

330
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,551
Loyalty is a tool to get people

331
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,283
to do things they
don't want to do.

332
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,183
But you do want to.

333
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,289
And you may have rationalized
it 100 different ways,

334
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,460
but the fact is
you fired me so that

335
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:40,695
I'd be forced to
spend the rest of my life

336
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:43,296
doing exactly
what I wanted to do.

337
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:49,811
It was probably the most selfless
thing anyone has ever done for me.

338
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:53,875
And you don't even
like me that much.

339
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,921
I surrender.

340
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,609
I have been a disloyal,

341
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,003
disrespectful jerk.

342
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,174
I should've listened
to what you wanted.

343
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,943
I'm still not letting my
parents return your call.

344
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:35,086
I made a reservation for two at Carmine's.
Tonight, 8:00.

345
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,688
No more tricks.
No more manipulations.

346
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,530
Said Machiavelli.

347
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:47,369
Just two friends enjoying
the time they have left.

348
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,037
Please, don't...
I'm not.

349
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:50,629
I promise.

350
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:54,867
Just dinner?

351
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,478
That depends on
how much you have to drink.

352
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:02,208
Sounds nice.

353
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:13,129
Mom.

354
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,288
I came as soon as
I got your message.

355
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,330
Is he gonna be okay?

356
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,458
We're hoping it's
just excess fluid

357
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,593
on his brain from
an extreme migraine.

358
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,096
Which isn't good,
but it's treatable.

359
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:25,667
He's scheduled to get an MRI as soon
as these meds start taking effect.

360
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,075
We found that
picture in his dorm room.

361
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,850
I'm not sure what
Derrick's told you,

362
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:43,925
but he's been hearing Christopher's
voice for the last 10 years.

363
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:48,129
And it's possible that repressing
all that grief he's felt

364
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:50,861
is actually causing some of
Derrick's symptoms.

365
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:57,333
I don't even know if this voice in
my head is something I invented,

366
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,375
or if it's what
Christopher was really like.

367
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:02,203
With no photos, no video,

368
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,214
my memories,

369
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,949
I really don't
have any anymore.

370
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,850
Maybe you could just

371
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,496
tell me a little bit about him?

372
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,528
I'm sorry.
It was a long drive in.

373
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,470
I'm gonna go get a coffee.

374
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,530
Okay.

375
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:43,214
Seventy-nine years old and you
told her she was pregnant.

376
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,747
Well, it cured her hiccups.

377
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,257
I'll say I didn't expect her
to cry for quite so long.

378
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:55,526
Now, I know that
the tiramisu is great here,

379
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,396
but I actually
ordered off menu.

380
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:11,442
Greg, Hold you you didn't hang
the bear bag high enough.

381
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,379
It was a smart bear.

382
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,380
I'm almost certain
he untied my knots.

383
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,748
Well, he wasn't that smart
He left the Oreos behind.

384
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:23,121
You hiked for 32 miles eating
nothing but creamy filling.

385
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,353
The black stuff is overrated.

386
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:28,788
To climbing the hill.

387
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,066
Okay.

388
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:43,102
If I did decide to stick
around a little longer...

389
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:44,579
Don't do that to me, Wilson.

390
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,650
No, I'm not. I'm just...

391
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:52,210
I do feel pretty good,
and maybe I should try it.

392
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:54,720
For a little while.

393
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:00,891
I think that's reasonable.

394
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,435
Are you conning me?

395
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:18,837
You're conning me.

396
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:20,239
What?

397
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:24,812
Just because you folded, that
means it must be some evil plan?

398
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:29,990
Well, that's usually how it works with you.
You drown me in nostalgia,

399
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:32,926
so I'll think about our friendship
and feel some kind of loyalty,

400
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,261
and agree to more chemo.

401
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,199
Thai was real nostalgia, it was
real emotion, it's a real decision.

402
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,964
A decision that I
just made for you.

403
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,337
I need you, okay.

404
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,847
<i>I want you to be
around as long as possible,</i>

405
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,452
because I don't know
what I'm gonna do without you.

406
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,887
No! No. Don't do that

407
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,549
I don't owe you anything.

408
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:05,959
Our entire relationship
has been about you.

409
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,032
My dying is about me.

410
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:01,182
Look at you.
You don't wanna die.

411
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,008
Of course, I don't wanna die.

412
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,678
Then fight.

413
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,381
I did. I tried.

414
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:07,615
One time.

415
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,090
House, get out of my car.

416
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,750
You don't have to
just accept this.

417
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:14,126
Yes, I do have to accept this.
I have five months to live.

418
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,733
And you're making me
go through this alone?

419
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:27,240
I'm pissed because I'm dying.
That's not fair.

420
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,300
And I need...

421
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,237
I need a friend.

422
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:35,116
I need to know that
you're there. I need...

423
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:42,655
I need you to tell me
that my life was worthwhile.

424
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:48,661
And I need you to
tell me that you love me.

425
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:00,432
No.

426
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,974
I'm not gonna tell you
that unless you fight.

427
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,954
Blood vessels are non-reactive.
It's not a migraine.

428
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,024
<i>I'm not feeling so great,
how much longer?</i>

429
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,660
Finishing up.

430
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:34,633
Thank you, Dr. Adams.

431
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,315
It looks like
the ceiling might...

432
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:23,654
What are you doing back here?

433
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,492
We got a case. I assume the
status is patient's getting worse

434
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,997
you guys are confused.

435
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,928
You think actually
showing up for work

436
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,264
is enough to make up
for ruining an MRI?

437
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,839
Endangering the patient,
injuring us?

438
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,000
I've got an airtight
alibi that I'm working on.

439
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,509
This isn't about the damage
You're back

440
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,044
because something's
going on with Wilson.

441
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,440
I'm done with Wilson.

442
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,340
What does that mean,
you're done with Wilson?

443
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,543
If he's not dead,
you're not done with Wilson.

444
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:49,176
Suddenly, you think you're
gonna make a difference?

445
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,848
You can't just abandon him.

446
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,046
It's in his hands now.
Did you get

447
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:55,215
any good pictures
before the MRI drowned?

448
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,588
Enough to know it
wasn't a migraine.

449
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,957
And the patient
mistook me for Adams.

450
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:10,801
Come with me.

451
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,306
He?'

452
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:18,540
So what do you
think's gonna happen

453
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,276
when I stick
a needle into his eardrum?

454
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:21,578
You quizzing us?

455
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,051
This is a good quiz.

456
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,585
He'll scream in pain.

457
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:25,713
Don'! listen to her.

458
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,552
Very small needle,
very steady hands.

459
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:30,557
Now, when I pull
back on the plunger,

460
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:31,992
what do you think
is gonna come out?

461
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,151
Air.

462
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,297
Boy, that air sure is red.

463
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,329
Persistent Stapedial Artery.

464
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,500
It should disappear
in the embryonic stage.

465
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,578
But just like his dead brother,
he really can't let go.

466
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,444
So the artery's been pressing against
the temporal lobe of his brain,

467
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:53,574
right above the ear canal.

468
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,811
Explains the voices,
the dizziness, everything.

469
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,079
Now you guys can explain how
we're gonna make him better.

470
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,153
Will my brother's
voice go away?

471
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,967
You're being an ass.

472
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,842
I just cured a patient.
How about you'?

473
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,341
You can't just
give up on Wilson.

474
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,104
You know he needs you.

475
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,778
You know he's making
an impossible choice.

476
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:25,280
He just doesn't
want to live in pain.

477
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,010
Life is pain.

478
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,684
I wake up every morning and I'm in pain.
I go to work in pain.

479
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,618
You know how many times
I've wanted to just give up?

480
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,782
How many times
I've thought about ending it?

481
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:04,183
You here to yell at me,
or give me hockey tickets?

482
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,880
Had to delay the surgery
because our patient

483
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:07,684
drank ammonia from
the janitor's cart.

484
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,221
I guess he didn't want to live
without his brother's voice.

485
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:19,366
Where are you going?

486
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,405
You can't wait to die?

487
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,268
Here, lei me help you.

488
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:31,870
Hey! Hey!
House!

489
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,004
House!

490
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,040
See? You wanna live.

491
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,084
He did something stupid.
He's not gonna do it again.

492
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:40,952
You're resisting me because it's our
human responsibility to stay alive!

493
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:43,583
You've made your point, House!
Stop!

494
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:59,240
You've spent your whole life
looking for the truth.

495
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:02,107
Well, sometimes,
the truth just sucks.

496
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,441
Um, um...

497
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:16,625
I'm going to be leaving, uh... Quite a
bit earlier than we had talked about.

498
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,794
Next day or two.

499
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:24,761
What happened?

500
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:26,427
Something
between you and House?

501
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,467
He's not my child.

502
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:37,840
I cannot be responsible for the
happiness of Gregory House.

503
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,811
I'll give these to Frankel.

504
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,142
Okay, thank you.

505
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:49,516
And you are responsible.

506
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:57,826
The past 20 years,
you've had three wives,

507
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,767
hundreds of colleagues,
thousands of patients.

508
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,506
But you've kept
that one best friend.

509
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:12,045
He wants me to suffer a misery that I don'!
Want to go through.

510
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:18,679
Chemo won't make
your life any better.

511
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:20,984
But caring will.

512
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:25,358
Enduring pain to do some good
for someone you care about.

513
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,628
Isn't that what life is?

514
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:42,894
Mom.

515
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,031
Yeah?

516
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:50,603
That picture of Christopher
that I had on the stand,

517
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:53,807
did you take it?

518
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,609
Yes.

519
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,317
Did you throw it out?

520
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,959
If I agree to get this surgery,

521
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:08,928
can you bring
that picture back?

522
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,297
House.
Not home.

523
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,965
I'm ready to start
the next round of chemo.

524
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:57,336
Why?

525
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,047
Because you need me.

526
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:05,118
And I don't think
that's a bad thing anymore.

527
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,547
No.

528
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:14,793
You're the only
one I listen to.

529
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:18,027
And the last couple of days, I didn't.
I almost killed my patient.

530
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,669
So I think it's
time for me to accept

531
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:25,470
that you're just
smarter than I am.

532
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:32,243
Are you really okay that
there's only five months left?

533
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,139
No.

534
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:38,716
But it's better than nothing.

535
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,048
Um...

536
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,754
How do we start?

537
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,594
Well, I'm not gonna say,
"I love you."

538
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,425
Thank God. Got any Oreos?

539
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,222
Hey. How you feeling?

540
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,560
The surgery worked.

541
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,921
How can you tell'?

542
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:25,934
Because Christopher's gone.

543
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:34,364
And this is the peak.
Almost 8,000 feet.

544
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:39,303
You do realize that my leg situation
has deteriorated a little

545
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:40,843
since the last
time we went hiking.

546
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:42,343
So add another day.

547
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,781
This is Matt Johnson,
the hospital lawyer.

548
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,487
Yes, I have decided
not to proceed

549
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,490
with the sexual
harassment case.

550
00:41:58,116 --> 00:41:59,117
Are these yours?

551
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:04,229
The plumber retrieved them from
the hospital outflow pipe.

552
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:07,565
They caused the sewage back up
that ruined the MRI.

553
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,035
And they have
your name on them.

554
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:14,008
Gregory Danger House?
It's a very common name.

555
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:16,705
These apparently have your
finger prints on them also.

556
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,847
Okay, well, why don't you
tell me how many hours

557
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,749
of picking up trash
you want me to do?

558
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:26,649
House, I tried to
keep this internal.

559
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:30,220
The fire department handed
the tickets to the police,

560
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,085
who contacted
your parole officer.

561
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,094
It's felony vandalism.

562
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,761
He's gonna revoke your parole.

563
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:39,861
There's nothing we can do.

564
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:41,834
You have to report to Mercer
County Jail on Monday

565
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,736
to serve out
the rest of your sentence.

566
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:53,747
And that's how long?

567
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,084
I'm sorry.
How long?

568
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:06,424
Six months.
