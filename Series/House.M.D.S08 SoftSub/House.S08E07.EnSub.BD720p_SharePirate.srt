1
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:18,854
The Patuxent River
Naval Air Station near DC

2
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:23,401
was commissioned in 1943
by John McCain's grandfather.

3
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,365
I'm thinking of
going hang-gliding.

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,963
Pax River's,
like, completely flat.

5
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,976
I think that's why they tested
the V-22 Osprey there.

6
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,545
I like naval stuff.

7
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,379
I like their oranges and lint.

8
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:42,386
What looks like kidney disease but isn't?
And where's Chase?

9
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:45,320
Root canal and Berger's. The
first one was regarding Chase,

10
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,519
root canal, if done correctly,
doesn't look like kidney disease.

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,822
Got a case for you.

12
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,190
Smells funny.

13
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,890
Patient had an idiopathic
anaphylactic reaction,

14
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:57,832
stumped two ER docs and an
immunologist from Johns Hopkins.

15
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:00,838
Patient went from asymptomatic to
fried kidneys in less than a year,

16
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,531
stumped three internists and a
department chair from Harvard.

17
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,905
Fourteen-year-old girl,
intermittent attacks.

18
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,276
Four-year-old boy,
consistently at death's door.

19
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:18,683
This patient
died five years ago.

20
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,558
Didn't say which side
of the door he was on.

21
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,227
The fact that he's dead
makes it more interesting.

22
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,461
Four-year-olds do
not die of Berger's.

23
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,868
I thought it was relevant.

24
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,070
Death is a consequence,
not a symptom,

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,373
and if it's not a symptom,
it's not relevant.

26
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,152
Shouldn't we be trying to
maximize what we can save here?

27
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,243
The 14-year-old.
Your freedom, our asses...

28
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,218
Right. Save your asses.

29
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:34,096
She was in a car
accident when she was two.

30
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,492
She only had minor injuries
but her father died.

31
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,194
That was 12 years ago.
You think that's pertinent?

32
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,168
No, I think it's sad.

33
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:45,304
She got sick in the middle
of her 14th birthday party.

34
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,173
Which is sad and pertinent.

35
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,804
Maybe she was opening a present
that triggered the reaction.

36
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,938
Where's House? Pissing
contest with Foreman.

37
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,675
Last thing she ate
was strawberry cake

38
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,481
but allergy tests for
everything were negative.

39
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,488
You like your dentist? I'm still
going to my pediatric one.

40
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,785
What's your dentist's name?

41
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:02,787
Williams.

42
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,055
But what if it's not
an allergic reaction?

43
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,892
Hereditary angioedema
or systemic

44
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,794
mastocytosis could
mimic anaphylaxis.

45
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,664
You're not sure of his name?
You just saw him this morning.

46
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,999
The assistant's name is Angie
her home number is...

47
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:17,199
Normal complement studies,
no skin lesions.

48
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,176
You had a manicure. This is fresh.
You weren't at the dentist.

49
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,735
Why would you lie about that?

50
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,038
To avoid having
this conversation.

51
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,047
Elevated BP What
about pheochromocytoma?

52
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,914
Or an anaphylactoid reaction, which
could be triggered by certain opioids.

53
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:30,511
You've had your haircut three
times since I've met you.

54
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,056
You can't be embarrassed
about a manicure.

55
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,681
There's got to be
a deeper reason.

56
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:34,987
Did House give you homework?

57
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,354
She's not on any meds.

58
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,723
Haven't you heard?
Everybody lies.

59
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,058
And the tox screen was clean.

60
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,822
Feel free to
jump in at any time.

61
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,499
We'll check
catecholamines for pheo

62
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,333
and run an expanded
opioid panel.

63
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,998
You see what
the patient says about

64
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,700
drug use when her
mother's out of the room.

65
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,505
No. Never.

66
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:56,706
Nobody's here to
bust you, Iris,

67
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,750
we just need to know if...
No. I already told you.

68
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,078
I just take
vitamin C sometimes.

69
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,279
What exactly were you doing
when you had your reaction?

70
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,922
Opening a birthday present.
The Magic 8-Ball.

71
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,959
The joke gift, not the cocaine.
Is that it?

72
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:17,361
Certain drugs could
explain her reaction.

73
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,365
What kind of drugs?

74
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,100
What kind did you have in mind?

75
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,712
Iris has always
been a moody girl,

76
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,750
and now that she's a teenager,
it's gotten worse.

77
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:36,082
So for the past few months, I've
been giving something to relax her.

78
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:39,056
Diazepam. I tell her
it's vitamin C.

79
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,758
Being normal is
very important to Iris.

80
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,262
She couldn't handle
the thought of being on meds.

81
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,798
Anti-anxiety medications
would explain it.

82
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,236
If we keep her off, she'll
be moody but healthy.

83
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,165
Or ifs something else.

84
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,939
A patient with you.

85
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,641
I thought you had
a team for that.

86
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,947
According to Foreman,
they're only

87
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,316
for DDxing people
who are still alive.

88
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,022
You have a dead patient?

89
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,189
Bigotry is born
when we add modifiers.

90
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,691
I don't see creed,
color, pulse.

91
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,596
Foreman will find out you're taking
this case and he'll bust you.

92
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,330
But you know that,
which means...

93
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:30,338
You want to go back to jail

94
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,171
because it's the one place

95
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,940
you're unable to indulge
your self-destructive habits.

96
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,676
Yeah. It's much more likely
that I'm taking this case

97
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,613
because I miss showering
with Cro-Magnons,

98
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,348
than I actually happen
to find it interesting.

99
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,219
Four-year-old kid.

100
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:51,389
His kidneys died, they transfused,
his lungs died, he died.

101
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,721
<i>Have you seen
Bride of the Monster?</i>

102
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,356
I just got the Ed Wood box set.

103
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,957
What if the chicken
was the egg?

104
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,536
What if the lung
involvement came first?

105
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,161
I don't really
care about the movie,

106
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,863
I just don't want
to indulge your...

107
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,564
Lupus.

108
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,301
Because this is
a bad idea, House.

109
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,646
If the kid had a rash
or some circulation issue...

110
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,978
Damn!

111
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,818
Sorry. Just realized I'm late
for my anger management class.

112
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,490
Traffic, for sure.

113
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,390
- Taxes.
- Definitely taxes.

114
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,656
Spoiled grandchildren.

115
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,059
Platitudes.

116
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:31,829
Any others?

117
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,667
And I lose my temper
when someone suggests

118
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,899
that a handful of
pop-psych catchphrases

119
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:39,239
can control our most seminal,
intractable

120
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:42,677
and natural
reaction to a dead child.

121
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,179
Am I right, Emory?

122
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,624
I don't think Emory
wants to share right now.

123
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,558
They blew it, didn't they?
They missed your son's rash.

124
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,296
A faint one, on his cheek.

125
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,864
He didn't have a rash.

126
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,626
I think we should talk about
Lena's grandchildren.

127
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,861
They're alive.

128
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,696
Was he sensitive to sunlight?
No.

129
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,397
Greg.
Cold fingers and toes'?

130
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,632
No!

131
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,248
Wegener's granulomatosis.
I need to examine your son.

132
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,387
You're a bit late
for that, you ass.

133
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,550
With you and
your wife's consent,

134
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,387
we could get
an exhumation order.

135
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,993
Find out what killed him.

136
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:35,464
Ex-wife and you'll
never get her consent.

137
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,557
She's moved on,
new hub, new kid.

138
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,637
She wants nothing to
do with Drew's death.

139
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,932
Or me.

140
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,571
You're angry
because your kid died.

141
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,077
More than that, because
you don't have an answer.

142
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,076
People need answers.

143
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,993
He's in a crypt at
St. Jude's Cemetery.

144
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,294
You feeling
any pain or cramp in here?

145
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,462
A bit.

146
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,102
But not just there. Um...

147
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,107
Here.

148
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:21,006
Breast tenderness. Have you been
having regular periods, Iris?

149
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,774
Not really.

150
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,305
What is it?

151
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,508
I think we should
run a pregnancy test.

152
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:31,451
Iris isn't sexually active. She
doesn't even have a boyfriend.

153
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,354
Pregnancy would explain
all of her symptoms,

154
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,824
can even cause some unpredictable
allergic reactions.

155
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,293
How can I be pregnant
if I've never even had sex?

156
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,159
We just need to
draw a bit of blood.

157
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,069
What's the matter?

158
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,694
My arms.

159
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,975
I can't feel my arms.

160
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,912
At this rate, I'm gonna need
to pick out a plot for myself.

161
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,820
Thanks to your generous
donation, you have all morning.

162
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,860
More like 13 minutes.

163
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,759
Before we proceed any further,
Doctor, I'd like to inquire

164
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:17,824
as to exactly what procedure you
intend to perform on the remains.

165
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:22,538
You ever heard of the North American
Man Dead Boy Love Association?

166
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,545
I consider these
grounds to be a holy place

167
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,341
and I would ask you to observe
them with due decorum.

168
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:35,012
So you're taking bribes to plunder
graves and I need to show respect.

169
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,047
I think they got
the cause of death wrong

170
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:44,123
and if I find a hole in the cartilage
of his nose, right about here,

171
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,356
then it means I'm right.

172
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,858
Please be respectful.

173
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,408
I have prepared
the sarcophagus for you.

174
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,607
Thank you, Igor.

175
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,205
It's Milton.

176
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,758
You owe me a new pair of pants.

177
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:00,605
<i>She is pregnant.
Test came back positive.</i>

178
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,267
So she lost the use of her
arms and her innocence.

179
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:10,539
A vengeful god or...

180
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:12,515
<i>Cerebral tumor.</i>

181
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,709
Vasculitis.

182
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,978
MS.

183
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,826
I gather from the silence
that Chase isn't there.

184
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,625
No, I'm here.
Where are you?

185
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,792
<i>"Nowhere, ”
he said cryptically.</i>

186
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,734
<i>I assume you concur
with the diagnosis.</i>

187
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,469
Absolutely.

188
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,873
<i>Even though there
are three diagnoses.</i>

189
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:42,845
<i>And MS and vasculitis usually
get better with pregnancy.</i>

190
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,844
Yeah. I was saying I agreed
with the other one.

191
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,315
He's had his eyebrows waxed.

192
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,217
<i>I met a woman who
likes her men well-groomed.</i>

193
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,653
All over?

194
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:58,493
I assume from the silence that
Chase has had a Brazilian.

195
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,761
Cool.
Interesting.

196
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:01,923
Ouch.

197
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:12,343
The question is'
is this really about a woman,

198
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,078
<i>or is it about
something more profound?</i>

199
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:17,114
Another question is, could the
paraesthesia be caused by an STD?

200
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:20,509
<i>HIV-related
mononeuritis multiplex.</i>

201
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:27,385
I gather from the silence that
either you all agree with Chase

202
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,255
or you're just staring
at his emasculated brow.

203
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:35,857
In either case, test for HIV and
do an MRI to rule out tumors.

204
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,398
And check Chase
for testosterone.

205
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:03,058
Bloodwork was negative for HIV.
All the money's on tumor.

206
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,763
How was the Brazilian?

207
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,888
It was fine. Hurt a bit.

208
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,264
What about House's theory?
Why'd you really do it?

209
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,393
Because I'm vain and shallow.
And you weren't before?

210
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,305
The girl I was seeing wasn't.
There's nothing profound here.

211
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,968
No tumor either.
It's not her brain.

212
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,682
Everything looks good.

213
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,912
What's the matter?
My arms.

214
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,854
Still nothing?
No. Now they're sore.

215
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,181
The paraesthesia's gone.

216
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,427
Could the bruising be
caused by physical trauma?

217
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,996
You think she fell
out of bed repeatedly?

218
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,599
A blood disorder,
maybe thrombocytopenia?

219
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,973
A vitamin K
deficiency or scurvy

220
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,340
could explain bleeding problems

221
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,346
and pregnancy
could exacerbate it.

222
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:01,351
Boys, do a home search,
girls, do the lab tests.

223
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,853
I'm pretty sure
that's not sexist.

224
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,945
Where've you been?

225
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,857
Picking up dry cleaning, filling
up the tank, violating the dead.

226
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,352
If you don't believe me,
call the monitoring company.

227
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,556
I did.

228
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,629
Unfortunately,
the Patuxent River

229
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,531
Naval Air
Station was GPS testing

230
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,296
and disrupted the signal

231
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,896
at the exact same 45 minutes
you weren't here.

232
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,803
If I'd known I had
45 minutes of freedom,

233
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,638
I would have
gone hang-gliding.

234
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:27,973
I admire the creativity.

235
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,378
But what happens
when the stunt doesn't work?

236
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,547
You think you're gonna
have to pay off a bet?

237
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,652
You think I'm gonna
triple your clinic hours?

238
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,086
I'm gonna call your PO and
you're gonna go back to jail.

239
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,856
There are Mees lines
on his fingernails,

240
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,558
so now I'm thinking
heavy metal poisoning.

241
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,668
You're an addict
And I'm an idiot

242
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,103
for thinking that your
addictions were limited

243
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,572
to pills, anti-social
behavior and sarcasm.

244
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,836
Sorry.
Vicodin repeating on me.

245
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,679
You're also
addicted to puzzles.

246
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,746
You show all
the classic behaviors,

247
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,942
lying,
neglecting responsibilities,

248
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,679
and you can't stop no matter how
devastating the consequences.

249
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,881
Working on
a medical case is not

250
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,184
a parole violation,
it's my job description.

251
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:17,692
Your job description is doing
what Foreman tells you to do.

252
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,290
<i>Never mind Bride of the Monster,
you need to watch Norma Rae.</i>

253
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,194
Before we get started,
I just want to

254
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,463
thank you all for
agreeing to relocate.

255
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,096
I had an appointment
in this part of town

256
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:30,606
and I obviously didn't
want to miss this meeting.

257
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:34,072
But thank you. I'm buying.

258
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,237
Not literally.

259
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,614
Hey, Emory,
shall we powder our noses?

260
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:49,051
Hey, did you know your ex-wife still
lives right behind this place?

261
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:56,156
She finishes work at 4:00,
picks up her new kid at 4:15.

262
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,394
Gives us about 20 minutes.

263
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,401
I made some calls.

264
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:05,637
It's amazing what people will tell
you if you ask rudely enough.

265
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,475
Was that table here?

266
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,917
Some kinds of pressure-treated
wood can contain arsenic.

267
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,418
We shouldn't be here.

268
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,353
We don't have a choice.

269
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,493
This is the only way
I'm gonna get your answer.

270
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,960
Does your ex leave
a spare key anywhere?

271
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:28,958
How did he look?

272
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,367
Peaceful.

273
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,773
Vitamin K deficiency's a bust.

274
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,818
Fridge has more spinach and
broccoli than a farmers' market.

275
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:51,151
The Brazilian,
you said it hurt a bit.

276
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,121
You've had one? More than one.
And you haven't.

277
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,218
They hurt all your bits.

278
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,722
That's my dark secret.
What's yours?

279
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,998
I had the nails and eyebrows
done but that's it.

280
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,230
I just needed to
create a distraction.

281
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,704
I met a TV
producer at a dinner,

282
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,537
she asked me to appear
on their medical segment.

283
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,376
I screen tested it
yesterday and shot it today.

284
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:18,074
You're a TV doctor?

285
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,207
It's a one-off.
When did it air?

286
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:24,151
Two hours ago otherwise
I'd still be lying.

287
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:29,391
This is what she was opening
when she had her attack.

288
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:32,554
Will anyone believe Chase
is an actual doctor?

289
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,096
"Don't count on it."

290
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,546
She does have a boyfriend.

291
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,237
Love letters.

292
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,582
- Porn?
- The nasty kind.

293
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:59,179
Torture, rape, animals.

294
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,550
Sweet kid.

295
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,334
This is all that's left.

296
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,806
One box in
the bottom of a closet.

297
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,559
He used to wear those
stupid things all the time.

298
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:24,232
I used to have to
pretend I was scared.

299
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,860
Made in the People's
Republic of Lead Paint.

300
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:30,868
Back door.

301
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:35,506
Let's get out of here first. Need
to catch the end of our class.

302
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,420
I met him at school.

303
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,850
He was the only
boy that liked me.

304
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,460
It's a little more than like.

305
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:52,560
We haven't had sex.

306
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:55,231
Oh, come on,
Iris, you're pregnant.

307
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,765
So I'm just lying
about everything?

308
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,631
Well, you lied about
the boyfriend,

309
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:03,867
you obviously lied about
sex and this garbage.

310
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:06,375
They're his. He can't
keep them at his place.

311
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,943
Well, I'm glad we could
be so accommodating.

312
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,379
What else don't I know?

313
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,589
Honey.

314
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,552
What is it?

315
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,396
He came here last night,
and he told me I should leave.

316
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:35,736
But I didn't want
to and he got mad.

317
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,472
He hit you?
Physical trauma.

318
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,102
Explains the negatives
for the blood disorders.

319
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,305
We should call the police.

320
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,905
I won't tell them anything.

321
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,580
That's ridiculous, he beat you.

322
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,251
What is it?

323
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,794
It's getting hard to see.

324
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,930
What the hell is
happening to me?

325
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,433
Rubbing alcohol, vinegar...

326
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:13,099
Not sure what this is.

327
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,942
Aren't there
actual medical tests?

328
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:18,805
Dead patients usually get
a lower standard of care.

329
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:25,286
Pink means lead, orange means
mercury and rust means arsenic.

330
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:27,288
What's brown mean?

331
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,153
Scotch.

332
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,826
He used to call him Deezer.

333
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:13,360
He couldn't say "zebra."

334
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:17,497
Made up his own words for everything.
We called them Drewisms.

335
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:24,005
How does your ex-wife do it?

336
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:29,342
How come she's not
angry and miserable?

337
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:36,123
She treated it like
it never happened.

338
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,017
She never even cried.

339
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,388
Not even at his funeral.

340
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:46,032
I was a mess and she
just sat there like

341
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:50,032
a statue.

342
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,140
We have a problem.

343
00:23:58,537 --> 00:23:59,948
Does it limp?

344
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,079
Why do you care if
he works on two cases?

345
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,715
Because next it'll be
three cases, then four,

346
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:13,627
then animal cases and ghost
cases, then animal-ghost cases.

347
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,960
Assuming, of course,
we are talking about House.

348
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:18,331
You're just setting
yourself up to fail.

349
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:21,098
He has a lot more to lose than I do.
And he knows that.

350
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,603
He's rational.

351
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:23,898
No, he's not.

352
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:26,840
He's the most rational man I've ever met.
Annoyingly so.

353
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,811
He's not gonna put himself
back in jail over a dead kid.

354
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,006
He's an addict

355
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:34,676
And he will put himself
back in jail over a puzzle.

356
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,011
He'll back down.

357
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:45,251
Halfway through the perimetry exam,
her tunnel vision went away.

358
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,522
- She could see perfectly.
- TIA.

359
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,664
The word "transient"
is right there in the name.

360
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:54,965
Ah. Here we go.

361
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:01,874
<i>Shazza, after giving
the pics an eye or two,</i>

362
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:05,141
<i>I can confirm that Lauren's surgeries
cost her some big bikkies.</i>

363
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,877
<i>Not only was there a gut tuck,
nose tuck, and arse tuck,</i>

364
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:12,285
<i>but her new fake norks stick
out like nuts on a mutt.</i>

365
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,287
The original script wasn't...

366
00:25:15,288 --> 00:25:16,655
<i>Anyone notice Brad's</i>

367
00:25:16,656 --> 00:25:18,787
<i>- cossie fitting a little bit snugger?
- He's enlightening us.</i>

368
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,227
<i>That's 'cause
he's retooled the ol' todger.</i>

369
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,630
<i>Let's just hope no one cut the
wrong wire, eh?</i>

370
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:30,499
So you just wanted
to look pretty on TV?

371
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,631
Question is,
why did he want that?

372
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,066
Clinic time.

373
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,200
What do you want us to do?

374
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,213
M RA for TIA.

375
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,907
ROFL.

376
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:42,584
Thought you only had
clinic on Tuesdays.

377
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,482
Oh, you're right.

378
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,359
Hi. I'm here for the free flu shot.
I got a call saying...

379
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,827
And I'm here to find out why you
didn't care about your first kid.

380
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,826
Losing a child, you just
breezed right through it.

381
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,328
What do you know
about my first kid?

382
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:01,405
Couldn't even squeeze out a
single tear at the funeral.

383
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,234
Where are you getting this?
Couldn't wait to squeeze out

384
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,274
a brand new replacement kid.

385
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,376
Damn it.

386
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:11,674
You had no right to say that

387
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:13,009
I know. I deserved the slap.

388
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:15,743
But I was hoping that you
weren't capable of ii.

389
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:17,684
Apathetic hyperthyroidism.

390
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:22,015
Could have kidney involvement, could
be genetic, definitely causes apathy.

391
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,454
I was hoping that
your lack of emotion

392
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:28,965
was a symptom of something you
could've passed on to your first son.

393
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,460
You know Emory.

394
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:34,602
We belong to the same club.

395
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:37,299
He wants to
relive this, I don't.

396
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:39,136
So I heard.

397
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,877
Emory was a wonderful man.

398
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,083
Never afraid to
show his emotions.

399
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,919
Which is great most of the
time but when Drew died,

400
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,391
it overwhelmed him.

401
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,893
I vowed I wouldn't
let that happen to me.

402
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,396
That's why you left him?

403
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:03,831
I left because of his eyes.

404
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,732
He had Drew's eyes.

405
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,499
Who used to babysit Drew?

406
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,401
My father, but...
His place or yours?

407
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,982
There are two types of people.

408
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:22,984
Those who can move on
and those who can't.

409
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:26,522
My father keeps up a good front
but he's just like Emory.

410
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:28,819
You need to leave him alone.

411
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:31,588
So he has two types of
people inside of him.

412
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,465
MRI was normal.

413
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:44,665
Yeah...

414
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,367
I found out where
your boyfriend lives.

415
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,372
When I paid him a visit,
he took off,

416
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,205
ran in front of a car.

417
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:52,475
You're lying.

418
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,049
He's down in the ER right now.

419
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,345
Shut up,
you lying sack of crap!

420
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:56,714
Iris.

421
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:59,650
How do you know I'm lying?

422
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,621
How do you know
that your boyfriend is okay?

423
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,284
'Cause I'm right here,
you dick.

424
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:14,528
Iris has dissociative
identity disorder

425
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,300
also known as multiple
personality disorder.

426
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:20,576
Are you saying I'm crazy?

427
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,475
It's the mind's
response to a severe trauma.

428
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:23,842
The person
experiences something

429
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,312
that's too difficult to accept,

430
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:28,408
so they create alternate personalities
that don't have to accept it.

431
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,384
Some think it's
quite a natural reaction.

432
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,012
Iris hasn't had
any severe traumas.

433
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,418
The car accident

434
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,025
I was two.

435
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:38,059
I don't remember anything.

436
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:42,599
These personalities that I'm
supposed to have, where are they'?

437
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:44,861
They only come out when
you're afraid or anxious.

438
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,027
That's why House used
the hurt-boyfriend story.

439
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,163
But if there's no boyfriend,
where did the bruises come from?

440
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:51,703
The pregnancy?

441
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:55,178
When you say your
boyfriend hit you,

442
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,746
it means you
actually hit yourself.

443
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:03,616
And the pregnancy doesn't
take a boyfriend, just a boy.

444
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:09,558
You may not be aware of half
the things you've done.

445
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:17,857
How could this be happening to my
own daughter without me knowing it?

446
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:21,768
Diazepam was masking it. Taking
her off made it more apparent.

447
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,899
But I... I wasn't on...
Diazepam? What is that?

448
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,649
That's what those
vitamin pills were.

449
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,383
Iris, I'm so sorry.

450
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,584
I just thought you were moody.

451
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,661
I didn't want you to think
you needed medication.

452
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:53,726
Oh, my God, I can't believe
how stupid I've been.

453
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,571
We need you to help
us with something.

454
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,233
Different alters can have
different apparent symptoms,

455
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,813
allergies, paraesthesia, vision
loss, changes in blood pressure.

456
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,246
Do you think I'm
making this up?

457
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:07,908
Your symptoms are real,

458
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,453
but some are physiological
and others are psychological.

459
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:12,785
So there's something
wrong with her

460
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,255
in addition to the
multiple personalities'?

461
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:18,654
Yes, but we won't know what
until we access her alters

462
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,457
and compare their symptoms.

463
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,758
How do you do that?

464
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,592
Hypnosis.

465
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,104
Foreman's not gonna back down.

466
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,604
He's not an idiot.
Yes, he is.

467
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:35,645
Just like you. If you keep being
stubborn, he will keep being stubborn.

468
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,508
Eventually you will
screw something up,

469
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,445
which will be bad
news for both of you

470
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:43,384
but only one of you
will be in prison.

471
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,819
It just isn't worth it, House.

472
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:58,623
Okay.

473
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:54,424
Uh... Yes, sir.
Yes, I know I told you

474
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:57,119
that I had a chiropractor's
appointment,

475
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,126
but I got a flat.

476
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,062
I know, right?

477
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:05,794
So, don't send out the Marines.

478
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,231
I should be back on the
road in a few minutes.

479
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,404
Okay. bye...

480
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:17,779
Dr. James Wilson,
county coroner.

481
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:21,407
I'd like to ask you about
your grandson, Drew Lemaine.

482
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,564
What did he do
when he was here?

483
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:40,568
Where did he play?
What did he eat'?

484
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:45,106
We watched a lot of TV.
And ate biscuits.

485
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,910
Did you give him sidewalk chalk?
No.

486
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,740
- Fingerpaints?
- No.

487
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,177
A sandbox?

488
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:56,844
Like I said,
we watched a lot of TV.

489
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,582
You expecting someone?

490
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,250
What?

491
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:11,599
Dr. Wilson, my ass.

492
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,761
I told you to leave him alone,
you son of a bitch!

493
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:15,700
Temper trigger!

494
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,433
Who am I talking to now?

495
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:23,944
Nobody.

496
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:27,883
You must be somebody.

497
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:29,543
I'm too little.

498
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,279
Nobody sees me.

499
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,621
Nobody knows I'm here.

500
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:38,194
BP just went to 140 over 90.

501
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,725
What is it?

502
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,127
My arms.

503
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,631
You can't feel them?

504
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,628
Ifs okay, we can fix that.

505
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,874
Do you hurt anywhere else?

506
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,499
Not right now.

507
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:56,343
But you used to hurt?

508
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:59,407
When I eat strawberries.

509
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,318
And when I remember...

510
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,048
You remember being hurt?

511
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,861
I remember everything.

512
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,712
Baby...

513
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:34,339
It's going to be okay.

514
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,769
Iris, why didn't
you ever tell me?

515
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,543
It was my fault Daddy died.

516
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:09,379
Oh, no.

517
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:12,715
Yes, it was. I was crying
and he couldn't drive.

518
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,552
It was my fault Daddy died.

519
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,454
Oh, no. No, no, honey.

520
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:19,586
You were just a baby.
It wasn't your fault. No...

521
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,830
It was my fault.
I'm sorry, Mommy.

522
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,400
Poor baby.

523
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,792
I'm so sorry.

524
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:44,478
It wasn't a miscarriage. Tests
show she's still pregnant.

525
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,649
Okay, cross out everything that
doesn't appear in every alter.

526
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,926
When she opened
the Magic 8-Ball,

527
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,794
it triggered a switch to a personality
with a strawberry allergy.

528
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,127
Pregnancy, vaginal bleeding
and elevated BP.

529
00:35:58,256 --> 00:35:59,530
Could be a preeclampsia.

530
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:00,966
Worst case, could be
an ectopic pregnancy.

531
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,470
We need to ultrasound.

532
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,977
Not seeing an embryo
in the fallopian tube.

533
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:17,276
Not seeing an embryo anywhere.

534
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,889
<i>Which idiot did
the pregnancy test?</i>

535
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:23,050
I did one of them. Chase did
another, Taub did a third.

536
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:25,321
Three tests, three positives.

537
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,485
What happened to your eye'?

538
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,656
I grabbed Park's ass.

539
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,459
Exoplanets.

540
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,500
- I think he said exoplanets.
- Wait for it.

541
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:38,665
We can't actually see them,
but we infer their existence

542
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:40,868
because of the effect they
have on the star they orbit.

543
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,468
Pregnancy test only
infers an embryo's existence

544
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:46,081
because of elevated hCG levels.

545
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:48,048
Which could also be caused
by choriocarcinoma,

546
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,585
which affects the placenta,
mimics pregnancy,

547
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,586
and causes elevated BP
and vaginal bleeding.

548
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,588
Occult choriocarcinoma,
which is why

549
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,659
we didn't see it
on the ultrasound.

550
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,992
Tell all the alters
that they have cancer.

551
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,508
Mom or dad?

552
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:17,176
Mom, dad and mom's dad.

553
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:21,946
The good news is it made me
realize that you were right.

554
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,713
I can't drop it.

555
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,020
But now that I accept that,
I feel much less conflicted.

556
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:31,922
I've ruled out Wegener's, Berger's,
heavy-metal poisoning...

557
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,620
Two trains are about to collide

558
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,390
and I'm trying to
talk them out of it.

559
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:36,727
I still think I'm
missing something.

560
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:38,392
No, no. You don't
want to listen to me,

561
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,127
then I don't want
to listen to you.

562
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,761
That is so fifth grade.

563
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,463
I agree. And you know why?

564
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,468
Because I'm just as bad as you.

565
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,065
I knew this would
fall on deaf ears

566
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:49,442
but I just kept
talking and talking.

567
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,407
You're right.

568
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,381
You don't even
know what I just said.

569
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:57,950
That is ridiculous.

570
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,223
You said, "Blah, blah, blah,
deaf ears, blah, blah, blah."

571
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,219
Absolutely
essential information.

572
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:20,933
Ray! Ray!

573
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:24,336
Leave him alone!
What are you doing to him?

574
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,006
It's okay.

575
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:27,913
Mickey.

576
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,178
You? You brought him?

577
00:38:29,274 --> 00:38:31,686
I asked him to meet me here
for a family reunion.

578
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:32,914
Ray!

579
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,680
Let's just get
out of here, okay?

580
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,019
I know what killed your son.

581
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:37,957
You don't get it, do you?
I don't care what killed him!

582
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,427
It's called Alport syndrome.

583
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:42,257
It's a genetic condition
characterized by kidney failure,

584
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,460
bronchial myomas,
Mees lines and deafness.

585
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,196
Idiot, Drew wasn't deaf.

586
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,468
Son of a bitch!
Get away from them!

587
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,102
House. House!

588
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:52,470
It's a genetic condition.

589
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,532
Shut up!
Genetic.

590
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,009
Your father has
the gene and so do you.

591
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:05,049
It was Grandpa's slight deafness
that gave the game away.

592
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:07,350
You're apparently asymptomatic,

593
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:10,790
but you still passed the
gene on to your children.

594
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:12,185
Plural.

595
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,857
You're lying.

596
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:27,800
He has high frequency hearing
impairment and so did Drew.

597
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,005
That's why Drew
made up his own words,

598
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:32,173
'cause he couldn't
hear properly.

599
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:38,714
Ifs okay. Now that
we know what it is,

600
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,347
he'll need treatment
but he'll live.

601
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,096
You know, there are platitudes
that can help you with that.

602
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:20,755
I miss him, too.

603
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,160
She's responding well.

604
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,655
Cuddy threatened
him with clinic duty.

605
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:22,350
I thought threatening him
with jail would be different.

606
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,857
Not an irrational thought.

607
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,188
I'm still sending him back.

608
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:31,092
He saved two lives.

609
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,294
Which means it's too late
for me to back down.

610
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:34,828
It's no longer my choice.

611
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:37,668
It's just me telling him he
can get away with anything.

612
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,710
I have to send him to prison.

613
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:53,888
Your job is to keep
this machine running.

614
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:58,723
It's your choice to make House a
useful tool or a monkey wrench.

615
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:01,353
Cuddy's way didn't fail.

616
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:05,025
Because she didn't try to
control House, she managed him.

617
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:11,534
And she knew better than anybody
what a tool he could be.

618
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:45,601
What would Cuddy have done?

619
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,940
Ten clinic hours.

620
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,013
Cuddy's not here anymore.

621
00:42:58,109 --> 00:42:59,884
You've got 30.
