1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,041
Get up, House.

2
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,176
Must be some mistake.

3
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:13,656
I specifically requested my wake-up
startle three hours from now.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,727
Some VIP visitor. Dean of
Medicine from your old hospital.

5
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,562
I've had dreams about this.

6
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,295
I'm gonna assume
this is another one.

7
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,473
Get up.

8
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,135
I can refuse to see
any visitor I want.

9
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:35,003
Tell the Dean that
I don't want to see her.

10
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,573
He said you'd say that

11
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:42,646
"He"?

12
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:09,710
What's the hiring policy over there?
All ass-based?

13
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,407
I can get you out of here.

14
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:15,350
Not unless that file
has a file in it.

15
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,116
Judge's order for
your immediate release.

16
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,861
I had eight months added to
my sentence two months ago.

17
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,194
The math is pretty basic.

18
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,290
We have a crisis.

19
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,270
Which is good news for you.

20
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,428
You're out tonight
on conditional parole,

21
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:38,374
the condition being that
you're employed by me at PPTH.

22
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,269
No, thanks.

23
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,207
You think it's
a good idea for me

24
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,216
to go right back
to my old life?

25
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,477
For either of us?

26
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:51,447
Your patient is
two lungs in a box.

27
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,720
It only has 12 hours left.

28
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:59,725
No pulse, no body, no ability
to answer questions.

29
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,159
It's your perfect patient.

30
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:10,006
I did pay for the room
for the whole week, but...

31
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:19,149
<i>Donor's an 18-year-old
college kid back from Hofstra.</i>

32
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,809
<i>Goes to a homecoming party
with his buddies,</i>

33
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,251
<i>hops on his motorcycle,
ends up an organ donor.</i>

34
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,584
<i>Asystole in the ER.</i>

35
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,157
<i>No pulse.
No blood circulating.</i>

36
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,089
<i>His heart, liver,
kidneys were all toast.</i>

37
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,660
<i>Surgeons had the
recipient on the table</i>

38
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,663
<i>when they realized the lungs had
increased airway resistance.</i>

39
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,256
<i>The team closed her up, put the
lungs in suspended animation.</i>

40
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:38,433
<i>Buys 24 hours to fix it,
12 of which have passed.</i>

41
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:41,505
<i>And we still have
no clue what's wrong.</i>

42
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,439
Nice painting.

43
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:55,047
Blues and greens. Calming
with a hint of nurturing.

44
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,218
Totally offsets the stench
of suffering and death.

45
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,688
Where's my patient?
We need to not talk.

46
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,456
ICU isolation room.

47
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,861
The transplant team
will meet you there

48
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,397
with updates from
the past two hours.

49
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,033
Great. Take this.

50
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,299
How about you drop it
in your office?

51
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:18,542
I completely understand and
almost respect your desire

52
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,509
to appear to be
Dean of Medicine

53
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,376
given that your title
is Dean of Medicine.

54
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:25,313
On the other hand, seriously?

55
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,488
Get this straight.

56
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,582
You break the law,
you go back to jail.

57
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,491
Scam extra Vicodin,
back to jail.

58
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:41,891
Flout my authority, make the
hospital look bad, back to jail.

59
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,825
I own you.

60
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,329
Yes, master.

61
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,503
See, that would be an example.

62
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,237
When did Cuddy leave?

63
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:00,580
She gave her notice the
day after your incident.

64
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,776
Took a job...

65
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,582
Don't need the details.

66
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,618
Ortho needed more space.

67
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,194
You're this way.

68
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,268
Where's my stuff?

69
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,862
No idea.

70
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,374
What about my team?

71
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,432
Pathetic.

72
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,772
The first thing you said to me

73
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,710
was you don't want
your old environment,

74
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,409
the fourth thing you said was,
"Where's my old environment?"

75
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:35,112
It's been a year. Taub,
Chase, Thirteen all moved on.

76
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,782
The world does that sometimes.

77
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,447
No, it doesn't.

78
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,481
Here's your new office.

79
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,322
And there's your new team.

80
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,293
Hi.

81
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,009
I'm not interested in another
department's sloppy seconds.

82
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,169
I'm not sloppy seconds...

83
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,337
It's 3:00 a.m.

84
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,304
If Foreman had
called you in from home,

85
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,145
you wouldn't have pressed clothes,
coiffed hair and make-up.

86
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,775
Which means you were already
here in the hospital.

87
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,117
Yes, I was on-call
for Neurology.

88
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:14,455
If that were true, you'd be working
right now and unavailable to help.

89
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:15,816
Which means that
you're hanging out

90
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,520
in the hospital
pretending to work.

91
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,358
Which means you're
not just a reject,

92
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:23,662
you're a cowardly reject who's trying
to hide her rejectedness from someone.

93
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:24,997
I am not a reject.

94
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,098
Then go back to Neurology.

95
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,640
I can't.

96
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,169
I punched my attending.

97
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:59,393
ARDS secondary to trauma
is our leading hypothesis.

98
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:01,670
FI02 is 93%...

99
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:02,832
Prison!

100
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,974
Sorry, I thought I heard
everyone else think that.

101
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,381
I was in prison, see?

102
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,813
It was a long time ago,
but still, you're curious.

103
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,148
Never was raped.

104
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,215
Not raped-raped.

105
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,086
Well, raped-raped but
not raped-raped-raped.

106
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:26,595
Well, now that we've got
that completely behind us...

107
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,897
I'm sorry.
Dr. House, welcome back...

108
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,669
ls there cake?

109
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,574
Any alveolar exudate?

110
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:37,869
No. Lungs are dry.

111
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,104
Well, it's not ARDS.
It's the autumn.

112
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,178
It's tick-borne
disease season.

113
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,442
Ehrlichiosis
causing bronchiolitis.

114
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:49,852
You'll appreciate that I left
the "idiots" subtextual.

115
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,945
Blood smear was clear,
and we idiots

116
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,184
treated with
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

117
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,083
- Cocaine.
- Tox screen was clean.

118
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,252
Dead men don't pee.

119
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,521
Tox screen tests for
metabolites in the urine.

120
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,426
Coke never got past the lungs.

121
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,694
Also explains
the motorcycle crash.

122
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,461
Idiots.

123
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,197
Let's get the lungs
on treatment.

124
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,605
Great idea,
unless you're wrong.

125
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:11,937
And by you, I mean me.

126
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,376
Then this treatment will
bum holes in the lungs.

127
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,207
I'd call you idiots,
but at this point,

128
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,613
I'm starting to doubt whether you
understand what I mean by the word.

129
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,709
Kato, get Black Beauty
and meet me out front.

130
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,451
We're gonna find
the dead kid's stash.

131
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,299
Since an 18-year-old
with organ donor

132
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,131
on his license is
not a cancer patient,

133
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,637
I'm figuring the recipient
is a lifetime member

134
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,230
of the Wilson
Cares Too Much Club.

135
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,809
Excellent deduction.

136
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,909
You're the reason
I'm out of the big house.

137
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,810
Doesn't quite make up
for never visiting, but...

138
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,473
Springing you
was Foreman's idea.

139
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,983
I wasn't convinced until
Simpson failed three times.

140
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,917
Amounts to the same thing,
you wanted me back.

141
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,421
See, I knew
you'd over-interpret it.

142
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,822
Strong, emotional reaction.

143
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:04,259
I guess that's what lifetime
membership gets you.

144
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,620
How's your wrist?

145
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,427
Healed, thank you.

146
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:09,925
I was wrong.

147
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,936
I went to prison
I paid the price.

148
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,663
You're a changed man.

149
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,263
I said I was wrong, I didn't
say I changed. I haven't.

150
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,464
Neither have you.
Which is why...

151
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,531
Analyze it however you like.

152
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,706
We're not friends anymore.

153
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,377
What can I do?

154
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:31,615
My chest...

155
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,856
Angina's back.

156
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,027
Upping the nitro.
Should knock it back down.

157
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,222
Sis and I were talking,
trying to figure out

158
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,458
how many hospital sleepovers we've had.

159
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,668
Definitely started with the
Great Mastectomy of 2001.

160
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,065
God, I miss my boobs.

161
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,999
They were spectacular.

162
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:57,076
Is there a chance of
locating another donor?

163
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:58,975
It's unlikely,

164
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,741
especially since
with the extent

165
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,342
of the emphysema,
she needs a double lung.

166
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,384
How you doing?

167
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,354
Better already.

168
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,385
It's a good thing that worked

169
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,259
or I was gonna
make you bring me a bottle.

170
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,402
Lighten up, Sis.

171
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,063
Least you could do is laugh
at a dying lady's jokes.

172
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,498
Your drinking wasn't funny then, okay?
And it's not funny now.

173
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,703
Because you're not dying.

174
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,174
The hospital brought in a
consultant to work on the lungs.

175
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,944
Do you know him?
Is he good?

176
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,051
He is an excellent doctor.

177
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,751
We probably shouldn't be
turning up unannounced like this.

178
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,852
Their son just died.

179
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,058
Bright side, they're
probably up weeping.

180
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:53,069
Hey, we both assaulted our bosses.
It's like we're twins.

181
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,196
I'd really
rather not discuss...

182
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,433
Okay, I'll go first.
My boss dumped me.

183
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,601
And yours, what, called
you his china doll?

184
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,771
Joked about what a crappy
deal you got for Manhattan?

185
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,315
Assumed that
you have a huge penis?

186
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,950
I have no idea
what flavor you are,

187
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,045
so I thought I'd just
cover the spread.

188
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,216
My mom's Filipino,
Dad's Korean.

189
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,385
And my boss grabbed my behind.

190
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,087
Behind what?

191
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:22,228
Oh, yeah, your...
Grabbed your tushy.

192
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,594
So now you're
pretending to be on-call

193
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,796
so that your overly
protective boyfriend

194
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,237
won't find out you got groped.

195
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,904
I don't have a boyfriend.

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,070
It's my parents.

197
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,082
If they found out what I've
done, they'd be mortified.

198
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,247
Your parents know
your call schedule?

199
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,616
I live with them.

200
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,652
Right.

201
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,855
No issues there.

202
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,619
I told you'
my son didn't do cocaine.

203
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,595
Druggies are not known
for their honesty.

204
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,092
Trust me on this one.

205
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:04,002
Mr. Weathers, I'm sure you're
right, but we need to be thorough.

206
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,941
Did your son ever
smoke marijuana?

207
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,306
He was an athlete, took real
good care of himself... Hey.

208
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,450
Take it easy.
Steve loved all that...

209
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,008
Sorry, but we're on a clock.

210
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,821
I think he's
about to throw us out.

211
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,328
Nope.

212
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,727
His son is dead.

213
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,665
The only way
that has any meaning

214
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,170
is if we fix the lungs
and transplant them.

215
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,706
It doesn't matter how
much we piss him off

216
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,138
as long as we find something.

217
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,644
So go back there, piss him
off and find something.

218
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:48,375
Do you know any of the kids
at the party with your son?

219
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,047
A bunch of
his high school buddies,

220
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,055
they'd gotten
really into poker,

221
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,394
decided to have an all-night game
in Brandon Broome's basement.

222
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:58,756
Hey...

223
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,098
I understand we're in a hurry,

224
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,066
and that he's probably
not gonna throw us out,

225
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,204
but maybe he should.

226
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:14,706
Your son isn't wearing glasses
in any of these pictures.

227
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,539
He just got them
a couple weeks ago.

228
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,950
Because he was
having headaches?

229
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,087
Answer the question
before answering the door.

230
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,357
Yeah, he was.

231
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:31,429
You're right,
he was not doing cocaine.

232
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,590
He had a brain tumor.

233
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,895
Don't bother, it's for me.

234
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,207
Turns out they monitor
these monitors.

235
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,425
Thank you, Officer.

236
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,733
I thought the bracelet
was decorative.

237
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,234
My aunt had one just like it.

238
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,327
Wait a minute.

239
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,838
You're allowed to be at the hospital,
you're allowed to go home.

240
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,066
That was made clear.

241
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,236
The dead kid's house was on
the way to my apartment,

242
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,904
assuming I got lost twice.

243
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,174
Those consultants in my office

244
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,805
are only costing
the hospital 100 bucks

245
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,144
every minute
I keep them waiting.

246
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,941
Why didn't you just tell me
what you were doing?

247
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,613
I knew you were very busy
being vaguely important.

248
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:31,951
I might have
cleared it with the cops.

249
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,013
Yeah, it's the word
"might" that bumps me.

250
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,353
I'll run it by you next time.

251
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,492
House.

252
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:45,367
Getting you out of jail was not a
popular decision with the board.

253
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,695
I need you to solve this,

254
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:50,536
and I need you to do it without making
me look like I can't control you.

255
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,541
For both our sakes.

256
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,383
Disciplinary hearing
should be fun,

257
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,115
and the subsequent lingering
black mark on your record.

258
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:07,784
I'm not worried.

259
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,164
We have to wheel
this out to the MRI.

260
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:20,800
We should probably leave
the body in the bag.

261
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,667
There's a mass in the arm.

262
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,969
Analyzing part of this tumor is
gonna be quicker than a scan.

263
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,573
So, where's the next job?

264
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,408
You worry about what
people think of you,

265
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,681
thus the carefully maintained hair,
clothes and parental secrets.

266
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,017
The only way that you're not
worried about this hearing

267
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,490
is if you don't think
there's gonna be one.

268
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,528
The only way that happens is you
leave Princeton-Plainsboro.

269
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:51,232
I had a video interview with
Chicago yesterday. It went well.

270
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,007
My money's on rhabdomyosarcoma.

271
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,244
Chicago has a great program.

272
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,937
And you're a dumb-ass.

273
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,674
Running away from home
is a time-honored tradition.

274
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,773
But you're not doing it
to flee your parents,

275
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:09,114
you're doing it
to protect them.

276
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:13,418
That's an insult to everything
teen prostitutes have worked for.

277
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,551
Time to grow up and come clean.

278
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,894
You're right.
I should just drive my car

279
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,795
into their living room
and tell them.

280
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:30,074
Didn't it turn out that he'd
stolen the hot dog cart?

281
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,133
No, borrowed. Bobby was very
insistent on that point.

282
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,641
Seems like
someone's feeling better.

283
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,380
No more chest pain.

284
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,110
I haven't heard the name
Bobby in a long time.

285
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,240
How's he doing these days?

286
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,808
I don't know,
we're not in touch.

287
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:46,045
And don't even pretend like you're
not relieved, you never liked him.

288
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:50,254
Bobby is an incredibly fun, great
guy, just not a great influence.

289
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,557
I would have gone
with colossal drunk.

290
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,929
I was gonna leave that implied,
but yes, colossal drunk.

291
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:59,162
What? It's good for a
couple to share a hobby.

292
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:04,940
Your catheter bag is empty, despite
taking in 200 cc's of fluids.

293
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,244
I'm gonna have to
dial back on the nitro.

294
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,643
Won't her chest pain come back?

295
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,236
We don't have any choice.

296
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,007
The nitro is dropping the
blood flow to your kidneys.

297
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,575
They're shutting down.

298
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,633
This is so our song.

299
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,765
My patient is running out of time.

300
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,171
Not worried.

301
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,837
My team is confirming
the diagnosis as we speak.

302
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,044
I want to be understanding.
It's your first day back...

303
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,518
See?

304
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,186
I smell empathy.

305
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,682
Just remember
all the good times.

306
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,025
Like when I gave you
that necklace

307
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,960
that you just dumped
in the ocean.

308
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,225
What were you thinking?

309
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,197
House, I haven't
forgotten our friendship.

310
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:09,136
For every good memory,
there's a slew of bad ones.

311
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,800
Come in.
Come in.

312
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,679
Paraneoplastic syndrome is out.

313
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,238
The lung donor
didn't have cancer.

314
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,317
You tell that to the tumor
that I found in his arm?

315
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,684
That mass wasn't a tumour.
It was coagulated plasma.

316
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,587
ER pumped him full of it,
IV leaked into his arm.

317
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,183
I even did a complete MRI.
No cancer anywhere.

318
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,053
We've got nothing.

319
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,232
Just 'cause it wasn't a tumor

320
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,531
doesn't mean it didn't
mess with the lungs.

321
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,402
They're reacting to
something in the plasma.

322
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:47,372
<i>But every unit of plasma can have
up to 25 contributing donors.</i>

323
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,743
We'd need to
track down all of them.

324
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,045
Still. Not as bad
as 1,000 people

325
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,178
going down in
a gigantic boat, right?

326
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,887
My heart will go on.

327
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,087
No. You can't
leave the hospital.

328
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,401
Twenty-five donors contributed to
the plasma that the lung donor got.

329
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,033
My "team" cannot track down and
interview them all in six hours.

330
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,576
I vouch for you to the cops,

331
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:23,079
you take some parole-violating
detour celebrating your freedom,

332
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,480
justified, of course, by some absurd
theory connecting it to the case.

333
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:31,112
You asked me to ask you. Was that
just so you'd enjoy saying no?

334
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,788
I don't trust you,
House. I can't.

335
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,449
Actually, you have to.

336
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:38,051
Not absolutely. Not outside
the walls of this hospital.

337
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,825
Fine, then give me a team I don't
have to put in quotation marks.

338
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,399
Use the people
already on the case.

339
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,128
Get me Chase, Taub, Thirteen.

340
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,497
We don't have
the money to pay them.

341
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:49,300
Oh. Yeah, it went to interior
designers, I understand.

342
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,568
You only have Park because
she's on Neurology's tab.

343
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,167
You are making minimum wage.

344
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,271
I am?

345
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,011
Get out of my office, please.

346
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:15,824
What you got?

347
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,765
Number three went to a baseball
game the day before he donated.

348
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,303
Boredom is not transmissible.

349
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,272
He ate a bag of peanuts. And
peanut proteins would be.

350
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,832
If our donor had an allergy,
could explain the lungs.

351
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,038
Nice.

352
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,439
- What?
- Nothing.

353
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,107
Don't start that

354
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,175
Start what? I'm enjoying
our conversation.

355
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,010
The repartee.

356
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,281
There was no repartee.

357
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,721
That was repartee.

358
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,850
I'm not doing this for you.

359
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,358
I'm doing it
to help my patient.

360
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,326
It's just good to
hear your voice.

361
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:46,994
Good bye.

362
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,806
That's my whiteboard.

363
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:00,969
I need it.

364
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,407
And he really doesn't care
how the cast comes off.

365
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,311
Dr. Foreman warned us
that you'd try something.

366
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,652
Told me to call him if you did.

367
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,255
I'd like to do that

368
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,358
I'll take this outside.

369
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,040
Yeah.

370
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:44,020
<i>Donor six traveled
to Thailand, around Korat.</i>

371
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,283
Region was endemic
with dengue fever.

372
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:47,886
Good.

373
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,777
- Yeah.
- Alcohol.

374
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,450
You'd have to be pretty drunk for
it to affect a pool of plasma.

375
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:19,885
These guys have
got that covered.

376
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:23,455
<i>Acute ETOH ingestion
could have... Hey!</i>

377
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:27,222
Paint around them.
They're not hurting anyone.

378
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,321
Who's painting?

379
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,924
<i>The crew is just starting. The paint
fumes didn't cause contamination.</i>

380
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:35,564
But maybe the old paint did.

381
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,130
They scraped off the underpass,

382
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,674
probably because it contains...

383
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,838
<i>Lead.
...lead.</i>

384
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:45,775
Chest pain back?

385
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:47,283
It's worse this time.

386
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,452
Is there any way to
take the edge off?

387
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,651
We're still working on the lungs.
We should know soon.

388
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,751
Soon is good.

389
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,935
How's the chelation going?

390
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,200
Reverend Moon started it
about 20 minutes ago.

391
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:14,133
You missed lunch tracking
down the plasma donors.

392
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,770
Got you a Reuben
from the cafeteria.

393
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,308
Thanks.

394
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,317
Lead exposure's
a nice diagnosis.

395
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:22,812
I hope it pays off.

396
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,513
It will.

397
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,990
I appreciate your confidence,
but she's not really...

398
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,218
Oh, no, she could die.

399
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,990
But technically'
it would still pay off.

400
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:35,190
Even if your patient dies,
someone will get the lungs.

401
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,498
You really haven't changed.

402
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,302
But I've given up red meat.

403
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,041
What round of
chelation is this?

404
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,642
Fourth.

405
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,049
Are you checking up on me?
Or on House?

406
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,154
On this case.

407
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,092
Unique situation.

408
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,224
Oxygenating?

409
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,936
98%.
Airway resistance down.

410
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:15,198
Great.

411
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,666
Ls House okay?

412
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,766
I have no idea.

413
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,884
Dad, what are you doing here?

414
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:38,891
Got your text. I brought you
some of your mother's gomguk.

415
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:40,055
What text?

416
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:43,690
The one asking me to
bring you some dinner.

417
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:48,299
I went by Neurology. The secretary
said you were on leave.

418
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:49,873
I'm consulting on this case.

419
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,470
Unique situation.

420
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,375
Looks very complicated.

421
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,072
You can help with that?

422
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:04,047
Lungs are crashing.
I have to go.

423
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:05,778
Bye.

424
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,150
Increasing to 100% FIO2.

425
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:10,784
Saline flow is down to 10 cc.

426
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:12,089
Blockage?
Clot in the line?

427
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,654
Chelation is making it worse, which
means we were wrong about lead.

428
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,824
Hold the analysis and
help me save this thing.

429
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,596
Saline's flushing forward,
but getting no return.

430
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,734
One-way valve.
Vasospasm.

431
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,967
If you're right, calcium channel
blocker should relax the artery.

432
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,170
The lungs have no nervous
system, will that still work?

433
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:30,608
We'll know soon.

434
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,808
Saline flow's rising.

435
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,284
Vasospasm's relaxing.

436
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:42,115
Left lung is pinking up.
Good job.

437
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,999
Right middle lobe isn't.

438
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,773
Nothing.

439
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,773
We killed part of the lung.

440
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,848
Page Dr. Pinto stat
to the cath lab.

441
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:16,858
We're going to the oath lab?
Are you thinking that...

442
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:18,394
What? Who?

443
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:21,698
One dead lobe
means four live ones,

444
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:23,494
means enough to transplant,

445
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:26,365
with a side order of dead
tissue that we can test.

446
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,699
Makes sense, unlike you
stealing my phone.

447
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:31,470
You have unlimited texting.

448
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,635
Until your parents know,
you'll never see

449
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,235
that punch for
what it really was,

450
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,811
your February 4th.

451
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:40,414
Sri Lankan Independence Day.

452
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,212
I told you
I'm Korean and Filipino.

453
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:45,686
And I told you I wasn't listening.
By my actions.

454
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:48,925
Violence isn't an appropriate
way to handle conflict.

455
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,322
It was a moment of weakness.

456
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,919
You've barked at me, picked a
fight with a painting crew.

457
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,726
Maybe ifs time to recognize
it's not a character flaw.

458
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,528
Maybe it's your character.

459
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,091
Pinto.

460
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:00,431
House.

461
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:06,336
Embrace your inner bitch.

462
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:14,240
So, why did chelation
make the lungs worse?

463
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,884
We got about five minutes
till Pinto gets back.

464
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,353
Give me a hand with this. No.

465
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:20,924
I tracked down
another bag of plasma

466
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,515
from the batch
they used on the donor,

467
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:25,791
negative for
all our other exposures.

468
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,929
Sarcoidosis could be
inflamed by the treatment.

469
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,893
I'm a cripple,
in need of assistance.

470
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:38,468
Transplant team
ran an ACE, negative.

471
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:40,407
It's mine.
And it's your job.

472
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:43,106
My job is to assist you
in curing the lungs.

473
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:44,875
This chair will
help me do that.

474
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:50,585
What if the scrapings from the
bridge contained other heavy metals,

475
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:53,782
like beryllium, or asbestos?

476
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:57,258
Chelation for lead wouldn't
have made them worse.

477
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,833
But

478
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:09,234
maybe the problem isn't a
heavy metal from outside.

479
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:10,665
It's inside.

480
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:14,403
But it's not leaving the body like
it's supposed to, it's stuck.

481
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:18,306
Iron.
Donor had hemosiderosis.

482
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,644
His body wasn't
disposing of iron,

483
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,685
massive amounts
choke up the lungs.

484
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,947
Then our chelation
would wreak havoc

485
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,284
because it picks up
too much stuff.

486
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,347
Go stain the dead
lung tissue for iron.

487
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:36,024
I'm sorry, young lady, I simply
will not help you steal this chair.

488
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,094
Pinto.
House.

489
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:44,873
Hi.

490
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,506
She can barely
catch her breath.

491
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,446
Lungs ready yet?

492
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,453
We had a small setback. We're
testing for iron overload.

493
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:59,054
I thought it was lead.

494
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,055
This is not an exact process.

495
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,658
Your small airways
are collapsing.

496
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,390
You're not
getting enough oxygen.

497
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:12,734
I'd like to try forcing an
oxygen-rich slurry into your lungs.

498
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,062
It should open up the airways

499
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,161
and buy you some time
until the lungs are ready.

500
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,242
Fluid in my lungs?

501
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,512
Sounds like drowning.

502
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:28,845
It is.

503
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,758
Gonna hurt, isn't it?

504
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,893
Yes. A fair amount.

505
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:45,663
No.

506
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,695
I'm done.

507
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,571
House, the
nurses saw you come in.

508
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,014
Enter.

509
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,442
It's a bathroom.

510
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:04,577
Ah!

511
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,451
Explains the hole
in this chair.

512
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,425
God, I've missed doors.

513
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:17,898
And air freshener.

514
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,036
Now go away. I'm waiting
for some test results.

515
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,473
My patient signed a DNR,
she's giving up.

516
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:29,273
Looks like someone else
will be getting the lungs.

517
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:32,780
Making this yet another interaction
with you in which I get nothing.

518
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,112
It's not my fault you can't
handle your patient.

519
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,814
She said she's done.

520
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,957
I spent half an hour trying to change
her mind, but she'd made her decision.

521
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:42,753
I accepted that.
It's called respect.

522
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,483
What's after respect?

523
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,920
You find another angle,
you hold her hands,

524
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:51,627
get the sister to beg, stick
your fingers in your ears

525
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,259
and pretend you can't hear her.

526
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,096
Do whatever it takes.

527
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,231
Oh. Whatever it takes'? Thanks,
House, I hadn't thought of that.

528
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,015
- What are you testing for?
- Hemosiderosis.

529
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,921
I'm staining for excess iron.

530
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,256
Promising.

531
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:24,090
When your dad showed up unexpectedly,
House have a hand in that?

532
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:26,625
I'm guessing he does
things like that a lot.

533
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,472
His version of a compliment.

534
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,667
I spoke to the head of
Neurology in Chicago.

535
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,006
I gave you
a good recommendation.

536
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,803
Did you mention what happened?

537
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,305
Lawyers say I'm not allowed to.

538
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:42,318
Works out well for everyone.

539
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,016
Why exactly is
that good for you?

540
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:49,148
Excuse me?

541
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,457
I'm a talented physician,
top 2% of my class.

542
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,791
I'm an asset to this hospital,

543
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,525
an asset you're about
to lose to Chicago.

544
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,794
You applied for the job, you asked
me to call and recommend you...

545
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,360
Andrews is the one that should
leave, he's the supervisor.

546
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,903
He touched me first

547
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,133
I can't discuss any of that,
not before the hearing.

548
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:10,203
But if you're having doubts about
Chicago, I can call them back.

549
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,578
No. Thank you.

550
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:22,758
Dr. Foreman,
would you look at this?

551
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,918
Iron?
No.

552
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,894
White blood cells.

553
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,030
Classic presentation
of an infection.

554
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,536
How the hell did we miss that?

555
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:42,007
Biopsy revealed
white blood cell infiltrates.

556
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:45,273
Infection was right after all.

557
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,741
Fresh fruit in prison
is usually chicken.

558
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,852
Why aren't you more alarmed?
We're running out of time.

559
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,015
She's dying!

560
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,618
Were you able to figure out what
was wrong while I was screaming?

561
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,895
Infection was the first thing that
the transplant team treated for.

562
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,628
Which would've worked if the
bacteria had been out in the open.

563
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,601
If they're hiding
inside the lung's cells...

564
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,464
I'm thinking Brucella.

565
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:13,065
To wipe that out,
you need special ops.

566
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,143
An intact immune system.

567
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:19,612
But that's what
white blood cells are.

568
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:23,743
They're part of the immune defense
force, like the infantry.

569
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:27,783
Those lungs need the Air
Force, the Marines,

570
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,325
antibodies
raining down from above.

571
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,460
Antibiotics and MG.

572
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,466
Did you use metaphors
for your old team?

573
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:42,471
Or do you just think
I'm particularly stupid?

574
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,669
No. They were stupid, too.

575
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:57,583
What are you doing here?

576
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:00,479
I'm here for Vanessa.

577
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:02,252
Now is not the time, Bobby.

578
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:05,120
She asked me to come.
Right, Doc?

579
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:09,431
Actually, it was my idea.

580
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,994
What? What are you thinking?
She doesn't want to see him.

581
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,933
When Vanessa was
ready to quit chemo,

582
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,835
Bobby's the one who got
her to do one more round.

583
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,669
Yeah. And then
he got her drunk.

584
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,647
At least tell me you haven't
been drinking today.

585
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,643
I should go.
Yeah.

586
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:32,279
Hail, hail,
the gang's all here.

587
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,059
Hey, beautiful.

588
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:41,320
Hi.

589
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:05,352
Case is under control.
It's me time.

590
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,835
Vanessa's gonna
do the lung slurry.

591
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:27,670
You were right to push me.
I needed that. Thank you.

592
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,437
So we're good?

593
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:35,578
It was good advice. I just
came here to say thank you.

594
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:40,618
I like you.

595
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,182
I have fun with you.

596
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:47,292
And if you can honestly say that you don't
like me, you don't have fun with me,

597
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:48,455
I can accept that

598
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:52,091
But just do whatever you
have to do to get over this.

599
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:54,860
Punch me in the face,
kick me in the nuts.

600
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:59,871
Either/or.
Both seems excessive.

601
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,313
The thing is' House,

602
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,115
I don't like you.

603
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,129
When did
the discoloration start?

604
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,429
A few minutes after
I started the MG.

605
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:34,409
Means we're wrong
about infection.

606
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:37,137
And by we, you mean you.
You screwed up the lungs.

607
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:42,008
Wrong about auto-immune,
about cancer,

608
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:45,111
heavy metals, genetic issues...

609
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:46,478
Increase PEEP.

610
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:47,613
Already maxed out.

611
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,155
We're close to
the point of no return.

612
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,421
The lungs will never be
viable for transplant.

613
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:54,463
<i>L need...</i>

614
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:00,527
I need ideas.

615
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,703
IgA nephropathy?

616
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,504
It's already ruled out.

617
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:06,371
Lupus?
No.

618
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,833
Maybe we're just out of time.

619
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:13,547
We're out of time when we're out of time.
When they die or she dies.

620
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,282
Keep them stable
as long as you can.

621
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,722
I need to think.

622
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:28,754
One, two, three!

623
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:30,019
Make a wish, make a wish!

624
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:50,471
The lungs are smoker.

625
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:52,947
You of all people
should know better.

626
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,311
But the kid never smoked.

627
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:58,552
He played poker. Who plays
poker without cigars?

628
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,948
Even if he didn't
light up himself.

629
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:04,622
<i>It was a rainy night.
The windows were closed.</i>

630
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:07,126
<i>All parents think
their kids are special.</i>

631
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,458
These ones were right.

632
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:10,294
<i>At least his white
blood cells were special.</i>

633
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:13,562
<i>They had an on switch for
reacting to smoke, but no off.</i>

634
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,902
<i>If he inhaled small amounts of
smoke, he had small problems.</i>

635
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,065
<i>No one even noticed.</i>

636
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,474
<i>Big amounts of smoke
is enough to trash a lung.</i>

637
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:25,412
As soon as he breathed in all that
cigar smoke' he was a dead man.

638
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:30,578
The motorcycle accident was an
unnecessary dramatic flourish.

639
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:33,086
Eosinophilic Pneumonitis.

640
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:35,249
But the steroids would
have treated for that.

641
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,016
I was right.

642
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,361
Not about anything medical, but
my metaphors were perfect.

643
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:43,691
We need to hit it harder.

644
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,932
We need to carpet bomb,
blitzkrieg.

645
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,265
We need the nuclear option...

646
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,669
At some point, you're gonna say
we need to radiate, right'?

647
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,332
See? The metaphors work.

648
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,171
But that'll destroy
the good lung, too.

649
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,938
Better to go with a strong
cocktail of immunosuppressants.

650
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,278
Won't be fast enough.
Wilson needs these lungs.

651
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,802
It's working.

652
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,810
He did ii.

653
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,487
I'm not going to Chicago.

654
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,325
If you stay, we'll have
to have a hearing.

655
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:48,229
I know.

656
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:15,851
Dad. Do you
have a minute?

657
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:20,923
Thoracic cavity clear.
Ready for the donor lungs.

658
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,946
Thank God you called him.

659
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,380
Wonder what happens now.

660
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,212
She can handle it.

661
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,572
House.

662
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,579
Got something for you.

663
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,321
Found your stuff in storage.

664
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:34,435
This is all you get. Ortho
still has the outer office.

665
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,036
Well, that sucks.

666
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,941
Where are Chase, Taub
and Thirteen gonna sit?

667
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,845
You're welcome, House.

668
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:18,405
Dinner later?
I'll pick something up.

669
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,652
I heard about a good
new vegetarian place.

670
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:27,085
Screw that.
I want a steak.

671
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,390
I'll meet you
at your place at 8:00.
