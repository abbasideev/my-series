1
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:03,475
Clear!

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,539
Charging. Clear!

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,453
Okay, I'm calling it.

4
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,396
Time of death, 8:32.

5
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:45,775
Hello, Diana.
Shall we?

6
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:53,215
IV tear's within a zone
of fresh tissue necrosis,

7
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:56,783
implicating recent myocardial
infarction as the instigating event.

8
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:01,465
Unfortunately, the medical
records show that Dr. Penza

9
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,466
never suspected heart disease,

10
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:06,970
instead, giving steroids for an
erroneous diagnosis of asthma,

11
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,903
thereby causing the fatal tear.

12
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,476
I suggest these findings
warrant further investigation

13
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,806
into Dr. Penza's standard
of care for this patient,

14
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,350
making this my third such recommendation
regarding Dr. Penza this year.

15
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,484
Concluding autopsy with
examination of the brain.

16
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,826
Dr. Treiber?

17
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,169
I'm cold.

18
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,509
Yes, it's mine.

19
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,079
And, yes, I know that
I can't drive stick.

20
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,581
And, no, I don't care that I
parked in a handicap spot.

21
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:05,589
"Staring death in the face has
changed my life." What a cliché.

22
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,188
The cliché is to lead
a more meaningful life.

23
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,854
I've taken a holy vow to
lead a less meaningful one.

24
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,863
I've spent my life
caring, giving,

25
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,262
and searching for the profound.

26
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:19,360
Now it's time for selfishness,
indifference, and embracing the shallow.

27
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,711
Your scan's in three days.

28
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,615
Tell me this isn't
just you killing time

29
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,280
until you find out if your
cancer's gonna kill it for you?

30
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:42,451
I just paid $75,000 for a
ridiculously impractical car,

31
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,460
the depth of shallowness.

32
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:48,727
And tomorrow, I'm driving it to
Cleveland to meet my boyhood crush.

33
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,395
The years have not been
kind to David Cassidy.

34
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:56,739
<i>Julie Christie, Doctor Zhivago, Shampoo.
I was precocious.</i>

35
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,906
She's opening some kind of charity
animal clinic, or something.

36
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:04,642
I'm neglecting my patients to fulfill
a silly fantasy.

37
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,412
Textbook selfishness
and indifference.

38
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,648
Or you've made sure
that your patients

39
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,815
are well covered,
the car is a rental,

40
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:16,986
and while waiting to get Julie Christie's
autograph, you'll adopt a puppy.

41
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,030
I don't even care whether
you believe me or not.

42
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:25,592
Indifference.

43
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,598
He tried to cut open
his own skull.

44
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,600
Head CT and tox screen
were clean.

45
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,769
Interesting.

46
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:37,348
Cotard delusion. Also known
as Walking Corpse Syndrome.

47
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,643
A disconnect in the amygdala

48
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,548
convinces you that
you're secretly dead.

49
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,612
Case solved, rendering it...

50
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,452
What's the past tense
of "interesting"?

51
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,523
No prior history
of mental illness,

52
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:51,118
and before you say it was caused by
antivirals, I've already ruled that out.

53
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,960
Plus Cotard's doesn't explain
the paresthesia in his hand.

54
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:59,201
Also, Treiber won't let
any other doctor near him.

55
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,537
He trusts your work.

56
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:02,732
Treiber's the patient?

57
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,801
What's the future tense
of "interesting"?

58
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,248
How's Wilson doing? Wilson's
scan is at the end of the week.

59
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,712
If his kickass chemo
shrunk the tumor

60
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,881
to an operable size,
he'll live.

61
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,890
If it didn't, he'll die.

62
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:24,554
That must be very hard. ls
there anything we can do?

63
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:27,097
Other than the prayer
circle, what is there'?

64
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,995
Patient's AST is high.

65
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,832
Psychosis could be brought
on by liver failure.

66
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:33,894
Maybe Hep C?

67
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,565
Bilirubin and serum protein
levels were normal.

68
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:39,337
It doesn't explain the tingly
hand or why Chase hates him.

69
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,412
I don't hate him, he hates me.

70
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,412
He hates all doctors.
And it's mutual.

71
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,244
He only hates
the ones that screw up.

72
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,084
And you.

73
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:51,246
And they only hate Treiber
because he finds their mistakes.

74
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,847
Mistakes are a wee bit easier
to find on a dead patient.

75
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,927
A distinction he fails
to recognize. He's a rat.

76
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,189
Who makes the hospital
a safer place

77
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,528
by keeping doctors
accountable and focused.

78
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,762
What if he got something
from a cadaver?

79
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:04,858
He handles a lot of them.

80
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,632
You suggesting we DDx them all?

81
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,706
No, just his last one.

82
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,037
She had bad knees.

83
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,767
If she used dimethyl
sulfoxide for joint pain,

84
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,041
current from the defibrillator could've
converted it to dimethyl sulfate.

85
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,447
When Treiber cut into her, her
blood released toxic fumes.

86
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,109
Everyone in the basement
would be sick.

87
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,421
Well, gas would've
dissipated quickly.

88
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,921
His lungs are fine.

89
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,616
Blood clots make more sense.

90
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,886
One in his hand
explains the paresthesia,

91
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:32,486
one in his carotid explains
the psychotic episode.

92
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,399
You two look for
toxic exposure.

93
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,298
Adams, you can
help Chase ultrasound

94
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,461
his evil nemesis
for evil clots.

95
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,637
I know House doesn't like
seeing his patients,

96
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,733
but doesn't a fellow doctor
rate an exception?

97
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,643
Psychosis appears
to be intermittent.

98
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,339
Just snapped out of it
long enough to ask

99
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,075
if House actually
ordered this test.

100
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,914
Don't worry, we're simply
carrying out his direct orders.

101
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,421
Right, I forgot. That's
what you were hired to do.

102
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,658
Which is fine. His diagnostic
error metric is .17,

103
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,988
compared to
the hospital average of .32.

104
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,257
You actually think you can quantify
the value of every doctor?

105
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,320
Someone should.

106
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,161
And since I'm the only one
who sees everything...

107
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,259
Right. You were hired to diagnose
people after they're already dead.

108
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,762
No sign of stenosis or clots.

109
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,273
Every doctor, every diagnosis,

110
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,006
every treatment, every result.

111
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,340
It's pretty impressive.

112
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,608
It's pretty Orwellian.

113
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,844
All written in his secret code.

114
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,681
He has to keep it confidential.

115
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,345
Just like the
Wannsee Conference?

116
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,946
The Big Brother metaphor
wasn't pointed enough for you?

117
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,458
You had to throw in Hitler?

118
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:39,294
A couple years ago, he noticed
a link in child deaths,

119
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,955
and it's completely changed
hospital policies on...

120
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,195
I get it, Treiber is nerd king.

121
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,896
The more people we kill,
the more lives he saves.

122
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,704
Test is negative for dimethyl sulfate.
Her blood is not toxic.

123
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,369
Then we should look for toxic
exposures from something else.

124
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,973
You really think the hospital is idiotic
enough to issue toxic supplies?

125
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,143
Have you seen his tools?

126
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,683
Treiber doesn't always
use "hospital issue".

127
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,155
Then he's the idiot?

128
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,819
No, but I don't want to explain
that assumption to House.

129
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,157
Found something.
Found something.

130
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,364
Thought we'd
make it a road trip.

131
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,364
'80s music, junk food, beer.

132
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:25,876
I have a dental appointment.

133
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,842
That I'm going to make now.

134
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,604
Ah... I'll let you drive.

135
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,271
Not worth listening
to you whine about

136
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,850
your feelings and fears
for three days.

137
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,909
It's not gonna happen.
I've taken a vow.

138
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,386
People don't change.
You're a person.

139
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,515
Ergo, pass.

140
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:44,521
Yes, that's why I brought this.
20005 of propofol.

141
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,689
You can accompany me willingly, or
I will, when you least expect ii,

142
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,700
inject the contents of this
vial into your bloodstream.

143
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:54,367
The fall might result in a
concussion, or fractures,

144
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,531
or you might get lucky,

145
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,700
and simply wake up somewhere near
Allentown with a nasty headache.

146
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,641
The choice is yours, and
in case you've forgotten,

147
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,371
I am indifferent.

148
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,047
We leave tomorrow
morning at 8:00 a.m.

149
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:11,615
No clots.

150
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:12,781
No gas.

151
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,122
But we found enough of this to
reanimate the entire morgue.

152
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,661
He's jacked on caffeine.

153
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,388
Stimulant psychosis.

154
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,162
How many times do I have
to solve this case'?

155
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:25,392
So all we have to do is hydrate
and observe him for 24 hours?

156
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,234
Why don't you tell him it was your idea?
He might warm up to you.

157
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,834
If you get an ear in the
mail, it's probably mine.

158
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,805
My abdomen!
It's my abdomen!

159
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,818
It's just the effects of withdrawal.
The pain is normal.

160
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,752
No. No, this isn't right.

161
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,326
Abdominal pain
and distension means

162
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,421
we were wrong about
stimulant psychosis.

163
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,468
They could be
coexistent problems.

164
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,162
He might just
have an obstruction.

165
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,103
You know what House says
about coincidences.

166
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,336
I didn't feel any masses when I
examined him, and no bowel sounds.

167
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:06,699
Where's House?

168
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,937
He hasn't come in yet.

169
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,675
And neither has Wilson. I've
already tried him three times.

170
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,113
Here we go again.

171
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:16,342
Diabetes could cause nerve damage
in his hand and gut, and...

172
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,444
Except his
glucose levels are normal

173
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:21,025
and he probably would've
mentioned he was a diabetic.

174
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:22,525
What about ulcerative colitis?

175
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:23,787
Earlier attacks
caused thrombosis...

176
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,055
We already looked for clots,

177
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,789
and there was no blood
in his stool.

178
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:32,859
Try him again.

179
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,896
And Wilson's.

180
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,389
Wherever they are, they
don't want to be disturbed.

181
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,236
If we take 78,

182
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:19,750
we can do the Sweet Treats &
Salty Eats Snack Food Trail.

183
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,679
My trip, my itinerary.

184
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,015
We have to cover
300 miles today

185
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,420
to be there with plenty of time

186
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,684
to catch Julie
by 4:00 tomorrow.

187
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,590
And that thing I said about
letting you drive? I lied.

188
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,357
What?

189
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,695
I'm impressed.

190
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:44,039
Not by thai, but by your real
effort to maintain the facade.

191
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:48,441
It's been almost an hour and there's been
no mention of the elephant in the car.

192
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,037
Well, I declined
the elephant option.

193
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,709
Uh-huh.

194
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,553
In three days, you're gonna
find out if you live or die.

195
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,553
You don't want
to talk about it?

196
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,113
No, but obviously you do.

197
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:03,217
So we're gonna talk about it,
but because I want to?

198
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:04,989
I am neither talking about it

199
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,791
nor talking about
not talking about it.

200
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,457
You are hard-wired
to talk about it.

201
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,466
It's how you cope,
it's who you are.

202
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:15,562
Yeah, well, from now on,
I am not me. I'm...

203
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,302
I'm Kyle Calloway.

204
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,411
I thought your porn name
was Rusty Packard.

205
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:25,972
Kyle is roguish, carefree, and shares
no qualities with James Wilson.

206
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,745
Can Kyle drive stick?

207
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,827
Treiber won't let us
do anything without House.

208
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,025
House just took himself
off the case.

209
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,097
You said no bowel sounds
when you examined him.

210
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,262
No, like "diminished",
or "none at all"? None.

211
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,600
You think it's
an intussusception?

212
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,267
If it is, it could mean
cancer's behind everything.

213
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,503
Let's get a plain film
of his abdomen.

214
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,339
Treiber will refuse
any procedure

215
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:55,845
that wasn't ordered by House.

216
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,608
Only if he knows it wasn't.

217
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,015
You want to lie to a guy whose favorite
pastime is getting doctors fired?

218
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,519
We're adults with
advanced medical training,

219
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,282
not children left alone
with scissors.

220
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:06,848
It's one X-ray.

221
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:18,527
If we had a phone' we could've found
somewhere a little less charming.

222
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,293
If we had a phone,
you'd be making calls,

223
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,704
<i>downloading porn and
playing Angry Birds.</i>

224
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,873
This trip is about me,
and I like this place.

225
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,206
It's not about you not
wanting me to have a phone.

226
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,405
You're weak.

227
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,548
You knew that you'd backslide

228
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,878
and spend your time
talking to teary ex-wives,

229
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:34,974
and your parents.

230
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,714
Trying to make them feel
better about you being sick.

231
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,815
Bacon burger with fries looks awful.
I'll have that.

232
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,423
I'll have The Big One.

233
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,561
You sure? It's $79.

234
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,329
Unless I finish it in an hour,
in which case, it's free.

235
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,571
It's an 80 ounce steak.

236
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:57,663
I'm hungry.

237
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,342
And an iced tea, please.

238
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,742
Big One's up!

239
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,575
This place doesn't
take credit cards.

240
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,415
My meal is going to be free,

241
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,754
and I'm going to be inducted
into the Wall of Pain.

242
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,260
Hello, Kyle.

243
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,026
No!
Belly film was normal.

244
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,537
No sign of an intussusception
or any other obstruction.

245
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:28,697
House says it's there?

246
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,600
Sometimes House is wrong.

247
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,269
Run my bowel.

248
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,438
That's serious surgery. General
anesthesia, long recovery...

249
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,608
We can do a contrast enema
if you need more proof.

250
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,618
I have drawers filled with
people who had clean scans.

251
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,419
I know how easy it is
to miss something

252
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,548
unless you use your
own hands and eyes.

253
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,557
Run my bowel. We'll let
House know how you feel.

254
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:52,127
How I feel is twisted
in white, hot agony.

255
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,723
His orders were to look
for an intussusception.

256
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,665
Until you actually do that,
I refuse any other tests.

257
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,264
Fine.

258
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,135
No, not fine!

259
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,571
We need to talk... And I
want you to do the surgery.

260
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,507
Statistically, you're the
best surgeon in the hospital.

261
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,750
Kyle! Kyle!

262
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,151
Come on, you got this!

263
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,980
You got this! Come on!

264
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,318
Twenty five seconds.

265
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,654
You got this!

266
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,092
Come on! Home stretch,
Kyle! Home stretch!

267
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,095
Fifteen seconds!

268
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,164
Kyle! Kyle!
Kyle! Kyle!

269
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,495
No, don't chew!
Just swallow!

270
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,762
- Just keep the meat down.
- Six...

271
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,031
- ...five, four...
- Five, four...

272
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,108
For the love of God, swallow!
...three, two, one!

273
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,437
Time!

274
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,275
Yes! Yes!

275
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:50,445
Yes! Oh, you
magnificent bastard.

276
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,712
Smile!

277
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,530
It still counts, though, right?

278
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,370
No hard feelings, right?

279
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,303
You'll find out
when you wake up.

280
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,878
If you really think
I'm a good doctor,

281
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,540
why do you treat me
like an idiot?

282
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,918
It's not because
you lack talent.

283
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,749
It's because you've wasted it.

284
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,819
Did you know I applied to be a fellow
with House the same year as you'?

285
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:28,915
No.

286
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,989
I quit my other program,

287
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,225
relocated, broke up
with my girlfriend.

288
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,499
Then your father made a call
and, suddenly, you had the spot.

289
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:39,728
That was almost 10 years ago.

290
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:40,997
Do you know what
I could've done

291
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,767
after even three
years with House?

292
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,498
Gone to the CDC, WHO,

293
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,544
started a diagnostics
department some place

294
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,170
they'd never even
heard of such a thing.

295
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:52,847
You've been given everything.

296
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,513
Looks, talent, my future.

297
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,088
Nine years later,

298
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,618
look what you've done with it.

299
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,602
Ugh!

300
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:19,707
Must be nice to be puking for
the old-fashioned reasons.

301
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,883
I'm glad I did ii.

302
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,708
You see those people out
there cheering for me'?

303
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,878
I was a hero.

304
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:34,650
For one fleeting moment, for
an incredibly stupid reason,

305
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:38,060
for a bunch of morons
I'll never see again.

306
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,662
God, it felt good.

307
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,063
And now if you'll excuse me,

308
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,241
I think I've made
room for dessert.

309
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,847
How long do you think
you'll work for House?

310
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:09,988
As long as he lets me.

311
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,154
When House was in prison, you worked
at Mercy, in plastics, right?

312
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,190
Know what I did?
Surfed.

313
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,599
For nine months.
Yes.

314
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:21,194
And if I didn't have two
daughters and alimony,

315
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,772
I might have done the same.

316
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,604
A fellowship's supposed to train
you to stand on your own.

317
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,039
Foreman's dean of the hospital,

318
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,511
Cameron's head of emergency
medicine in Chicago.

319
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,445
And Kutner and Amber are dead,

320
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,609
and Thirteen's having sweet
Sapphic sex on some island.

321
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,780
Look at this,
in his small intestine.

322
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,183
Is it an intussusception?

323
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,015
No.

324
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,053
Guess Treiber was right.

325
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,494
He hasn't checked
his voice-mail.

326
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,694
Or his email.

327
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,864
It's been almost 24 hours, shouldn't
we call Foreman, or the police?

328
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,531
I think this
makes him a fugitive.

329
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,132
We don't have to tell anyone.

330
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,875
Treiber's symptoms started
in his frontal lobe

331
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,207
and moved through
his nervous system.

332
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,713
Hands, bowels, muscles.

333
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,044
Intermittent porphyria.

334
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,310
He's in the middle
of an attack.

335
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,545
The longer we wait to treat with
haemin, the more damage it causes.

336
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,213
The longer we wait to tell him
House isn't running the case,

337
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,985
the more damage
that causes. It's fraud.

338
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,549
It's only an issue
if we're wrong.

339
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:17,821
It's more
than one X-ray,

340
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,227
more than exploratory
surgery even.

341
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,156
This is a drug that will
damage him if you're wrong.

342
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,667
Same principle.

343
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,408
I want a threesome.

344
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,351
Shouldn't we try
a twosome first?

345
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,887
Two women.
Oh.

346
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,789
I know they're
probably overrated,

347
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:51,088
and I'll probably be
gravely disappointed,

348
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,457
but I want one anyway.

349
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,096
No, you don't.

350
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,529
Well, Kyle wants one.

351
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,695
Kyle's only one day old. He
doesn't know what he wants.

352
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,399
I don't want to think
about consequences.

353
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,031
I don't want to think about...

354
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:09,312
I don't want to think about
anything I just wanna do.

355
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:19,055
Okay. I need you to do
exactly what I tell you.

356
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,387
Yeah, yeah.

357
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,386
Porphyria?

358
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,295
I know the anesthesia
makes it hard to focus,

359
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,390
but we need to start you
on haemin right away.

360
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:40,066
House believes very strongly
this is the right call.

361
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,404
Okay.

362
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,153
This thing is peeling.

363
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,593
Well, that is
the cost of cowardice.

364
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,097
Should've gone
for the real thing.

365
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,996
I feel like I'm cheating.

366
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,329
"A", it is only cheating
if you don't have cancer,

367
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,769
and it's Wednesday afternoon.
Pickings are slim.

368
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,535
And more importantly, sober.

369
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:14,041
The cancer cut is the surest
way to the pity-pooty party.

370
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,782
One down, one to go.

371
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,542
What?
Wait, wait, what'?

372
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,618
She said yes?
To a threesome?

373
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,622
She's empathetic.

374
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,949
She's a hooker.
Gave me a cancer rate.

375
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,859
No, I have never paid
for sex in my life.

376
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:35,364
You still haven't.
It's my treat.

377
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:38,359
It's either that or you find
two very open-minded women

378
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,198
to fall in love with you
in the next hour.

379
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:48,976
Bartender seems nice.

380
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,812
She seems female.

381
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:54,976
Want something to eat?

382
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:58,819
My friend is dying of cancer.

383
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,646
God, you poor thing.

384
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,992
It took my mother
two years ago.

385
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:07,229
But you can't give up hope.

386
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:13,161
He's pretty much resigned. Just
wants to go out with a bang.

387
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:17,068
And another pun'
what time do you get off?

388
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,942
Pleural effusions.
It's not porphyria.

389
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:29,915
We're gonna need to
put in a chest tube.

390
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:30,953
I want Dr. House.

391
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:33,114
We'll tell him exactly...
l wanna talk to him!

392
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,856
I want House!
Where is House?

393
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:40,961
Where is he?
Where's House?

394
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:43,022
We don't know.

395
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,377
You didn't have
to sleep out here.

396
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,453
Four's a crowd.

397
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,082
Apparently they left
a longtime ago.

398
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:13,587
So, how was it? Was the
amateur as good as the pro?

399
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:19,597
It was confusing'
perfunctory, and a bit sad.

400
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:20,726
Never mind.

401
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,272
And exactly what I needed.

402
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,397
Thank you.

403
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,176
You feel like
buying me breakfast?

404
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,242
One of them stole my wallet.

405
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,621
You're lucky
he's not pressing charges.

406
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,623
Porphyria was
a legitimate call.

407
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,619
Until the pleural effusions.

408
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,750
We've done everything House
would have if he'd been here.

409
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,851
You lied to a patient.

410
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,362
Treiber's condition
is declining rapidly.

411
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:51,696
He's agreed to let me
take over the case.

412
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,792
Dr. Chase will have no further
contact with the patient.

413
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,603
Fine. I didn't say you
were off the case!

414
00:24:58,931 --> 00:24:59,932
Sit down.

415
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,144
I ordered a cardiac MRI,

416
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:06,308
enlargement of the left ventricle
suggests an infiltrative disease.

417
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:08,449
It's sarcoidosis.

418
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,781
We could start him
on corticosteroids

419
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,287
and do a cardiac
biopsy to confirm.

420
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,649
I disagree.

421
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:13,722
I was wrong about
the porphyria,

422
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,689
but I wasn't wrong about
the nervous system.

423
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,387
It's a prion disease.

424
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:19,224
That's why his symptoms
have progressed so rapidly.

425
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:21,320
It's possible he was exposed
and didn't know it.

426
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:24,332
Brains are often stored and not
tested until weeks after autopsy.

427
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,231
Treiber's too good to not
take the right precautions.

428
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:28,464
Maybe the problem is
he thinks the same thing.

429
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:31,035
His job's built on the premise
that doctors make mistakes.

430
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,200
That includes him.

431
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,866
We should do a brain biopsy.
In his condition?

432
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,536
Then we biopsy
the brains in the morgue.

433
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:36,704
Find the one that exposed him.

434
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:37,872
It's a needle in a haystack.

435
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:38,971
There's four of us.

436
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,172
Come on, we can
at least start him

437
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,877
on amphotericin
to halt the progress

438
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:43,146
while you do your heart biopsy.

439
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,155
No, we can't. Amphotericin plus
the contrast dye for the biopsy

440
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,158
would overwhelm his kidneys. We
have to choose one or the other.

441
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:52,889
Biopsy his heart.

442
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,404
Wallets go in the
minibar freezer.

443
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:08,376
If there's no minibar, the toilet tank.
I've got exactly $20 left.

444
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:12,608
I'm sorry, I wasn't familiar
with hooker protocol.

445
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:13,705
We could use your credit cards.

446
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,751
No, we won't. I'm
still on probation.

447
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:19,550
Leaving the state without
permission will really P.0. my P.O.

448
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:20,713
Doesn't matter.

449
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:24,626
We can't even
afford gas to get home.

450
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:26,286
And we're three hours
behind schedule.

451
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,296
We have enough gas
to get to Julie.

452
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,866
I don't care
about anything else.

453
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,570
What this time?

454
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,564
Just wondering
how long this can last.

455
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:40,806
You're still hoping that I'm
gonna wake up and admit

456
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,901
that Kyle Galloway is
just some lame excuse

457
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,413
to have some naughty
thrills, aren't you?

458
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,943
I'm actually hoping you won't.

459
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,044
<i>L like Kyle.</i>

460
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,760
Oh, come on!

461
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:44,693
Whoa!

462
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:57,676
Whoa! Whoa!

463
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,069
House!

464
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,603
You okay?

465
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:33,476
My leg still hurts.

466
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,284
Come on!

467
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:45,322
We got 20 bucks to go 11 miles.

468
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,335
Why aren't you
answering your pages?

469
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:02,776
I'm busy.

470
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:06,505
The biopsy showed fibrosis
in his cardiac muscle.

471
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,576
So it's not a prion disease.

472
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:10,312
It means Foreman
was wrong, too.

473
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:13,481
He wants everyone to meet
in his office to DDx.

474
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,485
So he can tell us all
it's an infection?

475
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:20,654
Interesting, or maybe you should
consider not being such a baby.

476
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,993
My first instinct was an
exposure from a corpse.

477
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:25,198
Treiber spends
all his time here.

478
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,605
If it's not toxic gas,
or prions,

479
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,269
then it has to be something else.
He's not perfect.

480
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,845
Are you trying to cure him
or discredit him?

481
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:39,347
Treiber can only see me as
"Not House", Foreman, too.

482
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,276
And they're not wrong.

483
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,115
So you're not coming upstairs?

484
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:53,123
No. And when this case
is over, I'm quitting.

485
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,799
He's not quitting.

486
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,533
He already called
other hospitals.

487
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,039
Treiber did get under his skin.

488
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,473
He'll get over it.

489
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:08,806
Fibrosis has to be a
response to an infection.

490
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,311
Chase said you'd say that

491
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:13,739
We'll test the biopsy
samples for viruses,

492
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,750
and start him
on anti-virals.

493
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:18,648
You're not even going
to talk to Chase?

494
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,917
He didn't leave after he
got stabbed in the heart.

495
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,082
I think we're okay.

496
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:25,156
Either you're right, and your
friend is just really upset,

497
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,663
or you're wrong, and he's come
at this calmly and rationally,

498
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:31,564
and you're about to lose a good doctor.
Either way...

499
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:56,355
This is Oubliette, Ohio. Buses
don't run here after 1968.

500
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,786
Ina said there's a bus
every 15 minutes.

501
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,261
Ina is living in
Alzheimersville.

502
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:04,930
Been here at least
half an hour.

503
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:07,799
Where are you going, Ina?

504
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:09,031
Naples, Florida.

505
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:13,439
Ben and I have a beautiful three-bedroom
condo, all on the one floor.

506
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:16,110
You're waiting
for a bus to Naples?

507
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:20,614
Comes every 15 minutes. Ben'll be
wondering where his dinner is.

508
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,042
Cab.

509
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,317
Whoa! Cab!

510
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,891
20 bucks, 11 miles.
Come on!

511
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,721
Come on, let's go.

512
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:38,634
Julie is gonna be at the clinic

513
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,169
for another 45 minutes,
we can make this!

514
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,670
She thinks she's in Florida.

515
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:50,174
Okay.
Bring her with.

516
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,309
I'm waiting for the bus.

517
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:53,576
Bus isn't coming, Ina.

518
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,907
But this cab is
going to Naples.

519
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,477
- Ben'll be getting awfully hungry.
- House.

520
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:00,915
We'll tell the cabbie
to call the cops.

521
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,856
They'll come pick her up.
Take care of her.

522
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:08,824
Then I'll stay with her
until they do.

523
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,108
Goodbye, Kyle.

524
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,050
Bus comes every 15 minutes.

525
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,684
Oh, shut up.

526
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:44,789
Find anything?

527
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:48,293
Not yet.

528
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,466
Running tests for MRSA.

529
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,369
You've got everybody worried
about you quitting.

530
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,038
You here as my boss
or my friend?

531
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,138
<i>If I was here as your boss,
you'd be suspended by now.</i>

532
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:06,086
I've learnt a lot here.

533
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,714
Enough to run my own team.

534
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:10,982
It's time I moved on.

535
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:16,896
Unfortunately, that's how I felt
last year, and the year before that.

536
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,266
Maybe there's a reason
you haven't left.

537
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,902
You need structure and support.

538
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,943
Somebody else
calling the shots.

539
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:37,112
You didn't come down here
as my boss or my friend.

540
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:39,617
You came down as House.

541
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,086
You're trying to insult me
into making a decision?

542
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,094
We've both seen it work.

543
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,598
Either you rise to
the challenge and quit,

544
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,201
or you stay

545
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,370
as a team member.

546
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,937
Dr. Treiber! Dr. Treiber!

547
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,314
He stopped responding when
I was changing his IV bag.

548
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,719
Peter, open your eyes.

549
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,553
Coma.

550
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:28,329
Treiber's comatose.

551
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:29,564
All brains on deck.

552
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,663
Where should we start?
We think you might be right.

553
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:33,501
I'm not.

554
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:35,635
You couldn't have gone
through all of these.

555
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:36,906
Don't have to.

556
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,641
Treiber's reports are thorough to a
fault, his methods are fastidious.

557
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:46,112
The answer isn't down here.

558
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,088
Treiber didn't
miss anything, we did.

559
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,456
So what?
Psychosis, abdominal pain,

560
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,188
pleural effusions,
enlarged heart, coma.

561
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,523
Autoimmune, maybe Good pasture's.
Kidneys are fine.

562
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,098
- Vasculitis?
- No fever.

563
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,998
Lymphoma? Would've
seen it on the heart biopsy.

564
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:01,826
Soap. It's the soap.

565
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:20,779
I blew ii.

566
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,525
Oh, God, here it comes.

567
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,125
As always. All I wanted
was some meaningless fun,

568
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,961
and I couldn't
even last three days.

569
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:33,127
Sound asleep!
I'm sleep talking.

570
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,029
I had the chance to
fulfill a lifelong dream.

571
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,200
I swear I will jump out of this
moving bus if you don't shut up.

572
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:44,303
But instead, I sat with a sad,
old woman for an hour and a half

573
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:47,042
who forgot I existed three
seconds after she left.

574
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,715
And the stupidest thing?

575
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,377
I never even had a crush
on Julie Christie.

576
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,886
In 12th grade, I was madly
in love with Melanie Robbins

577
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,988
who happened lo look exactly like
Julie Christie in Doctor Zhivago.

578
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,399
And she really liked me.

579
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,729
We played spades every lunch period
in Mr. Charlton's classroom.

580
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,408
But, of course,
there was this other guy.

581
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,941
A great guy, Very popular.

582
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:19,379
He had a car, he had a
band, a moustache...

583
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,412
Kyle Calloway.

584
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,261
I assumed that...

585
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,524
I hoped that we would go
to the senior prom together.

586
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,533
But she asked me for a favor.

587
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:46,698
She asked if I minded if she went with him.
She asked me if I minded.

588
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,143
And I said I didn't.

589
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,076
And that was it.

590
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:57,779
And I just did it again.

591
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,589
I let it go,
like I let everything go.

592
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,454
And here I am,
sitting on this bus,

593
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,549
with tickets I bought
with my watch,

594
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,926
heading back home,

595
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,463
so a CT scan
can decide my fate.

596
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,332
I don't want to go back, House.

597
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:27,179
I just...

598
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:29,183
I just want to keep being Kyle.

599
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:40,328
Kyle would've ditched that sad,
old woman from the bus stop.

600
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:43,925
He probably would've
ditched me, too.

601
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,939
I can live without Kyle.

602
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,441
Sno Ball?

603
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,393
Guess this isn't heaven.

604
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:19,124
We found out who screwed up.

605
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,730
You.

606
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:24,496
It was your industrial
strength antibacterial soap.

607
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,033
The additional triclosan
does two things well.

608
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,136
Kills MRSA, and makes
your thyroid look stupid.

609
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:34,340
It thinks the triclosan is a real
hormone and closes up shop.

610
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:38,385
Excessive use over time, combined
with excessive use of this,

611
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,184
led to hyperthyroidism,

612
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:43,055
which went undiagnosed until
it presented with psychosis.

613
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,218
When the ER put you
on sedatives,

614
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,353
it kicked you
into myxedema crisis.

615
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,998
Don't know that I ever
would have thought of that.

616
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,199
House taught us
to look for irony.

617
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:58,900
Hey.

618
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:02,433
This wasn't House.

619
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:25,390
My locker key.

620
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,927
I'll give you your own team.

621
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:31,896
Thanks.

622
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:34,771
But it's time to
step out of the shadow.

623
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:47,250
It's about time.

624
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,111
Any news?

625
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,146
Not yet.

626
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:27,157
You come here so I can
talk you out of it?

627
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:30,327
I came to say thank you.

628
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:42,504
It's been fun.

629
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:44,969
"Fun"?

630
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:51,352
Sounded pithier than, "We've
shared a variety of situations".

631
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,057
<i>Let me know about Wilson.</i>

632
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:12,835
<i>Why did you let him go?</i>

633
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,040
Legal loophole, 13th amendment.

634
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:21,139
Abraham Lincoln may have
looked great in that hat,

635
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,708
but his labor policies...

636
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:35,586
<i>House?</i>
