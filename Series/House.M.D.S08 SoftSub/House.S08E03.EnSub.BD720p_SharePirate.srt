1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:04,706
If you don't know how to use
a computer, we will teach you here.

2
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:07,649
Most jobs require at least
basic word processing skills.

3
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:10,382
We try to get you up to
50 words per minute.

4
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:14,323
We also have a course in how to
talk to someone in an interview.

5
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,884
Stuff like what
employers are looking for,

6
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:18,554
how to turn
negatives into positives.

7
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:20,791
We can also provide clothes for
the interview if you need them.

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,664
People donate shoes and
suits all the time.

9
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,534
What if I had
a history with drugs?

10
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,037
That is nothing
to be ashamed of.

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,905
Many of our clients have
struggled with addiction,

12
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:35,208
and if you want to get clean,
we'll help you do that.

13
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:36,804
And what if I have a kid?

14
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,009
No one to help you?

15
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:43,578
If I need someone to watch her while
I'm in a class or on an interview

16
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,814
could you help with that?

17
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,256
We do not provide child care.

18
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,725
Actually, it's something
that comes up often.

19
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,885
I would love to
be able to do it.

20
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,931
I just don't
have the resources.

21
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:56,558
But it's definitely
on the wish list.

22
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:02,203
Okay. Okay, uh, thank you.
I'll be back.

23
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,670
I have to take this.

24
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,006
Yes, please come back.
We'll get you started.

25
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,246
It was nice to
meet you, Benjamin.

26
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:10,906
Hey, Oscar.

27
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,343
Ugh! That is too bad.

28
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,388
Did they tell you why?

29
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:24,856
Yeah.

30
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,221
Mmm-hmm.

31
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,860
Well, look, you know what? Sometimes
you just don't get the job.

32
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,529
Oscar, I've got to
call you back.

33
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,366
Uh...

34
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,205
Uh, uh...

35
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,112
Benjamin!
Benjamin, wait.

36
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:53,051
Oh, my God.

37
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,501
Somebody call an ambulance!

38
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,626
Why am I watching
you cut your hair?

39
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:14,035
If I do it at home, I'm the
one who has to clean it up.

40
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:18,303
I was referring less to where
it's happening and more to why.

41
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,311
New life, new look.

42
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,972
Does that mean you
like your new life?

43
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,052
If you're asking
if your job is safe,

44
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,144
that depends on what you have to
say about the file you're holding.

45
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,655
It doesn't seem
like much of a case.

46
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,556
Although, I'm sure I'm wrong.

47
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,650
You are.
Tell me why.

48
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,230
Guy collapsed after being
on his feet for hours

49
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,823
on a hot day without breakfast,
so that's really weird.

50
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,497
ER found nothing wrong then I
decided I should test his wallet.

51
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,665
He's rich? That's why
we're taking the case?

52
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,038
No, we're taking
the case because

53
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,169
no one knows
what's wrong with him.

54
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,837
And he's rich.

55
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,506
Dr. Adams.

56
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,584
Give her the file.

57
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,245
This is my only copy.

58
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,353
My MO depends upon
the use of a team.

59
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,588
Definitionally, that involves
more than one person,

60
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,027
so I really have no choice.

61
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,190
Give her the file.
You can't afford a team.

62
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,091
Adams is free.

63
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,033
And I'm referring both to her
availability and her price tag.

64
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,633
New girl meet newer girl,
and vice versa.

65
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,267
You said we were
meeting for coffee.

66
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,744
Well, when someone
asks if you want coffee,

67
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,043
they obviously
don't just mean coffee.

68
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,942
Wait. Did you think
I was referring to sex?

69
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,782
Would you shut the
blinds on your way out'?

70
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,879
I thought you were
referring to talking.

71
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,788
Talking about medicine.

72
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,623
Specifically, as it refers to the
guy whose name is on the file

73
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,719
she still hasn't handed you.

74
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:49,733
I'm not working, House. I'm in the
process of looking for a paying job.

75
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,293
And in the meantime, there's
no way a do-gooder like you

76
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,133
isn't volunteering
all over town,

77
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,400
ladling kittens, spaying soup.

78
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,737
There's a free clinic
in Trenton.

79
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,443
Well, think of this
as today's free clinic.

80
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,412
Only with fewer
bums with herpes.

81
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,916
I don't think we actually
have much of a case.

82
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,350
I think it's just dehydration.

83
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,612
What happened the last
time another doctor

84
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,157
told you I was
wrong about a case?

85
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,691
I lost my job.

86
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,758
But you saved a life.

87
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,664
Is an ultrasound really necessary?
I'm feeling much better now.

88
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,759
A sudden collapse
at your age can indicate

89
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,499
a deterioration in
the heart muscle,

90
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,769
a pretty serious condition.

91
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,333
It could also
just be dehydration.

92
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,708
Next time, you could probably
drop the undercover act.

93
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:40,175
I walk in in a suit, and they're
gonna put their best foot forward.

94
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,219
Also I don't own a suit.

95
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,614
You give away millions,
and you don't own a suit?

96
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,181
<i>I gave those away too.</i>

97
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,894
One day I was writing
a check to my landscaper,

98
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,519
and it suddenly hit me,

99
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:55,794
$6,000 to take out plants
and put in different plants

100
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,028
so I can look at them.

101
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,297
Shouldn't I use that money
to do something important?

102
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,704
And by money, you
mean all your money.

103
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,037
I started with $10 million,

104
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:09,637
and then I couldn't think of a
reason not to give 20 or 40.

105
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,718
I figure I can live
on $25,000 a year.

106
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,714
<i>One room apartment, bus pass,
 thrift stores, bare necessities.</i>

107
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,315
I still have
my software company.

108
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,554
And when I make more,
I'll give that away too.

109
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,494
He's nuts.
He's generous.

110
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,490
There's a neurological issue.
He's getting rid of everything.

111
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,229
His echocardiogram was
negative for cardiomyopathy.

112
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,566
Head CT showed no signs
of stroke or hemorrhage.

113
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,072
He has one pair of pants!

114
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,903
Most people with
his kind of money

115
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,911
are commissioning oil paintings
of their Yorkshire terrier.

116
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:44,244
Benjamin is sacrificing his
own comfort to help others.

117
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,580
That's 'cause helping others
is his Yorkie oil painting.

118
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,915
That's good, not sick.

119
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,751
That's naive and sick.

120
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,018
You really want to improve things,
you do it through policy.

121
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,754
This guy empties his pockets,
what really changes?

122
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,922
That's right. All those babies
with AIDS, they're just using us.

123
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,859
My parents had $800 between
them when they got here.

124
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,698
They scraped and borrowed so
we could go to good schools.

125
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,104
And I worked my ass off.
No one gave me a handout.

126
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,299
It makes me work harder.

127
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,110
Rebuttal.

128
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,304
What's your evil plan?

129
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,938
I object to your cynicism.

130
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,039
It's been earned.
That's what I object to.

131
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,585
New Dean of Medicine has an
ethical obligation to come in

132
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,949
with a completely open mind
about all employees,

133
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:27,218
thus letting me blithely run
roughshod tor at least four weeks.

134
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,754
My theory is that you're
running a battery of tests

135
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,590
to convince him that
you've saved his life,

136
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,664
and then con him into funding
you to hire back your team.

137
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,255
What?
Your old team?

138
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,069
What?
This is your new reality.

139
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,331
You've got your office,
you've got neighbors,

140
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,100
you've got one employee,
one volunteer

141
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,072
until she finds actual paid
work or gets sick of you.

142
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:48,078
I talked to Chase and Taub.
They're willing to come back.

143
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,447
What about Thirteen?

144
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,076
Not a good choice. She's not a
long-term, because she has no long-term.

145
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,080
Not taking your calls?

146
00:07:58,745 --> 00:07:59,849
She will.

147
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,448
Discharge the patient.

148
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,960
Unexplained loss of consciousness
could be cardiomyopathy,

149
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,122
global anoxia,
subarachnoid hemorrhage...

150
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,927
Dehydration. He was given
fluids, and he got better.

151
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,366
And I'm sure your tests
have come up negative,

152
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,335
or you'd have
shut me up already.

153
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,598
Which means he goes home.

154
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,265
There is a symptom.

155
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,436
Extreme altruism.

156
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,648
You've got two choices, House.

157
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,845
You can recognize
that your patient is just

158
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,048
a very nice, healthy guy
and send him home.

159
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,716
Or you can consider
altruism a symptom,

160
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,385
in which case,
you cannot take his money.

161
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,562
Send him home.

162
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,638
And check with admitting for the
net worth of all new patients.

163
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,146
I'm not coming back, House.

164
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,488
Technically,
you're back right now.

165
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,920
I need you to stop calling me.

166
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,895
The first 17 messages
were cute, but...

167
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,228
I'm putting
the band back together.

168
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,495
Interesting that you've never
showed up at my place,

169
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,162
what with your
love of annoying me

170
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,070
and your inability to
take no for an answer.

171
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,574
I'm guessing ankle monitor.

172
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:32,339
Guilty as charged.
Literally.

173
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,510
I'm not a doctor
any more, House.

174
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,613
The job went away
but not the profession.

175
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,758
You look healthy,
so that's not it.

176
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,426
You met a boy or a girl,

177
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,366
fallen in love, wanna be happy.

178
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,462
You've decided to enjoy
what time you have left.

179
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,940
You're going to Thailand.

180
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,304
Girl. And Mýkonos.

181
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,873
Turns out I like boring.

182
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,044
No, you want to like boring.

183
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,382
But if you
actually liked boring

184
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,946
you would have figured that out in
fifth grade when you were bored.

185
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,287
Please, stop calling me.

186
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,128
No.

187
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,565
You showed up to tell me that
you don't want to hear from me.

188
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,968
That's a mixed signal.

189
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,303
And I'm gonna choose to listen to
your actions rather than your words,

190
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,670
'cause they're more honest.

191
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,149
I'm a little confused.

192
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,481
The test is designed to
determine if your nerves are...

193
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,579
No, I meant you're running a
test and discharging me'?

194
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,989
Was I dehydrated or not?

195
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,994
I think so. But out of
an abundance of caution,

196
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,690
my colleague has taken it upon
herself to do one more test.

197
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,358
All right.

198
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,931
You scare me a little.

199
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,438
Why?

200
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,603
I've been considering applying
to Doctors Without Borders,

201
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,111
going overseas awhile,

202
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:12,843
and that seems like a huge
sacrifice, but you...

203
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,351
You don't scare her.
You make her feel guilty.

204
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,116
You like your life
the way it is.

205
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,126
Most people give the minimum
they have to give,

206
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,684
so they can enjoy
what they have left.

207
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,697
I guess my minimum is
just higher than most.

208
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,529
Complete recruitment
and interference pattern.

209
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,296
His leg muscles are fine.

210
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,633
I feel, uh, funny.

211
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,469
Where?
My chest.

212
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,408
You're tachycardic.
Your heart's beating too fast.

213
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,137
Unbelievable.

214
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,815
Patient got tachycardia to 185.

215
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,654
We pushed
18 milligrams adenosine.

216
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,853
There's definitely
something wrong with him.

217
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,056
Which is awesome. Now,
there's something to cure,

218
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,496
which means
there's something to be

219
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,433
disproportionately
financially grateful for.

220
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,765
Morning.
Got you coffee.

221
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,065
Thanks.

222
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,232
Arrhythmia could easily
have caused the collapse

223
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,437
that landed Father Teresa
here in the first place.

224
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,707
Oh, it's fine.
Keep it.

225
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,271
We looked at
his heart yesterday.

226
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,112
Didn't see any
structural abnormalities.

227
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,913
I'm thinking
occult long QT syndrome?

228
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,009
What about Whipple's?

229
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,579
If it was Whipple's, there'd be some
kind of neurological involvement

230
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,090
You don't think defying human
nature is neurological?

231
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,058
Racing heart,
medical condition.

232
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,959
Bleeding heart,
stupid condition.

233
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,621
Are you saying that
because you believe it,

234
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,360
or because it's in your
financial best interests

235
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,062
to think his generosity
isn't just temporary?

236
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,629
I'm told that some
people are just nice.

237
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,265
I'm trying to
embrace that wisdom.

238
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:47,368
Benjamin's been taking allergy
medication the last few weeks.

239
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,777
Long QT syndrome
can be medication-induced.

240
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,377
Flush him with saline. Get
rid of the antihistamines.

241
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,384
Then do an EKG.

242
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,442
No, wait.
I'll do the flushing.

243
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,451
And take the damn two dollars.

244
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,990
She hasn't even
sipped the coffee.

245
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,129
I just got so angry, you know?

246
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,758
So I made a terrible mistake,

247
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,667
and now, I'm trying
to start my life over.

248
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,831
To help people
the way I always wanted.

249
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:21,677
But my department got
defunded, and it's my fault.

250
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,443
I just can't stand to think of all
those patients going untreated

251
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:29,851
because I don't have the
resources to do my best work.

252
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,783
How about I help you out?

253
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,793
How do you mean?

254
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,654
I'll give a million dollars as
an endowment to the hospital

255
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:40,958
earmarked for Diagnostics.

256
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:43,959
Wow.

257
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:50,704
I'm an opportunistic ex-con who just
gave you a two-minute sob story

258
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,936
as step three
in my master plan,

259
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,344
and you've offered me
a million dollars.

260
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:57,881
Which was step 17.

261
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,042
Is that bad?

262
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,846
Ethics are not my strong suit.

263
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,987
Hypothetical.

264
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:14,623
If I'm offered oral sex from a
sexaholic, do I have to decline?

265
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:18,525
Don't answer yet. Saying "no"
will cause both of us pain.

266
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,365
Saying "yes" will
cause both of us pleasure.

267
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,869
You can't take sex
from a sexaholic,

268
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,999
you can't give
booze to an alcoholic,

269
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,566
and you can't take
this guy's money.

270
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,545
I could be wrong about the symptom.
I'm wrong all the lime.

271
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:33,515
Taking money from a sick person
is ethically suspect at best.

272
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,816
What is this? Canada? All we do
is take money from sick people.

273
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,911
We work for it.

274
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,011
I'm working.

275
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,817
How much?

276
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:42,852
$20.

277
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,328
Well, what if it was?
It's the same principle.

278
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,498
$20, a million,
what's the difference?

279
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,263
Actually, the difference is
pretty much a million dollars.

280
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,395
He came up with the
figure, not me.

281
00:14:56,095 --> 00:15:00,441
Crap. Got a patient with
end-stage renal disease.

282
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,274
Her heart can't
support dialysis.

283
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,405
She needs a transplant but...

284
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:07,451
You tuned out as soon as it stopped
being about you, didn't you?

285
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,076
What?
I got to go.

286
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:12,179
It's all moot. The patient
probably has long QT.

287
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,192
He's probably just a really,
really decent person.

288
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,454
They exist, right?

289
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,223
You can't take
the money, House.

290
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,561
Is long QT bad?

291
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:25,595
It's a tough thing to control.

292
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,365
Is there someone
you want me to call?

293
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,241
There's someone
I would like to call.

294
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:34,874
She's the same person
who won't take my calls.

295
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,480
My wife.

296
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,414
When I started
giving away the money,

297
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,715
I hoped she'd want
to do it with me.

298
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,655
She didn't.

299
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,150
I miss them.

300
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:52,994
I have two little boys.

301
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,667
Having a family doesn't exempt
me from social responsibility.

302
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,796
But family comes first.

303
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,066
But should it?

304
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,467
I know that sounds weird.

305
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:07,977
But if someone is
related to you,

306
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,138
does that empirically
make them more special,

307
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:11,840
more deserving
than anyone else?

308
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,579
Yes, it gives you
a responsibility.

309
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,486
My boys have a roof over their heads.
They're not starving.

310
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:23,989
I pay court-ordered
child support.

311
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,825
And frankly'
it's more than they need.

312
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,501
I love them more than anything.

313
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,663
I can't justify buying video
games and private schools

314
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,934
when other people's
children are starving.

315
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,639
I hope one day
they'll understand that.

316
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,281
Your hands are trembling.

317
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,715
Is it the electrodes?

318
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,183
Are you in pain?

319
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,845
No. What's happening?

320
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,980
I'm not sure, but it's not
what we thought it was.

321
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:01,996
So arrhythmia, fainting,
muscle tremors.

322
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,692
Plus unfortunately,
mental changes.

323
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,003
I still don't think
it's neurological.

324
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,201
God bless you.

325
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,143
He lost his wife and kids, 'cause
he couldn't stop giving money away.

326
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:20,344
He lost his wife, because she couldn't
accept not being filthy rich.

327
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,180
She's not drinking
the coffee either.

328
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:26,654
Drink it, don't drink it. The point
is I gave it to you, so we're even.

329
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,656
Even? It was a gift, an insignificant token.
There was nothing owed.

330
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,322
That was the whole point.

331
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:35,893
Why?

332
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,228
"Why?"

333
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:38,666
Yeah. Why?

334
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,833
She's the crazy one.

335
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,208
So a guy gives everything
away to strangers, sane.

336
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:48,734
Girl who doesn't want anything
from strangers, crazy?

337
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,177
You're not a stranger.

338
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,238
And your perverse
view of the world is

339
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,249
making you force
a neurological component

340
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,842
onto an obviously
cardiological...

341
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,910
Your parents
didn't love you enough,

342
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,921
so you need to
prove your superiority.

343
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,357
Or they loved you too much, so
you need to prove your humility.

344
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,691
Or it's just rich guilt.
I'm betting on the last one.

345
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,962
There's a whole list of drugs that
could have caused his symptoms.

346
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,766
I doubt the guy would
spend money on drugs

347
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,862
when there are orphans
out there without cable.

348
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,466
Anyway, he'd be getting
better right now, not worse.

349
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,102
Could be polyarteritis nodosa.

350
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,305
That comes with a rash.

351
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,542
Echovirus.

352
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,051
Virus, virus, virus...

353
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,647
Fits his physical symptoms.

354
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:35,055
And could, but doesn't necessarily,
cause personality changes.

355
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,552
Works for everyone?

356
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,126
Start him on antivirals.

357
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,490
And, Adams, when you treat,

358
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:46,434
and he gets better and doesn't give
Bob Cratchit Christmas Day off,

359
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,563
you owe me a coffee.

360
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,838
Click the
third tab from the left

361
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:55,105
and find a box that
says "previous entry."

362
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,805
<i>You get a drop-down
menu that's sorted</i>

363
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,007
<i>by patient name and department.</i>

364
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,914
Thank you.
I appreciate your help.

365
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,611
You're gonna read too much
into this, aren't you?

366
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,086
No. Not at all.

367
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,349
We're going to
fundamentally disagree

368
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,186
about what it means to read too
much into this, aren't we?

369
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,918
Yes, absolutely.

370
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,091
Look, I thought about what you said,
and I realized you were right.

371
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,258
Great.
See you tomorrow morning.

372
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,665
No, you won't.

373
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,301
Afternoon? I can't think
of another interpretation.

374
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,807
Shut up. Look, I'm not sure what
you were trying to achieve.

375
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,502
I'm never quite sure,
but you were

376
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,374
actually a friend to me
when I needed it.

377
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,381
<i>I don't want to come
back to work for you.</i>

378
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,875
But I was wrong to try
to push you out of my life.

379
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,719
Everything has gone blue.

380
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,450
<i>That's not supposed
to happen, right?</i>

381
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,654
Stay there.
I'm coming.

382
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,821
No, you don't have to do that.

383
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,490
Although if you did come, maybe you
could swing by the Hunan Palace

384
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,899
and get some Lo Mein
and a Szechuan Beef.

385
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,903
That is six miles
out of my way.

386
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:58,032
Okay, then, I guess I'll just get
something from the hospital cafeteria,

387
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,475
which is where I get all of my
meals since I can't go anywhere.

388
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,376
Fine.
I'll get the food.

389
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,471
<i>You're a peach.</i>

390
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,485
I started the last
round of pleconaril.

391
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:13,988
Can you do me a favor?

392
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,693
A favor?

393
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,162
You want me to return these?

394
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,726
Give them to someone? Wear
them while you masturbate?

395
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,329
I want you to have them.

396
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,406
That's not a favor.

397
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:36,537
It was a two-for-one sale I couldn't resist.
I need to justify buying them.

398
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,206
They're $120.

399
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,251
My car's in the shop. I'm
short on cash this month.

400
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,082
I can't pay you back.

401
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:47,749
The first pair were $120.
These were free.

402
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,386
You do know I punched the last
person that pissed me off?

403
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,256
Was it Santa?

404
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,312
What's your patient's status?

405
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,750
Better.
We're discharging him.

406
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,944
Good.

407
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,719
Hey' hey.
Why do you care?

408
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,487
Specifically. Although, I'm curious
about a general answer loo.

409
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,795
Your guy just signed up to donate a
kidney to my patient with renal failure.

410
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,000
Did he meet your patient
with renal failure?

411
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:38,439
No. He heard the nurses talking about
her, that she was short on time.

412
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,472
I was wrong.

413
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:45,674
Don't say that. House, she
really needs this kidney.

414
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,911
He's not better. His mental
status is declining.

415
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,820
Or he's doing an amazing thing
for another human being.

416
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,918
I thought it was
an ethical no-brainer

417
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,789
that we can't take
stuff from sick people.

418
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,592
I changed my mind.

419
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,003
He's still sick.

420
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,368
His symptoms have gone away.

421
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:14,535
Not all of them. Offering an organ
to a stranger is a symptom.

422
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,705
A couple dozen people a year make
undirected kidney donations.

423
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,511
How many of them are also in the
process of pauperizing themselves'?

424
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,984
If the guy threw himself on
a grenade, he'd be a hero.

425
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,985
If it saves a life, who cares?

426
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,115
You do. Yesterday when you made
the exact opposite argument.

427
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,158
If there's even
a chance I'm right,

428
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,854
it'd be dangerous to give
his kidney to someone else.

429
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:38,368
More dangerous than complete renal failure?
My patient needs this now.

430
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:39,800
Why do you want to
give away your kidney?

431
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,628
There are 70,000
people in this country

432
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,174
on the active Waiting
list for a kidney,

433
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,503
and less than 10,000 dead
people a year to give them one.

434
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:49,806
Yeah, if only We could kill
60,000 more people a year,

435
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,177
all would be golden.

436
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,338
I'll give you your money.

437
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,374
See? Crazy.

438
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,146
Being a live donor has risks.

439
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,815
I looked ii up. The risk is one in 4,000.
I could die during surgery.

440
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,825
Which means if I don't donate,

441
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,487
I'm valuing my life at 4,000
times someone else's.

442
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,387
It's not like
I want to be cut open

443
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,488
and have a part of me
taken out,

444
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,832
but I've got two, and this woman has none.
She'll die without it.

445
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,497
Perfectly logical.

446
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,666
People with mental
deficiency can be logical.

447
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,901
Just like sane people
can be illogical.

448
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,411
This kidney thing is the only
evidence you have that he's sick.

449
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:27,684
I'm going to
let him be a donor.

450
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:34,021
Dr. House,
it's not a symptom.

451
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,883
Come back after you're
convinced that I'm healthy,

452
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,859
and I will give you your money.

453
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:41,358
No, you won't.

454
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,970
We have time for one more
test before we move him.

455
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:50,199
What test?

456
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,708
Whatever test will prove
that it wasn't echovirus...

457
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:55,539
Virus, virus...
And he's not cured, obviously.

458
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,706
I've been saying all along
this could be Whipple's.

459
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,877
Causes arrhythmia,
tremor and mental changes.

460
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,581
Bad idea.
There's no joint pain.

461
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,654
Where's Adams?

462
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:06,882
We thought the case was over.

463
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,085
She has a job interview.

464
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:14,463
Why is she here?

465
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:15,964
Because I called her.

466
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,091
Bigger question is
why that worked.

467
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,732
I'm here because I have time,
and you have a crisis and...

468
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,501
We're too busy for
rationalizations.

469
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,166
Patient made a big downgrade
in his personal life.

470
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,936
He's probably not
eating all that healthy.

471
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,741
Magnesium deficiency?

472
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,741
Wait until they take him back
to his room, draw blood,

473
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,013
and do an expanded
electrolyte profile.

474
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,645
No, he hasn't had anxiety
or any trouble sleeping.

475
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:39,916
I think it's Whipple's disease.

476
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,152
Bad idea. He doesn't
have joint pain.

477
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,284
Joint pain is
common but not definitive.

478
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,159
Whipple's explains
all of his symptoms

479
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,026
including
the personality change.

480
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,656
And it would
respond to antibiotics,

481
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,257
which is why
he started to feel better,

482
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,802
which doesn't mean
he's not still sick.

483
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:57,001
You were right. Counts for
nothing if you can't defend ii.

484
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,303
Book a procedure room,
do an upper endoscopy,

485
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,937
and run a PCR test
for Whipple's.

486
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,112
Guilt.

487
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,183
You feel guilty about leaving.

488
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,653
Yes, I think that little of
you and that much of me.

489
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:13,883
You're nothing without me.

490
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:16,357
Not leaving me,
leaving humanity.

491
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,328
I'm going with my girlfriend,
the woman I love.

492
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,162
To have fun.

493
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,032
You're trying to
make me feel guilty,

494
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:26,694
because you're
saving lives here.

495
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:29,398
I think that's great. I'm proud
to have been a part of ii.

496
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:33,705
But now,
I just want to be happy.

497
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:38,244
Well, no one's
unhappy in Greece.

498
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,551
It just appeared
in the last few weeks.

499
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,679
He's having trouble holding
a pencil in school.

500
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,422
Does it itch?

501
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:50,758
Get anything different lately,

502
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,386
new baseball glove, new kitten?

503
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:54,589
The neighbors put in a pool,

504
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,666
so he's been spending
a lot of time over there.

505
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,861
But if it were
something in the water

506
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:02,030
it would be everywhere,
wouldn't it?

507
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:06,940
It is in the water.

508
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,204
He's allergic to chlorine?

509
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:09,869
No.

510
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,946
He's allergic to Summer Lilac.

511
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:18,110
That's my lotion,
and it's not in the pool.

512
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,690
No, it's on
the palms of his hands.

513
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:23,618
In the pool,
is the neighbor's daughter

514
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,125
or the neighbor's hot wife.

515
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,037
Here's some lube.

516
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:36,968
Sorry.
Too late for your eyesight.

517
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:50,553
Endoscopy didn't reveal any
lesions in the small intestine.

518
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,112
I'm running the PCR test now.

519
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:59,454
I found it in my office.
Appears to be a gift.

520
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,792
That can't be good.

521
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:02,957
Damn it.

522
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:04,466
You got her the job interview.

523
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:08,470
And that was supposed to be the end of it.
I don't take charity.

524
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,335
Good for you, you loon.

525
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,636
I don't like
owing people things.

526
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,007
So either you're so insecure

527
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,478
that you feel like you need to
always have the upper hand,

528
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:21,073
or you're so arrogant that the notion
of a favor is insulting to you.

529
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,344
Or it's your family, some kind
of immigrant pride thing.

530
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:26,518
I'm betting on the last one.

531
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:31,652
I just don't like it.
It makes me feel icky.

532
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,955
That's the reason?
Ickiness?

533
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,691
You never even
tried to analyze this?

534
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,200
That's even crazier
than the gift thing.

535
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:42,966
House. There's no sign
of tropheryma DNA.

536
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,331
It's not Whipple's.

537
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,173
We did what we could.

538
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,818
You sure you want to do this?

539
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:02,791
Relax. This is gonna
make me very happy.

540
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:22,740
Dr. Simpson, heart rate's 140,
and pressure's dropping.

541
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,074
Get him adenosine, stat.

542
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,809
Patient's unstable
Surgery's off.

543
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,516
Arrhythmia's back. He's on
heparin and stable for now,

544
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,718
but this could put him at
risk for stroke or embolism.

545
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,384
Maybe he got bit by a spider.

546
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,928
The symptoms can take up
to three days to manifest.

547
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,361
He'd have localized pain.

548
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,421
LCDD.

549
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:43,693
Almost always hits the kidneys.

550
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:48,004
Ah, Dr. Foreman,
perhaps you can help us.

551
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,002
I can't decide
whether to take out an

552
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,440
<i>I-told-you-so ad in
the New England Journal,</i>

553
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:55,910
or stay classy and just
spray-paint it on your car.

554
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:57,207
You're off the case.

555
00:28:58,337 --> 00:28:59,873
That seems like
an overreaction.

556
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,748
You dosed him. You couldn't
stand losing him as a patient,

557
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,377
so you faked a symptom
to prove yourself right.

558
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:05,547
That's idiotic.

559
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,119
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize.

560
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,922
I don't know
if you're power-crazed

561
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:13,758
or paranoid,
but I know she's right.

562
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,692
Two lives are in
the balance here.

563
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,133
House, I worked for you for seven years.
I know how you operate.

564
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:22,262
So when I see symptoms magically
show up right when you need them...

565
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:23,965
And I was your boss
for seven years,

566
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:27,202
and I know what a suspicious,
micromanaging hard-ass you are.

567
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:32,204
Why would I do this now, knowing you
can send me right back to jail?

568
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,272
What did you give him?

569
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:34,612
Nothing.

570
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,879
You can't prove otherwise.

571
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:40,116
So why don't you do
the smart thing here?

572
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:44,456
You're off the case. You no longer
have access to this patient.

573
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:48,591
You can't let him do this.

574
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,128
He's the boss.

575
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,065
And he's right.

576
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,843
I assume you dosed the patient

577
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:10,613
because you're really certain he
has a neurological condition.

578
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:14,180
I assume you're interpreting my
actions in the best possible light

579
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,485
because you didn't get the job.

580
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,159
What's with you and Park?

581
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:21,356
Nothing.

582
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:25,128
I expect my people to
lie better than that.

583
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,335
Either you're getting her gifts

584
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:30,270
because you want
her to like you,

585
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,933
in which case,
I don't like you.

586
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,944
Or you're getting her
gifts to screw with her,

587
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,176
in which case, I will be teaching
you my secret homie handshake.

588
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:43,351
I just... I thought
it was interesting

589
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,854
she couldn't
accept that coffee,

590
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:49,016
and I wanted to see
how deep it went.

591
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,115
But now?

592
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,287
Oh, now, I just wanna win.

593
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,630
What was in the box?

594
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:59,362
Gift certificate.
The spa.

595
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:04,704
That's not going to do ii. You're
up against a lifetime of training.

596
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,036
If you wanna win,
you've got to do

597
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,872
something she can't
possibly reciprocate.

598
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,813
You've got to push
her neuroses to the point

599
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,316
where even she thinks
that she's crazy.

600
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:29,231
One more favor, and I promise
I'll leave you alone forever.

601
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:30,823
Or I'm lying.

602
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,836
Either way, it's more interesting
than whatever you're doing now.

603
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:44,674
Can I help you?

604
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,008
I'm his wife.

605
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,846
We're separated.

606
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,912
I heard he was sick.
I just wanted to see him.

607
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,785
He's giving a kidney
to someone he's never met?

608
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,692
He wants to, yeah.

609
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,762
I know he's talked about you.

610
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,597
He's been alone all this time.

611
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,693
I'm sure it would mean a
lot to him to see you.

612
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:13,402
I wanted to spend
my life with him,

613
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:20,817
but I need to feel like he loves
me more than other people.

614
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:22,749
Like he loves our kids more.

615
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,646
Maybe that's selfish.

616
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,421
I should go.

617
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,607
Was that my wife?

618
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,109
I don't know.

619
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,006
Are you the guy,
the kidney donor?

620
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:58,744
There was a problem,
but I'm gonna try again.

621
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:01,580
Um...

622
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,648
To give it to the same lady?

623
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:04,920
She needs it.

624
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,859
Okay. Never mind.

625
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:09,091
Wait.

626
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:11,757
What do you want?

627
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,930
Uh, it's nothing.
It's just...

628
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:24,338
I have polycystic kidney disease,
and I need a transplant,

629
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:25,938
and they say
I don't have much time.

630
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,677
So when I heard that you
were willing, I just...

631
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,276
But I'm glad
it's going to someone.

632
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,783
I'll give it to you.

633
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,192
But you already promised
it to someone else.

634
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,289
I have another one.

635
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,859
Saving one life is good,
saving two is better.

636
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,366
You give away two kidneys,
and you die.

637
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:53,136
I could live on
dialysis for years.

638
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,142
Yes, and then you die.

639
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,546
And then I could donate my
other organs, heart, lungs.

640
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,974
I could save four
or five more lives.

641
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:23,897
Foreman's going to
need a diagnostician.

642
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,669
This guy is crazy.

643
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:35,511
Arrhythmia, muscle tremors,
and yes, mental changes.

644
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:38,349
If his heart doesn't rupture, he's
liable to rip it out and give it away.

645
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,618
You know,
the down vibe in here is

646
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:43,522
totally ruining my
Charlie's Angels fantasy.

647
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,694
And that haircut
isn't helping, either.

648
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,756
Seems like Graves disease
or some other thyroid issue.

649
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:53,529
Is she on the team now,
like, forever?

650
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:59,372
His thyroid levels were within
normal range when he was admitted.

651
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,633
Could be Coxsackie B virus.

652
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,041
No pericarditis.

653
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,445
What about porphyria? It's a
little weird without the rash,

654
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:07,039
but it fits all of
his other symptoms.

655
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:09,443
And if it's acute
intermittent porphyria,

656
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,543
that would explain why his
symptoms keep recurring.

657
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,987
Unlikely, but it's possible.
What else?

658
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:18,725
I said, "What else?"

659
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,624
Oh, for crying out loud.

660
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:43,409
There, that's better.
Now, what else?

661
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,953
Well, if there's nothing
better than possible,

662
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:54,122
then possible gets
upgraded to probable.

663
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:55,927
I'll start him on hematin.

664
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,295
No, I'll go.

665
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:07,108
So what's the answer?

666
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,772
Are you now on the team,
like, forever?

667
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,610
I don't know.

668
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,311
Because I was thinking
of ordering t-shirts.

669
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:18,877
I don't know, House. I mean,
what am I supposed to do'?

670
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:23,621
I trained to be a doctor. I know
how to take someone's pain away,

671
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,855
how to make a stopped
heart beat again.

672
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,628
We've brought people's
kids back, their husbands.

673
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,696
50 guilt?

674
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:38,002
Yes you were right You're always right.
I just...

675
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,003
I have the skills
to help people.

676
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:47,176
Is it okay for me to walk away from
that because I wanna just have fun'?

677
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:50,178
Obviously not.

678
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:04,060
How's your patient?

679
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,828
She died a few hours ago.

680
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:16,776
Thirteen's back.

681
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,005
No department, no money,

682
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,746
and somehow, you manage to
con her into hanging around.

683
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,412
I have a gift.

684
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,521
What?

685
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:34,857
It was a con.

686
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:36,858
The patient was faking?

687
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,861
No, I was.

688
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:46,440
I brought him in here under false
pretenses just to get his money.

689
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,472
I ordered a bunch of random
tests to keep him here.

690
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:54,073
One of them was a head CT
which uses iodine contrast.

691
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:55,550
You think he's
allergic to iodine?

692
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,310
No. Again.

693
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,319
Just don't interrupt me.

694
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,653
Thirteen was right.
This is a thyroid issue.

695
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,752
He has Plummer's disease.

696
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:16,101
He has a nodule in his thyroid.
It produces excess hormone.

697
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:19,904
<i>Not enough to test abnormal, just
more than his brain was used to.</i>

698
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,308
<i>Just enough to make him
irrationally generous,</i>

699
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,471
<i>make him
vulnerable to overheating.</i>

700
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:26,446
<i>Then you pumped
his body full of iodine</i>

701
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,108
<i>and kicked him
into thyrotoxicosis.</i>

702
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,346
<i>I said don't interrupt.</i>

703
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:34,412
<i>But yes, you're right. We take
out the nodule. He'll be fine.</i>

704
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:51,004
Two days, one surgery.

705
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:55,173
I now accept that
you are all better.

706
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:57,202
Where's my money?

707
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:58,610
You made me sick.

708
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:03,676
You were already sick. I just
made you much, much worse.

709
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:06,947
Seriously, the money.

710
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,551
You're not giving
it to me, are you?

711
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:18,060
When you're facing death,
some things come into focus...

712
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,525
My wife...

713
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,627
You love your family.
You want them back.

714
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:27,071
Your altruism was
always a symptom.

715
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,971
No, it wasn't.
I'm still gonna...

716
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,640
<i>Give less?
How much less?</i>

717
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:33,910
Just enough to spoil your kids?

718
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,177
No.

719
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,379
But they need it
more than people with TB

720
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,512
or children in Indonesia
with no eyes?

721
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:41,857
Diagnosticians
with hearts of gold?

722
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,826
I don't want to give you
money because you're an ass.

723
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,528
I was an ass last week.

724
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:56,032
I love my family.
I want to be with them.

725
00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:59,565
That doesn't make me
a bad person.

726
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:00,868
No.

727
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,410
It makes you a healthy person.

728
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:18,116
My mechanic called. Said
the work's been paid for.

729
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:20,196
You mentioned your
car was in the shop.

730
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,731
That's $4,500.

731
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:27,764
Smile and say thank you,
or I get you GPS.

732
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,367
You win.

733
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,236
Thank you.

734
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:52,221
Your car's getting fixed. You were right.
She went for it.

735
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,291
Good work.

736
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,793
Need a lift tomorrow?
Your car's still in the shop.

737
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,837
I don't take charity.

738
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,405
I'm just glad it's over.

739
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,069
Nothing is ever over.

740
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,765
Thirteen.

741
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:33,993
Need a minute.

742
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:42,836
You're fired.

743
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,011
Now what?
House, I'm starving...

744
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:46,446
I'm not joking.

745
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,008
You're fired.
Don't come in tomorrow.

746
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:50,142
House...

747
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:54,048
I can work with people who've
got nowhere else to go,

748
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:55,681
people who've got
something to prove,

749
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,623
people who just get off
on weird cases.

750
00:41:57,782 --> 00:42:00,888
Who I can't work with
is someone who's here

751
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,794
so she doesn't
have to feel bad.

752
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,361
You're trying to save me.

753
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:11,963
Yes, I think that little of
you and that much of me.

754
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:25,314
Okay.

755
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,024
Bye, House.
