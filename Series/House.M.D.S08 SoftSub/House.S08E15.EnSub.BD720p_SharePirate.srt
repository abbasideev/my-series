1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,680
You have to lift up
the sign so he can see it.

2
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,016
Evan.

3
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:17,518
Hey, buddy.

4
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,198
Aren't you excited
to see Uncle Brant?

5
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:21,231
No.

6
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,800
No?

7
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,061
I think you are.

8
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,797
I think something else
is making you upset.

9
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,139
You know I'm leaving soon.

10
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,705
And it's okay to be
upset about that.

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,405
But, hey, do you
remember what I told you

12
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,413
when we were watching
wrestling on Saturday night?

13
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,978
Yeah.

14
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,983
That you and Uncle Brant
are like the Reaper Brothers.

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,213
That's right.

16
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,853
And Uncle Brant has been
in the ring a whole year.

17
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:48,018
Now it's time
for Daddy to tag in.

18
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,392
And while I'm away, I need
you in your uncle's corner,

19
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:54,394
making sure he keeps
you and your mom safe.

20
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:56,900
Can you help me with that?

21
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,228
Good.

22
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:01,829
Now let's get ready
with that sign.

23
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:08,703
Now.

24
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,420
Okay.

25
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,761
Brant, what happened?

26
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,565
Captain, please step aside.
Sir, this is my brother.

27
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,804
What's going on?

28
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,897
PFC Macklin has been
charged with treason.

29
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,203
No, sir, there's
gotta be some mistake.

30
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,438
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,477
Brant!

32
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,220
Brant! Brant!

33
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,351
<i>We got visual
contact with that feed.</i>

34
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,587
<i>Possible hostile elements,
request permission to engage.</i>

35
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,927
<i>Stand by for orders.</i>

36
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,194
<i>Confirming multiple RPGs...</i>

37
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,997
Army apparently thought they
were clearing an insurgent hideout.

38
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,667
After this was leaked on
Saturday, the AP investigated.

39
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,705
<i>Confirms
authorization. Engaging.</i>

40
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:52,011
Thirty-four civilian
casualties. Six kids.

41
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,648
There'll be MPs stationed at every
entrance to the second floor,

42
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,120
as well as outside
his patient room.

43
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,214
No. Don't do that.

44
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,487
Every time there's people in uniform in
the cafeteria, they get served first.

45
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,194
Make sure your IDs
are clearly visible.

46
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,495
I'll speak with the cafeteria staff
about showing more disrespect.

47
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,336
20-year-old male. Generalized
tonic clonic seizures.

48
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,732
Army docs scanned for
structural abnormalities.

49
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:15,863
EEG was normal, so was...

50
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,135
Do you need me
to sign for this?

51
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,639
Let me know
if you need anything.

52
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:22,840
Like a transfer.

53
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,379
Typhus?

54
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,511
Patient has no hair.
Probably means no lice.

55
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,884
Leishmaniasis?

56
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:34,550
No fever. Why couldn't they take
care of him at a military hospital?

57
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,695
I think because they
wanted to annoy you.

58
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,055
Any other conscientious
objectors?

59
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:46,003
So I'm the only one who has
a problem with someone

60
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,437
whose duty is to protect
our country blowing...

61
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:52,608
Blowing the whistle is honorable,
precisely because it's not dutiful.

62
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,347
I'm sorry, you said "blowing." Maybe you
were going somewhere else with that?

63
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,507
He's a coward.

64
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,082
He risked his freedom.

65
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,120
He anonymously downloaded a
computer file from a secure page

66
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,585
and uploaded it
to an unsecure page.

67
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,682
Not exactly storming
Omaha Beach.

68
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:13,026
EEG was normal because he was
faking it to avoid going to prison.

69
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,958
Let's treat him
with not-medicine.

70
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,296
Give those back.
Come on.

71
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,136
You got 28.
You can share.

72
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,477
Somethings going on with House.
He just seemed off.

73
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,881
Didn't even notice that I walked
out of the room with this.

74
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,451
You began to suspect he was off

75
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:39,046
when he didn't notice the mug you
stole to see if he was off'?

76
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,552
What else didn't he notice that
you don't want us to notice?

77
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,893
Those are the same clothes
you wore yesterday.

78
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:50,227
And you got very defensive when
House took your birth control.

79
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,303
Who was he?
Or better yet, she?

80
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,067
Do I need to explain the
physiology behind birth control?

81
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,804
Attention deficit in a man
who has no attention deficits

82
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,641
has to be symptomatic
of something.

83
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:04,341
You're right. I'm thinking
either massive brain tumor,

84
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,984
or his soap got canceled
and he's distracted.

85
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,417
Could be dietary, Ref sum.

86
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:14,686
Or maybe he thinks you just have more
than one non-descript, white blouse.

87
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,757
Or serotonin syndrome?

88
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,494
I'm not saying
he's definitely sick,

89
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,329
I'm just saying
we should look into it.

90
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,993
No, we shouldn't.

91
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,597
If you believe House is sick,

92
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,038
it's only because that's what
he wants you to believe.

93
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,175
Let's go.

94
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,883
We think the long flight home
allowed clots to form in your leg.

95
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:43,948
Take this pill.

96
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,451
If you feel any numbness in
your leg after a few minutes,

97
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,515
it means we're right.

98
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,959
You should get comfortable because
you're gonna be here for a while.

99
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:58,132
While we wait,
can you tell me why?

100
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,800
It was the right thing to do.

101
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:06,642
There are reports that insurgents are
using your video to recruit new members.

102
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,703
Making the voting public aware of
what's really happening on the ground

103
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,407
will help bring our
troops home faster.

104
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,882
My brother's grunt
means he disagrees.

105
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,545
I think you're being naive.

106
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:18,655
And I know you took an oath.

107
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,887
If you want to influence
policy, run for office.

108
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:25,555
Dad raised us to believe that
exposing the truth is honorable.

109
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:26,926
Hayes likes to
follow the rules.

110
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,761
Yeah, because that's what
Dad taught us was honorable.

111
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,494
You were 10 when he died,
you can't possibly have any...

112
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,835
If Dad always believed in
blindly following the rules,

113
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,498
how do you explain Tora Bora?

114
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,672
My dad was commanding
a Special Forces unit.

115
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,838
He lost communication with his
men, they were assumed dead.

116
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:47,180
He was ordered to abandon them and
focus on the primary mission.

117
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,245
He disobeyed that order, went and found
his men, still alive and fighting.

118
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,846
He saved their lives.

119
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,357
Did he die in service?

120
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,755
If it was something genetic,
it could help us.

121
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,524
No, it won't help.
It was a one-car accident.

122
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,292
That's the Army's
official story.

123
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,368
My brother's naive
on this and...

124
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,296
I can't feel my leg.

125
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,540
I'll get the discharge papers.

126
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,940
I have a blood clot.

127
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,376
No you don't.
We gave you a placebo

128
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,211
to see if you'd fake another
symptom to delay going to prison.

129
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,046
Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second.
He's not faking.

130
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,456
Because that's not the
way your dad raised him?

131
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,223
Yes.

132
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,657
My stomach hurts, too.
What's going on?

133
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,063
He's not faking.

134
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,138
Just because he's
got abdominal bruising

135
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,078
doesn't mean he wasn't
faking the numbness.

136
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,980
He's not contesting
the treason charges.

137
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,575
If his code of honor
is that strong,

138
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,349
he's not going to
bother faking symptoms.

139
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:02,148
Pleading guilty isn't
honorable, it's just stupid.

140
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:06,590
A distal esophageal rupture can lead
to compartment syndrome in his thigh.

141
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:07,756
Explains both symptoms.

142
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,497
No pain when he swallows.

143
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:13,332
What is honor?
Dying for your country?

144
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,269
Getting straight A's?

145
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,275
Killing your daughter because she
had the audacity to get raped'?

146
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,774
Ruptured triple-A?

147
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,937
Doesn't explain the seizures.

148
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:25,949
Pancreatitis? Gallstones
obstructing his pancreatic duct.

149
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:32,951
People define honor with whatever
makes them feel honorable.

150
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,116
It's a circle going nowhere.

151
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,623
Which I guess is
what circles do.

152
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,731
We'll ultrasound his belly
and look for the obstruction.

153
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,971
Need your signature
on this order.

154
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,538
The Army's leaning on Foreman to
make sure this is done by the book.

155
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,374
Didn't need an order
for his last treatment.

156
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,470
His last treatment
wasn't a treatment.

157
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,143
Forge it.

158
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,809
I will. From now on.

159
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,215
But I need the original,
so I know what to forge.

160
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,991
We were having coffee
when the dizziness started.

161
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:09,416
Business meeting?

162
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,553
Date. Our first.

163
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,653
We met at the
Ninety Eight Cent Store.

164
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,859
We were reaching
for the same tube of cheese.

165
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:16,923
Huh!

166
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,831
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

167
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,234
I need to talk to you.

168
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,170
Just about done.

169
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,505
Good news. Based on her
thrifty shopping habits

170
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,741
and taste for artificial dairy,

171
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,441
she's clearly
not a gold digger.

172
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,018
Bad news.

173
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:39,452
Based on his
Rhinotillexomania, he is.

174
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,356
A compulsive addiction
to nose-picking.

175
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,425
A small out on the inside
of the left nostril

176
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,589
led to an infection
in the cavernous sinus.

177
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,092
It was very nice
meeting you, Mel.

178
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,630
It's not true.

179
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,807
Gloria, wait.
I can change.

180
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,046
My PPTH contract

181
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:10,285
House signed it six months ago.
He signed this today.

182
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,224
His hands are unsteady.

183
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:21,993
Given his Vicodin abuse, I think
he has hepatic encephalopathy.

184
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:25,232
He's been
forgetful, inattentive...

185
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,831
Dominika's been trying
out new knish recipes.

186
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,304
One of them didn't
agree with him.

187
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:33,138
A little sleep deprivation could account
for his forgetfulness and inattention.

188
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,406
He loads up on caffeine,
that explains a jittery hand.

189
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,569
Maybe.

190
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,007
But if I'm right,
his liver's in decline.

191
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:44,320
It's curable, but if he doesn't get
treatment, it could actually be fatal.

192
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,420
This happens all the time.

193
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,483
One of the symptoms
of working for House,

194
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,824
you start seeing
zebras everywhere.

195
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,432
There's nothing wrong with him.

196
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,602
House.

197
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,682
Shh! I'm with a patient.

198
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,120
Sleep study.

199
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:26,957
You drugged him?

200
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,468
Well, I didn't say
the study was voluntary.

201
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,571
I think you're sick.

202
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,636
What? Because I'm sleeping in
the clinic, like I always do?

203
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,314
Slow reaction time.

204
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:50,513
Because I just woke up from sleeping
in the clinic, like I always do.

205
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,815
You're forgetful.

206
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,415
Sorry, what did you say?

207
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,015
You forgot that we were
supposed to have lunch.

208
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:58,493
I didn't forget. I was
sleeping in the clinic...

209
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,030
I'd like to run some tests.

210
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,327
For what?
Where is this coming from?

211
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,194
Hepatic encephalopathy.

212
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,828
I've watched you destroy your
body with Vicodin for years.

213
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,498
I'm surprised your
liver's lasted this long.

214
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,841
I'll do the examination myself.

215
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:17,375
While having you juggle
my jewels sounds interesting,

216
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:20,179
there's no such thing
as friends with benefits.

217
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,116
It always gets weird.

218
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,388
Your friends out there are
getting a little handsy.

219
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,967
Get enough death threats, eventually
they start taking them seriously.

220
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,061
A convoy was hit
outside of Kunar Province.

221
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,799
Eight American
soldiers were killed.

222
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:48,078
Army spokesperson's claiming that it's
revenge for the attack that I made public.

223
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,737
Better me take
the blame than them.

224
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,475
You don't think
you're to blame at all?

225
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:55,917
And you do?
Like everyone else.

226
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:59,317
A strike like that would take
more than three days to plan.

227
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,722
So the next one
might be your fault?

228
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,926
Lateral view looks good.

229
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,427
If you have such a negative opinion
of the Army, why did you enlist?

230
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,999
I needed to find out what
really happened to my dad.

231
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,070
There were two redacted pages
in his service record.

232
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:19,841
Going into intelligence was the quickest
way lo up my security clearance.

233
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,240
Then why would you
leak that video?

234
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,276
Part of my job was to grab a
cup of tea with the locals.

235
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,079
The face-time is
supposed to make them

236
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,777
more likely to trust us
with sensitive information,

237
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,786
but they became my friends.

238
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,094
If there was another attack, civilian
casualties, and I had done nothing...

239
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,188
Your spleen. It's enlarged. We should
do a biopsy and look for any...

240
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,096
He's got urinary bleeding.

241
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,295
Not just urinary.

242
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,302
- I'll call the blood bank.
- What's happening to him?

243
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,872
His spleen must be
sequestering platelets.

244
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,543
He's bleeding loo fast to
wait for a platelet infusion.

245
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:59,048
We need to squeeze his spleen
to release the ones he's got.

246
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,118
Tell the OR we're on our way.

247
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,221
- Pressure's dropping.
- Almost there.

248
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,055
BP's 70 over 40,
and he's hypovolemic.

249
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,633
Pressure's rising.

250
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,633
And he's starting to clot.

251
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:30,512
Good news is we
can control the bleeding.

252
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:34,243
Bad news is,
bleeding's not the problem.

253
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,820
Unless spleens are
supposed to be lumpy.

254
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:46,160
He's clotting but CT
confirmed splenic nodules.

255
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,989
Dr. Taub has an
interesting theory.

256
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,056
No, I don't.

257
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,001
You're forfeiting?

258
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,395
If you can't play
the game and work...

259
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,001
Extramedullary hematopoiesis.

260
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:58,233
No history of anemia.

261
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,344
She's right. You're an idiot.
Try again.

262
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,243
Where I come from, this
is called "cheating."

263
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,511
Where's that?
Stickford-Upon-Anus?

264
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,073
TB.

265
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,517
PPD was negative.
Could be Bruce...

266
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,746
Don't interrupt
Dr. Taub.

267
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,688
Brucellosis.

268
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,553
You just took out
a family of four.

269
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,592
They were clearly
armed insurgents,

270
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,095
and anyone who claims
or proves otherwise

271
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,597
is a traitor.

272
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,360
No rash or back pain.

273
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,530
You defend the patient for
being a whistle-blower,

274
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,468
then attack him for being
an honorable whistle-blower,

275
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,441
now you defend him for being a
maligned, honorable whistle-blower?

276
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:36,103
Adjectives matter. Hate
nurses, love naughty nurses.

277
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,613
Taub, pitch again.

278
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,704
I've pitched like five...

279
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,114
It's your turn.

280
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,274
Lymphoma?

281
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:42,409
If cancer caused his seizures,

282
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,488
we would have seen cerebral
masses on his head CT.

283
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:45,612
TAUB; Yes!

284
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,050
Taub, pitch again. Now!

285
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,226
The nodules in his
spleen were granulomas.

286
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,565
He's got sarcoidosis!

287
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,763
Someone tell him he's wrong.

288
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,770
Sorry, House. Sarcoid does
explain the seizures.

289
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,131
And the bruises.

290
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,799
Say "bye-bye," House.

291
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:09,072
Yes! Yes!

292
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,285
Sarcoidosis it is.
Treat it with steroids.

293
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,253
Then come right back here,

294
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:24,261
'cause I'm not gonna rest until I've made
orphans of all your virtual children.

295
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,929
House never loses.

296
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:32,467
Seriously'? Me beating House
is medically significant?

297
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,196
It could be.

298
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:38,673
Reduced fine motor control. Add
that to inattention and liver flap.

299
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,608
It does make sense.

300
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,508
We have to talk to Foreman.

301
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,276
No, we don't.

302
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,979
First of all, because I can
beat him in that game.

303
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:52,885
And second, even if you are right,
there's no reason to believe

304
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,788
that House's medical
judgment is impaired.

305
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,291
So we should wait until he kills
someone for confirmation?

306
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,990
Do you really think it's a coincidence
that we're treating a whistle-blower

307
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,622
and now talking about
blowing the whistle on House?

308
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,802
You're right.
Playing dumb.

309
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,700
A messy signature.
Losing a video game.

310
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,831
It's way too
complicated to fake.

311
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,309
No. I won't take it.

312
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,482
Without this injection, you
could have a fatal arrhythmia.

313
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,355
Tell Major Mathewson that I'm
not taking any more treatment

314
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,757
until they give me a live
television interview.

315
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,557
You can't really think
they'll agree to that?

316
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,724
People need to know the tape's
not the reason for that attack.

317
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,323
They need to know
why I did this.

318
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,766
The people who think you're a traitor
will still think you're a traitor,

319
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,103
and the people who think you're a
hero will still think you're a hero.

320
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,900
The truth makes a difference.

321
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:49,707
If Dad were here, he'd be
begging for you not to do this.

322
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:53,581
If Dad were here,
he'd be proud of me.

323
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,426
The conspiracy theorists are gonna
go nuts if the patient dies.

324
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:13,902
I told him that, and he told me
that option is still less damaging

325
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,701
than giving the kid
a national platform.

326
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,933
So, what do we do now?

327
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,600
You explain to your brother
that he overplayed his hand.

328
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,042
Well, that won't
make any difference.

329
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,909
The idiot thinks he's
doing the right thing.

330
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,313
What if we convince
a court that his refusal

331
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,577
is part of an underlying
psychiatric disorder?

332
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,718
They assign a conservator,
we do what we want.

333
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,414
Fraud? Great.

334
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,558
Narcissistic
personality disorder.

335
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,890
Both the leaking of the tape
and the refusal of treatment

336
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,826
indicate that he has
no fear of consequences.

337
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:41,330
<i>So instead of defrauding
the court, you'll waste their time?</i>

338
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:44,899
No way a judge classifies a personality
disorder as a mental illness.

339
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,436
If a decorated
military officer,

340
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,962
who happened to be the patient's
brother, corroborates, they might.

341
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,178
So you want me to sign a piece of
paper that says my brother is crazy

342
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,575
for doing what
he thinks is right?

343
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:00,083
I want you to save his life. His
heart could go at any time.

344
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,684
He's a fool,
but he's not crazy.

345
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,791
The patient is refusing
treatment because of honor,

346
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,026
and his brother is refusing to be
his conservator because of honor.

347
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,667
Good, Taub's cured the patient.

348
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,840
I had to go to the bathroom.
Bathroom's that way.

349
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:24,202
You just ran in from that way.

350
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,604
That one's been out
of order for two days.

351
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,167
I had to go up
to the third floor.

352
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,275
I'm not lying.
It's out of order.

353
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,612
I believe you.
I'm going to fix it.

354
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,655
We could treat if he doesn't
know he's being treated.

355
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,189
Lace his sponge bath?

356
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,189
Would take too long
to reach his bloodstream.

357
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,122
What if we aerosolize
steroids and blast the room?

358
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,992
Speaking of which.

359
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:52,292
It'd be too hard to get the
prednisone concentrations right.

360
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,502
No one fixes anything unless
they have a compelling reason.

361
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,209
And if we're going to treat,

362
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,308
we have to give him
a compelling reason.

363
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,917
Something that he wants
more than an interview.

364
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,317
Fire in the hole!

365
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:14,488
A signed order
from Major Mathewson.

366
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,887
They've agreed to declassify
the redacted pages

367
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,723
from your father's
service record.

368
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,557
In two days, you'll
have all your answers.

369
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:24,533
But the only way you'll live long enough to
get the truth is by accepting treatment.

370
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,665
I don't trust the Army
to follow through on this.

371
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,834
But you trust me.

372
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,111
I'll make sure
those pages get here.

373
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:41,845
Okay.

374
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,219
Selfishness is apparently
honorable now.

375
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,124
He wanted to create change, instead
he's just satisfying his own curiosity.

376
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,392
He's getting the truth.
Most he could hope for.

377
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,229
I need to take a dump.

378
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,700
Specifically, House's dump.

379
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,905
You set this up?

380
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:16,386
All it took was showing up two
minutes late and a $2 sign.

381
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,924
Bile deposits are irregular.

382
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,064
House's liver is failing.

383
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:40,937
Cognitive impairment will
get progressively worse.

384
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,821
What's going on?

385
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,949
My foot.
It's killing me.

386
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,292
It's completely cyanotic.

387
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,952
This isn't sarcoidosis.

388
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,866
Cholesterol embolization?

389
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,175
Are you even going to acknowledge
what we just told you'?

390
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,802
That you pilfered
my poo-poo?

391
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:20,343
Yeah, I was thinking it would
be less awkward for all of us

392
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,975
if we could just pretend
that never happened.

393
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,147
It's not an embolization. No
instrumentation inside the arteries.

394
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,485
Thank you for
getting us back to...

395
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,683
And if we start you on treatment
now, get you off Vicodin...

396
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:32,956
What's the opposite of "thank you"?
Pretty sure it ends in "you".

397
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:34,859
I know my body.
I'm fine.

398
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,400
Methemoglobinemia.

399
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,167
Army tests for G6PD deficiency.

400
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:46,872
If you're not sick, then our tests
accurate 99.5% of the time,

401
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:49,537
yielded a false positive,
three separate times.

402
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,308
The odds of that are
one in eight million.

403
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,381
The test is accurate.
The diagnosis isn't.

404
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,353
The sample was obviously
contaminated by other foods

405
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,047
interacting with
my liver enzymes.

406
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,851
Now, can we talk
about the sick patient?

407
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:03,723
His clot dissolved. That could
have caused the vasospasm.

408
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:07,991
And DIC could have been caused
by Bernard Soulier Syndrome.

409
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:12,535
And you're sick and you have
to do something about it.

410
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,034
If we got a patient file with the
same symptoms you're exhibiting...

411
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,435
And the symptoms
I'm not exhibiting?

412
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,271
Jaundice, ascites,
fetor hepaticus.

413
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:23,745
We can't tell if your breath stinks
because you've been popping mints

414
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:24,904
like they're Vicodin.

415
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,245
And you would still
diagnose hepatic encephalopathy.

416
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:30,616
I know that because four doctors you
trained have unanimously diagnosed you

417
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,052
with hepatic encephalopathy.

418
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,920
Park's right. Treat the
patient with heparin.

419
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:55,440
We'll have a stronger argument if
we go to Foreman as a united front.

420
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,411
We'll have a stronger argument
if we have an argument.

421
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,084
If House is sick, it's his
business, not Foreman's.

422
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,053
Foreman's business is to make sure his
doctors are able to do their jobs.

423
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,645
That lives aren't put at risk.

424
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,655
Telling Foreman
will put lives at risk.

425
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:11,617
We tell Foreman, House either agrees
to treatment or gets suspended.

426
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,491
Which means House
gets suspended.

427
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,223
And considering House at 90%

428
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,458
is better than any other doctor
at this hospital at 100%

429
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,901
that means our patients
get a lower standard of care.

430
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,134
House could be at 90%, he could be at 60%.
We don't know.

431
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:27,802
And until we do, there's no reason to
do anything more than what we've done.

432
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:38,511
Blurry vision, headache,
bit of nausea and dizziness.

433
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,087
I am completely baffled.

434
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:42,990
I only had eight beers.

435
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:46,953
Sophomore class pong
tournament's in a week.

436
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,464
I'm working on my tolerance.

437
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:55,830
Hop on one foot and sing
the iCarly theme song.

438
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,002
Like you don't know it.

439
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,186
Damn it, man, can't you
see I'm doctoring'?

440
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:22,231
If you want to talk to me' you can
buy me a sandwich in an hour.

441
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,626
Or I can just hover here
until you're done.

442
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:32,066
Heard enough. Just never could
figure out the "breathe air" part.

443
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:33,802
Next year, stick to whiskey.

444
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,870
Or at least stay away
from week-old green beers.

445
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:40,746
A lot less likely to contain
tartrazine-laced green food dyes

446
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,978
for which you apparently
have an intolerance.

447
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:47,924
Once you break the seal, should be
out of your system in 48 hours.

448
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:55,491
What are my choices here? If I tell
you I'm fine, you won't believe me.

449
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,090
I've scheduled
a liver function test.

450
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:01,170
If I ignore you, then you'll
just ignore my ignoring.

451
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,762
Which is rude, frankly.

452
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,933
Depending on the results, we'll
customize a treatment plan.

453
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,841
If I tell you I think I'm
sick and I need your help

454
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:13,907
and we need to setup a time to talk
about it, you'll just assume I'm lying.

455
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,543
Again, rude.
Also hurtful.

456
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,622
Why is it that you can find the
smallest thing wrong with anyone else,

457
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:20,883
but when it comes to you...

458
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,085
I really don't have
a choice here, do I?

459
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:24,855
No. You don't.

460
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,227
I'm on the list He's not.

461
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,364
You can't ignore me forever.

462
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,093
Well, if you're right it's
not gonna be all that long.

463
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,637
Do it slow.

464
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:50,545
Who are you?

465
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,254
Well, considering the only
people allowed in this room

466
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,756
are your doctors
and your family,

467
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,892
I'm your long-lost
cousin Ralph.

468
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,899
So glad to finally meet you.

469
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,426
Are you going to check on me?

470
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:10,969
It's gonna be at least two hours until
we can tell if the heparin's working.

471
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,166
Then what are you doing here?

472
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,105
My father taught me

473
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:19,274
that it's dishonorable to interrupt
someone while they're reading.

474
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,611
Honor is not a punch line.

475
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,486
Get out of my room.

476
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,350
So, was it worth it?

477
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:33,123
Best case, you spend the rest
of your life in Leavenworth.

478
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:35,994
Worst case' you spend the
rest of your life here.

479
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:40,793
Justice for 34 deaths outweighs
anything the Army can do to me.

480
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,633
They got justice?
Do they know that?

481
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,600
What if only 10 people
had died? Four?

482
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,202
Even one civilian death is...

483
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:52,373
What if they had just maimed a few guys.
Would that have been worth it?

484
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,316
My job was to log that tape,

485
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:59,517
get all the details
in the official record.

486
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,883
After the 10th time
of watching it,

487
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,323
I stopped trying
to convince myself

488
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:09,059
that the shovel could have
been mistaken for a gun

489
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:12,001
because all I could see
were the victims' faces.

490
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:17,732
All I was doing was trying to read that
kid's lips to make out his last words.

491
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,033
I couldn't sleep.

492
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:23,002
Couldn't eat.

493
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,472
Think I like the cue ball look?

494
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,145
My hair turned
gray in three days.

495
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,982
My body was telling me
I had to do whatever I could

496
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:38,594
to make sure that something
like this never happened again.

497
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:45,393
Your hair turned
gray in three days?

498
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:52,005
Loss of hair color indicates an autoimmune
condition, likely Graves disease.

499
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:56,843
Hyperthyroidism leads to
a hypercoagulable state

500
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:58,940
which causes thrombosis.

501
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,550
Start him on
anti-thyroids.

502
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:02,517
You want to reject
our current diagnosis

503
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,077
because he had
a few gray hairs,

504
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,521
panicked and shaved his head?

505
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:11,254
I want to reject our current diagnosis
because I think we're wrong

506
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,421
and treating for
wrong diagnoses

507
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,361
can result in side
effects, like death.

508
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:19,197
Even if he did fully go gray, stress
seems Way more likely than Graves.

509
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,795
I haven't read any journal
articles proving that veterans

510
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,873
have a higher incidence
of depigmentation.

511
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,409
But, of course, that could be the
hepatic encephalopathy talking.

512
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,308
Our treatment for Bernard
Soulier hasn't had“.

513
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,572
So you all want to just
ignore the new symptom?

514
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:33,148
It's not Graves because
it's not a symptom at all.

515
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,774
And the anti-thyroids
you want

516
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,716
could reduce his blood pressure
and his ability to breathe,

517
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,222
which could result in
side effects, like death.

518
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,823
Small soda.

519
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:46,059
Graves it is. Start
him on anti-thyroids.

520
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,928
I know we disagree
with House all the time,

521
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:56,630
but before I could say,
"Okay, he's a genius."

522
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,002
Now?

523
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,408
Maybe he's just really smart.

524
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,975
We're not gonna give
him the anti-thyroids.

525
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,864
Feeling okay?
Any better?

526
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,193
Pretty good.

527
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,098
He did just ask
me for a blanket.

528
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,193
You're cold?

529
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,295
A little.

530
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,863
For how long?

531
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,709
It's really nothing.
Maybe an hour or two.

532
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,206
He's at 104.

533
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,714
It's not Bernard Soulier.

534
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:51,851
Bold move.

535
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:55,961
You've gone from speculating that
I'm sick, to acting like I'm dead.

536
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,228
We acted like we don't
trust your judgment,

537
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,496
because we don't
trust your judgment.

538
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,696
Why don't you start by
not trusting your own?

539
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:05,536
We did more blood work.
It's not Graves either.

540
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,670
Talk to you for a minute?

541
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,709
Anything you have to say to
me, you can say to them.

542
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,310
It's only fair, considering
anything they say to me,

543
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,478
they also say to you.

544
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,885
Jiggle your pockets.
Who's got the silver coins?

545
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:24,225
Until you receive
a clean bill of health,

546
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,353
I'll be authorizing
all treatment orders.

547
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:35,366
I would say that that was an
incredibly stupid mistake.

548
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:38,531
But apparently I'd have to clear
that opinion through Foreman first.

549
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,205
White count is high,

550
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,009
so all the infections we ruled out
when he came in are back on the table.

551
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,015
Legionnaires'?
Unlikely without pneumonia.

552
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,675
Taub?

553
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,845
Loyalty issues in
his personal life

554
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,583
make sense if they cross over
into his professional one.

555
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:56,724
<i>I was hoping we could get a
 diagnosis before the witch-hunt.</i>

556
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:00,420
The patient's infection is an
inherently less interesting puzzle

557
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,258
than the stab wound in my back.

558
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:06,130
Fine. I told Foreman.
Can we move on now?

559
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,225
What about dengue?

560
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,896
Patient isn't in enough pain.

561
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,028
Nope!

562
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,375
I don't mean about dengue,
I have no idea.

563
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,768
Taub's only confessing 'cause he
wants us to focus on the patient.

564
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,703
I told Foreman.

565
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,804
I did.

566
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,941
The next person
to confess is fired.

567
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,309
Or Spartacus.

568
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,445
For clarification,
no one's getting fired.

569
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,249
<i>Who else has a pitch?</i>

570
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:29,723
And then there's Park?

571
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,555
The only one who
didn't confess.

572
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:34,397
And the same cowardice,

573
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:37,397
that makes someone unable to move
out of Mommy and Daddy's home,

574
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,333
might also make
someone a tattletale.

575
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,404
You threatened to fire
the next person who...

576
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,406
And it's malaria.
No, it's not.

577
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,275
The Army issues
anti-malaria medication.

578
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:47,672
And has done for 10 years.

579
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:49,803
That's the equivalent
of 5,000 generations

580
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:52,643
<i>of the Afghan mosquito,
Anopheles gambiae.</i>

581
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:54,751
It's plenty long enough
to develop a resistance.

582
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:58,115
Anopheles, by the way,
ifs Greek for "useless".

583
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:02,452
Cover for intra-abdominal sepsis
and treat with antimalarials.

584
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:08,261
And was I also right
that it was a stupid idea?

585
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,098
We believe you have malaria.

586
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,534
These pills...

587
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:16,265
I don't want any medication.

588
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,109
My dad's file
should've been here.

589
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:24,102
Brant, I told you. I looked into it.
There's just a delay.

590
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,841
I believe that's what
the Army's saying.

591
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,518
I don't believe it's true.

592
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,447
If they're not going to keep
their end of the bargain,

593
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:38,283
neither am I.

594
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:46,162
So, we got groped for nothing?

595
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,292
If he doesn't
want to stay alive...

596
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,360
Hold on.

597
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,168
Is it too late to
become his conservator?

598
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,069
I know what I said before.

599
00:33:58,303 --> 00:33:59,907
Right now, I don't care.

600
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:04,080
Of course not. We'll get
the paperwork drawn up.

601
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,095
He changed his mind?

602
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:24,063
Why?

603
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,835
His brother's dying. He needs
a more substantial reason?

604
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:30,209
His brother was dying the last time
we asked him to be the conservator.

605
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:33,212
So instead of pushing the issue
with the Army to get that file,

606
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:35,716
he just decided to
give up on his code?

607
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,621
Apparently.

608
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,222
So, where do I sign?

609
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:50,623
We don't need you to.

610
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:54,527
The Army gave the file
to you yesterday.

611
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,438
Major Mathewson had another
copy sent over to us.

612
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:06,413
Uh... You know, there's a reason I
didn't want that file released.

613
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,974
I know. I read it.

614
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,481
I'm going to treat
my patient now.

615
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:23,430
I was right.

616
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:25,591
Wasn't I?

617
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,341
How did he die?

618
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:43,613
What did they cover up?

619
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,757
They didn't cover up anything.

620
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:53,652
I did.

621
00:35:57,122 --> 00:35:59,602
Dad died in that car accident
because he was drunk.

622
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,830
Killed a pedestrian, too.

623
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,873
What are you... I...

624
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:09,377
He drank, Brant, a lot.
You were too young to see it.

625
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:20,785
I had some of Dad's buddies
take care of his files.

626
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,829
It's the only time
I ever broke the rules.

627
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:33,826
I'm sorry.

628
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,980
Can I begin treatment?

629
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,688
Fever hasn't broken.

630
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:01,424
White count is still up,
renal function is declining.

631
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,157
So, he has
all the signs of malaria,

632
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,223
except the antimalarials
aren't curing him.

633
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:08,270
Gonorrhea? If it got
into his heart...

634
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,499
We did an echo. His valves look good.
What about...

635
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,001
You bastard.

636
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:17,874
You were faking.

637
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:24,119
Yesterday, House stole candy
by putting it into a cup.

638
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:27,088
The cup was too small, so his solution
was to remove some of the candy.

639
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,681
But the obviously logical thing
was to just get a bigger cup

640
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,056
which he did today

641
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,785
because he's no longer faking.

642
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,386
He couldn't have faked ii.
We tested your...

643
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:38,730
I took St. John's Wort to alter the way
my liver metabolized acetaminophen.

644
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,629
Then some N-acetylcysteine
just to finish it off.

645
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:46,766
You tortured them to torture me
just to see who you could trust?

646
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,140
I did it to save lives.

647
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,704
God, I wish I could
rationalize that one.

648
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:56,047
And now you're gonna brilliantly
deduce which one of us is the rat?

649
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,114
What makes you think
I haven't already?

650
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:11,757
To be continued. I need to
brilliantly cure a patient.

651
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,670
No hair usually means no lice.

652
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,970
What we didn't account for
was that it wasn't your hair.

653
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:26,410
Tea was not the only thing that your
Afghani neighbors shared with you.

654
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:29,512
I'm sure they were generous enough
to let you sit on their furniture

655
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,917
which was infested
with rat lice.

656
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:33,612
You have typhus.

657
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,255
Caused the vasculitis and
explains all your other symptoms.

658
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,827
But here's where
it gets interesting.

659
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:44,925
One of those symptoms, a lawyer
might argue, was leaking the tape.

660
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,596
There are psychiatric issues
associated with typhus.

661
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:53,371
And if you change your mind, plead
not guilty, you've got a case.

662
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,804
I'd be undermining everything
I've been trying to do.

663
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:03,046
You did what you
thought you had to do.

664
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,389
Going to jail proves nothing.

665
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,482
It proves I still
have my honor.

666
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,459
You're not doing
this for honor,

667
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,526
you're doing this
to please your father.

668
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:26,973
And the pathetic thing is, is that the man
you're trying to please never existed.

669
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,993
Traitor.

670
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:51,097
You've been avoiding
me for two days.

671
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,563
Because when I stranded you
behind the barricades,

672
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:54,898
you went straight to Foreman.

673
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:58,236
I've been avoiding you
because you're an ass.

674
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,869
I've been an ass my whole life.
I can't get rid of you.

675
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:04,436
You can get rid of me now.
Just turn and limp away.

676
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:07,038
Hun!

677
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:11,551
Your whiny righteousness
has the stench of sincerity.

678
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,022
Fine. I'll have to
punish my whole team,

679
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,888
so one of them
will step forward.

680
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,588
Makes sense.

681
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,424
Damn. Now I'm gonna
have to punish my whole team

682
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:25,967
so one of them
will step forward.

683
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:27,297
You just said that

684
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,029
Yeah, but I meant it this time.

685
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,036
First time, I was
just testing you.

686
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:36,635
Either you were gonna genuinely
confess or falsely confess'

687
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,407
or actually...

688
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:31,791
His name's Li'l Chase.

689
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:35,935
He's a rat.

690
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,767
You're a rat.
Get it?

691
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:46,847
Taub confessed to telling
Foreman to protect the patient.

692
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:49,441
Adams confessed
to protect Taub.

693
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:52,820
Your confession
was just piling on.

694
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:55,182
There was no rational reason
for you to have done ii.

695
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:58,192
And my punishment
will be nothing.

696
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,353
You wanted me to tell Foreman.

697
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,896
Your ability to solve puzzles is the
only thing that matters to you.

698
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:08,462
And you're smart enough to know even
you'll lose your edge at some point.

699
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,531
You want to make sure
someone's there when you do.

700
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,978
If that were true,

701
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:21,408
why are Li'l Chase's
little cousins

702
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,844
scurrying through your apartment
floorboards right now?
