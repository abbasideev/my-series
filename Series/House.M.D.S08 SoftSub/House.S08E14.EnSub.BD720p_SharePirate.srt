1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,311
I'm telling you, Will, you
got a real winner here.

2
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:05,943
She's just gonna love it.

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,450
Stacy?
Box her up.

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,120
Just the box.

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,850
I'm sure it's prettier
than the paper.

6
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,528
One tiny rock.

7
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,796
So many other cool things I
could have bought for myself.

8
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:29,497
Sam, Stacy, it's been a pleasure
being ripped off by you.

9
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,210
Such a nice boy.

10
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,680
Too bad he's a handicap.

11
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,728
Excuse me.

12
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,106
Thank you.

13
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,877
Just calm down.

14
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,988
Kid's a blind diabetic.

15
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,852
He's hyperglycemia
hyperosmolar.

16
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,657
Which is what we thought

17
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,427
until his blood tests showed a
controlled sugar level and no ketones.

18
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,167
Could be caused by drug abuse.

19
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,827
His tox screens were clean.

20
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,269
<i>You lying sack of crap.</i>

21
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,103
I have them right in front me.

22
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,640
Not you. This time.

23
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,443
My former BFF.

24
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:51,640
He's S.M.l.T.B.A.W.S.

25
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,546
<i>Stabbing me in the back
as we speak,</i>

26
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:55,676
Where exactly are you'?

27
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,353
If anyone should happen to ask,

28
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,458
I'm at an out-of-state medical
conference till further notice.

29
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,821
Why would any...
And don't really care.

30
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:06,396
Auditory hallucinations and disorientation
could be signs of schizophrenia.

31
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,693
They did a psych consult.
Mental status is normal.

32
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,292
A seizure?
Noise-induced epilepsy.

33
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,665
The sound of rush hour traffic
could have set it off.

34
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,137
Run an EEG,

35
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,300
and blast his brain
with harmonics to find out.

36
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,406
Also, if anyone should
further happen to ask,

37
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,639
I spent the whole of
last year in Africa

38
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,873
<i>with Doctors
Without Boundaries.</i>

39
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,006
Who are you hiding from?

40
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,850
Evil.

41
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:36,983
Where's House?

42
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,527
Uh... He's at an out-of-state
medical conference.

43
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,532
In Baltimore, I think.

44
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,906
Nice to meet you. I'm Blythe.
His mother.

45
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,581
Do you want me to pick up the
Braille writer and laptop

46
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,121
from your apartment?

47
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,849
I don't plan on
being here that long.

48
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,754
I didn't eat lunch yesterday.
I probably just fainted.

49
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,692
Or had an epileptic seizure.

50
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,757
Which is only one possibility.
I'm Dr. Chase.

51
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,358
We'd like to discuss your
case with you privately.

52
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,529
I'm his girlfriend. Is it all
right if I stay for this?

53
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,403
Melissa can stay, and I've never
had a seizure before in my life.

54
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:26,102
They can be mild, like a loss of
concentration or a muscle tremor.

55
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,204
A lot of times a family member
notices before the patient does.

56
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,547
I'm Dr. Park, by the way.
I'm 5'2", Asian,

57
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,884
and I'm totally cool with it
if you want to feel my face.

58
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,287
Blind people only
do that in movies.

59
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,383
But you sound nice,
so if you want me to...

60
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,254
Her point was you may not have
realized you were having a seizure,

61
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,888
but maybe your girlfriend has.

62
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,456
No.

63
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,900
But I haven't seen him
for the last five months.

64
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,432
We were on a break.

65
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,803
Like Rachel and
Ross on Friends.

66
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:01,243
Never seen the show myself,
but I hear it's good.

67
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,741
That joke usually
kills my blind friends.

68
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:06,941
Will, this is serious.

69
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,917
No, it's not, since
I don't have epilepsy.

70
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,786
I have to pay attention to every
signal my body sends or receives

71
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,824
or I end up taking a dirt nap.

72
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,917
You don't think I'd know
if I was having seizures?

73
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,426
It was probably
just low blood sugar.

74
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,861
If that's true, then you shouldn't
have a problem passing our test.

75
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:27,034
How is he, James?
Really.

76
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,373
He's better than I've
seen him in along time.

77
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,034
Is he happy?

78
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,944
It's okay.

79
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:38,644
He's always been
a complicated child.

80
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,642
Were you in the
hospital recently?

81
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:46,050
Nothing serious. I just had a
few moles removed yesterday.

82
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,318
I forgot I even had it on.

83
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:54,394
Look, if Greg happens to get
back early from the conference,

84
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,903
I'm staying at a hotel in
town for the next three days.

85
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,172
I would like him to call me.

86
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,237
<i>I will pass it on.</i>

87
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:06,333
Thank you.

88
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,847
Do you think that they would mind
if I got a refill for the road?

89
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,814
Not at all.
Good.

90
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,702
Not seeing any seizure activity in
response to low frequency sounds.

91
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,712
I'm starting him
on mid-range.

92
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:47,284
Have you seen his girlfriend'?
Extremely hot.

93
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,415
Blind people can't have
attractive girlfriends?

94
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,614
Not my point.

95
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:55,124
He actually convinced her to go for
the whole relationship break thing.

96
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,785
How do you know
it wasn't her idea?

97
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,692
Because she's back with him.

98
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,222
Women suggest a break when
they want to break up.

99
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,358
Men do it because they want to have sex
with other women before they settle down.

100
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,628
They're a little young to get
married, don't you think'?

101
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,900
I was their age when I did.

102
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,076
I see your point.

103
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:15,471
He's seizing.

104
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:17,704
The sound frequency's
at 300 hertz.

105
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,382
It's not a seizure.

106
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,749
He's not spiking on his EEG.

107
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,889
And not moving air. I think
he's choking on something.

108
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:33,059
Blood, but I don't
see any blockage.

109
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,894
Help me move him.

110
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,066
Just relax and breathe.

111
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,115
What are these?

112
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,422
Three teeth detached from his jaw
bone and lodged in his throat.

113
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,090
He almost choked
to death on them.

114
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,295
Environmental? Could be heavy metal
poisoning or radiation exposure.

115
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,031
Then he wouldn't
be the only one.

116
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,700
He's an accountant who works on the
same floor with 50 other people.

117
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,641
Maybe his girlfriend
poisoned him.

118
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,177
House usually thinks
that's a good guess.

119
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,718
And she's gotta be pissed off
and have low self-esteem.

120
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,551
Why else would she give him a
free pass to pork other women?

121
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,816
<i>Because he's handicapped.</i>

122
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,620
<i>Women feel sorry for us.
This cane is tail-bait.</i>

123
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,693
Where are you now?

124
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,388
You expect an actual
answer this time?

125
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:42,695
<i>Hi, guys. Was wondering
if House's mother left yet.</i>

126
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,029
<i>He won't let me
go to our house...</i>

127
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,001
<i>It's not environmental.
It's periodontitis.</i>

128
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,470
An oral infection
doesn't explain

129
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,665
his disorientation and
auditory hallucinations.

130
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,801
<i>They're laughing 'cause they know
diabetes exacerbates the condition.</i>

131
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,039
It could progress
to a systemic disease.

132
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,343
The bacteria spread
and affect other organs.

133
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,418
<i>Like his brain. Stan him
on broad-spectrum antibiotics</i>

134
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,920
<i>and book him an appointment
with a periodontist.</i>

135
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,421
He has fake children now, too?

136
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:13,521
You think I'm not good
enough for your mother.

137
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,428
Not in front of
the kids, honey.

138
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:26,004
Add a couple of flies, toss in a dead
goat or two and we might have a winner.

139
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,011
Is she gone?
Yeah.

140
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,543
We really need to talk.

141
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,447
Okay.

142
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,780
Crayons down. Line up
if you want to get paid.

143
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:45,195
It's the only time I ever
successfully lied to my mom.

144
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:48,061
Is with elaborate
preparations and props.

145
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,896
Hey, hey, hey...

146
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,032
I said no Transformers, slick.

147
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,141
Stay here until
the coast is clear.

148
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,577
Fine.

149
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,808
But you sleep on couch tonight.

150
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,044
You're sleeping with her now?

151
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,144
Just in case an INS guy comes
in through the window.

152
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,779
Yeah, she didn't buy it either.

153
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,790
You need to talk
to your mother.

154
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:15,825
When I'm ready.

155
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,451
I still need to get
a fake passport,

156
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,461
doctored photos,
maybe a case of AIDS.

157
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,587
She's sick, House.

158
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,434
Did she say that?

159
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,665
She was wearing a hospital
admission bracelet

160
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,901
and carrying around a book on
dealing with terminal cancer.

161
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,943
I'm sorry.

162
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:43,085
She's staying at the Grand
for the next three days.

163
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,298
The antibiotics will stop the
infection from spreading further.

164
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,269
And I'll spare you the lecture you'll
get from the periodontist tomorrow

165
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:05,309
but you need to practice
better oral hygiene.

166
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,876
So, are you guys saying this is happening
because, what, I didn't floss enough?

167
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,644
Probably didn't help, but diabetics
are prone to this type of infection.

168
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,845
Half the time he doesn't even bother
getting undressed before he goes to bed.

169
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,048
I can only imagine how many times
you've skipped brushing your teeth

170
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,715
since we...

171
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,320
Sorry.

172
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,960
I don't mean to
lecture you, babe.

173
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:31,231
But I guess you're right. Look, you
haven't eaten anything all day.

174
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:34,328
Why don't you go grab
a bite'? I'll be fine.

175
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,332
All right. I'll see
you in an hour, okay?

176
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,577
Not if I see you first.

177
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,913
I was wondering if I could
ask you guys for a favor.

178
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,715
I really need my laptop
and Braille writer

179
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,519
and I can't ask Melissa
to get them for me.

180
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,593
Why not?
Because

181
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,819
I want you to put
this someplace safe.

182
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,667
It's beautiful.

183
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,333
People always say
diamonds are beautiful.

184
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,931
But to me they just feel cold
and have really sharp edges.

185
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,069
I guess convincing her to take
a break was a good thing.

186
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,841
The break was her idea.

187
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,706
Melissa's the only
girl I've ever dated.

188
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,784
She wanted me to be sure
before we took the next step.

189
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,281
Wow.

190
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:26,682
Yeah.

191
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,625
What are you doing?

192
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,792
We're here. We might
as well search the place

193
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,392
in case we're wrong
about periodontitis.

194
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,366
What are you doing?

195
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,909
We're here.
Might as well eat.

196
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,105
You're stealing food
from a blind man?

197
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,911
We're doing him a
favor, he owes me.

198
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,951
Hake it from your
low self-esteem theory,

199
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,921
you have some experience
with relationship breaks.

200
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,060
What happened?

201
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,163
He talked me into it,

202
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,899
then slept with
three of my friends,

203
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,503
then dumped my ass.

204
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,570
College boyfriend.

205
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,505
I thought he was
the love of my life.

206
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,934
Then why agree to a break?

207
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,739
My self-esteem wasn't
as high back then.

208
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,414
No one's is.

209
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,785
Ugh!

210
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,910
Sugar free.

211
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,453
Disgusting.

212
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:38,688
I'll check the bathroom.
You keep checking the snacks.

213
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,147
Greg?

214
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:07,452
Sorry I didn't call first. I just
flew back from my conference.

215
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,350
This really isn't...

216
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,451
I need your medical records,

217
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:14,122
and the name of your
primary physician.

218
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,294
You remember Mr. Bell?

219
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,961
If I didn't, I will now.

220
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:25,901
You're not dying.

221
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,737
I may have misled James

222
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,680
by letting him see
a book on cancer.

223
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:36,252
We did however have some expectations
that you might call first.

224
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:37,677
Yeah.

225
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,693
This isn't how I envisioned
you finding out.

226
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,189
Mr. Bell and I, we're...

227
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,664
Having sex? Got it.

228
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,234
Getting married. Also.

229
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,327
We wanted you to be
the first to know.

230
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,371
I need 10 milligrams
of benzodiazepine.

231
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,345
Help me hold him down.

232
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,186
I'm putting epilepsy
back on the table.

233
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,696
And I'm taking it off because it
doesn't explain losing his teeth.

234
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,859
The kid's diabetic. The periodontitis
could be real but completely unrelated.

235
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,799
A coincidence?
You buying that, House?

236
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,803
Until I hear something
that takes my mind off

237
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,408
the Jurassic schlong that I was
traumatized by this afternoon.

238
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,538
I know what's wrong
with the patient.

239
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,209
Illegal drugs.
Some kind of acid.

240
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,282
His tox screens were clean.

241
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,477
His apartment wasn't.

242
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:43,876
We didn't find any drugs.

243
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,923
Then why am I completely
tripping balls right now?

244
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,729
I am seriously
freaking out here, guys.

245
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,388
Can't you tell?

246
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,166
You pretty much look
the same you always do.

247
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,258
Take your glasses off.

248
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,501
Pupils dilated.

249
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,239
Pulse elevated.

250
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:11,938
Hallucinating?

251
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,312
I think so.

252
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,751
Because he's a rabbit.

253
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:33,301
Oh! I get it.
Because she's his wife.

254
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:37,033
They flirt a lot.
I've seen things.

255
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,812
And Taub.
Taub is either

256
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,620
a tooth fairy or Rainbow Brite.

257
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,459
And you?

258
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,564
You're just House.

259
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:07,332
She ate ice cream and gummy bears
at the patient's apartment.

260
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,235
One of them must have
been dosed with it.

261
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,466
Go back and find the drugs.

262
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,133
You two find out
where he bought them

263
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:16,178
and then MRI his brain check for
infections, masses and plaques.

264
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,813
Am I gonna die?

265
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,315
We'll get back to you on that.

266
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,856
I've been blind since birth.

267
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,655
I thought maybe if I tried
LSD, I might, you know...

268
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,658
Colors, a shape.

269
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,568
I just wanted to see something.

270
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:39,762
How many times?

271
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:40,993
Maybe five or six.

272
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,606
We need to know where you bought it
so we can find out what was in it.

273
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,675
My girlfriend gave it to me.

274
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,038
I'll find her.

275
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,168
No. Don't.

276
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,873
It wasn't Melissa.

277
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,782
I met someone else.

278
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,083
When were you planning
on telling her that?

279
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,180
Before or after you
ask her to marry you?

280
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,785
The ring isn't for her.

281
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,690
We were on a break.

282
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:09,361
She wanted me to see what
else was out there and I did.

283
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,798
I was gonna tell her
the other night,

284
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,564
but I ended up here instead.

285
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,900
We just need to talk to the
one who supplied the drugs.

286
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,565
She's on vacation
with her parents.

287
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,474
This is her cell.

288
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:24,237
I don't want her to know I'm in the
hospital She'll only freak out.

289
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,713
That's very considerate of you.

290
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,209
You think this is easy for me?

291
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,049
I know I have to tell Melissa.

292
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,450
Then what's stopping you?

293
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:33,819
She's still one
of my best friends.

294
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,322
And I don't want
to be alone in here.

295
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:49,665
You seen your mother yet?

296
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,070
She's not dying.

297
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,608
She was having
sex with my father.

298
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,610
Ignore her.
She's on acid.

299
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,081
Your father's dead, House.

300
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:04,120
Not the dead dad,
the biological dad.

301
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,746
The one I pointed out to you
at the fake father's funeral.

302
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,017
Hun!

303
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,584
Are you sure?

304
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:15,761
Your only evidence is that birthmark
you saw when you were 12.

305
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,258
Well, now I've seen two.

306
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:24,499
The good news is, I won't technically
be a bastard much longer.

307
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:27,203
We're gonna be one
big crappy family.

308
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,972
Well, that's great news.

309
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:36,280
Your mother won't be alone anymore and
you can finally get to know the guy.

310
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,947
Yes.
That is one option.

311
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,622
Are you saying you're
not even curious?

312
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:43,952
You want to know what I think?

313
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,989
I think you know the
answer to that question.

314
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,153
You avoid your mother

315
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:50,130
because she's the one person whose
opinion you actually care about.

316
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,701
If that was true, you'd have
every reason to shut up.

317
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,635
I avoid my mother
because she's boring.

318
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:57,537
That's why you've been so
open and honest about prison

319
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,234
and marrying
a complete stranger.

320
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,571
Even if I care what she thinks,

321
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,078
why would I care what
some sperm donor does?

322
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,342
You read the guy's book
about three times.

323
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:09,681
Years ago and it took three times
because it was so badly written.

324
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,086
<i>Om I get it.</i>

325
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,149
The second birthmark
was on his penis, right?

326
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,524
The kid's a dick.

327
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:21,857
You've been working
for House for months

328
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:25,365
and just now realized that disabled
people can also be dicks'?

329
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,865
What he's doing now
to that girl isn't fair.

330
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,597
The break was her idea.

331
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,776
And now she thinks
they're back together.

332
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,939
He's a scared, sick blind kid
who doesn't want to be alone.

333
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,540
You really don't get that?

334
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,283
I do. But...

335
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,177
What is it?

336
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,881
Not good news for him.
Or Park.

337
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,627
Where's Park?

338
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,400
Wilson's babysitting her.

339
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:06,305
Talking about the fact that she
could have permanent brain damage

340
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,309
might bum her trip
out a little bit.

341
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:11,242
Dark spot doesn't necessarily
equal brain damage.

342
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:16,080
It could be a congenital malformation
connected with his blindness or a tumor.

343
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,380
A clot.

344
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:20,423
Exactly. We need to do another
scan, then inject dye...

345
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:21,889
I said a clot,

346
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,386
not or a clot.

347
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,623
It's a clot. Cerebral
venous sinus thrombosis.

348
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:29,756
That'd be good news for Park,

349
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,664
but I've never seen one
present this large before.

350
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,395
It fits.
When it was smaller,

351
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,063
it caused his initial
disorientation and hallucinations.

352
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,005
As it grew larger,
the seizures.

353
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:41,135
If left untreated, it leads
to cerebral edema and death,

354
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,906
but what causes
that and tooth loss?

355
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:46,515
Any hyper-coagulable state.
Lupus?

356
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:51,520
I counter your lupus
with Behcet's syndrome.

357
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,647
No. He doesn't have any
of the earlier symptoms,

358
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:56,920
color blindness, abnormal
visual fields or...

359
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:04,033
We've been ignoring his
eyes because he's blind.

360
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:08,872
If he wasn't before,
he would be by now.

361
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,668
Confirm with an eye exam and start
treatment with heparin for the clot.

362
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,871
Interferon and steroids
for the Behcet's.

363
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,146
Give me back my teeth!

364
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,978
Park, listen. Park!

365
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,278
You're a tooth thief!

366
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:24,281
No, no, no, stop it!
Stop it!

367
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:27,857
Back on the couch!

368
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,449
What are you doing
to this poor girl?

369
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:30,650
It's not what it
looks like. She's...

370
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:36,122
She's tripping on acid.

371
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:40,466
Good Lord, man. That's no
way to treat a bad trip.

372
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,630
Put the chair down. You'll end
up hurting the poor wee thing.

373
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,675
Hello, darling.

374
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:51,137
I'm Thomas and this beautiful
creature here is Blythe.

375
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:53,080
Is there anything
we can do to help you?

376
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:55,652
That rabbit stole my teeth.

377
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:57,981
Of course, he did. But I'll
tell you what he's done.

378
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:01,251
He's put them back again and they're
twice as nice as they used to be.

379
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:02,826
You can feel them if you like.

380
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:08,758
See?

381
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,265
Now why don't we sit on
this nice, comfy couch,

382
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:15,362
have a nice cool drink and talk all about it?
Would you like that?

383
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:23,677
He's had some experience with
things like this back in the day.

384
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,943
As I recall, both of us'

385
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,541
Ah! Not the time
or the place, dear.

386
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,621
See? There you go.

387
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,895
There's no way that
guy's related to you.

388
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:50,465
There's fresh scarring and swelling in
both fundi and a bleed on the left.

389
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:51,700
House was right.

390
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,237
It's Behcet's syndrome.

391
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:56,139
Give it to me straight, Doc.

392
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:57,578
Am I ever gonna see again?

393
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:01,746
That's a little out
of our jurisdiction.

394
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,410
We need to wrap a dressing over
your eyes to keep the light out.

395
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,214
Not really a problem for me.

396
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,756
You might not see it
but your tissue does.

397
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,883
It'll also help
with the swelling.

398
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,055
I'll leave you in
Dr. Adams' capable hands.

399
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,930
You think I'm an ass,
don't you?

400
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:27,836
I can tell by your breathing.

401
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,277
Either you're angry or fat.

402
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:34,106
I think it's unfair that
you're leading on a woman

403
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,617
who obviously loves
and cares about you.

404
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:38,483
I love and care about her, too,

405
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,951
but we just don't work
together as a couple.

406
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,453
You need to tell her that.

407
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,926
I'm going to,

408
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,596
but I just want to
do it the right way.

409
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,432
I don't want her to hate me.

410
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,196
When she finds out you bought an
engagement ring for another woman,

411
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:57,103
that option is out the window.

412
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,607
It was going to be for her.

413
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,833
What changed?

414
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,946
She told me we were
going on a break.

415
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,270
I didn't even get
a say in the matter.

416
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,783
She wanted you to be sure
about your relationship.

417
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,616
I can see how that
would be annoying.

418
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,983
I think I liked it better when
you were just breathing angrily.

419
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:23,296
She still sees me as the same sheltered
blind geek she met in college.

420
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,462
Most of the time she acts more
like my mother than my girlfriend.

421
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:32,373
I asked her to marry me. She tells me
I need to date somebody else first?

422
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:34,209
I'd rather she just dumped me.

423
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,304
At least that I can understand.

424
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:40,678
So you were hurt so much you had
to marry the next woman you met?

425
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,876
Julie doesn't see me as I was,

426
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:45,349
but for who I am now.

427
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:49,323
She trusts me to make my own
decisions and to help her with hers.

428
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,154
For the first time in my life,

429
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:56,660
I have somebody who needs me
instead of the other way around.

430
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:10,071
She finally fell asleep. I think
she'll be fine in a couple of hours.

431
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,884
How do you know about
handling a bad acid trip?

432
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,680
Friends in your gardening club
been experimenting again?

433
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,851
I was young once.

434
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:28,062
A little scrapbook that
Thomas threw together.

435
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:31,430
He even has a couple of
pictures of you as a child.

436
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,533
I've known Greg
almost since he was born.

437
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,368
His father and I
were like brothers.

438
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,769
I was a Navy chaplain
in those days.

439
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:41,041
I left the service
in the late '60s.

440
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,638
I don't think his dad ever forgave
me for protesting the war.

441
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:47,046
Of course, if he knew
I got Blythe involved...

442
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:48,879
You protested
the war? When?

443
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:52,215
You were a child. I didn't share
my entire schedule with you.

444
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,449
We knew if we told you, you'd
tell him and he'd kill us both.

445
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,891
He was a Marine. That was
the ultimate betrayal.

446
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,728
Penultimate.

447
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,955
Sweetheart, I think we need
to get back to the hotel.

448
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,728
Wilson, it's been
a real pleasure.

449
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:11,900
You're right.

450
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,641
Much too formal.

451
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,007
Come here, lad.

452
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,742
We're practically family now.

453
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:23,646
We'll see you boys tonight.

454
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,250
8:00 sharp.
Good.

455
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:30,523
I invited them out to dinner.

456
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,690
Told them it was your idea.

457
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,626
Straw.

458
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,705
I know we agreed that whatever
happened on break would stay on break

459
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,177
and I don't expect you
to talk about yours.

460
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:53,845
I just want you to know
that there was no one else.

461
00:27:56,842 --> 00:28:00,483
I missed you so much I barely
even saw my own friends.

462
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:04,651
I'm just so glad it's finally over.

463
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,185
Are you okay?

464
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,734
What's happening to him?

465
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,344
Is he gonna be okay?

466
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:31,147
I'm gonna need to discuss
that with my colleagues.

467
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:35,052
We have to talk.
No,

468
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:36,817
you need to rest.

469
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:38,723
I have to tell you

470
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:40,488
about what happened
on the break.

471
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,724
Later, you just
lie back and relax.

472
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,891
Stop it, Melissa.

473
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,727
Just stop telling me
what I need

474
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,832
and listen for once, okay?

475
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:00,341
How are you feeling?

476
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,782
Embarrassed.

477
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:06,015
I'm still not sure what was
real or what I hallucinated.

478
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,357
<i>Did you try to kiss me?</i>

479
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:11,417
What about you?

480
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:14,923
He's stabilized for the moment.

481
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,600
Coughing up blood? That
doesn't really change anything.

482
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,532
Hemoptysis is a
symptom of Behcet's.

483
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,798
Except our treatment should
make him better not worse.

484
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,463
It could be doing both.

485
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,766
Our treatment breaks down his clot
in his head like it's supposed to,

486
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:30,745
except a piece broke off and traveled
to one of his arteries in his lungs.

487
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,782
If anything, we need
to increase the heparin

488
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,147
to prevent further
clots from forming.

489
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,480
We do that and he
starts hemorrhaging,

490
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:37,986
we won't be able
to stop the bleeding.

491
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:42,286
We don't do that, the next clot
causes a heart attack or a stroke.

492
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,553
Park's way, he at least
has a shot at living.

493
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,962
CT his lungs to confirm
and up the dose.

494
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,138
She's young and hot.

495
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:56,763
She'll bounce back.

496
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,637
82 pounds.

497
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:04,741
How much weight I put on when
my break ended the same way.

498
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:09,478
People were calling
me Park-ing-lot.

499
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:13,948
<i>Mmm.</i>

500
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:18,151
Almost 9:00. I think your
boy's gonna stand us up.

501
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,593
No, no.
He'll be here.

502
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:23,255
He practically
walked in on us having sex.

503
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:27,365
God, if I saw my mother doing
that, I'd claw my own eyes out.

504
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:31,930
Of course, she was nowhere
near as attractive as you.

505
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,500
Horribly fat,
as a matter of fact.

506
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,204
Mother.

507
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,777
Guy sleeping with my mother.

508
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,777
This is Dominika.
My wife.

509
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,345
It's so nice to be meeting you.

510
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:49,620
Gregory tells me that you were
born in Richmond, Virginia,

511
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:53,185
and your father was a tailor
who stole from his clients.

512
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:59,161
James has persuaded me of the value of
openness and honesty in relationships.

513
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:07,342
We see people with
disabilities all the lime.

514
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:11,711
But seeing and understanding
aren't always the same thing.

515
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,851
Are you talking to me or
writing a Facebook post?

516
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,722
I'm saying we should have picked up on
the degeneration in his eyes sooner.

517
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,385
We ignored them because we assumed they
weren't even part of the equation.

518
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:29,529
I also realized,
intellectually,

519
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:33,500
I may understand what it means
to be disabled, but emotionally?

520
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,593
I didn't have a clue.

521
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:37,670
Apparently, his
girlfriend didn't either.

522
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,208
So you're back on his side?

523
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:41,504
It's not a side,
it's a perspective.

524
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,275
He just wants to be treated like an adult.
Make his own decisions.

525
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:48,544
I may not agree
with all of them,

526
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:51,110
but how the hell
can I judge him?

527
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,118
I'm sure that's exactly
what disabled people want.

528
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,123
To be treated like
completely foreign entities,

529
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:59,593
incapable of being
judged and understood.

530
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:04,758
Park was rig ht about the clot.

531
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,238
Hopefully, the anticoagulants
keep it from killing him.

532
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:13,039
So, she gets the couch
on the odd nights,

533
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,771
and I get the bed on evens.

534
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:17,210
In exchange for
a federal felony,

535
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,409
she gets a green card
and I get a live-in maid.

536
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:23,782
Good for you.

537
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,950
The immigration policy in
this country is a travesty.

538
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,787
It forces people to lie just
so nice people can stay here.

539
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,225
Thank you.

540
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:33,991
Dad.

541
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,993
I'm grateful you approve.

542
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:44,607
You should also know that I
was not in Africa last year.

543
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:45,733
You were in jail.

544
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,640
I've been reading the Princeton Police
blotter ever since you moved here.

545
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:57,620
And I'm afraid I haven't been
truthful with you either.

546
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,922
And I've wanted to tell you
this for a very long time.

547
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:06,952
Thomas and I.4.

548
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,663
We got married two months after
your father passed away.

549
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:12,757
Uh-huh.

550
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,701
You understand, we
didn't want you to think

551
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:17,296
we were disrespecting
the memory of your father.

552
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:24,705
And is there another secret
that you want to share with me?

553
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:33,955
There's nothing you think
might be relevant to my life?

554
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,114
Like what?

555
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,361
I don't know. Just off
the top of my head,

556
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,192
something like
I DNA-tested my dad

557
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,366
and found that he was not
my biological father.

558
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:45,066
You are.

559
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,636
That's impossible.

560
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:48,827
People lie.

561
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,462
Birthmarks don't.

562
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,840
Oh, my God!

563
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,750
You told me he was a preemie.

564
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:05,420
This bloody lunatic is my son?

565
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:06,988
He's not a lunatic.

566
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,218
All those years, you could've
told me, I could've done things.

567
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:11,726
I could've made a difference
in the boy's life.

568
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,485
I think we should all
just calm down and...

569
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:16,997
Look at him sitting there!
A pill-popping sociopath.

570
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,726
If you wanted to
screw up his life,

571
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,393
you couldn't
have done it better.

572
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:21,562
He's got you there, Mom.

573
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,764
He's one of the most well-respected
doctors in the world.

574
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,843
He's saved more lives
than you can count.

575
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,835
Now you apologize to him,

576
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:34,179
or I swear you will never
see me again, Thomas.

577
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,515
I can't deal with this anymore.

578
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,248
<i>He.s m
Y son, '</i>

579
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:41,586
I'm gonna have a bloody breath of fresh air.
That's what I'm doing.

580
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,600
So, who's for dessert?

581
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:58,704
Somebody help me!

582
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:04,540
Will, it's Dr. Adams and Dr. Chase.
We just need to know where...

583
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:05,980
My eyes! My eyes!

584
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,208
Feels like ifs on fire!

585
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,326
It's not Behcet's. It doesn't
necrotize tissue like this.

586
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,456
I think it's
streptococcus pyogenes.

587
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,797
Except we've already treated him
with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

588
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,065
It shouldn't be spreading,
it should be dying.

589
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,233
It just means
it's drug resistant.

590
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,311
We need to remove what's left of
his eyes before gangrene sets in.

591
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,075
It's something that looks and acts
like a bacteria, but isn't one.

592
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,911
Could be viral.
No, it couldn't.

593
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,351
No evidence of viral markers
in the necrotized tissue.

594
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:49,422
Let me see that image you took last
night of the clot in his lung.

595
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:02,005
That's not a piece of
the clot from his brain.

596
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,698
That's the point of infection.

597
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:08,011
Mucormycosis.

598
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,778
He breathed in the spores.

599
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,936
Must be growing and
spreading ever since.

600
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:13,778
A fungal infection
spreading this fast?

601
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,512
Kid's a diabetic. He already has
a compromised immune system.

602
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:19,612
He's right. This sample from
his eyes is crawling with it.

603
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,055
Treat him with amphotericin B.

604
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:25,623
We treated him with gentamicin
when we thought it was bacterial.

605
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:28,628
Which means the dose of amphotericin
B we'll need to cure him

606
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,867
will probably leave him deaf.

607
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:35,801
Sorry, stopped listening after you said,
"The dose we'll need to cure him."

608
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,748
Blind and deaf?

609
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,151
I'd rather be dead.

610
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:53,885
You will be.

611
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,925
I can live with that.

612
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:05,097
You never did get my humor.

613
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,003
There's a chance your hearing
won't be completely gone.

614
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,505
How much of a chance?

615
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,910
A small one, but a chance.

616
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,017
I'm refusing treatment

617
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:39,191
You don't know how hard
things are already for me.

618
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,965
I can't handle any more.

619
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,544
I can't.

620
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,943
Oh! Hi.

621
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,155
I'm hereto apologize.

622
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:05,388
I could have handled
the news with more aplomb.

623
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,459
I have a son.

624
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,065
That's great news!

625
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:14,661
What else did she
tell you to say?

626
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,830
You're not a lunatic,
you're not a mistake.

627
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,407
I never liked your
friend, my father.

628
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:28,911
He could be a bit
intense at times.

629
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:30,074
But unlike you,

630
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,416
I did respect him.

631
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:36,915
Do you respect your mother?

632
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:44,423
Well, we do have that in common.
And we all love her.

633
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,601
So we don't have
much choice, do we?

634
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,937
Son, see you at dinner.

635
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,120
Will, it's me.

636
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,968
Let me guess.

637
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:23,401
The doctor who thinks I'm an ass
wants you to convince me to live?

638
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:25,801
Yes.

639
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:32,572
It won't work.

640
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:34,808
I know.

641
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:37,843
So I won't.

642
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,992
Wow. You're that angry.

643
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:47,657
I've made enough
decisions for you.

644
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,496
This is your life.

645
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,665
Why did you come back?

646
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,499
Because I love you.

647
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,676
And I want to be with you
for as long as I can.

648
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,217
Melissa, I'm so scared.

649
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:16,856
Me, too.

650
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:24,627
I'll always love you.

651
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,370
Even if I was deaf?

652
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:33,698
Even if anything.

653
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:54,653
Is it working?

654
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,290
He's still very ill,

655
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:00,767
but if he keeps responding the way
he has been, he should be fine.

656
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:04,734
And his hearing?

657
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:06,335
It's gone.

658
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:09,344
We don't know yet
if it'll be permanent.

659
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,112
Melissa, is that you?

660
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:23,954
We've been squeezing his hand
once for yes, twice for no.

661
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:31,800
Can I ask you something?

662
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,095
I'll completely understand
if you squeeze no.

663
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:44,940
Will you marry me?

664
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,620
Don't leave me hanging now.

665
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:57,953
Yes.

666
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,996
Yes! Of course, yes!

667
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:02,888
I heard that

668
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,564
You said yes, right?

669
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,135
You said yes.

670
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,474
How long are you gonna
wait until you tell me'?

671
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:22,641
I thought we already
had the Santa Claus talk.

672
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:27,149
You don't think I saw you steal
Thomas' fork from the restaurant?

673
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:28,223
Why would I do that?

674
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:29,757
For his DNA.

675
00:42:30,815 --> 00:42:33,762
That's...

676
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:37,497
Very observant of you.

677
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:39,659
See, you are more me
than you pretend.

678
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:43,529
You had to know for sure.
So you needed proof.

679
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:49,171
And the fact that you haven't
told me can only mean...

680
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:53,508
He isn't your father either.

681
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:02,718
I'm sorry.

682
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:07,692
You know what that means?

683
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:09,559
Your mom's a slut?

684
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,126
That.

685
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:17,865
And she's not as boring
as I thought she was.
