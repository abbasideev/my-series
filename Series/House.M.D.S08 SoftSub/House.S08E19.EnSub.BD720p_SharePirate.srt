1
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,453
Three, two, one!

2
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:12,713
Ah!

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,819
Whoo!

4
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:19,791
What do you want to do next?

5
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,054
Uh...

6
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,223
Swings?

7
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:26,470
Okay. Crawl tube?

8
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,195
Nah.
Nah?

9
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:32,475
Well, I think we're running
out of options, honey.

10
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,546
I want to go on the
merry-go-round.

11
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,308
The... Again?

12
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,910
But this time all by myself.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,878
Oh...

14
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,721
I don't know, jelly bean.

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,814
Daddy, I'm six.
I'm not a baby anymore.

16
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,222
Please?

17
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,164
Thank you.

18
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,000
You ready?
Uh-huh.

19
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,401
All right. Come here.

20
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,765
I'll take Beary.

21
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,736
Now, you promise you're not
going to tell Mommy, right?

22
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,245
She'll kick my butt
if she finds out.

23
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:10,838
Pinky swear.

24
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,116
All right.
Go get 'em.

25
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:21,792
- Remember to hold on tight.
- I will!

26
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,081
Stop the ride!

27
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,255
Emily!

28
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,163
Emily! Where are you!

29
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,598
Em?

30
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,102
Emily?

31
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,104
Emily?

32
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:48,773
Emily' where are you, honey?

33
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,014
Emily? Emily?

34
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,782
Honey?

35
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,124
Help me!

36
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,089
Is that our precious
little bundle of tumor?

37
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,363
They grow up
so fast, don't they?

38
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,734
How do you think? How did
you know I was here?

39
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,098
Foreman.

40
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,075
Actually, that would have been
easier. No, I followed you.

41
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,909
It didn't occur to you
that that might mean

42
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,005
I don't want you involved
in my cancer treatment.

43
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,414
I'm not here as a doctor.

44
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,509
I'm here as a towering
pillar of strength.

45
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,178
Be a pillar in the parking lot.

46
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,345
No.

47
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,017
How many times have I told
you I wanted to be alone

48
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,095
and you've made yourself
a pain in the ass?

49
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,253
I owe you.

50
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,463
My word, not a word.

51
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,534
Realizing I'm most likely going
to regret this, all right.

52
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,554
What are you doing?

53
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,992
My best friend has cancer.
Cut me some slack.

54
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,789
Also, it's spring break.

55
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,262
I'm on vacation.

56
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,794
Although looking at
you now, I can tell

57
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:53,167
that the wet t-shirt contest
is probably going to suck.

58
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,840
House taking time off
is a bad sign.

59
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,738
"A bad sign."

60
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,676
You think the apocalypse is coming because
House wants to be there for Wilson?

61
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:07,808
Yes.

62
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,818
You're new.

63
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,120
We've got a case.

64
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,653
Six-year-old with
a nose bleed

65
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:21,096
and breathing problems. She was
born with a rare mutation of A-T.

66
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:24,929
Emily has a unique variant
on both of her ATM genes.

67
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,767
Her disorder mimics A-T,
but not all of the symptoms.

68
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,598
This is Dr. Elizabeth
Lawson.

69
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,533
She's a developmental
geneticist attached to JHU

70
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,168
and an expert on the
girl's condition.

71
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,442
Elizabeth Lawson.

72
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:38,605
Emily Lawson.

73
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,109
I'm here as a doctor,
not a mother.

74
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,628
Nose bleeds and breathing
problems are common symptoms

75
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,561
of ataxia telangiectasia.

76
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,063
We could just be seeing
the natural progression of...

77
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:57,158
It's not. A-T patients have a
life expectancy of 20 years.

78
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,292
Emily is only six.
It's something else.

79
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:03,836
I examined her lungs two days ago.
They're functioning normally.

80
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,841
It says she fell off a carousel.
Head trauma could...

81
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,970
If the diagnosis was easy,
I wouldn't need you people.

82
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,976
I'm here because according
to Eric, you're the best.

83
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,042
We are.

84
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,017
Have you considered
Wegener's granulomatosis?

85
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,520
It's a good fit.

86
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,156
But she can't have x-rays.

87
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,697
A-T makes her hypersensitive
to ionizing radiation.

88
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,199
I'll get her prepped
for an MRI.

89
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:39,034
She knows more about her daughter's
genetic condition than any of you.

90
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,576
She'll be an asset.

91
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,741
Or she won't, Eric.

92
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,184
This isn't a request.
Use her.

93
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,681
The tumor's spread
to the surrounding tissue.

94
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,456
We're gonna have to shrink it
before we remove it surgically.

95
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,623
I'm more interested in exactly
how you plan to do that, Mike.

96
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,257
We start conservative.

97
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,302
Daily radiation treatments
for three weeks.

98
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:08,236
And if it doesn't shrink enough
after that, we'll add the chemo...

99
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,706
And if it hasn't shrunk
enough after that, I'm dead.

100
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:20,582
Look, you have over a 75% chance that
the radiation alone is enough. Relax.

101
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,208
We've caught this in time.

102
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,950
Catching it in time would have been before
it invaded the tissue around my thymus.

103
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,287
I want the radiation
and the chemo concurrently.

104
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,388
Why stress your immune
system unnecessarily?

105
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,759
Let's just go with
my plan. Okay?

106
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,457
The radiation first and... I'm
gonna get a second opinion.

107
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,227
Are you serious?

108
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,169
Look, I've seen you recommend this
exact treatment dozens of times.

109
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,603
We're done here.

110
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,571
I'll look for a doctor with
some actual balls.

111
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,578
Hey, you need to
talk to your friend.

112
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:51,943
He's embarrassing himself.

113
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,109
A doctor should be able
to handle his own illness

114
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,516
with a little bit more dignity.
I agree with Wilson.

115
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,247
My recommended
treatment is sound.

116
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,188
No, I meant about
the ball-less part.

117
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,953
Explains the office.

118
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,464
It was a
merry-go-round.

119
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,463
She's a kid, Liz.
We were having fun.

120
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,124
You should try it sometime.
Fun?

121
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,930
She's six, not you. You know
she has balance issues.

122
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,768
I know that she's...

123
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:19,266
This is Emily's father, Simon.

124
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,877
He was with her
when the symptoms occurred.

125
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,141
I had her all week.
She was fine.

126
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:28,283
- We could come back.
- No need. Patient's ready for transport.

127
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,319
Wake up, sleepy head.

128
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,955
I saw it in the gift shop. I
know how much you like them.

129
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,495
Thanks.

130
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,627
They're going to take
you for an MRI now.

131
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:51,506
It means "magic really
cool images."

132
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:55,674
I thought it stood for
magnetic resonance imaging.

133
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,305
We've spent a lot
of time in hospitals.

134
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,379
B-9.

135
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,855
Hit. And I hate you.

136
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,355
I'm done.

137
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,032
I sunk your battleship?
No.

138
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,833
But I think I'm going to puke.

139
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,238
Good. Now that you're
sufficiently buzzed,

140
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,507
what was the reason behind
you freaking out on Kondo?

141
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,774
You scared? In denial?

142
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:33,613
I know you get confused any time
someone thinks that you're wrong.

143
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:37,017
But it's not considered freaking out for
a patient to ask for a second opinion.

144
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,357
Okay, well, here it is.
Kondo was right.

145
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,892
You should be in
radiology right now.

146
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:45,356
Well done. You've kept your
word for almost two hours.

147
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:49,867
Every day you wait, our pal, Tumie,
is growing larger in your chest.

148
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,100
You want to live, stop screwing
around and do something about ii.

149
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,972
Good idea.

150
00:09:56,062 --> 00:10:00,943
I think I'll start with spending
spring break on my own.

151
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,376
How are you feeling
in there, Emily?

152
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,614
<i>Good, I guess.</i>

153
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,247
Something wrong?

154
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,883
<i>I was only pretending
to be asleep.</i>

155
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,553
<i>You think that's dishonest?</i>

156
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,794
That's...

157
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,233
My daughters do that, too,

158
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,670
but they know that sometimes when it
seems like mommy and daddy are fighting,

159
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,742
it's really only because
they're worried about you.

160
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,408
<i>And does your wife
ever want a divorce?</i>

161
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,481
No. Everything's
fine at home.

162
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,452
Hold still now.
No more talking.

163
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,858
What do you think
of her mother?

164
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,161
She called her
daughter "the patient."

165
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,924
If my kids were born
with an expiration date,

166
00:10:58,858 --> 00:10:59,836
I don't...

167
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,201
Where does it hurt?

168
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,111
I want my daddy!
Where's my daddy?

169
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,225
We were able to restore
circulation to her hands and feet

170
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,125
before any permanent
damage set in.

171
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,687
Primary Raynaud's?

172
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,392
The cold inside the MRI room
could have set it off.

173
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,469
Stress can also precipitate
the condition.

174
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,336
She's shown no evidence of cold sensitivity
and she has no problems with MRI machines.

175
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,705
There are other
kinds of stress.

176
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,973
She heard you and
your husband fighting.

177
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:45,412
Unfortunately, she's heard a lot worse
than that before. It's not stress.

178
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,678
Could be secondary Raynaud's.

179
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,219
Lupus is consistent with
Emily's symptoms.

180
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:50,515
Her lymph nodes aren't enlarged

181
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:54,320
and she has shown
no signs of immune activation.

182
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,388
It could be heavy
metal poisoning.

183
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,760
From what? The carousel?

184
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,195
She was only on
it for a minute.

185
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,430
Simon moved into an old apartment
building three weeks ago.

186
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,604
I'm sure he has no idea
what the insulation's made of,

187
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,505
what kind of paint.

188
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,678
He's a good father, but when
it comes to Emily's health...

189
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,515
I'm gonna get his keys
and check for environmentals.

190
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,606
Lupus is a better fit.

191
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:23,415
I don't mean to pull rank
here, but I am her mother.

192
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,887
I thought you said you
were here as a doctor.

193
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,921
And as a doctor, I need
parental consent. See above.

194
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,685
While I'm gone, please start
her on chelation therapy.

195
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,027
She's the mother.

196
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,630
So let's treat her like
any other mother.

197
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,739
I think we just hit the
environmental mother lode.

198
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,612
Funny she never mentioned
an entire basement

199
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,380
full of dangerous
chemicals and drugs.

200
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:00,087
You think she'd even let
Emily down here?

201
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,584
Yeah.

202
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,490
And apparently a lot.

203
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,771
You ever heard of LEX-2?

204
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,167
I've read about it.

205
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,809
It's an experimental
aminoglycoside antibiotic.

206
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:28,408
Supposedly it can override
DNA errors in the ATM gene.

207
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,150
Doesn't mean she's giving
it to her daughter.

208
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,920
Anyone studying A-T
would be researching it.

209
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,420
How?

210
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,527
You see any lab rats down here?

211
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,033
The only cage I see
is right there.

212
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,673
Go away.
I have a headache.

213
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,611
We don't have to have sex.

214
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,888
Sometimes it's nice just
to cuddle and talk.

215
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:07,954
Me first.

216
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,057
You don't want
a second opinion.

217
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,187
You're already on your fifth.

218
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,664
You have Evans at Mercy,
Shaw at County,

219
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,360
Foster at Johns Hopkins.

220
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,734
Every one of them
has given you the same advice.

221
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,204
You're nuts.

222
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,966
You don't just want chemo.

223
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,235
You want a dose so high

224
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,871
there's a one-in-three chance
it will kill you outright.

225
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,008
The question is,

226
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,488
why didn't you tell me?

227
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,052
Because you knew I'd stop you.

228
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:45,193
Which means you've already
found someone insane enough

229
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,396
or desperate enough

230
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:50,331
to give you what amounts to
a death dose of chemicals.

231
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,564
But who would be that stupid?

232
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:58,532
I'm thinking that
the "who" is you.

233
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:21,062
Where exactly were you
planning on killing yourself?

234
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:25,262
'Cause I don't think Foreman is
going to let you do it here.

235
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,300
My place. I've been
stockpiling equipment.

236
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,967
No. No! Stop.

237
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,385
I'm still healthy,

238
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:47,152
why not go the extreme route now when
there's a better chance of surviving it'?

239
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,725
Statistically,

240
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,389
this treatment has about the same chance
of killing you as the thymoma does.

241
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,225
But a hell of a lot faster.

242
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:09,343
Nancy Wells. Cervical
cancer, 70% survival rate.

243
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,811
Died November 6, 1998.
64 years old.

244
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,684
Bernie Jones, melanoma,
89% survival rate.

245
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,818
October 10, 1999.
He was 52.

246
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,935
John Taylor. Thyroid,

247
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,528
96% survival rate.

248
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,035
I promised him he'd be fine.

249
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,104
Eight years old.

250
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:50,045
I am not going to die slowly in a
hospital bed under fluorescent lighting

251
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:53,487
with people stopping by to
gawk and lie about how I look.

252
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:57,551
Even a small chance of that happening
is too big a chance for me.

253
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,562
You're an idiot.

254
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,467
And the odds say
you're going to die.

255
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,139
We'll do it at my place.

256
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:35,488
The only environmental factors we
think caused your daughter's illness

257
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,727
are the ones you
shot her full of.

258
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:37,857
I tested the drug.

259
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:40,234
This is what I did for
a living for 10 years.

260
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,772
She's your child, not
a guinea pig.

261
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,668
I tested it first.

262
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,707
On myself.

263
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,905
And in six months I didn't
document any adverse effects.

264
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,748
A trial of one is
basically irrelevant.

265
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,184
Respiratory infections are
common with A-T.

266
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,956
With Emily's mutation, they are
deadly and they get worse every year.

267
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:09,693
LEX-2 won't be approved for
at least the next five years.

268
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,463
Emily, on the other hand, wouldn't
have survived the winter.

269
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,533
What was I supposed to do?

270
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:25,542
There's a reason for FDA requirements.
A study at Jackson Memorial...

271
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,279
I know about Gaines' research.
He's publishing next month.

272
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,717
Was. I just spoke
to him.

273
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:34,257
His team just linked the use of LEX-2
to renal failure in mice and rats.

274
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:44,757
She needs an ultrasound-guided
renal biopsy to check the damage.

275
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:45,962
Hopefully, ifs reversible.

276
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,936
To stupidity.

277
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,931
Not quite done.

278
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:28,035
To muscle aches, spasms.

279
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,205
To your joints feeling
like they've been ripped out

280
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,145
and replaced with shards
of broken glass.

281
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,116
Should I be writing
any of this clown?

282
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,847
Your stomach fills with bile.

283
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,012
When you vomit it feels like

284
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,990
someones forcing a white hot hammer down
your esophagus, tearing your flesh.

285
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,187
Blood's dripping down
the back of your throat,

286
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:47,821
choking and gagging you with the
slick, coppery taste of burnt pennies.

287
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,500
I am an oncologist, I know...

288
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,366
If you did, we wouldn't
be sitting here.

289
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:54,866
Day two.

290
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,501
Your white blood cells are gone,
opening up your system to attack.

291
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,066
Your temperature skyrockets.

292
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:04,308
One second, your skin feels like it's on
fire, the next second, it's entombed in ice.

293
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,180
Every pain sensor in your body
is firing at the same time

294
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,347
until agony isn't even
a word or a concept.

295
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,082
It's your only reality.

296
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,918
You hallucinate.

297
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,754
You dream of death.

298
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,151
And then the race begins.

299
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,728
Can your body claw its
way back in time

300
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:25,894
before the hostile organisms and
parasites claim you permanently?

301
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:28,900
Win, you live.
Lose, you die.

302
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,847
Now, what are we
doing here, Wilson?

303
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,763
Kidney number one looks good,

304
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,770
which means we'll probably
take the biopsy from two.

305
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,642
Hey. You're doing great.

306
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,035
Brave as always.

307
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,440
Pretty cool, eh?

308
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,050
Wanna try?

309
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,378
What's wrong?

310
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,049
My chest hurts.

311
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,960
Definitely not her kidneys.

312
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:40,237
I promise this'll taste just as good
coming up as it did going down.

313
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,647
If things go wrong, I just
want you to know...

314
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:55,158
If you're going to say that you've
always been secretly gay for me,

315
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,749
everyone always just
kind of assumed it.

316
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,919
I just want you to know

317
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,600
that I appreciate the
risk you're taking.

318
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,828
Pumping a human being full of lethal
chemicals in your living room.

319
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:12,774
If I die, it probably won't go over
well with your probation officer.

320
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,003
That's not going to
be an issue.

321
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,444
I'm glad at least one
of us is confident.

322
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,675
Not me.

323
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:23,950
I've already identified a couple of spots
to dump your body if this goes south.

324
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:27,115
I've always enjoyed
Trinity Park.

325
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,887
It does have a nice
access to the lake.

326
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:35,563
Muscle spasms already? No.
It's nothing really.

327
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:38,463
Good news.

328
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,128
Takes most people two bags
to get to that stage.

329
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:43,400
You're way ahead of schedule.

330
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,245
You'll think it's stupid.

331
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:55,819
That hasn't stopped you before.

332
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:59,552
I just always thought

333
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:04,253
when I got old or sick I'd have a
wife or kids to look after me.

334
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,325
And in this scenario,
are your loving wife and kids

335
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,996
holding the life-support cord

336
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:16,001
or are they thumbing
through your will?

337
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:18,898
I'm in it, right?

338
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,179
You have everything you
need right here.

339
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:26,843
We both do.

340
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:31,777
Painkiller,

341
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,017
industrial strength,

342
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,026
level awesome.

343
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:46,865
We're on vacation.

344
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,601
That is nice.

345
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:03,811
Her kidneys are fine.

346
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,412
I don't think we're looking at
side effects from the LEX-2.

347
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,583
She's prone to respiratory
infection. Pneumonia?

348
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,923
No persistent cough,
chills, or excess sweating.

349
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:12,223
What about a
pulmonary embolism?

350
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,890
Fits coughing up blood,
but a clot? From what?

351
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,627
Bruising from when she
fell off the carousel.

352
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:20,234
Contusion damages a
deep vein, causes a clot.

353
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,930
Piece breaks off,
travels to her lungs.

354
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,065
We need to get her
on heparin now.

355
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:27,304
Another embolism could cause
a heart attack or a stroke.

356
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,339
What's wrong? Is it Emily?

357
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:33,408
Sort of.

358
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,613
You can't do this.

359
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,313
I'm taking her to Mercy.

360
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,151
Everything you people have
done has just made her worse.

361
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,952
You don't have the right.
We have joint custody.

362
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:44,358
Where was my right when you were
treating our daughter like a lab rat?

363
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,485
She'd be dead if I hadn't.

364
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,126
Stop it.

365
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,629
Your daughter deserves
better than this.

366
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,002
It's okay, sweetie.

367
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,975
Mommy and I are just
going to talk. Okay?

368
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:01,477
Wanna get some candy?

369
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,712
We believe Emily has
a clot in her lungs.

370
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:15,117
If you leave now, she could die before
her new doctors are even up to speed.

371
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,618
What, from her A-T?

372
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,958
From the fall off the carousel.

373
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:32,836
Now can we just stop blaming each
other and do the right thing here?

374
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,409
What, you're really going
to equate the two?

375
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:40,041
No. You were giving her two minutes of fun.
I was trying to save her life.

376
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,017
What's her best friend's name?

377
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:45,722
What's the name of
her favorite teacher?

378
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:47,688
Why did she hate that
stuffed animal you gave her?

379
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:52,552
She's been having nightmares
about penguins all month.

380
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,528
What's her blood type?

381
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,941
Rh factor? Her serum
immunoglobulin levels?

382
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,443
I don't care. Those are letters and numbers.
That's not her.

383
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:12,778
What about the variant in her E14
ATM intergenic promoter region?

384
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:16,719
'Cause that's what's
killing our daughter.

385
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,284
Unless I can find a
way to reactivate it.

386
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,695
Just make her better.

387
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,492
You don't look
too good, mister.

388
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:14,666
How did you get in here?

389
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:17,107
The door.

390
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:18,807
Are you, like, sick
or something?

391
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,641
Where's House?

392
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,250
Where are your parents?

393
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:30,182
I know you.

394
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,626
You live in the
building, right?

395
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,091
What's your name?
You don't remember?

396
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:40,863
House.

397
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,618
You promised me I'd go
home again, Dr. Wilson.

398
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,186
You said it wasn't my fault.

399
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,318
<i>It wasn't, John.</i>

400
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:08,229
If I didn't do nothing
wrong, why did I die?

401
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,958
I don't know.

402
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,899
I shouldn't have done this.

403
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,506
Am I dead?

404
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,988
Not yet.
Not yet.

405
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,024
It just feels that way.

406
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:36,582
Are you okay?

407
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:40,061
Apart from the pain, vomiting,
diarrhea and cramps?

408
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:00,445
I worked six months in a
research lab after med school.

409
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,251
You get so focused.

410
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,618
Once I didn't eat for two days.

411
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,449
It's easy to forget
what actually matters.

412
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,550
I didn't.

413
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:15,256
Yeah, it sucks I got her
the wrong doll but...

414
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,198
Good news.

415
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:21,694
Emily's lungs are
clear. No clot.

416
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,366
And bad news. We still don't
know what's happening to her.

417
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:28,104
Whatever it is, there's liver involvement.
Her eyes are jaundiced.

418
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,145
Her liver is failing.

419
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:36,443
We found a blockage
in her hepatic vein

420
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,487
which is restricting blood
flow to her liver.

421
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,056
Polycythemia vera?
Her red blood counts are normal.

422
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:44,253
Could be some sort of
connective tissue disorder.

423
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:45,659
What if...

424
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,658
What if we're just seeing the
end result of her condition?

425
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,602
She's unique.

426
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:59,569
One screwed up gene
from each of us...

427
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:03,775
Let's stick with our process.

428
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,811
I shouldn't be here.

429
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,325
What are we missing?

430
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,122
Advanced Lyme disease?

431
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:21,027
Would have seen it in the blood.
He said "advanced."

432
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,100
We wouldn't pick it up in her blood if
it's in her organs and nervous system now.

433
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,464
It fits everything but
the nose bleed.

434
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:28,869
But why is it attacking
now, all at once?

435
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,496
What's changed?

436
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,766
Elizabeth has.

437
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,608
She stopped giving
Emily the LEX-2.

438
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,510
It's an aminoglycoside
antibiotic.

439
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:40,378
It's what was keeping
the Lyme in check.

440
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:44,010
We need to start her
on amoxicillin.

441
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,807
You lied.

442
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,408
It doesn't taste better
coming back up.

443
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,043
Here's another one.
You look good.

444
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,389
What's the white
blood cell count?

445
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,688
It's down to 1,000.
Still dropping.

446
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:39,165
I need more morphine.
We're out.

447
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:43,409
You've been using my personal
supply of pain killers

448
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:44,708
for the last eight hours.

449
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,440
You have enough for both of us?

450
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,519
I've got enough stashed
around here for a minion.

451
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,464
Just remember they're a gift,

452
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,402
so it's rude to keep
throwing them up.

453
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:12,135
Found that out with those
candlesticks you got me.

454
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:00,412
We think it's Lyme.

455
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,014
I would have seen
signs of that.

456
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,094
Not if the LEX-2 was
keeping it in check.

457
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,923
We live in the city,
we don't have pets.

458
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,364
She's never even
been in the woods.

459
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:11,957
Yes, I have.

460
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:14,462
With Daddy.

461
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:21,808
I should have told you, but I
know how you feel about it.

462
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,346
I grew up hunting with my dad.

463
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:25,938
I wanted to share it with
my daughter at least once.

464
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,610
We only took pictures.
You don't need to be mad.

465
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:31,948
- Maybe we should step outside.
- No.

466
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,982
We can't protect her
from everything.

467
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:43,361
I assume you'll need a
lumbar puncture lo confirm.

468
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,055
You lost a contact?

469
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,323
Going to the little boy's room.

470
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,230
They're called adult
diapers for a reason.

471
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,662
Use it.
I did.

472
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,362
And if you think
I'm gonna let you change me...

473
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,029
It's okay.
I'm a doctor.

474
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,402
Hey, just leave me alone!

475
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,076
It's pathetic.

476
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:39,879
I'm pathetic.

477
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,559
An oncologist with cancer. Of all the
things that could be killing me...

478
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:48,358
It's like the universe is giving
me the big middle finger.

479
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,266
The universe doesn't care.
Why me?

480
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,370
I was always telling my patients
not to torture themselves

481
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,811
because there's no answer.

482
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:05,040
Sound advice.

483
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,548
It's cruel advice.

484
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,211
They were just trying to make sense
of what was happening to them

485
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:12,718
and I'm there telling
them not to bother?

486
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:18,121
I should've spent my life
being more like you.

487
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:22,961
I should've been a manipulative,
self-centered, narcissistic ass

488
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:26,729
who brought misery to everything
and everyone in his life.

489
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,469
You'd still have cancer.

490
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:36,808
Yeah. But at least I'd feel
like I deserved it.

491
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:46,245
Do you think my parents
will get back together?

492
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,760
I don't know.

493
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,430
I'm sure they love
each other but...

494
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,261
They only fight about me.

495
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,597
That's because they
care so much.

496
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:05,473
So, maybe when I die,
they'll get back together.

497
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,812
Emily, what's wrong?
I can't move my arm.

498
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,818
Keep your arms up for me.

499
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,696
What's happening to her?
She's having a stroke.

500
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:40,004
Okay, your heart rate's up, BP's tanking.
White blood count'.-s at 500.

501
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,402
We have to go to the hospital now.
No.

502
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,673
I don't have the equipment
or the meds to handle this.

503
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:47,249
No! Win or lose.

504
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,079
Win or lose.
That was the deal.

505
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:51,814
That was the deal when
there was an "or."

506
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,717
You can't win this.

507
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,481
No. No.

508
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,358
I'd rather die here,

509
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,528
not in an ambulance.

510
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,229
Not in the hospital.
I can't... Please.

511
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:09,529
You can't do that to me.

512
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,207
House,

513
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:20,506
please promise me that
you won't do that to me.

514
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,217
Promise me.

515
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:29,185
Okay, I promise.

516
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:44,036
Stroke, a blockage in
her hepatic vein,

517
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:47,373
coughing blood, trouble
breathing and Raynaud's.

518
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,275
If we hadn't already
ruled it out,

519
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,745
it sounds like textbook
pulmonary embolism.

520
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,908
What mimics a clot, but isn't a clot?
Fungal infection?

521
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,918
Her CSF was clean. No
bacterial or fungal markers.

522
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,146
Anyone tried calling House?

523
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,382
He's not picking up.
Or returning messages or texts.

524
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,949
We're on our own here. So just
give me some theories we can use.

525
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,594
Hematologic malignancies.

526
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:10,325
A-T patients are more prone
to that form of cancer.

527
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:14,062
You think cancer would present
and kill her in three days?

528
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:16,834
Not cancer,

529
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:19,408
but a tumor could
act like a clot.

530
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,772
An atrial myxoma.

531
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,414
<i>A primary heart tumor.</i>

532
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,082
<i>The swinging motion
of the myxoma</i>

533
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,744
<i>intermittently blocked the ﬂow of
blood through the right atrium.</i>

534
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:34,250
<i>Inflow blockage stagnated the hepatic vein,
which clotted and caused liver failure.</i>

535
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,688
<i>Outﬂow blockage caused the
Raynaud's phenomenon and stroke.</i>

536
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:40,194
<i>Pieces of the tumor broke off
and lodged in the lungs,</i>

537
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:43,289
<i>causing Emily's breathing
problems and the coughing blood.</i>

538
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:47,934
We'll remove the tumor surgically and
hopefully the biopsy reveals it's benign.

539
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,375
You really look like crap.

540
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,975
Been fighting a cold lately.

541
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,410
Seven to 10 days for the
swelling to go down,

542
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:40,216
then we rescan and
schedule the surgery.

543
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:59,672
I seem to recall I said
some things to you...

544
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:00,903
You talked a lot.

545
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,045
I stopped listening after you
confessed your fear of dolphins.

546
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:12,184
Can we just tone down the bromance a few notches'?
My leg is killing me.

547
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,213
One last favor?

548
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:20,690
I'd like to actually make it
to the bathroom this time.

549
00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:39,643
I thought you said you
had plenty of Vicodin.

550
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,876
Everybody lies.

551
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,717
So the way I felt, you feel that, what?
Most of the time?

552
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:52,087
It really does suck being you, doesn't it?
At least I don't have cancer.

553
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,398
The tumor was benign.

554
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:10,307
And we were able
to remove all of it.

555
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,938
Does this mean I'm
not sick anymore?

556
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,741
No.

557
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:18,577
Honey,

558
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:22,320
the tumor didn't cause
your genetic condition.

559
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,757
You're still sick.

560
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:28,958
But we never let that
stop us before, right?

561
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,692
So what do you want to do
when we get out of here?

562
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,271
You been to the aquarium?
It's pretty cool.

563
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,137
Can we go, Daddy?
You bet.

564
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:43,677
Me too?
Can she come with us?

565
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,181
You know Mommy
never has to ask.

566
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,826
I'll see you at lunch.
