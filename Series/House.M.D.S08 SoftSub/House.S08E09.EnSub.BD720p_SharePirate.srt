1
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:07,711
We're in the car, honey. We're
going to the hospital for tests.

2
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:19,295
We're in the hospital. We're
going to the doctor's office.

3
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:27,472
Can you tell me
what this is called?

4
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,473
You use it to get
food from inside.

5
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,307
Yes, but what's it called?

6
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,471
Is it a spatula?

7
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,983
No.

8
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,847
Good.
Is it a can opener?

9
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:45,252
No. It's... it's.4.

10
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,691
You're trying to
make me look stupid.

11
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:54,094
You can go to hell! Why don'!
You kill yourself?

12
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,666
Andres.

13
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,927
It's okay.

14
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,933
There she is.

15
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,070
Here I am.

16
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,271
Here. Come on.

17
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,513
You just need to answer
a few more questions,

18
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,520
then we're going home.
We'll have lunch, okay?

19
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,383
Okay.

20
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:23,855
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,864
I have Alzheimer's.

22
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,028
I know.

23
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,135
The mood swings come on quickly,
but it's under control.

24
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:38,539
Don't worry. He's actually
perfect for the drug trial.

25
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,069
On.

26
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,404
Thank God.

27
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,380
We can start as
soon as next week.

28
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,880
Andres! Oh, my God!

29
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,259
And res'?

30
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,322
Early onset familial Alzheimer's.
Brazilian descent.

31
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,922
Blood chemistries
showed high ammonia.

32
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,426
Vomiting stopped after the
ER put him on antiemetics.

33
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,267
Any recent health issues?

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,102
Just a sore throat
a few weeks ago.

35
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,676
How advanced is he?
Could be hyperalimentation.

36
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,768
Advanced enough,
but no IV feedings.

37
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:50,109
The wife shut down her
floral company to stay home

38
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,446
and feed him every meal he's
had in the last four years.

39
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,349
Do we owe this case
to your guilt

40
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,512
at having ignored
your own forgetful mommy?

41
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,681
My guilt over my mom is
why I put up with my dad.

42
00:02:58,779 --> 00:02:59,849
You're taking this case

43
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,187
because we're running a Phase Two
trial on an Alzheimer's drug.

44
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,956
You couldn't round up enough
doddering, old guinea pigs,

45
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,861
so you need us to
fix this little piggy?

46
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:10,196
I'd like to sit in. Especially
since you're short a team member.

47
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,860
You mean Taub?
Got him in here.

48
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,131
He asked for personal days.
His daughter's sick.

49
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,639
Isn't that the point
of having a spare?

50
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,142
I denied his request

51
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,802
After I'd already approved it,

52
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,368
which you knew because
I sent you a memo.

53
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:27,877
Dr. Adams, taped under your
chair is an index card.

54
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,317
Would you read ii, please?

55
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,494
"Wednesday, 2:43 p.m.

56
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:44,559
"A black pawn will believe
he's the black king

57
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:48,663
"and attempt to capture the
white head of diagnostics."

58
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,443
It's 10:15 on Friday.

59
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,911
Damn it. {SIGHS) Look, the
point is, I saw this coming.

60
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,948
Dr. Foreman and I did not
always see eye to eye,

61
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,950
but he never had
the power to overrule me.

62
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,281
Now that he has the power,

63
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,616
he won't be able to resist
the temptation to use it.

64
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,624
With great power
comes great micromanaging.

65
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,022
And great vests.

66
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,688
I know you're
the better diagnostician.

67
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,754
I'm not gonna interfere.
I'm only hereto help.

68
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,562
Could be transient nitrogen
load from a GI bleed.

69
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,068
Not if the vomiting's
persistent.

70
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,572
Which we won't know, because
the ER put him on antiemetics.

71
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:22,606
Take him off.

72
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,073
Wait. He was
puking his guts out.

73
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,042
We'd risk aspiration.

74
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,111
I'm just disagreeing,
not overruling.

75
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,378
So glad you're on board.
Take him off antiemetics.

76
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,387
Do an upper endoscopy
to check for bleeds.

77
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,560
It could be
a bladder infection.

78
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,824
We'll run a pregnancy test.

79
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,159
I'm not pregnant.

80
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,598
Any type of birth control
can fail.

81
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:50,964
Not mine.

82
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,267
Oh, I'm sorry. You said
you were married?

83
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,467
Yeah. Happily...

84
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:03,280
It's okay. Sex can wane
in any marriage over time.

85
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,407
No, no.
We've never had sex.

86
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:10,812
We kiss and cuddle, but neither
one of us is interested in sex.

87
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,259
You're both celibate?

88
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,317
No, neither of us.

89
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,591
Celibacy is a choice.
This is our orientation.

90
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,092
We're asexual.

91
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,829
Not quite sure what box
to check here.

92
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,136
<i>You're making a mistake.</i>

93
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,871
If I had the power to veto him,

94
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,207
given all the crap I've put
up with over the years,

95
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:36,679
I don't know if I could
use it objectively.

96
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,805
I do.

97
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,350
I can. I have.

98
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:43,015
It might be easier if you'd
stay out of the room.

99
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,386
I thought it'd be different.
This week.

100
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,188
I'm supposed to talk to his PO about
getting his ankle monitor off early.

101
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,694
You're saying he
should defer to you?

102
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:54,789
No. I'm just saying what he's
doing doesn't seem rational,

103
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,325
which makes me think it's rational
in a way I'm not privy to.

104
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,166
He always has a plan.

105
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,173
And he's always
self-destructive.

106
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:05,403
He may just be shooting
himself in the ankle.

107
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:16,253
I know it feels strange. Dr. Chase
is just looking in your throat.

108
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,687
We're in the hospital.
You're fine.

109
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,923
That's a pretty nice
trophy there, Andres.

110
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,517
He coached youth soccer.

111
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,187
Took a team that
was zero-and-six

112
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,562
all the way to the state
finals at Long Branch.

113
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,170
Hey, thanks for
doing this in here.

114
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,572
Switching rooms can
be very disorienting.

115
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,007
You take very good care of him.

116
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,341
I love him.
Sickness and health, right?

117
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,747
Upper esophagus is clear,
moving on to the GE junction.

118
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,010
Hi.
Hey.

119
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,023
I'm sorry, family members
only during procedures.

120
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,025
I'll wait outside.

121
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,618
Oh, no, please, it's okay.

122
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:01,255
Joseph helps me
with my husband sometimes.

123
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,559
He's a good friend.

124
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,229
Which means not family.

125
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,271
Wait, we're gonna
be here a while.

126
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,535
Why don't you show Joseph where
the visitor's lounge is'?

127
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,872
Okay.

128
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,608
What?

129
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,549
I'm surprised you didn't go
into the diplomatic corps.

130
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,816
Oh, you think they're...

131
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:27,948
No.
If they're having sex,

132
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,721
it's probably
with their genitals.

133
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:35,557
Mallory-Weiss tear. Vomiting
must have torn the lining.

134
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:42,168
You know that close to 1% of the
population identifies as asexual?

135
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:47,310
We really got to get you laid.

136
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,074
If I have to plow that
furrow myself, so be it.

137
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,412
I've a patient who's asexual.

138
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,679
Is she a giant pool of algae?

139
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,981
It's a valid
sexual orientation,

140
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,579
according to this article,
at least.

141
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,985
<i>Yeah, I think I read that, too.
Is that Fugliness Weekly?</i>

142
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,823
She's perfectly
fine-looking.

143
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:04,987
Happily married for 10 years.

144
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,156
To a guy who loves penis
enough for both of them.

145
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,460
He's asexual, too.

146
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,967
Ran a complete physical on her.

147
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,301
Nothing wrong except a
common bladder infection.

148
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,035
Hundred bucks says
I can find a medical reason

149
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,203
why she doesn't want
to have sex.

150
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,803
You're out of your mind
if you think

151
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,610
I'm letting you anywhere
near my patient.

152
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,116
Fine, I won't go near her.

153
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,984
Just give me her file and any
blood samples you have leftover.

154
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,692
No contact whatsoever. You
talk to her, the bet is void.

155
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:40,321
No contact. Plays to
my strengths, anyway.

156
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,129
Right now's not
a good time, House.

157
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,902
Not for the Dean of Medicine,

158
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,375
but it's the perfect time if
you're a member of my team.

159
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,241
Which one are you?

160
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,346
What did the endoscopy show?

161
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,050
No signs of
ulcers or blockages.

162
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,218
But you found a tear
just below the esophagus.

163
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,384
Explains the bleeding.

164
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,258
Doesn't explain why he vomited
so hard he ripped his insides.

165
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:15,060
His liver enzymes are slightly elevated.
Gallstones could...

166
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,498
No complaints of pain.

167
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:20,060
Steatohepatitis would make
his AST and ATL levels rise.

168
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,900
Are you calling his liver fat?

169
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,572
Start the patient on statins,

170
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,008
do a biopsy to confirm.

171
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,944
And knock him out, I've
heard he's a wiggler.

172
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,105
There's no need
to put him under.

173
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:33,377
We can confirm fatty liver
with an ultrasound.

174
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,417
Just making an observation.

175
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:40,015
Well done. And now,
as a member of my team,

176
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,118
you can make the equally useful
observations that the sky is blue,

177
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:46,686
I'm wearing pants, and I'm
ignoring your first observation.

178
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,123
Of course.

179
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:54,928
Wait.

180
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,473
And there it is.

181
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,604
You're trying to screw
with my confidence.

182
00:09:58,698 --> 00:09:59,733
Well, if I wanted to do that,

183
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,437
I'd tell you how much
the nurses hate you.

184
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,140
You're trying to get me to
define myself as a subordinate

185
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,114
to keep me from
ever intervening,

186
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,482
even if it's fully in
the scope of my duties.

187
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,885
Like now. This isn't
about diagnostics,

188
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,218
it's about what's safe
for the patient.

189
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:13,918
Do the ultrasound.

190
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,823
Ultrasound it is.

191
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,994
And the nurses love you.

192
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,100
You don't think I knew House was
gonna tell you to ignore me

193
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,661
and not do the ultrasound?

194
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,505
This is an ultrasound machine.

195
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:32,304
Which you're gonna use to do
an ultrasound-guided biopsy.

196
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,778
You've probably got
a kit stashed here...

197
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:49,018
"Cuddy Dark will waste his afternoon
chasing conspiracy theories."

198
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,026
You're letting him
get inside your head.

199
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,994
He can do a lot
of damage in there.

200
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,025
Dr. Chase,
he started vomiting again.

201
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,003
This is why we stopped
the antiemetics.

202
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,666
We needed to see if
it was still a symptom.

203
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,936
Okay.

204
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,436
Here. You want this?

205
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,641
Get your hands off me.
You're taking my head!

206
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,948
It's okay, Andres.
You're in the hospital.

207
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:23,994
10 milligrams of diazepam.

208
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,461
Already on it.

209
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,225
Hey! NATALIE: I'm fine.
I'm fine.

210
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,862
Foreman.

211
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,634
Blood in his urine.

212
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,346
We resumed the antiemetics
and increased his sedation.

213
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,645
He really went after her.

214
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,708
Maybe he found out
about her "good friend."

215
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,379
It was just paranoid rage.
Typical of Alzheimer's.

216
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,922
We don't even know if they
were sleeping together.

217
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,083
A few hours ago, you were sure.

218
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,388
And that's significant why?

219
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,089
Sorry, only the bleeding's
medically relevant.

220
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,563
No' I wasn't being rhetorical.

221
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:05,659
If they are sleeping together,
why do we disapprove?

222
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,434
You're pro infidelity?

223
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:09,700
She's not married.

224
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,738
If marriage is feeding
and cleaning someone

225
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,337
and limiting conversation to
repeating a few simple commands,

226
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,110
then I was married
to my pet rat.

227
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,708
And a lot of people
owe me wedding gifts.

228
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,718
And we're walking,
we're walking.

229
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:27,256
I don't care how sick your spouse
gets, you don't jump ship.

230
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,351
Alzheimer's is different. She can't
share her problems with him,

231
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,794
or plan for the future. The man
she married no longer exists.

232
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,364
Yes, he does.
He's in there.

233
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,525
This is why you get married.

234
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,260
Said the divorced woman
to the divorced man.

235
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:43,603
I didn't jump ship. My husband
sank it when he cheated on me.

236
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,266
Commitment's not conditional.

237
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:48,209
She is there for him in the
only way that matters now.

238
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,609
She gave up her life
to take care of him.

239
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:50,806
Proves she's an idiot.

240
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,110
If she had any sense, she'd
have stuck him in a facility

241
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,617
and jumped on that strange...

242
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,313
Dr. Foreman. We were
just looking for you.

243
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,321
I was right about
the antiemetics.

244
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:00,720
If we kept him on them
like I said,

245
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,759
he wouldn't have gotten
agitated and punched his wife.

246
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,419
Yes, we're back to my
supposed diabolical plan

247
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,294
to shake your confidence.

248
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,560
Let's see if this helps.

249
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:12,000
If you're speaking
as a team member,

250
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,434
then I'd say you're a moron.

251
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,232
'Cause taking him
off the antiemetics

252
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,172
gave us crucial
diagnostic information.

253
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,574
If you're speaking as Dean of Medicine,
then I'd say you're a moron.

254
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,238
'Cause your micromanaging
kept us from doing a biopsy.

255
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,907
And if we had, the patient would've
been anesthetized hours ago

256
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,645
<i>thus unable to go all
Chris Brown on her ass.</i>

257
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,585
Unless one of your index
cards actually predicted

258
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:32,918
the guy was
gonna punch his wife,

259
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:36,084
everything you're saying is
post hoc rationalization.

260
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,755
Dr. Park, would you please
reach under that chair?

261
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,099
"The patient will
punch his wife."

262
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,769
You clearly wrote that
after the fact.

263
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,306
Dr. Adams, would you please
reach into my pants?

264
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,711
"Dr. Blackenshmurtz
will accuse me

265
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:05,517
"of writing about the
punch after the fact."

266
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,386
And look,
there's a photograph of me

267
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,620
holding a newspaper
dated last Tuesday.

268
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,128
How could I have gotten
my hands on that?

269
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,631
You done? Rhabdomyolysis
fits the vomiting,

270
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,133
pigmenturia and renal failure.

271
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,396
No muscle symptoms and
urine had no myoglobin.

272
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,461
TTP fits, though.

273
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:25,473
Start him on plasmapheresis.
Unless...

274
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,806
Unless I need to say,
"Mother, may I?"

275
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,244
And "mother's" an abbreviation.

276
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,212
Fresh plasma will replace
the damaged red blood cells

277
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:40,382
that are clogging his kidneys.

278
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,481
That sounds hopeful.

279
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,060
How's that feeling?

280
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,392
I've never been hit in the eye before.

281
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,333
I feel kind of badass.

282
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,564
I think maybe you should go.

283
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,663
Look, I'm fine, okay?

284
00:14:58,498 --> 00:14:59,568
I'll see you tomorrow?

285
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:00,769
Okay.

286
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,577
We're not having an affair.

287
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,912
It's none of my business.

288
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,113
I mean, not really.

289
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:16,121
'Cause nothings happened, but we've
talked about it a lot and...

290
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,593
It's just really hard
doing this by myself.

291
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,194
When's the last time you
had a full night's sleep?

292
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,364
Um...

293
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,469
I don't know.
Three years?

294
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,538
You're not gonna
get any rest here.

295
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,272
People who are sick
are not the only ones

296
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,282
who need to be taken care of.

297
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,884
Why doesn't Chase
have to be here?

298
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,954
You think he knows anything about
women who don't want to have sex?

299
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:59,296
Hormone levels are normal. This
woman seems perfectly healthy.

300
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,133
What does it matter
if she says she's asexual?

301
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:04,231
It's the fundamental drive of our species.
Sex is healthy.

302
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,970
Orgasms oxygenate the brain,

303
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,635
lighting up over
30 different areas

304
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,407
and making us forget how
boring Susie Cooper is.

305
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,078
That last one may
not be universal.

306
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,982
How about damage
to her spinal cord,

307
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,816
blocking the signals
from her genitals?

308
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,480
Sex drive is in the brain.

309
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:22,651
I suppose it could be
psychological intimacy issues

310
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,091
caused by childhood abuse.

311
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,823
She's been sharing a toilet with the
same guy for the last 10 years.

312
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,989
It's not the same.

313
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,330
Sex releases oxytocin, it's the
neurochemical basis for bonding.

314
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,665
And that's why men always
marry their right hands.

315
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,829
It's different for girls.

316
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,032
No, it's not.
I've tapped over 30 guys

317
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,767
and never wanted to
see most of them again.

318
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,271
I lived next to a Jewish frat.

319
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,215
We are veering wildly off track.
Please continue.

320
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,219
This woman's life is probably
better off without sex.

321
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,517
Eliminates most of
her insecurities,

322
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:53,989
she's immune to
most advertising,

323
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,822
and can have honest
relationships with men.

324
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,062
Not a lot of them.

325
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,791
We've run every lest and
ruled out all the options.

326
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,334
You're gonna have to accept
she just doesn't want sex.

327
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,801
Lots of people don't have sex.

328
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,201
The only people
who don't want it

329
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,863
are either sick, dead or lying.

330
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,304
So maybe she's lying.

331
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,172
You think she's had
a boyfriend on the side?

332
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,335
For 10 years?

333
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,642
Sticking around the whole time?
It doesn't make sense.

334
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,878
What does.“

335
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:27,984
Thirty?

336
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:29,986
Everybody lies.

337
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,997
Higher or lower?

338
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,930
Followed your advice
and took the night off.

339
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,269
It seems to have
done you some good.

340
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,706
Mmm-hmm.

341
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,283
Where's my husband?

342
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,713
He's not in the hospital.

343
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:57,880
So he just walked out?

344
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,515
All of the shift nurses had their
hands full with a double code.

345
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,287
Perfectly
reasonable explanation.

346
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,861
Same thing happened to me.
Couldn't find my keys for days.

347
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,261
The police have been notified,
I have staff searching.

348
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,595
You told me
it was okay to leave.

349
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,528
I'm sorry.

350
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,801
He has Alzheimer's!
It's freezing outside!

351
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,533
And he's sick!

352
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,804
I mean, you don't even know
what it is yet, do you'?

353
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,901
The plasmapheresis
hasn't had time to work,

354
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,447
but TTP is our most likely...

355
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:24,981
Okay, I have to
go look for him.

356
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:29,546
Hey. Don't be an ass.
Can't you see she's upset?

357
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,555
No, she's guilty.

358
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:36,554
Instead of being at her husband's
side, she was under you.

359
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,220
Okay. That's...

360
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,094
Yeah, he already
said I was an ass.

361
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,595
Personally, I applaud your decision
to step down off your cross

362
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,898
and get on with your life,
but your misplaced guilt

363
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,267
is shutting down your brain.

364
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,774
We need you to sit, focus,
and answer our questions.

365
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,149
So it's 6:00 a.m.,
patient wakes up,

366
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,819
and the first thing he sees...

367
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:09,791
In moments of confusion, Alzheimer's
patients regress to old routines.

368
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,193
So what would your husband
do on a Saturday morning?

369
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:15,122
Nothing. Be at home.

370
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,497
What about a year ago,
five years, or 10?

371
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:19,698
I don't know.

372
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,195
He trained for a marathon once.

373
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,104
Soccer practice.
We took a cooking class.

374
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,113
The soccer trophy you were
telling me about, it's gone.

375
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,273
Where was practice?

376
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,113
It was close to here,
on Chesterfield.

377
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,328
Okay, he comes, he thinks
he's wailing for practice.

378
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,562
He'd want to get out
of the wind,

379
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,162
but somewhere he could
see the kids arrive.

380
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,635
There.

381
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,707
Over here!

382
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,714
On three.
One, two, three.

383
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,385
Nothing.

384
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,396
Not dead till
he's warm and dead.

385
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:30,836
Get him to the ICU.

386
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,705
Start him on
extracorporeal circulation.

387
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,210
That'll raise his temperature too
quickly it'll cause acidosis.

388
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,041
We can deal with
his metabolism crashing.

389
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,206
We can't reverse brain
damage if we go too slowly.

390
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,079
Either way, if we don't get
his temperature above 95,

391
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,243
it's not gonna matter.

392
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,844
Multiple warm lavage is safer.

393
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,223
Do what House says.

394
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:01,595
He has no heartbeat,
he's not breathing.

395
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,939
How can he not be dead?

396
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:08,804
Body slows down when it cools,
but it doesn't fully stop.

397
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,973
We're warming his blood outside of
his body and then putting it back.

398
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,448
It'll raise his
temperature enough

399
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:15,541
that his heart
should naturally start.

400
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,750
Then we can shock it
back into rhythm.

401
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,879
And if it doesn't start?

402
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,889
Then there's nothing we can do.

403
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,899
You think it's possible he
knew what he was doing?

404
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:37,340
Like some part of him gets what
he's putting his wife through,

405
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,931
so he tried to...
Kill himself?

406
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,067
It's what I'd do if I were him.

407
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,977
At least I wish I would.

408
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,974
I meant run away.

409
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,016
You think you should kill
yourself if you become a burden

410
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,179
to the people who love you?

411
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:54,986
If you really loved
them back, then yes.

412
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,326
That's really dark.

413
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,261
It's not naive.

414
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:07,795
I just believe people are capable
of more than you do, apparently.

415
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,269
We've got brain activity.

416
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,776
Temp's at 93. His heart
should start soon.

417
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:24,387
My dad left me alone to
care for my alcoholic mom

418
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,716
and raise my baby sister.

419
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,290
I was just a teenager.

420
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,989
I spent half of my time
changing diapers

421
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,288
and the other half
cleaning up my mom's vomit.

422
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,389
But it must have been important

423
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,626
that you stayed
for both of them.

424
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:40,535
Mom died after a few years.

425
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:44,233
It was ugly and painful, and
she went with me hating her.

426
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,571
My sister ended up drinking
half of her life away

427
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,305
and hating me
because I couldn't help.

428
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,143
After Mom, I had nothing left.

429
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:56,518
So do I wish Mom had used a
gun instead of a bottle?

430
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:57,848
Yes.

431
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,352
I didn't know.

432
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:03,825
That's why I told you.

433
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,490
Ventricular fibrillation.

434
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:14,198
Give him 300 milligrams
amiodarone.

435
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,009
Be careful.
Once we establish rhythm,

436
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,518
any accidental movement could
crash him back into V-fib.

437
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,246
Clear.

438
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,966
We still have a long way to go.

439
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:46,627
Cold can be protective
to the brain,

440
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:50,104
but there is a
possibility of damage.

441
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:54,541
We also need to confirm and treat
whatever's making him sick.

442
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,213
I just gotta do
a standard battery of tests.

443
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,376
Blood, urine, EEG.

444
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,784
Is that really necessary
for a free flu shot'?

445
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,556
Excuse me, I have to deal with
someone who's having a panic attack.

446
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,231
I specifically said
the bet was off

447
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,771
if you contacted the patient.

448
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,808
Exactly. You never said anything
about the patient's husband.

449
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:29,302
The deal was a medical reason
why she doesn't have sex.

450
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,438
I admit I was stuck
until I realized

451
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,279
that the medical issue
was not hers, but his.

452
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,913
She's lying to compensate.
It's a tale as old as time.

453
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,150
Boy meets girl.
Girl falls for boy.

454
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,986
<i>Boy says,
"I'm asexual."</i>

455
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:43,856
<i>Girls says,
"Yeah, me, too."</i>

456
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,491
Your twisted logic
can't hide the fact

457
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,361
that tricking a patient
into being tested

458
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:50,991
is completely unethical.

459
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:55,200
Come on. Don't you think she
deserves to know why her husband

460
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:57,501
won't bend her over
the kitchen counter?

461
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,303
You love all that caring crap.

462
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:01,436
You're not doing this out of
the kindness of your heart.

463
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,878
You're not even doing this
out of medical curiosity.

464
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,142
I thought I made it clear
I'm doing it for the cash.

465
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,714
Two people are happy, and your
natural impulse is to destroy it.

466
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,788
How do you know she's happy?
Did she tell you?

467
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:15,451
No, chirping birds flew out of
her butt carrying a banner.

468
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,357
All right' I admit
that my natural impulse

469
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,224
is to doubt people's
claims to happiness,

470
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:21,457
but yours is
to be a sucker for them.

471
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,158
You tell me which one's worse.

472
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:35,543
He just opened his eyes
a little while ago.

473
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:40,242
His heartbeat's doing well and
his body temperature stabilized.

474
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:50,987
There he is.

475
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:57,496
Is that Portuguese?

476
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,899
Yeah.

477
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,937
Honey, I don't understand.

478
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,702
What's he saying?

479
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,079
I don't know.

480
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:15,011
I tried to learn when we
got married, but I just...

481
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,087
It's okay, it's okay.

482
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:27,724
His body temperature is rising.
It's above normal.

483
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:31,461
Wait, I thought you said it was
stable Why is it still rising?

484
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,059
I don't know.

485
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:38,098
Vomiting, liver, kidneys
and now fever.

486
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,740
I don't want to tell you how
to do your job, Dr. Foreman,

487
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:46,305
since telling people how to
do their job is your job.

488
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:48,742
But when your
less-than-competent

489
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,309
administration of this hospital

490
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,319
affects what's written
on my whiteboard...

491
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,481
Get to the point.

492
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:56,059
The word "fever." Could come
from the patient's illness

493
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,822
or it could come from the
fact that you allowed him

494
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,556
to saunter out of your hospital
and take a nap in the snow.

495
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,726
He couldn't have caught a
virus while he was outside,

496
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,392
fever came on too fast.

497
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,663
The hypothermia could have
caused cell necrosis.

498
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,631
TTP was the diagnosis
when he walked out.

499
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,937
Fever's a little high,
but it still fits.

500
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,671
We should
continue plasmapheresis.

501
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,270
We're missing symptoms.

502
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,476
We should add language
loss and aggression.

503
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,075
Should we also add forgetfulness?
He's got Alzheimer's.

504
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,246
We've just been assuming.

505
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,812
Because the patient's wife said
he exhibited both for a year.

506
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,858
He's never hit her before
or lost all his English.

507
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,255
We have to consider any change

508
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,521
since he's been
admitted as relevant.

509
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:35,094
"Have to?" Do I need
to pull out another card?

510
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,295
Disseminated viral infection,
with encephalitis.

511
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,102
Patient complained of a sore
throat a few weeks ago.

512
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,507
Start him on interferon.

513
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,714
Encephalitis
makes his brain swell,

514
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,718
which causes symptoms that are hard
to distinguish from his Alzheimer's.

515
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,846
With the interferon, his
English should come back

516
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,720
and the aggression
should subside.

517
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:03,453
But you're not sure?

518
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,990
Unfortunately, no.

519
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:10,796
And you're not sure if he has
brain damage from being frozen?

520
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:17,170
So best-case scenario,

521
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,873
I just had a glimpse
into his future?

522
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,510
I can't take care
of him anymore.

523
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:29,883
Chances are his
menial state will improve.

524
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:31,648
You could get
more time with him.

525
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:36,186
We married six months
after I met him.

526
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,922
A year after that,
he started forgetting things.

527
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:45,034
I've known my husband longer with
his Alzheimer's than without.

528
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,162
I've watched more of him disappear
than I ever got to know.

529
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,734
I just can't do this anymore.

530
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,940
You lose.

531
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:03,418
Blood work shows
high levels of prolactin.

532
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,250
Add that to some peripheral
red-green confusion,

533
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:11,021
puts my money, excuse me, your
money, soon to be my money,

534
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:13,363
on a tumor near his pituitary.

535
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,455
Probably started growing
in his early teens.

536
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:20,060
Lowering his libido and
causing erectile dysfunction.

537
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,729
A year on dopamine agonists

538
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,433
and he'll be a sex-crazed creep
just like the rest of us.

539
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:28,106
Completely fascinated
by Susie Cooper.

540
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,306
I would prefer to be paid
in a single $100 bill.

541
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,576
Always wanted to use one
to light a cigar.

542
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,585
Hooray for us. We
disproved his asexuality.

543
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,590
We also probably
ruined his life.

544
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:43,149
He'll thank us.
Then he'll doze off.

545
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,785
And then, in a couple of
hours, he'll thank us again.

546
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,886
It could destroy his identity.

547
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:51,093
It's like a gay person being
told they're really straight.

548
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:52,626
So don't tell him.

549
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,637
Yeah, why bother telling a guy he
has a tumor growing in his head?

550
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,105
He'll notice it eventually when
it starts leaking out his ears.

551
00:29:58,163 --> 00:29:59,574
It's a slow-growing tumor.

552
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,633
He'll probably die of
boredom long before that.

553
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:08,980
You always do this. You meddle and
force me into impossible situations.

554
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,416
You knew the second you told me

555
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,012
about this case
that I'd get involved.

556
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,954
You wanted me to meddle.

557
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,320
'Cause no matter
how much you wanted

558
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,088
to believe
in this chaste romance,

559
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,254
you didn't buy it either.

560
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,654
Where's that petition
House's PO sent over

561
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,631
about him getting
his ankle monitor off?

562
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,135
On your desk.

563
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:45,820
You played me.

564
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,323
This whole thing was
about your ankle monitor.

565
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:50,987
You weren't trying to
undermine my confidence,

566
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,153
you were trying to inflate it.

567
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,527
You manufactured
conflict with me

568
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,962
so, eventually,
you could let me win.

569
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:57,731
You knew it was encephalitis,

570
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:58,858
but you waited
for me to say it,

571
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,300
because then,
with my ego boosted,

572
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,305
you thought I'd be in the mood
to take off your monitor.

573
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,307
Because I'd think
I could control you.

574
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:10,411
You're right.
Take off my monitor.

575
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,417
See, the beauty of the plan

576
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:17,214
is if ii works, then you
think you can control me.

577
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:20,051
If it fails,
then you will actually

578
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:22,216
have proven that
you can control me.

579
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,085
It's pretty genius.

580
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,422
These are your training wheels.

581
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,023
If you think you're up to this
job, it's time to lose them.

582
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,947
Second half of my plan
might need work.

583
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,424
V-fib.
Two rounds at 360

584
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,394
without establishing a rhythm.

585
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,424
Wait! Dr. Foreman!

586
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,431
Clear.

587
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:13,872
He's back.

588
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,546
I sure hope this
Alzheimer's drug trial

589
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,989
is worth a lot
to this hospital,

590
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,720
'cause we're wasting a
crapload of time and man power

591
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,626
just to let this guy
watch his mind shrivel

592
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:34,822
and keep his wife miserable.

593
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,799
Heart attack while he was on
interferon rules out encephalitis,

594
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,130
but I still think I'm right
about the neuro symptoms.

595
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:41,829
It's probably
aseptic meningitis.

596
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:43,304
We would have
seen meningeal signs.

597
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,306
Given his abnormal mental
status, not necessarily.

598
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,274
Dr. Foreman! Would you please
reach under your chair'?

599
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:55,981
It's just wet gum under here.

600
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,950
Where's the card?
What card?

601
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:04,086
I'm happy to leave if you have a
better theory than aseptic meningitis.

602
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,287
Toxins.

603
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,693
If this guy went
on a walkabout,

604
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,093
chances are
he's done it before.

605
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,188
Wife keeps the doors
in the house locked.

606
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,664
There's plenty of
nasty stuff to get into

607
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:11,927
during the middle of the night.

608
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,162
We asked about toxins
on the history.

609
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,761
The wife said she was sure to clear
the house for her husband's safety.

610
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,965
And I'm sure she succeeded.

611
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,030
She's a PhD
in toxicology, right?

612
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:23,176
She's an ex-florist. Search
the home for toxic plants,

613
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,043
methyl bromide,
any medications.

614
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:29,342
Stop.
You're not infallible.

615
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:30,476
You were wrong
about encephalitis.

616
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:31,543
Just before you were.

617
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:34,180
Run CSF tests, find out what's
causing the meningitis.

618
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,691
You said you weren't gonna
overrule me, diagnostically.

619
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,195
And you said I wouldn't
be able to help it.

620
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:43,197
Apparently, you were
right about that one.

621
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,634
Fine. I'll look
for toxins myself.

622
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,730
You can't go to their house
without Foreman's permission.

623
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:54,641
Don't need it, I'm gonna talk
to the toxicology PhD upstairs.

624
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,736
What about gifts
from South America?

625
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:59,338
Anyone send any
fruits or vegetables?

626
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,582
I don't think so... No.

627
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,723
I'm gonna need your boyfriend
to collect samples of plants

628
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,191
in and around your house.
Toxins are the most...

629
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:21,231
Wait. You understand him?
What's he saying?

630
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,342
He's repeating
"blue shack."

631
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,071
You know what that is?

632
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,442
Is it somewhere where
pesticides may be kept?

633
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,183
It's where
we had our first date.

634
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:42,014
Do you have a cleaning lady who
might bring her own supplies?

635
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,087
What's he saying?

636
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,253
If it's not relevant to the case, I
don't care, and neither should you.

637
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:49,764
Please.

638
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,899
This might be the last time I
ever know what he's thinking.

639
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,102
"When I saw her waiting...

640
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,149
"Waiting for me at the table...

641
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,617
"The way her eyes looked
when she smiled...

642
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:16,248
"I felt like crying.

643
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:24,424
"I knew she was the woman
I wanted to marry.

644
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,836
"And every time
I see her, I say...

645
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,800
"There she is."
"There she is."

646
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:42,178
He's still in there.

647
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,753
What did he say?

648
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,684
He asked who you were.

649
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:58,458
Don't get your hopes up.

650
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,037
Have your boyfriend
get me those samples.

651
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,177
How did you even know
to look for a tumor?

652
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:18,654
Dr. House noticed hormone
levels in your blood

653
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,656
and consulted with me
as an oncologist...

654
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,453
Who cares how they found it, okay?
They found it.

655
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:25,351
Are there any side effects
to the treatment?

656
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:30,656
Some nausea, dizziness,
and as the tumor shrinks,

657
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,702
there will be
behavioral changes.

658
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:34,527
Like what?

659
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:35,969
Well...

660
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:40,308
The tumor interferes with
certain natural systems.

661
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:46,975
It lowers libido and causes
erectile dysfunction.

662
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:54,587
You mean the treatment will
make me want to have sex'?

663
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,759
What if I don't
want the treatment?

664
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,488
I would strongly advise...

665
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,259
Look, you have
a brain tumor, okay?

666
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,388
You have to have the treatment.

667
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:05,866
Okay, look,
I know who I am, okay?

668
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:07,028
And I'm not one of them.

669
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:09,868
Hey, look, we'll adjust.

670
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:13,171
Okay? We can go
through this together.

671
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,610
You mean have sex?
I can't make you do that.

672
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,412
Maybe it won't be so bad.

673
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:20,915
It'll be terrible.

674
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,415
It's actually pretty fun.

675
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,192
From what I remember.

676
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,688
But you said that...
I know.

677
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,929
I know. I wanted to
spend my life with you

678
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,696
and I knew that meant
making certain sacrifices.

679
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,069
But a girl has needs.

680
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:52,374
<i>You dropped
in the US. News rankings.</i>

681
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,611
With respect, Mr. Laffont, that's
only because we temporarily

682
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,276
shut down our
diagnostics department.

683
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,649
It's up and running again.

684
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,314
I'm actually concerned it might be
because of the change in management.

685
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:04,950
If you want my money, I'll
need to see a five year plan.

686
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:10,324
Am I boring you?

687
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:17,939
No, I just, those flowers
are from last week.

688
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:19,998
They should be dead by now.

689
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:21,168
Excuse me?

690
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:25,979
Sorry, I have to go.

691
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:39,662
It's Reye's Syndrome.

692
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:42,425
Patient had a sore throat a few
weeks ago before he was admitted.

693
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,763
Reye's in adults is a reach.

694
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:45,961
Not if he took aspirin.

695
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:48,197
Aspirin in adults is a reach.

696
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:50,432
Especially in a house
with locked medicine cabinets.

697
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:51,838
It wasn't in
the medicine cabinet.

698
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,342
The wife used to
run a floral company,

699
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,843
still does a few orders
from home.

700
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:57,811
She uses crushed aspirin
in the water

701
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,712
to make the flowers
last longer.

702
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,679
So the husband
has a sore throat,

703
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,345
takes an aspirin
without her knowing,

704
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,320
realizes he's got a sore
throat, takes an aspirin,

705
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,652
realizes he's got
a sore throat...

706
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:11,193
You can stop me
whenever you like.

707
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,352
Have Chase start him
on steroids.

708
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,125
I already did.

709
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,566
Then why are you telling me?

710
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,693
Because I wanted you
to hear it from me.

711
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,400
There she is.

712
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,106
Here I am.

713
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:03,609
Your eye.
What happened?

714
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:08,615
It's nothing I can't handle.

715
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:24,925
MRI confirmed
macroprolactinoma.

716
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,096
He's doing the treatment

717
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,295
And the wife?

718
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:40,243
Come on.
We saved a man's life,

719
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:44,151
course-corrected two people's
wildly screwed up worldviews.

720
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,290
Not bad for a day's work.

721
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:54,830
I think they were happy, even
if it was based on lies.

722
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,762
Most happiness is.

723
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,426
Better to have shtupped
and lost

724
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,403
than never to
have shtupped at all.

725
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:05,965
We can't smoke in here.

726
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:12,908
We also can't summon people
into the clinic based on a lie

727
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:16,316
motivated by a petty bet,
and yet it happens.

728
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,580
It's an imperfect world.

729
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,328
Well?

730
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,594
Disgustingly satisfying.

731
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:41,936
He said it was okay.

732
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,105
Is one of you Dr. House?

733
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,781
You've seen Spartacus, right?

734
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:49,842
I got an order here to deactivate
and remove his ankle monitor.

735
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:04,861
Robbie?

736
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,299
Hey, sis.

737
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,063
<i>It's been years.</i>

738
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:11,469
I know.

739
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,804
I thought of you
on Mom's birthday.

740
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,802
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

741
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,349
Yeah, yeah.
Fine. I just...

742
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:24,715
wanted to see how you were.

743
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:25,981
<i>I'm fine.</i>

744
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:42,565
Bikes go faster
without training wheels.

745
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:50,209
Now get out, I have work to do.

746
00:42:58,009 --> 00:42:59,920
Whoops.
