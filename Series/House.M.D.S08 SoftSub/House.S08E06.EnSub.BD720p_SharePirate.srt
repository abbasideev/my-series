1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,280
Okay, boys and girls.

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,478
Guess what kind of animal
Wacky Benny's making now.

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,149
Give you a big hint.

4
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,061
Is it a dead animal?

5
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:25,866
I say we put him out of his
misery and bring out Emma's cake.

6
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,474
He's so new to this. How's he
gonna learn if we stop his act?

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,873
You're a sucky clown.

8
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,573
And you're
a super-duper audience.

9
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:39,979
Hey, that is not okay.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,576
Hey' keep your
hands off my son!

11
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:44,246
Tell him to keep
his hands off me.

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,664
I can't move my arm or leg.

13
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,796
So how does a completely healthy
teenager have a mini-stroke?

14
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:34,099
Head CT and cerebral
angiogram are normal,

15
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,434
clotting parameters are normal.

16
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,204
You're forgetting the wrinkly
clump in the middle of his shirt.

17
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,304
Thought we'd diagnose
the middle-aged clown first.

18
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,247
It's probably from my seatbelt.

19
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,545
Wrinkle pattern's too varied.

20
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,587
Looks like someone shoved
you. Or grabbed you.

21
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,815
Probably from the diaper bag
If the patient's using drugs,

22
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,255
cocaine could've caused an
arterial spasm in his brain...

23
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,485
Tox screen's clean.

24
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,755
I'm gonna say it was the
ex-girlfriend you cheated on,

25
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,491
not the ex-wife
you cheated with

26
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:00,963
because if the latter
was prone to violence,

27
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:05,093
you'd have been scattered in
various dumpsters years ago.

28
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,130
Seriously?

29
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,105
No one else wants to
talk about the patient?

30
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,940
New office furniture.
Meaty topic.

31
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,639
What's the action
on the ex-wife?

32
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,442
It was Rachel's boyfriend Phil.

33
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,179
His company's moving
him back to Portland.

34
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,015
He wants me to
change my visitation order

35
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,785
so he can ask Rachel and my
daughter to move out west with him.

36
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,258
Things got a little heated.

37
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,355
The patient was
punched in the groin,

38
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,262
could've triggered a massive
sympathetic discharge...

39
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,767
Carotid duplex is normal.

40
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,099
And who's better
qualified to be the daddy?

41
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,038
The guy who spilled a little
DNA in her gene pool,

42
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,699
or the guy who's gonna
be there day and night

43
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:48,303
to pass on important values like not
shtupping Mommy after the divorce?

44
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,975
I am her daddy.
She's staying here.

45
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,279
House has a point.

46
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,843
A couple nights a week with each
kid may make you feel better.

47
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,785
It doesn't replace
two round-the-clock parents.

48
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,324
Round-the-clock or not,
parenting's an impossible job.

49
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,155
No way not to mess it up.

50
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,023
Why shouldn't Taub
be the one to do it?

51
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,163
- Thank you.
- Makes sense.

52
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,995
Park's tiger mom and dad
were so insufferable,

53
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,229
she has to measure
their affection in hours.

54
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,794
Chase's careerist dad and alcoholic
mom were so indifferent,

55
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,204
he has to believe it's a wash.

56
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,331
Your turn.

57
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:18,875
What did your
screwed-up parents do

58
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,410
to screw up your
view of parenting?

59
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,237
They were good parents.

60
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,009
That's an oxymoron.

61
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,746
Chase is right, all parents
screw up all children.

62
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,843
He's also dreamy,
but it's not relevant now.

63
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,753
So all parents
screw up all children,

64
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,688
but it makes
some huge difference

65
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,657
if I keep my daughter
here or let her move?

66
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,757
Endocarditis, flipped a piece
of vegetation into his brain,

67
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,525
which could've broken up
before the angiogram.

68
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,693
Transesophageal
echo to confirm.

69
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,067
And screwed up
is her best-case.

70
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,605
Bouncing between
a philandering, workaholic dad

71
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,369
and an embittered'
sexually-betrayed mom,

72
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,104
it's gonna lead to
screwed-up squared.

73
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,510
Is endocarditis treatable?

74
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:58,844
VET?

75
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,385
The echo will show us any
growths on his heart valve.

76
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,581
Most likely meds'll be enough,
he won't even need surgery.

77
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:08,415
He's just taken up performing,
and it's very stressful for him.

78
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,220
Could that have caused this?

79
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,229
It's not stressful, I have fun.

80
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,423
Stress wouldn't be relevant.

81
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,932
But anything that increases his
adrenaline could have made it worse.

82
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,295
Maybe we find you a new hobby.
One you're a little better at.

83
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:25,603
I'm gonna get better at it,
and it's not a hobby.

84
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,143
I think I want to
get a job working

85
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,145
as a circus clown,
making people laugh.

86
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,647
Ben, I don't think
that's a good idea.

87
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:36,948
It was good enough for my dad.

88
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,589
You were a...

89
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,125
His biological father.

90
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,161
Could his dad's
melanoma be a factor here?

91
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,390
That wouldn't be related.

92
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,061
Ben, you barely knew him.

93
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,158
You're such a smart kid,

94
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,568
you could aim a lot higher than
face paint and seltzer bottles.

95
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,910
I need treatment for
my Type 2 diabetes.

96
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,141
There is absolutely no part of
that sentence that is true.

97
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,116
I've been experiencing weight
gain, fatigue and sluggishness.

98
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:10,153
Weight loss is
a symptom of diabetes.

99
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,779
Fatigue is a symptom
of thinking you

100
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,448
have a disease you
don't actually have.

101
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,993
And sluggishness is
a synonym of fatigue.

102
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,187
I need insulin. I know it.

103
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:21,698
Much as I'd like to kill you by
dangerously lowering your blood sugar,

104
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,597
murder violates my parole.

105
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,433
That blood work is weeks old.
Test me again.

106
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,269
I am the test.
The test is negative.

107
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,266
The test also thinks you're
a giant pain in the ass.

108
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,977
That last insult
was your cue to leave.

109
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,277
Test me.

110
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,277
Fine. Wait right here.

111
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,120
Thank you.

112
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,792
Sleep study.
Please make sure he's

113
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,660
not disturbed for
the next eight hours.

114
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,400
We need to talk
about Saturday night.

115
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,469
No, no, no, no, no.

116
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:02,739
Historians will talk of
Saturday night, not us.

117
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,675
The legendary night on which we
watch Santos shatter Rubio's jaw

118
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,575
and you epically pay me $50.

119
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,978
I have a chance
to really watch it.

120
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,347
A patient of mine has a pair
of tickets he can't use.

121
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:18,081
And obviously you're under
house and office arrest,

122
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,351
I just wanted to
make sure you were cool

123
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,653
if I go to Atlantic
City without you.

124
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,059
No, thanks.

125
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,925
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to decline your invitation

126
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,999
to not spend
Saturday night with you.

127
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,497
These are ringside seats.

128
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,331
Cameras are ringside, too.

129
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,995
If you want,
I could sweat and spit

130
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,107
and bleed on you
from time to time.

131
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,835
I'd take you if I could.

132
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,536
Well, I'd take me if
either of us could.

133
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,779
See what a tough spot I'm in?

134
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,405
I'm going to that fight.

135
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,519
All right, I'll take
the other ticket.

136
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,083
Let me worry about logistics.

137
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,233
Patient's heart valves are normal.
It's not endocarditis.

138
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,428
But he has a thickened
pericardium, which makes no sense.

139
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:10,406
He has a heart problem, but not
one that could've caused his TIA.

140
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,203
Syphilitic vasculitis
would explain the TIA

141
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,038
and the pericardial
inflammation.

142
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,240
Syph test was negative. Plus, the
kid's never been sexually active.

143
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,544
Yeah, I got that from the line on his
chart that says "birthday clown.

144
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,211
His late father
was a circus clown.

145
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:23,881
Histoplasmosis.

146
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,115
He's not immunocompromised.

147
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,088
And I assume you added
that irrelevant tidbit

148
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,318
because you're moved
by the son's idiotic tribute,

149
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,726
and think it justifies keeping
your daughter in New Jersey.

150
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,492
But what if he has
a heightened immune system.

151
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,896
I mentioned it because.“

152
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,232
Take your time.
We'll continue with medicine.

153
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,069
Sjögren's could've
given him chronic

154
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,904
pericarditis and
cerebral arteritis.

155
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,741
Sjögren's it is. IV
immunosuppressants to treat.

156
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,913
Anything?

157
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,583
This'll calm
your immune system.

158
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,086
You should be out of
here within the week.

159
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,682
My mom'll be
happy to hear that.

160
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,090
I've got an internship
that starts in three weeks.

161
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,960
I take it it's not at
a place with a big top.

162
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,593
It's in my stepdad's
law office.

163
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,264
I know I'm not any
good at being a clown yet,

164
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,633
but when I do get a laugh,

165
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,938
see those kids' eyes light up,

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,277
that's how my dad made
me feel when I was a kid.

167
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,173
You need to hang onto that.

168
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:32,289
My mom says he
was a loving father,

169
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,792
but always broke and
always on the road.

170
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,785
It's a stupid way
to make a living.

171
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,991
You're 16. Plenty of
time to make money.

172
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:47,062
Wanting to build
a connection with your dad,

173
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,799
pass on some of
the joy that he gave you,

174
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,473
that's not stupid at all.

175
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,012
I got it.

176
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:07,591
Is this because of
the medication? Is it normal?

177
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:16,524
It's not normal,
and ifs not Sjögren's.

178
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,840
TIA, thickened
pericardium, and now

179
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,242
he's bleeding from
his nose and mouth.

180
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,043
What are you doing with her?

181
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,013
"Her"?

182
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:39,187
Surely this little bundle
of fun has an actual name.

183
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,416
It's Sophie.

184
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,026
Both your kids are named...

185
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,620
She's Sophie.
The other one's Sophia.

186
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,728
It's different enough.

187
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,695
They actually have two completely
different derivations.

188
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,236
No, they don't.

189
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:58,535
I wasn't in a strong negotiating position.
Why is she here?

190
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,602
Ruby dropped her off.
Seemed pretty upset.

191
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,045
Apparently someone forgot
that it was Daddy's night.

192
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,549
She wasn't even gonna leave her

193
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,116
till I said that I was
letting you off early.

194
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:10,484
Damn it. I just started back on the team.
My schedule's a mess.

195
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,548
If your own kids
are a scheduling item,

196
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,283
maybe you should
let one of them move.

197
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,755
Patient has low platelets,
makes me think DIC.

198
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,056
She
doesn't seem to like that idea.

199
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,569
You're right. No
schistocytes in his smear.

200
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:28,771
He also has a low red count. What
if ifs a retroperitoneal bleed?

201
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:29,932
No Grey-Turner's sign.

202
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,806
She wasn't fussy like that
when I was holding her.

203
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,435
Maybe she likes
the sound of my voice.

204
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:38,677
Which is weird because I have
no genetic connection to her.

205
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,912
Could it be she
doesn't know the difference?

206
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,614
So many children of your own,

207
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:45,985
no wonder you have
such insight into

208
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,420
my relationship with my babies.

209
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,791
Good point. How could I comprehend
that you're too despised

210
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,352
to keep them from
having the same name,

211
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,523
too overwhelmed
to remember your own calendar,

212
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,259
and too vain to
admit that at this stage,

213
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:57,994
you don't matter
to either baby?

214
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,630
Low white count
suggests infection.

215
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,204
What if you're all right? Low
platelets, plus low red count,

216
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,539
plus low white count equals...

217
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,941
Aplastic anemia.

218
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,278
Kid needs a bone
marrow transplant.

219
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,276
Everyone except Adams transfuse

220
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,511
his platelets till
you find a match.

221
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:26,364
You started
college a semester late

222
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,399
because you left high
school a semester late

223
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:33,960
because you had five incompletes
in your junior year.

224
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,802
And you're
offering one bad semester

225
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,636
as proof that my
parents screwed me up?

226
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,973
Did okay before that,
straight A's after that.

227
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,876
I went through
a rebellious phase.

228
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:45,575
Don't tell me. Mom and Dad
were at each other's throats,

229
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:48,915
and the academic
crisis was a cry for help.

230
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:54,654
Sorry to mess with your world
view, but I'm not messed up.

231
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,523
So my parents couldn't
have messed me up.

232
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,222
Mom's HLA is only a 3/6 match.

233
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,358
Maternal grandmother's
worse than that.

234
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:04,766
Where'd you unload the baby?

235
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,234
Maternity ward. Shut up.

236
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:09,432
You realize you're making
House's argument for him.

237
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,736
The part where he said
any parent who uses day care

238
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,401
should ship their
child across the country?

239
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,712
No, the part where he said
that baby doesn't need you.

240
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,270
You've only got her
a couple days a week,

241
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,577
and most of that's spent with
a rotating cast of nurses...

242
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,618
That's how Daddy likes
to spend his time, too.

243
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,688
Shut up.
First cousin's also a whiff.

244
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:27,718
So much for genetics mattering.
I'll try the marrow registry.

245
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,720
Dr. Park is
searching the registry.

246
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,231
Transfusing his platelets will
keep him healthy while we wait.

247
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,461
You sure there's no one on the
father's side of the family?

248
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:40,037
If one of them's a match,
that'd speed things up a lot.

249
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,934
His parents died
young, he was an only child.

250
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,873
There's no living
relatives that I know of.

251
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,070
Something will turn up soon.

252
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,976
How soon is soon?
Will he miss a lot of school?

253
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,809
I'm actually thinking
of just getting my GED.

254
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,942
How do you expect
to get into a good college?

255
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:59,387
I'm gonna take classes on magic,
juggling, try to make a go of this.

256
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,119
Ben, you keep your grades up, you
can do anything in the world.

257
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:05,162
Like what? Work in
some boring office?

258
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,959
Do you think my father would
have done that for 10 minutes?

259
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,795
You don't remember your father.
You don't know...

260
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,392
I want to build
a connection with him.

261
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,337
Pass on some of
the joy that he gave me.

262
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,103
My...

263
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,337
My back hurts.

264
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,251
His BP's dropping.

265
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,913
<i>We think we've dealt with
all the liability issues.</i>

266
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,250
I'm in a meeting.

267
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:39,092
Sorry. Since you paged me I
didn't want to keep you waiting.

268
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,758
Yeah. I paged you,
which means you're next.

269
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,926
That's cool. I'll wait.

270
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,165
That's a good start Let's go
through it point by point.

271
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,331
First up...

272
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,373
I'll call you back.

273
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,608
Just got this.

274
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,483
The American Association
of Rheumatology

275
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:06,183
wants you to speak, 9:00,
Saturday, in Atlantic City.

276
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,016
Dr. Neusinger canceled on them
at the last minute.

277
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,557
I hate conferences.

278
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,695
Well, this is a big one.
And it's the premium slot.

279
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,996
I'd like you to do it.

280
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,628
I'll clear it with
your parole officer.

281
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,067
What do I need to do for you?

282
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,741
Halve the clinic hours
that you recently doubled,

283
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:33,579
and double the hooker budget
that you recently halved.

284
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,011
I think you refer
to it as petty cash.

285
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,583
Fine.

286
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,552
Just one thing. I'm gonna ask them
to put you on in the morning.

287
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,028
We're doing them a favor. Why
should you have to spend the night?

288
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,597
But you said that 9:00
was the premium slot.

289
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,568
I want to feel like
I've earned my hookers.

290
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,833
The place'll be a madhouse.

291
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,673
Especially since it's 2 miles from the
Rubio fight, at the exact same time.

292
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:05,881
Nice try. You called up, pretended
to be Neusinger, canceled,

293
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,417
then suggested
yourself as a replacement.

294
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,877
You go to that fight,
you go to prison.

295
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,613
Well, that'd be redundant

296
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:15,284
when I have an angry black guy waiting
for me to drop the soap right here.

297
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,294
Better go do some of those
clinic hours I recently doubled.

298
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,759
Test my urine.

299
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,697
Looks like I was
wrong about my diagnosis.

300
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,465
Yeah. I have diabetes.

301
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,601
No. But you're
not a hypochondriac.

302
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,144
Or you'd have imagined
some new disease

303
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,770
after I shot
down the first one.

304
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,274
So whose urine is that? Diabetic
girlfriend without health insurance?

305
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:44,219
It's not a scam, I'm sick.
Now I have swollen ankles.

306
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,223
The medical term is cankles.

307
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,115
Is there some black market in
insulin that I don't know about?

308
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,717
It's in my genes.

309
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:55,129
My old man got diabetes at 50, my older
brother got it at 50, I just turned 50.

310
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,895
Well, that's a great argument
if diabetes was a gold watch.

311
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:02,461
I've got sciatica like my dad,
class-four hemorrhoids like him.

312
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,405
I need to get
a jump on this thing.

313
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,902
We had to stop the transfusion.

314
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,140
Patient's having an allergic
reaction to donor platelets.

315
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,477
No one in Mom's
family's a match,

316
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,483
and as far as she knows,
Dad has no living relatives.

317
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,247
It's been years since he died.

318
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,363
If the kid's dad
died young of melanoma,

319
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,199
how come the overprotective mom

320
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,825
never took him to
a dermatologist?

321
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,164
Are you gonna test
my urine, or what?

322
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,214
Not diabetes.

323
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,854
Use crossmatched platelets,

324
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,288
try to find the patient some
blood that's closer to his own.

325
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,020
And get the real story
on clown senior's death.

326
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,857
Mom's hiding something.

327
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,953
There's a good bet
that it's medically relevant.

328
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,630
Apple juice. Easiest way to
fake a spike in blood sugar.

329
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:16,974
His family history of melanoma may
have affected his cellular outlook.

330
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,483
If we had more detail on the exact
type of melanoma his father had...

331
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:25,316
Otherwise we might not be able
to find a marrow match.

332
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,152
He never had melanoma.

333
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,057
How did he die?

334
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,262
He didn't.

335
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,667
He lives in Pennsauken, under a different name.
Mitchell Gordon.

336
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,174
How could you keep this from me?
From Ben?

337
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,674
He really needs to know his dad

338
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,509
just breezed in
and out of his life,

339
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,243
drunk and incoherent?

340
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,345
It's better to think
the man's dead but decent.

341
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,763
You realize I have to invite
someone else to the Rubio fight.

342
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,096
Nope. No
realization whatsoever.

343
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,102
You have a LoJack on your leg.

344
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,036
I was happy watching the fight
on pay-per-view.

345
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,870
You're the one who insisted
we go to Atlantic City.

346
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,986
Your biological father was a
decent, God-fearing minister,

347
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,152
the guy who raised you
was a cold-hearted jerk.

348
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,825
I'm trying to figure out
why you're so convinced

349
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,456
Adams has
parentally-inflicted damage.

350
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:43,898
You're trying to deflect.

351
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,399
Now you are.

352
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,802
You have to believe that every
parent screws up every child,

353
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,965
or you were screwed
out of a decent childhood.

354
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,441
My decent
daddy-of-the-cloth was also

355
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,944
being indecent
with my married mom.

356
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:59,409
He probably would've taken
other kids to the playground.

357
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:05,021
Not my fault, bad parenting.

358
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,861
Mitchell Gordon?

359
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,030
I've already got
a religion. Go away.

360
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,432
We're doctors.

361
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,362
Your son Ben is
in the hospital,

362
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,533
at Princeton-Plainsboro.
He's very sick.

363
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,272
Yeah, well, I don't
have a son. Not anymore.

364
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,281
We know there are
some issues there,

365
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,283
but your bone
marrow could cure him.

366
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,782
There's a hospital 2 miles from here.
It's a simple test...

367
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,721
You said he was at
Princeton-Plainsboro.

368
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,394
His mother feels it's better to do
the tests at a different hospital.

369
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,064
Like I said, I don't
have a son anymore.

370
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,863
House isn't gonna give up.
Just tell him about your parents.

371
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,304
Or make up a lie.

372
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,806
I don't want to lie.

373
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:02,036
And I don't want to validate
his ridiculous theory.

374
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,136
It's not ridiculous.
Even the best-intentioned

375
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,305
parents end up
damaging their kids.

376
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,908
You're a smart,
successful doctor.

377
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,578
How much damage could you have?

378
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,257
Know how I got
interested in medicine?

379
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,660
When my mother drank,
she couldn't handle me,

380
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,322
so she locked me in
my father's study.

381
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,332
Only so many hours you can cry
and bang on the door

382
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,370
before you give up,
find something to read.

383
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:32,339
We all have family dysfunction.
That's why we're successful.

384
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,502
To fill that hole.

385
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,517
My parents have a lot of money.

386
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,612
But they didn't
make it legally.

387
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:47,547
White-collar crime?

388
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,525
Started with card games,
high-stakes poker.

389
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,289
Then my dad got into narcotics.

390
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,525
At first just selling,

391
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,228
but then using, too.

392
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,702
Or he never would've gotten
into the slave trade.

393
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,537
Children mostly.

394
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:07,275
Easier to pack in small crates.

395
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,810
Plus the shipping's
a lot cheaper...

396
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,548
<i>Won't even trust a co-worker.</i>

397
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,712
<i>What did your
parents do to you?</i>

398
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,255
You have to go
see him yourself.

399
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,760
He wouldn't even come to
the door a second time.

400
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,563
Okay. I'll drive over there.

401
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,570
It's a pleural effusion.

402
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,908
He had a bleeding
problem earlier,

403
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,243
must be bleeding
into his lungs.

404
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,029
Except there's no blood.

405
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,295
What does that mean?

406
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,630
Means you don't have
to make that drive.

407
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,932
The problem isn't his marrow,
it's his liver.

408
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,273
Liver failure
explains everything.

409
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,114
Question is, what
explains the liver failure?

410
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:23,050
It's not an infection. We tried
antibiotics, but he's not responding.

411
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:26,351
More curiously,
what explains the mom lying

412
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,687
about Dad pushing
up squirting daisies?

413
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:32,388
This is how you plan
to get to that boxing game?

414
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,357
Why are you looking at her?

415
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,558
Because I'm stunned

416
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,136
and I have to
look at something.

417
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:45,499
Match, bout, fight,
contest, day, Helena.

418
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:50,073
Almost anything works after
boxing except the word game.

419
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:51,807
Your bigger
problem is the people

420
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,644
who design those
things aren't idiots.

421
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,177
Can you believe she
used to work in the can?

422
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,181
Nothing is tamper-proof.

423
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,415
It's a synthetic problem.

424
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,355
His liver's not
synthesizing proteins,

425
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,324
so fluid is leaking
out of his blood vessels.

426
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,861
And Mom's a selfish jerk.

427
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:07,828
She traded up,
married a lawyer,

428
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,864
wants to forget
the lowly circus clown.

429
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:11,332
You're defending the father

430
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:14,597
because you feel like a jerk for
baking buns in two different ovens.

431
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:17,003
You want lo believe
the mythical biological

432
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:20,109
connection excuses
being a man-slut... Ow!

433
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,179
I don't know why I'm starting
to doubt your expertise.

434
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,009
You do have a classified ad
and a piece of metal.

435
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,242
It's temperature that
sets it off, not force.

436
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,285
The rivets go pop, I slide in
the heating pad. Easy peasy.

437
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,582
More likely the patient
has a hyperammonemic problem.

438
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:33,247
His liver's not
cleaning out his blood,

439
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:34,915
the buildup of toxins
is causing everything.

440
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:36,789
I'm defending the dad
because he got screwed.

441
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,691
After he lost his son,
he lost his job,

442
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:40,626
been in and out of rehab,
gave up clowning.

443
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,892
Yes, as a parent, I empathize.

444
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,262
I say we tell the kid.

445
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,131
He's a minor,
the mom's his guardian,

446
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,033
and it's not even
medically relevant.

447
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,765
She robbed them of
12 years together.

448
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,399
Or she ripped off
the Band-Aid too late.

449
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,444
That memory she let
Son of Bozo establish

450
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,879
is making him chase his
father's moronic profession.

451
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:02,384
When he could be living the
high life in Portland.

452
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,388
And I mean that
metaphorically, of course.

453
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,423
This is where you dazzle me
with your contingency plan.

454
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:22,338
I see why employers
are reluctant to hire ex-cons.

455
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:27,737
Well, what about the patient?

456
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,580
Is the problem
hyperammonemic or synthetic?

457
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:31,773
Can't treat for both.

458
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:34,578
One requires hemodialysis,
the other a liver transplant

459
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,084
and we couldn't even get
the kid a marrow match.

460
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:38,348
Get the mom's consent
to pump him full of protein.

461
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:40,287
If it's a synthetic
problem, more fluid

462
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,255
will leak into his chest
and his heart will fail.

463
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,123
If it's hyperammonemic,
toxins will

464
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,990
overwhelm his body and
he'll go into a coma.

465
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:48,156
Do you only like tests that
involve the risk of death?

466
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:52,759
There are some slower, less conclusive
tests, but why take that risk?

467
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,276
In here.

468
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:11,277
Oh, my God. The water.

469
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:14,822
This is completely my fault.

470
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:19,558
There are very serious risks,

471
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:23,997
but if we don't figure out what he
has, we can't treat him at all.

472
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,834
I may be a little
out of bounds here,

473
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,377
but in case there
are complications,

474
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,471
might be a good time
to come clean to your son.

475
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,516
Lei his father visit.

476
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,144
A little out of bounds?

477
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:46,646
I don't know the history,
but everyone makes mistakes.

478
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:47,815
Your son worships him.

479
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:48,983
The doctor's right about that.

480
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:51,359
Yeah?

481
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,757
And when did he learn that?

482
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,694
When he encouraged Ben
to drop out of school?

483
00:25:56,989 --> 00:26:00,493
Mitchell is not Ben's father any more
than a sperm donor would've been.

484
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,543
Dr. House?

485
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:11,678
Unless you're a locksmith
or an electrician

486
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,579
with political
contacts, I'm busy.

487
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:17,279
My husband saw you in the clinic.
Wants treatment for diabetes.

488
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:19,686
My condolences
on your forthcoming divorce.

489
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,348
He keeps imagining symptoms,

490
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:25,452
and now I have to make him these
awful anti-diabetic meals.

491
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,929
Since I have no
intention of testing him,

492
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,465
treating him,
or cooking for him...

493
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:35,066
Could you write me a fake
prescription for insulin?

494
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:36,968
The advantage of
fake prescriptions

495
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,201
<i>is you don't have to be a
 real doctor to write one.</i>

496
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,744
Just tell me what's safe
to inject in his thigh.

497
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:47,244
His symptoms will go away and then
I can show him he was never sick.

498
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,113
Water?

499
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:51,050
Imaginary medicine's
not my specialty.

500
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,580
I do have
an imaginary colleague

501
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,783
who's just sent me
an imaginary page.

502
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,224
Imagine how sorry I am.

503
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,231
Still mad about what
happened in the lab?

504
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:10,671
I'm not mad,
I'm being professional.

505
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:14,971
You claim you're not screwed
up, you may even believe ii,

506
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,478
but House doesn't, and I don't.

507
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,980
So you can wait till he camps
out on your parents' lawn,

508
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,607
or you can admit you don't live

509
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,309
on some higher plane
and thank me later.

510
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,314
My... My eye feels weird.

511
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,420
What's happening to me?

512
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:37,766
You look tired.

513
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,770
I hate when people
say that. I know, I look bad.

514
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,998
I thought you were gonna
go to bed early last night.

515
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:46,941
Like an idiot, I went out with my
girlfriends to pretend I have a life.

516
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,808
When all I did
was flirt with guys

517
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:50,777
who'd have no
interest in a mom,

518
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,110
and miss the baby I couldn't
wait to get rid of,

519
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,015
and then get yelled at by my
mom for staying out too late.

520
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:56,518
You need your own place.
Yes.

521
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,612
I moved back home because it was
too drafty at the Four Seasons.

522
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,952
So go back to
work at the hospital.

523
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,686
Day care costs more
than what I earned as a nurse.

524
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,854
Have you considered
sub-standard day care?

525
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,225
Why don't you
stay here tonight?

526
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,398
No, I mean in the guest room.

527
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,067
I'll watch the baby again, you
can get a real night's sleep.

528
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:19,401
You'd do that?

529
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,483
Win-win.

530
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:33,648
Mommy gets a rest, Daddy gets
more time with his little angel.

531
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:38,651
There's some sweats in
the closet in the back.

532
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:47,401
Lucky girl, gets another
sleepover with Dada.

533
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,271
Makes a difference,

534
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,677
doesn't it?

535
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,357
Didn't answer
your page last night.

536
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:09,858
Sorry, battery died.

537
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:13,088
We got the patient's eye back in
place with steroid injections.

538
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:16,098
But a bulging eyeball means
it's not a liver problem.

539
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,930
And Mom's determination
to keep Dad away,

540
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:22,096
even as her kid gets sicker and
sicker, means she's got more to hide.

541
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,765
It's not diagnostically
relevant, let's let it drop.

542
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,935
You just lost my vote. You
ﬂip-flopped on parental rights.

543
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:29,569
I've been trying to
persuade the mother,

544
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,271
but ifs her son,
so it's her call.

545
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,610
Well, that's very
evolved of you.

546
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:36,379
You don't usually see Darwinian
changes over breakfast.

547
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,888
You made nice-nice with Phil.

548
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:44,219
You decided that he'd make a decent
father for Thing Two after all.

549
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,392
I had Sophie again last night,
and Ruby slept in my guest room.

550
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,432
Which has nothing
to do with Phil,

551
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,465
who will never be
a father to my children.

552
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,832
Angioneurotic edema
can cause rapid swelling.

553
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,996
Hey, we're having
a conversation here.

554
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,401
No abdominal pain.

555
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,669
So that must've
been nice having

556
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,970
Ruby and the baby
under one roof.

557
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:03,637
Yes, it was nice having
my daughter in my home.

558
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:06,306
That's why I would like her
sister to live near my home.

559
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:07,577
Anasarca?

560
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:08,911
Swelling would
have followed gravity.

561
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:12,319
Isn't that getting this whole
parenting thing ass backwards?

562
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:13,481
Aren't you
supposed to figure out

563
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,252
what you can sacrifice
to maximize their niceness?

564
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:19,329
And do you think I should sacrifice
myself from their lives?

565
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:24,265
Just one life. Until the other one's
mommy meets someone nicer than you.

566
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:25,926
Swelling that
fast and localized

567
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,661
has to come from
the lymph nodes.

568
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,534
Burkitt's lymphoma.

569
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:33,599
Swelling.

570
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,173
Cankles.

571
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:38,111
That's not a symptom of Burkitt's.
Are you saying...

572
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,515
It's Burkitt's.
Prep him for chemo.

573
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,622
I think you should give House
permission to go to Atlantic City.

574
00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:00,395
We'll stop by the rheumatology conference.
Everyone's covered.

575
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,131
No.

576
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,538
The guy has earned the right
to go to one boxing match.

577
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,371
He's done
everything you've asked.

578
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,468
Funded and staffed
his own department,

579
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,548
hasn't even broken as
much as a traffic law.

580
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,507
You're right.

581
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,243
So you'll let him go?

582
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,381
No.

583
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:21,321
I get why he wants to go to that fight.
I'd love to go myself.

584
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,552
Which is kind of why
I have to stop him.

585
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,552
My job is to be the jerk.

586
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,153
House has to believe that I
have authority over him.

587
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,496
He can't function
under someone's thumb.

588
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,660
I know. Which means
you can't go either.

589
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:39,504
Your job is to be his friend.

590
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:42,010
To stay here and sit with him and
watch the fight on pay-per-view

591
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,170
while bitching about me.

592
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,713
If we both do
our jobs, we might

593
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,281
actually get him
through his parole.

594
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,855
You're right.

595
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:58,593
Sorry to show up like this.

596
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,026
I was expecting
a battery of lawyers.

597
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:01,528
No lawyers.

598
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,100
Phil had something
that he would like to say.

599
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,465
So I thought that he
should say it in person.

600
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,035
It was wrong of
me to confront you

601
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:11,936
about taking
Rachel to Portland.

602
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:14,643
You don't want to
move to Portland?

603
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,211
Of course I do.

604
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,042
But this is about
your daughter, too,

605
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:21,379
and I'm not gonna do something
like this without your support.

606
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:26,720
So, you guys are trying to manipulate
me by playing good cop/good cop?

607
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:28,914
Is that how little
you think of me?

608
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,595
It's clear you're
back working for House.

609
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:36,256
I will see you this weekend
when you pick up Sophie.

610
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:37,658
Sophia.

611
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,227
We actually started
calling her Sophie.

612
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:40,428
Yeah.

613
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,465
Great.

614
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,605
It's cute.

615
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,276
Cankles.

616
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,444
Is there some problem with the
prescription you gave me'?

617
00:32:57,242 --> 00:33:01,281
I'm faint, I've been gaining more weight.
I think I need a bigger dose.

618
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:04,190
If you double his placebo,
he might drown.

619
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:08,428
Also, you forgot to mention
that your heart rate is slow.

620
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,499
My heart rate's not...

621
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:13,628
52?

622
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:15,262
The technical term is slow.

623
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:20,977
Those awful anti-diabetic meals you
eat, do they contain bok choy?

624
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:22,776
A pound of it. Every day.

625
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,179
Bok choy has glucosinolates,

626
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:29,616
which inhibit thyroid function and
account for all your symptoms.

627
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:33,145
So, this isn't diabetes?

628
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,815
You have a bad case of irony.

629
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:38,828
The food that you're eating to stop
making you sick is making you sick.

630
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:42,198
Maybe I don't have my father's
crummy genes after all.

631
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,062
On the other hand, maybe you're

632
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,032
fat enough to get
diabetes even without him.

633
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,208
I can't believe I have cancer.

634
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:57,143
We caught it early.
You should be okay.

635
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:01,375
I could die. I never went
anywhere, did anything.

636
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:05,978
If my father had lived, everything
would have been different.

637
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:10,725
Your mom and stepdad love you,
they've given you a great home.

638
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,991
That counts for a lot.

639
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,997
He's crashing,
everything's shutting down.

640
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,913
Renal failure, lung failure, heart
failure, all before we started chemo.

641
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:35,678
Burkitt's lymphoma is
fast-moving, but not this fast.

642
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:43,117
No rush. ICU stands for
"take your time" in Latin.

643
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,258
Multiple aneurysms.

644
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,524
That would mean every symptom
after his TIA was a coincidence.

645
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,190
Cholesterol emboli.

646
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,858
Bingo! Fits perfectly.

647
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,927
Check the file, confirm that we did
major abdominal surgery on him,

648
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,266
and then completely
forgot about it.

649
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:00,438
House.

650
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,545
Hello.

651
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,044
What the hell
are you doing here?

652
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,381
I was told this might be my
last chance to see my son.

653
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,383
You had no right This is
none of your business!

654
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,550
I didn't...
I called him.

655
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,292
This man is Ben's hero. Let them
spend five minutes together.

656
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,790
No. You get out of here!

657
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:31,799
Wait.

658
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:40,244
You sexually molested your son.

659
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,418
Your walk, tabes dorsalis.

660
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,852
You have late-stage syphilis.

661
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:49,756
Which you gave to our patient,
presumably 12 years ago.

662
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:53,261
Which also explains why Mom
is not big on family reunions.

663
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,433
I shouldn't be here.

664
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:09,340
We tested him for syphilis,
he was negative.

665
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:13,041
After 12 years, the active
infection would have died down

666
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,446
everywhere except
the arteries in his brain,

667
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,348
where it could hide
out from our tests.

668
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:21,447
When that six-year-old heckler
punched him in his juggling pins,

669
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,288
<i>it kicked up the dormant
bacteria in his pelvis.</i>

670
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:27,454
<i>The immunosuppressants we gave
him sent it into overdrive.</i>

671
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,023
<i>The antibiotics we gave him actually
started destroying the syphilis.</i>

672
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,398
<i>But like pouring
water on a fire,</i>

673
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,801
<i>led to a trail of
toxic smoke and ash,</i>

674
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:38,135
<i>which made his immune system
overcompensate.</i>

675
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,732
Severe Jarisch-Herxheimer
reaction.

676
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:42,968
- Is this true?
- Yes.

677
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:45,981
Jarisch-Herxheimer is real.
It sounds silly but...

678
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,978
You mean the... Right.

679
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,657
I found stains on his clothes.

680
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:04,395
He didn't understand and he
didn't seem traumatized.

681
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:09,729
I kept trying to talk to him, but
before long, he'd forgotten.

682
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:11,569
And he seemed...

683
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,010
He seemed happy,
and he seemed normal.

684
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,545
So you made Daddy
go away, and you made

685
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:18,170
sure Junior had no
reason to go looking.

686
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,516
I was just
trying to protect him,

687
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:26,682
like I should have
done from the start.

688
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,849
I'm sorry.

689
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:37,591
IV penicillin and anti-TNF
antibodies, he'll be fine.

690
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:40,465
Apart from the whole
daddy-rape thing.

691
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,207
We're not done.

692
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,941
No, we are not.

693
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:55,381
Notify the dad's sexual
partners, notify his employer,

694
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,453
his landlord,
notify the police.

695
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:01,046
I meant the kid. We're not gonna
tell him he was molested?

696
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,615
To make him miserable,
or to forfeit your license?

697
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,786
To tell him the truth.

698
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:08,296
He's a virgin, how do
I explain the STD?

699
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,299
It's a medical diagnosis. Screw the
parents, the kid's our patient.

700
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:15,303
I guess Taub's got a tough choice
to make when the kid wakes up.

701
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:16,599
Why is it my choice?

702
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:17,968
Because you're a dad.

703
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,406
How could the rest of us
possibly understand?

704
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,083
What was wrong with me?

705
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,920
It's called syphilis.

706
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:39,918
Uh...

707
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,662
You can get that
without having sex?

708
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,608
I didn't tell him.

709
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,677
Your heart said
he needed to know,

710
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:06,051
your brain knew he's
better off without it.

711
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,455
Following your heart is easy.
Following your brain is tough.

712
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:13,120
Especially after
years of following

713
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,355
that much smaller, third organ.

714
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:20,793
That's why all parents
screw up all children.

715
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:29,976
Evening.

716
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:38,985
Clever tactic, pretending
you're not interested anymore.

717
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:43,759
How could that
possibly work as a tactic?

718
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,224
The fact is, once I saw
those incompletes,

719
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:48,160
I knew your parents
screwed you up.

720
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:50,096
The details are just gravy.

721
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,658
You're wrong.

722
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:58,167
The only evidence you have
is proof of something else.

723
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:01,944
I ran away from home.

724
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,613
Because you had lousy parents.

725
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,685
Because I didn't.

726
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:16,420
All my friends' parents were
divorced, or having affairs,

727
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,358
or barely knew
their kids' birthdays.

728
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,528
You envied their dysfunction?

729
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,867
I thought it made
them deeper somehow.

730
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,539
It was stupid.

731
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,705
I hitchhiked to Manhattan,
moved in with an older guy.

732
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,546
In two months I
came running home.

733
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,382
Took my parents
years to get over it.

734
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:51,551
That's when you started to excel.
You were making it up to them.

735
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:56,392
Your parents screwed you up
by not screwing you up.

736
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:00,631
How does briefly wishing I was
screwed up make me screwed up?

737
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:06,068
It's normal to be screwed up. It's
really screwed up to romanticize it.

738
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,809
Guess that's why you wanted
to work with prisoners.

739
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,641
It's why I wanted
to work with you.

740
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,584
It was a tactic.

741
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,602
Chris.
Yeah.

742
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,612
I need to talk to you and Phil.

743
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,173
Is everything okay?

744
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:51,280
Yeah.

745
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,464
I can't let you move.

746
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,527
You drove all
the way out here just

747
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,295
to tell us what
you already told us?

748
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,636
I'm sorry.

749
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,153
House, open up I don't
want to miss the opening bell.

750
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:29,816
House?

751
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:44,235
<i>Telecast, and we expect
an electric atmosphere in the arena</i>

752
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:48,333
<i>and a sell-out crowd of about
10,000 for Rubio vs. Santos.</i>

753
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,413
<i>Two great fighters
with illustrious careers</i>

754
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,845
<i>might have been expected
to meet a long time ago.</i>

755
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,076
<i>As for Santos,
his handlers tell us</i>

756
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,744
<i>that he's done more roadwork
than at any time in his career,</i>

757
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:01,187
<i>hoping to prove tonight that
he can box for 12 full rounds.</i>

758
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:03,759
<i>Significant, because
Santos hasn't heard</i>

759
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:06,361
<i>the final bell in
more than six years.</i>

760
00:43:06,451 --> 00:43:08,590
<i>He comes in with 11
straight knockout wins.</i>

761
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:11,530
<i>He saw how a power-puncher
with a left hook</i>

762
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,865
<i>was able to cut
Rubio over the right eye</i>

763
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:16,301
<i>in the 10th round
of that last fight.</i>
