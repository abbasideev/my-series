1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:03,279
And you're sure he didn't
leave until after 9:00?

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,681
Absolutely. We watched the
Devils demolish the Rangers.

3
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:07,945
The game started
at 7:00.

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,110
Neither of you stepped
out between periods?

5
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,383
Get beer, pick up a pizza?

6
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,617
We stayed at my place, we
were together the whole time.

7
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,149
And you said the Devils won?
Yeah. Four-zip.

8
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,987
Kovalchuk had two, Arnott
and Parise each had one,

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,462
and Marty got the shutout.

10
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:22,460
I'm sorry? Marty?

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,894
Martin Brodeur,

12
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:27,472
Devils' starting goalie for,
like, the past 20 years.

13
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,131
He played awesome, as usual.

14
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:33,143
Your Honor, may I submit the sports
page from the New Jersey Chronicle

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,973
on October 9th, 2011'?

16
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,638
Objection. Relevance.

17
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,011
Goes to the witness'
credibility.

18
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,309
Go quickly.

19
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,586
Would you please read the
caption under the photo?

20
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:51,428
"Martin Brodeur
stops one of his 36 saves

21
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,589
"on the way
to a shutout victory."

22
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:55,822
That's what I just said.

23
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,602
That the defendant couldn't have
possibly committed the robbery

24
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,931
because he was with you,

25
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,563
watching Martin Brodeur
shut out the Rangers.

26
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:02,766
Yes.

27
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,274
Thank you.

28
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:09,041
Your Honor, may I submit the Chronicle
sports page from October 10th?

29
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,338
Your Honor... This is what
you call going quickly?

30
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,509
Just two more questions.
I promise.

31
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:20,355
Please read the highlighted
text at the bottom of the page.

32
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,518
"In Sunday's sports section,

33
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:26,689
"New Jersey Devils' goaltender,
Johan Hedberg, was..."

34
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,726
That's it. Keep going.

35
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,235
"...misidentified
as Martin Brodeur

36
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,538
"in a photo caption
and box score."

37
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,212
An understandable mistake

38
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:50,649
given that Martin Brodeur was
scheduled to start, but bowed out

39
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:54,389
after taking a shot to
the throat in warm-up.

40
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,223
Which brings me to
my most relevant question.

41
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,998
Did you and the defendant spend
the evening of October 8th

42
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,094
watching the Devils game on TV,

43
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,225
or did you just read about
the game in the Chronicle

44
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,896
while concocting
this false alibi?

45
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,940
I... l...

46
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,275
Excuse me, Your Honor,
may I approach?

47
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:18,508
You sure you don't want to wait

48
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,982
till after he answers
your question?

49
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,279
No.

50
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,751
I'm gonna need a continuance.

51
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:27,983
Now? You're one answer away from
destroying their whole defense.

52
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,253
Your Honor...
Oh, shut up.

53
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,351
You know it's true.

54
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,020
Let's finish this up.
I can't.

55
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:33,621
Why the hell not?

56
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,762
Because I think
I'm having a heart attack.

57
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,031
Great.
Call an ambulance.

58
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,406
Thinks he had a
heart attack, but didn't.

59
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:27,383
His EKG, cardiac enzymes and
catheterization are all normal.

60
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,852
Because it's an anxiety attack.

61
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,880
Probably because
he just turned 40

62
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,150
and still goes by
the name "Tommy."

63
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,383
It's not anxiety.

64
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,051
I had the ER docs
interview his wife,

65
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,594
she confirmed he's
been feeling fine.

66
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,357
Nothing out of the ordinary
at work or at home.

67
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:43,195
She probably also believes that he thinks
Salma Hayek's breasts are too big.

68
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,098
Which is why I had
them admit him anyway

69
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,365
and treat with alprazolam.
No improvements.

70
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,334
Because... Because
for some patients,

71
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:53,275
the diagnosis of anxiety disorder
can actually increase anxiety.

72
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,677
Which is also why I told him he
had a minor respiratory infection

73
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,943
that was easily curable
by the medication.

74
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,177
You lied?

75
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,120
I ruled out heart attack
and anxiety disorder.

76
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,013
Interesting.

77
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,050
I know.

78
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:14,722
<i>Impressive.</i>

79
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:20,637
What, the wiliness with which
Foreman ruled out anxiety,

80
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:25,301
or his complete wiliness-lessness
before he met me?

81
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:29,471
The fact that you managed to smear
jelly on nearly every page.

82
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,248
Shingles could cause chest
pain before a rash appeared.

83
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,815
Pain would be restricted to one
dermatome, not cross them.

84
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,718
Asthma induced
pneumothorax would,

85
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,050
and might not show up
on a posteroanterior x-ray.

86
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,285
No history of asthma.

87
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,383
They did
a lateral view as well.

88
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,396
No sign of pneumothorax
or deep sulcus sign.

89
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,329
I treated an inmate once
with similar symptoms

90
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,492
after he tried to poison his
cellmate with chlorine gas.

91
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,571
He didn't realize sharing a cell
also meant sharing the air?

92
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,162
Chlorine gas
pools near the ground.

93
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:56,400
He thought he'd be safe
in the top bunk.

94
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,669
But why would anyone
try to poison our guy?

95
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,301
He makes a living
sending people to prison.

96
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,176
But he's not in prison, and
it's kind of hard to gas a guy

97
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,840
unless you can seal him
in a room first.

98
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:09,409
Which is why Arceus created a
universe with three states of matter,

99
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,116
and 300 solid and liquid poisons
that could cause his symptoms.

100
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,452
Arceus?

101
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,692
Look it up.
And alkalinize his urine.

102
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,264
Then search his home,
talk to his wife.

103
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,162
See if you can get her to
tell us what she used.

104
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,701
Wait, why would you think
his wife poisoned him'?

105
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,796
Because dangerous people don't break
into your home, they live in it.

106
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,966
And although his kids are old
enough to want Daddy dead,

107
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,633
they're still too young
to do anything about it.

108
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,440
It must be such a pleasure
to live in your head.

109
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,313
You're right. The kids
might be precocious.

110
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,311
You handle his house. You
handle him and his wife.

111
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,114
They get to just
hang out and do nothing?

112
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,720
If you need help, you can
take whoever you want.

113
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,548
I'll take Taub.
I'll take Taub.

114
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,060
Interesting.

115
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,186
No, it's not.

116
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,061
It was a 50-50 choice. I'm
totally fine with Taub or Park.

117
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,828
Cool. I'll take Taub.

118
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:57,958
And I'll take Park.

119
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:02,865
That was fun.

120
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,540
Not really.

121
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,981
Nice move, boss.
Lying to the patient.

122
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,643
I had no choice.
I knew House wouldn't

123
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,551
take the case unless
I ruled out anxiety.

124
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:17,883
You need a girlfriend.

125
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,150
To keep me from
lying to patients?

126
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:20,884
To give you
the excitement you need

127
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,051
so you don't go looking for it.

128
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,491
You're not working
for House anymore.

129
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,063
Which means you no longer have
him to blame if you get caught.

130
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,154
I'm not looking for
excitement, I'm doing my job.

131
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:31,327
Part of which is to make
sure House does his.

132
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:33,569
Girlfriend might not be so bad.

133
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,833
It's less dangerous
than where you're headed,

134
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,840
and that's from a guy
with one alimony

135
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,401
and two child support payments.

136
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,356
It's this new
curve control thing.

137
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,085
It automatically slows the car

138
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,423
when it senses I'm
taking a curve too fast.

139
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,030
You really think
I care about your car,

140
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,794
or are you just trying
to avoid talking about

141
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,129
why you don't
like working with me?

142
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:05,962
There's nothing to talk about.

143
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:09,105
House liked poking ant hills
with a stick when he was a kid,

144
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,106
and now he wants to
do the same with us.

145
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,700
House is an ass,
but he's an intuitive ass.

146
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,302
He obviously noticed something.

147
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,706
Yeah' the fact that
we work well together.

148
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,447
He thrives on conflict and is
looking for someone to torment.

149
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,816
Don't let it be us.

150
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,049
I don't see how
that's possible.

151
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:32,130
Tommy's the most popular
guy in his office.

152
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,721
He's even had defendants thank
him after they were sentenced.

153
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,395
Why would they thank him?

154
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,968
Because he doesn't
treat them like scum.

155
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,732
He makes them feel like he's
helping by offering a plea,

156
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,400
or even just by letting them pay their
debt and clear their conscience.

157
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,442
And even if someone
wanted to poison him,

158
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:46,738
I don't see how
they would do it.

159
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,974
He never eats or drinks anything
that we haven't made at home.

160
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,483
Wail, you mean, literally, like,
not even a bottle of water?

161
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,643
No.

162
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,419
So, he was obviously
afraid of something.

163
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,319
Yeah.
Rats, mice, cockroaches.

164
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,983
My first job out of law school
was at the Health Department.

165
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,461
If you'd seen
some of the kitchens

166
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:06,929
and the processing
plants I have,

167
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,257
you'd cook all
your own food, too.

168
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,324
The poison wouldn't
have to be in food.

169
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,769
Have you gotten any strange
letters or packages recently?

170
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,864
No.

171
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,836
It also wouldn't
have had to be at work.

172
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,208
We've got two young kids.

173
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,872
There's definitely no poisons

174
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,506
I could've accidentally
been exposed to at home.

175
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,981
What if it wasn't an accident?

176
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,023
How are things between
you and your wife?

177
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:37,458
Are you asking me if I think
my wife is trying to kill me'?

178
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,329
Yes. I am.

179
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,966
Absolutely not.

180
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,129
This is coming from a man
whose eyes are wide open.

181
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,167
I've prosecuted hundreds
of despicable acts

182
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,867
by husbands, wives, parents.
I can assure you...

183
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,342
I love my husband.

184
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,881
And I would not ever,
even for a second,

185
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,813
consider doing anything
to hurt him.

186
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:04,186
No pesticides, fertilizers,
or fuel in the garage.

187
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,314
You find anything?

188
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,655
No. There's not even a bottle
of Wite-Out in this place.

189
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,853
Maybe we should look again.

190
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,758
Maybe we should leave
before the police get here.

191
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,389
Well, even if a neighbor saw
us break in and called 911,

192
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,566
unless they said we were
armed, it's low priority.

193
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:18,931
We've got another five minutes.

194
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,904
He's a prosecutor. Obviously
he knows a lot of cops.

195
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,908
His house is not
gonna be a low priority.

196
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,703
Good point.

197
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:29,570
Wait.

198
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:34,280
The dining room's on the
other side of that wall.

199
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,409
Yeah, so?

200
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,216
But it ends, like,
3 feet further over.

201
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,086
You gotta be kidding me.

202
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,524
A second ago, you
wanted to run like hell

203
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,688
and now you want to look
for secret passages?

204
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,762
There's a magnet
on the fridge they use

205
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,302
to open child proofed
cabinets. Go get it.

206
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,364
Hurry HP...

207
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,708
Here.

208
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,746
Holy crap.

209
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,630
Don't tell me.

210
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,799
The jealous wife,
in the dining room,

211
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:34,003
with bipyridyl herbicide.

212
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,907
<i>We didn't find any poisons.</i>

213
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,484
You obviously found something.

214
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:45,587
Yeah. A hidden bunker with
enough guns to defend Fort Knox.

215
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,420
Or break into it.

216
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,623
Cool.

217
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,591
That's impossible. You must've
broken into the wrong house.

218
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,930
Then you have creepy neighbors

219
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,096
because there were photos of
you and your kids all over.

220
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,941
I don't understand.
How could this...

221
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,340
I had it put in during
the remodel last year.

222
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,883
But we went over
the plans together.

223
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,481
It's not on the plans.

224
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,717
I didn't want the city
to know about it.

225
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,217
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:24,461
I should've told you.
I just...

227
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,293
I didn't want you
and the kids to worry.

228
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,457
About what?

229
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:34,061
Tommy, what is it? Why would you
think you needed so many guns'?

230
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:42,638
You're not gonna believe this.

231
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,180
He's worried that
"Too big to fail"

232
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,085
applies to our banks
but not our government.

233
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:52,579
How'd you know?

234
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,249
Because it's what
every idiot with a bunker

235
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,190
full of assault rifles
is scared of.

236
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,155
Heather Sweeney?

237
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,664
It'll just be a couple minutes
till someone's ready to see you.

238
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,395
Maybe it's not stupidity,
it's a symptom.

239
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,732
Cocaine abuse can cause
paranoia and chest pain.

240
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,671
This isn't necessarily paranoia.
Societies do fall apart.

241
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,601
Look what happened
with London in the riots.

242
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,906
There's a difference
between an isolated riot

243
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,503
and the fall of civilization.

244
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,276
April Donaldson?

245
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:20,710
Sorry, misspoke.

246
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,877
Imagine what would happen if
there was a terrorist attack

247
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,216
on the food supply,

248
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,915
or a pandemic where we had
to ration the antibiotics.

249
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,117
That's ridiculous.

250
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,582
Ouch.

251
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,856
Oh, shut up. We know what you're
trying to do and it's not gonna work.

252
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,066
It was a little harsh.

253
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,060
Stop being so...

254
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,363
What? Paranoid?

255
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,564
You're gonna look pretty foolish
if that was a wrong guess.

256
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,435
I think you're a good
person and a fine doctor,

257
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,770
but it's ridiculous
to think anyone needs

258
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,105
an arsenal of assault weapons.

259
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,907
He's obviously paranoid.
What about Fahr's disease?

260
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,809
He's not hallucinating.
As far as we know.

261
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,746
We should do a mental
status examination

262
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,148
and get a CT of
his basal ganglia.

263
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,117
No, we shouldn't.
If it's not poison,

264
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,620
it's most likely
atrial fibrillation

265
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,554
brought on by hyperthyroidism
or sleep apnea.

266
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,227
Looks like we got ourselves a
good old fashioned cat fight.

267
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,320
No, we don't. We have a
reasoned disagreement.

268
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,422
Still, there's only
one way to settle this.

269
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,499
Actually, there's two,
but we don't have

270
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,161
enough Jell-O
for the first.

271
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:16,103
Mini-mental, CT,
and get a hair sample

272
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,732
to check for past cocaine use.

273
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,776
Check his TSH levels
and get a sleep study.

274
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,341
Sorry, gotta make it
a fair fight,

275
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:23,675
which means
you're stuck with her.

276
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,113
He's not stuck with me.

277
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:26,742
And it's not a fight.

278
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,511
Excuse me, miss.

279
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,749
What is your name?

280
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,256
Mariel Wilkerson.

281
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,252
Hah.

282
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,756
You don't look like a Mariel.
You're up.

283
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,309
<i>So what do you think? ls the
patient paranoid or am I?</i>

284
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:00,145
I don't think stockpiling weapons
is the most reasoned response,

285
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:03,152
but given what I've seen at
Bloomingdales on Black Friday,

286
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,813
I wouldn't say it rises to
the level of mental illness.

287
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,283
And me?

288
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,156
Again, given what I've
seen at Bloomingdales...

289
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,565
Don't let House get to you.

290
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,158
It's all of you. I feel
like you don't respect me.

291
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,860
Chase certainly
didn't try to hide it.

292
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:20,994
Chase respects you.

293
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,367
He's just more comfortable
working with me

294
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:23,634
because he's known me longer.

295
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,334
And I'm not just saying that
because you own a gun.

296
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:26,806
I don't own a gun.

297
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,677
I've thought about it,
but I'd probably

298
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,306
end up shooting someone
in my own family.

299
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,511
Like, when my brother tosses his
toenail clippings behind the couch.

300
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,812
What about you?

301
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,414
If anarchy breaks out

302
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:43,892
I plan to do what my ancestors have
done throughout the ages, run.

303
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,190
Sounds like a good plan.

304
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,354
You got a moment?

305
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,230
Stop telling the nurses I'm
looking for a girlfriend.

306
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:54,937
What makes you...
Two lunch offers

307
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,064
and a box of cupcakes
since this morning.

308
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:00,076
So a few people are nice to you
and your first thought is,

309
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,509
"Hmm. This seems strange."

310
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,742
I haven't even had time
to eat my own lunch,

311
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,778
much less run around trying
to recruit nurses for yours.

312
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,409
So can I get back to work?

313
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:13,350
You're lying, aren't you?

314
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,419
It's for his own good.

315
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,287
He's not paranoid,
he's just stupid.

316
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,694
Well, shouldn't you put
yourself in that group?

317
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,389
You own a gun.

318
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,601
Our patient doesn't own a
gun, he owns an arsenal.

319
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,937
And I don't own a gun.

320
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,205
Yes, you do.
And you're a felon.

321
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,403
So. you'll end up
back in jail...

322
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:37,447
That is actually not one of the many
reasons that I don't own a gun.

323
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,585
Why would I need a gun? The only
thing I own worth protecting,

324
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,448
a thief would need a crane
to get out of my apartment.

325
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,386
You don't own
anything you need.

326
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:46,717
You own things you want.

327
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,781
And you're definitely the
type who'd want a gun.

328
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,087
You like anything dangerous.

329
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,829
Monster trucks,
motorcycles, fireworks.

330
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,398
Everyone loves fireworks.

331
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,898
Watching them, not making them.

332
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,934
I'm telling the truth.

333
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,066
I stand corrected.

334
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:06,175
If you believe me, then
this issue will be resolved

335
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,074
with no further
action necessary.

336
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,742
Absolutely.

337
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,479
It's not resolved, is it?

338
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,741
Not even close.

339
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,922
It's not cocaine.
Hair samples were clean.

340
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,651
It's not looking good
for Fahr's either.

341
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,350
I'm not seeing
any calcifications.

342
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,518
You sure?

343
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:26,495
They can be pretty hard to
detect in people under 50.

344
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:27,656
See?

345
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:28,788
What?

346
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,594
We all disagree all the time.

347
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,099
It's not just me and Park.

348
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,834
Nice try, but I'm not
getting in the middle.

349
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,265
So why didn't you want to
go with her this morning?

350
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,333
She's weird.

351
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,844
She's not weird.
She's a good doctor.

352
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,608
Most good doctors are weird.
Look at House.

353
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,511
Am I weird?

354
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:49,143
Yeah, but you're hot, so
it's easier to put up with.

355
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,124
You're completely normal
and a pleasure to deal with.

356
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,120
You're weird.

357
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:58,784
In a good way?

358
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,693
Maybe we should just
concentrate on the medicine.

359
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,294
You own any guns?

360
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,461
That's not medicine.

361
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,627
But it's related
to medicine. Kind of.

362
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,335
What do you think?

363
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,232
Yeah.
But not for protection.

364
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,206
Despite what the media
would have us believe,

365
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,008
you think we live
in a very safe world.

366
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,639
You just think they're fun.

367
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:21,876
How did you know?

368
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,009
Working in a prison,
you learned

369
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,850
criminals rarely
target random strangers,

370
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,686
and you've got more money than
you know what to do with,

371
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,852
so anything that seems different
and fun is worth trying.

372
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,188
And you?

373
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,096
Not here in the States. Back home,
I keep a few for hunting 'mos.

374
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,698
You hunt kangaroos?

375
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:39,595
But they're so cute.

376
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:41,669
They're also delicious.

377
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,031
You're screwing with me.

378
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,002
Totally.

379
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,238
There's no calcification.

380
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,941
Looks like we're both wrong.

381
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,045
You don't need to stay.

382
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,846
We won't have the results
until the morning.

383
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:56,945
It's okay. I'll stay.

384
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:02,682
Go. I'm sure your mother's
ready for a break by now.

385
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,222
Give the kids a kiss for me.

386
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,393
You think it's the end of the
world, but you wanted kids.

387
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,758
Oh, honey, come on.

388
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,862
I don't think the world's
coming to an end.

389
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,268
Look.

390
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,940
You have a spare tire
in your car, right?

391
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,945
That's what those guns are.

392
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,386
I mean, I hope to God
I never have to use one.

393
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,480
But if we can wake up

394
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:37,386
and learn that the entire banking
system has gone bankrupt overnight,

395
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,226
it just seems stupid not to
have a jack in the trunk.

396
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,662
Just in case.

397
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,395
And you've always...

398
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,732
What's that from?

399
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,928
I don't know.

400
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:50,664
You don't feel that?

401
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:51,764
No.

402
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,775
He also spiked a fever overnight.
Could be TB.

403
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,179
You wanna say it?
Say what?

404
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,312
There's no sign of atelectasis or
infiltrates on the chest x-ray.

405
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,584
Yeah. That's med-speak
for, "She's an idiot."

406
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,988
Systemic sclerosis can
cause lower extremity ulcers.

407
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,789
It would have to
be pretty far along.

408
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,489
His first symptom was
just a few days ago.

409
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,496
His paranoia started
at least a year ago.

410
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:16,860
If he's paranoid.

411
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,331
So it's either not sclerosis,

412
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,269
or it's extremely
aggressive sclerosis.

413
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,104
We should biopsy the skin lesion
and start him on enoxaparin.

414
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,701
Shouldn't we wait for the biopsy
results before we start treatment?

415
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,207
Now's your chance. She's
leading with her chin.

416
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,442
I agree with her.

417
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,511
No, you don't.

418
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,515
Which means you're both idiots.

419
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,056
Get to work.

420
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,191
I know you don't
think I'm an idiot.

421
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,522
Does it matter?

422
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:53,331
If you're just looking to amuse
yourself at my expense, then no.

423
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,497
But if you feel the need
to manipulate me

424
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,666
to make me useful, then yes.

425
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,070
I thought we'd
gotten past that.

426
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,736
If we hadn't gotten past
that, you wouldn't be here.

427
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:06,010
But ability isn't always enough.
Just ask Yngwie Malmsteen.

428
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,515
So this is you
trying to help me?

429
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:11,248
No, this is me helping me, and
amusing myself at your expense.

430
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,323
Which brings us back to,
why do you care'?

431
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,858
I deserve respect.
I'm a good doctor.

432
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,727
People respect you.

433
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:19,922
They just don't like you.

434
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,564
Where's your wife?

435
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,434
She just needed some time.

436
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,899
Not a fan of the guns,
I take it.

437
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:36,002
It's not the guns, it's...

438
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,940
I shouldn't have lied about it.

439
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,917
I'm guessing it's
a little of both.

440
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,715
And a little of "Who
the hell is this guy?"

441
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,854
I'm not a nutcase.

442
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,961
I just want to do everything
I can to protect my family.

443
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,530
Don't worry,
I'm sure she understands.

444
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,195
<i>At first I though!
It might be frostbite.</i>

445
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,539
But I haven't really
been out in the cold.

446
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,870
And yet your first
thought was frostbite?

447
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,246
Yeah. I guess I was just
going by how it looks.

448
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,919
It looks absolutely
nothing like frostbite.

449
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,280
You serious?

450
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,386
With some difficulty.

451
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,116
Then what is it?

452
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,887
A sign that you need
to take a long vacation.

453
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,490
At least a month.

454
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,619
A vacation?

455
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,725
<i>Wait, is this like
a Bucket List thing?</i>

456
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,458
It's cancer?

457
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:33,798
It's silver.

458
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:36,499
I'm guessing silver nitrate
mixed with petroleum jelly

459
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,268
that your boss put
on the petty cash

460
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,901
so he'd know who to have
arrested for stealing it.

461
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:44,739
Damn.

462
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,007
Yeah. Damn.

463
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,653
It's diffused into your skin.

464
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:53,189
The only way to get rid
of it is to get new skin.

465
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,489
<i>That normally happens
every 30 days, so...</i>

466
00:21:58,184 --> 00:21:59,959
I hear that La Crosse,
Wisconsin

467
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,295
has got the world's
largest beer can.

468
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:07,598
Here's the per diem schedules.

469
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,264
These are supposed to
be in a computer file.

470
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,207
Sorry, since Claudine left, no
one's been inputting the numbers.

471
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:13,868
I miss Claudine.

472
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,843
She left because of you.

473
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:16,879
I thought that was Nadine.

474
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:17,970
Her, too.

475
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,176
Where are you going? You
still have an hour left.

476
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:22,718
Emergency page
takes precedence.

477
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:25,451
Can you... I don't know
how to use the program.

478
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,185
Then find someone who does.
I gotta get out of here.

479
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:40,061
Got your page.

480
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,362
You're an ass!

481
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,672
Admit it.

482
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,367
Let me down.

483
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,844
After you admit it.

484
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:55,381
I'm a little tired.
I think I'm gonna go...

485
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,044
All right, I admit it.

486
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,886
Despite the fact that I
know there's a gun in here,

487
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:03,926
I'd never find it because
you are more devious...

488
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,893
Clever.
Devious.

489
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:09,064
All right.
Fine, clever.

490
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:12,692
More clever, and you'll always
be one step ahead of me.

491
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:33,414
You're either
preparing to fight Pacquiao,

492
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,049
or you're having
one heck of a bad day.

493
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:37,951
I'm Anita.

494
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:41,391
Eric. Nice to meet you.

495
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:44,690
And you can tell Taub

496
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,067
that he's gonna get the same
treatment as this heavy bag

497
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,434
if he doesn't
cut this crap out.

498
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:49,631
Who's Taub?

499
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,539
You know, I'm sure
you're a nice person,

500
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,476
and you have no idea what
you've gotten sucked into,

501
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,945
but really, I'm not interested.

502
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,115
Okay, and I'm sure
you're a nice person,

503
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,981
but I just moved from Atlanta,

504
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,383
and this is my first
time at this gym,

505
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,219
so I definitely don't know
who this Taub guy is.

506
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,782
But I already agree.
He's a jerk.

507
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,995
Are you sure you don't
want to start over?

508
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,894
Take your time.
I'll be around.

509
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,171
Taub, it's Foreman.

510
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,339
<i>Can't talk now.
Little busy.</i>

511
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:32,472
What's going on?

512
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:37,477
Need some droperidol in here!

513
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,953
<i>L gotta go...</i>

514
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,852
He was hallucinating he was
being attacked by bears.

515
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,521
Points again to paranoia.

516
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,792
I agree,
except for the "again."

517
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,766
Acute onset points
to tularemia.

518
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,699
Or it's been chronic, which
points to GAD autoimmunity.

519
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:55,999
Explains
the neurological impairment,

520
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,267
as well as
the normal blood work.

521
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,275
Tularemia doesn't always show
up in the blood work either.

522
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,504
You know what else doesn't
show up in the blood work?

523
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,178
Nothing. This could
all be psychiatric.

524
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,839
An untreated schizoid disorder,

525
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,781
he's finally lost
the ability to suppress.

526
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,320
Schizophrenia doesn't cause
skin ulcers or fevers.

527
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:12,515
No, but digging delusions
out of your skin

528
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,318
with dirty fingernails
could cause both.

529
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,859
I don't think
he's a psych case.

530
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,550
Because you're
paranoid about paranoia.

531
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:21,529
Because his symptoms point toward an
infection that's spread to his brain.

532
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,395
I think we should treat with
high dose broad spectrum...

533
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:26,663
Which will kill him
if it's a GAD autoimmunity.

534
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,032
Treat for GAD.

535
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,241
Corticosteroids and
IV immunoglobulin.

536
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:46,354
I'm not paranoid. And
they don't dislike me.

537
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:48,255
They don't even really know me.

538
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,519
Did they tell you that?

539
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,721
I didn't ask because you
wouldn't believe the answer.

540
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:54,764
If it makes you feel
better to think that.

541
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,060
You're the one
everyone dislikes.

542
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:58,566
You probably don't
even think it's GAD.

543
00:25:58,657 --> 00:25:59,658
You're just agreeing with her

544
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,501
because you think it'll create
more conflict between us.

545
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,598
There's only one way
to find out.

546
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:08,007
Actually, there's two, but we're still
waiting for that Jell-O delivery.

547
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,104
Let me know how it goes.

548
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:05,800
Gotcha!

549
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,332
You poor dumb bastard.

550
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:01,616
Touché.

551
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,503
God, this is
exactly what I needed.

552
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:22,477
Tell me about it.

553
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,480
Nita?
Oh, my God.

554
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,541
Who's that, your roommate?

555
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:30,642
No. It's just...
You have to go.

556
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,744
Why, what's the big deal?

557
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,151
Please, I'm...
I'll explain later.

558
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,089
Just hurry up, please.

559
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,215
You have a boyfriend?

560
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:37,658
No' he's not my boyfriend.

561
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:42,055
He's my husband.
I'm really sorry.

562
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:49,531
Hey, I thought you weren't
getting back till tomorrow.

563
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:57,778
His fever's going
through the roof,

564
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,507
which means we were
wrong about GAD,

565
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,278
and the steroids kicked the
infection into high gear.

566
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:03,512
Or it is GAD and we started
treatment too late.

567
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,952
Increase the steroid dose.

568
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,044
We can't.

569
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,886
If it's an infection,
we'll kill him for sure.

570
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:12,088
<i>With neurological symptoms progressing
this fast, he's dead either way.</i>

571
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:15,455
If we increase the steroids,
either death comes slower,

572
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:18,797
which means we were too late with
the GAD, or death comes faster,

573
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,268
which means we were too
stupid with the infection.

574
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,464
We were already stupid with
infection, but it's not too late.

575
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,042
He's young and was perfectly
healthy two days ago.

576
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,606
He can fight this off,
if we give him a chance.

577
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:37,915
Fine, but a shotgun is not gonna work.
We need a sniper rifle.

578
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,920
<i>Start running DNA assays
for sporotrichosis,</i>

579
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:44,586
<i>meningococcemia, and any other
Boggle-winning words you can think of.</i>

580
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,129
You just said you wanted
to increase the steroids.

581
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:47,219
Now you wanna just...

582
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,959
I changed my mind.

583
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,158
<i>But...
Do what Park says.</i>

584
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:02,746
Well, you don't have a gun.

585
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,475
But you do have my sunglasses,

586
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,982
my tennis racket,
I can't imagine why...

587
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,915
Had to kill a mouse.

588
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,319
It's really hard with those
stupid little sunglasses.

589
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:14,853
And my money clip.

590
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,016
Was there any money in it?

591
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,149
Not anymore.

592
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:21,127
Can I go to bed now, or do you
want to do a cavity search?

593
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,830
Lock up on your way out.

594
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:25,664
This is ridiculous.

595
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,668
Every moment we waste looking
for a phantom infection

596
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:28,794
is time we could
be treating him.

597
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,000
For the wrong diagnosis. If it was
GAD, he'd be having seizures.

598
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:33,303
And if it was infection,

599
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,367
there would be some sign
of it in his blood or CNS,

600
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,208
which there isn't.
Yet.

601
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,680
I'm beginning to think we should
just go with House's idea.

602
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:41,341
This was House's idea.
He said...

603
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,283
No, I'm talking
about the Jell-O.

604
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,288
At least it wouldn't
be so annoying to watch.

605
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,623
Taub.
You got a minute?

606
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,519
You're an ass.
You know that?

607
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:57,462
What's the problem? Some cute,
young nurse baked you cookies?

608
00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:59,634
No. Some guy almost
caught me making out

609
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,897
with his wife
in their living room.

610
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,331
And how exactly
is that my fault?

611
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:05,534
If you hadn't
been screwing with me

612
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,631
and put the idea in my head...

613
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,304
So you don't date anyone unless
I put the idea in your head.

614
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,006
You really do need
psychiatric help.

615
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:13,883
Unlike you, I don't need drama.

616
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:16,475
I like my job and
I'm happy with my life.

617
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,082
You're so happy with your life

618
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,678
you've got nothing
better to do at midnight

619
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:21,691
than to come back
into work to yell at me?

620
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,222
Stay out of my business.

621
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,030
You're blaming the wrong guy.

622
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,671
Good for him.

623
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:40,566
Married one's not a
keeper, but it's a start.

624
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,038
You're an idiot.

625
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,348
He has stridor
but no obstruction.

626
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:55,958
He's anaphylaxing.
Get me a trach kit.

627
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:02,888
Scalpel.

628
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,383
It's not working. There's no breath sounds.
Doesn't make any sense.

629
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,925
His trachea's blocked
below the incision point.

630
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,993
- We need racemic epinephrine.
- We tried that already.

631
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,392
We're gonna try again.
It's our only choice.

632
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,927
We got him breathing,
but barely.

633
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,405
At least we know tracheal edema
isn't from anything we did.

634
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:46,909
Because we're
not doing anything.

635
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,741
Which is a good thing because neither
GAD nor a systemic infection

636
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,077
would cause anaphylaxis
or tracheal edema.

637
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,080
And an allergic
reaction wouldn't get worse

638
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,584
three days after
he was admitted.

639
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:58,683
So we got nothing.

640
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:01,658
Unless he was
still being poisoned.

641
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:02,781
By who?

642
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:04,589
His wife wasn't even here
when he hallucinated.

643
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:07,821
Good question.

644
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,031
Now we're the ones
being paranoid.

645
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,500
What about
squamous cell carcinoma?

646
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:16,466
If it's only in his epithelium,

647
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:18,337
it wouldn't show up
on his chest x-ray.

648
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,370
It is possible, but...

649
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:21,705
Wouldn't cause hallucinations.

650
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,144
It could if he also had
paraneoplastic syndrome.

651
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:30,444
Get a biopsy.

652
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:32,114
You think it's cancer?

653
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,387
I think you should
get a biopsy.

654
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,462
Admit it.

655
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:55,209
Two hours ago, I found
this in your closet

656
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,973
in a box with your name on it.

657
00:33:57,302 --> 00:34:00,044
I knew you'd move it somewhere
outside your apartment

658
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,812
until you were certain
I'd given up looking.

659
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,321
So, I had to convince you
that I'd given up looking.

660
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,017
It's not a gun.

661
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:15,157
Yes. It's a paperweight

662
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,393
with a handy
storage compartment

663
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,559
for .45-caliber bullets.

664
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,729
And that's not a bullet.
Admit it.

665
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,236
I'm more clever and more devious.
You can even have it back.

666
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,911
It's not my problem if
you go back to prison.

667
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,072
My problem is you thinking you're
always one step ahead of me.

668
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,582
This proves nothing,
because it's not a gun.

669
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,241
It's a prop.

670
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,450
From Dorothy Dietrich's
magic act.

671
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,912
Look it up.

672
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,753
She's the only woman ever to
do the catch a bullet trick.

673
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:46,452
I won this off her prop
master in a poker game.

674
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,360
House...
It's fake.

675
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,356
It's plugged.

676
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:54,960
Look for yourself.

677
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,062
Hey! Hey! Don't point
that thing at me.

678
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,108
It's not dangerous
because it's not a gun.

679
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:00,934
House...
House, just stop it.

680
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,543
Fine.

681
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:09,382
What the hell are you doing?

682
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,283
Pull the trigger.
Don't be insane.

683
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:12,548
They're blanks.

684
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,056
You pull the trigger,

685
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,116
I drool a little fake blood,
and I spit out the bullet

686
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,785
that the audience thinks
I caught with my teeth.

687
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,328
Go ahead. Shoot me.

688
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,323
I'm not shooting you.

689
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:23,891
All right.
I'll shoot you.

690
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,263
Don't! House, don't!

691
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,666
Even if they are blanks,
people will freak.

692
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,665
It's not real.

693
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,640
Which means you didn't
prove that I have a gun,

694
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,146
which means
you've proved nothing.

695
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:42,808
Admit it.

696
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:51,758
Admit it.

697
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,990
All right.

698
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,258
All right' what?

699
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,160
You win.

700
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,600
And it feels good.

701
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,801
You were wrong.

702
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,366
Don't feel too bad,
we all were.

703
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,468
His trachea wasn't
swollen, it was blocked.

704
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,741
By a psuedomembrane
growing across it.

705
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:50,484
Means he's not paranoid, is
an idiot, and was poisoned.

706
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:53,478
What are you doing?

707
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,149
Give me a Machida scope.

708
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:58,260
Hold his legs,
he's not gonna like this.

709
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:02,890
Because you're not
gonna be able to breathe.

710
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,929
But I need to see
down your barrel.

711
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,175
Good news is,

712
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,236
the poison didn't
come from your wife.

713
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,745
It came from a little
bastard of a bacterium

714
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:20,612
whose crap can
cause chest pain,

715
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,015
respiratory distress,
skin ulcers,

716
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:26,087
the growth of pseudomembrane
across the airway,

717
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:30,523
and in very rare cases,
hallucinations.

718
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:42,027
Call the CDC. Tell them we need
antitoxin as soon as possible.

719
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,128
Diphtheria?

720
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,932
We didn't guess it
because nobody gets it.

721
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,943
Instead of building bunkers, you
should be getting boosters.

722
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:53,447
As in the routine vaccines against
stuff that is actually scary.

723
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,399
Diphtheria?

724
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,500
House pulled it out of nowhere.

725
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:16,966
Cool.

726
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:20,137
You just getting in?

727
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:23,804
I had a meeting about a new
parking validation system.

728
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,243
Cool.

729
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,075
How are you feeling?

730
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:31,785
Not great.

731
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:35,916
But better.

732
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:43,163
The antitoxin is working. He'll
be able to go home in a few days.

733
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,961
That's good news.

734
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,098
But we've moved out.

735
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:50,796
Oh, come on, honey.

736
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,131
I'm sorry I lied, but...

737
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:54,199
I know. Okay...

738
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:57,943
It was for our own good,
but I don't care.

739
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:00,710
I don't want to be lied to,
and I can't live like that.

740
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,785
And I can't live in that home.

741
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,790
Oh, please, don't.

742
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:08,949
I love you.

743
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,058
I love you too,

744
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:16,564
which is why you're not
gonna live there either.

745
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,501
I don't care if
we might need them.

746
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:23,838
I just know that I can't live
my life feeling like we do.

747
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:26,135
It's not worth living in fear.

748
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:32,141
Okay. I'm sorry.

749
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,155
Hey.

750
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,156
Thanks.

751
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,606
You know, there's a bunch of us
going to happy hour after work.

752
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:02,444
I'm craving nachos.
You interested?

753
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:05,379
Thanks, but I got a lot of
work I need to get done.

754
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,882
Sure. Well, if you change your
mind, we'll be at Rudy's.

755
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:10,675
Okay.

756
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:24,756
Hey.

757
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,358
- Hey.
- Hey.

758
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:37,543
Would you like to get a
drink sometime after work?

759
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:41,380
You mean all of us?
Or just us?

760
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,045
I was thinking
just the two of us.

761
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:46,949
Did Taub put you up to this?

762
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:48,149
No.

763
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:50,658
It was just something I'd been
thinking about and I figured,

764
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,388
"What the heck'?
Might as well ask."

765
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,926
Yeah, well, it's probably
not a good idea,

766
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:00,230
you know, with us
working together.

767
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:04,336
Didn't you marry someone
you used to work with?

768
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:06,238
Yeah, but...

769
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:11,240
All right, sure.
When?

770
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,578
Tonight?
Sure.

771
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,873
Hey, I changed my mind.

772
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:45,973
Okay.

773
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:46,670
Glad you changed your mind.

774
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,238
Hey.
