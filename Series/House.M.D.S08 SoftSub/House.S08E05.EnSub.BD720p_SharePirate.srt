00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,297
<i>Good afternoon, Cedarville!</i>

2
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:29,140
<i>It is my distinct
honor to present</i>

3
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:32,176
<i>our annual
community service award</i>

4
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,803
<i>to one of our most
outstanding citizens.</i>

5
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:39,984
<i>Now, many of you may
recognize him as Coach Bob</i>

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,986
<i>of our champion
Little League team.</i>

7
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,521
<i>And some of you may know him</i>

8
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:47,319
<i>as the treasurer of
our Harvest Scholarship Fund.</i>

9
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:50,719
<i>But I know that all of you
know him as the guy</i>

10
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,854
<i>that owns the only
gas station in town.</i>

11
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:58,902
<i>Bob Harris, get on up here with
that beautiful family of yours.</i>

12
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,000
<i>Bob Harris, folks!</i>

13
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:08,506
<i>Bob, your community activism,
charity work</i>

14
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:12,717
<i>and character represent the
finest Cedarville has to offer.</i>

15
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,844
<i>Please accept this
on behalf of all of us</i>

16
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,114
<i>and know that we love you.</i>

17
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:49,779
Are you all right?

18
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,579
Bob?

19
00:01:58,652 --> 00:01:59,960
You're crushing me.

20
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,463
Wake up!

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,733
I think you're having a heart attack.
I'm gonna call the ambulance.

22
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,171
No. Just drive me
to the hospital.

23
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,279
As the new Dean of Medicine,
I'd like to personally welcome

24
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,784
all of our new
employees and ask

25
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,114
why the hell do you
want to come back?

26
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:58,885
Tired of surfing.

27
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,515
He hasn't changed.

28
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:04,323
And neither has the job, right?
We still get to do crazy crap'?

29
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,022
Save people's lives instead
of just their noses?

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,498
About that,
about the crazy stuff...

31
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,866
Here we go. He's gone
from ally to enemy.

32
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,528
He has no choice.

33
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,368
He's the boss now.

34
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,497
He has to be professional.

35
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,009
Has to base his decisions on what's
best for the entire hospital.

36
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,171
We can't take it personally.

37
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,474
Couldn't have said
it better myself.

38
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:23,637
You did.

39
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,509
I'm just reading
the notes on your desk.

40
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,643
He also wants us
to spy for him.

41
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,148
Not spy. I'm trying to
keep House out of prison.

42
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,351
To do that, I need to know
what he's doing and planning.

43
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,483
SPY-
SPY...

44
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,564
Come on, guys.

45
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,997
Look, I am your boss, you do
have to treat me appropriately,

46
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,331
but it doesn't have to
be awkward and weird.

47
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,601
Outside of work, I still
consider us all friends.

48
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,605
I'm glad you feel that way,
because I do have a favor to ask.

49
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,671
I told House I couldn't
come back until next week.

50
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:55,042
He said he understood completely
and that I was fired, so...

51
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,047
Since I have my kids for the next
two days, I need a babysitter.

52
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:05,913
No.

53
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,795
<i>Male patient went into V-fib, but
shows no signs of heart disease</i>

54
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:16,390
or any other
symptoms for that matter.

55
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:19,800
What was he doing when his
heart decided to do the mambo?

56
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,873
He said he was at work.

57
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:29,737
You're late.

58
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:30,907
According to my calendar,
I'm a week early.

59
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,542
Beard's a nice touch.

60
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:36,315
Lets everyone know that
you're not a teenage girl.

61
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,988
Now, you two
make a cute couple.

62
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,083
And you two...

63
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,424
It's not important.

64
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,628
Dr. Park.

65
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:53,170
You're a lot taller
than I thought you'd be.

66
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,898
And I look forward to
working with you, as well.

67
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,407
He's lying. Not just
Taub, the patient.

68
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:01,241
These abrasions on his knees,
they're minty fresh.

69
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,575
They're about 10 hours old.

70
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,979
He got them playing
flag football.

71
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,482
He said he got them
playing flag football.

72
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,110
I'm sure that's true, if flag
is a euphemism for "penis"

73
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,483
and football is a euphemism
for "entering a vagina".

74
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,755
Why lie about it?
Everybody lies.

75
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,491
Speaking of which,
how are your two baby girls?

76
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,927
Wow, twins. Congratulations.

77
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,129
Awkward.

78
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,930
He knocked up two different
women at the same time.

79
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,266
At least he thinks he did. Did
you have the DNA tested yet?

80
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,430
Why would I?
They look just like me.

81
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,597
But they will grow.

82
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,434
Find out what else
he's lying about.

83
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,771
Do an exercise test,
see if you can

84
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,105
get him to go back
into V-fib again.

85
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,544
But we could end up causing
another cardiac arrest.

86
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,810
Hopefully, then we'll
know what set it off.

87
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,943
He means, it's better to do it
here where we can revive him

88
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,452
than have it
happen somewhere else.

89
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,548
The prodigal son has returned.

90
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:48,888
Now if you'll
excuse me, I have to go

91
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,825
slaughter a fatted
calf for lunch.

92
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,827
I told you, I was sitting at my
desk when the attack happened.

93
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:00,969
These rug burns
are from last night.

94
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,804
We think you were having sex, but
memory loss could also be a symptom.

95
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,009
Maybe we should ask your wife?

96
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,144
Don't.

97
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:15,880
I did something stupid last night,
but it was a one-time thing.

98
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,479
You have no idea how
bad I feel about it.

99
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,714
Your guilt is
between you and your wife,

100
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,552
we just need to
know what happened.

101
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,159
I was having sex at a motel

102
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,993
when I started to
feel light-headed.

103
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,161
Next thing I knew,
I was lying on my back,

104
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,403
I could barely breathe.

105
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,568
Is everything all right?

106
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,336
We'd like to
perform an exercise test.

107
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,904
Recreate the stress that may
have caused his symptoms.

108
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,879
He was sitting at his desk.

109
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,211
It's his heart
we're worried about.

110
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,842
The test will
monitor its rhythm

111
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,510
so we can check for
any abnormalities.

112
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,022
I spent a month in solitary. You don't
think I can keep this up all day?

113
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:10,034
I have a headache. Could
you just lower your voice?

114
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,134
Chase and Taub are back!

115
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,439
You want me to pick
up an ice cream cake?

116
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,210
I also think that Taub

117
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,412
has brought his little Taubettes
into work with him today.

118
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,577
And why would he do that?

119
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,314
Because I didn't give him time
to do anything else.

120
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,482
So then I started wondering,

121
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,219
"Who'd be sappy enough
to watch them for him?"

122
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,627
They're not here.

123
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,893
What?

124
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,593
I just came for
a chat with a friend.

125
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,332
What's that I smell, friend?

126
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,737
I understand your confusion.

127
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,073
I was eating
a baby for lunch and...

128
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,444
I have a massive migraine.

129
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,249
Will you, please, just go away?

130
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,420
You should probably
lie down to rest.

131
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,988
Yeah, I was trying to.

132
00:07:58,912 --> 00:07:59,913
Oh...

133
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,021
There is one more thing.

134
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,467
He's in too good of shape.

135
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,772
We need to get him to the
point he was at last night.

136
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:23,609
Don't look at me,
but if you want to.

137
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,808
Cute,

138
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,015
but I didn't mean
physical stress.

139
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,711
Don't you guys think
this is irresponsible?

140
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,348
It's like you getting two women
pregnant at the same time.

141
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,690
I just mean the part about
the odds of it happening.

142
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:38,956
They had to be incredibly high.

143
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,295
And if we induce V-fib,

144
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,058
odds say that we'll
be able to revive him

145
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,793
but there's always
a chance we can't.

146
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:49,204
It's extreme and reckless. That's House.
You get used to it.

147
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,365
Or I fire you.

148
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,376
Look what I found.

149
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,075
Kiddie-winkies.
I wonder who they belong to.

150
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,475
Give me my kids.

151
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,707
No, I genuinely
wonder who they belong to.

152
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:01,911
I need a DNA sample.

153
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,386
I'm not letting
you DNA test my kids.

154
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,650
I already did.
This swab's for you.

155
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,687
Fine, if you don't
mind paying a fortune

156
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,924
in child support for
some other guy's kids?

157
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,864
No skin cells off my cheek.

158
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,665
His heart rate's
finally elevating.

159
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,370
Dr. Chase said you had
something to tell me?

160
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,840
We were talking about how you got
the abrasions on your knees.

161
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,734
The flag football game?

162
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:28,835
Oh, um...

163
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,277
Yeah, honey, I'm gonna need
you to let the guys know

164
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,351
I'm not gonna be able
to play on Saturday.

165
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,613
The whole town knows
that you're in the hospital.

166
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,846
I wouldn't worry about it.

167
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,183
That's not what you
wanted to tell her.

168
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,249
You said
the game wasn't typical.

169
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,690
Something happened
that you were upset about.

170
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,730
I don't understand.
What are you...

171
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,197
I don't...
I don't feel very...

172
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,266
What's happening?

173
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,404
It's not his heart.
I know.

174
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,037
<i>He's having a seizure.</i>

175
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,060
There wasn't any
abnormal electrical activity

176
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,396
in his EKG when
the seizure occurred.

177
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,960
It wasn't caused by V-fib.

178
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,130
We still can't rule it out.

179
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,071
His EKG from the E.R.
documented it.

180
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,642
Myocarditis?

181
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,472
Viral infection
weakening the wall muscles.

182
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,136
We'd need to biopsy
his heart to confirm.

183
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,579
Myocarditis
wouldn't cause a seizure.

184
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,310
Could be genetic.
Brugada syndrome?

185
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,682
Oh, my God.

186
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:47,291
Two prodigal sons.
Come on, let's hug it out.

187
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,858
You really like
the idea or you just

188
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,484
wanna grab some
hair for a DNA test?

189
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,789
It's a stupid idea.

190
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,161
We would have seen evidence
of Brugada in the EKG.

191
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,756
You know, this is...

192
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,769
It's just messing with my feng shui here.
What about over there?

193
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,833
A pheochromocytoma?

194
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:07,537
Excess adrenaline can cause
heart problems and seizures.

195
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,044
Boring.
I'm sorry.

196
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,979
I thought I was here to treat the
patients, not entertain you.

197
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,210
Would it hurt to do both?

198
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,351
This is much better.

199
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,557
I said it was boring,
I didn't say it was wrong.

200
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:22,683
So I'm right?

201
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,192
Nope, you're wrong.
Photic epilepsy.

202
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,822
It's equally boring, but it has the
advantage of possibly being right.

203
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,127
Give him an EEG to confirm.

204
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,977
If you ever hear me mention
anything about wanting kids,

205
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,542
please feel free to
punch me in the liver.

206
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,052
Why?

207
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,519
Like Satan's alarm clock.

208
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:58,919
What's House up to?

209
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,190
He hasn't asked
me for anything,

210
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,492
he's been
incredibly well behaved,

211
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:02,896
he's doing his clinic hours.

212
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,366
That is a sign of concern.

213
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,730
You know him as well as I do.

214
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,827
He needs to constantly
establish he's the alpha dog.

215
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,033
He's got his team back,
he's got his office back,

216
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,269
he's got everything he needs.

217
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,377
You really believe that?
He's content?

218
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,179
I don't want to let House sabotage
himself by sabotaging me.

219
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,277
And I need your guidance
and your trust to do that.

220
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,582
No, no, no.

221
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,679
Cuddy had a problem with
House, she came to me.

222
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,852
Wanted to vent' me.
How did that turn out?

223
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:34,591
You have a problem with House, deal
with it, or find someone else who can.

224
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:42,438
We're sorry about earlier, but
we needed to provoke a reaction.

225
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,529
It worked.

226
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,032
I can barely look her
in the eyes anymore.

227
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,046
I'd want my husband
to tell me the truth.

228
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,103
Sure.

229
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,947
You'll feel better,
and she'll feel what?

230
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,450
Devastated,
betrayed, heartbroken.

231
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,747
You really want
to do that to her?

232
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,948
No.

233
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,286
But I can't live like this.

234
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,285
But she can.

235
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,485
All set.

236
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,460
All right, we need you to
sit back and try to relax.

237
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,801
Just look at the light.

238
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,905
What exactly are they
building back there?

239
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,316
A dream.
The EEG didn't show

240
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,977
any abnormal brain activity.

241
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,349
He doesn't have
photic epilepsy.

242
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,423
I know, because he has
a pheochromocytoma.

243
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,479
You said I was wrong.

244
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,684
You were wrong not to
rule out epilepsy first.

245
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,261
That only takes
a couple of hours.

246
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,296
Finding a tumor that's flushing
adrenaline through his system

247
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,489
is gonna take all night.

248
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:41,792
Monitor his brain activity,

249
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,425
start a continuous urine test and
blood draws every two hours.

250
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,028
I can't, I have my kids. Wilson':
Leaving in, like, 15 minutes.

251
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,128
Chase and Adams
can do the tests.

252
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,297
Thank you.

253
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,949
For the massage bed.

254
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,952
You and Park are checking the
motel he was bumping uglies at

255
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,817
for environmental factors.

256
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,198
He couldn't find
a babysitter. Get over it.

257
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,736
You're gonna get us killed.

258
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,499
She thinks I'm
a prostitute on her turf.

259
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,334
Showing weakness is
what gets you killed.

260
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:24,806
Why would she think
you're a prostitute?

261
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,969
I'm in a dump with a guy
almost twice my age.

262
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,136
What else is she gonna think?

263
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,137
How old do you think I am?

264
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,090
So who cheated on you?

265
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,391
We just met.

266
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:54,027
Don't you think it's a little early
to be dragging up our baggage

267
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,004
in front of each other?

268
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,042
Who says I have baggage?

269
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,708
I know when House went to
prison, you quit medicine.

270
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,407
You don't do that, unless...

271
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,175
I didn't quit,
I took a vacation.

272
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,115
I knew when he got out,
I'd get my job back.

273
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:11,188
House didn't even
know he was coming back.

274
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:12,546
I had faith.

275
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,456
Now that has baggage
stamped all over it.

276
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,590
Seizure activity?

277
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,224
No, one of
the sensors came loose.

278
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,735
I'll fix it.

279
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,371
<i>What is it?</i>

280
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,246
Not a pheochromocytoma.

281
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,451
<i>Our patient now has
a mass in his neck</i>

282
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,924
and his body temp's been rising
over the last three hours.

283
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,392
Where's the construction crew?

284
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,056
Well, I'm not gonna make
them work day and night.

285
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,597
So I chose night.

286
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,800
And his urine and blood tests
didn't show any evidence

287
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,801
of an adrenaline
secreting tumor.

288
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,896
Meningitis? We can do
a lumbar puncture to confirm.

289
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,771
Sorry, I had to drop my kids
off at day care across town.

290
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,400
What'd I miss?
It's not meningitis.

291
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,277
His neck isn't stiff and his
mental status is normal.

292
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,781
He's only guessing.

293
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,280
I'm talking to Taub.

294
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,411
He can't say "my kids"
until he lets me test him.

295
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,154
So tell me about the love shack
where he cheated on his bride.

296
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:21,816
The quarters came in handy.

297
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,588
My kids loved the massage bed.

298
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:29,994
Lab tests show the bed tested
positive for, uh, semen,

299
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,593
vaginal secretions,
saliva and fecal matter,

300
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,935
both human and animal.

301
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,436
You probably want
to boil the kids

302
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,771
for a couple of
hours when you get home.

303
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,812
The bathroom also
tested positive for

304
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,845
five different types
of pathogenic bacteria.

305
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,109
Fusobacterium necrophorum
was one of them.

306
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,674
Yeah. How did you know?

307
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,877
The bulge in his neck.

308
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,685
The bacteria colonized
his parapharyngeal space,

309
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,055
moved into his jugular vein
causing a thrombus.

310
00:16:56,549 --> 00:17:00,122
Lemierre's Syndrome. Treat with
amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.

311
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,857
Dig out the clot before it moves
to his lungs and kills him.

312
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,758
You got at least
a trillion cells.

313
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,829
You're gonna misplace
one of them eventually.

314
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,991
I have to tell
my wife the truth.

315
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,238
There's plenty of time for
that after the operation.

316
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,864
What if I die? And one day she
finds out I cheated on her.

317
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,740
I'll never be able lo explain.
Never tell her how sorry I am.

318
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,676
You're increasing the odds of
that every second we waste here.

319
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,909
No, I'm not agreeing to
anything until I talk to her.

320
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,917
Daddy!

321
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,610
Hey!

322
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,221
Hey, guys.

323
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:04,055
Ew! Your neck looks
really gross.

324
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,757
I missed you both so much, but
I need to ask you a favor.

325
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,096
I need to talk to
Mommy alone for a second.

326
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,726
Would you mind
watching them for us?

327
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,200
Um...

328
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,115
This guy's an idiot.

329
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,549
I think he actually
has a good point.

330
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,788
What would you think
if you found out, years later,

331
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,322
your beloved dead
wife cheated on you?

332
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:34,547
I wouldn't believe it.

333
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,596
As long as I don't
hear it directly from her,

334
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:43,226
then loan hang on to
hope that it's not true.

335
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,391
But this way,

336
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,068
she has to either
dump him or forgive him.

337
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,468
Guys, get your stuff.
We're leaving.

338
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,413
I'm so sorry.

339
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,175
I'll be back.

340
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,117
I'm gonna drop our
kids off at my mother's.

341
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:11,019
Look, he made a mistake.
A stupid, horrible mistake.

342
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:13,656
But we'll get through this.

343
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,927
All I care about right now is
that my husband gets better.

344
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:26,666
Sorry about yesterday.

345
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:30,674
<i>House was like Child Catcher
from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.</i>

346
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,148
Why is he so obsessed with
my kids being my kids?

347
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,053
Because he sees insecurity,

348
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,350
and when House senses
weakness, he pounces.

349
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,049
And because his
insecurity is the fact

350
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,818
that other
people can have faith

351
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,827
and don't have the obsessive
need for physical proof.

352
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,795
Also, he started a betting pool

353
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,631
on which kid is yours and which isn't.

354
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:05,308
An entire hospital betting on
the legitimacy of my kids.

355
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,710
It's great to be
back among friends.

356
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:32,336
I'm not the bad guy here.

357
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,344
I'm betting on
them both being yours.

358
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,883
I would have donated
the money to charity.

359
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,785
Approaching the clot,
stand by for...

360
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,056
That's not a clot.

361
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,390
It's his lymph nodes.

362
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,633
The bulge wasn't caused by pus or blood.
It's tissue inﬂammation.

363
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,967
How could there be that much...
Lymphoma.

364
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,865
We need to take a biopsy.

365
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,081
- Did I nick something?
- I don't know.

366
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:16,552
I don't see any
bleeding in here.

367
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,552
His sclera is jaundiced.
I think it's his liver.

368
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,226
It's failing.

369
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:32,399
We did a major operation for no reason.
It's not Lemierre's Syndrome.

370
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,667
We would have had to biopsy his lymph
nodes anyway to check for cancer.

371
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,002
Which it's not,
biopsy was clean.

372
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:40,577
We could be dealing with an
alcoholic going through withdrawal.

373
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,614
Explains his heart,
seizures and liver failing.

374
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,650
But not his
swollen lymph nodes.

375
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,446
Why are we stealing
cable from here?

376
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,281
We don't even have
a TV in our office.

377
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:53,915
I'm an ex-con trying to adjust
to a world that's passed me by.

378
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,118
Stealing's all I know.

379
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:58,685
And the fact that I was right about
what's wrong with our patient,

380
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,764
just wrong about what.

381
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,962
He means it's not Lemierre's,
but it's still an infection,

382
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,435
which is why it's
spreading so rapidly.

383
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,596
Cultures take time and his
liver doesn't have much left.

384
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,107
That's why we're
gonna blast him

385
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:12,642
with broad-spectrum
antibiotics.

386
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:16,339
The blast will fry what's left of his liver.
The cure will kill him.

387
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:17,971
Not if we get him
a liver transplant first

388
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,639
and then treat him
with the broad-spectrum.

389
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,842
And old team for the win.

390
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,285
Not that I'm keeping score.

391
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,189
It's more of a grid where I assign
numerical values that determine

392
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,353
who gets raises, vacation
time and my respect.

393
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,635
We have him on the donor list for a
liver, but these things take time.

394
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,298
So he could die
before he gets one?

395
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,170
It's a possibility,
but we have another option.

396
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,973
We can do a partial liver
transplant from a living donor.

397
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,407
- I'll do it.
- If you're a match,

398
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,243
but to increase our odds,
we'd like to

399
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,146
get your friends and
family tested, as well.

400
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,352
Is it safe?

401
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,253
It's a major surgery.

402
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,983
Donor spends
a week in the hospital

403
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,991
and up to three months
convalescing at home.

404
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,993
I can't ask someone
to do that for me.

405
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,189
There are hundreds of people
who would do that for you.

406
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,529
Because they don't
know the real me.

407
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:13,031
You are a good man
who made a mistake.

408
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,007
Then I have to tell them first.

409
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,403
I have to live with this, too.

410
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:27,515
I know. And I'm sorry,

411
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:31,043
but this is the only
way that I can do this.

412
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:15,294
Before I ask any of you to sacrifice
three months of your life for me,

413
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,457
I have a confession.

414
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,598
I had an affair.

415
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,270
I cheated on Denise.

416
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,272
I wouldn't blame
anyone if you decide...

417
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:29,677
I forgive him.

418
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,115
That should be
enough for all of us.

419
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,015
Thank you so much
for coming here...

420
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,949
There's more.

421
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:46,492
Larry, that new transmission
I put in your truck,

422
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:47,928
you didn't need it.

423
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,494
Joe, same thing with
the engine rebuild.

424
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,870
In fact, I cheated
most of you here tonight.

425
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,270
Half the time you bring
your cars into my garage,

426
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,780
there's nothing
wrong with them.

427
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,613
I've been ripping
you all off for years.

428
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:15,149
I also took $10,000 from
the Harvest Scholarship Fund

429
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:17,952
and I lost it gambling.

430
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,329
I'm sorry.

431
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:24,961
I'm not the man
you thought I was.

432
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,478
That went over well.

433
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,915
Out of the two donors
who didn't walk out,

434
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,318
both were negative
for a potential match.

435
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,084
Telling the truth may have
just killed this guy.

436
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,715
I told him to tell
his wife he cheated,

437
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:50,760
not confess every sin
he's ever committed.

438
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,494
If everybody did that, we'd never
find a donor for anyone again.

439
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,725
Everybody doesn't lie, cheat
or steal from their friends.

440
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,164
Yeah, they do.

441
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,900
Maybe not as much as this guy,

442
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,164
but if people told
nothing but the truth,

443
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,830
the world would probably
burn down over night.

444
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,771
Some people think
it's burning now.

445
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,867
Maybe if
everybody didn't lie...

446
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,073
Aww, that is cute.

447
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,107
I'm talking about your breasts.

448
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:17,276
They always get perky when
you're being painfully earnest.

449
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,078
Truth.

450
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,785
It's uncomfortable, isn't it?

451
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:24,926
More truth, I only noticed because
Chase was staring at them.

452
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:27,755
He'd never admit it because he
doesn't want to offend you.

453
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:29,127
Same reason he'd never tell you

454
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,562
that he's thought
about having sex with you.

455
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,363
Although, to be fair,
every man you've ever met

456
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,301
has thought about
having sex with you.

457
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:36,703
They'll lie,
because if you knew,

458
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,968
you probably wouldn't want
to have sex with them.

459
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:42,136
And that's just some of the
lies from the last minute.

460
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:44,605
And here's a bigger one.

461
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:45,807
You already know this,

462
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,745
but you pretend you don't because
it makes you feel civilized.

463
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,249
Most people find it
easier to ignore the truth.

464
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:53,718
Ask Taub.

465
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,124
Our patient can't wait for a
transplant that's never gonna come.

466
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:00,094
We need to get
reckless and extreme.

467
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,063
CT his liver, find the
damaged area and cut it out.

468
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:05,499
Hopefully what's
left will be enough

469
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:08,401
so we can start treatment with
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

470
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:17,070
I'm sorry the first time I had both
of you together, I had to work.

471
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,183
But Daddy's boss is
what we call a jackass.

472
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:30,753
It's okay. Stay right there.

473
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,328
I'm also sorry

474
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,594
for what I'm about to do

475
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:46,801
because nothing will ever change
how I feel about you guys.

476
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,953
But Daddy is weak
and needs to know.

477
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:09,187
Okay. I'm just gonna
put this right here, okay?

478
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,207
It's 3:30 in the morning.

479
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:24,303
Why are you still here?

480
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,643
House is here.

481
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:26,977
And apparently
prepping for an operation

482
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:28,379
that will
probably kill a patient.

483
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,475
I wouldn't be doing this if I
thought there was another way.

484
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,317
There is.
He needs a transplant.

485
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,550
You have one lying around?

486
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,751
'Cause he'll be dead if he doesn't
get one in the next few hours.

487
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:38,923
That falls under
natural causes.

488
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,394
If you kill him,
we're looking at...

489
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,555
Dead is dead.

490
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,257
Not as far as our
lawyers are concerned.

491
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:46,494
I'm not being a dick.

492
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,097
This is a real issue and I have to
worry about the big picture now.

493
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:51,196
I don't.

494
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,040
I'll be doing what you would
have done a year ago.

495
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,908
I'll be in surgery.

496
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,406
Chase? You need to
check this out.

497
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:05,878
This is his CT scan of his
liver from 10 hours ago.

498
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,349
This is from now.

499
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:10,584
It's healing itself?

500
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,534
When I left the room,
he was telling her about

501
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,070
the strippers from
his bachelor party.

502
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,233
Liver function
has improved 30%.

503
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:28,039
It buys us a few extra days
before he'll need a transplant.

504
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,637
Interesting question is,
"Why is it regenerating?"

505
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:41,448
And scene.

506
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:44,550
Now we're back to
boring reality, reality.

507
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,459
His liver was in shock before.

508
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,157
He's been having an allergic
reaction since he got here.

509
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,131
It would explain why his
symptoms appeared so rapidly.

510
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,327
And maybe it's
starting to go away.

511
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,426
We need to run a scratch test
to find out what set it off.

512
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:55,972
Or who.

513
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:57,904
This all started when
he cheated on his wife.

514
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,735
He's allergic to a person?

515
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,109
Or something she's wearing.

516
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:05,943
Makeup, perfume,
birth control method.

517
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:07,975
Her Hello Kitty doll.

518
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,350
Two of you go find
her and find out what.

519
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,615
Two of you start treatment with
corticosteroids and epinephrine

520
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,746
while you run the scratch test.

521
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,928
You think I did this to him?

522
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,592
Or something you wear,
own, use or gave him.

523
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,162
I gave him a condom.
He didn't have one.

524
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:27,259
What kind?

525
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,805
I don't know what kind. I got it
from a health fair I was working at.

526
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:30,999
You're in
the medical profession?

527
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,599
I'm Miss Cedarville, the health
fair is one of my responsibilities.

528
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:37,112
Is another one hooking up with
38-year-old married men?

529
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,515
I guess I'm supposed
to be the good cop.

530
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,844
I know this is tough,

531
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,389
but anything you can remember
might help save his life.

532
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:55,160
He was giving me a ride home
and he always seemed so nice.

533
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,791
And then we ended
up at the motel.

534
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,798
Now everybody's
talking about it,

535
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,233
and if they find out it was me,

536
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,308
I'm gonna lose my
title and probably my job,

537
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:08,640
and no one in town is ever
gonna speak to me again.

538
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,677
I made a mistake and now it's
gonna end up ruining my life.

539
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:16,650
Denise never
wants to see me again.

540
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,881
What did you think
was going to happen?

541
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,748
I was sick of living a lie.

542
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:26,261
Everybody loved me,
everybody looked up to me,

543
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,694
but I didn't deserve it.

544
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,822
Everybody makes mistakes.

545
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,233
They just don't usually broadcast
all of them at the same time.

546
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:37,170
Well, if I'm gonna die, I might
as well do it with a clean soul.

547
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,833
And if you live?

548
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:40,738
You didn't just burn bridges.

549
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,608
You torched, nuked and
salted the earth with them.

550
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,572
Everybody has to
pay for their sins.

551
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,014
It feels like you
stuck me with a hot poker.

552
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,414
An allergic reaction.

553
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:54,184
It's the swab for
wheat-based allergies.

554
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,954
I've been eating wheat my entire life.
I'm not allergic to wheat...

555
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,528
Now it feels like my
whole body's on fire.

556
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:04,095
This doesn't make any sense.

557
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:05,600
He broke out with
a rash right after

558
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,203
<i>I tested with
the wheat allergy swab,</i>

559
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,899
but none of his blood samples
shows he's allergic to it.

560
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,201
Then he's not allergic to it.

561
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:14,106
Could the corticosteroids
have somehow caused it?

562
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,303
I didn't hook them up yet.

563
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,107
After he broke out,
I wanted to confirm

564
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,943
it was gluten
before we dosed him.

565
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,616
Could be a latex allergy.

566
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,048
It started with
a condom and we've kept it

567
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,550
going with our
gloves and equipment.

568
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,882
He doesn't test
positive for that either.

569
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,887
None of his samples
test positive for anything.

570
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,457
Then he's allergic to something

571
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,059
not on the tests.
I'll keep looking here.

572
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,459
We'll start the steroids
and see if it clears up.

573
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,102
You have one patient
and three DNA results?

574
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,149
How else do I compare him
to other genetic disorders?

575
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:54,342
What's up?

576
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,441
Chase basically
called me a sellout.

577
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:58,486
Just because you
hung up your lab coat

578
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,521
for more money
and a bigger office?

579
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:03,991
I hung it up because someone had to
run this place after Cuddy left.

580
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,119
There are a lot of good
administrators out there,

581
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:07,286
not many good doctors.

582
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:08,690
More to it than you think.

583
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,767
For example, you're
looking at monkey DNA.

584
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:17,796
My analysis,

585
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:21,138
House took your results after he
manipulated you into providing them.

586
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,967
He's shedding his
skin like a snake.

587
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,333
If it was an allergic reaction,

588
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,632
the corticosteroids
and epinephrine

589
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,731
would have made
him better, not worse.

590
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,413
Is everyone trying
to think of an answer?

591
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:01,576
Or is everyone afraid to say
what they think the answer is?

592
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,817
I take it you're in
the latter category.

593
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:08,090
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.

594
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,393
It fits all of his
symptoms and explains

595
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,495
why he got worse
after the steroids.

596
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:15,224
Most medication
exacerbates the condition.

597
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,822
There's no treatment for it.

598
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,830
It fits.

599
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:25,833
Case closed.

600
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,340
You should go home
and get some sleep.

601
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,416
I feel like I'm in hell.

602
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:20,492
We can't give you too
much pain medication

603
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,428
or we'll make
your condition worse.

604
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,107
I got one final
confession to make.

605
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:33,668
What's left?

606
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:35,910
You cheated on your taxes?

607
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:37,911
I'm a murderer.

608
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,848
I killed my business partner.

609
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,421
I shot him in the head

610
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,358
and made it look like suicide.

611
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,826
And he was just the first

612
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,663
You killed more?

613
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,097
Three.

614
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,038
Or four.

615
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:14,109
Try not to kill anyone
else until I get back.

616
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:20,645
It's neurological.

617
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:24,192
There's an aneurysm in the anterior
communicating artery of his brain.

618
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:27,126
The area moderating impulse
control and compulsion.

619
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,394
As it grew larger,
so did the confessions.

620
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,831
Watch.

621
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,662
Bob, one of my shoes is
missing from my locker.

622
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:38,634
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

623
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,807
<i>I needed the cash and
the locker was open...</i>

624
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,744
I've never heard of
a neurological problem

625
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,815
that causes
someone's skin to fall off.

626
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,340
Because there isn't one.

627
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:59,389
The aneurysm is just another
symptom, it's not the cause.

628
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:02,392
We add them
all together, we get...

629
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,591
We get...

630
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:13,267
Kaw... Kawa... It's Kawasaki's disease.
It's autoimmune.

631
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,901
Yes, we knew what "Kawa" meant,

632
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,879
we just figured, since it basically
presents only in Asian children...

633
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,780
Which you might have,
by the way.

634
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:23,443
Which is basically
why we missed it.

635
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,914
Rug burns.

636
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,387
Certain carpet cleaning chemicals
have been linked to it.

637
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,584
Start treatment with
intravenous immunoglobulin

638
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:30,955
and monitor the aneurysm.

639
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,858
If it doesn't resolve itself,
we'll have to repair it.

640
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:36,529
Rest of you
aren't surfing enough.

641
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:47,272
Monkey DNA. Nice touch.

642
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:48,435
Really?

643
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,638
You don't think I
should have gone with rat?

644
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,772
I've been second
guessing myself all day.

645
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:55,613
Where are the DNA results?

646
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,880
First admit that I was right.

647
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:58,943
You manipulated
me into doing it.

648
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,044
Yeah, I'll admit to that.

649
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,818
<i>Now you admit that it
was incredibly easy,</i>

650
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:03,256
because you can't
cheat an honest man.

651
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:06,089
I love them. I don't care if one
of them isn't biologically mine.

652
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,061
What about both?

653
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,457
It could be.
I haven't read these.

654
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:11,829
Now say I was right.

655
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,568
No. I'll admit I
was weak for a moment,

656
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:20,074
but I'm not doing this,
I don't care.

657
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,610
You do and I'll prove it.

658
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:26,913
I will shred this,
I'll call off my pool,

659
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,315
return the money and
we'll forget all about it.

660
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,512
Or we'll go to
the light box in the lab

661
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,782
and know the truth
once and for all.

662
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:40,018
Stop.

663
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,023
Let me see them.

664
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,807
Just wanted to make sure
all three were inside.

665
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,342
The mayor checked.

666
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,914
There wasn't any money missing
from the scholarship fund.

667
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:36,975
Dr. Chase told me
about your disease,

668
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,413
how it made you confess to
crimes you hadn't committed.

669
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,334
The affair with that girl,

670
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,498
is that real?

671
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:03,869
Honey, I...

672
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:15,547
would never,
have never cheated on you.

673
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:24,697
I knew you could
never do that to me.

674
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:28,033
I don't know how, but I knew.

675
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:47,720
Glad to see taking a year off
didn't dull your skill set.

676
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:48,985
I got lucky.

677
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:52,583
About the other night

678
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,724
I have enough
problems with this job.

679
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:58,728
Second guessing my best doctors
shouldn't be one of them.

680
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,469
Why are you up here?

681
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,234
You have your own
bathroom and office now.

682
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:09,574
To shower. I haven't left
the hospital in four days.

683
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:10,977
Why?

684
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,742
House won't go home
and there's no way

685
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,510
I'm leaving him
here unsupervised.

686
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,817
House is screwing with you.

687
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,597
By not screwing with you.

688
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,599
He's watching TV and
drinking martinis all night.

689
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,428
Meanwhile,
he's keeping you here

690
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,664
searching for a plan
that doesn't even exist.

691
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,537
How the hell did
I not see that?

692
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,713
I'm glad you're back.

693
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,153
Me, too.

694
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:08,130
Either a hot tub or a sauna.

695
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,297
A hot tub would be cool.

696
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:13,473
New team, old team,

697
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:17,643
I present phase one

698
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:20,706
of operation Outer Office 2.0.

699
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:31,559
Nothing's changed.

700
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,396
Oh, everything has changed.

701
00:43:01,846 --> 00:43:03,018
No.
