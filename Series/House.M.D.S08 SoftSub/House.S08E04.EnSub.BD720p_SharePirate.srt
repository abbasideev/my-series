1
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,414
Nice tie.

2
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,530
Are you at least gonna
call the cops this time?

3
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,660
Oh. Then they might stop.

4
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:03,265
Just when they're beginning
to capture my eyes.

5
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,603
Come on, Dad.
Let Rodrigo do this.

6
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,007
Your arthritis is obviously...

7
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,171
I can pick up my own lawn.

8
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,609
You know, if you wanted, you
could put an end to all this.

9
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,913
Of course. There are other
ways to save the company.

10
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:18,247
I'm only moving it to China
because I'm craving egg foo yung.

11
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:22,925
You know, I just got off the
phone with some investors.

12
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,187
Yes, and they want
a controlling interest?

13
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,762
We get to stay here
with the people

14
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,765
who've been so
loyal to this company.

15
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,460
Everyone keeps their jobs.

16
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:36,199
It's been a family business for 120 years.
There's no way I'm letting...

17
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:41,936
What's wrong?

18
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,076
Dad?

19
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:52,780
Dad?

20
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:05,067
I need you to
drive me to a doctor.

21
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,436
This would totally suck.

22
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:22,316
Patient's visited China a lot recently.
What about the JBE virus?

23
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,911
Why don't you check
his vaccination record

24
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,150
before you make
another stupid...

25
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,919
OMFG. 50% off cupcakes.

26
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,427
How sick is the patient?
'Cause this expires today.

27
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:36,628
Central serous retinopathy? It's
linked to type-A personalities.

28
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,033
Funduscopic exam was normal.

29
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,531
If you don't let me
read my email,

30
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,003
then I won't be
able to read the email

31
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,631
to the entire staff
from your ex-boss.

32
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,608
Thank you.

33
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:55,651
"Last month, I had an incident
involving another PPTH employee.

34
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,484
"Though I can't speak to
the details of the case,

35
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,455
"while my disciplinary
hearing is pending,

36
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,890
"I want you to know
that I have completed

37
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:03,552
"voluntary sexual
harassment training.

38
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,529
"And on a personal note, if my
actions caused anyone distress,

39
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,032
"I sincerely apologize."

40
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,667
You are so fired.

41
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,404
What? He apologized.

42
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,633
What? Because he
said he apologized?

43
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,075
He's saying he's sorry
that someone, namely you,

44
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,873
overreacted,
namely by punching him.

45
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,173
He grabbed my behind.

46
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,148
The word is it was a celebratory
slap after you completed

47
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,378
your first ever
AVM embolization.

48
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,181
He grabbed it, he
apologized for grabbing it

49
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,849
and now he's taking classes
because he grabbed it.

50
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,754
The classes make
him sympathetic.

51
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,920
Which, in turn, makes his
unrepentant attacker evil.

52
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:42,895
Which, in turn, in turn,
makes you so fired.

53
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,696
100 bucks says
I won't get fired.

54
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,071
Oh, you don't want to bet me.

55
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,207
Oh, my...

56
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,738
You're fired.

57
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,608
Uh, the bet is...
But I thought...

58
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:01,708
after...

59
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:02,879
then... if only...

60
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,758
The bet's that I'll get
fired after my hearing.

61
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:11,762
I'll take that action, too, but
you're already a C-note in the hole.

62
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,287
You're late.

63
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:16,924
Considering I don't work
here, arguably, I'm early.

64
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,737
Pearl earrings?
Knee length dress?

65
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,272
It's not a very
shameful walk of shame.

66
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,738
I was at a job interview.

67
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,436
I hope it went terribly.

68
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,545
Thad Barton? We only
help rich white guys'?

69
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,877
I am an equal
opportunity exploiter.

70
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,246
I only help those who can help
myself

71
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,216
I have
a department to re-fund.

72
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,753
Atropine poisoning.

73
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,979
He's moving
his company to China

74
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,286
and his employees are
hanging him in effigy.

75
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,626
They could have moved
on to the real thing.

76
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:44,787
Pupils are normal.

77
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,091
Thyrotoxicosis?

78
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,625
Not a terrible idea.

79
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:54,069
I'm gonna go give
him PTU and TLC.

80
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,071
I have no idea what that
second one stands for.

81
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,439
Things don't seem small anymore.
They were...

82
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,238
I woke up from a nap

83
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:08,580
and everything went from
really small lo really huge.

84
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,753
Well, then these giant balls of
medicine are not gonna work anymore.

85
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,286
The change actually
makes things simpler.

86
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,157
Your occipital lobe is acting
up, giving you a migraine.

87
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,697
But I don't have a headache.

88
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,164
Not all migraines
present that way.

89
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,993
It's called Alice in
Wonderland Syndrome.

90
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,268
- Seriously?
- I never joke.

91
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,672
Good news is it's
treatable with medication.

92
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:33,802
Bad news is it can
make you very, very late

93
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,976
for very important dates.

94
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,609
I sometimes joke.

95
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,941
Thank you, Doctor.

96
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,518
Well, if you really
want to thank me...

97
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:45,180
My department's not
really a department

98
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,019
'cause my boss says
he doesn't have the money,

99
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,888
which provides
a nice contrast with you.

100
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,464
We're trying to find
money in our budget

101
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,796
so we don't have to move
our operations overseas.

102
00:05:56,623 --> 00:06:00,196
I get it. Answer's no.
Shouldn't have said anything.

103
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,137
I'm just glad that the symptoms
showed up before you left for China.

104
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,642
'Cause I'm not sure
the doctors over there

105
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,475
would be so optimistic
considering...

106
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,651
What are you
guys talking about?

107
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,814
Oh, just how different
the two cultures are'

108
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,353
For example, our opinions
on mental illness.

109
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,428
'Cause here, it's considered a
normal, treatable condition.

110
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,268
Ls everything okay?

111
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,500
Everything's fine.

112
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,844
I could have you
checked into a facility

113
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,043
that exclusively
treats mental disorder.

114
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,845
How's that sound?

115
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,748
Whatever's gonna
get him better.

116
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:53,450
Let's try the medication first.

117
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,557
You're hired.

118
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:07,702
You guys are gonna love
Doctors Chase and Taub.

119
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,697
Keep your Nazi sentiments
quiet around the little one.

120
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,538
You got the money?
How?

121
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,304
Patient's a smart businessman.

122
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,143
But he's destroying
thousands of jobs.

123
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:20,081
Jobs are not being destroyed.
They're being relocated.

124
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,208
The fact that you see
that as inherently bad

125
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,585
means you're
an irrational patriot.

126
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,657
To put it another way,
a patriot.

127
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,555
Patriotism is natural.

128
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,719
We've always relied on our
tribes to keep us safe.

129
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,123
It's helpful for
society if its members

130
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,665
have positive feelings
about that society.

131
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,235
Iranian women?
Drag queens in Uganda?

132
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,236
Patriotism is nothing
but loyalty to real estate.

133
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,898
Real estate that's been conquered
800 times by 800 different regimes

134
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,272
with 800 different cultures.

135
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,241
But each time,
it's just the best.

136
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,182
I claim this burger in the name
of Queen Isabella of Spain.

137
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,282
I'll go check on the patient.

138
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,582
I have hepatitis C.

139
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,427
She got it from me.

140
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,700
Hey, how's my dad doing?

141
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,034
Great. His vision's
back to normal

142
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,307
and if he remains asymptomatic
through the night,

143
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,813
we'll be able to
release him in the morning.

144
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,713
Any chance that could
happen before 9:00?

145
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,943
Our stock dropped a couple points
today with the news that he's sick.

146
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,546
I would love for him to get out
of here before the market opens.

147
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:38,785
No offense, but I think it's
terrible your dad's closing down

148
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,956
all your American operations.

149
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,635
I don't think he's moving
the company out of greed.

150
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,398
He's moving it out of grief.

151
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,642
My mom,
she died four months ago.

152
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,800
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

153
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,137
and ifs been hard for him.

154
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,547
Living in their house,
driving down the same streets.

155
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,812
I mean, he's constantly
reminded of her.

156
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,214
Dad?

157
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,656
I need
an intubation kit in here.

158
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,750
What's going on?

159
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,990
Angiography showed a hemorrhagic
site in the left lower lobe.

160
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:19,161
I think it could be
hyperviscosity syndrome.

161
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:23,340
Are you sure Foreman's okay
with us being in his office?

162
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,000
He's never gonna know.

163
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,578
He's actually
in here right now.

164
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,578
Blood count and protein
count are normal.

165
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,513
I think it could be
hyperviscosity syndrome.

166
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,912
Sorry, but after Park sent
out her hospital-wide

167
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,010
non-apology apology
this morning,

168
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,681
I assume that plagiarism
is the new black.

169
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,349
If it makes Andrews
look sympathetic...

170
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,620
Copying him makes
you look pathetic.

171
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,590
And I will pay you not to go
to anger management classes.

172
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,790
What about another
clotting problem?

173
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,428
Factor V Leiden deficiency.

174
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,523
It's possible.

175
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,131
Adams is the one who needs
to deal with her anger.

176
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,861
Myelodysplastic syndrome.

177
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,305
I heard about your conversation
with the patient's daughter.

178
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,432
You were hostile.

179
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,478
Well, their company is making a
decision I strongly disagree with.

180
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,377
Yet you were never
anything but courteous

181
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,780
to the racists and
rapists in prison.

182
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,476
Those guys made
decisions you supported?

183
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:08,814
Myelodysplastic syndrome.

184
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,387
I'm guessing it has
something to do with

185
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,548
the funeral you attended
yesterday morning.

186
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,953
I was at a job interview.

187
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,958
You got to work at 9:15.

188
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,289
Closest hospital
with an opening

189
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,260
in your specialty
is 45 minutes away.

190
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,422
It's not possible.
My condolences.

191
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,500
I wasn't at a funeral.

192
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:29,237
Well, that just leaves
everywhere but a job interview.

193
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,569
Get out.

194
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,170
Who goes there?
Reveal yourself.

195
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,469
Now.

196
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,138
Well, we would
but orthopedics is still

197
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:40,081
squatting in
two thirds of my office.

198
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,416
Which is weird because you got
a large check last night.

199
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:49,086
From a corporation that's going through
a very public belt-tightening,

200
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,354
means this donation
was given under duress.

201
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:52,930
Patient didn't tell me
the whole story,

202
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:57,764
but he did say he'd be thrilled
if we didn't cash this.

203
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:03,039
Got a policy review meeting in
here in five minutes. Goodbye.

204
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,183
What are you doing?

205
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,445
Holding your ass.

206
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,514
You really didn't know?
House...

207
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:17,883
I was trying to
help you out here.

208
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,684
I figured for sure
he'd punch me in the face,

209
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,884
thus proving it's
a natural response.

210
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,159
My God, you have
superhuman discipline.

211
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:29,622
And glutes.

212
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,395
Get your hands off me.

213
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,800
Sorry.

214
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:40,569
Go.

215
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,637
Why did you do mm?

216
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,344
We have a bet.

217
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,252
But he's the chair of the
disciplinary committee.

218
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,821
Forget about the bet.

219
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,982
You two really need to
do your homework on me.

220
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,925
Treat the patient
with activated protein C.

221
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,724
If he has myelodysplastic
syndrome, he'll bleed out.

222
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:03,494
And if he has Factor V Leiden
deficiency, he'll throw another clot.

223
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,669
Exactly.
It's a conclusive test.

224
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,699
There's no actual risk.

225
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,329
As long as you're
both paying attention

226
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,036
and are both good
enough to work here.

227
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,172
I hear one of you
thinks I'm a real bastard.

228
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,408
I guess that would be me.

229
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:25,019
Your boss uses blackmail and you
question my professional ethics?

230
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:29,459
Will you be instituting worker safety
regulations in your new factories?

231
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:30,619
Oh, absolutely.

232
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:31,957
What about juice boxes
in the break room

233
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,428
for the children
you'll be hiring?

234
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,227
Charges of child exploitation
against American companies

235
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,063
have been blown
way out of proportion.

236
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:43,038
My 10-year-old cousin lives near Cebu
City, works at an American factory.

237
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,697
I am so sorry.

238
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,399
It's the best thing for him.

239
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,275
It sucks' but the Filipino
factories suck worse.

240
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,281
And the schools would
suck if they existed.

241
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,882
So this is
the family's best hope.

242
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,449
Are you okay?

243
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,114
Is it supposed
to itch like this?

244
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,626
Itching. Interesting.

245
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,893
Not interesting.
Already went away.

246
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,727
Doubly interesting.

247
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,402
Means we have to explain the
arrival and the departure.

248
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,933
Ooh!

249
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,737
That's real mature, House.
What do you mean?

250
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,803
It's outlandishly childish.
I custom built this puppy.

251
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,609
It's got 106 LED's,

252
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,579
each one sending
light to your eye

253
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,516
at a slightly
different wavelength.

254
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:29,609
Turn that off.

255
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,019
The different wavelengths
are stimulating

256
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,851
your autonomic nervous system.

257
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,922
It's making you feel like you're
on a boat in choppy waters.

258
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,596
On, cool.

259
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,763
You think I'm not.“

260
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,632
You think I'm not gonna
go to Foreman with this?

261
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,201
You will and I'll deny it.

262
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,177
He'll believe you,
but then these two

263
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,648
believe that the policy of protecting
American jobs starts at home,

264
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,982
so they'll never
testify against me.

265
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,687
And you won't be
able to prove anything.

266
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,490
Now, if I punched him in the
face, that he could prove.

267
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,461
I remember you saying something

268
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,963
about how loyalty to
real estate was stupid.

269
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,863
This is about reclaiming
stolen property.

270
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:21,298
Loyalty to real estate is stupid
because loyalty is stupid.

271
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,671
First patriotism, now loyalty.

272
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,970
You hate ice cream, too?

273
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:26,570
French vanilla, yeah.

274
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,712
To willfully identify
yourself with something else

275
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,509
is a perversion
of self-expression.

276
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,811
I had a thought.

277
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,977
Other than the fact
that loyalty is the basis

278
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,884
of all meaningful
relationships.

279
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:40,023
The daughter said that her mother
died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

280
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,087
What if she was misdiagnosed?

281
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,360
Dutch chocolate's not bad.
Gotta give them that.

282
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,264
Her lymphoma could have been
caused by a virus, HTLV-1,

283
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,769
which our patient contracted
through having sex with his wife.

284
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,841
In other words,
loyalty gave him cancer.

285
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,540
I like it.
Start him on radiation.

286
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:06,209
Chang and Eng Bunker, the most
famous conjoined twins in history.

287
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,183
2011 is the bicentennial
of their birth.

288
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,952
The best Halloween costumes are always
the ones that need an explanation.

289
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,583
What took you so long?

290
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,257
We already lost one of them.

291
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,795
You need help
with the lacerations?

292
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,091
No. I think
I've got palliative.

293
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,392
Why don't you
take preventative?

294
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,530
Prevent what?
He got in a fight.

295
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,203
Which he started, which means
he's both irascible and stupid.

296
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,603
I told the drunk,
racist frat guy

297
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,106
the proper term is "conjoined
twin", not "Siamese".

298
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,604
Well, I can't comment
on the drunk or the frat,

299
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,771
but Chang and Eng
were both, in fact,

300
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,214
born in Siam and they were,
in fact, twins.

301
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,478
If your name was Richard, it'd be
okay for me to call you a dick.

302
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,282
I thought maybe
some of the tripe

303
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:46,823
you learnt in
anger management class

304
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,223
could help keep this guy
out of here the next time.

305
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:54,095
Sometimes, it's incredibly satisfying
to wind up and punch someone

306
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,223
who really deserves it,

307
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,892
but when you think about
the consequences...

308
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,128
Okay, let's go.

309
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,237
I thought you wanted me
to help him with his anger.

310
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,000
No. I got
everything I need.

311
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,636
"Sometimes, it's incredibly
satisfying to wind up

312
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,733
"and punch someone
who deserves it."

313
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,005
Wonder what the committee's
gonna make of that.

314
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,615
<i>This is a waste of time. There's
no way that Robin gave me an STD.</i>

315
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:26,287
I know this is hard and I
am sorry about your wife.

316
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,259
If you'd like to
talk to someone

317
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,494
we do have grief counselors
at the hospital.

318
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:31,795
<i>You sound like my daughter.</i>

319
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,503
<i>I miss my wife, but it's not
driving my decision making.</i>

320
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,809
You were CEO since 1988.

321
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,279
You decided to move your company
right after your wife died.

322
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,145
<i>Stands to reason that
your emotions factored in.</i>

323
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:47,679
My wife...

324
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,854
is the only thing
that keeps me here.

325
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,987
<i>I visit her grave once a week.</i>

326
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,231
So your daughter was wrong.

327
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,469
You just really
need a lot of money.

328
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,739
<i>You ever hear of Kongo Gumi?</i>

329
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,880
A construction company in
Japan, founded in the year 578,

330
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,076
family owned and operated,

331
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:25,088
building Buddhist temples
for 50 generations.

332
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:30,155
Went bankrupt five years ago.

333
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:34,924
You have any idea how that
last CEO must have felt?

334
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,094
<i>I'm sorry.
I have to move.</i>

335
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,773
Your heart rate is speeding up.

336
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,107
Do you feel any
tightness in your chest?

337
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,341
Yes. I figured it
was from the radiation.

338
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,243
I think you're
having a heart attack.

339
00:17:58,344 --> 00:17:59,755
Come in.

340
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,525
Dr. Wilson,
I need your advice.

341
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,018
Um...

342
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,294
I bet House $100
that I wouldn't get fired

343
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,368
after my disciplinary hearing.

344
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,767
Ever since then,
he's been acting like

345
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,032
he's actually
trying to get me fired.

346
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,933
That's because he is actually
trying to get you fired.

347
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,766
Does he hate me?

348
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,709
Not sure that's
relevant to the equation.

349
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,805
So it's really over $100?

350
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,645
Not sure the amount is relevant.
He's fighting for his honor.

351
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,280
He'll ruin my career.

352
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,445
Not sure that's.4.

353
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,217
What if I bet him
$200 I will get fired?

354
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,886
He sees competing bets with the same
person as a disgrace to the game.

355
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,226
He'll be even more
motivated to beat you.

356
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,558
If you were me,
what would you do?

357
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:50,602
You have to give him something
he values more than honor.

358
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,169
And you should
update your resume.

359
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,821
EKG and
troponins were equivocal.

360
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,913
It's not even clear
if our patient

361
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,960
just had a heart attack
or what it was.

362
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,528
Let's look at segmental
wall motion abnormalities.

363
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:16,862
Get him an echo to confirm.
And I need $200,000.

364
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:20,966
His company's lost one third of
its value since he was admitted.

365
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,266
And you want to do
some insider trading?

366
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,603
I take it felonies aren't a
violation of your parole?

367
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:30,112
It's not insider trading. Just
betting on myself to solve the case.

368
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:33,342
Once we cure him, share price
goes up, I pay you back.

369
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,474
No.

370
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,985
No, you don't say "no" '
you make a counteroffer.

371
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,279
I'm not loaning my boss money.

372
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,960
Fine. I'll make a counter.
$100,000?

373
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,152
$20,000?

374
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,056
I'll buy options instead of shares.
More risk, but more upside.

375
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,634
But that's as low
as I'm gonna go.

376
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,198
I could do $5,000.

377
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,532
Really? No backsies.

378
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:58,802
If you double
your clinic hours.

379
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,343
Six a week.

380
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,703
I've seen how you
disrespect those patients.

381
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:05,043
So you want twice as many
of them to be disrespected?

382
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,983
Spend more hours with them,
you'll treat them more humanely.

383
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:14,256
And this time, a land war in
Russia will be a good idea.

384
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,584
Deal?

385
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,897
Here's what I'm thinking.
You went to a parole hearing

386
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,159
where one of your old
patients was denied.

387
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,733
Hence the attire,
hence the tardiness,

388
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,101
and most important,
hence the anger.

389
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,405
You think you can
restore the cosmic balance

390
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,339
by doing extra good here.

391
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,206
More annoyingly
by having me do it.

392
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,404
And deal.

393
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:06,434
Of course,
you know this means war.

394
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,373
Oh, I know.

395
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,548
I mean, you'll escalate
and then I'll retaliate,

396
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:12,978
and the cycle will continue

397
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:14,745
until we've both gone too far.

398
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:21,223
At which point, I'll maybe get suspended
and you'll go back to prison.

399
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,422
Happy pranking.

400
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,904
Patient had V-Tack in
the echo lab, so we cathed him,

401
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,408
but coronary
arteries were clean.

402
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:43,106
If the plumbing's fine, check
the electrical. EP study.

403
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,640
Nice idea.
Even has a metaphor in it.

404
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,645
Not worth more than my honor,
but delightful all the same.

405
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:54,990
I'm not going to lose.

406
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:59,095
My college roommate is the
editor of the Yale Law Review.

407
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,362
She's writing
my opening statement.

408
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,592
Well, then you'll be
eloquent in your loss.

409
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,700
This case boils down to,
"He said, she said."

410
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,135
He said, "I've been working
at this hospital for 15 years

411
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,705
"and I am taking
self-improvement classes."

412
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,002
She said, "I've been a
fellow for two months

413
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,269
"and I'm kind of weird."

414
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,969
No, he said, "I'm a drunk idiot

415
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,604
"who thinks he can
grab girls' behinds

416
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:17,942
"without ramifications"

417
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,111
Wait, he was drunk?
In the hospital?

418
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:22,345
I already told Foreman he'd
been drinking that night.

419
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:26,321
Andrews was taking sexual
harassment classes, not AA.

420
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,992
That means he didn't get
in trouble for drinking.

421
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,324
Which means that
Foreman signed off on it,

422
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,456
which means that he set
all the wheels in motion.

423
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:42,668
Forget that. Wild speculation.
Go do the EP study.

424
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:52,641
You already knew Andrews was
drinking that night, didn't you?

425
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:54,640
Yes.

426
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,181
I think you should
cancel my hearing.

427
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,549
I hope this isn't going
where I assume it's going.

428
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,321
You're the one who
brought Andrews in.

429
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,659
You set the wheels in motion.

430
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:15,667
We had a patient who was going to
die without an AVM embolization.

431
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:19,373
Andrews was the only
neurologist I could reach.

432
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,736
He told me he had a few glasses of
wine and that he shouldn't do it,

433
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:25,338
but he also said
that you were good,

434
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:28,776
and you were ready to do one as
long as you were supervised.

435
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,410
So we agreed that
he would come in,

436
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,045
but wouldn't touch the patient.

437
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,418
I can understand
the rationalization.

438
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:35,890
We'll see if the board agrees

439
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:38,519
when I tell them the whole
story at my hearing.

440
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,523
I already did.

441
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,366
I had a closed session
hearing last week.

442
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:48,128
The board decided to
dock me two weeks' pay.

443
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,033
Oh.

444
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:58,480
You've been working for House for
two weeks, it's already too long.

445
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:07,389
No sign of any electrical
abnormalities in the right atrium.

446
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,117
I'm so dead.

447
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,717
I think House set me up.

448
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:16,732
Have you sent the committee
a character reference for me?

449
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,297
I thought you
don't like favors.

450
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,097
I don't like gifts.
It wouldn't be a gift,

451
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,832
it'd just be you
telling the truth.

452
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:23,798
I hardly know you.

453
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,805
02 sat is 89. Did we perforate?
Is he tamponading'?

454
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:32,314
Heart rate's only 90
and neck veins are flat.

455
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,179
Then why isn't he saturating?

456
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,318
Seems healthy to me.

457
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,859
Let's release him.

458
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:49,923
My option to sell Barton Foods
at $34 is about to expire

459
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,593
'cause I thought the patient
would be better by now.

460
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:55,330
Instead,
I am going to lose $20,000.

461
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:56,531
Twenty?

462
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,336
Your five plus the five
I stole from Wilson

463
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,342
plus the 10 I got on margin.

464
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,435
You're gonna have to talk
to my bankruptcy attorney.

465
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:08,547
Unless... There is a way that
you can get your money back.

466
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,512
Give me the full $200,000.

467
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:16,785
And extrapolating. Tomorrow, you'll
owe just shy of a million dollars.

468
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,455
It's your own fault. You forced
me to go with the options.

469
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,125
Your damn anger issues are
screwing with my finances.

470
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,365
Regular stock this time,
nice and safe.

471
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,559
I'm not angry.

472
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,035
I don't know if you're trying
to make me angry, but...

473
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,733
You refuse to bet on yourself.
That means low self-esteem.

474
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:34,035
So if I give you $200,000,
I'll feel smart and pretty?

475
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,737
Low self-esteem
can be brought on

476
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,973
by exposure to one's relatives.

477
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:42,217
Nice clothes and anger, classic
symptoms of a family gathering.

478
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,416
You were late the other day

479
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,886
'cause you were
having breakfast

480
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:48,322
with Grammy Adams
or Cousin Itt.

481
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,894
She was nagging you
about finding a husband.

482
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,553
All right.
This is getting annoying.

483
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,562
I'll just tell you what I was...
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

484
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,231
No spoilers.
They ruin everything.

485
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,997
Pulmonology was that way.

486
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,164
Our patient's lung problem
is not a lung problem.

487
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:06,332
It's a brain problem. We're
consulting with neurology.

488
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,034
That's my old boss.

489
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:10,169
You don't actually think
this is neurological.

490
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,270
I don't know what it is.

491
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:14,448
But maybe I should just
accept the patient's death

492
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,214
if getting help would
lead to awkwardness.

493
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:24,624
Dr. Andrews, my associates,
Doctors Adams and Park.

494
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,555
Ah.

495
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,567
Nice to meet you,
Dr. Adams.

496
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,737
Hello, Dr. Park.

497
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,598
You two know each other?

498
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,540
It's a small world.

499
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,707
Dr. Park, maybe you'd like to
update our esteemed colleague

500
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,943
on the condition
of our patient?

501
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:55,088
Micropsia, bleeding, tachycardia
and difficulty breathing.

502
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,324
Cute butt, huh?

503
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,123
Can we go now?

504
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:05,293
What, you really want to
turn your back on this guy'?

505
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:06,801
Sorry. Carry on.

506
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:08,828
Uh...

507
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:12,306
Well, it sounds like there could
be spinal cord involvement.

508
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:15,674
Have you considered normal
pressure hydrocephalus?

509
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,244
Okay. Normal pressure
hydrocephalus going once.

510
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,013
Normal pressure
hydrocephalus going twice...

511
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:24,815
It's not his spinal cord,

512
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,584
it's the wiring between
his heart and his brain.

513
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,523
Autonomic
dysregulation syndrome.

514
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:33,262
We do a tilt table test, see
how his heart rate responds.

515
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,623
That'll confirm.

516
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,994
Well, if he has normal
pressure hydrocephalus,

517
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,864
a tilt table test
could put him in a coma.

518
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,096
Then it's a good thing
he has ADS.

519
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:45,106
You really believe
in this diagnosis?

520
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,666
Because if this is
just a pissing contest,

521
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,608
you're at a severe
anatomical disadvantage.

522
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,943
It's autonomic
dysregulation syndrome.

523
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:54,040
No, it's normal
pressure hydrocephalus.

524
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,141
Do a spinal fluid test
to confirm.

525
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,850
We're doing the tilt table.

526
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,151
That makes sense.

527
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,193
You'd rather have House
fire you than Foreman.

528
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:06,161
This bet's gotta be a test, see
if I can handle working with him.

529
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:09,461
I need to prove I have the
confidence to disobey him.

530
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,902
Do you have any medical
justification for your diagnosis?

531
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,666
The symptoms fit
and Andrews is a hack.

532
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:18,736
Do you think I'm right?

533
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,479
Let's go.
No.

534
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:28,383
You need to go
prepare for your hearing.

535
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:38,194
Fifteen more minutes,
Mr. Barton.

536
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:41,687
A skin resurfacing
laser is missing.

537
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:43,997
And why are you
asking me about it?

538
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,330
Because you work for House.

539
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,167
What would House want
with a skin resurfacing laser?

540
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,264
I have no idea.
Have you seen it?

541
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,005
My feet feel hot.

542
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,600
That's completely normal.

543
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,672
No. But House has
been talking about how

544
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,840
badly he wants to
remove those prison tats.

545
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,852
It's a very expensive machine
and I'd like it back.

546
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,854
Please tell me
if you hear anything.

547
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,781
How expensive?

548
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,185
$200,000.

549
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:13,719
He took it.

550
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:15,423
I have no idea.

551
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,931
Park's hearing's
about to start.

552
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,702
You're covering for him. I did
the same thing many times.

553
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:21,962
My advice to you,

554
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,631
figure out what line you aren't
willing to cross for him.

555
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,074
Because, eventually,
he'll ask you to cross it.

556
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,309
How are your feet?

557
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:39,717
Mr. Barton?

558
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,228
Can you hear me, Mr. Barton?

559
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,323
Oh, no.

560
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:56,297
We have convened
the Disciplinary Committee

561
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:57,669
to decide
the appropriate action

562
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,606
that should be taken
against Dr. Chi Park

563
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:03,408
as a result of her actions
on October 7th of this year.

564
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,470
Dr. Park, do you have
an opening statement?

565
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,914
Dr. Foreman,
members of the committee,

566
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:12,251
thank you for giving me this opportunity
to speak to you today. I...

567
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,122
Good news. You can cancel the hearing,
because I'm firing her myself.

568
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:17,249
She's not yours to fire...

569
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,327
Then you guys better fire
her for insubordination.

570
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:21,455
She went rogue and my
patient is now in a coma.

571
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,587
I'm the one who did the test...

572
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,792
No. It was my idea.

573
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:24,925
Seriously, House?

574
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,970
At least I'm smart enough
to know what I don't know.

575
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,504
She went out of her way
to defy me, she needs...

576
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,801
Damn it, she...
Just fire her!

577
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,432
My apologies.

578
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,772
My apologies, Dr. Park.

579
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,479
Dr. House's comments
will, of course,

580
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,279
have no bearing
on this hearing.

581
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,176
Please continue.

582
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,786
I, uh...

583
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,457
I can't believe you did that.

584
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,288
Right back at you.

585
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:55,996
Our patient's dying
We need theories.

586
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:58,158
It's gotta be normal
pressure hydrocephalus.

587
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,701
Andrews predicted the coma.

588
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,469
Yeah, but even a broken
doctor is right twice a day.

589
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,666
The patient wasn't
wet, wabbly or wacky.

590
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,208
The coma had to
be a lucky guess.

591
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,370
If you didn't
think he was right,

592
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:11,675
then why did you want us to
collect his spinal fluid?

593
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,010
I didn't. I wanted you
to do a tilt table test.

594
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:16,176
You have a wonderful
way of communicating.

595
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:17,912
I knew Park wanted
to do a tilt table.

596
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:21,388
If she listens to me, I waste
an hour, if she defies me,

597
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,525
then I get the test
I want and my 100 bucks.

598
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:25,889
Up high.

599
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,655
You're an ass.

600
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:29,154
You're angry.

601
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:31,161
Yes. Now I'm angry.

602
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,366
Let's run the test for normal
pressure hydrocephalus.

603
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:35,694
No.

604
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,170
What else would
explain our symptoms

605
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,836
and make our patient go
into a coma during that test?

606
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,604
What about
hepatic encephalopathy?

607
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:46,512
No. We already tested his liver enzymes.
They're normal.

608
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:49,584
Or his liver's so far gone,
it can't even produce enzymes.

609
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,218
That's desperate.

610
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,055
It fits the symptoms.

611
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:55,089
And Andrews is a hack.

612
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:59,257
Go biopsy to confirm, unless
you want your own hearing.

613
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,860
You'd have to hire me first.

614
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:10,096
So you do realize
that it is unacceptable

615
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:11,765
to hit someone
in the work place?

616
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,366
Yes.
Completely unacceptable.

617
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,104
I wasn't thinking.
I guess...

618
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:19,375
I mean, I guess,
technically, I was thinking.

619
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:23,876
It happened so fast,
I didn't... I...

620
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:26,714
It's like...

621
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:32,291
It's like it wasn't even me. I would
never do something like that.

622
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,060
Even though I did.

623
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:39,092
I'm sorry I'm not
making any sense right now.

624
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:45,337
I don't know. I just really
love being a doctor so much,

625
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:49,776
and I barely even
have $100 and...

626
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,609
Please don't fire me.

627
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,086
Is this theory more
promising than the others?

628
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,826
We'll know in a few hours.

629
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,754
How are you holding up?

630
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,826
Other than the fact
that my dad's in a coma,

631
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:14,759
terrible.

632
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,271
Tomorrow morning, I am supposed
to sign a piece of paper

633
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,674
that will move the company

634
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,803
and cost thousands of
employees their jobs.

635
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:25,714
I thought you'd
rather see the company

636
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:27,647
go under in New Jersey
than thrive in China.

637
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:32,452
It's what my dad wants,
and it's still his company.

638
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,684
I'm really just
keeping the seat warm.

639
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:38,288
But unless he wakes up
before tomorrow,

640
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,661
it's gonna be my signature
on that piece of paper.

641
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,336
You don't have to sign it.

642
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,842
I'll let you know
when we have the results.

643
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,490
Biopsy was clean.
It's not his liver.

644
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,327
I also ran
the spinal fluid test,

645
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:23,063
and you were right
that Andrews was wrong.

646
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,835
His ICP was not normal,
it was elevated.

647
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,502
What about HTLV?

648
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,178
We ruled that out
three days ago.

649
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:31,712
Because of his heart problems.
But.“

650
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,406
Once something gets
taken off the board,

651
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,178
I'm the only one who's
allowed to put it back on.

652
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:43,022
You owe me 106,804 won.

653
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:45,426
Or $100 US.

654
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:49,092
God, but you're petty.

655
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,728
Okay. So, two options.

656
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,894
Either we figure out
what's wrong with this guy,

657
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,734
or we figure out how to make this
company profitable in New Jersey.

658
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,364
Eastern equine encephalitis?

659
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:03,873
Thinking in here.

660
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,709
Brain scans indicate
it could be Loa loa disease.

661
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,117
Shut it off!

662
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,064
Apparently we're
allowed to do this now.

663
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,968
Get out of here, House.

664
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,403
Start the patient
on plasmapheresis.

665
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,917
He'll wake up in an hour.

666
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,415
It's been a pleasure having
you in the neighborhood.

667
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,299
This diagnosis was brought
to you by the letter Y.

668
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,840
Dad! God, you're okay.

669
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,300
I'm thirsty.

670
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:12,343
It's a side effect
of not dying.

671
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,619
Turns out your blood
was getting thick and syrupy

672
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,485
from complexes of large
Y-shaped antibodies.

673
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,615
<i>They were clogging up
your blood vessels,</i>

674
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,320
<i>causing your organs
to shut down, one by one.</i>

675
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,692
<i>Usually, with
hyperviscosity syndrome,</i>

676
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,526
<i>it's caused by
an elevated blood count</i>

677
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,032
<i>or protein count,
but yours eluded us</i>

678
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,395
<i>because it was
caused by antibodies</i>

679
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,026
<i>from your rheumatoid arthritis.</i>

680
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,832
<i>Now that they're
being filtered out,</i>

681
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,466
your blood will be a little less duck
sauce, and a little more soy sauce.

682
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,876
So I'm gonna be
completely cured?

683
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:45,912
It's not all about you.

684
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:51,184
Your stock price will be completely
cured once you sign this.

685
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,219
It's a press release.

686
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,814
It says that you're healthy,
you're going back to work,

687
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,417
and you're signing the lease that
officially moves the company to China.

688
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:02,089
He just woke up. Dad, you don't
have to deal with this right now.

689
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,559
Actually, he does. Because the
market opens at 9:00 a.m.

690
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,060
And this means a lotto me.

691
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:13,237
You may remember me from the
time I saved your life.

692
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:19,041
If you move it,
it'll be without me.

693
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,919
I know you object,
I know you disagree...

694
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:30,216
Dad. I can't do it.

695
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:37,889
If this is really about
family, you will not do this.

696
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:28,307
Morning.

697
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,419
I got lucky this time.

698
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,582
No, you didn't.

699
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:37,752
I made this bet so you'd stop
actively trying to fire Park,

700
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:41,093
so you'd be neutral. You went
out of your way to help her.

701
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,860
She obviously earned your respect,
passed whatever test you...

702
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,161
I sabotaged her hearing.

703
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,131
You do read the school
paper, don't you?

704
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,465
If you had
sabotaged her hearing,

705
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,370
she would have gotten more
than a slap on the wrist.

706
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,442
What you actually did
was make her emotional,

707
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,034
and make the board members
see her as a victim.

708
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,836
Because the panel
feels badly for

709
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:59,040
incompetent doctors
who nearly kill people.

710
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:00,878
You know that everyone
on that panel hates you.

711
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:03,013
You know the minute you
recommend firing anyone,

712
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:06,213
they start discussing how
big a bonus to give them.

713
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:07,788
That's just hurtful.

714
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:11,387
Fact is, winning $100 from
you gives me more pleasure

715
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:12,859
than winning $100 from her.

716
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,360
Here's your 5 grand.

717
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,396
What 5 grand?

718
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,863
Just take it.
Trust me.

719
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,838
I found her
sleeping in the park.

720
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:35,075
Says she ran away because
her daddy didn't love her.

721
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:39,382
And that is exactly what happened
as far as you can prove.

722
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:42,525
Congratulations. You're
not going to jail. Today.

723
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,820
But you do know I just
can't let this slide.

724
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,863
Well, you need to
keep up your rep.

725
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,730
Fine, clinic hours.
I'll double them.

726
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,060
Okay.
Twelve hours a week.

727
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,705
No. Three times
two equals six.

728
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,674
And three times
two times two is twelve.

729
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:02,208
I know about
your deal with Adams.

730
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:09,374
Call Chase and Taub.

731
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:13,544
Get them in here.
The boys are back.

732
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,758
This check is for
significantly more

733
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,885
than what I told you it would
take to fund the department.

734
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:22,395
I know.

735
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,571
You paged me?

736
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,459
Congratulations.

737
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,764
You caught your boyfriend
cheating that morning.

738
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:06,063
You had a big fight,
that's why you were late.

739
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:10,646
You re-pitched an STD.

740
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:12,946
You haven't gone
two consecutive minutes

741
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,415
without using
the word "loyalty",

742
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:17,142
which explains the anger
and low self-esteem.

743
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,118
And the desire to feel pretty

744
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:21,589
after having been rejected
explains the clothes.

745
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,253
It wasn't my boyfriend.

746
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:31,456
It was my husband.

747
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,360
I was at my lawyer's office
signing the divorce papers.

748
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,098
Wow.

749
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:41,004
I missed the fact
that you were married.

750
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,101
We've been separated
for almost a year.

751
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,145
So... Old news?

752
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,212
No anger left?

753
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,895
It's all bought and paid for.
