1
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:39,018
Sorry for calling so late, sir.

2
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:41,396
- Where are you?
- I'm at a gig, sir.

3
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,981
Exile in Ballymun.

4
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:43,898
Who?

5
00:00:43,982 --> 00:00:45,275
Matt Claffin's band.

6
00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:47,902
Look, I just thought, since
we can't get hold of the Claffins,

7
00:00:47,986 --> 00:00:51,239
I'd do a bit of nosying around.
And you'll never guess who's here.

8
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:52,740
Louis Walsh?

9
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,285
Becka Garvey.

10
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:56,828
His second biggest fan.

11
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:58,121
Sir, what do you want me to do?

12
00:00:58,204 --> 00:01:00,582
Figure it out yourself. I'm in a meeting.

13
00:01:05,211 --> 00:01:08,006
Excuse me. Sorry, can I just…

14
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:10,884
Sorry.

15
00:01:12,552 --> 00:01:13,928
Could you just…

16
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:16,764
Wish I'd had one of these yokes at school.

17
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:20,310
Detective Houlihan. Cheers.

18
00:01:22,687 --> 00:01:24,063
Thought you weren't a fan.

19
00:01:25,023 --> 00:01:26,107
I can't hear you. Sorry?

20
00:01:27,275 --> 00:01:30,028
Well, we can do this somewhere quieter.
Down the station, maybe?

21
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:33,156
I'll never set foot in that station.

22
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,868
Well, you're a person of interest
in John Paul Williams's murder inquiry,

23
00:01:36,951 --> 00:01:38,328
so you might have to.

24
00:01:38,912 --> 00:01:41,331
Did Matt Claffin find out what
you and your sisters did?

25
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:45,501
Is that why you hooked up with him?
Get him to keep his mouth shut?

26
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:48,630
Thank you, Dublin.
We've been Exile in Ballymun.

27
00:01:48,713 --> 00:01:49,923
You've been deadly. Good night.

28
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:51,883
Will you excuse me? I'm kinda done.

29
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:02,185
Becka.

30
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,854
Are you okay?

31
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:06,606
Just feeling a bit sick.

32
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:07,899
What's going on?

33
00:02:07,982 --> 00:02:09,484
Who was your one inside?
I know her from somewhere.

34
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:11,236
The funeral.

35
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:13,696
She's a cop.

36
00:02:14,322 --> 00:02:15,949
She's investigating John Paul's death.

37
00:02:16,032 --> 00:02:17,367
Jesus.

38
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:22,539
- Well, what did she say?
- That I'm a "person of interest."

39
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:24,541
I'm very flattered.

40
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:26,543
Is this some kind of joke to you?

41
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:28,962
- Of course not.
- What are you even doing here?

42
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,756
What am I doing here?

43
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:35,718
- You came to the funeral.
- I thought we needed to check in.

44
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:37,804
You needed to check in?

45
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:41,724
I'll just circle back with you, shall I?

46
00:02:41,808 --> 00:02:43,851
Revert ASAP. Get fucked.

47
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:44,852
Wait, hold on.

48
00:02:44,936 --> 00:02:48,356
I didn't know about any fecking bodies
in any fecking suitcases, okay?

49
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,900
So, I kept a big secret for you guys.

50
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:52,944
So, yeah, I do need to know
what's going on.

51
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:54,654
- There's nothing going on.
- I don't know.

52
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:56,948
There's always something, Becka, with you.

53
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,367
- You know, you were always a bit--
- What?

54
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,451
You used to lie.

55
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:02,537
- You lied to me constantly.
- Well, you deleted me.

56
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,081
- You were fucking ice-cold.
- I risked everything for you.

57
00:03:05,582 --> 00:03:10,128
Yeah, well, my sister's dead now,
so you shouldn't have bothered.

58
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:11,212
Becka.

59
00:03:13,298 --> 00:03:16,968
Becka! I can't
cover for you this time, Becka.

60
00:03:27,812 --> 00:03:28,771
Fu--

61
00:03:57,091 --> 00:04:00,428
I liked it when you turned up the radio
and danced to Doja Cat,

62
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,140
and I like how you smell after a swim.

63
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:08,436
I can't think of another one.

64
00:04:11,856 --> 00:04:12,941
That's okay.

65
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:15,360
Four tomorrow, so…

66
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:19,489
I love you.

67
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,169
Thanks for making me walk.

68
00:05:56,252 --> 00:05:58,463
It's just good to get out
and get some fresh air, you know?

69
00:05:58,546 --> 00:05:59,797
You were starting to turn.

70
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:02,050
Sorry. You okay?

71
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:03,259
My boobs.

72
00:06:05,762 --> 00:06:07,013
There they are.

73
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:09,724
You sure you don't wanna
come and say hi before you go?

74
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:12,143
No, I've got some work to do,
so I'll leave you to it.

75
00:06:12,227 --> 00:06:15,355
Otherwise, it'll be,
"Oh, please stay. Join us."

76
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:18,066
You know, any excuse for them
to see me in my jocks.

77
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:19,609
You are fairly easy on the eye.

78
00:06:20,318 --> 00:06:24,697
And you're really small actually.

79
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:26,783
- What? You are.
- Uh-huh.

80
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:29,202
You are. Why are you so small?

81
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:30,286
You're teeny-weeny.

82
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:51,849
Oy.

83
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:53,935
- What?
- Come look.

84
00:06:57,814 --> 00:07:00,692
We can ask Holy Joe what she did to Grace.

85
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:04,529
She can't hide behind
those lace curtains now.

86
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:23,172
Have you come to do
some community service, good women?

87
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:26,759
Do you have a minute, Angelica?
We'd like a word with you.

88
00:07:29,637 --> 00:07:34,601
Go on. I can talk and do my bit
for the environment at the same time.

89
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:36,895
You told me Grace confessed to you.

90
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,732
Confessed what?

91
00:07:43,318 --> 00:07:44,319
Things.

92
00:07:45,153 --> 00:07:46,154
She might have--

93
00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:49,157
You made out like she opened up to you.

94
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:55,121
Well, yes, we were very close.
I mean, Grace told me everything.

95
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:59,042
Bollocks. Grace was the most cautious
of all of us.

96
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,627
And you weren't very close.

97
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,922
You're a stage-five clinger, and that's
why she had to get away from you.

98
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:06,966
You found out her secret
and you held it over her.

99
00:08:08,384 --> 00:08:10,178
I think you're the reason she's dead.

100
00:08:10,261 --> 00:08:11,930
Is she back on the drugs again?

101
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,431
Why would you say that?

102
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:16,935
Because you're two-faced
and you were blackmailing Grace.

103
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,773
I'd be very careful,
tossing accusations like that around.

104
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:25,318
Shame drove Grace to her death. Not me.

105
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:28,154
I'm not gonna carry your guilt.

106
00:08:29,364 --> 00:08:31,199
You didn't look after her in life.

107
00:08:31,282 --> 00:08:33,700
You let her hang on to that awful secret.

108
00:08:33,785 --> 00:08:35,536
Youse got blood on your hands.

109
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,121
- You nasty old bitch.
- Becka!

110
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,125
Right.

111
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:42,834
A little time bomb.

112
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:49,175
I'd love to keep chatting, but the rubbish
that turns up on this beach.

113
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:52,845
What's wrong with you?

114
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:54,055
What?

115
00:08:54,138 --> 00:08:57,141
She blackmailed our sister
and I'm supposed to be nice?

116
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,018
Becka.

117
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:01,104
This has gone way beyond nice.

118
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:04,566
Let's go.

119
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,944
Becka!

120
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:12,282
Becka, can you please just calm down?

121
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:16,661
How can I calm down? I'm in a sauna.
My blood is literally boiling.

122
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:19,455
- Oh, Christ.
- Jesus Christ.

123
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,042
She can't get away with this.

124
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:24,252
Yeah, I agree.

125
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:26,379
But how do we prove what she did if we--

126
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:29,757
We just-- We turn her gaff
upside down, and we find the money.

127
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:33,803
I mean, you can't walk into a bank with
20 grand without questions being asked.

128
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:36,472
It'll be stashed away somewhere,
I'm telling you.

129
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:38,892
I say we break in.

130
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:40,685
Is the heat getting to you?

131
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:44,814
Just for the sake of argument, how?

132
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:45,815
Wha--

133
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,233
Well, we can discuss it.
Doesn't mean we do it.

134
00:09:47,317 --> 00:09:49,402
It usually does, and it never ends well.

135
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:53,364
Well, go on,
how do you break into a house?

136
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:55,408
How do you get drugs off a trolley?

137
00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:00,079
Church.

138
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:05,543
She goes with Roger at eleven o'clock
every Sunday morning.

139
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:06,920
We could do it then.

140
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:08,046
It's the choir.

141
00:10:09,672 --> 00:10:10,715
Grace sang with them.

142
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,806
Her beautiful voice.

143
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:24,729
How could she bring
another lunatic into her life?

144
00:10:25,522 --> 00:10:26,981
Don't you dare blame Grace.

145
00:10:27,065 --> 00:10:28,525
I didn't mean it like--

146
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:29,984
She was vulnerable.

147
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:33,321
She never saw the bad in anyone.

148
00:10:33,404 --> 00:10:34,948
People take advantage of that.

149
00:10:39,577 --> 00:10:41,371
I wanna cry, but my eyeball is too dry.

150
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:44,916
Oh, fuck. It's so hot.

151
00:10:46,876 --> 00:10:47,877
Oh, shit.

152
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:50,380
I can't be in here.

153
00:10:50,463 --> 00:10:51,464
What?

154
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:54,926
Beck, you're letting all the heat out.

155
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:57,345
So, are we doing this or what?

156
00:10:57,428 --> 00:10:59,931
We are not breaking into
that woman's house.

157
00:11:00,014 --> 00:11:01,683
Well, what else are we gonna do?
Go to the police?

158
00:11:01,766 --> 00:11:03,560
- They'll only ask more questions.
- Becka! We--

159
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:05,562
I need to know what happened to my sister.

160
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:10,233
So either we're doing it,
or I'm doing it myself.

161
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:20,869
Okay.

162
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,872
I'm gonna go. I'm cooked.

163
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,299
So I guess we're breaking into
that woman's house.

164
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:45,852
So have you battery on your phone?

165
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:47,061
I have. Still.

166
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:48,062
Right.

167
00:11:48,146 --> 00:11:49,397
Binoculars?

168
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,815
You got binoculars?

169
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:52,150
What do you mean, do I have binoculars?

170
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:54,444
You never said anything about binoculars.
Do I need binoculars?

171
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:56,654
It's a break-in. You're the lookout.

172
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:57,906
I have eyes.

173
00:12:01,618 --> 00:12:04,037
You know we're doing this
in daylight, right?

174
00:12:05,663 --> 00:12:06,706
What?

175
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,586
Oh, f-- Blanaid's match.

176
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,922
It's her first since Grace.
How'd I forget that?

177
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:16,257
I'm supposed to be there.

178
00:12:16,341 --> 00:12:18,343
Go. It's important.

179
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:19,552
I'll be lookout and--

180
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:21,262
What are you again?

181
00:12:21,346 --> 00:12:22,430
The grown-up.

182
00:12:23,973 --> 00:12:24,807
Be fine.

183
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:27,018
Okay, just--

184
00:12:27,936 --> 00:12:29,520
just don't be shit, all right?

185
00:12:29,604 --> 00:12:30,772
No cock-ups.

186
00:12:31,648 --> 00:12:35,151
You just get in,
and you get out, okay? Leave no trace.

187
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:36,653
We have this.

188
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:38,279
Right?

189
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:53,336
Blanaid.

190
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:55,004
Your new helmet. Look.

191
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:57,257
You got it for me?

192
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,299
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

193
00:12:58,383 --> 00:13:01,052
You couldn't be wearing that old thing.
I mean, it's seen better days.

194
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:01,970
Hey, you.

195
00:13:02,637 --> 00:13:03,763
- How you doing?
- Hey.

196
00:13:04,472 --> 00:13:05,765
Good to see you.

197
00:13:05,848 --> 00:13:07,976
- Thanks for the reminder.
- Yeah. You okay?

198
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:09,811
- Yeah, yeah.
- Good. Coming down?

199
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:11,855
Just see if that one fits a bit better.

200
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:13,565
- Yeah. Yeah. Go. Go.
- Fits perfect.

201
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,027
Now, you just go out and give it socks.

202
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:19,195
Bla, come here.

203
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:21,322
Do your mammy proud.

204
00:13:22,073 --> 00:13:22,907
Thanks.

205
00:13:23,408 --> 00:13:25,159
I was gonna get her one myself.

206
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:27,787
You not at church today?

207
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:29,789
I'll be heading as soon as they throw in.

208
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:32,125
I just wanted to see Blanaid settled.

209
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,210
She's been a bag of nerves all week.

210
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:37,797
Right. Well, her mam just died.

211
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:54,981
Well done!

212
00:13:55,064 --> 00:13:56,816
What you putting in her porridge,
rocket fuel?

213
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:08,036
Go on! Yeah!

214
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:11,206
- Bloody warrior!
- What a score!

215
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:21,716
Watch your back, princess.

216
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:48,826
What are you doing?

217
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,161
Nervous wee.

218
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:56,751
Becka.

219
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:57,835
Sorry.

220
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:00,171
Come on.

221
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:17,480
Angelica is walking
towards the church door,

222
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,442
helping an old lady on a Zimmer frame.

223
00:15:21,526 --> 00:15:23,987
All right, Urs.
I don't need a running commentary.

224
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,280
I thought that was my job.

225
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:30,368
Becka.

226
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:32,078
Coming.

227
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:03,026
Becka.

228
00:16:09,324 --> 00:16:10,325
In you go.

229
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:12,619
You're the smallest.

230
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:15,747
And you're the one I had to bring
to gymnastics every weekend of my teens.

231
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,123
Payback.

232
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:26,925
Didn't you used to win trophies?

233
00:16:27,008 --> 00:16:29,761
Yeah, but I have hips now, so help me.

234
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:33,264
Careful.

235
00:16:33,348 --> 00:16:35,725
- Well, I'm helping!
- My tits are in the sink.

236
00:16:35,808 --> 00:16:37,518
I'll just do it myself.

237
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:38,603
Okay.

238
00:16:43,107 --> 00:16:44,234
Oh, no.

239
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:45,610
Uh-oh. Oh, shit.

240
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:47,987
Are you okay?

241
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:49,572
Yeah.

242
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,160
Referee, foul!

243
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:55,328
Stop her!

244
00:16:56,246 --> 00:16:57,288
What?

245
00:16:57,372 --> 00:16:58,623
Stop her.

246
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,210
A really seasoned
camogie commentary there.

247
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:05,129
Sorry. Get her a fucking saddle, ref.

248
00:17:05,629 --> 00:17:07,048
- Is that better?
- Yeah.

249
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,261
Which one of your family's
gonna die next, huh?

250
00:17:17,892 --> 00:17:19,601
Get off of her. Get off!

251
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:22,397
Break it up!

252
00:17:22,897 --> 00:17:24,648
Oh, Jesus. Bla. What is she doing?

253
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:26,401
Let the coaches deal with it.

254
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,611
Get Off!

255
00:17:28,695 --> 00:17:30,697
Fecking Garveys. All the same.

256
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,615
Hey, no need for that.

257
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:34,075
Break it up!

258
00:17:34,158 --> 00:17:35,577
- What'd he say?
- Don't mind him.

259
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,705
It's GAA, not soccer. Someone should
put some manners on you lot.

260
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:41,833
Someone should put you on your arse,
you culchie prick.

261
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,793
Who the fuck are you… Hey!

262
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:45,837
Nothing to say now?

263
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,422
- Hiding behind your missus?
- Break it up!

264
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:49,924
Blanaid!

265
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:54,304
Oh, God. Molly.

266
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:55,388
Molly!

267
00:17:57,265 --> 00:17:58,474
Break it up!

268
00:17:58,558 --> 00:17:59,893
What did I do?

269
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:02,186
If you hadn't shoved her
in the first place.

270
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,063
Did you hear what she said?

271
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:14,157
Ursula?

272
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,201
Roger. How are you?

273
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,162
You're looking very snazzy.

274
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:20,288
Thank you.

275
00:18:21,122 --> 00:18:22,415
What are you doing here?

276
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:25,627
I was just in, having a pray,

277
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:30,548
and the incense made me feel a bit queasy.

278
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:33,718
I love a bit of incense.

279
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,929
It's how I imagine Jesus smelled.

280
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,976
Well, now you're here,
it feels like a sign, Urs.

281
00:18:43,311 --> 00:18:44,979
Would you like to step out
with me sometime?

282
00:18:48,608 --> 00:18:49,526
I--

283
00:18:50,026 --> 00:18:52,654
I don't think it's me you really
wanna be spending time with.

284
00:18:52,737 --> 00:18:54,531
It's very sweet of you to--

285
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:58,159
It's just, I thought, you know,
since Grace got taken so young,

286
00:18:58,243 --> 00:19:01,037
it got me to thinking that we only
get one go at this, you know?

287
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,833
And let's be honest, are we ever
really gonna find the ideal woman?

288
00:19:09,254 --> 00:19:11,256
Well, probably not.

289
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:12,799
I--

290
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:15,593
- Sorry, right so.
- Yeah.

291
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:19,722
Donal?

292
00:19:20,348 --> 00:19:22,809
Yeah, are you okay?

293
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:25,728
Molly?

294
00:19:25,812 --> 00:19:27,814
Do-- Can you just slow down--

295
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:31,359
Teeth, plural?

296
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:34,571
- Did that gobshite say something?
- Doesn't matter. Let's just go.

297
00:19:34,654 --> 00:19:37,073
Well, whatever she said, you know,
you have to rise above it.

298
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:39,826
When they go high,
you go low, the other way.

299
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:41,619
Says you, showing me up?

300
00:19:41,703 --> 00:19:43,705
That's what everyone
will be talking about now.

301
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:45,665
Like they haven't enough to gossip about.

302
00:19:45,748 --> 00:19:46,833
- Bla.
- Hey.

303
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,460
Why the hell did you
let her take her helmet off?

304
00:19:49,544 --> 00:19:51,045
Seriously, don't even start with me.

305
00:19:51,129 --> 00:19:52,213
Sorry.

306
00:19:52,297 --> 00:19:55,008
Molly, let me see.
Let me see, love. Open. Show me.

307
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:58,177
It's fine.

308
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:00,555
Urs, what are you doing here?
We've got this.

309
00:20:00,638 --> 00:20:03,141
- You've got this? Really?
- No, I mean, you know,

310
00:20:03,224 --> 00:20:05,810
we can take care of Molly
if you've got things you need to be doing.

311
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:08,187
The teeth are hanging out
of her head, Eva.

312
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:09,397
That's my priority.

313
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,815
Jesus, it's obvious you never had kids.

314
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:13,651
Right. And you're mother of the year,
are you, Nurse Jackie?

315
00:20:13,735 --> 00:20:14,944
Let's all just cool the jets here.

316
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:17,155
Says the guy who takes off
first row of his marriage.

317
00:20:17,238 --> 00:20:18,531
Jesus, Urs.

318
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:22,202
Someone actually married her?

319
00:20:23,453 --> 00:20:25,246
Do you think she put Eddie in the ground?

320
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,123
She drove him away first. Look.

321
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:33,838
Left her for another woman.

322
00:20:33,922 --> 00:20:36,174
Bold. I'm starting to feel sorry for her.

323
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:37,258
Don't.

324
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:39,636
She's a hateful, homophobic wagon.

325
00:20:43,431 --> 00:20:44,432
What's that?

326
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:46,017
It's coming from over there.

327
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:03,326
Creepy.

328
00:21:05,912 --> 00:21:07,747
What do you think she keeps them for?

329
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:09,541
Meat?

330
00:21:09,624 --> 00:21:10,917
Company?

331
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,001
"Bunny-lingus"?

332
00:21:18,883 --> 00:21:20,593
We need to get a move on.
You do the bedrooms,

333
00:21:20,677 --> 00:21:21,928
I'll do the sitting room.

334
00:21:22,011 --> 00:21:23,555
That money is in here somewhere.

335
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:30,019
Amen.

336
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:37,068
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

337
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:39,529
Bibi, you need to see this.

338
00:21:42,115 --> 00:21:43,992
Does Angelica have a lodger?

339
00:21:44,075 --> 00:21:45,201
I don't think so.

340
00:21:45,994 --> 00:21:47,203
Does she have a daughter?

341
00:21:48,037 --> 00:21:49,664
A niece maybe?

342
00:21:54,043 --> 00:21:55,670
This is all brand-new stuff.

343
00:22:03,386 --> 00:22:04,804
Bla's school jacket.

344
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,307
Creepy bitch.

345
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,727
This is all for Blanaid.

346
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,770
What the hell is she playing at?

347
00:22:30,997 --> 00:22:31,915
Becka.

348
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:38,338
Rogie?

349
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,012
God. Heaven's sake. How many times?

350
00:22:46,095 --> 00:22:49,933
- Do we live in a flipping barn?
- Oh, sh…

351
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:54,771
Oh, my God.

352
00:22:55,396 --> 00:22:57,148
Oh, for God's sake.

353
00:22:58,233 --> 00:22:59,275
Roger?

354
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,292
There's somebody here. I know it.

355
00:23:23,841 --> 00:23:25,969
Look, I'm after calling the Guards.

356
00:23:33,393 --> 00:23:35,395
You try anything and I'll clatter ya.

357
00:23:50,785 --> 00:23:51,786
Becka.

358
00:23:52,328 --> 00:23:54,163
- Becka!
- Run!

359
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:58,459
Are you all right?

360
00:23:58,543 --> 00:23:59,669
Just go!

361
00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:03,423
- She saw me.
- What?

362
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:05,550
Bollocks.

363
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,051
Over here. Over here.

364
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,306
It's fine. Don't worry.

365
00:24:11,389 --> 00:24:12,223
Shit.

366
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:13,725
We have proof she's a psycho.

367
00:24:13,808 --> 00:24:15,977
I took pictures of Blanaid's bedroom.
And look, I took this.

368
00:24:17,437 --> 00:24:19,689
- What the hell? Why?
- Well, collateral.

369
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:21,566
You've taken a bunny hostage.

370
00:24:22,734 --> 00:24:23,860
Take it out of there!

371
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:27,030
- Bugger bit me.
- Shit! Shit.

372
00:24:27,113 --> 00:24:29,032
- Oh, my God. Where has it gone?
- Bibi!

373
00:24:31,576 --> 00:24:32,493
How was Wicklow?

374
00:24:32,994 --> 00:24:34,078
Anything useful?

375
00:24:34,162 --> 00:24:35,330
Sir, very.

376
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,333
So, I had a good look around
John Paul Williams's cabin

377
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:39,792
and a chat with the locals.

378
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:41,461
Go on.

379
00:24:41,544 --> 00:24:45,548
Well, it's so remote, there's only
so many places to look, so I did.

380
00:24:45,632 --> 00:24:47,842
And guess what?

381
00:24:48,468 --> 00:24:50,303
All the Garveys-- bar Grace--

382
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:53,848
stayed in a hotel a mile away from
the murder scene the night John Paul died.

383
00:24:53,932 --> 00:24:55,850
They're in on it, a hundred percent.

384
00:24:55,934 --> 00:24:58,228
I mean, there's no way that Grace
could have done all the, you know…

385
00:24:59,604 --> 00:25:00,605
alone.

386
00:25:01,189 --> 00:25:03,775
Yeah, without proof or a confession,

387
00:25:03,858 --> 00:25:05,151
I mean, we can't charge them.

388
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:06,444
So long as they keep their mouths shut

389
00:25:06,528 --> 00:25:08,780
- they're safe.
- Yeah, but they're springing leaks, sir.

390
00:25:08,863 --> 00:25:11,282
Grace lies to us. Next thing, dead.

391
00:25:11,366 --> 00:25:13,326
Any time we're there, they wobble.

392
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:14,410
Houlihan.

393
00:25:15,245 --> 00:25:16,579
Yeah. I'll be right back, sir.

394
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,515
Sir. Sir.

395
00:25:35,598 --> 00:25:37,225
Becka Garvey's
given us a reason to nab her.

396
00:25:39,185 --> 00:25:40,186
Okay.

397
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:45,900
Where's Urs?

398
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,486
She's at the hospital.
She's fine. She's with Molly.

399
00:25:48,987 --> 00:25:50,488
She got a whack, a hurl.

400
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:53,241
Ian, do you mind?

401
00:25:55,034 --> 00:25:55,869
Sure.

402
00:25:55,952 --> 00:25:56,953
No, stay.

403
00:25:57,579 --> 00:25:58,621
He should know.

404
00:25:59,747 --> 00:26:03,167
We found out Grace was being
blackmailed by Angelica.

405
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:04,961
- What?
- We didn't find the money.

406
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,754
She came back.

407
00:26:07,422 --> 00:26:09,591
- I might have knocked her over.
- Jesus.

408
00:26:10,091 --> 00:26:11,342
Well, you said he should stay.

409
00:26:11,426 --> 00:26:13,219
Yeah, but I didn't know
you messed up, did I?

410
00:26:13,303 --> 00:26:15,179
You broke into her house?

411
00:26:15,263 --> 00:26:17,348
Jesus, lads, have you lost your minds?

412
00:26:17,432 --> 00:26:21,769
We couldn't tell the cops.
She knows about JP.

413
00:26:21,853 --> 00:26:23,146
Grace must have told her.

414
00:26:23,646 --> 00:26:25,607
Or Roger. I don't know.

415
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,151
- She's targeting Blanaid.
- What does that mean?

416
00:26:28,234 --> 00:26:30,820
We found this in a room
she's made up for her.

417
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:32,280
You should have seen the room.

418
00:26:32,363 --> 00:26:33,823
It looked like a Barbie prison cell.

419
00:26:42,624 --> 00:26:44,125
Sorry to intrude.

420
00:26:44,751 --> 00:26:46,002
Excuse me.

421
00:26:46,085 --> 00:26:47,212
All the gang.

422
00:26:48,046 --> 00:26:51,507
- Becka Garvey, we're arresting you.
- What? Arresting her for what?

423
00:26:51,591 --> 00:26:54,260
Burglary and assault
of Mrs. Angelica Collins.

424
00:26:54,344 --> 00:26:55,637
You're not obliged to say anything,
unless…

425
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,263
- Get your hands off her.
- Calm down.

426
00:26:57,347 --> 00:26:59,390
But anything you do say
will be taken down in writing

427
00:26:59,474 --> 00:27:00,975
and may be given in evidence.

428
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:02,602
This is harassment.

429
00:27:02,685 --> 00:27:04,145
We just lost our sister.

430
00:27:05,104 --> 00:27:06,397
She's done nothing wrong.

431
00:27:22,956 --> 00:27:23,957
What's taking so long?

432
00:27:24,582 --> 00:27:27,085
We were reviewing the victim's complaint.

433
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:30,004
These are very serious allegations.

434
00:27:30,922 --> 00:27:32,507
You sure you don't want that solicitor?

435
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,512
You broke in when she was at Mass.

436
00:27:39,222 --> 00:27:40,598
You stole property.

437
00:27:42,183 --> 00:27:43,184
No comment.

438
00:27:43,685 --> 00:27:45,186
You assaulted her.

439
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,771
That's not true.

440
00:27:46,855 --> 00:27:48,982
You know, you could get
18 months for that alone.

441
00:27:51,442 --> 00:27:53,027
Why would you break into her house?

442
00:27:53,653 --> 00:27:54,737
What were you looking for?

443
00:27:55,488 --> 00:27:57,949
Did Grace talk to her about JP?

444
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:02,704
Maybe Angelica just knew
too much about the past,

445
00:28:03,288 --> 00:28:04,372
about what you all did.

446
00:28:10,962 --> 00:28:12,297
Can I get something to eat?

447
00:28:13,631 --> 00:28:14,841
I feel a little…

448
00:28:16,384 --> 00:28:20,555
Can I just get a sandwich
or anything white?

449
00:28:22,265 --> 00:28:24,684
Come in, Roger, for goodness' sake.

450
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:25,894
You decent?

451
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:28,688
Wee cup of tea here. Two sugars.

452
00:28:29,898 --> 00:28:32,275
Now you want my teeth to rot too?

453
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:34,777
See you got your old neck brace out.

454
00:28:41,492 --> 00:28:44,245
I just don't know
what I did to deserve this.

455
00:28:46,331 --> 00:28:48,499
I'm kind to a fault.

456
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:53,630
And you got involved with those people?

457
00:28:55,089 --> 00:28:59,844
You just got caught up in murder
and I'm paying the price.

458
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,848
Maybe you're next.

459
00:29:03,932 --> 00:29:07,518
What? No.
They only hit out to protect each other.

460
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:09,979
Sure, look, they tried
to save Grace from him.

461
00:29:10,063 --> 00:29:13,942
JP done some wicked things
and not just to his wife.

462
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:16,653
What are you talking about? What things?

463
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:20,448
Roger.

464
00:29:21,574 --> 00:29:22,575
Grace said…

465
00:29:24,452 --> 00:29:25,495
She said that…

466
00:29:28,122 --> 00:29:29,415
he raped Eva.

467
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:31,543
And he told her.

468
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:32,752
And he taunted her.

469
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:35,547
And she, well…

470
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:55,567
This is just about the break-in, isn't it?

471
00:29:56,192 --> 00:29:57,819
Angelica's not gonna
throw us all under the bus.

472
00:29:58,403 --> 00:30:00,530
Guards have to say
why they're arresting you.

473
00:30:01,155 --> 00:30:02,699
Your one said assault and burglary, so--

474
00:30:02,782 --> 00:30:04,367
We can't just sit here, you know?

475
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,662
We need to do something,
like go to the Garda station, or--

476
00:30:07,745 --> 00:30:09,873
Garda stations aren't hospitals.
There's no waiting room.

477
00:30:09,956 --> 00:30:11,291
You don't just show up.

478
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:13,084
Don't give them an excuse
to drag us in too.

479
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:15,628
Seriously, what are we gonna do
to get Becka out?

480
00:30:16,337 --> 00:30:18,423
Do we go round to Angelica's?
Make her drop the charges?

481
00:30:18,506 --> 00:30:20,675
No, we do not do that.
That's intimidating the victim.

482
00:30:20,758 --> 00:30:21,843
That's only gonna make it worse.

483
00:30:21,926 --> 00:30:23,553
Well, then we invite her around here.

484
00:30:25,054 --> 00:30:27,098
We are not calling that wagon.

485
00:30:27,181 --> 00:30:28,016
Just…

486
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,478
Wha-- I will not be in the same room
as that blackmailing bitch.

487
00:30:40,653 --> 00:30:41,529
What's in it?

488
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,240
Camembert and watercress.

489
00:30:45,325 --> 00:30:47,285
I'm joking, obviously. It's egg mayo.

490
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:51,331
I bet you they'll do a good club sandwich
at the Wicklow Lodge.

491
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,544
Place you stayed the night
John Paul Williams was murdered.

492
00:30:57,879 --> 00:30:59,255
We know you were all there.

493
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:01,341
We have the booking.

494
00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:06,429
Is that why you roughed Angelica up?

495
00:31:08,181 --> 00:31:10,725
Because she worked out
you were all involved in JP's death?

496
00:31:30,995 --> 00:31:32,121
Angelica.

497
00:31:33,665 --> 00:31:34,666
Take a seat.

498
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:43,591
Here, let me give you--

499
00:31:43,675 --> 00:31:44,801
There you go.

500
00:31:44,884 --> 00:31:45,969
Is that real?

501
00:31:46,052 --> 00:31:47,053
Yes.

502
00:31:49,222 --> 00:31:51,057
I would take a glass of water.

503
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,684
Yes, sure. I'll get that.

504
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:54,477
- Must be.
- I don't know.

505
00:31:54,561 --> 00:31:55,645
Thanks for coming.

506
00:31:56,145 --> 00:32:00,692
Well, I wasn't going to, but you sounded
up to high doh when you rang,

507
00:32:00,775 --> 00:32:02,443
and I'm not one to hold a grudge.

508
00:32:02,527 --> 00:32:06,155
- Well, we appreciate your--
- And Roger knows where I am.

509
00:32:10,243 --> 00:32:12,704
We're here to talk about Becka, obviously.

510
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:15,957
What she did was wrong.

511
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:17,750
We know that.

512
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:19,210
She's a monkey.

513
00:32:21,212 --> 00:32:24,090
But we'd like to ask you
to withdraw your complaint.

514
00:32:25,425 --> 00:32:28,928
Becka crossed a line
when she came into my house.

515
00:32:31,681 --> 00:32:33,099
Caused a lot of damage.

516
00:32:33,182 --> 00:32:35,018
Sorry, what damage?

517
00:32:35,101 --> 00:32:37,186
She could go down for assaulting me.

518
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:40,106
And you could go down
for attempting to groom schoolgirls.

519
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,525
If by grooming
you mean looking out for the child--

520
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:45,153
- Well, she doesn't need you to.
- Bibi, can we…

521
00:32:47,113 --> 00:32:48,865
We'd like you to forgive Becka.

522
00:32:50,158 --> 00:32:51,034
Why should I?

523
00:32:51,117 --> 00:32:53,870
- It's what Jesus would do.
- It's what Grace would have done.

524
00:32:53,953 --> 00:32:59,500
And, we've already lost one sister.
We don't wanna lose another.

525
00:33:01,461 --> 00:33:05,089
And maybe we could
give you something in return?

526
00:33:06,966 --> 00:33:07,967
Money?

527
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,511
Is that all you think I'm interested in?

528
00:33:22,857 --> 00:33:26,069
I wish I'd been able
to say goodbye properly.

529
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:36,746
I would like…

530
00:33:38,831 --> 00:33:41,167
to scatter Grace's ashes.

531
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:44,045
- You what? You want to what?
- Absolutely not.

532
00:33:44,128 --> 00:33:46,214
- We're not gonna give you her ashes.
- Absolutely not. No way.

533
00:33:46,297 --> 00:33:48,216
You were at the funeral.
Isn't that enough?

534
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,426
But no grave to mourn at.

535
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:54,931
You know, 6 foot from her head
to her feet is all she needed,

536
00:33:55,014 --> 00:33:56,724
and you went and you burned her instead.

537
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,980
So, what do you say, girls?

538
00:34:04,482 --> 00:34:07,026
Baby Becka out or not?

539
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:22,041
Interview paused.
DI Loftus leaving the room.

540
00:34:27,881 --> 00:34:30,550
We have bar receipts too, by the way.

541
00:34:32,427 --> 00:34:35,013
It's a lot of Jägerbombs
for a school night.

542
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,765
Celebrating, were youse?

543
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:40,142
Or steeling yourselves?

544
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:46,274
It's ten years to life
for accessory to murder, Becka.

545
00:34:46,356 --> 00:34:49,485
- You might wanna start talking.
- Why are you trying to pin this on us?

546
00:34:50,612 --> 00:34:52,863
You haven't even found answers
for Grace's death.

547
00:34:52,947 --> 00:34:54,865
I mean, where was she going
the night she died?

548
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,534
Why did she take all that money out?

549
00:34:58,036 --> 00:35:00,955
What money? What money, Becka?

550
00:35:03,124 --> 00:35:04,751
- Detective.
- What money?

551
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:06,794
- Detective. Outside.
- What?

552
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:30,902
- Come here.
- I'm sorry.

553
00:35:30,985 --> 00:35:32,445
- Come here.
- I'm sorry.

554
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:33,530
It's okay.

555
00:35:34,614 --> 00:35:35,990
It's okay.

556
00:35:36,074 --> 00:35:38,743
Come on. Let's go.

557
00:35:39,452 --> 00:35:40,578
What happened?

558
00:35:41,412 --> 00:35:42,664
Why did Angelica drop the complaint?

559
00:35:42,747 --> 00:35:44,874
We just came to an arrangement with her.

560
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:46,626
What kind of an arrangement?

561
00:35:47,752 --> 00:35:51,339
We said we'd let her scatter
Grace's ashes if she helped you.

562
00:35:51,422 --> 00:35:54,634
- Oh, my God. Eva.
- We're not gonna actually do it, okay?

563
00:35:55,468 --> 00:35:57,178
The main thing is, you're off the hook.

564
00:35:57,262 --> 00:35:59,097
- It's gonna be all right.
- It's not.

565
00:35:59,597 --> 00:36:01,057
We're all under investigation.

566
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,101
They wanna do us for accessory to murder.

567
00:36:03,184 --> 00:36:04,769
They-- What?

568
00:36:07,105 --> 00:36:08,231
They said that?

569
00:36:08,982 --> 00:36:10,400
It's ten years to life.

570
00:36:12,193 --> 00:36:14,696
Well, we're not accessories
to murder, are we?

571
00:36:14,779 --> 00:36:16,573
- I mean, if anything--
- And I'm pregnant.

572
00:36:19,158 --> 00:36:20,952
Jesus, Becka. Are you serious?

573
00:36:23,538 --> 00:36:24,664
Yeah.

574
00:36:27,792 --> 00:36:30,837
Are you all right? I mean--
How far gone? Does Joe know?

575
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,922
No. I don't want anyone to know.

576
00:36:36,509 --> 00:36:38,094
Okay, look, sorry. I'm just--

577
00:36:39,012 --> 00:36:41,639
Oh, God. Shit. Okay. Okay.

578
00:36:42,974 --> 00:36:44,601
I need to get out. I need some air.

579
00:36:44,684 --> 00:36:45,685
Becka?

580
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:48,521
Becka? You can't just--

581
00:36:50,899 --> 00:36:51,900
Becka.

582
00:37:19,969 --> 00:37:21,095
Becka.

583
00:37:22,138 --> 00:37:23,431
Hey, what's wrong?

584
00:37:26,601 --> 00:37:27,727
I don't wanna talk.

585
00:37:32,774 --> 00:37:33,691
Mario Kart?

586
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:08,560
- You wanna stop?
- No.

587
00:38:09,561 --> 00:38:10,645
Yeah.

588
00:38:14,983 --> 00:38:16,276
I have to tell you something.

589
00:38:21,072 --> 00:38:22,323
Can we lie down for a bit?

590
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:28,246
I didn't mean to drag you back
into our shit.

591
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:30,039
Just…

592
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:33,501
seeing your face and…

593
00:38:35,753 --> 00:38:37,130
hearing your voice…

594
00:38:40,258 --> 00:38:41,759
just brings it all back.

595
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,471
All of that trauma.

596
00:38:45,555 --> 00:38:47,849
How you make me feel, you idiot.

597
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,353
You know, I got over you.

598
00:38:54,022 --> 00:38:55,857
Took me a long time, but I did.

599
00:38:57,066 --> 00:38:58,401
I got over you too.

600
00:39:01,613 --> 00:39:05,366
Then I'd have a dark day and I'd think,

601
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,785
"Well, he's the only one
who would understand this."

602
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:15,084
I don't have to explain myself to you.

603
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,671
You just know.

604
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,721
I know that you wreck my head.

605
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,019
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have come here.

606
00:39:33,102 --> 00:39:36,231
It's not your problem.
I just didn't know where else to go.

607
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:37,690
It's fine.

608
00:39:39,484 --> 00:39:41,486
Jesus. I'm glad you did.

609
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:47,325
Look, if the Guards were able
to charge you, they would have.

610
00:39:47,825 --> 00:39:49,285
They don't have any evidence.

611
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:51,621
You just need to stay calm, close ranks.

612
00:39:51,704 --> 00:39:54,749
Don't give them another reason
to drag you in.

613
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,043
What about Angelica?

614
00:39:58,086 --> 00:39:59,462
She's been to the Guards once.

615
00:39:59,546 --> 00:40:01,965
I mean, what if
she just decides to tell them everything?

616
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,467
She won't. She's had her chance.

617
00:40:06,761 --> 00:40:08,096
It's gonna be okay.

618
00:40:09,013 --> 00:40:11,224
Come here. It's gonna be fine.

619
00:40:13,518 --> 00:40:14,519
I promise.

620
00:40:24,362 --> 00:40:25,363
Becka.

621
00:40:30,326 --> 00:40:31,327
Becka, wait.

622
00:40:31,953 --> 00:40:34,706
Jesus Christ. Don't run away, like,
what are you, ten?

623
00:40:36,374 --> 00:40:38,918
What the hell? Are you serious?

624
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:40,044
You followed me?

625
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:41,671
No, I didn't follow you. I--

626
00:40:41,754 --> 00:40:43,548
You didn't answer any of my calls.

627
00:40:44,507 --> 00:40:46,217
I looked you up, by the way,

628
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:48,720
and your band should have stuck
with insurance.

629
00:40:48,803 --> 00:40:49,888
What?

630
00:40:50,471 --> 00:40:51,890
I knew it. I knew it.

631
00:40:51,973 --> 00:40:54,142
The way you looked at each other
at the funeral.

632
00:40:54,225 --> 00:40:56,185
You've been cheating on me
with zero-craic Ken here.

633
00:40:56,269 --> 00:40:58,021
- Do you wanna keep it down a bit?
- No, that's--

634
00:40:58,104 --> 00:41:01,399
So, what have you been doing then?
Listening to his shitty demos?

635
00:41:01,482 --> 00:41:02,859
Why do you keep slagging off my band?

636
00:41:02,942 --> 00:41:04,319
I'll give you two guesses.

637
00:41:05,278 --> 00:41:07,488
We just talked. I swear.

638
00:41:09,657 --> 00:41:11,117
You told me you love me.

639
00:41:12,702 --> 00:41:15,121
Don't tell me now that
that didn't mean anything.

640
00:41:17,665 --> 00:41:22,503
Can you just give me some space, please?

641
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:24,172
For a bit, Joe.

642
00:41:24,255 --> 00:41:25,757
What, so he can step in?

643
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,384
I'm not going anywhere.
I wanna stay. I wanna fight for us.

644
00:41:28,468 --> 00:41:29,594
Yeah, buddy. Fight, fight, fight.

645
00:41:29,677 --> 00:41:31,679
Here, mate.
Do you wanna shut up, you dope?

646
00:41:31,763 --> 00:41:33,264
Becka, call me when you're ready.

647
00:41:33,348 --> 00:41:34,766
Seriously, man, I will lamp you.

648
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:36,184
I will lamp you back.

649
00:41:36,267 --> 00:41:38,228
I can't do this anymore, Joe.

650
00:41:42,899 --> 00:41:43,942
Sorry.

651
00:41:45,735 --> 00:41:46,819
I'm sorry.

652
00:41:56,955 --> 00:42:00,333
- That was just beautiful.
- Thank you. Thank you.

653
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:03,378
Good night, lads. See you tomorrow.

654
00:42:08,424 --> 00:42:10,677
- Night. Take care.
- Good night.

655
00:42:12,262 --> 00:42:13,388
Hello, Angelica.

656
00:42:17,976 --> 00:42:18,977
Hello.

657
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,770
What are you doing here?

658
00:42:23,147 --> 00:42:24,732
That brother of yours not with you?

659
00:42:24,816 --> 00:42:27,193
No, he is not. Why do you ask?

660
00:42:27,944 --> 00:42:29,863
Stay away from the Garveys, you hear?

661
00:42:32,365 --> 00:42:33,616
From the sisters.

662
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,201
I could say the same to you.

663
00:42:39,038 --> 00:42:42,333
You're sick in the head, you know that?

664
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,171
And stay away from Blanaid too,
from all of us.

665
00:42:49,591 --> 00:42:50,884
Last time I'll tell you.
