00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,821
<i>This is Ian Reilly.
Leave a message, I'll get back to you.</i>

2
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,031
Ian.

3
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,556
Oh, my God.

4
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,251
Happy retirement. Hang up your handcuffs.

5
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,504
Bit kinky, sir.

6
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,798
No, thanks.

7
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,508
I wasn't offering.

8
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,218
It's my piece.

9
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,803
This came for you.

10
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,530
Yeah? Yeah, Loftus.

11
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,273
My God.

12
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:25,722
Hi, sorry.

13
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:29,721
I'm just checking that Blanaid Williams
turned up for camogie this morning.

14
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,522
Okay. Thank you.

15
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,853
I... She was at a sleepover and...

16
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,730
Okay, bye.

17
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,662
<i>This is Ian Reilly.
Leave a message, I'll get back to you.</i>

18
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,702
He's blocked me. He's fucking blocked me.

19
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,747
Shit.

20
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,087
Oh, fuck.

21
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,470
- What?
- <i>Where are you?</i>

22
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,884
It doesn't matter. What's wrong?

23
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,845
<i>We have a problem.</i>

24
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,864
All my sisters have been arrested.

25
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:24,948
That's unfortunate.

26
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,201
I just... Can you tell me
why they've been brought in?

27
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,452
What are your sisters called?

28
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,365
- Garvey.
- Garvey?

29
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,701
Oh, yeah, I remember you.

30
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,369
Take a seat.

31
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,084
No, I just... No, I need to...

32
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,670
Look, can I speak
to Detective Loftus, please?

33
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,208
Can you take a seat please, madam?

34
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,341
Madam.

35
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:53,847
And?

36
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,189
And? How do you mean "and"?

37
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,024
I mean, your point is?

38
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,902
- Angelica Collins is missing.
- That's news to me.

39
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,776
So my point is,
it doesn't look very good, does it?

40
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,739
I haven't got my glasses. Sorry.

41
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:21,839
Is it the marina?

42
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,962
Yeah, I know it's the marina.

43
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,302
Why were you there?

44
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,799
Why were we there?

45
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,515
Why were we there?

46
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,642
Do you mean, like,
was it business or pleasure?

47
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,686
'Cause I'd say it was a bit of both.

48
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:39,893
The footage was sent in anonymously,
so someone knows why you were there.

49
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,313
Or someone's trying to set us up.

50
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,362
Are you sure that's legit?

51
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,115
Your sister Eva was in here that day

52
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,409
telling us that Angelica
had threatened Grace,

53
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,162
so it makes sense
why you'd want to talk to her.

54
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,663
Did it just go too far?

55
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,999
Did Mr. Reilly get involved?
Because we know that he's--

56
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,418
- A word, Detective Houlihan.
- Not now.

57
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,331
- No, now, please.
- I'll come and find you later.

58
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,794
Detective Houlihan, outside, now.

59
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,771
Why are all the Garveys here?

60
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,275
Because I have video evidence of them
taking Angelica Collins out on a boat

61
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,903
and coming back without her.
I think they killed her.

62
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,238
Only a couple of days back,
you wanted to haul in Ian Reilly.

63
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,949
- Yes, well, it's all connected, isn't it?
- That's good to know.

64
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,279
Angelica Collins has been found.

65
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,329
Her body's been found?

66
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,533
Her body.

67
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:37,831
Her head.

68
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,036
All of her.

69
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,165
Jesus. Alive.

70
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:47,049
And you don't just round up people
you suspect of murder on a whim.

71
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,342
Do you understand me?

72
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,637
- Everything you do, it goes through me.
- Yeah, with respect, sir,

73
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,722
- I have tried to contact you.
- A missing woman found.

74
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,636
Money found.

75
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,393
There is nothing here.
You're chasing nothing.

76
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,812
- Grace Reilly shouldn't have--
- Grace Reilly knew we were onto her

77
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,936
and was clearly making a run for it
with 20 grand in her pocket.

78
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,569
So you go back to the family, you tell
them we found the money in the car.

79
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,858
You give it back to them,
and then you leave them alone.

80
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,158
This investigation is closed.
Do you hear me?

81
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,114
Don't need your bullshit on my last day.

82
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,889
Thank you for your service.

83
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,368
What about you, Sis?

84
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,622
I heard you got to go up in a helicopter.

85
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,630
Very happy to see that face.

86
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,645
<i>That woman must have nine lives.</i>

87
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,398
She'll tell the Guards now
it was an accident, right? Angelica.

88
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,525
We don't know what the mad bitch will say.

89
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,063
Yeah.

90
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:32,863
Why did Grace have
all that money in her car, lads?

91
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,532
She wouldn't have been legging it
from the cops, would she?

92
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,909
She wouldn't leave Bla behind.

93
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,744
She wasn't thinking straight, I know that.

94
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,038
You don't know anything.

95
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:45,162
Well, Houlihan was sent that CCTV
footage from the house at the marina.

96
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,790
- What?
- I thought Ian sorted that?

97
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,375
Where is he now?

98
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:56,423
- Eva.
- Eva, where are you going?

99
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,176
I thought she was gonna give us a lift.

100
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:01,803
Perfect.

101
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,235
Oh, shit!

102
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,030
What are you doing?
The... Children crossing.

103
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,492
Fuck off.

104
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,379
I need to check
Blanaid Williams's account.

105
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,965
I'm her aunt, her guardian.
I came in the other day.

106
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:34,795
I need to check her account, please.

107
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,505
Can I see your ID?

108
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,674
Yes.

109
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,927
Sorry. Shit.

110
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,137
Oh, fuck.

111
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:03,078
That account is empty.
A transfer was made yesterday, actually.

112
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,122
What do you mean a transfer was made?

113
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:06,832
Moved to another account.

114
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:09,710
No, I know what a transfer means.
I used to be a bloody finance manager.

115
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,456
But how can that have--

116
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,381
how can that ha...
I haven't even handed in the forms yet.

117
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,799
It's over a hundred grand. Look...

118
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,427
Look, can I just speak to someone just...

119
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:21,008
just someone older, more experienced?
Thank you.

120
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,024
- Oh, God, you're not...
- Miss Garvey,

121
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:35,981
Blanaid's other trustee came in yesterday
and moved the money to a new account.

122
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,524
No.

123
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,823
No, how could that have happened?

124
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,034
You should have done checks on him.

125
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:46,413
And surely you should have had just
some sort of better system in place that...

126
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,243
Is this your signature?

127
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,372
Yeah, but that doesn't just...

128
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,590
Surely that doesn't mean
he can just take all of her money.

129
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,135
The gentleman was on the account
and had the proper documentation.

130
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,721
And he didn't take it, he moved it.

131
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,432
- Shit.
- Everything done was authorized

132
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,429
first by you and then by us.

133
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,018
Are you okay, madam?

134
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:15,812
Do you want to take a seat?

135
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:17,773
Yeah.

136
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,782
Oh, shit.

137
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,116
Where were you?

138
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,577
You need to talk to us, Eva.

139
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,543
- No, Eva, don't. Stop.
- Please don't. Just...

140
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,049
She's scaring me.

141
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,845
It's not even chilled.

142
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,389
Did Ian call the cops on us?

143
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:39,985
I think so, yeah.

144
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,356
Are you shitting me?

145
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,025
Where is he?

146
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,449
- He's gone.
- He's gone where?

147
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,034
Will you all just sit down?

148
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,363
Please, just...

149
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,789
- I don't know where he's gone.
- I knew it.

150
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,328
He's just gone.

151
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,164
There's no sign of him at Grace's.

152
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,792
And he's cleaned out Blanaid's account.

153
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,301
What are you talking about? How? How?

154
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:06,220
I thought I was protecting her.

155
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,424
He said...

156
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:12,851
I made him a co-trustee.
I signed some fucking bank transfer forms.

157
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,849
- What do you mean?
- I mean he played us.

158
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,809
Me.

159
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:21,443
- He played me.
- Oh, God, Eva.

160
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,904
Sorry, I am beyond rage.
How could you be such a--

161
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,818
Stupid dumb bitch? I don't know.

162
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,578
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the Guards.

163
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,992
You can't bring the Guards into this.

164
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,208
He knows everything.

165
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,710
We'll be the criminals.
He'll get custody of Blanaid.

166
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,256
That man no more wants custody of Blanaid...

167
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:43,794
Oh, Jesus Christ.

168
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:50,430
Grace must have found out
that he was just using her too.

169
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,469
You think what happened to Grace
was Ian's fault?

170
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,348
Yeah.

171
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:58,850
Yes.

172
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,355
That's what she needed my help with.

173
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,067
The money she got out was for him.

174
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,198
Oh, God.

175
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:14,997
Angelica's innocent.

176
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:18,245
I didn't think this could get any worse.
I feel sick.

177
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,044
We need to go talk to Angelica.

178
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,589
We need to say sorry
and to explain it was an accident.

179
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,258
Seriously, the last thing we need now
is her pressing charges,

180
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,754
- but bagsy not me.
- Bagsy not me.

181
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,675
I'll go then.

182
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,344
I think she likes me.

183
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,348
If not best, then not least.

184
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,561
You, go get Ian.

185
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,438
Get Bla's money back.

186
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,648
Find the fucker.

187
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,484
He's blocked me.

188
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,363
Can you talk to Joe?

189
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:55,162
He spent time with him.

190
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,456
See if he knows anything
that can help us find him.

191
00:16:57,476 --> 00:17:00,704
And you, lay off the lady petrol.

192
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,837
Okay? The last thing you need right now
is to fuel your anger.

193
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,042
You're wrong.

194
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,209
That's exactly what I need to do.

195
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,868
- Roger.
- Hey, you.

196
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,663
No, no. I... I've-I've-I've just brought you
some Maltesers.

197
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:38,789
And...

198
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,291
- that actually... that cancels the alarm.
- Roger.

199
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,043
- Roger.
- Angelica, I just--

200
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,670
- Shit.
- No, hang on. I--

201
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,048
- I think you should leave.
- Please just let me explain.

202
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:51,254
She remembers getting on a boat
with you lot and then nothing.

203
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,215
It was an accident.

204
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:56,473
The boom hit you.
Got you a right old wallop.

205
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,433
Becka almost drowned trying to find you.

206
00:17:58,453 --> 00:17:59,763
We thought you were...

207
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:01,807
So glad you're alive.

208
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,268
Miracle.

209
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:08,235
We couldn't do this on purpose.
You know that, don't you?

210
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,945
You know us, Roger.

211
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,775
Why didn't you say anything?

212
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,027
Ian convinced us not to.

213
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,114
He said that we'd get done for murder.

214
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:23,996
I'm sorry. It's no excuse,
but we were scared for Bla.

215
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:27,666
Scared for ourselves, if I'm to be honest.

216
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:32,671
He's pulled the wool over our eyes,
Roger, and now he's gone.

217
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:37,551
You told me you knew nothing,
and I'll not forgive you for that.

218
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:44,516
Now we'd like to be alone,
so could you go now, please?

219
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,194
Are you all right?

220
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,240
Can I get you anything?

221
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:05,250
And is she capable of
having a conversation, do you think?

222
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,496
Oh, shite.

223
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:11,715
It's just important
that we talk to her as soon as possible.

224
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,128
Oh, come on.

225
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:18,342
Hey.

226
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,138
What are you doing here?

227
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:26,855
Intimidating a witness is a serious crime.

228
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,857
I was bringing her Maltesers.

229
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:31,318
You can't intimidate somebody
with Maltesers.

230
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,945
Well, I'll talk with Mrs. Collins.

231
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:34,696
Hear her version of events.

232
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,735
Pretty sure we'll be speaking again soon.

233
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:41,740
Fuck.

234
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,042
Jesus Christ.

235
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,053
Fancy a game?

236
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,181
No, I think I'm done
playing games with you.

237
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:12,646
I need your help, Joe.

238
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,114
Are you serious?
You came to ask for my help?

239
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:19,111
Not to explain yourself, no?

240
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,536
- Explain myself?
- Yes, Becka.

241
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,997
Explain what happened with you
and Billy Bassist.

242
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:27,249
Explain why you never told me
you were fecking pregnant.

243
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,746
I didn't tell you 'cause
I was gonna get a termination.

244
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,293
Sorry, I wasn't gonna tell you that.

245
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:38,297
Definitely not like this.

246
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,509
You weren't gonna tell me?

247
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:45,559
Like, that you were pregnant,
or you were gonna terminate our pregnancy?

248
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:46,810
My pregnancy.

249
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,348
Our pregnancy, Becka.

250
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,022
'Cause you're not an onion, okay?

251
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:51,690
You might think you're God's gift
or whatever,

252
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,066
but you can't actually self-sprout.

253
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,735
Self-sprout?

254
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,695
I don't even know why I'm assuming
it's my baby anyway.

255
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:58,030
Who else's would it be?

256
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,616
When it comes to you, Becka,
who the fuck knows?

257
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:01,987
It could have been his.

258
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,453
Now keep it calm there, both of ya.

259
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:06,330
I'd tell you to shove
your cue up your hole,

260
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,874
but you'd probably miss
'cause you're shit at pool.

261
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:12,336
God, no, no. Not my pool skills.

262
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:15,464
Your breath stinks
in the morning. Like, foul.

263
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:18,837
Oh, well, it didn't stop you trying to get
your leg over every five minutes, did it?

264
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:22,930
- No wonder I ended up in this mess!
- No, Becka. I ended up in the mess.

265
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,389
Jesus!

266
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,432
Oh, fuck's...

267
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,804
Okay, that's it! Out! Both of you.

268
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,974
Jesus fucking God.

269
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,065
Joe!

270
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:34,441
Oh, God. Sorry.

271
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,980
- Watch out.
- Sorry.

272
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:39,696
Will you slow down, please?

273
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,694
You said you were gonna have
a termination, so you haven't yet?

274
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,405
No, I'm not going to.

275
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,788
What? So what?
You're gonna raise the baby with him?

276
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:50,374
- Joe, no.
- Look, he's got amazing eyes. I get that.

277
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:51,750
But are eyes enough?

278
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,252
You know, one day he's gonna get older

279
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:55,712
and they'll get all milky and cloudy
and they won't look amazing.

280
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,214
I don't care about his eyes.

281
00:21:57,234 --> 00:22:00,671
Well, you're not gonna tell me
it's his personality or his talent?

282
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:03,720
Oh, my God.

283
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,598
You frustrate me so fucking much, Becka.

284
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,642
You don't even realize what we have.

285
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:09,893
Like, what this is.

286
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:12,271
When we're laughing
at the same stupid thing.

287
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,142
When we're close, like, when we're just...

288
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:19,319
we're just comfortable
breathing the same air.

289
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,280
You know, that's actually worth something.

290
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,693
Joe, I...

291
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:26,618
Joe, will you just stop walking?

292
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:28,657
What do you want? Like, what?

293
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:31,910
Look, I'm sorry.

294
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:36,206
I'm sorry for the secrets
and for shutting you out and...

295
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:38,672
It's just what my lot do.

296
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:42,254
So why'd you ask for my help earlier, huh?
What was that all about?

297
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:44,923
Ian.

298
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:47,718
He's done a runner.

299
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,933
He lied to Grace.

300
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:53,270
He shagged Eva and left.

301
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,058
He stole all of Blanaid's money.

302
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,228
He's a Dirty John
or a con man or whatever.

303
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:00,564
Jesus, Becka.

304
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,818
You Garveys really know
how to pick a prick.

305
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:08,155
But it's not my problem.

306
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:10,616
God.

307
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:16,163
Just a little bit of pressure.

308
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:22,252
Now lean forward.

309
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:26,298
I'm sorry about
what happened to you, Mrs. Collins.

310
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:28,680
Do you wanna tell me what you remember?

311
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,718
There you are.

312
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:36,522
If you make a complaint
about the Garvey sisters,

313
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:39,394
about what they did to you,
I'll have it dealt with.

314
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:42,272
You can tell me what happened.

315
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:49,529
Jonah spent three days in the whale.

316
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:53,784
I spent three hours in the water.

317
00:23:56,061 --> 00:24:01,667
A small miracle in comparison,
but a miracle all the same.

318
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:05,504
Yeah.

319
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,134
It's always grapes or Maltesers, isn't it?

320
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,096
Grace...

321
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:18,141
would have baked me a cake.

322
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:22,151
She baked for the entire group.

323
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:23,355
Your bereavement group?

324
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:28,568
We both knew grief.
That's how we became friends.

325
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,700
And then Ian came along,
just changed everything.

326
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,955
Ian was grieving his sister, right?

327
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,166
I don't think he was.

328
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:46,628
You don't think he had a sister?

329
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:50,090
Not a dead one anyway.

330
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:04,318
How'd it go?

331
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:05,814
Good.

332
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:08,197
Not sure.

333
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:10,491
No, she's in rough shape.

334
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:11,950
Oh, God.

335
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,744
Yeah. I think she'll be okay though.

336
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:15,866
Yeah. Houlihan turned up.

337
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,749
What? Well, did she see you?

338
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:22,377
I hid behind a trolley, so yeah, she did.

339
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:24,583
What the hell, Ursula?

340
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:29,885
- Yeah. Joe hates me.
- Great.

341
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:31,465
Where's Eva?

342
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:34,217
I've never seen her like this.

343
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:39,181
All she's done is shower and cry
and drink warm white wine.

344
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:45,270
Hey, how you doing, honey?

345
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,148
I know what you're all thinking.

346
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,239
What kind of an excuse of a woman

347
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:52,199
shags her dead sister's husband?

348
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:53,617
And you're right.

349
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:55,369
I just followed my fanny.

350
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:56,990
I just followed my...

351
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:00,118
You followed your heart.

352
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:01,870
Who hasn't done that?

353
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,082
Why are you looking at me?

354
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,589
We've all done it, including Grace.

355
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,091
I'm gonna fix it though.

356
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:10,759
I'm gonna fix it.

357
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:13,053
I'm gonna find Ian
and get Bla's inheritance back.

358
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:15,848
I mean, Grace would never have
left her... daughter.

359
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:16,932
She just wouldn't have...

360
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,809
Wait, Becka, she's gonna be
home soon, okay?

361
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:20,347
We need answers. I need to f...

362
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:22,599
Just please. Just...

363
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:32,401
Sorry.

364
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,072
I'm not drunk.

365
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:38,871
I'm just broken.

366
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:41,493
I know. And drunk.

367
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,094
Bibi.

368
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:08,020
No! No!

369
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:10,194
Jesus Christ.

370
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:11,778
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

371
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:15,199
What am I doing?
You almost split my face open, Bibi!

372
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:17,029
Why are you here, Joe?

373
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,454
He's a gambler.

374
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:22,164
What? Who?

375
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:23,577
Ian.

376
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:27,456
Every time I had a pint with him,
he had one eye on the horses.

377
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:31,548
Sorry. And I've never seen him
without one of those little blue pens.

378
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,045
You know, the ones they have.

379
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:35,135
He's a gambler.

380
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:36,590
Of course he is.

381
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,717
You know the thing about gamblers?

382
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:40,469
They never stop gambling.

383
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,389
So, what do we do with that?

384
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:57,991
I didn't order that. You know I'm trying
to stick to my one a day.

385
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:00,322
You're on your second already, Roger.

386
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:11,083
Cornering a man in his local again?

387
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:14,800
I won't be bribed.

388
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,130
Can we just talk to you
for a minute please, Roger?

389
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:20,467
- I've had enough of you lot.
- You're right to be raging, Roger.

390
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:23,095
- But we never wanted Angelica dead.
- Shut up.

391
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,307
I did hate her.

392
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,101
I thought she was blackmailing Grace.

393
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:31,770
But I never wanted to hurt her.

394
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:36,321
Okay, well, maybe a bit,
when she tried to ruin my marriage.

395
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:38,318
Made our lives hell.

396
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,362
She's not a bad woman.

397
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:43,240
What is it they say?

398
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,158
Hurt people hurt.

399
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:50,335
Ian did a real number on us, Roger.

400
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:52,171
And Grace.

401
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:54,173
And Angelica tried to warn us about him.

402
00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:56,128
She said he was a player.

403
00:28:58,197 --> 00:29:01,466
We need to find him to honor Grace.

404
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,845
Apparently, he's a gambler.
Loves a gee-gee.

405
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,436
And you love a flutter too,
so we thought maybe--

406
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,765
The horses.

407
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,185
I knew it. I knew I recognized him.

408
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:14,855
And I asked him one time and he denied it.

409
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:17,529
I saw him at the course.

410
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:20,073
If we could just find some lead.

411
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:22,487
One person who knows something.

412
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:25,866
Please, Roger.

413
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:31,330
Girls, you had me at honor Grace.

414
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:52,392
You not coming to the party?

415
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:55,567
He'll flip if he's catered for you,
and you don't show.

416
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:58,065
Couldn't give a cat's tit. Have fun.

417
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:40,023
Go get yourself some cake.

418
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:43,485
- Really smooth moves, Kavanagh.
- Thanks.

419
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,320
Congratulations.

420
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:48,907
Now you can do nothing
without worrying about getting caught.

421
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:51,790
Thank you, sir. And I...

422
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,585
And I'm sorry I couldn't get you
your heads to throw to the press,

423
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:56,044
but it was just one of those cases.

424
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:57,754
- Listen...
- Dead ends.

425
00:30:57,774 --> 00:31:00,716
...listen, it could have been a good one
for you to go out on.

426
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:05,220
But you're like me old dog, Loftus,
digging away and coming up with sweet FA.

427
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,223
You're lucky Grace Reilly's death
was enough of a sideshow

428
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:10,387
to keep the newshounds happy.

429
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:23,572
There's been a real mix-up with the boxes.

430
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:26,200
Only vegan arrived,
so it's good for the planet

431
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,660
but terrible for whoever has
to clean tomorrow's toilets.

432
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,073
Don't talk to me.

433
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:31,747
Yeah, with pleasure.

434
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:34,244
I mean, don't talk to me about bullshit.

435
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:36,502
You had me lie to those sisters.

436
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:40,214
Oh, Christ. Houlihan, not tonight,
all right? I'm tired.

437
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:44,301
I'm a divorced man
with an unsatisfactory golf handicap.

438
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:48,091
My fucking feet ache,
even when I'm sitting down.

439
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:52,976
And the only human being I love
in this world is leaving in a few days.

440
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:55,354
So, stick a fork in my arse.

441
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:56,647
Turn me over. I'm done.

442
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,732
So, because you've given up,
we all should?

443
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:02,439
No, no, you fire away, all right?
No better woman.

444
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,030
Because you still believe
that good people do the right thing

445
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,573
and bad people get punished.

446
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:09,196
You didn't get punished, sir.

447
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:13,413
Yeah. Well, sometimes the only way
of making something good

448
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:14,623
is by doing something bad.

449
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:17,334
Spare me. What were you
gonna use that money for?

450
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:19,294
- The broken world charity?
- No, actually.

451
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:23,627
I was gonna use it to pay a solicitor
to block Nadine from taking Jess away.

452
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:27,427
All I'm saying is it wasn't
for an all-expenses golf trip.

453
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:30,217
Do you ever think that move
might be good for your daughter?

454
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:32,558
That her mother
isn't doing it just to piss you off?

455
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:34,930
Or are you that self-involved?

456
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,351
I don't like to swear at women
but go fuck yourself.

457
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:43,397
Fuck.

458
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:58,829
I just wanted to give
DI Snatcher Loftus a proper send-off.

459
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:03,834
I've had the privilege
of learning at his knee this last while.

460
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:07,879
And he's taught me all the things
that are needed to be a great detective.

461
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:10,173
A great passion...

462
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:12,259
for golf.

463
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:16,096
Giant ego.

464
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,683
No one will ever call you sir again.

465
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,649
How will you cope out there
in the real world,

466
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:24,521
with no badge to protect you?

467
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:27,316
But most importantly,

468
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,282
the thing that he's taught me

469
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:32,362
when you can't go by the book...

470
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:37,326
is...

471
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:42,247
is how to dig hard and dig deep.

472
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:45,292
Dig 'em up, Snatcher!

473
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,837
Happy retirement, sir.

474
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:52,507
Happy retirement.

475
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,696
- This suddenly seems bonkers.
- I'm not expecting to find him.

476
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:12,694
Might get a tip-off
of where to look, is all.

477
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,665
She was so happy that day.

478
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:29,835
Remember my three-way? It was glorious.

479
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:31,635
Feels like another life.

480
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:34,424
I hate him for ruining that memory for us.

481
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,181
Sorry, ladies.

482
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:37,766
That took me by surprise.

483
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:39,261
Nerves, I think.

484
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:44,022
Okay, girls. Divide and conquer.

485
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:47,693
See if you can't set your wee peepers
on anything interesting, okay?

486
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:48,944
Yeah.

487
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:50,691
I'm just gonna get a drink first.

488
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:02,619
Thanks very much.

489
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:04,871
Oh, wait, do you recognize that lad?

490
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,084
Nah.

491
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:12,963
I have a question I wanted to ask you.

492
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:16,305
Have you ever seen a man like this
hang around here before?

493
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:17,639
I'm really sorry. I don't know him.

494
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:18,849
Guys? Anybody?

495
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:22,055
Sorry. Have you seen this guy before?
He's about 5'11"?

496
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:24,146
- He's not familiar to you?
- Sorry.

497
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:25,517
No? Okay.

498
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:30,235
People don't respond well
to a one-eyed woman looking for a man.

499
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:32,691
Yeah, it's a bit <i>Kill Bill</i>, all right.

500
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:37,618
Will you try and keep a lid on that?

501
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:39,239
No.

502
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,540
Thank you.

503
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,971
What the fuck?

504
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,724
Fuck.

505
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:17,157
Fuck.

506
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:19,409
- What are you doing in here?
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

507
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:22,366
Sorry, I'm just looking for the loo.
Is it this way?

508
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:26,495
Oh, shit. Fuck.

509
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:33,418
Urs.

510
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:36,176
- I just saw him. I just saw Ian. He's...
- Are you sure?

511
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:38,465
Yeah... There. Oh, shit.
He's going... Come on.

512
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,302
Ladies, have you got a pass?

513
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:45,519
Yeah. It's in there.
I left it in my handbag.

514
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:46,645
So, while I go and...

515
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:48,313
That handbag?

516
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,190
What's so important in there anyway?

517
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,401
Michael D. Higgins
and a bloody chocolate fountain?

518
00:36:52,421 --> 00:36:55,195
- Okay, just... Okay. Okay.
- Come on.

519
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:57,985
Sorry. Just talk to you for a sec?

520
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:00,742
- Thanks. I'm her nurse.
- Okay.

521
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:03,782
She's actually on a day release,
she hasn't been out in a while.

522
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:05,993
What's your name?

523
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:10,294
Shit.

524
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:11,873
Ian.

525
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:14,710
What are you doing?

526
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:17,009
Get out of here.

527
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:20,424
Who the fuck is she? Do you know her?
Anyway...

528
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:30,058
Oh, shit.

529
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:55,751
Can I ask you a question?

530
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:58,342
Only if I can ask you one first.

531
00:37:58,362 --> 00:37:59,880
Go on.

532
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:02,012
What are you doing later?

533
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:04,264
My Kegels. I'm pregnant.

534
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:05,344
Oh, Christ. All right.

535
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:07,638
Do you know this lad?

536
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:11,605
Oh, yeah, I've seen him around.

537
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:12,643
You have?

538
00:38:13,377 --> 00:38:15,651
But you wanna ask him over there, Murph.

539
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:17,402
He's a regular of his.

540
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:19,608
He only ever uses lucky number five.

541
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:24,655
Let's go.

542
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:27,371
Eva, did you see him? Is he here?

543
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:30,082
No, he's not here. Let's just go.

544
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:34,503
And even if he was here,
we've got nothing on him, okay?

545
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:36,213
He's got everything on us.

546
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:37,876
Roger's got something.

547
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:41,301
It's not much, mind, but Ian's not Ian.

548
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:42,965
He's Cormac from Tyrone.

549
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:45,722
What?

550
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:47,307
His first name's Cormac.

551
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:49,179
Yeah, we've got that.

552
00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:53,225
His lucky number's five?

553
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:09,408
I'm gonna have a shower.

554
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:11,910
Empty the booze cabinet.

555
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:14,871
Not in me.

556
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:19,084
I can't deal with any more drama.

557
00:39:21,904 --> 00:39:22,879
You go in.

558
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:25,299
I got this.

559
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:32,681
You look lovely.

560
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:36,184
Thanks. I was at the races.

561
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:39,229
- Did you win?
- No.

562
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:42,274
Actually, a little win.

563
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:44,656
Do you want to go inside?

564
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:46,653
Yeah. Yeah.

565
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,331
- I've been thinking about getting in--
- I've been thinking about us a lot.

566
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:54,077
- Oh, sorry.
- It's okay.

567
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:56,538
You go.

568
00:39:57,147 --> 00:40:00,917
Well, I've been thinking about your baby.

569
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:05,302
And you, of course, obviously.

570
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:06,757
- Not just your baby.
- Okay.

571
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:13,764
I've been thinking about
how great this could be.

572
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:17,976
And how great a mam you'll make.

573
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:20,734
And I think you should

574
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:23,273
- try and make it work with Joe.
- I've realized it needs to be with Joe.

575
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:26,193
- We should stop doing that.
- Yeah.

576
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:30,197
I don't think I can break up a family.

577
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:34,409
I don't think I could ever
let go of what happened...

578
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:39,122
if I keep holding on to you.

579
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:51,176
Thank you.

580
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,013
You saved me.

581
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:00,811
At the worst time of my life.

582
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:03,480
You too.

583
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,067
And that's the truth.

584
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:25,377
I was gonna name the baby Minna,

585
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:27,838
but it's a boy.

586
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:31,425
Well, you could always
call it Mattie then.

587
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:34,886
Little Mattie?

588
00:41:36,622 --> 00:41:37,723
No.

589
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:26,063
Oh, shit.

590
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:35,828
What?

591
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:38,831
I got his stupid, dodgy phone open.
I think I know where he lives.

592
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:40,118
What?

593
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:42,417
What?

594
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:44,414
<i>Or the area anyway.</i>

595
00:42:44,815 --> 00:42:47,501
<i>Maybe that's where Grace was headed,
up North, to try and find him.</i>

596
00:42:48,944 --> 00:42:50,050
I'm gonna go and look for him.

597
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,927
No, you won't.

598
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:53,011
Don't be a stupid cow.

599
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:55,300
<i>Wait for us and we'll all go together.</i>

600
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:57,636
Okay.

601
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:39,386
Hi. Hey, sorry.

602
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:43,015
I'm visiting my cousin Cormac.

603
00:43:43,707 --> 00:43:45,606
It's my first time visiting though,
and I dropped my phone down the loo,

604
00:43:45,626 --> 00:43:48,358
so no number and no address.

605
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:50,188
Did you try putting it in rice?

606
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:52,488
No. I will. I will though.

607
00:43:52,508 --> 00:43:53,984
Do you know him?

608
00:43:56,261 --> 00:43:57,779
Cormac Sweeney's your cousin?

609
00:43:59,681 --> 00:44:01,580
Last big house on the left.

610
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,082
Last big house in the...
on the left, this fella?

611
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:06,084
Yeah, opposite the house
with the red car outside.

612
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:10,083
Okay. Thanks. Thank you.

613
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:42,120
- Sorry, I don't know him.
- I was told he lives here.

614
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,826
Maybe before I moved in.
I haven't been here long.

615
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:46,870
Okay.

616
00:44:48,188 --> 00:44:51,588
He might go by the name, Ian Reilly.

617
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:54,591
No, I'm sorry.
I don't know him, whatever his name is.

618
00:44:54,611 --> 00:44:55,671
Mammy?

619
00:44:57,114 --> 00:44:59,346
What about... Sorry.

620
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:01,760
What about this woman?

621
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:03,559
Her name's Grace.

622
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:07,187
Has anyone called that ever come here
or called or...

623
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:10,060
What's all this about? Who's she?

624
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:11,728
She's my sister.

625
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:14,606
Or was. She's dead.

626
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:20,112
I'm sorry.

627
00:45:21,638 --> 00:45:23,490
And I'm sorry that I can't help you.

628
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:28,370
I hope you find whoever
you're looking for.

629
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:32,666
Yeah, me too. Okay.

630
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:52,728
Yeah. Listen,

631
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:57,733
Why don't you find me some of those
little yellow bricks, okay?

632
00:45:59,343 --> 00:46:00,611
Good boy.

633
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:07,534
You said they'd never come to our door
or anywhere near our kids.

634
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:10,078
You need to sort this out.

635
00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:15,709
Found it, Dad.

636
00:46:18,654 --> 00:46:20,844
<i>I'm up in Donegal.</i>

637
00:46:20,864 --> 00:46:22,804
Are you nuts to go looking
for him on your own?

638
00:46:22,824 --> 00:46:25,886
Well, I didn't find him, did I?
So chill out.

639
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:28,101
I've got a last name though.

640
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:29,561
Sweeney.

641
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:30,979
And he definitely used to live there.

642
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:33,857
What if finding this bastard
is worse for us than letting him go?

643
00:46:33,877 --> 00:46:35,526
It's not about us.

644
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:36,819
Not for me.

645
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:38,028
I'm doing this for Grace.

646
00:46:38,048 --> 00:46:39,441
For Blanaid.

647
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,407
We'll talk when I get back, okay?

648
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:44,321
<i>Make a plan.</i>

649
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:47,371
Are you all nodding?

650
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:50,452
Sorry. Yeah. See you in a bit.

651
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:57,417
I have an idea.

652
00:46:59,695 --> 00:47:00,796
What?

653
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:11,353
- Thank you very much. Keep it coming.
- Hi.

654
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:12,641
Hello.

655
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:15,315
White wine for the lady?

656
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:16,525
- Yeah.
- Coming right up.

657
00:47:16,545 --> 00:47:18,313
Please. Thank you.

658
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:22,484
Are you drunk?

659
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:25,445
Am I drunk?

660
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:29,413
Am I drunk? Yeah, absolutely.

661
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:31,165
Yeah. I'm celebrating.

662
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:34,413
I'm celebrating the end of my career

663
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:39,167
and the end of everything.

664
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:43,922
My daughter moves to Oz tomoz.

665
00:47:44,448 --> 00:47:46,597
- Okay. Well, sorry to hear that.
- Here you go.

666
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:47,718
Thank you.

667
00:47:48,535 --> 00:47:49,678
Hey.

668
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:52,806
To new beginnings.

669
00:47:53,665 --> 00:47:57,232
Listen. Your text was a nice surprise.

670
00:47:57,252 --> 00:47:58,317
Good.

671
00:47:58,337 --> 00:48:01,236
Yeah, 'cause it all felt a bit, you know,

672
00:48:01,256 --> 00:48:03,489
with me... on the case.

673
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:05,949
And never the twain etcetera.

674
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:07,154
- But now--
- No.

675
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:08,619
No?

676
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:10,496
No, I didn't--

677
00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:11,413
You didn't?

678
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:14,661
No, I'm just here to ask for your help.

679
00:48:16,772 --> 00:48:18,795
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

680
00:48:18,815 --> 00:48:21,381
My sisters and I just really
need to track down Ian Reilly.

681
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:24,379
He also goes by the name Cormac Sweeney.

682
00:48:25,656 --> 00:48:28,884
No. No. No.

683
00:48:29,493 --> 00:48:31,016
I'm... That's over for me.

684
00:48:31,036 --> 00:48:33,060
Like I said, I'm retired.

685
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,561
I told you that, right?

686
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:36,308
RIP me.

687
00:48:37,543 --> 00:48:39,399
What do you want to
bloody find him for anyway?

688
00:48:39,419 --> 00:48:42,522
Because he's a lying
piece of shit for one.

689
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:44,696
Quit while you're ahead.

690
00:48:44,716 --> 00:48:48,951
Put the 20 grand into an account for
Grace's daughter and you cut your losses.

691
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:52,996
And yeah,
count yourself lucky that I even found it

692
00:48:53,016 --> 00:48:56,411
because those turtles
could have had it for their din-dins.

693
00:48:57,479 --> 00:48:59,795
What are you talking about?
They found it in Grace's car.

694
00:48:59,815 --> 00:49:02,709
- Houlihan told us.
- Yeah.

695
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:06,338
It was found in the car, right?

696
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:09,847
Yeah, it was. Yeah.

697
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:11,473
You found the money at Grace's?

698
00:49:11,493 --> 00:49:13,303
Yeah. Grace's car.

699
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:19,601
You're a disgrace.

700
00:49:31,722 --> 00:49:32,864
Reggie.

701
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,707
Yes. Sorry. Thanks for calling me back.

702
00:49:36,727 --> 00:49:39,413
Well, DI Loftus said I should call you so...

703
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:43,297
Adolf, yes. Oh, my God, yes. So funny.

704
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:46,128
It's not problematic at all.

705
00:49:48,572 --> 00:49:49,631
Yeah.

706
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:51,883
Did you...

707
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:54,261
Did you get everything I sent through?

708
00:49:57,122 --> 00:50:00,434
I need something on him, Reggie.
I think he could be dangerous and--

709
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:03,400
Well, I'm pretty sure
that he's from the North

710
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,689
so you might have better luck
through the PSNI.

711
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:10,902
Please. Just keep trawling.

712
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:13,947
Okay.

713
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:40,474
Yes, Reggie.

714
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:42,476
Come on, you sexy bastard.

715
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:09,169
What the fuck?

716
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:27,396
You nasty piece of shit.

717
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:32,818
<i>Leave a message for Blanaid.</i>

718
00:51:44,897 --> 00:51:46,545
Is Blanaid still inside?

719
00:51:46,565 --> 00:51:47,504
Don't think so.

720
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:49,047
Okay. Did she go into town or...

721
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:51,169
I saw her leave with her stepdad.

722
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:22,242
Hello, Eva.
