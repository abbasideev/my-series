1
00:00:57,287 --> 00:01:00,348
Okay. Okay.

2
00:01:05,962 --> 00:01:07,318
Oh, fuck.

3
00:01:07,338 --> 00:01:08,982
Eva. Eva!

4
00:01:10,508 --> 00:01:12,699
- Eva!
- It's not my car!

5
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,903
Sorry.

6
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:16,656
It's not my car.

7
00:01:36,993 --> 00:01:38,094
Ready?

8
00:02:03,228 --> 00:02:05,705
I've changed my mind. I'm not ready.

9
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:07,999
To open it?

10
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:09,714
No. For what happens after.

11
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:13,588
Nothing's gonna happen, okay?
We have it covered.

12
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:15,882
Are we sure?

13
00:02:16,574 --> 00:02:17,759
Of course we're sure.

14
00:02:28,753 --> 00:02:30,860
Are you counting yourself down
from a hundred?

15
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,440
Can we please just get it done?

16
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:05,473
Grace. Grace!

17
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:07,053
Wake up, Grace!

18
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:10,353
I'm sorry. Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

19
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:12,100
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

20
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:15,853
Fine. I'll marry you.

21
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:19,153
It's not funny.

22
00:05:19,173 --> 00:05:22,527
Since I'm the one getting choked,
I decide what's funny.

23
00:05:25,138 --> 00:05:26,239
Come here.

24
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:30,952
Oh, God.

25
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:34,455
Ach,
your heart is going like the clappers.

26
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,210
Can I ask you something?

27
00:05:43,114 --> 00:05:44,966
You ready to be my wife?

28
00:06:05,136 --> 00:06:10,033
- Wow.
- Ladies and gentlemen, she has boobs.

29
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:12,827
Oh, my God.

30
00:06:13,937 --> 00:06:15,418
They look great.

31
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:18,213
Oh, my God, girl.

32
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:20,673
You're gorgeous. Look at this.

33
00:06:20,693 --> 00:06:22,133
- Bride to be.
- You don't have to wear that.

34
00:06:22,153 --> 00:06:23,760
No, I want it.

35
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,264
Just promise me
there won't be any strippers or dwarfs.

36
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:29,682
You can't say dwarfs, love.

37
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:30,850
Oh, sorry, sorry.

38
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,478
There'll be no little people
taking off any clothes.

39
00:06:33,498 --> 00:06:34,979
That's not true.

40
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:36,601
Put it away, Becka.

41
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:44,859
Really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

42
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,070
That used to be your job.

43
00:06:47,637 --> 00:06:48,952
This used to be yours.

44
00:06:48,972 --> 00:06:51,366
Yeah, well, luckily I don't miss it.

45
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:53,326
Samesies.

46
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:56,120
What can I say? We're all grown up now.

47
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:01,506
I'm stuck here now.

48
00:07:01,526 --> 00:07:02,799
Stop.

49
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:03,920
What?

50
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,005
Waiting for something to go wrong.

51
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:07,512
I'm not.

52
00:07:07,532 --> 00:07:09,842
I just don't know
why she needed to get married again.

53
00:07:10,618 --> 00:07:12,100
She's a different breed of woman to you.

54
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,560
She likes to play by the rules.

55
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,313
Yeah, I don't have a problem
with the rules, just the rule-makers.

56
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,394
Right on. Fuck the system.

57
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:22,021
Forty-eight euro.

58
00:07:23,882 --> 00:07:25,071
What?

59
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:27,365
Jesus. It's so easy for that bitch.

60
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:29,075
What, you wanna be chatting up little men?

61
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:31,035
No, I want little men chatting up me.

62
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:32,453
Go on Hinge.

63
00:07:32,473 --> 00:07:33,825
I am on Hinge.

64
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:36,119
Don't pity me.

65
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:38,997
You know?

66
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:40,211
Hi.

67
00:07:40,231 --> 00:07:42,589
- Hi. I found a jockey.
- Are you busy? Busy, busy?

68
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:44,591
She has three kids. FYI.

69
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:45,675
That's not true.

70
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:46,759
One's an adult.

71
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,136
I don't give a shit.

72
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:50,889
I'm just gonna steal her away now
if that's all right.

73
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:54,309
Mind your little noggin now,
jumping all those tall fences.

74
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:55,810
It's the boots. Oh, my God.

75
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,015
We got the champers.

76
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:59,480
- He's so cute...
- He was too small.

77
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,193
- House champagne.
- So, what's the plan?

78
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:04,944
Out of funds, so out of fun.

79
00:08:04,964 --> 00:08:06,070
What? Are we?

80
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,655
What the hell? Where'd you get that?

81
00:08:07,675 --> 00:08:10,200
- I did a three-way on Cherry Pop.
- It's called an each-way.

82
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,910
Whatever. I won 500 quid.

83
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,454
- Oh, my-- No. No, no, no.
- Stop.

84
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:16,784
I think I changed my mind
about the stripper.

85
00:08:17,477 --> 00:08:18,750
I have the number. Let's do it.

86
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,585
- No penises.
- I can call him now.

87
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:22,707
No, I'm not looking at any penises.

88
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:28,635
Who's your one?

89
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:30,214
That's Angelica.

90
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:33,723
- Is she Roger's girlfriend?
- His sister.

91
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:35,345
You didn't answer my question.

92
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:38,348
Look.

93
00:08:38,915 --> 00:08:41,271
Gracie, how are ya? Long time no see.

94
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,941
Hey, Roger. I'm grand.

95
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:44,353
Angelica.

96
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:48,696
It's so good to see you.
I'm sorry I haven't been in touch.

97
00:08:48,716 --> 00:08:52,575
Not at all. I'm just delighted to see you.
You're looking so well.

98
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:54,452
Thanks. So are you.

99
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:57,659
I just poured myself into this
this morning. I just poured.

100
00:09:00,562 --> 00:09:01,876
You must remember my sisters.

101
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:04,003
- Yeah. Hi. How are you?
- Hello.

102
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:05,708
Look at The Nolans, what?

103
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:09,212
And this one. The beauty of the family.

104
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:14,222
A little birdie tells me that you and Ian
are getting married.

105
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:17,392
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Sorry, it was all a bit of a whirlwind.

106
00:09:17,412 --> 00:09:19,894
So finally you put this fella
out of his misery.

107
00:09:19,914 --> 00:09:21,391
Oh, no.

108
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,731
He's always held a candle for her.

109
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:25,149
Angelica.

110
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:28,856
I'm only joking with you.
Sure, we've given up on all that.

111
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,739
Did he tell you
that cohabitants we are now?

112
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,116
<i>As the final runners arrive...</i>

113
00:09:33,136 --> 00:09:36,995
Oh, God. Have you got the kitty, Rogey?

114
00:09:37,015 --> 00:09:39,414
A wee tip for the next race, girls.

115
00:09:39,434 --> 00:09:40,373
Yeah, yeah.

116
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:42,286
Hurry Stiles.

117
00:09:42,812 --> 00:09:46,124
I'm just going to put a few quid on.

118
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:52,051
Delighted, thrilled to have
just bumped into you, Gracie.

119
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:53,339
And you too.

120
00:09:54,324 --> 00:09:57,927
And again,
I'm sorry for not getting in touch.

121
00:09:58,786 --> 00:10:01,347
Not at all, sure, why would ya?

122
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,685
Great to see ya, Sister Sledge.

123
00:10:07,378 --> 00:10:08,479
God bless.

124
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,648
Sister Sledge?

125
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:13,907
You're moving out of your lovely cottage?

126
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,654
It's, you know, time to move on.

127
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,908
A lot of memories in that place
and not enough good ones.

128
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:24,454
It is lovely to see ya.

129
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:30,089
- Hurry.
- You should come to the wedding.

130
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:32,258
It's nothing fancy. It's just at Eva's.

131
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:33,760
- Oi.
- Sorry.

132
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,262
I have to have a look at my diary.

133
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:37,467
Of course.

134
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:40,428
That's a joke. I don't have a diary.

135
00:10:42,205 --> 00:10:44,182
Well, see you there.

136
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,564
You all set for shellfish?

137
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:48,102
We're shellfished up to our gees.

138
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,356
Just bring your lovely self, Roger.

139
00:10:52,382 --> 00:10:53,858
- See you.
- You too.

140
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:57,283
- Okay. Right. What'd she say?
- Hurry Stiles.

141
00:10:57,303 --> 00:10:59,285
- Hurry Stiles.
- Hurry Stiles. I just got it.

142
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:01,240
- Hurry. Hurry.
- Come on.

143
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:07,418
<i>So the runners are now riding down
towards the post,</i>

144
00:11:07,438 --> 00:11:10,255
<i>and loading is almost ready
to get underway for our future contest.</i>

145
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:11,840
Come on guys. Put on each-way.

146
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,759
- Okay. Hurry Stiles.
- Okay, 300, please,

147
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,177
- on Hurry Stiles--
- No. Wait.

148
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:17,971
- 350.
- Put 350 on it.

149
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:20,009
Anyone else? What's your bet, sir?

150
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,144
I'll have 15 quid on Stiles.

151
00:11:31,713 --> 00:11:33,027
Oh, my God!

152
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:35,274
If we win, it's over two grand.

153
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:37,652
Trouble on legs, them Garveys.

154
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:40,577
That's a good name for a horse.

155
00:11:40,597 --> 00:11:43,199
Be a better name for a strip club,
though, wouldn't it?

156
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,784
Watch your mouth.

157
00:11:46,102 --> 00:11:47,203
And give me a note.

158
00:11:47,604 --> 00:11:48,997
We're not in bloody Vegas.

159
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:53,710
Yeah, Justin, can I get a fiver there?

160
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:01,472
<i>Now the runners are straightening up,</i>

161
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:03,141
<i>they've got just over
two furlongs to race.</i>

162
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:04,517
<i>And as they do so, it's Mr. Elsom,</i>

163
00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:07,020
<i>the first who leads them
into the straight towards the outside.</i>

164
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,683
You happy now you've seen her?

165
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,520
I think she was happy to see me too.

166
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:15,732
Wasn't she?

167
00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:18,823
- Sure.
- <i>They're the leading trio</i>

168
00:12:18,843 --> 00:12:21,242
<i>as they head now to make their way
towards the final furlong.</i>

169
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:24,078
<i>Now Mr. Elsom and Calamity Casey
are beginning to quicken...</i>

170
00:12:24,098 --> 00:12:25,366
Go on, boy.

171
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,201
Yes.

172
00:12:27,977 --> 00:12:30,705
Go on, Stiles. Go on, Stiles.

173
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:34,964
Come on, Hurry Stiles! Come on!

174
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:36,836
Go on, lad. Push on. Push on.

175
00:12:37,612 --> 00:12:39,881
There you go, lad. There you go.

176
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:41,930
Go on, Stiles!

177
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,094
That's it! Yes! My God, yes!

178
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:48,181
<i>Hurry Stiles has won the Emerald Cup.</i>

179
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:51,768
Oh, my God!

180
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:54,896
Oh, my God.

181
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:00,777
How much did we win?

182
00:13:01,386 --> 00:13:02,737
Did I not say?

183
00:13:03,638 --> 00:13:06,824
Eamonn Doyle slowed me down talking shite.
I didn't get the bet on.

184
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:09,202
What?

185
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:23,096
Oh, my God! We won!

186
00:13:23,116 --> 00:13:24,133
We won!

187
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:27,595
- Did we?
- We did. We won!

188
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:53,751
It's a bit more than sediment buildup.

189
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:54,956
Heave it.

190
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:58,965
- What is it?
- Weighs a fecking ton, whatever it is.

191
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:00,169
Mam.

192
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,594
- What's in it?
- What's that, darling?

193
00:14:02,614 --> 00:14:04,345
What do you wanna do?
Do you wanna open it?

194
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:05,550
Sure.

195
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:15,852
Oh, God Almighty.

196
00:14:35,563 --> 00:14:37,795
Gust of wind came out of fecking nowhere.

197
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:39,584
That's some flyer, all right.

198
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:49,098
Did you check out
that deejay I sent your way?

199
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:51,601
Yeah. Yeah, I'm not hiring a bald deejay.

200
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:53,061
No, thanks.

201
00:14:53,081 --> 00:14:55,892
You don't want crooner music
at a retirement party either.

202
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:57,398
You want pop.

203
00:14:57,418 --> 00:15:00,688
Swift, Beyoncé, Bulldog.

204
00:15:01,464 --> 00:15:03,691
- Pitbull.
- Yeah, he's good too.

205
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:06,027
Sir!

206
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:08,488
Who the hell is that?

207
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:11,746
- Shall I come to you, sir?
- Is that Houlihan?

208
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,034
Houli-- Who?

209
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:15,370
Just stepped up from uniform to the unit.

210
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,206
Oh, yeah.
I didn't recognize her in her clothes.

211
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:22,835
In her civvies, I meant. Get a grip.

212
00:15:23,945 --> 00:15:25,463
What the hell is she do--

213
00:15:26,197 --> 00:15:27,840
Get off the green.

214
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:31,678
Get-- Why? Walk around. Walk around.

215
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:34,060
- Don't touch the ball.
- Sorry. Sorry.

216
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,728
- Leave it. Get--
- Don't touch that!

217
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:36,688
Sorry. Thank you.

218
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:40,770
Jesus fucking Christ.

219
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:45,108
Sorry, sir. The D Super sent me.

220
00:15:45,508 --> 00:15:47,282
You're needed at a house in Skerries.

221
00:15:47,302 --> 00:15:49,742
Right. Yeah, well,
I'm finishing my round first.

222
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:52,281
He-- The boss is keen
to get you there ASAP, sir.

223
00:15:52,682 --> 00:15:54,831
A dismembered body's
been found in a suitcase.

224
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:56,416
- What?
- In a suitcase,

225
00:15:56,436 --> 00:15:58,918
in a pond,
in a back garden on Yeats Street.

226
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:00,003
Dismembered?

227
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:01,207
Not all in one piece.

228
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:05,586
Yes, I know what bloody--
I know what dismembered means.

229
00:16:08,072 --> 00:16:09,966
Oh, for God's sake.

230
00:16:10,408 --> 00:16:12,760
Tango Foxtrot 7224 to Control.

231
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:17,932
- Yeah, Loftus has arrived.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

232
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,019
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
- Go that way.

233
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:25,189
Sorry now. Sorry.

234
00:16:45,026 --> 00:16:47,045
Sorry, sir. Sign in there.

235
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:48,671
She's with me.

236
00:16:49,906 --> 00:16:51,132
Unfortunately.

237
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:53,343
He's not very nice.

238
00:16:56,246 --> 00:16:57,680
Is it this way?

239
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:08,399
Houlihan, stay close.

240
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,245
We're waiting for the DI to arrive.

241
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:19,619
So as soon as he's here,
we'll check out the suitcase. All right?

242
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:21,621
All right, Snatcher.

243
00:17:22,187 --> 00:17:23,461
Snatcher?

244
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:24,546
What have you got for me?

245
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:26,297
I've seen prettier corpses.

246
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:28,132
Keep your private life to yourself.

247
00:17:28,152 --> 00:17:30,546
- Hello.
- Any personal property found?

248
00:17:32,907 --> 00:17:34,258
He'd a nice suitcase.

249
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:38,846
Oh, Jesus.

250
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:40,807
What do you think?

251
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:46,150
Could it be a sex thing, sir?

252
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,569
What?

253
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:50,154
No, it couldn't. A bloody sex thing.

254
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:51,906
Sorry. Sorry, sir.

255
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:54,951
Just 'cause of the suitcase,
I was thinking about that spy fella.

256
00:17:54,971 --> 00:17:56,953
And when do you think
the sex bit happened?

257
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:59,117
Before or after he lost his feet?

258
00:18:01,603 --> 00:18:03,543
Bring in the state pathologist, yeah?

259
00:18:03,563 --> 00:18:07,250
Don't want Kathleen bloody Murtagh
fitting this in between her salsa classes.

260
00:18:07,942 --> 00:18:09,174
If he's been in the water awhile,

261
00:18:09,194 --> 00:18:12,922
it'll be like trying to find
a pulse on a beef bourguignon.

262
00:18:13,448 --> 00:18:15,216
And I want all eyes on this.

263
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,552
I'm gonna take a look around.

264
00:18:21,581 --> 00:18:23,641
Apparently a pal of yours
used to live here.

265
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,899
How do you mean, "a pal of mine"?

266
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,354
That fella you dug up two years ago,

267
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,690
John Paul Williams.

268
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:45,705
No. No.

269
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:48,124
Fuck.

270
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:06,100
Jesus. It's your sister's wedding.
Take a day off.

271
00:19:07,502 --> 00:19:08,858
It was an hour.

272
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:12,148
I've been up since 05:00 rolling pastry.
Stick it up your hole.

273
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:14,239
- That was brilliant.
- Great. Thank you.

274
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:15,615
You were pretty slow today.

275
00:19:15,635 --> 00:19:17,028
Fuck off, Eileen.

276
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,493
You don't think five smoked salmon's
a bit excessive, no?

277
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:25,703
No, I don't think so. No.

278
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:29,832
Don't mention or say salmon.

279
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:34,843
- There she is.
- Shut up.

280
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:36,803
The most important person of the day.

281
00:19:36,823 --> 00:19:38,007
Chief bridesmaid.

282
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:40,014
Head flower girl, actually.

283
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:42,517
All the aul ones have taken
the bridesmaids' spots.

284
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:43,601
Cheek.

285
00:19:43,621 --> 00:19:47,433
- Mam said she's ready for you now.
- Did she? Princess Grace?

286
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:49,399
Oh, shit. It's 11:40.

287
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:51,270
- Let's go up. Let's go.
- Wait!

288
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:53,022
Fish hands.

289
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,691
Oh, God. Yeah.

290
00:19:56,009 --> 00:19:57,657
- Where the hell's Becka?
- Becka!

291
00:19:57,677 --> 00:20:00,780
- Jesus Christ.
- Get up, you lazy cow!

292
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:04,993
Becka! Do not make me come up there!

293
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:07,453
- Jesus, that's horrible.
- The hell?

294
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:09,080
What's that?

295
00:20:09,856 --> 00:20:10,957
Oh, God.

296
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:15,758
Shall I come with ya?

297
00:20:15,778 --> 00:20:18,464
Not unless you want
my sisters to braid your hair.

298
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:22,552
They like me though, don't they?

299
00:20:23,328 --> 00:20:24,309
They can't stand you.

300
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:27,187
Becka, I'm serious. They--
Your sisters, they all like me, right?

301
00:20:27,207 --> 00:20:29,105
Jesus, yeah, they all like ya.

302
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,900
Well, except for Bibi 'cause
you asked if lesbians got periods.

303
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,438
Oh, for God's sake.

304
00:20:33,838 --> 00:20:35,148
No sense of humor.

305
00:20:35,673 --> 00:20:37,275
That's the problem with lesbians.

306
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:39,115
- Yeah, just... just...
- No. Joe!

307
00:20:39,135 --> 00:20:40,653
...come here for a sec.

308
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:32,246
Not yet.

309
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:38,007
- Welcome to you both.
- Thank you.

310
00:21:38,027 --> 00:21:40,552
Your sisters would like you to know
that Mam and Dad

311
00:21:40,572 --> 00:21:42,674
would be very proud of you today.

312
00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:44,973
We are gathered here

313
00:21:44,993 --> 00:21:49,430
to celebrate the unique and timely love
of Grace Garvey and Ian Reilly...

314
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:53,064
Two years ago,
you dig up John Paul Williams

315
00:21:53,084 --> 00:21:56,025
at a cost of nearly 30 fecking grand
because, apparently,

316
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:58,945
there's compelling evidence
that his life was under threat.

317
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:00,989
And with respect, sir,
that's information I couldn't ignore.

318
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:03,027
And then you close it again
as an accident.

319
00:22:03,803 --> 00:22:06,160
Hugely embarrassing at the time,
but not nearly as embarrassing

320
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,788
as it's going to be
when the department see that you missed

321
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:11,499
an entire house of fecking horrors
while you were at it.

322
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,210
Well, the results of the postmortem
were inconclusive, so...

323
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,337
So? So you left it at that?
Nothing to see here.

324
00:22:16,357 --> 00:22:18,047
Well, I followed
proper policing procedure.

325
00:22:18,067 --> 00:22:21,718
I knew you were a lazy bastard,
but this-- this is incompetence.

326
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:23,428
This is next-level.

327
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:26,222
I want to know exactly
what happened in that house

328
00:22:26,242 --> 00:22:28,766
and if you mess things up again this time,
you're finished.

329
00:22:28,786 --> 00:22:29,971
Do you hear me?

330
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,140
No retiring with glory.

331
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,683
I'll make sure of that.

332
00:22:34,334 --> 00:22:37,817
I want heads arrested and sent down.

333
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:39,194
Do we understand each other?

334
00:22:39,214 --> 00:22:40,398
Sir.

335
00:22:40,882 --> 00:22:42,447
And Houlihan will be staying on with ya.

336
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:43,615
No, no, no.

337
00:22:43,635 --> 00:22:46,492
It's not my job to teach little girls
how to be detectives.

338
00:22:46,512 --> 00:22:47,619
It is.

339
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:49,829
It is literally in your job description.

340
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:52,160
- But she's-- she's a-- she's--
- She's what?

341
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:54,250
But she's an oddball.

342
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,836
She's 25. She's made detective.

343
00:22:56,856 --> 00:22:59,959
She's also a diverse female officer.

344
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:04,677
Probably non-binary
or some bollocks by the look of her.

345
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:06,596
You overlook those ones at your peril.

346
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:08,343
I'm not comfortable with that language.

347
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:10,683
What? What language?

348
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:12,013
"Those ones."

349
00:23:12,747 --> 00:23:14,521
But you called her a bleeding oddball.

350
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,601
Look, get out of here and get on with it!

351
00:23:23,758 --> 00:23:26,277
Can you RSVP to the invite to my party?

352
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:27,862
For numbers.

353
00:23:28,263 --> 00:23:29,197
Thank you.

354
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:32,950
"My party."

355
00:23:33,476 --> 00:23:34,577
Jesus.

356
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:37,747
Well done, young lad!

357
00:23:45,238 --> 00:23:46,464
I am done.

358
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:49,801
- Lightweight.
- I'm gonna get a pint.

359
00:23:54,747 --> 00:23:56,933
I didn't know you invited Angelica.

360
00:23:57,417 --> 00:23:58,518
She hadn't.

361
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:02,277
It's fine. I should've asked her really.

362
00:24:02,297 --> 00:24:04,404
Why? I didn't even know
you were that friendly.

363
00:24:04,424 --> 00:24:07,026
Oh, yeah, we got close after--

364
00:24:08,428 --> 00:24:10,947
you know, when I was volunteering, and--

365
00:24:11,806 --> 00:24:13,950
but then, it got a bit suffocating.

366
00:24:15,518 --> 00:24:16,703
But sure, it's fine.

367
00:24:18,354 --> 00:24:19,872
It's no one's fault.

368
00:24:29,073 --> 00:24:30,717
Eileen? No?

369
00:24:31,576 --> 00:24:33,808
- Joe, I hear you're a man...
- Joe, pint?

370
00:24:33,828 --> 00:24:35,847
- Grand.
- ...who enjoys a bit of salmon.

371
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:39,606
Did Bibi tell you?
We've chosen an egg donor.

372
00:24:39,626 --> 00:24:40,773
Wait, you're doing it?

373
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:44,152
What? Oh, my Go-- Oh, my God.

374
00:24:44,172 --> 00:24:45,356
An egg donor?

375
00:24:45,965 --> 00:24:48,072
Isn't that like a bonus
of being a lesbian couple?

376
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:49,574
You have loads of eggs?

377
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:50,533
Not anymore.

378
00:24:50,553 --> 00:24:52,363
So you're gonna use Bibi's sperm, or...

379
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:54,913
Stop.

380
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:56,873
Sorry. I don't know why I said that.

381
00:24:56,893 --> 00:24:58,917
- Nerves. Sorry.
- Wait. So you're--

382
00:24:58,937 --> 00:25:00,335
You'll be carrying it or...

383
00:25:00,355 --> 00:25:01,831
Yeah. Yeah.

384
00:25:02,482 --> 00:25:03,875
Thank God.

385
00:25:04,275 --> 00:25:06,132
Could you imagine Bibi pregnant?

386
00:25:06,152 --> 00:25:08,426
- What? She'd be cute.
- You'll be next.

387
00:25:08,446 --> 00:25:09,761
No fucking way. Thank you very much.

388
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:10,887
Hold on a sec.

389
00:25:10,907 --> 00:25:12,055
Why the hell not?

390
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:13,139
- No.
- Come on.

391
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:15,762
Gross. Get your sperm away from me.

392
00:25:17,622 --> 00:25:18,890
Nah.

393
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:21,231
Yeah. If I--

394
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:22,810
We're the same, you and I.

395
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,771
Are we?

396
00:25:25,755 --> 00:25:26,569
In what way?

397
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:30,276
Well, we're women of a certain age
who understand we can't have it all.

398
00:25:30,677 --> 00:25:33,613
But we're happy with that.
We're content with our lot.

399
00:25:34,222 --> 00:25:36,788
- Eileen, this is Angelica.
- Hello.

400
00:25:36,808 --> 00:25:39,165
How are you blessed
to know this family, Eileen?

401
00:25:39,185 --> 00:25:40,083
Through Eva.

402
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:42,872
We've been working together.
I'm her menopause coach.

403
00:25:44,232 --> 00:25:45,625
Menopause coach?

404
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:49,295
Is that real?

405
00:25:51,155 --> 00:25:53,012
It sounds make-y up-y.

406
00:25:53,032 --> 00:25:55,218
No, it's-- Yeah. Yeah.

407
00:25:56,202 --> 00:25:59,097
There's a thing.
Out in the open with it all.

408
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:00,807
Good Lord.

409
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,523
Speech.

410
00:26:03,543 --> 00:26:06,896
- Speech. Come on.
- That's important. The speech.

411
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:10,613
We met when we weren't
looking to meet anyone at all,

412
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:14,362
but we couldn't believe
how easy it all felt.

413
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:19,617
And I think now
that was down to you, my love.

414
00:26:20,894 --> 00:26:24,789
I have never met anybody kinder,

415
00:26:25,356 --> 00:26:30,670
more gracious, generous,
horrible taste in pets.

416
00:26:31,738 --> 00:26:35,221
I thought the tortoises were Blanaid's,
so I was like, "Grand."

417
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:37,218
But they're not. They're hers.

418
00:26:38,703 --> 00:26:40,894
They give me nightmares, Grace.

419
00:26:40,914 --> 00:26:42,724
But anyway, forget all that.

420
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:48,146
I am a lucky man because I married
the most beautiful woman.

421
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,739
- And littlest B, yeah, well, no.
- Don't do a speech to me.

422
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:56,321
You are as important in all of this as us.

423
00:26:57,263 --> 00:26:58,489
We love you.

424
00:27:00,016 --> 00:27:01,659
Very cheesy. I know.

425
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:03,458
Jesus.

426
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:05,043
- She is actually vomiting.
- Sorry.

427
00:27:05,063 --> 00:27:07,003
- What the hell, Becka?
- Sorry. Becka.

428
00:27:07,023 --> 00:27:09,589
- In the plant? In the plant.
- To Grace and Ian!

429
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:10,793
Yeah.

430
00:27:15,281 --> 00:27:18,515
- Are you ready for this? For us?
- Yeah.

431
00:27:18,535 --> 00:27:20,678
Yeah. Are you?

432
00:27:21,412 --> 00:27:22,513
Yeah.

433
00:27:38,012 --> 00:27:40,453
- Jesus-- Christ, Ma!
- Sorry. Sorry.

434
00:27:40,473 --> 00:27:45,912
A little something for
your first week, Detective.

435
00:27:49,148 --> 00:27:50,083
What?

436
00:27:52,694 --> 00:27:53,878
How was it?

437
00:27:55,446 --> 00:27:57,090
Okay. Good. Good.

438
00:27:58,324 --> 00:27:59,889
I saw my first dead body.

439
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:02,220
- No, you saw your father when he was in--
- Yeah, I--

440
00:28:02,704 --> 00:28:04,889
I meant my first murdered body.

441
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,604
Found it about a garden, decomposed.

442
00:28:06,624 --> 00:28:09,482
Bet you're glad you did
your driving license now.

443
00:28:09,502 --> 00:28:10,525
What?

444
00:28:10,545 --> 00:28:12,443
No, no, no. Mammy, Mammy,

445
00:28:12,463 --> 00:28:16,025
I didn't make detective
just 'cause I got my driver's license.

446
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:45,852
Is that enough?

447
00:28:45,872 --> 00:28:48,479
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Don't go a little mad.

448
00:28:48,499 --> 00:28:49,564
Ally and I are off.

449
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:51,357
Great to meet you all.

450
00:28:51,377 --> 00:28:53,651
- It was a beautiful wedding. Yeah.
- Lovely to see you. Yeah.

451
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:55,857
- I-- Yeah.
- Yeah.

452
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,114
Do you want some salmon to go?

453
00:28:58,134 --> 00:29:00,486
Would you stop pushing salmon on everyone?

454
00:29:02,055 --> 00:29:03,953
Kids said you were dropping
them off later. That all right?

455
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:05,413
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

456
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:10,121
You guys go and have fun or whatever it is
you do together with each other.

457
00:29:12,982 --> 00:29:15,381
- Right. Catch you later.
- See ya.

458
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:16,925
- See you. Have a good one.
- Bye.

459
00:29:16,945 --> 00:29:18,963
- See you at work, nurse.
- Nice to meet you.

460
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:25,016
It would kill me if Nora was leaving
with a young, fit blonde.

461
00:29:25,036 --> 00:29:26,220
She's not that young.

462
00:29:26,871 --> 00:29:28,097
She's not that fit.

463
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:29,766
I love you, Ian.

464
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:32,518
Let's take a photo before we get gee-eyed.

465
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:35,271
- Salmon sandwich?
- No!

466
00:29:36,297 --> 00:29:37,362
Wait, wait, wait.

467
00:29:37,382 --> 00:29:38,905
- Wait.
- Okay, wait. Hang on.

468
00:29:38,925 --> 00:29:40,949
- Oh, no, wait. That's too...
- It's your thumb, Becka.

469
00:29:40,969 --> 00:29:42,200
- Becka, it's your thumb.
- Cheese.

470
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,785
- Your thumb is in the way.
- Becka--

471
00:29:43,805 --> 00:29:45,990
I'm gonna get my camera. That's terrible.

472
00:30:02,574 --> 00:30:03,763
Urs?

473
00:30:03,783 --> 00:30:04,968
Hi.

474
00:30:05,827 --> 00:30:08,560
- I was just looking for a tampon.
- For all that dust up there?

475
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,889
Up yours, bitch.

476
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:16,651
I'm sorry I said she was fit.

477
00:30:16,671 --> 00:30:18,064
Absolutely fine.

478
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:20,984
That's some news about the egg donor.

479
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:27,115
I'm shitting myself, actually.

480
00:30:28,933 --> 00:30:31,327
I didn't connect with Ruben
for the first two years

481
00:30:31,728 --> 00:30:33,621
and that was without some stranger's egg.

482
00:30:34,147 --> 00:30:36,332
I think Nora's chosen to forget all that.

483
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:41,504
- Hello.
- Jesus, you made us jump.

484
00:30:42,155 --> 00:30:45,800
I was just having a pee...
and a bit of a gander.

485
00:30:46,492 --> 00:30:49,053
It's like a museum, this place.

486
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:53,266
If walls could talk.

487
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:56,144
Am I right, girls?

488
00:30:58,963 --> 00:31:00,064
I'll leave you to it.

489
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,808
Happy?

490
00:31:30,828 --> 00:31:32,388
I'm so happy.

491
00:31:57,105 --> 00:31:58,706
Mind if I cut in for a dance?

492
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:02,507
I'll let my wife answer that.

493
00:32:02,527 --> 00:32:04,754
Of course I'll dance with you, Roger.

494
00:32:31,556 --> 00:32:32,657
You okay?

495
00:32:35,018 --> 00:32:36,828
Remember you said you wouldn't forget me?

496
00:32:37,228 --> 00:32:39,289
I did, and I won't.

497
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,716
Well, your situation's
all changed suddenly, huh?

498
00:32:44,736 --> 00:32:48,506
Well, life can take you by surprise.

499
00:32:50,158 --> 00:32:53,011
Yeah. Mine stood still.

500
00:32:56,623 --> 00:32:59,183
Do you ever think about what we did?

501
00:33:01,461 --> 00:33:04,647
I don't, Roger.
I don't like to think about it.

502
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:11,237
I try not to,
but I carry it with me every day.

503
00:33:15,391 --> 00:33:17,952
Should we rescue her?
He's pissed as a fart.

504
00:33:19,312 --> 00:33:23,041
I'm so sorry.
You'll never know how sorry I am.

505
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:24,709
Grace?

506
00:33:25,735 --> 00:33:29,093
Grace, do you want to--
Should we throw the bouquet?

507
00:33:29,113 --> 00:33:30,428
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

508
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:32,342
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah, go on, love.

509
00:33:33,701 --> 00:33:37,388
Okay. Here we go, ladies.

510
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:39,812
Molly. Molly.

511
00:33:39,832 --> 00:33:41,392
Come on, girls!

512
00:33:43,378 --> 00:33:45,313
Get in there.

513
00:33:46,506 --> 00:33:48,738
Who's gonna be next?

514
00:33:48,758 --> 00:33:50,031
- It's gonna be me!
- Ready?

515
00:33:50,051 --> 00:33:52,654
- It's gonna be me!
- All the single ladies.

516
00:33:53,054 --> 00:33:54,405
Grace!

517
00:34:03,565 --> 00:34:06,626
Rogey, I got it! I caught it!

518
00:34:07,402 --> 00:34:09,545
We've got something to celebrate!

519
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:16,970
Well, what do you know?
Hope springs eternal in the human breast.

520
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:20,019
- So aggressive.
- Yeah.

521
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:21,057
Are you okay?

522
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:44,622
Sir.

523
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:49,923
Sorry.

524
00:34:49,943 --> 00:34:52,427
- What do you want?
- Do you want me to get you some water?

525
00:34:52,447 --> 00:34:54,095
No. Talk.

526
00:34:54,115 --> 00:34:55,800
Forensics have got back at us.

527
00:34:57,035 --> 00:35:00,018
After three days?
That's a record for that lot.

528
00:35:00,038 --> 00:35:02,854
Well, I personally lit a fire
under their arses, demanded--

529
00:35:02,874 --> 00:35:03,938
Just tell me.

530
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:07,483
Yes. Well, there's more to come,
but they've identified the body.

531
00:35:07,503 --> 00:35:09,897
It's George Williams,
John Paul Williams's father.

532
00:35:11,299 --> 00:35:12,822
Well, I could've told us that.

533
00:35:12,842 --> 00:35:15,069
The bloody suitcase could've told us that.

534
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,155
- Anything else?
- Not yet.

535
00:35:17,555 --> 00:35:19,615
But should we inform
the nearest next of kin?

536
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:21,873
Yeah, yeah. Do that.

537
00:35:21,893 --> 00:35:23,995
The next of kin is Grace Williams, sir.

538
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:39,093
Rogey?

539
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,721
Rogey?

540
00:35:44,624 --> 00:35:46,184
Are you home, Rogey?

541
00:35:51,714 --> 00:35:53,066
Why didn't you answer me?

542
00:35:53,675 --> 00:35:56,658
There's something going on
up at the Williams's old place.

543
00:35:56,678 --> 00:35:59,244
I tried calling Grace. Police everywhere.

544
00:35:59,264 --> 00:36:00,662
What do you mean?

545
00:36:00,682 --> 00:36:03,248
What do you mean, "what do I mean"?
Are you awake?

546
00:36:03,268 --> 00:36:06,042
And that's the trouble
when you rise at 03:00.

547
00:36:06,062 --> 00:36:07,246
Angelica.

548
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:11,548
I mean, the Guards, they've got
the whole place cordoned off.

549
00:36:11,568 --> 00:36:16,297
I mean, everyone is in hazmat gear,
like ET has just bloody landed.

550
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,051
What's wrong with you?

551
00:36:21,452 --> 00:36:22,553
Nothing.

552
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,433
Do you know something about it?

553
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:29,852
How would I?

554
00:37:20,428 --> 00:37:21,529
Hey.

555
00:37:22,096 --> 00:37:23,656
Where are you, Trotsky?

556
00:38:20,738 --> 00:38:22,720
You're lucky you caught me.

557
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,888
This won't take long.

558
00:38:23,908 --> 00:38:25,385
Please.

559
00:38:26,578 --> 00:38:28,846
- Can I ask, Mrs. Williams--
- It's Mrs. Reilly.

560
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:31,479
Married again? Congrats.

561
00:38:31,499 --> 00:38:34,602
Yeah, I thought I spotted his clubs
out in the hallway, actually.

562
00:38:35,003 --> 00:38:37,188
A Cobra Fly XL man?

563
00:38:38,882 --> 00:38:41,359
Very nice. Yeah.

564
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:45,243
Can I ask you, when you last saw
your father-in-law, Mrs. Reilly?

565
00:38:45,263 --> 00:38:46,661
My father-in-law?

566
00:38:46,681 --> 00:38:49,117
Your late husband's father,
George Williams.

567
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,661
Years, I suppose.

568
00:38:52,145 --> 00:38:56,004
He walked out on his wife, Minna--
God-- more than a decade ago.

569
00:38:56,024 --> 00:38:58,214
And did you have any contact
with him after he left?

570
00:38:58,234 --> 00:38:59,836
No. Why would I?

571
00:39:03,406 --> 00:39:05,174
Do you recognize this?

572
00:39:09,037 --> 00:39:10,013
It's a suitcase.

573
00:39:10,747 --> 00:39:11,973
Yeah, I know...

574
00:39:12,874 --> 00:39:15,935
I know it's a suitcase. Yeah.
Have you seen it before?

575
00:39:16,836 --> 00:39:17,901
Don't think so.

576
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:21,905
My suitcase could go
round an airport carousel five times

577
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:23,656
and I wouldn't be able to
pick it out of a lineup.

578
00:39:23,676 --> 00:39:26,446
I'm sorry. What has this got to do
with my father-in-law?

579
00:39:26,846 --> 00:39:28,661
Well, it looks like we found him.

580
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:30,830
Really? How is he?

581
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,207
He's not good.

582
00:39:32,227 --> 00:39:34,537
No. We found him dismembered
in that suitcase.

583
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:36,753
What?

584
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:38,833
Yeah, in the pond
of the Williams's family home.

585
00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:42,295
I don't understand.

586
00:39:43,196 --> 00:39:44,594
Are you saying he was murdered?

587
00:39:44,614 --> 00:39:46,221
It's unlikely to be an accident.

588
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:48,551
We're still in the middle of forensics.

589
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:52,305
Yeah, I can see you're in shock.
Is there anyone home with you?

590
00:39:53,623 --> 00:39:55,605
I think that's my husband back now.

591
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,357
Great. Well, we'll head off, so...

592
00:39:57,377 --> 00:40:01,319
Just needed to pass on the news,
you being the closest living next of kin.

593
00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:02,523
Yeah.

594
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:09,744
Hello.

595
00:40:09,764 --> 00:40:13,915
Straight up the stairs.
Yeah, I have a teen myself.

596
00:40:13,935 --> 00:40:16,209
It's a mystery to me
what they do up there.

597
00:40:16,229 --> 00:40:18,920
- Detective Inspector Loftus.
- Right.

598
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,334
- Detective Houlihan--
- We'll get out of your hair, so...

599
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:22,835
Come on.

600
00:40:24,153 --> 00:40:26,089
- What the--
- It's nothing. It's fine.

601
00:40:30,118 --> 00:40:32,934
How did your insurance claim
pan out in the end, by the way?

602
00:40:32,954 --> 00:40:34,102
Sorry?

603
00:40:34,122 --> 00:40:35,937
Your husband's life insurance.

604
00:40:35,957 --> 00:40:37,517
What has that got to do with you?

605
00:40:38,209 --> 00:40:42,105
Well, I'm the man who signed off on
Mr. Williams's exhumation, Mrs. Reilly.

606
00:40:42,505 --> 00:40:45,113
And I haven't heard the last of it,
to tell you the truth.

607
00:40:45,133 --> 00:40:47,198
So actually, it has a lot to do with me.

608
00:40:47,218 --> 00:40:50,196
They all call him Snatcher,
like body snatcher because of--

609
00:40:56,978 --> 00:40:58,162
I withdrew the claim.

610
00:40:59,063 --> 00:41:02,172
John Paul, Mr. Williams, took his life.

611
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:04,090
I didn't want my daughter
knowing about it.

612
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,462
I didn't want his suicide
getting out there.

613
00:41:06,988 --> 00:41:08,089
So I withdrew.

614
00:41:08,948 --> 00:41:11,217
It's a lot of money to say goodbye to.

615
00:41:13,453 --> 00:41:15,388
I didn't feel like I had a choice.

616
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:18,271
No. Of course.

617
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:22,145
Well, my condolences
and my congratulations.

618
00:41:25,632 --> 00:41:28,943
I'm off to The Gravedigger's.
You can drive yourself home from there.

619
00:41:38,394 --> 00:41:39,626
What was that all about?

620
00:41:39,646 --> 00:41:43,458
What? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
Just let me get the oven on.

621
00:41:44,526 --> 00:41:46,586
Why were the Guards here, Grace?

622
00:41:52,825 --> 00:41:55,887
Hey. Why were the Guards here?

623
00:41:57,455 --> 00:41:59,312
There's a dead body been found.

624
00:41:59,332 --> 00:42:02,560
What? Where?

625
00:42:03,169 --> 00:42:05,146
At John Paul's old place. His father.

626
00:42:06,172 --> 00:42:08,780
I'm the only living next of kin,
so, it's awful.

627
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,736
But it's nothing to do with us.
It's just an awful, awful thing.

628
00:42:13,555 --> 00:42:14,781
What's for dinner, Mam?

629
00:42:16,391 --> 00:42:18,248
Can you handle goujons again?

630
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:19,494
Yeah, all right.

631
00:42:30,238 --> 00:42:32,632
I don't believe her, sir. About the claim.

632
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,099
An odd way to commit suicide, all right.

633
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,762
You should say "died by suicide."

634
00:42:38,162 --> 00:42:38,977
What?

635
00:42:38,997 --> 00:42:41,104
"Commit" implies that it's a crime or,
like, it's a choice.

636
00:42:41,124 --> 00:42:42,063
And it's not really a choice.

637
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:43,815
- And, of course--
- But it didn't fecking happen, did it?

638
00:42:43,835 --> 00:42:45,436
So calm your ham.

639
00:42:49,757 --> 00:42:50,858
Why is she lying?

640
00:42:51,551 --> 00:42:54,862
Do you think she offed him, sir?
I mean, she was very quick to remarry.

641
00:43:05,231 --> 00:43:07,333
Yeah, no, don't say that.

642
00:43:20,747 --> 00:43:22,390
Annoying little bastard.

643
00:43:31,925 --> 00:43:34,741
<i>You've called Thomas Claffin.
Leave a message.</i>

644
00:43:34,761 --> 00:43:37,113
Detective Inspector Fergal Loftus here.

645
00:43:37,555 --> 00:43:40,283
I need to talk to you ASAP
about the Garvey sisters.

646
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,577
You and your lanky brother.

647
00:43:46,898 --> 00:43:47,999
Yeah?

648
00:43:52,403 --> 00:43:53,927
<i>What, back from the pit?</i>

649
00:43:53,947 --> 00:43:55,506
<i>Like, that's midfield.</i>

650
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:01,017
Jesus. Do you want me to--

651
00:44:01,037 --> 00:44:02,936
No. Sorry, sorry. I'll get it.

652
00:44:02,956 --> 00:44:04,687
- All right. Mind yourself.
- Yeah.

653
00:44:04,707 --> 00:44:05,892
Yeah.

654
00:44:12,382 --> 00:44:13,483
Uh-oh.

655
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:40,551
Wait.

656
00:44:42,161 --> 00:44:43,262
Roger.

657
00:44:51,004 --> 00:44:53,611
I'm sorry, Grace. I--
Sure, I'll talk to you another time.

658
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,941
What's going on?

659
00:44:56,801 --> 00:44:58,366
There's a body been found
at the Williams's place.

660
00:44:58,386 --> 00:45:00,822
I know, but that's nothing to do with us.

661
00:45:03,308 --> 00:45:04,993
I'm thinking of going to the police.

662
00:45:07,061 --> 00:45:08,459
I need to unburden myself.

663
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,587
What? No, why would you do that?

664
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,297
'Cause it's just a matter of time.

665
00:45:12,317 --> 00:45:15,378
I read about these things.
It's better to come clean now.

666
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:17,839
I'll tell 'em what he did.

667
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:19,888
- I'll say what I saw.
- Roger, you're scaring me.

668
00:45:19,908 --> 00:45:21,431
You could unburden yourself too, you know?

669
00:45:21,451 --> 00:45:23,636
No, no, no!

670
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:28,474
It's not just ourselves you'll be hurting.
It's Blanaid. It's my sisters.

671
00:45:29,542 --> 00:45:31,816
You have to hold fast, Roger.

672
00:45:31,836 --> 00:45:36,274
It was our secret. It can still be ours.

673
00:45:36,674 --> 00:45:38,698
Please. Please. Please.

674
00:45:38,718 --> 00:45:42,488
Please, Roger. Please. Please. Please.

675
00:46:09,374 --> 00:46:10,892
You looking for this?

676
00:46:18,925 --> 00:46:20,109
What's going on?

677
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,738
I could ask you the same thing.

678
00:46:26,849 --> 00:46:28,951
I'm a woman of the church, Roger.

679
00:46:30,353 --> 00:46:32,038
I'm in the guilt industry.

680
00:46:34,315 --> 00:46:35,833
I know guilt when I see it.

681
00:46:39,404 --> 00:46:40,588
Talk to me, Roger.

682
00:46:49,539 --> 00:46:50,848
Where's Blanaid?

683
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:52,684
She's gone up to bed.

684
00:47:04,762 --> 00:47:07,365
I have to tell you something,
and I'm a bit scared.

685
00:47:09,142 --> 00:47:10,748
Don't be. Hey, y--

686
00:47:10,768 --> 00:47:12,870
Hey, you can tell me anything.

687
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:27,515
He-- He... raped Eva.

688
00:47:27,535 --> 00:47:30,305
He-- He raped my sister.

689
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:35,101
He... abused me.

690
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:38,568
I lost my mind, I think.
I don't know what I was doing.

691
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:41,899
What do you mean? Who abused you?

692
00:47:43,218 --> 00:47:46,821
John Paul. John Paul.

693
00:48:13,915 --> 00:48:15,224
I killed him.

694
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,023
I killed my husband.

695
00:48:31,641 --> 00:48:33,242
Did you hear what I said?

696
00:48:36,563 --> 00:48:38,081
You didn't kill him, Gracie.

697
00:48:41,025 --> 00:48:42,210
I did.

698
00:48:46,406 --> 00:48:47,507
And Roger?

699
00:48:48,324 --> 00:48:49,467
He knows.

700
00:48:53,371 --> 00:48:55,556
He says he's gonna tell the police.

701
00:49:03,882 --> 00:49:06,109
Say something, Ian. Talk to me, please.

702
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:09,862
Please, please, please.

703
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:14,701
Jesus Christ.

704
00:49:19,981 --> 00:49:21,291
What are you doing?

705
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,465
Don't look at me like that.

706
00:49:24,485 --> 00:49:25,967
I think I need to get some air.

707
00:49:25,987 --> 00:49:27,969
No, no. You... Don't walk away from me.

708
00:49:27,989 --> 00:49:29,512
I can't talk to you like this.

709
00:49:29,532 --> 00:49:32,510
Please. Please don't leave me. Please.

710
00:50:25,296 --> 00:50:26,397
Eva!

711
00:50:31,844 --> 00:50:32,945
Oi!

712
00:50:33,638 --> 00:50:34,947
You're not going into work?

713
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:36,491
Breakfast meeting.

714
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:38,915
Jesus. They're getting
their money's worth.

715
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:40,041
Cheeky bitch.

716
00:50:40,061 --> 00:50:41,251
We're off to Cork now.

717
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,962
What? No, no.

718
00:50:43,982 --> 00:50:46,793
We've eaten all the smoked salmon, Eva.
It's time to go.

719
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,344
Jesus. Why do you always jump
when someone comes to the door?

720
00:50:51,364 --> 00:50:53,091
We didn't get many visitors as kids.

721
00:50:53,491 --> 00:50:54,425
What?

722
00:50:57,954 --> 00:50:59,055
Bla.

723
00:50:59,497 --> 00:51:01,437
It's very early, honey. Are you okay?

724
00:51:01,457 --> 00:51:03,106
Come here. What's happened?
What's happened?

725
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:05,436
- Ian's gone.
- What do you mean he's gone?

726
00:51:05,879 --> 00:51:07,397
Mam won't stop crying.
