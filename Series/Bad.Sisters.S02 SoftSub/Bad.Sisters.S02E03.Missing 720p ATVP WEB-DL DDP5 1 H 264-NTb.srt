1
00:01:03,877 --> 00:01:06,396
Come here. Okay.

2
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,729
Hey, Eva.

3
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:45,440
Eva, it's me.
I'm-- I really need your help.

4
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,270
I'm so sorry.

5
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:49,611
Please call me back.

6
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:50,815
Play it again.

7
00:01:52,884 --> 00:01:54,282
Hey, Eva.

8
00:01:54,302 --> 00:01:57,702
Eva, it's me.
I'm-- I really need your help.

9
00:01:57,722 --> 00:01:59,115
I'm so sorry.

10
00:01:59,807 --> 00:02:01,492
Please call me back.

11
00:02:02,352 --> 00:02:03,953
Why was she asking for help?

12
00:02:05,522 --> 00:02:06,956
Hey, Eva.

13
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,423
Eva, it's me.
I'm-- I really need your help.

14
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:11,753
I'm so sorry.

15
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:14,130
Please call me back.

16
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:31,916
What's this?

17
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,419
I noticed
you hadn't brought breakfast.

18
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:38,756
Excuse me for not packing
hash browns to a crash scene.

19
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:41,431
We spooked her.

20
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:44,762
Yeah, well,
she was looking pretty guilty, sir.

21
00:03:46,164 --> 00:03:48,141
She knew we were onto her, so she bolted.

22
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:53,896
What a bleeding mess.

23
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:07,540
What happens when the person
you're questioning just dies?

24
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,668
Well, it depends on who and how.

25
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:13,541
- Grace Reilly and in a car crash--
- Yeah, I know.

26
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:17,878
Rake of unanswered questions
and a heap of paperwork, that's what.

27
00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:21,346
And a young girl left with no parents.

28
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,217
Poor wee thing.

29
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:25,803
My ma went missing when I was 12.

30
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:28,853
Said she was gonna go to Nottingham
to see her brother for his birthday,

31
00:04:28,873 --> 00:04:30,975
but when we called,

32
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:33,149
he said that he wasn't having
a birthday party

33
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:35,151
and he hadn't seen my ma in months.

34
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:37,779
I'd feel a lot more sorry for you
if I couldn't hear your food

35
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,609
working its way around your mouth.

36
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:42,695
Sorry.

37
00:04:43,888 --> 00:04:45,578
It's fine now though.

38
00:04:45,598 --> 00:04:48,868
When I made detective
she booked us a spa weekend.

39
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:51,704
Have you got kids, sir?

40
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:55,041
Daughter. Twelve.

41
00:04:55,692 --> 00:04:56,714
Twelve daughters?

42
00:04:56,734 --> 00:04:59,551
No. Who do you think I am?

43
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:01,302
Boris bloody Johnson?

44
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:03,137
I've got one daughter.

45
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:04,842
She's 12.

46
00:05:05,785 --> 00:05:07,141
Best kid you could meet.

47
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:09,060
Top of her class.

48
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,515
So she's first year?

49
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:12,600
Where is she going to secondary school?

50
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:16,104
Australia.

51
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:20,900
Oh, sorry.

52
00:05:22,343 --> 00:05:26,406
Who goes on the run with nothing,
daughter in bed?

53
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:30,326
What in the hell was she thinking?

54
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:37,172
What are you doing?

55
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:39,377
I was trying to get ahold of Ian.

56
00:05:41,196 --> 00:05:44,470
- Well, I don't want to say it, but I--
- That was group hysteria.

57
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,265
That was insane.
I don't know what we were thinking.

58
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:50,513
He has to come back.
He has to, hasn't he? She's--

59
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:57,228
I just can't see
how she crashed on a quiet road.

60
00:05:58,129 --> 00:05:59,736
Eva. Will you stop doing that?

61
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:04,199
I just-- I can't take a breath.
Something's caught.

62
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:08,703
Okay. The last time someone died
there was 18 years ago, drink driving.

63
00:06:08,723 --> 00:06:12,201
What difference does it make
who else died there?

64
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,125
Was she a bit out of it?

65
00:06:14,145 --> 00:06:15,919
She'd never drink and drive.

66
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,921
She got a passive high off a joint once

67
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:21,049
at Tommy Doyle's house
and refused to cycle home.

68
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:23,087
She'd barely take a paracetamol.

69
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:26,716
Could she have? She was pretty riled up.

70
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:30,219
I have to get some air.

71
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,620
Come on.

72
00:06:58,106 --> 00:06:59,540
Come on.

73
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:02,961
Shit.

74
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,226
I can't look at any documents now. Sorry.

75
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:23,069
Right. Yeah. Well, I'll try and keep
any sudden family tragedies

76
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:25,191
to a more convenient quarter.

77
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:35,076
Sorry, Martin. I got cut off there.

78
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:38,371
Yeah. Stick your job up your hole.

79
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,626
I just handed in my notice.

80
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:50,930
Hey, honey. Do you want some cereal?

81
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,427
You didn't have any dinner last night.

82
00:07:53,161 --> 00:07:55,638
Is Ian on his way?
Have any of you spoken to him?

83
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:59,230
I'm sure he'll be back soon, love.

84
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,316
Mam drove him away. I bet you anything.

85
00:08:01,336 --> 00:08:02,984
Probably drunk. Psycho.

86
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:04,611
- What the hell, Blanaid?
- Watch your mouth.

87
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:06,321
She's devastated.
She's just saying things.

88
00:08:06,341 --> 00:08:08,448
Stop telling me how I'm feeling.

89
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:10,153
You don't even know.

90
00:08:14,182 --> 00:08:17,327
Oh, Jesus Christ. Hello?

91
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:22,790
Yeah, Mr. Reilly isn't here. He's--

92
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:26,461
Right, well, we can identify--

93
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:29,714
One of us can do it. Okay, thanks.

94
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,218
They want us to identify the body.

95
00:08:35,786 --> 00:08:36,971
Please don't say "the body."

96
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:42,977
You all right, Urs?

97
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:46,189
You're very vacant.

98
00:08:46,756 --> 00:08:47,695
Sorry.

99
00:08:47,715 --> 00:08:48,988
Yeah. Snap out of it, Urs.

100
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:50,657
It's not like your sister just died.

101
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:52,700
- Jesus Christ, Bibi.
- What's the matter with you?

102
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,787
She hasn't spilled a tear,
just bloody quips all day. It's mental.

103
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,497
Maybe if you stopped crying
for a millisecond,

104
00:08:57,517 --> 00:08:59,290
there'd be space
for somebody else to be sad.

105
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,042
You're such a horrible bitch.

106
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,372
I can do it.

107
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:04,666
I can identify the body.

108
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:07,048
Well, we need to discuss--

109
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:10,885
Well, look, somebody has to identify her.
Ian's not here. I'm a nurse.

110
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:12,256
I can do it.

111
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:31,943
- I could go in with you, you know, but--
- Eva, please just let me do this.

112
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:35,326
I've never felt more worthless
in my life to all of you.

113
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:37,323
Completely useless.

114
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:42,370
- I can handle this. Let me handle it.
- Okay.

115
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:44,956
Whenever you're ready.

116
00:09:49,194 --> 00:09:51,254
What the fuck is he doing here?

117
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:54,090
What will I do if they ask about Ian?

118
00:09:54,657 --> 00:09:57,557
You just say we're grieving.
We're grieving.

119
00:09:57,577 --> 00:09:58,636
Okay.

120
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,184
I'm sorry for your troubles.

121
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:08,234
It's standard practice

122
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:12,525
for a spouse to identify the deceased
as the nearest next of kin.

123
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:19,432
Actually, Fergal,
any news on toxicology yet?

124
00:10:19,515 --> 00:10:21,956
Why? Do you think she was intoxicated?

125
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:23,661
No. I don't.

126
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:26,419
Just maybe you could give me the heads-up

127
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:27,879
when the results come through?

128
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,966
Well, you know, we met. We got on so well,
so I thought maybe--

129
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:33,510
We chatted for 15 minutes.

130
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,263
And you gave me a drunk snog,
and you said "Donald" 17 times,

131
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:39,010
and you never returned my text.

132
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,310
It's "Donal."

133
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,520
We can go through now.

134
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,813
Miss Garvey,
has Ian Reilly still not reappeared?

135
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,310
Look, we don't know where he is.

136
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:49,646
We're grieving.

137
00:11:16,948 --> 00:11:20,468
What should we dress her in?
Should it be a jacket and skirt or…

138
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:26,813
Either of these?

139
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,398
- Yeah. Nice.
- Good. Yeah.

140
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:29,519
Lovely.

141
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:32,694
No. Stop. Okay?

142
00:11:32,714 --> 00:11:37,485
We can't just all go inside of ourselves
and become fucking polite to each other.

143
00:11:37,886 --> 00:11:39,404
No matter what.

144
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:41,322
So, come on.

145
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:43,288
What do you think?

146
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:48,037
Okay. I hope she gets the assistant
manager's job at the petrol station.

147
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:58,303
Do you remember when she--

148
00:11:58,323 --> 00:12:00,180
Do you remember when she made herself

149
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,093
a pair of leather trousers
out of a pattern?

150
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:05,596
That girl loved a bit of leather.

151
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:08,933
Little matching bolero.

152
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:20,445
You should add that to the eulogy.

153
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:23,364
Oh, God. The eulogy.

154
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:26,164
Do we have to make a speech?

155
00:12:26,184 --> 00:12:31,372
No, can't write a bloody best man speech.

156
00:12:32,315 --> 00:12:34,797
Try and sum her up
in four paragraphs for everyone.

157
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:38,468
No. We'll just mourn her in our own way.

158
00:12:38,488 --> 00:12:40,720
Yeah, we'll sit around the fire,
drink a bottle of whiskey

159
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,134
and remember her properly.

160
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,928
When everyone pisses off
and leaves us alone.

161
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:49,474
Yeah. Sounds okay.

162
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:57,273
What about this one?

163
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:02,033
It's a bit booby, Becka.

164
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:04,661
Why would she wear that
as her final outfit?

165
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:06,366
Because she was a ride.

166
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,868
She was only just starting to notice.

167
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,998
Why were you laughing so much?

168
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:17,335
We were just
picking an outfit for your mum.

169
00:13:17,902 --> 00:13:20,004
You don't need an outfit to be burned in.

170
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:32,058
She wore this on my 13th birthday
in The Gresham.

171
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,894
She said she felt like
Cate Blanchett in it, so…

172
00:13:41,718 --> 00:13:43,319
I just want to scoop her up.

173
00:13:50,894 --> 00:13:52,870
I wish we'd never started this.

174
00:13:53,271 --> 00:13:54,252
What?

175
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:55,832
Never went after the prick.

176
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:58,334
That we left well enough alone.

177
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:01,045
Well, it wasn't well enough, was it?

178
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:06,050
None of this would have happened
if we'd just stayed the hell out of it.

179
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,198
That organ is awful.

180
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:32,076
Why did we let them choose it?

181
00:14:32,477 --> 00:14:34,876
Bloody set menu funeral.

182
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:38,166
Can we just survive this?

183
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:49,552
Oh, God.

184
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:54,604
Can you believe that this is happening?

185
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:56,731
I just can't believe this is happening.

186
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:57,935
Thank you.

187
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,146
Can you believe it's happening?

188
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:02,070
- Just--
- How you doing, Roger?

189
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,026
He is a husk of a man.

190
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:07,158
And our hearts are broken.

191
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:09,619
Well, let us know if you need
a shoulder to cry on, Angelica, won't you?

192
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,907
I will.

193
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:12,997
I'm sorry.

194
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:14,160
Grief thief.

195
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:17,210
Come sit down the back there.

196
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,128
- No, I'm grand here, thanks.
- Angelica.

197
00:15:19,148 --> 00:15:22,669
Sorry, Angelica. This is for Blanaid
and close family if you wouldn't mind.

198
00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:25,129
Plenty of seats back there.

199
00:15:26,948 --> 00:15:28,383
Can you move?

200
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:35,098
Yep. Of course.

201
00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:42,105
Well, everyone's turned up.

202
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:45,358
Except for Grace's own husband.

203
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:56,035
Are you okay?

204
00:15:57,896 --> 00:16:01,296
Do you want to come sit here? Come sit.

205
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:03,084
No, thanks.

206
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:23,021
Who's that?

207
00:16:26,257 --> 00:16:27,525
Matt Claffin.

208
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:30,200
He's Grace's insurer.

209
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,117
Wow.

210
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:33,406
Geez, that was nice of him to show up.

211
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:35,950
Gone above and beyond.

212
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,556
You see, I'd do that photo.

213
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:11,777
Thank you for being with us today.

214
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:16,995
For the final… of Grace Reilly née Garvey.

215
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:18,450
May she rest in peace.

216
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:22,705
As we bid farewell to our dear sister…

217
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:27,210
Blanaid and her sisters.

218
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:42,600
What the hell is going on
with that priest?

219
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,019
He had a stroke last year.

220
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:47,021
He had a--

221
00:17:47,922 --> 00:17:50,733
Oh, great. Well, that's just great.

222
00:18:23,374 --> 00:18:25,184
Through Christ, our Lord. Amen.

223
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:30,481
And now we'll hear from Grace's family.

224
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:33,865
- What?
- Absolutely not.

225
00:18:33,885 --> 00:18:36,242
- I am not saying something.
- Someone needs to go up.

226
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:37,869
- We need to--
- I don't--

227
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:39,037
No, I don't want to.

228
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:40,658
No, we said we weren't doing that.

229
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,537
Yeah, we didn't know bloody Mumbles
would be leading prayers, did we?

230
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:50,798
Oh, Grace
Just hold me in your arms

231
00:18:50,818 --> 00:18:54,380
And let this moment linger

232
00:18:54,864 --> 00:19:00,637
They'll take me out at dawn
And I will die

233
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,311
With all my love

234
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:09,103
I place this wedding ring
Upon your finger

235
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:13,488
There won't be time to share our love

236
00:19:13,508 --> 00:19:17,362
So we must say goodbye

237
00:19:18,388 --> 00:19:22,914
There won't be time to share our love

238
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:26,746
So we must say goodbye

239
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:39,848
So sorry for your loss.

240
00:19:39,868 --> 00:19:41,302
Thank you.

241
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:44,931
Hi. Thank you for coming.

242
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:49,602
Thank you so much.
This is very kind of you.

243
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:51,276
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

244
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:52,981
Thanks for coming.

245
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:55,108
Have a lovely day.

246
00:19:55,842 --> 00:19:57,532
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

247
00:19:57,552 --> 00:19:58,861
Thanks for coming. Yeah.

248
00:20:01,556 --> 00:20:03,574
- Thank you, Mary.
- I'm really sorry.

249
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:08,579
Oh, thank God.

250
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:19,762
Where the hell have you been?

251
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:21,181
Where were you?

252
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:23,636
Why didn't you phone us, you fucking dick?

253
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,682
We had a fight. Grace told me something.

254
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,690
It made me very nervous.
I panicked and left.

255
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,860
No, the handshaking is closed, okay?
No more handshaking.

256
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,278
Thanks a million. Sorry.

257
00:20:35,298 --> 00:20:37,108
What did Grace tell you?

258
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:40,069
She told me that she killed John Paul.

259
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:43,072
She told me everything.

260
00:20:45,016 --> 00:20:45,992
Oh, God.

261
00:20:47,435 --> 00:20:49,959
Just wanted to offer you all
our condolences.

262
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:51,461
And to you, Mr. Reilly.

263
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:52,795
Thank you.

264
00:20:52,815 --> 00:20:54,459
Glad you made it back from the golf.

265
00:20:56,194 --> 00:20:58,635
We'd love to speak to you
as soon as possible.

266
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:00,840
With respect for the situation, of course.

267
00:21:01,908 --> 00:21:04,224
Well, can we just speak now, get it done?

268
00:21:04,244 --> 00:21:07,101
Here? Yeah, if that's okay with you. Yeah.

269
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:08,222
Yeah.

270
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:15,276
- This is bad.
- Is he gonna tell them?

271
00:21:15,296 --> 00:21:17,570
Oh, Jesus. Jesus Christ. Jesus.

272
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,983
He wouldn't do that.

273
00:21:19,634 --> 00:21:23,326
Look, Grace and I had an argument.

274
00:21:23,346 --> 00:21:26,913
Nothing major, but, yeah,
I went to stay with a pal.

275
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:28,164
Who?

276
00:21:28,184 --> 00:21:30,458
Cathal Leary. He lives in Kildare.

277
00:21:30,478 --> 00:21:32,001
I can give you his number.

278
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:33,920
Excuse me for prying on a day like this,

279
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,840
but, well, it would be
really handy for us to know.

280
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,337
What did you and your wife fight about?

281
00:21:40,989 --> 00:21:43,049
A bicker about nothing that escalated.

282
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:45,265
You weren't married that long, right?

283
00:21:45,285 --> 00:21:46,850
Can I ask how you met?

284
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,934
Through the sisters?

285
00:21:47,954 --> 00:21:51,641
No. Online, the old fashioned way.

286
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:55,108
So were you aware that
her father-in-law was murdered

287
00:21:55,128 --> 00:21:57,981
and was dead for nearly ten years
while they spent his pension?

288
00:21:59,507 --> 00:22:01,823
I don't know why all this
is on my shoulders.

289
00:22:01,843 --> 00:22:04,534
I didn't know her previous husband
or her father-in-law,

290
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:06,619
and I only met the sisters last year.

291
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:09,534
And I don't think
this is appropriate right now.

292
00:22:10,268 --> 00:22:11,583
Are we done?

293
00:22:11,603 --> 00:22:12,996
Absolutely.

294
00:22:20,153 --> 00:22:21,629
He's dodgy, right?

295
00:22:22,614 --> 00:22:23,715
Yeah.

296
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:29,470
Yeah.

297
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:41,112
We should go in.
There's people here already.

298
00:22:41,132 --> 00:22:42,775
What did the Guards ask you?

299
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,903
Can I ask a question instead?

300
00:22:47,513 --> 00:22:48,698
Did you help her?

301
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:52,201
We covered it up.

302
00:22:56,731 --> 00:23:00,084
Am I expected
to just keep quiet about all this?

303
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:04,219
Oh, Ian. Jesus.
I'm sorry for your loss, man.

304
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:05,303
Thanks, Joe.

305
00:23:05,323 --> 00:23:06,549
God.

306
00:23:09,494 --> 00:23:11,351
- Joe, you're fine. We'll do that.
- No, it's grand.

307
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:12,764
- I'll bring these out for you.
- Joe.

308
00:23:13,248 --> 00:23:15,188
Oh, God! Sorry. Jesus.

309
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,273
Can you just leave it there?
We're talking.

310
00:23:17,293 --> 00:23:19,943
Sorry, lads. I hope I haven't--

311
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:21,439
Can you just leave it?

312
00:23:25,134 --> 00:23:26,824
- Sorry. No.
- Sorry, Joe.

313
00:23:26,844 --> 00:23:29,947
Just go make a drink,
and we'll be in in a minute.

314
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:33,951
I just need a pause.

315
00:23:34,644 --> 00:23:36,663
Then I'll figure out what to do, okay?

316
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:40,917
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go see Bla.

317
00:23:43,194 --> 00:23:44,337
Ian.

318
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,091
- I'm so sorry.
- Can we trust him?

319
00:23:48,575 --> 00:23:49,842
Well, we have to

320
00:23:50,743 --> 00:23:51,844
for now.

321
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:22,583
No, thanks.

322
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:27,839
Shock yourself back to life
with a little bit of sugar.

323
00:24:45,548 --> 00:24:46,941
Beautiful family.

324
00:24:48,927 --> 00:24:52,530
You know, I lost my husband very young.

325
00:24:52,931 --> 00:24:54,157
Eddie.

326
00:24:55,308 --> 00:25:01,247
He used to pick daisies for me
and dry them out in a big book about cars.

327
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,501
He loved cars. Cars and women.

328
00:25:06,778 --> 00:25:08,504
You can never get grief right.

329
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:11,966
I never shed a tear
for my father when he died.

330
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:14,761
I mean, whatever you feel is normal.

331
00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:19,641
I feel guilt.

332
00:25:22,627 --> 00:25:23,936
Why?

333
00:25:25,463 --> 00:25:28,650
You know, Grace loved you very much.
She often mentioned you, Ursula.

334
00:25:31,261 --> 00:25:32,320
Did you talk much?

335
00:25:34,806 --> 00:25:36,449
She was my pal.

336
00:25:39,185 --> 00:25:40,453
Mine too.

337
00:25:46,025 --> 00:25:49,379
See, I know what Grace went through.

338
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:55,760
Sorry, what do you mean?

339
00:25:56,494 --> 00:25:58,888
I know what JP did to her.

340
00:26:00,123 --> 00:26:02,225
And what she did to him.

341
00:26:03,585 --> 00:26:06,693
I just can't understand
what had her so upset.

342
00:26:06,713 --> 00:26:07,986
Having gone through all that.

343
00:26:08,006 --> 00:26:09,816
Just a beautiful life

344
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:11,985
gone.

345
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:15,405
I've never seen her like that.

346
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:18,413
Never. Not even with him.

347
00:26:18,433 --> 00:26:19,784
That's why I--

348
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:23,371
You…

349
00:26:24,939 --> 00:26:26,791
No, just…

350
00:26:28,568 --> 00:26:30,211
I was so worried.

351
00:26:36,618 --> 00:26:42,598
I'm sure you were the best person
to help her in that state.

352
00:26:49,214 --> 00:26:50,857
I offered her something.

353
00:26:56,846 --> 00:26:58,323
Pills.

354
00:27:00,016 --> 00:27:01,826
Just to calm her down.

355
00:27:05,647 --> 00:27:07,457
Well, you're a nurse.

356
00:27:08,024 --> 00:27:10,293
The most natural thing in the world.

357
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:13,421
I think this is my fault.

358
00:27:15,823 --> 00:27:20,219
That which is done in love cannot be bad.

359
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:54,921
Jesus Christ.

360
00:28:00,618 --> 00:28:02,141
Get your feet off the desk.

361
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:03,596
Sorry, sir.

362
00:28:05,748 --> 00:28:07,355
I think I've found something.

363
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:10,692
So, I was doing a bit of digging
into all the Garvey sisters.

364
00:28:10,712 --> 00:28:13,945
Eva left a huge firm
where John Paul Williams worked.

365
00:28:13,965 --> 00:28:18,408
Bibi has been a semipro poker player
for the last two years.

366
00:28:18,428 --> 00:28:19,784
Can you believe that?

367
00:28:19,804 --> 00:28:21,703
Actually, I can.

368
00:28:21,723 --> 00:28:25,284
And Ursula, well,
I'm sure you know all about her, sir.

369
00:28:27,562 --> 00:28:30,790
But look what I found on Becka.

370
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:35,008
What am I looking at?

371
00:28:35,028 --> 00:28:36,504
Matt Claffin.

372
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,845
Ever since we saw him at the funeral,

373
00:28:38,865 --> 00:28:40,842
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about him.

374
00:28:41,534 --> 00:28:43,433
Not like that. Well, a bit like that.

375
00:28:43,453 --> 00:28:45,602
But I went through all his socials.

376
00:28:45,622 --> 00:28:48,021
Becka's been liking
and commenting on his posts,

377
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:49,981
and then all of a sudden
it stopped, right?

378
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:52,812
So, look at this,

379
00:28:53,922 --> 00:28:57,567
Becka's is the same story,
but now it's Matt who's stopped liking.

380
00:28:58,092 --> 00:28:59,736
Stopped liking what?

381
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:03,698
What? No, he stopped liking.

382
00:29:04,265 --> 00:29:05,742
Hang on.

383
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,996
See? There's a heart
from Matt in the comments.

384
00:29:13,775 --> 00:29:15,918
I think they were an item, sir.

385
00:29:16,986 --> 00:29:21,257
We know the Claffins were convinced
that Grace killed John Paul.

386
00:29:22,492 --> 00:29:24,849
But what if Becka was using Matt,

387
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:29,521
like, through womanly wiles,
to get Thomas Claffin to back off?

388
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:31,648
What if the sisters
were all in on it, sir?

389
00:29:31,668 --> 00:29:33,728
What if they all helped with the murder?

390
00:29:36,756 --> 00:29:39,822
Is that a good noise, sir?

391
00:29:39,842 --> 00:29:41,449
It's a neutral noise.

392
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:43,237
Yeah, it's not nothing.

393
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,121
I keep thinking of Ian Reilly at the
funeral trotting off after those sisters.

394
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:48,581
Womanly wiles, sir.

395
00:29:48,601 --> 00:29:50,291
Stop saying womanly wiles.

396
00:29:50,311 --> 00:29:52,085
Yep. Well, should we go and maybe see--

397
00:29:52,105 --> 00:29:53,127
No, we won't.

398
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:56,589
Let's wait for the tox report
that Ursula Garvey is so desperate for.

399
00:29:56,609 --> 00:29:59,629
You just keep your powder dry
if that's possible.

400
00:30:02,532 --> 00:30:03,716
Yes.

401
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:07,892
Hi, Angelica. It's Ursula again.

402
00:30:07,912 --> 00:30:09,477
Sorry for all the calls.

403
00:30:09,497 --> 00:30:11,646
Just wanted to say--

404
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:13,857
It just got a bit intense
last week at the funeral,

405
00:30:13,877 --> 00:30:17,772
so I just wanted to make sure
that we're okay after our chat.

406
00:30:21,801 --> 00:30:23,700
Hey, honey, you on your way over?

407
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,488
I've got your room nearly--

408
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,158
Bla, you have to let me try.

409
00:30:32,312 --> 00:30:34,669
Fine.
Well, I'll pick you up for the swim later.

410
00:30:34,689 --> 00:30:36,416
All the girls are gonna be there.

411
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,382
Right, well,
I'll kidnap you if I have to then.

412
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:40,545
Love you. Bye.

413
00:30:52,373 --> 00:30:53,730
Are we still going to the Forty Foot?

414
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,351
Jesus Christ.

415
00:30:55,877 --> 00:30:57,567
Ursula, what's the matter with you?

416
00:30:57,587 --> 00:30:58,688
Yes.

417
00:31:12,435 --> 00:31:14,245
Please put your chairs away.

418
00:31:19,484 --> 00:31:22,884
Thought Ian might have come.
Do you think he'll be back to group?

419
00:31:22,904 --> 00:31:24,380
How would I know that, Caroline?

420
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,884
Just excuse me a moment.

421
00:31:28,493 --> 00:31:29,969
Someone needs my help.

422
00:31:40,338 --> 00:31:41,439
Hi…

423
00:31:43,508 --> 00:31:45,657
I obviously told you
something quite intense,

424
00:31:45,677 --> 00:31:47,403
and then I couldn't get ahold of you.

425
00:31:48,304 --> 00:31:50,323
I've been calling you for over a week.

426
00:31:50,723 --> 00:31:52,533
I felt like your stalker.

427
00:31:53,226 --> 00:31:54,958
I'm so sorry.

428
00:31:54,978 --> 00:31:57,205
I have just been so busy.

429
00:31:58,106 --> 00:32:03,007
You know, since Grace's passing,
it's just renewed my vigor.

430
00:32:03,027 --> 00:32:04,545
God. Look at this.

431
00:32:05,071 --> 00:32:06,255
Oh, God.

432
00:32:08,366 --> 00:32:12,767
Yeah, okay-- So I just wanted to check,

433
00:32:12,787 --> 00:32:16,224
that you hadn't, you know, told anyone…

434
00:32:18,668 --> 00:32:19,852
about the pills.

435
00:32:24,257 --> 00:32:25,817
Do you see this place?

436
00:32:26,301 --> 00:32:29,868
I mean, it's very precious to me
as it was for your sister.

437
00:32:29,888 --> 00:32:33,830
You know, we cooked
an unholy amount of lasagna in there.

438
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,998
It's home for people

439
00:32:35,018 --> 00:32:38,001
who just don't feel comfortable
anywhere else.

440
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:42,380
You know, it's a stable, safe, good place.

441
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,175
I mean, there are not many places
like that around nowadays.

442
00:32:45,195 --> 00:32:48,469
Yeah. No, absolutely. Well done.

443
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:50,091
Do you see that window?

444
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,764
Just broken.

445
00:32:51,784 --> 00:32:53,349
And the noise from the matches

446
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:58,683
just seeps right through into my group,
into every group, you know?

447
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:03,313
Yeah, I think that window is gonna
stay broken like that all winter.

448
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,277
It would cost 200 euros to solve,
but we just don't have it.

449
00:33:09,677 --> 00:33:12,196
I mean, it's a paltry amount of money.

450
00:33:12,847 --> 00:33:15,371
Yeah, that's not that much money.

451
00:33:15,391 --> 00:33:18,244
No, I mean, not for the quiet.

452
00:33:21,689 --> 00:33:24,000
Surely that's worth it.

453
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,719
Yeah, well, it's meals-on-wheels tonight,

454
00:33:35,537 --> 00:33:37,310
and those carrots
won't julienne themselves

455
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,723
no matter how nicely I ask.

456
00:33:41,626 --> 00:33:44,692
I mean, they told me not to come in

457
00:33:44,712 --> 00:33:49,984
because of what I'm going through,
but the hungry must be fed.

458
00:33:51,803 --> 00:33:53,154
God bless.

459
00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:25,228
Good puck.

460
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,271
Good.

461
00:34:31,843 --> 00:34:32,943
Right.

462
00:34:33,928 --> 00:34:35,029
Hey.

463
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,780
Jesus.

464
00:34:40,142 --> 00:34:41,791
Why didn't you bring her over?

465
00:34:41,811 --> 00:34:44,209
She's been here all week.
You know, I just got her room finished.

466
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:46,963
We were supposed to
be taking her swimming.

467
00:34:46,983 --> 00:34:49,173
She just really wanted to stay put.

468
00:34:49,193 --> 00:34:54,470
It's hard enough trying to look after her
without you just bloody hogging her.

469
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:58,641
The kid wouldn't piss on me if I was
on fire right now let alone listen to me.

470
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:03,188
So next time she comes over,
can you just-- please just send her home?

471
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,647
This is her home.

472
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:07,066
Yeah, I am her stepdad, Eva.

473
00:35:07,086 --> 00:35:09,194
Now, I know
I've not been around that long,

474
00:35:09,214 --> 00:35:11,946
but we had a good thing,
me and Grace and Bla.

475
00:35:11,966 --> 00:35:14,157
It's not safe for her to rely on you.

476
00:35:14,177 --> 00:35:15,742
I don't know what your plans are.

477
00:35:15,762 --> 00:35:18,786
You know, you could be planning
to hotfoot it onto Tinder

478
00:35:18,806 --> 00:35:20,079
and just abandon the whole mess.

479
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:21,497
Tinder?

480
00:35:21,517 --> 00:35:24,250
Jesus wept.
Eva, I'd rather put my dick in a door.

481
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,793
What? In the keyhole or--

482
00:35:25,813 --> 00:35:27,837
What? No, like, slam it in a door.

483
00:35:27,857 --> 00:35:29,876
Right. Well, that makes more sense.

484
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:36,804
We'll get there, you know, day by day.

485
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:42,472
But for now, just let her be here
until the open wound of it all eases.

486
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:45,939
Look, I'm sorry.

487
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:49,062
- I don't want to be controlling it all.
- No, it's grand. It's--

488
00:35:50,964 --> 00:35:55,114
I'm not a mother, but,

489
00:35:55,134 --> 00:35:59,410
you know, Grace wanted me
to step in if the worst happened.

490
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,115
Course she did.

491
00:36:02,308 --> 00:36:03,910
And I know that.

492
00:36:11,234 --> 00:36:13,967
Thanks for not telling
the Guards what we did.

493
00:36:13,987 --> 00:36:17,507
Jesus, that's a weird sentence
to have to say.

494
00:36:20,034 --> 00:36:21,135
But thank you.

495
00:36:23,496 --> 00:36:25,306
You saved our lives.

496
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:28,393
Wish I could have saved Grace.

497
00:36:31,296 --> 00:36:32,689
Yeah, me too.

498
00:36:35,508 --> 00:36:39,862
- What's up?
- I just-- I can't breathe.

499
00:36:40,305 --> 00:36:41,953
I mean, I can obviously breathe.

500
00:36:41,973 --> 00:36:43,992
I just-- I feel like some--

501
00:36:45,435 --> 00:36:46,666
I feel like something's stuck.

502
00:36:46,686 --> 00:36:48,042
It's the shock.

503
00:36:48,062 --> 00:36:50,206
Muscles are all tensed up.

504
00:36:51,191 --> 00:36:54,090
When my sister died, it happened to me.

505
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,216
Oh, Jesus, sorry.

506
00:36:55,236 --> 00:36:58,715
You can release it a bit
if you just-- Here.

507
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,301
Try it.

508
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:07,515
Right, just-- If you--

509
00:37:08,082 --> 00:37:10,852
Now, breathe into your belly.

510
00:37:16,466 --> 00:37:17,442
There.

511
00:37:18,968 --> 00:37:20,111
Thank you.

512
00:37:21,054 --> 00:37:23,953
I'm gonna find better ways to thank you
than just saying thank you all the time.

513
00:37:23,973 --> 00:37:26,623
Chips? Do you have time?

514
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:29,287
For chips? Yeah.

515
00:37:30,605 --> 00:37:33,958
Blanaid, I'm gonna head out for chips.

516
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:37,967
- You say it. She won't come down for me.
- She will.

517
00:37:37,987 --> 00:37:40,173
If not for you, for chips.

518
00:37:42,242 --> 00:37:43,176
Okay.

519
00:37:48,248 --> 00:37:49,437
Bla!

520
00:37:49,457 --> 00:37:50,438
Yeah?

521
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,190
Anything with the chips?

522
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,399
No, I'm all right.

523
00:37:53,419 --> 00:37:55,438
Are you sure? You want scampi?

524
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:57,523
No.

525
00:37:57,924 --> 00:37:58,858
Okay then.

526
00:38:52,353 --> 00:38:53,585
Can't believe Bla's not coming.

527
00:38:53,605 --> 00:38:55,211
I thought it was just you
she hated right now.

528
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:56,963
Why ain't any ye answering your phones?

529
00:38:56,983 --> 00:38:59,048
- Do you look at my messages?
- What's wrong?

530
00:38:59,068 --> 00:39:01,212
I think Grace was in trouble, look.

531
00:39:01,613 --> 00:39:03,136
Are these Gracie's?

532
00:39:03,156 --> 00:39:04,637
- Yeah, look.
- Let me see.

533
00:39:04,657 --> 00:39:07,260
All taken out hours before she died.

534
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:09,012
Look.

535
00:39:09,454 --> 00:39:11,139
That's a shit ton of cash.

536
00:39:11,706 --> 00:39:12,807
Well, where is that cash now?

537
00:39:14,876 --> 00:39:17,895
So she took out 20,000 euro
and left Blanaid?

538
00:39:19,464 --> 00:39:21,404
What the hell
was going on with Gracie, lads?

539
00:39:21,424 --> 00:39:24,402
God knows. Who was that money for?

540
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:27,613
Sorry.

541
00:39:29,182 --> 00:39:31,122
- Ursula, what are you at?
- Ursula.

542
00:39:31,142 --> 00:39:34,078
- Ursula, you have my towel.
- Ursula!

543
00:39:43,071 --> 00:39:44,255
Shit.

544
00:39:52,247 --> 00:39:55,063
- Hey.
- Hey, sorry about the change of plan.

545
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:57,435
I just needed to come home to you.

546
00:39:58,336 --> 00:39:59,817
Urs…

547
00:39:59,837 --> 00:40:03,613
No, I don't--
I mean come home to all of you.

548
00:40:03,633 --> 00:40:06,157
You know, to make an omelet with Michael.

549
00:40:06,177 --> 00:40:08,535
We always used to make omelets
on Wednesdays when you were off.

550
00:40:08,555 --> 00:40:10,156
Yeah, of course. Come on.

551
00:40:11,432 --> 00:40:16,125
Would it be okay if we didn't ask--
Well, I mean, is Ally coming over?

552
00:40:16,145 --> 00:40:18,086
Like, if she wants to, then of course.

553
00:40:18,106 --> 00:40:20,667
But I wanted to talk to you
about something.

554
00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:22,507
Yeah.

555
00:40:22,527 --> 00:40:24,509
She's working anyway,
so I wasn't seeing her tonight.

556
00:40:24,529 --> 00:40:27,345
Why is she working nights?
She doesn't normally work nights.

557
00:40:27,365 --> 00:40:28,591
Don't know. They called her in.

558
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:33,012
Some drama about the requisition book,
some missing pills.

559
00:40:33,746 --> 00:40:35,348
Doing an audit now, I think.

560
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,725
Don't know if the cops
have been called in yet.

561
00:40:40,628 --> 00:40:41,729
Ursula?

562
00:40:49,345 --> 00:40:50,822
Sorry.

563
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:19,189
It's not what it looks like.

564
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:21,357
- It's just a misunderstanding.
- Sorry to interrupt you there,

565
00:41:21,377 --> 00:41:23,938
I just don't want you to make this
any worse for yourself.

566
00:41:26,174 --> 00:41:28,072
Look, I've been working here for decades--

567
00:41:28,092 --> 00:41:31,159
years longer than you, with respect--
and I've never put a foot wrong.

568
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:34,157
Then why would you do
something so reckless, Nurse?

569
00:41:35,016 --> 00:41:37,665
We'll go through the due process,
and you'll have plenty of right to reply.

570
00:41:37,685 --> 00:41:40,538
Are you doing this out of spite?
Because you don't like me?

571
00:41:41,898 --> 00:41:44,000
Why would I not like you?

572
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:02,769
It was for Michael, originally.

573
00:42:04,796 --> 00:42:07,940
He was having nightmares,
and our GP was away all summer.

574
00:42:11,052 --> 00:42:13,409
And one night I took one,

575
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:17,033
and I slept better than I had
since I was a child.

576
00:42:19,185 --> 00:42:20,578
And I couldn't stop.

577
00:42:25,066 --> 00:42:26,793
If I get struck off…

578
00:42:28,945 --> 00:42:32,090
I won't cope. Not now. Not since Grace.

579
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,136
Did Donal know?

580
00:42:40,164 --> 00:42:42,016
We were barely speaking at the time.

581
00:42:44,127 --> 00:42:45,275
Ally, please.

582
00:42:45,295 --> 00:42:46,813
This is illegal.

583
00:42:47,422 --> 00:42:48,773
It's serious, Ursula.

584
00:42:49,716 --> 00:42:50,905
You should go home now.

585
00:42:50,925 --> 00:42:52,115
Ally, I swear, I will--

586
00:42:52,135 --> 00:42:54,362
Go home, Nurse.

587
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,999
Did somebody tip you off about this?

588
00:43:07,275 --> 00:43:08,459
Was it Angelica Collins?

589
00:43:09,235 --> 00:43:10,878
Please, Ally.

590
00:43:27,212 --> 00:43:28,980
Fergal!

591
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:39,162
Can you give us a sec?

592
00:43:39,182 --> 00:43:41,706
No problem. I'll get a Ribena
from the vending machine,

593
00:43:41,726 --> 00:43:43,536
- or an Appletis--
- Yeah, I don't care.

594
00:43:45,438 --> 00:43:47,295
What's happened? Is Jessie okay?

595
00:43:47,315 --> 00:43:50,256
- She's fine. She's at boxing.
- When did she take up boxing?

596
00:43:50,276 --> 00:43:53,671
I'm not here to explain
your daughter's hobbies to you, Fergal.

597
00:43:54,864 --> 00:43:57,597
Nice of you to take
Miss Daisy out for a little spin.

598
00:43:57,617 --> 00:44:00,094
Kept your daddy issues quiet, by the way.

599
00:44:00,787 --> 00:44:02,263
You're my only issue, Fergal.

600
00:44:02,872 --> 00:44:04,349
Why haven't you signed the papers?

601
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:07,941
I can't believe I'm still hounding you
for basic communication.

602
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:09,025
Yeah. Well, I can't believe

603
00:44:09,045 --> 00:44:10,360
- I'm standing here--
- Oh, shut up.

604
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,654
Do you think I've nothing better
to be doing than hunting you down

605
00:44:12,674 --> 00:44:14,567
and begging you to do the right thing?

606
00:44:15,009 --> 00:44:16,074
Sign the papers.

607
00:44:16,094 --> 00:44:18,571
Are you hearing me? Let us go.

608
00:44:28,189 --> 00:44:30,291
And that's my fecking car, by the way.

609
00:44:31,818 --> 00:44:33,336
Are you okay?

610
00:44:33,903 --> 00:44:34,968
What do you need?

611
00:44:34,988 --> 00:44:37,215
We just got the toxicology results.

612
00:44:39,033 --> 00:44:40,551
Should I call the Garveys?

613
00:44:42,245 --> 00:44:44,561
No, we'll go see them.

614
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,307
They've had their grace period.

615
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,434
Literally.

616
00:44:53,047 --> 00:44:54,732
Sorry for barging in on you.

617
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,987
We have the toxicology results
for Mrs. Reilly.

618
00:45:07,353 --> 00:45:09,122
- Detective.
- Oh, yes.

619
00:45:10,023 --> 00:45:12,922
So she was tested for alcohol,

620
00:45:12,942 --> 00:45:17,630
narcotics, anti-inflammatories,
antihistamines, everything, basically.

621
00:45:21,075 --> 00:45:22,260
And it's clean.

622
00:45:24,996 --> 00:45:26,347
Not even half a shandy.

623
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:30,315
- Nothing?
- Clear as water.

624
00:45:30,335 --> 00:45:31,602
Nothing at all?

625
00:45:41,179 --> 00:45:42,530
Urs?

626
00:45:44,057 --> 00:45:46,034
Urs, come here, honey.

627
00:45:46,601 --> 00:45:48,036
It's an emotional business.

628
00:45:54,692 --> 00:45:58,129
Can I just ask Becka, isn't it?

629
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:00,256
Yeah.

630
00:46:01,074 --> 00:46:03,801
Is it true that you were involved
with Matt Claffin?

631
00:46:05,703 --> 00:46:06,601
What?

632
00:46:06,621 --> 00:46:08,061
Well, we were just trying to work out

633
00:46:08,081 --> 00:46:11,731
why Grace would have retracted her claim
with Claffin Insurance, citing suicide

634
00:46:11,751 --> 00:46:14,103
when clearly there was no suicide.

635
00:46:15,046 --> 00:46:19,239
I was not involved
with Matt Claffin.

636
00:46:19,259 --> 00:46:23,034
Apparently you were doing
a lot of likes on his "YouTubes."

637
00:46:23,054 --> 00:46:24,155
Huh?

638
00:46:24,556 --> 00:46:26,079
Were you a fan of his music, then?

639
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:27,413
Hardly.

640
00:46:27,433 --> 00:46:28,951
Must have got that wrong.

641
00:46:30,353 --> 00:46:34,420
Well, so many unanswered questions:
Where was Grace going?

642
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,297
Was she running from something?

643
00:46:36,317 --> 00:46:39,462
Was it because we were
looking into JP's death as murder?

644
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:44,634
Well, don't you worry.
We will get to the bottom of it all.

645
00:46:49,747 --> 00:46:50,937
See you soon.

646
00:46:50,957 --> 00:46:52,225
Wait.

647
00:46:55,587 --> 00:46:56,609
Thanks for letting us know.

648
00:46:56,629 --> 00:46:59,487
Did Matt fucking talk to them?
Why would he do that to us?

649
00:46:59,507 --> 00:47:02,282
They saw him at the funeral, Becka.
They were bound to start digging.

650
00:47:02,302 --> 00:47:03,700
Stop shouting at me.

651
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,577
Literally not shouting.

652
00:47:05,597 --> 00:47:07,949
Urs, love. What?

653
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,702
I thought it was all my fault.

654
00:47:11,436 --> 00:47:13,329
Oh, God.

655
00:47:16,274 --> 00:47:17,959
I was taking pills…

656
00:47:19,235 --> 00:47:20,466
and I gave some to Grace,

657
00:47:20,486 --> 00:47:23,344
and I couldn't remember
if I told her not to drink on them.

658
00:47:23,364 --> 00:47:25,471
You've been carrying
this around the whole time?

659
00:47:25,491 --> 00:47:26,843
Poor thing, Urs.

660
00:47:27,869 --> 00:47:30,680
Why would you think giving her drugs
was a good idea?

661
00:47:31,664 --> 00:47:33,646
Sorry, you know how vulnerable she was.

662
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:35,440
Oh, come off the cross.

663
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,526
The amount of triple-- quadruple whiskeys
you've poured down me

664
00:47:38,546 --> 00:47:40,320
when I've had so much as an inconvenience.

665
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,114
Yeah, fair point. Sorry.

666
00:47:43,134 --> 00:47:48,698
There's more.
I told Angelica about the pills.

667
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,789
You told that Christian weirdo and not us.

668
00:47:51,809 --> 00:47:53,082
Why would you do that?

669
00:47:53,102 --> 00:47:55,793
She jumped on what I told her.
She used it against me.

670
00:47:55,813 --> 00:47:58,046
She got fecking money out of me.

671
00:47:58,066 --> 00:47:58,963
What?

672
00:47:58,983 --> 00:48:00,840
I think she did the same to Grace.

673
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,218
I mean, blackmailing her
with what she knew about JP.

674
00:48:03,238 --> 00:48:05,798
- I mean, why else would--
- Angelica knows about JP?

675
00:48:06,366 --> 00:48:07,759
I think Grace must have told her.

676
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:11,392
Just go steady, okay.
We don't know anything yet.

677
00:48:11,412 --> 00:48:13,478
We need to get the cops
looking at the right person.

678
00:48:13,498 --> 00:48:15,230
We are the right person.

679
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,857
In case you didn't notice,
they were here looking at us.

680
00:48:17,877 --> 00:48:18,942
That bloody wagon.

681
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,104
She's a parasite.

682
00:48:20,505 --> 00:48:23,238
She'll be searching
for the next person she can leech onto.

683
00:48:23,258 --> 00:48:25,318
So, let's get one step ahead of her.

684
00:48:50,535 --> 00:48:51,970
There she is.
