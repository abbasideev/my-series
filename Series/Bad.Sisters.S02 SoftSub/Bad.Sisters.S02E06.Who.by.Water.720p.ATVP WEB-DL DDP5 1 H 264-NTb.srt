1
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,415
What happened?

2
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,169
What happened?

3
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,956
This is really bad. I mean, terrible.

4
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,078
- I'm gonna be sick.
- This is bad.

5
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,377
- It's the Irish Sea!
- How could you...

6
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,256
- I just don't understand.
- Really bad!

7
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,258
I mean, this is terrible.

8
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:12,928
- It's terrible. Jesus Christ. It's bad.
- It's an absolute nightmare.

9
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,054
- Bad, bad. Bad.
- This is bad.

10
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,806
- Oh, my God.
- This is bad, bad, bad.

11
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,558
Becka, I cannot think with you doing that.

12
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,017
Could you not just have--

13
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,729
- Just have what, Eva?
- Have just fucking saved her!

14
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,398
- The radio wasn't working.
- We tried everything.

15
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,359
- We didn't know what to do.
- Can we please drop it down a decibel?

16
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:28,360
Blanaid's upstairs.

17
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,279
I'll call the coast guard, okay?

18
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,699
We're gonna call a coast guard.
What... Is it 999?

19
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,903
Eva, don't.

20
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:36,952
There'll be police.

21
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,824
It was an accident.

22
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,498
We'd no reason to want her dead.

23
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,911
Yeah.

24
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,582
Oh, shit.

25
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,210
What?

26
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:55,637
I told Loftus
that Angelica was blackmailing Grace.

27
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,889
- What?
- You told Loftus?

28
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,766
- Why were you even talking to the cops?
- Oh, my God! Eva!

29
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,435
Because Blanaid was missing.

30
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:05,314
You have just given us a motive
for murdering the woman!

31
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:08,149
I didn't know you were gonna
take her out and bloody drown her, did I?

32
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,903
Don't you put this on me, okay?

33
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,821
Jesus Christ, you had one job.

34
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,651
- Eva. Calm down. It's okay.
- You--

35
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,618
Well, what does it mean?

36
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,578
We go to the cops now, what does it mean?

37
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,331
Like we...
We tell them it was an accident. We--

38
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,250
Manslaughter,
you're looking at seven to ten.

39
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,793
But...

40
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,337
I mean, you had a motive, so...

41
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,666
Oh, come on.

42
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,632
I need a drink.

43
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,421
- What, years?
- You can't drink. You're pregnant.

44
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,928
She's pregnant.

45
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,096
Well, I'm definitely not having the baby
if I'm going to jail.

46
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,264
Are you talking years?

47
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,136
Well, he's not talking about weeks, is he?

48
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,930
I mean, a woman is dead.

49
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,110
Who knows you took her on the boat?
Does Roger?

50
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,732
No, she knew he'd want to come.

51
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,484
Right.

52
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,739
Look, I'll go down to the marina,
have a look around,

53
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:05,035
see if there are any cameras, you know?
Anything to connect you to the boat.

54
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:09,623
I'll call you
when I've sussed things out. Okay?

55
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,510
We didn't kill her.

56
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,553
Well, you didn't not kill her.

57
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,895
Oh, fuck.

58
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:08,659
What?

59
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,063
Why isn't he calling?

60
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,072
- What are you doing?
- I'm reading about tides.

61
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,532
How do they work?

62
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,908
It's gravitational.

63
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,661
It's... You have the moon and it's...

64
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,867
- I don't know!
- Do you think I should call him?

65
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,203
Are you okay?

66
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,961
She's pregnant. She was in freezing water.

67
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,457
I was worried about her.

68
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,002
Oh, shit. It's Ian.

69
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,463
Hey, what's happening?

70
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,258
There's blood on the boat.

71
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,475
There's blood on the boat.

72
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,978
- Oh, my God. Well, that's just great.
- God, no.

73
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,392
- Put it on speaker.
- Hang on.

74
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,941
We'll go down there now.

75
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,818
We'll clean it up.

76
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,524
No, because we have another problem.

77
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,699
There's a security camera
on a house overlooking the harbor

78
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,112
<i>looking directly at the boat.</i>

79
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,156
Oh, Christ.

80
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,622
<i>I'll have to think of
a way of getting at it.</i>

81
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,832
<i>I'll call you when I've figured that out.</i>

82
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:37,628
Wait.
I think we need to talk to the police.

83
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,750
<i>That would be a bad idea.</i>

84
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,794
<i>That will not go well.</i>

85
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,797
<i>Look, I think
you'll have to trust me on that, love.</i>

86
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:48,592
Eva.

87
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:51,845
Okay.

88
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,061
<i>Okay.</i>

89
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,354
This is bad.

90
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:58,310
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

91
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,275
Is Angelica Collins there?

92
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,658
I'm sorry. No, she's not in.

93
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,910
Well, do you have any idea
when she'll be back?

94
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,032
She didn't come home last night.

95
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,077
Oh, right. Okay. Is that usual for her?

96
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,042
She might have taken a notion

97
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,503
to go up north for a few days, you know.

98
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,125
As the Holy Spirit guides her,
she likes to say.

99
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,884
Well, would she usually just
take off like that without telling you?

100
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,130
Holy Spirit allowing.

101
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,805
No, she'd probably ask me
to feed the rabbits.

102
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,426
Oh, rabbits. Nice.

103
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,100
I always wanted a rabbit,

104
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,056
but my mummy said that
they live too long and shit too much.

105
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,647
So, sorry, what's this about?

106
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,940
Why would you need to talk to her?

107
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,271
Well, I'd prefer to
speak with your sister.

108
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:47,114
Is this about this run-in
she had with Ian Reilly?

109
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,860
Threatening her the other night.

110
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,264
- You're not Jehovah, are you?
- F--

111
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,761
No, I'm not.

112
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,724
My bicycle was stolen.

113
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,106
It was chained up just over there.

114
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,150
I was wondering, does that camera work?

115
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,235
Of course it works.
But I'm not letting you in.

116
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,945
- Okay.
- You could be one of them serial killers.

117
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,192
- Do I look like a serial killer?
- Well then, you never know.

118
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,778
I mean, a lot of those fellas
are very good-looking.

119
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,322
Not a serial killer.

120
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,370
Would you know anything about radiators?

121
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:51,590
Okay, it's safe to go.

122
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,021
We're just cleaning a boat,
people do it every day.

123
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,482
Let's just get it over with.

124
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,367
There you go.

125
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,035
You shouldn't have
any more trouble with that.

126
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,495
That's great.

127
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:19,164
Yeah. Can I maybe see the camera now?

128
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,292
- Of course you can. You're very good.
- All right, thank you.

129
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,997
My son had it installed.

130
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:28,465
He worries about me living here
on my own since Elsie died.

131
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,883
Elsie was my sister.

132
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,427
The one I told you had
the devotion to Padre Pio.

133
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,554
Uh-huh.

134
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,098
I showed you the picture of
the two of us in Rome, didn't I?

135
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,302
Yeah.

136
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,017
Lovely shot.

137
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,061
You know,
when we were leaving the basilica,

138
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,016
didn't she fall down the steps?

139
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,190
I can tell you, from that day onwards

140
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,773
she wouldn't get into a car if there was
a medal of Padre Pio on the dashboard.

141
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,240
Any sign of them there
that took your bike, is there?

142
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,660
No, unfortunately.

143
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,038
I guess we'll never know what happened.

144
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:10,299
You know, in olden times, when they wanted
to find out if a woman was a witch,

145
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,842
they tied her up and threw her in the sea.

146
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,719
Jesus, Bibi, do you have to be so bloody--

147
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:17,092
- Macabre?
- Macabre. That's exactly the word.

148
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,266
We're scrubbing away
the remains of a woman.

149
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,762
What's not macabre about that?

150
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,393
I think there's something going on
between Eva and Ian.

151
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,188
What? Why would you say that?

152
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,065
Did you not see them before?

153
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:35,569
The way he spoke to her, the way
he touched her arm.

154
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,827
I noticed it at her birthday too.

155
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:39,995
Bullshit.

156
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,325
I know what I saw.

157
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,369
- Whose phone is that?
- Can you hear that?

158
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,581
Where...

159
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,543
Where is it?

160
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,092
Oh, my God. It's Angelica's.

161
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,600
It's Roger.

162
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,608
I don't know if it's the nerves
or the pregnancy,

163
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,355
but my tonsils are floating.

164
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,447
Becka, wipe the bowl after you.
We don't want your DNA down there.

165
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,652
Poor Roger.

166
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,244
He must be going out of his mind.

167
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,115
Should I answer?

168
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,454
What did you do that for?

169
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,002
I panicked.

170
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,582
Urs!

171
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,506
I'm bleeding.

172
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,627
Go.

173
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,884
Go. I've got this.

174
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,052
- Come on.
- It's all right.

175
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,637
We'll go to the hospital
and get it checked out.

176
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:39,925
Okay.

177
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:37,279
Sir, Angelica Collins didn't
come home last night.

178
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:40,611
I'm going to the crash site to check
something, all right? Call me back.

179
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,992
<i>DI Loftus, leave a message.</i>

180
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,163
Grace was driving away from
Angelica Collins's when she crashed.

181
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,712
I think Eva Garvey was telling the truth.

182
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,919
Angelica was blackmailing her
because she found out about JP.

183
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,589
And I just found out that
Ian Reilly was threatening her.

184
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,721
Sir, it's all connected.

185
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,259
It's all...

186
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:47,928
Will you just call me back?

187
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,941
Where's the ultrasound scan... The...

188
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,025
Down there.

189
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,230
Oh, shit.

190
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:01,817
Calm down. This is probably nothing.

191
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,158
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

192
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:05,904
What's he doing? What are you doing?

193
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:08,907
I'm just trying to locate the...

194
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:10,534
Locate it?

195
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,499
Have I lost it?

196
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,164
It's okay.
It's not always easy to see this early on.

197
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,127
I'm just gonna get the...

198
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,760
She should be in the...

199
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,022
Oh, my God. He's terrible at his job.

200
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,357
- Have I had a miscarriage?
- No. It's...

201
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:42,404
It's probably just hormonal, you know,
with all the stress from everything.

202
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:45,616
I should never have let you on that boat.
I don't know what I was thinking.

203
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:48,160
I didn't want the baby anyway,
so it's no wonder my body's--

204
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,657
Becka! Stop that.

205
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:54,244
Hello. Becka, is it?

206
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,251
Yeah.

207
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,166
All right. Let's see what we've got here.

208
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,468
Is it gone? Just tell me.

209
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,423
Let's have a little look, shall we?

210
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:22,481
There you are.

211
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,233
Hiding on us, were you?

212
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,658
It all looks fine.

213
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:28,946
Yeah.

214
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,951
- Should we take some pictures?
- Yeah.

215
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:00,852
Mr. Reilly.

216
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,608
Sorry, I can't resist a tortoise.

217
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,574
Each to their own.

218
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:11,451
Well, they always remind me of
my bio dad, as it goes.

219
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,579
Bald, angry, sex mad.

220
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:15,122
What can I do for you, Detective?

221
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:18,083
Sorry. Yeah, I was gonna call, but I don't
have a number for you, it seems.

222
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,372
Just wanted to have a quick word
about Angelica Collins.

223
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:23,292
What about her?

224
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,925
You did a bit of a job on her,
apparently, according to her brother.

225
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,630
I don't know about that.

226
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:32,222
She was bothering
the Garvey sisters, they're my family.

227
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,850
I asked her to stop. That was all.

228
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,723
Problem is, all I see is
a man threatening a woman.

229
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:42,483
And that friend, Cathal Leary,
that you claimed you were staying with

230
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,818
- the night Grace died--
- What do you mean claimed?

231
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,570
Well, I mean, we haven't
been able to contact him.

232
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,654
Maybe he's away.

233
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,694
I did mention that
he services nautical cranes.

234
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,327
Look, he has a work mobile.

235
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,037
I'm sure I've got
a business card somewhere.

236
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,788
I can drop it into the station, okay?

237
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,702
Yeah, why don't you do that?
Drop it into me.

238
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,079
Or I could just grab your number now.

239
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,541
In case I need to get a hold of you
sooner rather than later.

240
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,809
Gotcha.

241
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,715
- You go in and lie down.
- Yeah.

242
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,504
I'll bring you a cup of tea.

243
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,595
- Do you want something to eat?
- No.

244
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:56,056
Just a biscuit maybe, or a piece of bread.

245
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,349
Yeah.

246
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:00,889
A sandwich? Or pasta? Whatever's easy.

247
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,225
Eva.

248
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,228
Hey.

249
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,857
No need to look so delighted to see me.

250
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:12,734
Sorry.

251
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,028
I got you some dinner.

252
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,077
Yeah, that's very sweet, but--

253
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,865
The cops paid me a visit.

254
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,883
I'm sorry. I don't even...

255
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:32,509
Jesus. This is not good.

256
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,802
- Yeah.
- This is not good.

257
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,889
I'm so fucking scared for everyone.

258
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:38,849
And, Blanaid,

259
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:41,810
I'm supposed to be protecting her,
the poor little thing, and now--

260
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,099
Eva, this is not all on you.

261
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,018
I'm not going anywhere.

262
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,437
Now, I want to help protect her too.

263
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:54,281
I spent the morning listening to the news
every hour on the hour, I think.

264
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,200
And the longer it goes
without us hearing anything,

265
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,077
the less likely it is
for Angelica to wash up.

266
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,537
What a disgusting human.

267
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:05,125
Well, I spent the morning
bleeding an old woman's radiators

268
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,581
to get to her CCTV footage.

269
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,376
Well, that just all sounds like
a euphemism for something else.

270
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,426
What's wrong with you?

271
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,851
I mean, why are you sticking around?

272
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,103
Most men would have
run a mile from this mess.

273
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,893
'Cause I care about you. About all of you.

274
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,521
Now, in fairness, mainly you.

275
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,407
Sorry.

276
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,372
- Well, can we talk about what happened?
- Oh, God.

277
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,004
It's almost laughable.

278
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,756
I get off with my brother-in-law

279
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:56,468
and it's not even the most fucked up thing
that's happened in the past 24 hours.

280
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:59,883
I'm not really
your brother-in-law if that helps.

281
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,678
It's not just the...

282
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,519
Even if she...

283
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,641
Look, it's just very bad timing.

284
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,812
Because the thing about feelings is
they have to be timed right.

285
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:18,777
I think what I'm trying to say is,

286
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:23,704
you've been in a relationship with
your couch and your remote control

287
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,117
for a while now,

288
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,036
and I think it's time to move on.

289
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:32,207
What?

290
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:46,643
- Roger. Hi.
- Sorry to bother you, Eva.

291
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,640
You haven't seen Angelica, have you?

292
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:51,815
No. I haven't.

293
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:55,027
It's just, she's not responding to
her texts and that's not like her.

294
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:56,189
She loves a text.

295
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:58,864
No.

296
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:01,158
And I've had a detective at my door
looking for her as well.

297
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:02,362
What's going on?

298
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:06,950
My sister disappeared.

299
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,958
I was hoping maybe that
Blanaid might know something.

300
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,336
Bla, she's not here. She's with Molly.

301
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,379
I think Blanaid has
been through enough trauma

302
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,960
without stories of people going missing.

303
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:19,338
It's not a story.

304
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:20,969
You threatened her.

305
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,514
- I told the Guards about it.
- No, he didn't threaten her.

306
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:24,598
It was a misunderstanding.

307
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:27,137
Yeah, I told her
to stop harassing my family.

308
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:31,141
And you could do with
heeding the same advice.

309
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:37,481
Roger.

310
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,236
Did you have to be so hard on him?

311
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:46,573
I know what it's like to lose a sister
and not get to say goodbye.

312
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,535
Sorry, I didn't think. I...

313
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,916
I should go.

314
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:59,299
Yeah.

315
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,504
I'll see ya.

316
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:02,756
See ya.

317
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,861
Oh, sir.

318
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:26,743
I've been ringing you all day.

319
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,782
Did you get my voice messages?

320
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:30,659
Yep.

321
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:35,210
Okay, so, like I said, I think
that Ian Reilly went after Angelica

322
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,879
to get that money back for the sisters,

323
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:39,423
and I think that he could've done
something to her, either out of anger--

324
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:41,633
Those true crime podcasts
are rotting your brain.

325
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,505
No. There is something about him.

326
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:46,638
He's all smiles and charm
and soft, cuddly jumpers, but then--

327
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:48,473
Just shut up, all right?

328
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,929
Grace Reilly was on the run.
It's as simple as that.

329
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:54,062
No. What happened to all the money?

330
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,606
Where is it? Where is Angelica Collins?

331
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:57,357
Angelica Collins has been gone
for a few hours

332
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,271
and you already have her
in a shallow grave.

333
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,316
Have you even put out a general alert
for her vehicle?

334
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,740
- Well, no. But I was--
- Well...

335
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,450
No, maybe you should try that.

336
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,989
A bit of good, old-fashioned police work.

337
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,366
If that's not too much to ask.

338
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:11,987
Any room in there?

339
00:25:14,223 --> 00:25:16,575
Yeah, if you like your sheets moist.

340
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:24,958
Gross.

341
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:28,634
- You'll be 50 one day. I can't wait.
- Yeah.

342
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:30,511
You'll be knocking on 70.

343
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:32,716
Yeah. I can't wait for that either.

344
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:50,734
You know you're gonna
have to tell Joe now.

345
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:55,781
I suppose it's only fair.

346
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:00,374
He'll be raising the child
while I'm in jail.

347
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,454
You're not gonna be in jail.

348
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,963
The sound of the boom hitting her.
I can't stop hearing it.

349
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:20,472
She didn't deserve to die like that.

350
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,017
I know she didn't.

351
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,725
Oh, shit the bed, no.

352
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:54,608
Hang on.

353
00:27:55,217 --> 00:27:56,276
It's bloody...

354
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:00,906
ten past 7:00 in the bloody...

355
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:08,210
Hang on!

356
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,665
Jesus.

357
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:18,674
- Jesus Christ.
- We've got a problem.

358
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:20,634
What?

359
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:23,804
They were in Angelica's handbag.

360
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:25,555
So what?

361
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,103
Is he ever not here?

362
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:32,854
Hey.

363
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:35,023
Blanaid left her kit behind.

364
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:38,657
What's happened?

365
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:40,487
Bibi found Angelica's car keys.

366
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:42,322
Has she a car?

367
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:45,659
I only ever saw her on her bike
and her broom.

368
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:48,292
Well, if she drove to the marina
and parked there,

369
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:52,087
the cops are gonna know she got on a boat.
Then they're gonna start asking around.

370
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:54,840
Well, how do we find her car
if we don't know what she drives?

371
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,129
Go to the marina
and walk around pressing the key fob.

372
00:28:58,363 --> 00:28:59,386
I'll do it.

373
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:01,425
Yeah, well, if you're gonna go,
you need to go now.

374
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:02,890
Sorry, it's...

375
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,933
Look, it's just, they're gonna
move fast on this

376
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,972
if Roger's reported her missing,
all right?

377
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,190
Don't leave any fingerprints.

378
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,729
Yeah, thanks for that, CSI Portmarnock.

379
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:20,736
<i>DI Loftus, leave a message.</i>

380
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:23,780
Houlihan.

381
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:27,993
That vehicle you were looking for,
it's been spotted.

382
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:29,625
What? Where?

383
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:31,371
It's in the marina car park.

384
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:45,636
Well, she's not gonna be driving that,
you dope.

385
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:57,212
What the hell are you doing in my car?

386
00:30:57,232 --> 00:31:00,591
Oh, shit. Sorry. I thought it was mine.

387
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:03,046
- Fuck's sake.
- They're very similar.

388
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:17,644
Oh, God.

389
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,300
Shit. This is bad.

390
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,427
Well, at least she didn't see you, right?

391
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:47,262
- I don't know.
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.

392
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:48,467
Hey.

393
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:53,185
Are you okay? It seemed kinda hairy.

394
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:58,268
I don't know. I don't think she saw me,
but I legged it, so who knows?

395
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:02,898
Why the hell did we meet here?

396
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:06,323
Well, I thought it'd be better
to carry on as normal.

397
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:07,653
You know, be visible.

398
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:10,447
Well, look, we're here now,
shall we go for a swim?

399
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:11,995
Shock the nerves out of us.

400
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:14,581
I don't know. It doesn't feel right.

401
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,124
This was your idea.

402
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:19,122
Yeah, but I can't stop
thinking about, you know,

403
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:22,756
- floating around out there.
- Look, can we just not talk about it?

404
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:24,836
- Please, just for one hour.
- Fine.

405
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,175
So what do you wanna talk about, Eva?

406
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:31,843
What?

407
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:35,764
Have you any news?
Anything you wanna share with the group?

408
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:38,141
Why are you being weird?

409
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:40,143
Fine, I'll just ask you then.

410
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:42,442
What's the story with you and Ian?

411
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:45,529
- There's no stor... What?
- I know something happened.

412
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:47,359
Nothing's happened.

413
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:53,996
Okay, look, weirdly,
and I know it's fucking weird...

414
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,373
I have feelings for hi...

415
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:58,041
- We have for each other--
- What did I tell you?

416
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:00,669
- What?
- Are you joking?

417
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:03,380
Bloody Angelica called it on the boat,
and I stuck up for you.

418
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,751
Yeah, I should hope so.

419
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:07,676
Look, Bibi, there is nothing, okay?

420
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:10,637
- I'm only saying it because--
- Because nothing actually happened, Eva?

421
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:12,801
No, I'm...

422
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:18,812
Look, it's confusing, okay?
Because I like him, and--

423
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:21,435
You like him? What are you, 12?

424
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:23,692
I know you haven't had the ride
in two years, but--

425
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,986
- For God's sake, Bibi.
- No. Are you kidding me?

426
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:30,027
Grace is barely cold in the ground and
she's already trying to jump his bones!

427
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:33,577
How can you talk to me like that?

428
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:35,157
Easily.

429
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:38,081
Whatever feelings you two are having,

430
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:40,704
you better bury them
just like you did your sister.

431
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:22,417
Angelica Collins's van's abandoned, sir.
She's nowhere to be seen.

432
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:25,003
This is it. We can finally get Howlett
those heads on sticks.

433
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:26,255
The wrong bloody heads.

434
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:28,840
Sir, I understand
why you're hiding in a pub.

435
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,176
You're thinking,
"I'm not going out on a high,

436
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:33,762
Howlett thinks I'm a waste of space,
I failed."

437
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:36,723
But I think there is something bigger
going on here.

438
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:39,685
And all this points towards a cover-up
in John Paul Williams's death.

439
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:41,478
Jesus. God.

440
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:43,016
A woman died!

441
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,643
And now a woman is missing.

442
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:51,280
Wherever Ian Reilly is,
those Garvey sisters aren't far behind.

443
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,240
I think we should arrest him
before he runs.

444
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,327
No, we are absolutely not doing that.
And you know we can't do that.

445
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:59,705
Well, then, at the very least,
we go to his house,

446
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:02,166
- and we search for the money.
- So this time he took the money?

447
00:35:02,186 --> 00:35:04,168
Last time he was still looking
for the bloody money.

448
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:07,791
- I'm just saying that if we find it--
- The money has been found, okay?

449
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:10,377
What?

450
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:12,921
What do you mean? Where?

451
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,971
In the car, okay?

452
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:19,141
And maybe if you hadn't been chasing your
tail so much, you would have found it.

453
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:21,054
- Well, why didn't you--
- Why didn't I what?

454
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:22,848
What, say something?

455
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,392
You've barely drawn breath.

456
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:29,318
It's like I've said from the start,
the money has got nothing to do with it.

457
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:30,986
Grace Reilly killed her husband

458
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:33,483
and then crashed her car
in the course of doing a runner.

459
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:34,943
The end.

460
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:44,578
Fuck.

461
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:33,835
Oh, Jesus!

462
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:36,672
- Oh, Christ.
- Let me in.

463
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:42,891
- Could you not ring the doorbell...
- Sorry.

464
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:44,680
- ...like normal people?
- Sorry. I'm sorry, I just...

465
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:47,683
I need to know
what's going on with Becka.

466
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:51,024
Well, that's not
for me to tell you, is it?

467
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:53,277
To tell me? So there is something.

468
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:55,904
Well, no,
she's all over the place at the moment.

469
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:57,656
It's probably hormones with the...

470
00:36:57,676 --> 00:36:59,152
The what?

471
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,410
With...

472
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,407
Wait, were you gonna say baby?

473
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:05,742
It's not for me to tell you, Joe.

474
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:09,334
Is it mine or is it his?

475
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:11,211
Who are you talking about?

476
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:12,708
You know who.

477
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:18,380
His music's a crime, by the way.
I've listened to it.

478
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:23,135
Tell her I say congratulations, yeah?

479
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:27,347
You okay, Joe?

480
00:37:37,174 --> 00:37:38,275
What did he say to you?

481
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,867
Nothing. It's...

482
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:43,989
Well, then why are you so...

483
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:49,536
Bibi said some horrible things
to me, even by her standards.

484
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:52,914
She thinks
we're having an affair or something.

485
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:57,711
Christ. Sorry.

486
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:00,672
What did you say to her?

487
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:04,426
I said...

488
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:09,598
- I said I had feelings for you, but if...
- You have feelings for me?

489
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:14,853
Do you?

490
00:38:27,307 --> 00:38:28,408
Hey.

491
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:56,650
It's really good there.
Do you want anything?

492
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,110
- No, I'm all right. Thanks.
- No?

493
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,731
He's not even on LinkedIn.

494
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:01,483
What?

495
00:39:02,134 --> 00:39:03,860
Ian. He's...

496
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,201
It... Doesn't that strike you as weird?

497
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:08,782
I'm not on LinkedIn.
You're not on LinkedIn.

498
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:13,412
- Can I watch some TV?
- Yeah, of course.

499
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:21,967
What's going on?

500
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:23,510
Are you having second thoughts again?

501
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,596
Why would you think that?

502
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:27,217
Because of the way you've been acting.

503
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:29,975
Last night
you were whimpering in your sleep.

504
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:32,306
The night before that,
you didn't even come home.

505
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:36,356
I only agreed to go back to the clinic
because you said you were sure this time.

506
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:37,941
It has nothing to do with the baby.

507
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:42,232
Yeah, well, whatever it is,
it's giving you nightmares.

508
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:45,694
Have a think about whether
you want to keep the appointment tomorrow.

509
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:25,233
Eva?

510
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:29,947
Yeah, sorry. I'm just... I'm in here.

511
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:33,241
Yeah, I know.

512
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:38,794
You okay? I loved that.
I'm sorry I fell asleep.

513
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:41,296
Yeah. That's... It's fine.

514
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:45,879
You know, you're clearly tired
and I'm emotional.

515
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,305
So let's just...
let's just leave it at that.

516
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:51,515
I'll see you around.

517
00:40:51,535 --> 00:40:52,599
Fuck.

518
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:55,889
Eva. Can you open the door, please?

519
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:13,323
This is the worst thing I've ever done.

520
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:16,123
And I've done some very bad things.

521
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:17,327
Bullshit.

522
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:21,336
You've spent your life
putting everyone else first.

523
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:22,916
Grace said it all the time.

524
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:26,253
When is it your turn to be happy?

525
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,506
Yeah, but I'm just not prepared
to hurt people for my happiness.

526
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:31,883
Blanaid and my sisters,

527
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:35,434
especially Blanaid. I'd rather die
an old maid. I swear to God.

528
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:38,765
This isn't some grief thing for me, Eva.

529
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:44,187
You know, I'm in this
for you and for Blanaid.

530
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:47,524
Where's the harm in that?

531
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:51,945
And if the worse comes to worse,
then what?

532
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:54,495
What if I go to prison?

533
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:56,830
I'm the one the cops are chasing after.

534
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,077
A woman is dead because of us.

535
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:05,500
So if it does come to that, I need to know
that I've done everything I can for Bla.

536
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:08,003
There's things we can do. We...

537
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,845
We'll sort it out.

538
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,592
Okay. When?

539
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:16,970
We'll go to the bank tomorrow.

540
00:42:17,996 --> 00:42:19,097
We'll make it work.

541
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,689
We will?

542
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:23,977
Whatever you need.

543
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:30,150
Speaking of which,
I'd better get back to her.

544
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:32,319
Will you tell her I love her?

545
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:34,571
- Yeah.
- Okay.

546
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:45,290
Hi, Becka.

547
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:49,753
- I'll talk to you later.
- Yeah, okay.

548
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:59,096
- Please don't--
- You do you, Eva.

549
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:01,974
Why don't you sort your own shit out?

550
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,395
Joe was here earlier.
He knows you're pregnant, by the way.

551
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:42,806
Yep.

552
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:18,425
What are you doing? Get out.

553
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:20,844
Sorry, sir.

554
00:44:31,755 --> 00:44:33,190
Sorry.

555
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:36,693
Sir.

556
00:44:38,387 --> 00:44:42,871
Sir. I checked that car, every inch of it.

557
00:44:42,891 --> 00:44:45,369
- What are you on about?
- You tampered with evidence.

558
00:44:46,603 --> 00:44:48,335
Detective, drop it.

559
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:49,790
I'm gonna report this.

560
00:44:50,482 --> 00:44:51,875
I wouldn't if I was you.

561
00:44:53,485 --> 00:44:55,300
Are you threatening me?

562
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,636
I'm offering you some advice, Detective.

563
00:44:57,656 --> 00:44:59,221
And speak to me like that again,

564
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:01,098
and you'll find yourself
back on the South Circular

565
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:03,470
handing out speeding tickets
for your troubles.

566
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:12,271
Yeah, I like her.

567
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:15,154
You wanna tell Ruben?

568
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:16,358
Yeah.

569
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:25,534
Or maybe we should wait
until after the next appointment.

570
00:45:26,018 --> 00:45:27,494
Bibi, come on.

571
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:31,962
She spits a lot when she talks.

572
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:34,251
Seriously? One hit me right in the cheek.

573
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:36,920
I mean, they need to get glass screens.

574
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:40,632
It's good to see you laugh like that, Eva.

575
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:49,224
What the hell?

576
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,177
Who are you?

577
00:46:27,246 --> 00:46:30,057
Bibi. What's wrong?

578
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:32,684
What's wrong?

579
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:36,235
I did think it was weird

580
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:38,737
that you didn't have anyone there
belonging to you at the wedding.

581
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:40,239
No family, no friends.

582
00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:43,450
Your best man was some random-er
you met a year ago

583
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,743
at some bereavement group.

584
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:47,371
Look, I know you're upset
about what Eva told you.

585
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:50,869
What, about you cracking on
to your dead wife's sister?

586
00:46:53,105 --> 00:46:55,749
You've been under a lot of strain.
We all have.

587
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,296
Why did you tell me to go
and look for the car?

588
00:47:02,406 --> 00:47:04,179
Did you know
that detective would be there?

589
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:05,764
- What?
- Angelica said something

590
00:47:05,784 --> 00:47:08,971
before she went into the water.
She said you weren't to be trusted.

591
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:14,601
She was right, wasn't she?
