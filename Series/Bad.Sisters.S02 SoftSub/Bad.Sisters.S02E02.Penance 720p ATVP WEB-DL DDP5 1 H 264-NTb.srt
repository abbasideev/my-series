1
00:00:14,202 --> 00:00:15,303
Grace.

2
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:19,557
Grace, are you okay, honey?
Has something happened?

3
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,309
Where's Ian?

4
00:00:24,212 --> 00:00:25,521
Grace, are you coming out?

5
00:00:27,173 --> 00:00:27,987
What do I do?

6
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:30,652
Just leave her a bit. Should we call Ian?

7
00:00:31,177 --> 00:00:32,157
I'll call Bibi.

8
00:00:32,177 --> 00:00:33,488
I'll put the kettle on.

9
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:01,302
You're very ripe.

10
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:04,764
Have a wash after your toast.

11
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:31,337
Hey!

12
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:33,793
Will you put mine in the oven?
I'm gonna just go for a run.

13
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:37,343
- What?
- Don't end up in Navan.

14
00:03:37,363 --> 00:03:39,470
Jesus, you do one run to Navan.

15
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,015
Yeah, well, it's hard to
forget an accidental 34 miles, Bibi.

16
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:43,933
I had a lot on my mind that day.

17
00:03:43,953 --> 00:03:46,227
Well, we've to be at the clinic for 12:00.

18
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:48,725
I've booked the day off for it.

19
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:52,437
Don't run away.

20
00:04:05,308 --> 00:04:06,956
- What?
- <i>Could you get over here?</i>

21
00:04:06,976 --> 00:04:08,625
<i>Something's wrong with Grace.</i>

22
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:09,829
<i>Ian's gone.</i>

23
00:04:10,313 --> 00:04:11,497
Grace?

24
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,337
Grace!

25
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,558
- Hey.
- She won't come out.

26
00:04:25,578 --> 00:04:27,185
She can stay in there then.

27
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:28,431
Bla.

28
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,358
Hey, listen,
can you use your phones in school?

29
00:04:33,378 --> 00:04:35,313
We're allowed to check them at lunch.

30
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:39,822
Okay, well, look, I'll just--
I'll text you as soon as Ian's back, okay?

31
00:04:39,842 --> 00:04:41,944
Why were the Guards here yesterday?

32
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:45,245
I didn't know they were, honey.

33
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:48,117
She was hysterical last night,
like, it was insane.

34
00:04:48,643 --> 00:04:50,291
- She's mental.
- Oh, come on, Bla. Don't--

35
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:51,788
What? She is.

36
00:04:54,482 --> 00:04:55,792
Enjoy school.

37
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:02,762
What's going on? I'm missing breakfast.

38
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:04,722
- Nora made shakshuka.
- Yum.

39
00:05:04,742 --> 00:05:06,850
Jesus. I didn't even have time
to brush my teeth.

40
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,018
If you had time to put mascara on,
you had time to brush your teeth.

41
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:10,144
Well, I disagree with that.

42
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:14,732
Listen, come here.
The Guards were here last night.

43
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:16,145
- The Guards? Why?
- Yeah.

44
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:20,196
Hi, hon, you okay?

45
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:21,698
Do you want a cup of tea or--

46
00:05:21,718 --> 00:05:23,449
- Yeah.
- Here. Here. It's hot.

47
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:26,406
Did Bla take her iPad? It was charging.

48
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:28,366
Yeah, she has it.

49
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:32,912
Listen, are you-- What's happened, hon?

50
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:34,998
Where's Ian?

51
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:41,254
We had an argument is all.

52
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:44,429
- He left.
- Why?

53
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:45,638
What were the police doing here?

54
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:48,219
Don't bark at her.
Give her a chance to answer.

55
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:51,519
They found a dead body in a suitcase.

56
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,771
They what the fucking what?

57
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,727
John Paul's father. George.

58
00:05:57,754 --> 00:05:59,397
They said he was murdered.

59
00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:05,116
- Did you not hear what I said?
- Yeah, no, we did. It's--

60
00:06:05,136 --> 00:06:08,411
I'm just computing.

61
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:11,206
- Shit. I can't believe that.
- Oh, my God.

62
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:12,665
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, yeah, that's insane.

63
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:15,502
Well, look-- Well, whatever happens,
whatever that leads to,

64
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:17,587
I mean, it's not gonna--
it's not your problem, is it?

65
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:18,875
It is my problem.

66
00:06:19,317 --> 00:06:22,967
The detective asked me about John Paul's
life insurance claim as they were leaving.

67
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:24,969
As they were leaving, such a cop move.

68
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:26,221
Well, why did he ask you that?

69
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:29,093
Because he was the one who
exhumed John Paul's body.

70
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:33,306
Shit. Fuck.

71
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,480
Wait. What?

72
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,394
Wait, is that why you were
fighting with Ian?

73
00:06:43,883 --> 00:06:45,068
I think...

74
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:47,992
Roger is going to talk to the police.

75
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:49,364
Roger?

76
00:06:50,473 --> 00:06:51,783
Shellfish Roger?

77
00:06:52,517 --> 00:06:55,453
Roger's gonna talk to
the police about what?

78
00:06:57,772 --> 00:07:00,708
<i>You have two new messages.</i>

79
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:03,007
<i>Fergal, it's Nadine.</i>

80
00:07:03,027 --> 00:07:05,718
<i>Don't forget Sean is picking up
Jessie from school today.</i>

81
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:07,345
<i>And can you sign the consent forms?</i>

82
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:09,722
<i>We're supposed to be
on a plane to Sydney in a few weeks</i>

83
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:11,099
<i>and you're cutting it bloody fine.</i>

84
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:13,101
<i>Could you just get it done?</i>

85
00:07:13,121 --> 00:07:15,687
- Oh, shit.
- Ew, Dad, lock the door!

86
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:16,729
It's broke!

87
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:18,731
I had a flannel over me--

88
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:20,316
No, Dad!

89
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:21,901
- <i>Next message.</i>
- Sorry.

90
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:22,986
<i>I forgot to say.</i>

91
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:24,571
<i>Can you just do something for someone else</i>

92
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,484
<i>for once in your fucking life?</i>

93
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:37,829
I don't think they're there.

94
00:07:38,354 --> 00:07:41,379
They teach you those
observational skills at Templemore?

95
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:44,335
Mrs. Claffin and Sons
have clearly packed up.

96
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:51,264
Wonder where that
doofus of a brother went to.

97
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:53,183
Do you want me to look into it?

98
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:55,513
No, don't worry about it. I'll do that.

99
00:07:55,955 --> 00:07:59,142
Geez. Of course
I want you to look into it.

100
00:08:01,336 --> 00:08:02,609
Who picks your wardrobe?

101
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:04,230
Rupert the Bear?

102
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:09,532
No, my mum-- It--
Yeah, I'll just-- I'll rethink it, sir.

103
00:08:09,552 --> 00:08:11,492
Yeah, do. Rethink the whole thing.

104
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:13,494
You've been parachuted in here, yeah?

105
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:15,616
The least you can do is dress for the job.

106
00:08:16,351 --> 00:08:17,952
Yep. Absolutely, sir, on it.

107
00:08:19,145 --> 00:08:21,836
I was looking into the
John Paul Williams inquest file again.

108
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:23,796
There's no way that was suicide.

109
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:24,923
Agreed.

110
00:08:24,943 --> 00:08:28,760
Unless he created some sort of, like,
self-collapsing, like, pulley system.

111
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,346
But I mean, who would
bother killing themselves like that?

112
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:32,597
I thought that we could go and see--

113
00:08:32,617 --> 00:08:34,933
No, we are not digging up
the same body twice, okay?

114
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:36,726
You can forget about that.

115
00:08:36,746 --> 00:08:38,853
- No, I meant--
- Just get in.

116
00:08:38,873 --> 00:08:41,523
Oh, Christ.

117
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:43,770
Sorry, sir.

118
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:47,690
I can't believe Roger helped her.

119
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:51,944
That's a big secret to keep.

120
00:08:53,638 --> 00:08:56,287
I mean, that's a big thing
to keep from us, don't you think?

121
00:08:56,307 --> 00:08:59,082
Why'd he do it? Why take the risk?

122
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:00,416
He'd do anything for her.

123
00:09:00,436 --> 00:09:02,627
Maybe she should just give him a leg-over.

124
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:05,708
- That'll keep him quiet.
- You are such a dick.

125
00:09:07,443 --> 00:09:08,633
It is a good idea though.

126
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:10,510
I don't know if en masse
is the right approach.

127
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,387
He might think we're
trying to intimidate him.

128
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:14,634
We are trying to intimidate him.

129
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:18,142
I'm starving. Do you have any food?

130
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:20,478
Can we just go in, please?
I can't do this all day.

131
00:09:20,498 --> 00:09:21,896
Joe keeps asking where I am.

132
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,518
What's-her-trots might be in there.

133
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:26,359
Still can't believe
the prick chopped up his own da.

134
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:29,320
Yeah, I thought he was
the kinda guy who just froze dads.

135
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,942
That is hardcore though.

136
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,736
These are so stale they're soft.

137
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:37,281
Well, don't eat them if they're soft,
you mank.

138
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:40,201
Geez, you'd swear
you were the one pregnant.

139
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,413
Nora's not pregnant yet.

140
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:46,754
She's on the hormone tablets.

141
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:48,459
Her uterus will be
getting nice and fluffy now.

142
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:50,461
- Disgusting.
- Cute.

143
00:09:51,654 --> 00:09:53,172
Oh, shit, there he is.

144
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:57,348
Roger!

145
00:09:57,368 --> 00:09:59,350
What are you doing? Come back.

146
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,643
Don't follow him. That's weird.

147
00:10:00,663 --> 00:10:02,812
- Do you think he's going to the cops?
- Go after him in the car.

148
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:04,851
You can't tail someone on a bike, can you?

149
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:07,312
Oh, God.

150
00:10:38,993 --> 00:10:41,351
Jesus Christ,
what are you sneaking up on me for?

151
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:44,057
I'm not. This is my local.

152
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:49,025
Whatever Roger's having, four lemonades
and a packet of cheese and onion.

153
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:50,355
Sure.

154
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:51,981
Shall I find us a table?

155
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:56,152
We already have one.

156
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:51,791
<i>You can't go to the Guards, Roger.</i>

157
00:11:52,734 --> 00:11:54,002
Why youse talking to me?

158
00:11:54,444 --> 00:11:55,425
Where's Grace?

159
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:56,801
She's at home.

160
00:11:56,821 --> 00:11:58,178
She's in a state.

161
00:11:58,198 --> 00:11:59,590
Did she know about the...

162
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:02,140
body in the pond?

163
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,886
Of course not.

164
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:09,350
Grace is the best person
any of us will ever know.

165
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:12,603
And John Paul was a monster.

166
00:12:13,838 --> 00:12:15,648
He was a turd of a man.

167
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:20,783
What happened to him--
What Grace had to do--

168
00:12:20,803 --> 00:12:22,739
The world's better off without him.

169
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:24,615
Even the Pope would say that.

170
00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:29,704
But if Grace goes to jail, if you go
to jail who would that help?

171
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,832
Don't throw your life away for him.

172
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,633
But I've done a terrible thing.

173
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:39,636
Roger, we all did.

174
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:42,847
Roger, we are all involved in this.

175
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:44,724
We all tried to kill that fucker.

176
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:47,347
No. We mean--

177
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,480
We're involved because we knew.

178
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,644
You know, we covered it up.

179
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:55,021
Oh, yeah.

180
00:12:55,964 --> 00:12:58,441
- Yeah.
- We're accessories, Roger.

181
00:12:59,217 --> 00:13:00,943
After the fact.

182
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:03,196
Whatever you're feeling,

183
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:08,326
you know, guilt, anger, regret.

184
00:13:08,768 --> 00:13:12,372
You have to be strong now, Roger,
for Grace and Blanaid.

185
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:14,587
We weren't able to help last time.

186
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:17,710
We wanna help now, you and Grace.

187
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:20,468
We can all be quiet together.

188
00:13:20,488 --> 00:13:21,923
Shit!

189
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,592
Fuck! I'm supposed to be at the clinic.

190
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:26,594
Nora's gonna skin me.

191
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,643
Please don't talk to anyone, Roger.

192
00:13:56,941 --> 00:13:58,918
I thought I'd find you here.

193
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:04,257
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Yeah, of course.

194
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:25,820
Father Furey will be in a little later
if you'd like to clear your thoughts.

195
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:29,579
Really, I have to go.

196
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:31,993
I know why you pulled away, Grace.

197
00:14:35,772 --> 00:14:37,373
I know what you did.

198
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:43,588
What I've...

199
00:14:45,657 --> 00:14:47,008
Roger told me.

200
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,095
He told me everything.

201
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:55,224
I know you killed
your first husband, Grace.

202
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:04,989
What did he say to you?

203
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:07,153
I'm not here to chastise.

204
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:10,615
I'm here to understand.

205
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,578
Help to bring you some peace
or some penance maybe.

206
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,041
I'm sorry, I just--

207
00:15:23,528 --> 00:15:25,380
I will call you.

208
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:29,342
Is that okay? And we can talk, I promise.

209
00:15:30,827 --> 00:15:34,389
I know I let things slide before
and I'm sorry.

210
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,224
But I will--

211
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:40,520
I will call you.

212
00:15:43,715 --> 00:15:44,899
I know you will.

213
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:17,557
No.

214
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,184
Now are we all good to go?

215
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:21,566
Work away.

216
00:16:21,586 --> 00:16:24,527
This one here's seen
it all coming up in the flats.

217
00:16:24,547 --> 00:16:26,316
Isn't that right, Houli-hoop?

218
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:28,156
Tough as Chinese.

219
00:16:28,176 --> 00:16:29,115
Sorry?

220
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:32,619
No, the language Chinese.

221
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,037
It's a saying.

222
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:36,164
To learn the Chinese language, it's tough.

223
00:16:36,184 --> 00:16:37,952
It's fine, sir.

224
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:42,337
Given the length of time dead,
he's in good shape.

225
00:16:42,357 --> 00:16:44,792
Hate to see your idea of bad shape.

226
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:49,677
You dug up his son, John Paul Williams,
two years ago.

227
00:16:49,697 --> 00:16:51,215
Your point is?

228
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:55,433
There were traces of his DNA on
a hacksaw they located in the house

229
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:58,181
matches the blade
used on our friend George here.

230
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:02,482
Serrated edge matches the cut marks.

231
00:17:02,502 --> 00:17:04,729
So he chopped up his own da?

232
00:17:05,504 --> 00:17:07,065
Looks like it.

233
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:12,282
So, you gonna dig him up and arrest him?

234
00:17:12,302 --> 00:17:15,364
Ha-ha-fucking-ha-ha.

235
00:17:21,937 --> 00:17:23,837
Is that the end of the road then, sir?

236
00:17:23,857 --> 00:17:25,421
For George, maybe.

237
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:29,379
Oh, no. Sorry.

238
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:33,716
Oh, God. God.
It's all right. No, you go.

239
00:17:34,117 --> 00:17:37,684
I want you to check any untoward action
in Grace Reilly's account for me.

240
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:39,847
And the older Williams's account
as well, yeah?

241
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,522
- God's sake. Fuck's sake.
- Sorry, sir.

242
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:51,484
Fuck.

243
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:55,613
So do you think it could be like a
family silver kind of a thing?

244
00:17:57,473 --> 00:17:59,914
What? Just call my man in the bank, yeah?

245
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:01,666
Tell them Adolf sent you.

246
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:02,834
Adolf?

247
00:18:02,854 --> 00:18:05,587
Yeah, and that's not racist either,
by the way, it's a nickname.

248
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:07,959
It's my golf nickname.

249
00:18:09,277 --> 00:18:11,004
Two shots in a bunker?

250
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:16,264
It's just-- You don't
have to write it down, just drive.

251
00:18:16,284 --> 00:18:17,468
Okay.

252
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:27,437
I couldn't sleep last night. Can you talk?

253
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:29,569
<i>I'm just heading back into work.</i>

254
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:30,570
Is no one else worried?

255
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,574
Hey. About what? Roger?
I think we got through to him.

256
00:18:34,594 --> 00:18:36,993
No, not about Roger, about Grace.

257
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:41,206
About her not telling us she involved an
innocent man in the disposing of a body.

258
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:44,000
- Hey, look.
- Gorgeous.

259
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,127
<i>What do you mean? Bibi?</i>

260
00:18:46,147 --> 00:18:49,834
- Here, take the ball.
- <i>Bibi, what do you mean?</i>

261
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:53,510
I'm starting to have thoughts I
don't wanna have about my own sister.

262
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,131
- <i>Have you spoken to her?</i>
- Hey.

263
00:18:55,573 --> 00:18:57,263
Not this morning, no.

264
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:59,682
<i>Eva called Blanaid
on the way to school earlier.</i>

265
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:00,975
Still no Ian.

266
00:19:00,995 --> 00:19:02,143
<i>What are you saying?</i>

267
00:19:02,163 --> 00:19:05,104
Something's happened to him? An accident?

268
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:06,517
I don't know what to think.

269
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:08,816
Can we meet at Grace's after work?

270
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:11,356
Fine, but you're really stressing me out.

271
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:15,860
Coffee.

272
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,543
How you feeling, love?

273
00:19:33,027 --> 00:19:34,128
Okay.

274
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:36,719
Okay, just another ten minutes.

275
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:39,509
We'll get you sorted, okay? Hang in there.

276
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:08,496
- Hi.
- Hi.

277
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,582
Sorry, sister.

278
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:13,459
Yeah.

279
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:20,717
And this one comes in cupcake?

280
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:22,635
Yeah.

281
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,560
Well, I might wanna mix it up
for my party.

282
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,931
Half-and-half.

283
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,059
It was in your calendar.

284
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:31,728
Cakes.

285
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:35,732
- Could you give us a minute?
- For what?

286
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:39,199
- Is this for your retirement party?
- What do you want?

287
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:41,904
Adolf called. Not Adolf, you're Adolf.

288
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:43,995
Your man at the bank rang.

289
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:47,707
John Paul was siphoning off his
dead dad's pension for nearly ten years.

290
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:49,626
Yeah. Predictable, if nothing else. And?

291
00:20:49,646 --> 00:20:51,122
The Williams' property,

292
00:20:51,898 --> 00:20:55,209
Grace Reilly inherited
all of that after her husband died.

293
00:20:57,028 --> 00:20:59,422
No wonder she walked away
from the insurance claim.

294
00:21:01,115 --> 00:21:03,009
Right. Let's go.

295
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:05,183
Thank you for the spork.

296
00:21:05,203 --> 00:21:07,889
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, sir.

297
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:13,436
- I'm holding the door.
- Sorry.

298
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:25,620
I should've prepped this bed weeks ago.

299
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,617
Don't know what I was thinking.

300
00:21:29,686 --> 00:21:31,543
Have you heard any more from Roger, Grace?

301
00:21:31,563 --> 00:21:34,003
No, and I don't wanna talk about that.

302
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:35,416
Anything from Ian?

303
00:21:41,364 --> 00:21:45,593
Wait, you haven't heard
from Ian in two days?

304
00:21:48,913 --> 00:21:49,894
Sorry I'm late.

305
00:21:49,914 --> 00:21:51,808
There was an outbreak of cholera.

306
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:58,444
Okay. Anyone want tea? I'm gasping.

307
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:00,400
Oh, yeah. Yes, please.

308
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:07,865
Look, I don't want Blanaid hearing us
talking about any of this. Okay?

309
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:10,576
Okay.

310
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,766
Can someone grab me
some toilet paper, please?

311
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:41,149
Toilet paper, please!

312
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:00,793
Don't worry about making tea for me.

313
00:23:01,277 --> 00:23:03,718
I need to get away from her
for my own sanity.

314
00:23:03,738 --> 00:23:05,089
What are you doing?

315
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:08,176
- What?
- Is this blood?

316
00:23:12,997 --> 00:23:14,938
It was in the little cupboard thingy,
in the toilet.

317
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,851
Whose phone is that?

318
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,438
I found it in the bathroom.

319
00:23:21,214 --> 00:23:22,278
I wasn't snooping.

320
00:23:22,298 --> 00:23:24,359
I was just looking
for something to wipe my fanny.

321
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,154
Is that Ian's?

322
00:23:28,638 --> 00:23:30,907
Why hasn't he his phone with him, Grace?

323
00:23:32,267 --> 00:23:34,874
- Is Ian taking me to the match?
- He's not back yet, love.

324
00:23:34,894 --> 00:23:36,621
- Why?
- I don't know, Blanaid.

325
00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:39,462
- Did you frighten him off?
- Don't talk to me like that.

326
00:23:39,482 --> 00:23:40,964
If you hadn't been fighting with my dad,

327
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:42,882
maybe he wouldn't have
gone off angry and got killed.

328
00:23:42,902 --> 00:23:45,802
I wasn't really fighting with your dad.
I just said that 'cause I was upset,

329
00:23:45,822 --> 00:23:47,554
and I was looking for
reasons for what happened.

330
00:23:47,574 --> 00:23:48,721
Maybe the reason is just you.

331
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:49,926
Blanaid!

332
00:23:57,417 --> 00:24:00,149
Of course this is
the age they become monsters.

333
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:01,729
Why are you looking at me?

334
00:24:06,551 --> 00:24:07,860
Blanaid okay, love?

335
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:10,113
What? Yeah.

336
00:24:11,055 --> 00:24:12,782
Do you want me to go with you, Grace?

337
00:24:13,391 --> 00:24:14,539
To take the heat off?

338
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,119
Ruben's got football.

339
00:24:19,272 --> 00:24:20,373
What?

340
00:24:25,778 --> 00:24:27,802
It's fine, they'll be here about George.

341
00:24:27,822 --> 00:24:29,382
Just let them in.

342
00:24:31,534 --> 00:24:32,844
Just get over.

343
00:24:34,412 --> 00:24:35,977
- Hello again.
- Mrs. Reilly,

344
00:24:35,997 --> 00:24:37,854
we'd like to ask you
a few follow-up questions.

345
00:24:37,874 --> 00:24:39,564
- Close it.
- Shouldn't take long.

346
00:24:39,584 --> 00:24:40,481
Come on through.

347
00:24:40,501 --> 00:24:41,894
- Thanking you.
- What?

348
00:24:47,717 --> 00:24:48,781
Sorry to intrude.

349
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:50,111
No problem.

350
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:53,536
Oh, God.

351
00:24:53,556 --> 00:24:55,955
So, what can we do for ya?

352
00:24:55,975 --> 00:24:59,334
Well, as you know, the body of
George Williams has been identified

353
00:24:59,354 --> 00:25:01,294
and this ring was found on his person.

354
00:25:01,314 --> 00:25:02,504
Do you recognize it?

355
00:25:02,524 --> 00:25:06,716
John Paul had a signet ring
with a very similar crest.

356
00:25:06,736 --> 00:25:08,301
It's a family coat of arms.

357
00:25:08,321 --> 00:25:10,053
Yeah. Classy.

358
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:12,472
Are you any closer
to finding out what happened?

359
00:25:12,492 --> 00:25:14,927
Someone chopped up a body
and put it in a suitcase.

360
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:18,806
Sorry, yeah, no, I mean, are you
any closer to finding out who did it?

361
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:21,314
Someone who panicked.

362
00:25:21,334 --> 00:25:24,520
Idiotic to conceal a body
so close to the house.

363
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:29,067
So someone was clearly planning
on returning at some point to retrieve it,

364
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:32,242
but then didn't or couldn't.

365
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:34,280
- Because they were dead.
- Just--

366
00:25:36,683 --> 00:25:38,581
So we'd like to ask you
a few more questions

367
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:40,995
about your husband's accident.

368
00:25:41,396 --> 00:25:43,164
You said he committed suicide.

369
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:49,509
We've looked at the inquest files and
I have to say that seems very unlikely.

370
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:51,177
What makes you think he killed himself?

371
00:25:51,197 --> 00:25:52,840
Whose business is that?

372
00:25:55,618 --> 00:25:57,892
We spoke to your insurers,
Claffin and Sons.

373
00:25:57,912 --> 00:25:59,102
Yeah, unfortunately, they were--

374
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:01,516
And they've confirmed
that you've dropped the claim

375
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:04,524
and, obviously,
that's exactly what they wanted,

376
00:26:04,544 --> 00:26:07,689
- which is very interesting.
- Please.

377
00:26:12,093 --> 00:26:13,194
Hey, love.

378
00:26:13,636 --> 00:26:16,995
The Guards were
just asking some questions.

379
00:26:17,015 --> 00:26:19,038
- Are you off to play a match?
- Uh-huh.

380
00:26:19,058 --> 00:26:21,249
- Yeah? Who you playing?
- Balcarrick.

381
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:25,123
Those Balcarrick girls,
they are built like brick shithouses.

382
00:26:26,065 --> 00:26:27,709
Use plenty of elbow, yeah?

383
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:30,128
I'm gonna wait in the car.

384
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:37,599
I may have to follow up
with this if that's okay.

385
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:39,142
Is Mr. Reilly back later?

386
00:26:39,162 --> 00:26:42,854
No, he's away at a golf tournament.

387
00:26:42,874 --> 00:26:45,231
He's gone golfing without his clubs?

388
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:47,979
No, he's a spectator.

389
00:26:48,546 --> 00:26:50,189
Oh, well, good for him.

390
00:26:51,216 --> 00:26:53,401
- Good evening to you all.
- Good evening.

391
00:26:56,596 --> 00:26:58,239
We'll see ourselves out.

392
00:27:05,772 --> 00:27:07,081
Friendly bunch.

393
00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:10,215
Here-- Are you-- The short one, sir?

394
00:27:10,235 --> 00:27:12,003
Watch your mouth.

395
00:27:17,075 --> 00:27:18,223
Look.

396
00:27:18,243 --> 00:27:20,350
There's a tortoise. There's two of them.

397
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,596
Yeah, I don't care.

398
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,148
For Christ's sake, Grace.

399
00:27:27,168 --> 00:27:28,858
Why did you say JP killed himself?

400
00:27:28,878 --> 00:27:31,361
Well, they asked about the claim.
I panicked. I just panicked.

401
00:27:31,381 --> 00:27:33,530
But why'd you lie to the cops?
I mean, who lies to the cops?

402
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,657
Well, I mean, we do.

403
00:27:35,677 --> 00:27:37,450
We lie to the cops.

404
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,156
I need to go. Come on.

405
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,534
We'll stay.

406
00:27:45,728 --> 00:27:47,580
Yeah, in case Ian comes home.

407
00:27:48,606 --> 00:27:50,421
It's fine, right? Donal's got the kids.

408
00:27:50,441 --> 00:27:53,466
Okay, well, there's some bolognese
in the freezer

409
00:27:53,486 --> 00:27:55,755
if you want to do
some spaghetti with that.

410
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,888
What?

411
00:27:58,908 --> 00:28:00,849
Well, I mean,
you didn't even ask if I had plans or...

412
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:02,016
Do you?

413
00:28:02,036 --> 00:28:03,685
No, don't be a bitch.

414
00:28:03,705 --> 00:28:06,224
I'll go after her. Keep an eye on her.

415
00:28:17,969 --> 00:28:19,904
She's gonna land us all in jail.

416
00:28:22,307 --> 00:28:23,241
Let's go!

417
00:28:26,728 --> 00:28:28,663
- How's it going? How are you?
- How are you, Bibi?

418
00:28:46,915 --> 00:28:48,099
Hey. Sorry.

419
00:29:02,805 --> 00:29:04,657
Why would he leave without his phone?

420
00:29:06,184 --> 00:29:07,165
What the hell is going on?

421
00:29:07,185 --> 00:29:08,625
I mean, do we even know it's Ian's phone?

422
00:29:08,645 --> 00:29:10,001
Well, it's definitely not Grace's.

423
00:29:10,021 --> 00:29:12,212
Blanaid wouldn't be caught dead
with a phone like that.

424
00:29:12,232 --> 00:29:15,340
Did you see the look on her face?
She looked like she was gonna faint.

425
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,462
- Ian's missing.
- He's not missing.

426
00:29:18,196 --> 00:29:19,010
They had a fight.

427
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,257
They had a fight clearly.

428
00:29:28,373 --> 00:29:29,812
What am I looking at?

429
00:29:29,832 --> 00:29:31,517
It's blood.

430
00:29:32,877 --> 00:29:34,108
Are you sure it's not pasta sauce?

431
00:29:34,128 --> 00:29:36,486
I've seen plenty of pasta sauce
and plenty of blood,

432
00:29:36,506 --> 00:29:38,154
and I can tell the difference.

433
00:29:38,174 --> 00:29:41,361
Men like Ian don't just vanish.

434
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:45,161
Am I the one who's gonna have to say it?

435
00:29:45,181 --> 00:29:47,455
- Shut up, Urs.
- Bibi's thinking the same.

436
00:29:47,475 --> 00:29:49,415
- I don't like this.
- It's the Guards this time,

437
00:29:49,435 --> 00:29:51,084
and if they're sniffing around,
which they are

438
00:29:51,104 --> 00:29:53,795
because there's a body
in a bloody suitcase,

439
00:29:53,815 --> 00:29:56,250
then we need to make sure
there's nothing they're gonna find.

440
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:03,638
Look, I know this is mad,
but maybe we just check the house.

441
00:30:03,658 --> 00:30:07,767
Clean up a bit just in case
the police come back, yeah?

442
00:30:07,787 --> 00:30:09,013
Yeah.

443
00:30:19,424 --> 00:30:20,817
Oh, my God.

444
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:24,362
Mind yourselves now.

445
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:26,155
Caroline!

446
00:30:27,015 --> 00:30:28,663
Could you ever bank this for me?

447
00:30:28,683 --> 00:30:31,374
Because Tina Cullen's cancer
has moved to her lymphs

448
00:30:31,394 --> 00:30:33,459
and that pig husband of hers
is nowhere to be seen,

449
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:37,338
so I just thought I'd drop up tomorrow
and see if she fancied a game of poker.

450
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:38,376
Sure.

451
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,176
Yeah. Blanaid.

452
00:30:41,196 --> 00:30:43,047
I have a match about to start.

453
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:44,924
Are you all right, pet?

454
00:30:45,825 --> 00:30:47,765
You look a bit pale. Is your mammy here?

455
00:30:47,785 --> 00:30:49,387
She's by the pitch.

456
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:51,764
Is Ian not waving you on tonight?

457
00:30:52,332 --> 00:30:53,683
Ian's gone.

458
00:31:03,968 --> 00:31:05,862
Come on, girls!

459
00:31:06,304 --> 00:31:08,494
Yes, Blanaid! Go on, Blanaid!

460
00:31:08,514 --> 00:31:09,949
There you are.

461
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:12,910
Ghoul.

462
00:31:15,021 --> 00:31:16,372
She's all right.

463
00:31:16,773 --> 00:31:20,548
She does a lot for the community,
which is more than I can say for some.

464
00:31:20,568 --> 00:31:23,051
Anyone who has to tell you
what a good person they are all the time

465
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:25,506
I fundamentally do not trust.

466
00:31:26,574 --> 00:31:28,009
You look cold.

467
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:29,927
It's bitter out, all right.

468
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,098
Come on, Cailin!

469
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,393
God help us.

470
00:31:37,794 --> 00:31:41,528
- They're tanks those Balcarrick girls.
- Come on, girls!

471
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:44,817
- Your favorite.
- Yes, Blanaid! Lovely!

472
00:31:48,763 --> 00:31:51,282
I think we ought to have that chat, Grace.

473
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:54,499
I know you've been absorbed
with other things,

474
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:59,666
but it's key that we're
on the same page, I think.

475
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:03,920
I don't wanna
talk right now, Angelica. Sorry.

476
00:32:08,157 --> 00:32:12,303
I mean, I do feel
I've been led astray a wee bit.

477
00:32:14,205 --> 00:32:15,270
How do you mean?

478
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:18,476
Well, if you're gonna trust me
with this serious a matter,

479
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:21,354
I need to know everything.

480
00:32:22,297 --> 00:32:26,698
You mustn't protect your sisters
at the expense of yourself and Blanaid.

481
00:32:26,718 --> 00:32:29,200
I'm not. That's not what happened.

482
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,410
But if your sisters are invol--

483
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,120
My sisters are none of your business!

484
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,290
Why are you shouting?
I'm only trying to help you.

485
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,833
You're not helping me.

486
00:32:36,853 --> 00:32:38,668
You are suffocating me.

487
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:41,249
I can't breathe. It's too much.

488
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:44,043
Grace, are you okay?

489
00:32:45,195 --> 00:32:46,754
Grace.

490
00:32:48,323 --> 00:32:51,389
What the hell did you say
to upset her like that?

491
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:53,725
That is hysterical behavior.

492
00:32:53,745 --> 00:32:56,306
And it is going to be
all around the town, you know?

493
00:32:56,831 --> 00:32:58,229
What are you talking about?

494
00:32:58,249 --> 00:33:01,811
And it's not gonna do any of you
any favors at all.

495
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:25,335
Are you okay?

496
00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:29,255
Something's going on with the family.

497
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,300
Bibi's not herself either.

498
00:33:33,701 --> 00:33:37,597
But I'm sure that was, well, not pleasant.

499
00:33:38,498 --> 00:33:39,604
So, I'm sorry.

500
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:42,524
You shouldn't worry about me, my goodness.

501
00:33:42,544 --> 00:33:44,228
You have to be thinking about yourself.

502
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,066
I hear you may have
another wee one on the way.

503
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:55,078
Well, news travels fast,
but not quite yet.

504
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:58,159
Fingers crossed
it's smooth sailing from here.

505
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,875
Well, I'm sure that that UV--

506
00:34:00,895 --> 00:34:06,250
IV-- Egg donor route
is never straightforward.

507
00:34:09,403 --> 00:34:13,465
I know herself was concerned about...

508
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,182
connecting with a baby that wasn't hers.

509
00:34:17,202 --> 00:34:19,180
You know,
having had such trouble with Ruben.

510
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:23,226
Well, she was great with Ruben.

511
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:25,770
Well, not in
the first two years apparently.

512
00:34:27,338 --> 00:34:30,358
Apologies if I misunderstood.

513
00:34:33,635 --> 00:34:36,077
You tell me to just mind my own business,

514
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:39,409
but I often feel that we do things
for those we love

515
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:41,661
at the expense of ourselves,

516
00:34:42,186 --> 00:34:44,372
and it usually ends badly.

517
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:46,833
God bless.

518
00:34:57,202 --> 00:35:00,310
Where the hell is Becka?
Grace is going to be back soon.

519
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,557
She's going through the cupboards
in the bedrooms.

520
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:08,438
Did you know that cop earlier?

521
00:35:10,131 --> 00:35:11,863
'Cause he knew you.

522
00:35:11,883 --> 00:35:13,735
Speed dating event.

523
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,905
- Are you serious?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

524
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,371
- Yeah, but did you--
- No.

525
00:35:20,391 --> 00:35:22,368
- What you didn't even--
- Yeah.

526
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,495
You didn't even--

527
00:35:26,022 --> 00:35:28,416
All of his stuff is still here.

528
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,298
What are we doing?

529
00:35:30,318 --> 00:35:32,050
Seriously, this is ridiculous.

530
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,380
It's ri-- Shit.

531
00:35:38,076 --> 00:35:41,309
- God, you nearly gave me a heart attack.
- The key was in the lock, sorry.

532
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:43,186
Something really weird just happened.

533
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:45,438
Grace lost it with Angelica by the pitch.

534
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:48,066
What? Why? Did Roger talk?

535
00:35:48,086 --> 00:35:49,484
She's right behind me.

536
00:35:49,504 --> 00:35:51,194
I think we need to ask her
what's going on.

537
00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:52,565
You ask her.

538
00:35:55,301 --> 00:35:58,112
Hey! Did you win at the mud wrestling?

539
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,782
I'm gonna have a shower.

540
00:36:01,182 --> 00:36:02,283
Give me that.

541
00:36:03,017 --> 00:36:05,036
- Is there hot water?
- Should be.

542
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:09,374
- Look, you cleaned up. Thanks.
- Yeah, nearly.

543
00:36:12,402 --> 00:36:13,591
I'm sorry about before.

544
00:36:13,611 --> 00:36:15,051
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

545
00:36:15,071 --> 00:36:16,719
Just a bit jumpy is all.

546
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:18,471
Something smells delicious.

547
00:36:18,491 --> 00:36:19,931
It's the bolognese you made.

548
00:36:19,951 --> 00:36:23,137
- Complimenting myself.
- Sit her down.

549
00:36:25,164 --> 00:36:27,266
Grace, will you sit down a minute?

550
00:36:29,168 --> 00:36:30,478
Why?

551
00:36:34,841 --> 00:36:35,905
We're just worried.

552
00:36:35,925 --> 00:36:37,448
Why? I'm fine.

553
00:36:37,468 --> 00:36:40,238
Well, you're not acting fine.

554
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,161
Where's Ian, Gracie?

555
00:36:42,181 --> 00:36:43,955
Is that Ian's phone that Becka found?

556
00:36:43,975 --> 00:36:45,702
Why doesn't he have it with him?

557
00:36:46,102 --> 00:36:48,334
- Why was it hidden?
- Is there something you haven't told us?

558
00:36:48,354 --> 00:36:49,335
What are you saying?

559
00:36:49,355 --> 00:36:51,254
- We're not saying anything--
- We are.

560
00:36:51,274 --> 00:36:54,424
No, we're just-- we just
need to know what's going on.

561
00:36:54,444 --> 00:36:56,843
- We're nervous.
- We're worried is all.

562
00:36:56,863 --> 00:36:59,137
Why did you say that Ian
was golfing to the Guards?

563
00:36:59,157 --> 00:37:01,389
Grace, there's blood on some clothes
in the washing machine.

564
00:37:01,409 --> 00:37:02,807
There's a cut on your hand.

565
00:37:02,827 --> 00:37:05,393
- I smashed a cup.
- Did something happen with Ian?

566
00:37:05,413 --> 00:37:07,020
All his stuff is still here.

567
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,062
I think you should go now.

568
00:37:08,082 --> 00:37:10,148
No, we just need you to listen, okay?

569
00:37:10,168 --> 00:37:12,025
We won't judge you, Gracie. We love you.

570
00:37:12,045 --> 00:37:13,651
But if something happened with Ian...

571
00:37:13,671 --> 00:37:15,987
- I think you should leave. Now, please.
- ...please just tell us.

572
00:37:16,007 --> 00:37:18,943
- Look, will you just listen?
- Just get away from me!

573
00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:45,808
Oh, God.

574
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:46,935
Grace, love,

575
00:37:46,955 --> 00:37:49,098
- I hate seeing you like this--
- Please. Don't.

576
00:37:52,752 --> 00:37:54,020
Oh, my God.

577
00:37:56,631 --> 00:37:58,775
Take them. They'll calm you down.

578
00:37:59,217 --> 00:38:00,943
I'll call you later.

579
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:17,460
Oh, God.

580
00:38:47,181 --> 00:38:50,410
You winded me, you monster.

581
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:55,920
- Where's Mam?
- She's in the sitting room.

582
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,750
She's a bit sad.

583
00:39:02,238 --> 00:39:03,423
Hey.

584
00:39:05,158 --> 00:39:08,344
Go on up to bed, Rubes.
I'll be straight up.

585
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:16,686
Is everything okay?

586
00:39:17,212 --> 00:39:18,771
What's going on?

587
00:39:20,131 --> 00:39:21,029
Nora?

588
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:24,908
It's okay. We're not doing it.

589
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:28,990
No new baby for you
to get all existential about.

590
00:39:29,641 --> 00:39:32,540
- So the pressure's off.
- Has--

591
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,412
Has something happened?

592
00:39:36,981 --> 00:39:41,382
You can't just say we're not doing it.
It's what was my decision too.

593
00:39:41,402 --> 00:39:43,463
Just be honest, Bibi.

594
00:39:44,405 --> 00:39:46,763
I don't even mean with me, for God's sake.

595
00:39:46,783 --> 00:39:48,509
Just be honest with yourself.

596
00:39:49,994 --> 00:39:52,013
I'm telling the clinic
that we're pulling out.

597
00:39:52,622 --> 00:39:55,516
So do you feel better now?

598
00:41:13,077 --> 00:41:16,097
- Are you gonna see the boss?
- Yeah, you're not needed.

599
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:20,231
Dick.

600
00:41:20,251 --> 00:41:21,900
Turns out John Paul Williams's

601
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,485
been siphoning off
his father's pension for years.

602
00:41:24,505 --> 00:41:25,987
That Grace Reilly, his widow,

603
00:41:26,007 --> 00:41:28,823
was the beneficiary
of his entire family's estate.

604
00:41:28,843 --> 00:41:30,361
What's she doing?

605
00:41:34,515 --> 00:41:35,783
Fuck off.

606
00:41:36,476 --> 00:41:38,536
- Thank you, sir. I just wanted to s--
- Quiet.

607
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,747
So what are you saying?

608
00:41:41,147 --> 00:41:44,589
I'm saying I think Grace Reilly
was involved in John Paul's death.

609
00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:48,635
Well, he was clearly a violent man
so she could have retaliated.

610
00:41:48,655 --> 00:41:49,719
What?

611
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:51,137
Those two insurance brothers say

612
00:41:51,157 --> 00:41:54,969
there was foul play in Williams's death
involving the widow

613
00:41:55,703 --> 00:41:57,060
and you said there wasn't.

614
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,479
Yeah, but we may as well
leave all that behind now.

615
00:41:59,499 --> 00:42:00,563
May we as well?

616
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:03,478
We think there's something
much bigger at play here.

617
00:42:04,921 --> 00:42:08,238
We have reason to believe that
the fella she remarried not long after

618
00:42:08,258 --> 00:42:10,073
has now gone walkabout himself, sir.

619
00:42:10,093 --> 00:42:11,486
Black widow?

620
00:42:12,595 --> 00:42:15,537
Nice church-going lady like that?
What does she have to say about it?

621
00:42:15,557 --> 00:42:18,748
Well, when we questioned Grace Reilly
about John Paul Williams's death,

622
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:20,291
she said that he killed himself.

623
00:42:20,311 --> 00:42:22,956
- Is that a possibility?
- No way. She's lying.

624
00:42:24,774 --> 00:42:28,211
Grace Reilly hasn't stopped lying
since our first visit.

625
00:42:29,696 --> 00:42:32,011
Well, fuck it. Get on with it then.

626
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:34,634
Get a warrant, bring her in,
and see what we get.

627
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:38,268
Don't interrupt me like that again.

628
00:42:38,288 --> 00:42:40,186
Sorry, sir, I just thought
you needed a bit of help.

629
00:42:40,206 --> 00:42:41,271
Did you now?

630
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:43,935
Well, I'll be the one
to determine that, Houlihan.

631
00:42:46,296 --> 00:42:47,897
Nice new jacket.

632
00:42:58,349 --> 00:42:59,701
Okay.

633
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:03,705
Come on, Blanaid. You're gonna be late.

634
00:43:13,114 --> 00:43:15,221
There's some toast or some cereal.

635
00:43:15,241 --> 00:43:16,347
I'm not hungry.

636
00:43:16,367 --> 00:43:19,554
Look, I'm wearing the lovely earrings
you got me for the wedding.

637
00:43:21,414 --> 00:43:23,146
I might be home a bit late tonight, Bla,

638
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,356
but I'll leave some money
for some fish and chips

639
00:43:25,376 --> 00:43:27,395
or there's some spag bol leftovers.

640
00:43:29,923 --> 00:43:31,529
I can drop you at the bus on my way to--

641
00:43:31,549 --> 00:43:34,777
- I'd rather walk.
- Fine! Fucking walk then!

642
00:45:21,576 --> 00:45:22,927
I'm sorry.

643
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:25,430
I love you so much.

644
00:46:47,328 --> 00:46:50,640
<i>Hi, Eva Garvey's phone,
please leave a message.</i>

645
00:46:51,165 --> 00:46:52,642
Oh, shit.

646
00:46:53,459 --> 00:46:54,727
Hey, Eva.

647
00:46:55,461 --> 00:46:58,319
Eva, it's me.
I'm-- I really need your help.

648
00:46:58,339 --> 00:46:59,983
I'm so sorry.

649
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:02,110
Please call me back.

650
00:47:05,388 --> 00:47:06,656
Oh, no.

651
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,242
No, where is it? Blanaid.

652
00:47:13,438 --> 00:47:14,539
Oh, f--

653
00:48:11,913 --> 00:48:15,433
- What's happened?
- Miss Garvey? I'm really sorry.

654
00:48:16,876 --> 00:48:19,854
Oh, no. No.

655
00:48:24,884 --> 00:48:25,985
No.
