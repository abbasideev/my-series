1
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:09,818
I have to tell you something,
and I'm a bit scared.

2
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,448
I killed him.

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,538
I killed my husband.

4
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,303
Don't look at me like that.

5
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,804
I think I need to get some air.

6
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,806
No, no. Don't walk away from me.

7
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,350
- You can't walk out on me.
- I can't talk to you like this.

8
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,268
Please. Please don't leave me.

9
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,348
Please.

10
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,256
Grace.

11
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,094
Grace, are you okay, honey?
Has something happened?

12
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,889
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

13
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,976
My sisters are gonna talk to Roger

14
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,519
and I can fix it.

15
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,734
It will be like it was.

16
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,481
<i>No, it can't.</i>

17
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,818
<i>I don't want this now. I don't trust you.</i>

18
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,784
<i>You turned my life upside down.</i>

19
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,031
<i>I have to start over again now.</i>

20
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,535
<i>Grace, look.</i>

21
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:48,005
If I have to carry this,
if you want me to keep your secret,

22
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:53,463
not go to the Guards,
then you need to make it worth my while.

23
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,885
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello.

24
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:45,812
You don't know me,
but I found your number in...

25
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:51,151
a phone that I think
belonged to my husband, Ian Reilly.

26
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,236
<i>Who is this?</i>

27
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,279
<i>And why are you calling on Cormac's phone?</i>

28
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,818
- <i>Colleen, who are you talking to?</i>
- Who's Cormac?

29
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,786
- <i>He's my husband. Who's this?</i>
- <i>Let me deal with this.</i>

30
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,075
- Ian?
- Which one is it this time?

31
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,416
Don't ever ring this number again.
Do you hear me?

32
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,085
Who was that? Where are you?

33
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,379
<i>She said, "My husband."
What does that mean?</i>

34
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:13,465
You demanding answers from me?
In your position?

35
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,672
<i>Just bring the money to the Dundalk bar
and we'll talk then.</i>

36
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,226
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,385
Oh, my God.

38
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,814
It's last orders if
you want something to drink.

39
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,320
You look well.

40
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,373
Are you gonna explain any of this?

41
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,911
No small talk?

42
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:36,840
Okay. What do you
want me to explain exactly?

43
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,712
That you're not who you say you are.

44
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,716
- That you're a liar. A cheat.
- I'm not who I say I am?

45
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,891
Just give me what I asked for, Grace.

46
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,471
You're not getting money from me.

47
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,848
I want what's owed to me.

48
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,564
I want what's mine. I want my house back.

49
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,690
Your house?

50
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,395
Yes, my fucking house.

51
00:04:55,921 --> 00:05:00,233
I want what's in the bank,
I want everything, or I'll go to the cops.

52
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:06,662
Now, your daughter is very fond of me,
as you know, and she's not stupid either.

53
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,743
So she'll listen when
I tell her what her mam did.

54
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:12,960
What's happening?

55
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,545
No one needs to know anything.

56
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:15,749
I'll go away.

57
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:21,463
I'll be just another
husband you carelessly lost.

58
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,634
Did you never love us at all?

59
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,346
You were just a mark, Grace.

60
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,431
Nothing personal.

61
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,068
Stay away from me and Blanaid.

62
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,695
Stay away from my family.

63
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,149
You're getting nothing.

64
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,700
Come on.

65
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,436
<i>Hi, Eva Garvey's phone,
please leave a message.</i>

66
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:13,890
Hey, Eva.

67
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,814
Eva, it's me. I'm...

68
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,437
I really need your help. I'm so sorry.

69
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,814
Please call me back.

70
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,027
Oh, no.

71
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,618
No, where is it?

72
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:28,864
Blanaid.

73
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,617
Oh, f...

74
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,914
Hiya.

75
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,791
Hey.

76
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:04,918
Are you okay?

77
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,212
What do you mean?

78
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,964
Yeah.

79
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,474
{\an8}- Bla, are you having a cup of tea?
- No, thanks.

80
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,353
Hope you didn't mind me letting myself in.

81
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,648
<i>Mi casa tu casa</i> though, right?

82
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,567
What are you doing?

83
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,451
Can I go hang out with Saise?

84
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,036
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Course.

85
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,497
Do you need some squids?

86
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,826
Will you give me a lift?

87
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,494
Do you wanna take the bike, honey?

88
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:41,913
I need to speak to your auntie Eva.

89
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:45,542
Sure.

90
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,587
Bye.

91
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,469
I can tell you're upset.

92
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,769
Look, I'm sorry
I left without saying goodbye,

93
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:01,183
but it just all got too much for me. I...

94
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,020
I regret what happened, Eva.

95
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,064
Which bit?

96
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:11,198
Being a thieving scam artist
or killing my sister?

97
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,159
Well, I don't think
you can pin that one on me.

98
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,364
You targeted her.

99
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,705
You found her at
a bereavement group, you psycho.

100
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,958
You lied to Grace
and now you're lying to me.

101
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,454
I never lied to Grace.

102
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,170
- She knew I had a past.
- You didn't just have a past.

103
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,541
You have another name.

104
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,215
You have another life.

105
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,759
You don't know anything
about my situation.

106
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,799
Just give me Blanaid's
money back and fuck off.

107
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:40,055
I think we need to get
a few things clear, don't you?

108
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,849
Or we're just gonna go round in circles.

109
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,230
Do you want a cup of tea?

110
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:52,109
You know, actually, I'll do a pot.

111
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,988
I assume that was
your sisters you were texting?

112
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,970
{\an8}Jesus.

113
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:46,955
Come in.

114
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,132
Sorry to disturb.

115
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,503
Not as sorry as I am.

116
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,172
Bone broth.

117
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,970
My wife doesn't like me eating red meat,

118
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,176
but she's happy enough to
poison me with this piss.

119
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,094
May I have a word, sir?

120
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:06,188
Grace Garvey's husband's real name
is Cormac Sweeney and he's ex-PSNI.

121
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:10,651
Don't be wasting me time.
That Garvey case closed with Loftus.

122
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,320
He's done it before, sir.
And he's dangerous.

123
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,697
A bloody ex-cop. I want to go after him.

124
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,070
You know what happens to Guards
who turn on their own, don't you?

125
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,824
They find themselves going for
promotions and not getting them.

126
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,702
- But he's...
- Even though you're the best candidate.

127
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,081
And they'll tell you
not to let it put you off applying again

128
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,834
but then a year after that,
same thing would happen.

129
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,420
The year after, same again.

130
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,556
Until the penny finally drops
that the reason you're being passed over

131
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,641
is because there's something you did

132
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,263
when you were too young
to know how it all works.

133
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,601
Now, do you still want to go after him?

134
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,481
I've not got all day.

135
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:42,784
What are you doing?

136
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,869
- Let's go in.
- Just...

137
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,996
Maybe we should call someone first.
In case we need muscle.

138
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,206
What about Joe?

139
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:48,624
Joe's not really muscle material.

140
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:52,294
I mean, he's tall
and he's got big arms, but he's a softy.

141
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,879
- What about Donal?
- No, he's with the kids.

142
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,006
- What about--
- I am not calling Nora.

143
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,966
She's about to have an embryo implanted,
so she's...

144
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,093
- Oh, my God. No way.
- Oh, my God. We could have Irish twins.

145
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,721
Yeah. Thanks, it's wonderful,
but can we just go in, please?

146
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,092
Eva's on her own in there.

147
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,319
If looks could kill, what?

148
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,946
- Shut up.
- Don't make light of this.

149
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,568
This is no fun for me, I assure you.

150
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:23,909
All I ever did was help this family.

151
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,031
- Well, that's a joke.
- Is it?

152
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,408
I cared for Blanaid.

153
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,327
I haven't said a word to her.

154
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:33,502
I came back knowing
her mother was a murderer

155
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,547
just so the poor kid
could have some sort of consistency.

156
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,423
You stole that poor kid's money.

157
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,592
- We want it back.
- I bet you do.

158
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:41,760
For her.

159
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,965
Of course.

160
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:46,640
So it makes sense that
I keep it safe until she needs it.

161
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,678
I'm gonna kill him.

162
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,096
Hello?

163
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:50,561
Hi.

164
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,396
No, I'm just home now. Call you later.

165
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,397
Fuck.

166
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,352
Why is no one answering their phones?

167
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,609
- Just--
- Christ.

168
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,357
Saise's being a pick-me and
hanging out with Charlie instead of me.

169
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,614
What a pick-me bitch.

170
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,741
- I'm gonna watch TV.
- No, Bla,

171
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,869
there's no... nothing going on here.
Why don't you...

172
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:09,246
Why don't you hang out with Molly?
Where's Molly?

173
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,790
It's a pi... pizza night.
They're at Casa Romanos.

174
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,709
- Casa Romanos.
- Casa Romanos.

175
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:15,502
You used to love Casa Romanos.

176
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,045
Why are youse all acting weird?

177
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,834
We're not. I'm gonna take you there.

178
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:20,507
I don't have my car.

179
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,342
Ian, can Urs take your car?

180
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,173
- Or Bibi's car?
- Perfect. Thank you so much.

181
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,885
We just don't want him going anywhere.

182
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,517
I'll see you, Bla.

183
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,472
Have fun. Bring us back dough balls.

184
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:40,230
- And then there were three.
- Fuck off.

185
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,576
Why aren't you at work? Una?

186
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,489
Jesus, why aren't you at work?

187
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,000
I just...

188
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:03,045
I wasn't having a great day.

189
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:08,514
It's not sorted with your friend, Loftus?

190
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,724
Doesn't matter now anyway.
He's retired. So...

191
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,393
So then you start afresh
with new people, different people.

192
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,849
No, but... They're not different.
They're all the same.

193
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:20,854
I just need to do what I'm told.

194
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,739
- What?
- You never do what you're told.

195
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,243
When you were eight, you arrested
your father for smashing my coffee table.

196
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,699
You do what's right.
You can't help yourself.

197
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,511
<i>This is Ian Reilly. Leave a message.
I'll get back to you.</i>

198
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,439
The only reason our sister is dead is you.

199
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,109
Yeah, nothing to do
with her choices at all.

200
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,862
She crashed running from you, you creep.

201
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,441
That's not what happened.

202
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,695
I told Grace about you, Eva.

203
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,036
What do you mean you told her about me?

204
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,033
The way you were always looking at me.

205
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:19,293
That it made me uncomfortable.
She was coming to you that night.

206
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:21,211
- That's a lie.
- Maybe you were next. I mean...

207
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,209
You all knew she was capable of killing
the ones she loved.

208
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,216
- Becka, stop!
- Becka!

209
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,968
- Becka, stop!
- Jesus Christ.

210
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,178
Get off her!

211
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:30,257
Jesus. Becka.

212
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:32,723
She's pregnant, you asshole.

213
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,766
Are you gonna blame me for
this one attacking me now?

214
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,685
- Oh, God.
- I'm okay.

215
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,683
I used to deal with
women like you all the time.

216
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,566
First ones to tell a fella to fuck off

217
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,777
and then the first ones to ask for
our help if it's not going your way.

218
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:46,987
Let's just go to the Guards.

219
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,025
Seriously.

220
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:51,825
I would happily do a stretch if it meant
I didn't have to listen to your shit.

221
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,572
A lot of use that would do you.

222
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:55,704
Who do you think
the Guards would listen to?

223
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,451
Why the hell would they listen to you?

224
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,876
You're a lowlife
living off vulnerable women.

225
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:03,165
Is that you, Eva?

226
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,005
Is that you you're talking about?

227
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,127
Poor, fragile you.

228
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,549
I'm a police officer, actually.

229
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,057
Bullshit.

230
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,219
Fine, think what you like.

231
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,938
But I have a lot of colleagues,
North and South,

232
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:25,275
who'd back me over a bunch of
hysterical women crying wolf again.

233
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,939
- He's lying.
- Try me.

234
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,198
If you're lucky, I won't go to the Guards

235
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:33,028
and tell them that
you covered up a murder.

236
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:38,325
And if you're lucky, I won't tell Blanaid
that her mother killed her rapist father.

237
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,204
Right?

238
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,169
Did you ever love her?

239
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,384
Because she loved you very much.

240
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,096
It's funny.

241
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,307
Grace asked me the same thing.

242
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,643
"Did you ever love me?"

243
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,231
I mean, what a question.

244
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:13,318
How could anyone love a murdering nutjob--

245
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:21,785
Shit!

246
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,501
Oh, my God.

247
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,025
- Yeah, this is a great idea, guys.
- Bla!

248
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:49,109
Isn't it?

249
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,904
Eat some pizza, hang out with
some younger folk, do a sleepover.

250
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:53,108
What's going on, Urs?

251
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,032
- Hey.
- Hi.

252
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,241
Ally. Look at you.

253
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,155
Big, happy family pizza night.

254
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,410
Okay. Look, I'm gonna see youse anon.

255
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:10,005
- Ursula.
- Ally, I--

256
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,257
I have never had a problem with you.

257
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,550
That's all. I...

258
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,930
I have always liked you and I am not
gonna try and muscle in on those kids.

259
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,384
Thank you.

260
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,845
- Oh, God.
- Thank you.

261
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,103
Okay. Sorry, I'm on
the night shift, so I've gotta rush.

262
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:28,143
I've gotta earn
the euros to buy the churros.

263
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:29,853
- Okay, bye.
- Okay.

264
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:35,275
Jesus Christ. That family is insane.

265
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,033
Sorry.

266
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,036
I didn't like what he said about Grace.

267
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,831
Is he winded?

268
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,919
Angelica, is he winded?

269
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,462
Is he winded?

270
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,005
You killed him.

271
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:58,804
Oh, my God.

272
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:00,556
Well, he's definitely...

273
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:01,760
He's...

274
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,184
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God. We...

275
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,894
- Oh, Christ.
- We killed a cop.

276
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,271
- Jesus.
- We killed a cop.

277
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,601
No. She killed a cop.

278
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,149
Angelica.

279
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:18,282
Oh, shit.

280
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:19,366
Angelica.

281
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,785
- I came over here to say I'm sorry.
- Angelica... Yeah, okay.

282
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:23,704
- And I was guided...
- Could you... Give me the...

283
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,622
- ...to come and just join you all...
- Please give me the stick.

284
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,120
- ...in your grief for Grace.
- Angelica, will you just--

285
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,165
Oh, Jesus.

286
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:34,590
It'll be Urs.

287
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,592
Urs wouldn't knock.

288
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:40,262
- A delivery then.
- I haven't ordered anything. I haven't...

289
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:43,432
It could be bath towels.

290
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:45,804
Answer it before someone looks in. Go.

291
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,647
The door's locked.

292
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:56,945
Sorry.

293
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,739
I don't know where the key is.

294
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:01,987
I can't see the key.

295
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:03,994
Go round the side door.

296
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:05,532
You wanna do that?

297
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:07,498
Shit!

298
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:10,375
Okay, it's the cops. It's that bloody cop.

299
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,044
Oh, Jesus Christ.

300
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:13,832
Oh, shit.

301
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,417
Okay.

302
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,008
Angelica.

303
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,385
Angelica, just... Please just...

304
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,763
What do I do?
Do I tell them what happened?

305
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:23,847
What should I say?

306
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:27,638
We're fucked. We're totally fucked.

307
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,189
Sorry, I...

308
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,484
I lock the front door at night.

309
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,402
It's 5:00 p.m.

310
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,656
Yeah, well, I live alone, so...

311
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,331
Right. I was just trying
to get hold of Ian Reilly.

312
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,374
Have you seen him recently?

313
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,537
No, we haven't. I haven't. Sorry.

314
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,539
I just... I'm here with my sisters.

315
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:58,048
We were just watching a box set--

316
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,920
I'm just... I can't get a hold of him.

317
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:02,469
That's weird.

318
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,848
Well, I'll just...
I'll keep you posted if I hear from him.

319
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:08,011
Pretty sure he'll be back soon.

320
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:14,101
Can I just ask what you
needed to speak to him about?

321
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:16,853
Not your concern.

322
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,108
Just watch yourselves.

323
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:28,448
Fuck me.

324
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:32,327
Is she gone?

325
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,085
The... Where... Where is he?

326
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:37,624
- Where's the...
- We put him behind the sofa.

327
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,335
- You moved the body?
- We hid him.

328
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:43,255
- What happened, Eva?
- Why...

329
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:46,096
why did you move... why'd you move the body?

330
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:49,266
- Because the cops were here.
- We didn't discuss moving the body.

331
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:51,513
- What if she walked--
- Just shut up. I need to think.

332
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:55,601
Thinking.

333
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:07,362
No, it's not.

334
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,656
Oh, my God.

335
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,202
Hiya.

336
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:17,331
- Long time no see.
- I was just in with your sister.

337
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,631
Nice. How is she?

338
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,669
Why are you driving Ian Reilly's car?

339
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,047
I...

340
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,674
I just borrowed it
to drop Blanaid to dinner.

341
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,886
It's convenient.
Let me off with a warning.

342
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,472
No, he's fully comprehensive,
as far as I know.

343
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:36,021
- Where is Mr. Reilly?
- No idea.

344
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,809
Well, have a lovely evening.

345
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:42,606
Jesus.

346
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,490
How'd you kill a man

347
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:58,497
in the time it takes
to get to Casa fucking Romanos?

348
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:01,672
- How did you kill a man...
- Urs. It...

349
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:03,423
No. Wo... Women are...

350
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,259
are supposed to just
put up with this shit, but no.

351
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,469
Oh, no, we have to kill them.

352
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:10,848
We cannot keep killing
the men who wrong us.

353
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:12,469
It was Angelica.

354
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:13,892
Yes?

355
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:16,103
Jesus. She's in shock.

356
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:18,397
Would you get her a cup
of sweet tea or a Wispa?

357
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:19,685
Get her a bloody Wispa.

358
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,527
- So you moved the body?
- We had to think on our feet.

359
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:25,404
- There was no thinking.
- Please. Will you stop? We just...

360
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:28,282
We need to figure out
what we're gonna do, okay?

361
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:31,530
And we need to do it quick.
We don't know if that cop will come back.

362
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:33,704
Thank you very much.

363
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:35,038
We get rid of him.

364
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,076
No.

365
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:39,496
We tell the cops that
Angelica killed him. Sorry.

366
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:43,005
Why should she be
punished when he's the criminal?

367
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:45,257
I think she broke a few laws
when she bludgeoned him to death.

368
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:46,967
Yeah, I'm not
taking responsibility for that.

369
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:50,048
No, no, this is on us too.

370
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:51,847
We broke her.

371
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:52,890
He was a cop.

372
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,517
They all look after each other.
Even the bad ones.

373
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:58,312
No, you're right. We get rid of him.

374
00:24:58,332 --> 00:24:59,313
Are you insane?

375
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,231
They'll never believe
we weren't involved, okay?

376
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:04,151
If we get rid of the body now,
there's a chance we'd get away with it.

377
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:07,608
- So we take him back to Donegal.
- What are you talking about?

378
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:11,283
They know Ian Reilly is missing.
They're out looking for him.

379
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:12,993
Ian Reilly isn't missing.

380
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:14,620
Oh, my God. Am I losing my marbles?

381
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,074
There is no Ian Reilly.

382
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:21,038
It's Cormac Sweeney who's dead
and we've never even met him.

383
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:26,168
We could drive him to those cliffs.
Sliabh Liag.

384
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:31,929
Throw the body over,
make it look like he lost his footing.

385
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:33,175
Are you...

386
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:35,140
This is horrible.

387
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,095
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

388
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,598
So is the alternative.

389
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:43,477
It's a good plan.

390
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,120
Okay, that's not gonna work.

391
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,956
What if we...

392
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:00,874
Can't we just put him in,
like, child's pose or something?

393
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,251
It's not big enough.

394
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:04,044
Can I make anyone a cup of tea?

395
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,672
- I'm no use to any of youse at all.
- It's fine, Angelica. Just...

396
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:08,715
Just go in. Just go back inside.

397
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,592
What the actual fuck
are we gonna do about her?

398
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:11,760
Poor thing's off her nut.

399
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,595
I don't care. Let's just deal with this.

400
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,133
This is heavy, lads.

401
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:18,637
Okay, let's just use your car.

402
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:20,644
What?

403
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:21,937
I'm not into that.

404
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:23,021
You're not into it?

405
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,107
She can't drive
with a dead body in the boot.

406
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:26,483
She's barely got her license a year.

407
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:28,814
Fine, I'll drive. I'll drive.

408
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:30,816
I just had it cleaned.

409
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:46,665
Oh, Jesus. Your poor eye.
I could kill him.

410
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:50,252
All right.

411
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:53,010
If we're going, we should go.
You stay here.

412
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,178
No, I should be with my sisters.

413
00:26:54,198 --> 00:26:56,513
No, you're pregnant
and you've already got an injury.

414
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:59,850
- No, I'm coming.
- Okay, fine. Let's just go.

415
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:02,019
Wait. What about Ian's car?

416
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,640
It can't stay here.

417
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:08,520
Look, I've made
some sandwiches for the journey.

418
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:12,232
Ham and coleslaw.

419
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:51,401
<i>This is Tom O'Rourke,
and after the break, I'll be bringing you</i>

420
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:55,359
<i>back to the '70s right here on 95.6 FM.</i>

421
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:58,116
- Who'd wanna go back to the '70s?
- <i>...for our regular listeners</i>.

422
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:00,530
Me. Right now.

423
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:03,116
This guy's annoying me.

424
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:06,578
<i>...you never know what you'll end up
talking about on this show. He's--</i>

425
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:09,289
There. He's gone.

426
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:29,064
Holy God.

427
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:30,732
Who the hell is...

428
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,980
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

429
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,652
What are you doing, you mad bitch?

430
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:48,245
Oh, God. Oh, God... Christ.

431
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:57,676
Can I help you, Guard?

432
00:28:57,696 --> 00:29:00,304
Are youse playing musical cars or what?

433
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:02,968
Can I ask why
you're driving Ian Reilly's car?

434
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:06,930
Does Mr. Reilly know
that you have his car?

435
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:09,516
No.

436
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:14,104
Would you mind stepping out?

437
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,958
I've changed my mind. I'm not ready.

438
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:37,299
To open it?

439
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,675
No. For what happens after.

440
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:42,507
Nothing's gonna happen, okay?
We have it covered.

441
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,260
Are we sure?

442
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:47,387
Of course we're sure.

443
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:05,536
Oh, my God!

444
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:07,658
- Fuck!
- Oh, my God!

445
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:25,639
Fuck. Shit. Shit.

446
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:28,261
Quiet. Be quiet. Will you be quiet?

447
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:29,977
Is he alive, Eva?

448
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:32,933
- Yeah.
- He's gonna be so cross with us.

449
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:36,061
Was that him?

450
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,031
Are you okay? What was that?

451
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:45,195
The boot just springs open
like that sometimes.

452
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:46,910
What?

453
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,913
It's an old car. That's just how...
It just pops open.

454
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:51,451
Oh, God.

455
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:53,375
Then why did we run?

456
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:54,626
You all ran, I followed.

457
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:57,749
- You frightened the shit out of me.
- You frightened the shit out of me.

458
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:04,423
Okay. Come on.

459
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:13,348
Becka.

460
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:15,434
- Come on.
- I don't want to.

461
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:17,978
Come on.

462
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:28,363
What the hell?

463
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,248
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

464
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:34,578
What?

465
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:36,251
What is happening?

466
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:39,671
- I'm gonna be sick.
- You didn't check for a pulse?

467
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:42,299
You're the bloody nurse,
why didn't you check it?

468
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,260
- Because you said he was bloody dead.
- He was dead.

469
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,887
Well, he's definitely not dead.

470
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,055
There was no pulse.

471
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:50,599
Okay, look, at least nobody's dead.

472
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:53,101
Right? That's the...
the upside of the whole...

473
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:54,228
We haven't killed anyone.

474
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:55,395
Yeah, that's the upside.

475
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,935
- Where is he though?
- Fuck's sake.

476
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,525
Guys?

477
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:01,693
- What?
- Oh, shit.

478
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:04,404
Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, shit.

479
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:06,526
- What do we do?
- Shut up.

480
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:09,868
Don't move.

481
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:11,954
- Can he see us?
- Just quiet.

482
00:32:11,974 --> 00:32:13,492
Oh, God. Oh, shit.

483
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,956
Ian. Ian. Ian!

484
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:30,634
Oh, no. This is terrible.

485
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,472
- Becka. No.
- Becka.

486
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:38,350
Becka. Be careful.

487
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:49,194
Oh, my God.

488
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:52,030
- What?
- What?

489
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:54,872
Come on.

490
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:57,369
That is fucking ridiculous.

491
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,413
This is a nightmare.

492
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:02,129
Oh, no!

493
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:05,090
He's wearing my robe!

494
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:08,177
Oh, no. That's not good.
I think I stitched your name in it.

495
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:09,881
I've had enough of this shit.

496
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:12,014
What are you doing?

497
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:14,141
- I'm gonna push him off.
- You are not going to push him off.

498
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:15,726
- Bibi! No!
- Bibi!

499
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:17,603
- Christ!
- You get back here!

500
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:19,229
- No, do not...
- Bibi, you're gonna fall!

501
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:21,607
I know what I'm doing!
Let's just finish it.

502
00:33:21,627 --> 00:33:24,980
- No!
- Bibi. No.

503
00:33:28,217 --> 00:33:29,318
Bibi.

504
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,696
- Give me your hand.
- Just mind the rock.

505
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,656
Careful!

506
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:36,992
- Do you have me?
- Pull her!

507
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:38,994
I've got you. Pull!

508
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,121
Come on.

509
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,671
You stupid cow. You could have died.

510
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,710
- Thank God.
- Fuck.

511
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,430
What are we gonna do about him?

512
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,386
What now, Eva? What now?

513
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,315
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna call for help.

514
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,983
What?

515
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:07,736
So we just go to prison for that pig?
We just give up. Is that it?

516
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:09,149
No. We just...

517
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,782
We say it was an accident or we just...

518
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:14,201
we take our chances. Okay?
But this ends now.

519
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:15,869
You don't get to make that decision.

520
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,955
Just... No. Just...
We can't leave him there!

521
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:19,493
- Fuck him.
- We're not murderers.

522
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,121
We're not.

523
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:34,508
Hello.

524
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:39,638
We just saw someone
go over Sliabh Liag cliffs.

525
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,478
Yeah. I'm looking at him now. He's...

526
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:46,478
He's conscious
but he's got a bad head injury.

527
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:49,189
He's got a couple of head injuries.

528
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:52,776
Can we just get an ambulance urgently?

529
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:02,703
We did the right thing.

530
00:35:12,863 --> 00:35:14,172
What's that?

531
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:15,804
What do we think?

532
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:17,509
- Run.
- Let's just go.

533
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:20,846
Oh, shit.

534
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:23,307
My knee.

535
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:36,450
I'm gonna put on some music.

536
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,988
Maybe Radio 4.

537
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:40,365
Something soothing.

538
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:48,874
Yeah. That's nice.

539
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:19,952
Oh, shit.

540
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:22,788
Why is Ian's car still here? Fuck's sake.

541
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:24,790
I don't know why
you asked Angelica to move it.

542
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,662
She was in no fit state.

543
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:34,711
Oh, God love her.

544
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:39,091
Hey.

545
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:42,594
Some walk of shame.

546
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:44,179
Big night?

547
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:46,598
Nobody move.

548
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:56,817
Somebody open the boot.

549
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:00,988
- Somebody move.
- Sorry.

550
00:37:05,184 --> 00:37:08,412
Sorry, it just does that sometimes.

551
00:37:10,147 --> 00:37:12,045
- Where is he?
- Where's who?

552
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:13,375
Ian Reilly.

553
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:15,502
- Never heard of him.
- Becka.

554
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:18,255
Well, Angelica told me
that she killed him. Is that true?

555
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:20,549
Not...

556
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:23,140
No.

557
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,847
She said that you put his body in the boot
with the intention of disposing of it.

558
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,151
Right, I'm arresting all of you.

559
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:36,153
- No, wait.
- Just... No, no, no. Please. Please.

560
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:38,989
Just take me, not them
because God will forgive me.

561
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:41,153
- Just leave the sisters out--
- He's not dead!

562
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:44,244
Angelica, you didn't kill anyone.

563
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:47,164
I didn't kill him? Thank God.

564
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:49,041
I was sure I killed him.

565
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:51,543
I mean, all that blood. I mean...

566
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:53,128
Do you mean it's not murder?

567
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:54,880
But will it still be attempted murder?

568
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,460
- Angelica, shut up.
- Everybody inside.

569
00:37:57,236 --> 00:37:58,587
All of youse, now.

570
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,882
- We were mopping up for hours.
- Go inside.

571
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:12,481
When I say, "I'm going to the toilet,"

572
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:14,191
you say you're going
to the toilet too, okay?

573
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:15,734
Go to the toilet,
and you go to the toilet.

574
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:18,445
- Yeah. I need to go to the toilet.
- I need to go to the toilet too.

575
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:20,567
No, nobody's going to the toilet.

576
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:25,364
You know, I prayed for this.

577
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:29,201
I prayed and the Lord listened.

578
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:30,999
I mean, it's another miracle.

579
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:32,626
- Sure.
- Okay.

580
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:35,916
I'm gonna ask youse again. Where is he?

581
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:39,633
He had an accident,

582
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:41,927
and we called an ambulance.

583
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:43,340
What hospital was he taken to?

584
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:45,973
I don't know. I don't kn--

585
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:47,850
I should bring him a bottle of something.

586
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,726
- Apologize.
- Please, can you just...

587
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:51,014
can you just be quiet, please?

588
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:55,769
Where were you
when you called the ambulance?

589
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,523
- Where were we when we--
- Sliabh Liag.

590
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:02,234
At the cliff's edge.

591
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:07,828
Sorry.

592
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:09,992
Wait, are you calling the Guards?

593
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:12,708
- I am the Guards.
- Yeah, but I mean--

594
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:17,207
I don't think that you all understand
how much trouble youse are in.

595
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:22,551
- <i>Hello? Are you there?</i>
- Yes. Yes.

596
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:25,387
Kavanagh. Can you...

597
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:27,389
Can you check if Cormac Sweeney

598
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:30,851
has been taken into whatever
hospital's close to the Sliabh Liag area?

599
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:32,222
<i>Will do.</i>

600
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:34,730
You know his name.

601
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,689
Can you sit down, please?

602
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,061
- What the hell?
- Just... Can you just sit down?

603
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:42,529
I've only just found that out.
I haven't known it--

604
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:43,614
Wait. What's going on?

605
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:44,656
She knows about Ian.

606
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:46,783
Yeah, well, like I said,
I hadn't long worked that out.

607
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:48,368
And I am sorry about your sister, but--

608
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:50,240
You're sorry about our sister?

609
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:52,456
Loftus lied about Grace too.

610
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:54,202
She wasn't running away.

611
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:56,752
She died trying to get away from Ian.

612
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:59,087
From what I was told,
the money was found in the car.

613
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:00,464
That's crap.

614
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:02,419
You're just trying
to cover up for your mate.

615
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:05,047
Did you know Cormac Sweeney was a cop?

616
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:07,679
Is that why you kept it quiet?
'Cause he's one of yours?

617
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:09,640
No.

618
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,266
I wouldn't do that.

619
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:13,263
You waited for us to come back.

620
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:14,765
Why?

621
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,524
Well, because...

622
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:20,192
because I needed the facts.
Because I needed to--

623
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:21,944
You could have taken
Angelica to the station.

624
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:25,447
You could have been out looking for us.
Why didn't you?

625
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:28,450
It's because you're covering up
criminal behavior.

626
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:31,578
No. What they did
has nothing to do with me.

627
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:34,826
But you're the Guards, you said.

628
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:44,920
Look, I...

629
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:47,881
I tried to help Grace.

630
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,472
And I wanna help you now.

631
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:51,885
Then do.

632
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,264
Help us.

633
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:08,694
Hello?

634
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:12,281
Okay.

635
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:15,909
Okay, thank you.

636
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:20,914
He's alive, right?

637
00:41:22,316 --> 00:41:23,417
Yeah.

638
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:28,630
Our sister's dead.

639
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:32,384
What more punishment do we need?

640
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:03,749
I need your help.

641
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:12,466
What do we do now?

642
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:14,760
Pray?

643
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:18,347
Worked for Angelica.
Brought Ian back from the dead.

644
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,774
Angelica. Angelica, it's...

645
00:42:23,794 --> 00:42:26,229
it's probably time to head home now.

646
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:29,399
Well...

647
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:35,410
I am sorry about what I said.

648
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,032
No, listen, we...

649
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:39,998
We lost our minds a bit, I think.

650
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:42,459
And we're sorry about the boat.

651
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:43,664
Aye, sure.

652
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:46,917
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

653
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:49,544
Am I right, girls?

654
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:05,185
You're going to have to stop
disappearing on me.

655
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:07,479
I was worried about you.

656
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:09,940
What happened?

657
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:13,907
Angelica? Talk to me.

658
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:15,279
Maybe I can help.

659
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:18,532
No, you've helped enough.

660
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:21,451
Put the kettle on.

661
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:25,961
Were you at the Garveys? Nice time?

662
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:27,874
Yeah, they are great girls.

663
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:34,178
God.

664
00:43:34,198 --> 00:43:36,425
I need to lie down
before I have a heart attack.

665
00:43:37,201 --> 00:43:38,719
I need to see Joe.

666
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:04,786
Jesus Christ.

667
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:07,539
Good to see you too.

668
00:44:08,774 --> 00:44:10,292
What happened to you?

669
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:13,879
The Garveys tried to kill me.

670
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:15,756
Twice.

671
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,217
I'm gonna make you press charges.

672
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:22,059
Yeah, well, you can try that.

673
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,765
They'll have their own
stories though, of course.

674
00:44:25,707 --> 00:44:28,769
You ripping them off,
causing their sister's death.

675
00:44:30,921 --> 00:44:33,195
If you had any evidence

676
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:35,197
that I was involved
in the death of a woman,

677
00:44:35,217 --> 00:44:37,361
you wouldn't be here on your own.

678
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:43,288
You know, that Garda badge
doesn't make you invincible.

679
00:44:43,308 --> 00:44:44,993
Beg your pardon?

680
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:49,831
May I?

681
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:52,167
Yeah.

682
00:44:55,404 --> 00:44:56,380
You're looking well.

683
00:44:57,322 --> 00:44:59,591
I was just catching up
with Cormac Sweeney here.

684
00:45:00,284 --> 00:45:02,302
The artist formerly known as.

685
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:05,806
Yeah, you've been a very naughty boy
from what I hear.

686
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:11,019
Fraud, embezzlement, bigamy, of course.

687
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,068
Old school.

688
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:15,023
Spousal abuse.

689
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:18,740
And thrown out of the PSNI.

690
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,487
I didn't even think that was possible.

691
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:24,241
He was just saying that
the Garvey sisters tried to kill him.

692
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:26,451
Well, that's just silly.

693
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:29,454
No, they would have succeeded.

694
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:31,503
I've checked with the Garveys' whereabouts

695
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:33,005
and they were nowhere near you that night.

696
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:34,798
Bullshit. You know they f--

697
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:38,964
The thing is,
I will contradict every word you say,

698
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:41,925
and I will destroy evidence if I have to.

699
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,303
I'm dodgy like that.

700
00:45:45,078 --> 00:45:46,346
A bit like you.

701
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:52,519
And you're not the only one
with pals in the PSNI.

702
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:54,187
Me too.

703
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:57,404
So you'll give Blanaid's money back
to the Garvey sisters

704
00:45:57,424 --> 00:45:59,323
and we'll call it an accident.

705
00:45:59,343 --> 00:46:01,445
Yeah. And a miracle, am I right?

706
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:05,532
Yeah, you should count
your lucky stars you're still here.

707
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:13,253
<i>I'll deny everything, am I clear?</i>

708
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:14,458
Crystal.

709
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:17,216
And we're even stephens now.

710
00:46:17,236 --> 00:46:18,342
Even stephens.

711
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:20,385
And you watch yourself, all right?

712
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:22,429
You can't just hand out lone justice.

713
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:24,264
You'll get yourself fired.

714
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:26,642
Yeah, it's okay. I'm packing in the job.

715
00:46:26,662 --> 00:46:27,929
What?

716
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:31,814
Well, it's not what I thought
it was gonna be.

717
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:33,732
And I'm not sure
it's who I wanna be either.

718
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:36,939
Houlihan, I don't mind telling you

719
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:41,234
that I found your personality
very challenging.

720
00:46:42,678 --> 00:46:44,696
And your wardrobe too.

721
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:48,325
But with the likes of me leaving
and you sticking around...

722
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:51,458
I mean, the place
would only get more broken

723
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:53,121
if someone as good as you goes.

724
00:46:55,941 --> 00:46:57,084
Think about it.

725
00:47:33,854 --> 00:47:34,918
Hey.

726
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:38,333
There she is,
rubbing our noses in her pious bullshit.

727
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:42,467
What, like you rubbing my nose
in Beyoncé at 4:00 in the morning?

728
00:47:42,487 --> 00:47:44,631
Your voice has gotten more
horrible over the years, by the way.

729
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:46,925
How dare you?

730
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:51,555
Not sure I'm in a fit state for this.

731
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:55,267
Well, there'll never be a right time.

732
00:47:57,252 --> 00:47:58,233
How's Bla?

733
00:47:58,253 --> 00:47:59,438
She's...

734
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:02,149
She's quiet still, you know.

735
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:04,109
Let's see.

736
00:48:05,594 --> 00:48:08,655
Hey, walking partner.

737
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:11,992
What were you talking about?

738
00:48:12,768 --> 00:48:15,871
Just, you know, nothing.

739
00:48:16,438 --> 00:48:20,500
It's okay. You can be cagey about it
like you're cagey about everything.

740
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:23,795
No. Don't say that.

741
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:29,217
I know you're trying to protect me
but I'm not deaf and I'm not blind.

742
00:48:29,826 --> 00:48:30,927
How do you mean?

743
00:48:31,328 --> 00:48:32,346
My dad.

744
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,724
I know he wasn't a good person,
but that's not me.

745
00:48:36,124 --> 00:48:37,559
I know who I am.

746
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:41,939
I know how good my mam was,
and that's who I am.

747
00:48:42,923 --> 00:48:45,651
That's what I think about,
not the other stuff.

748
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:49,613
Jesus, Bla,
you haven't even had any therapy yet.

749
00:48:58,564 --> 00:48:59,873
- Shall we go?
- Yeah.

750
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:13,905
Okay.

751
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:17,784
- Okay. Ready?
- Yeah.

752
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:43,685
How do we say goodbye?

753
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:53,570
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, Gracie.

754
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:09,842
- We love you, Gracie.
- We love you, Grace.

755
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:11,760
- Love you, Gracie.
- I love you, Mam.

756
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,257
- We love you!
- Bye-bye, Grace.
