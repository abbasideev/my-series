1
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:17,055
That's it. Come on. Keep on going.

2
00:00:17,622 --> 00:00:19,474
Nine, eight-- Raise your knees! Seven...

3
00:00:21,209 --> 00:00:23,811
Three, two, one.

4
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:26,689
How are you finding
the adjusted testosterone dose?

5
00:00:27,715 --> 00:00:28,821
I wanna hit you more.

6
00:00:28,841 --> 00:00:29,989
How about your libido?

7
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:34,572
Oh, Jesus, Eileen. I'm old. I'm grieving.

8
00:00:35,473 --> 00:00:37,700
And actually, I'm happy on my own.

9
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:40,536
I don't need sex anymore, I've decided.

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,998
I'm 50.

11
00:00:45,024 --> 00:00:46,292
Today, actually.

12
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:48,800
I'm done with all that.

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,635
You are not done.

14
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:52,095
And happy birthday,

15
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:55,468
you smoking hot, mid-century legend.

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,142
And hey, I'd do you.

17
00:00:58,162 --> 00:00:59,555
Thanks.

18
00:01:06,337 --> 00:01:07,981
Seriously though, how are you feeling?

19
00:01:11,634 --> 00:01:12,986
I don't know.

20
00:01:14,512 --> 00:01:16,239
I don't know. I just--

21
00:01:19,017 --> 00:01:20,952
I just miss her on such a deep--

22
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:25,336
I just-- I miss her so deeply, like in my...

23
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:27,709
No, I'm grand for hugs.

24
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:30,962
I'm too angry for hugs.

25
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:35,555
I just feel like her death
was so completely avoidable.

26
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:38,474
If I'd just kept a closer watch on her
after everything.

27
00:01:38,494 --> 00:01:40,430
What's everything?

28
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:44,814
Just knowing what was going on
in her head a bit more,

29
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:46,065
I would've been able to help her.

30
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:49,027
And minding Bla
it's way harder than I thought.

31
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:51,070
Suddenly, I'm not her favorite auntie
anymore, you know?

32
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,568
I'm just some basic bitch.

33
00:01:55,136 --> 00:01:57,322
Do you wanna go for a cure-all dip?

34
00:01:58,514 --> 00:02:00,241
No, I've gotta meet the coven.

35
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:03,625
Bibi heard someone calling us that
in town yesterday.

36
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:05,543
Wear it with pride.

37
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:07,957
See you soon.

38
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,175
I've a new client.

39
00:02:12,195 --> 00:02:13,963
You know, your one, Angelica?

40
00:02:15,323 --> 00:02:16,763
How funny is that?

41
00:02:16,783 --> 00:02:18,718
She couldn't stop talking about you.

42
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:34,507
Where are you all?

43
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:37,547
Why is no one answering their phones?
We still have to plan.

44
00:03:42,118 --> 00:03:43,469
Is the door not open?

45
00:03:44,245 --> 00:03:48,224
I swear to God,
I've never wanted to kill that wagon more.

46
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:51,191
The door was open.

47
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:53,276
What wagon did you wanna kill?

48
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:56,821
No one. Just my sister, Ursula.

49
00:03:56,841 --> 00:04:00,611
She's late and a bitch.
Well, you've met her.

50
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:02,405
Yeah.

51
00:04:03,973 --> 00:04:07,248
Well, we just wanted to chat
if that's okay with you.

52
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:08,578
No.

53
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:11,961
Well, I mean, it's my birthday.

54
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:13,796
Also, there's stuff to plan.

55
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:16,794
We're scattering our sister's ashes.

56
00:04:17,487 --> 00:04:18,837
It won't take long,

57
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:22,597
just wanted to ask you about
the money Becka told us was missing.

58
00:04:22,617 --> 00:04:25,219
The money your sister
took out the day she died.

59
00:04:27,664 --> 00:04:30,391
Well, I don't know
what that was all about.

60
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:32,524
Was she in some kind of trouble?

61
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:35,688
Had someone been threatening her,
anything like that?

62
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:37,190
Are you sure?

63
00:04:37,715 --> 00:04:39,239
Yeah, I'm sure.

64
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:43,076
Was Becka looking for the money
in Angelica Collins's house?

65
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:44,160
Did you not ask her?

66
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,574
You had her locked up long enough.

67
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:51,376
{\an8}- Sir? Return the call.
- Fuck's sake.

68
00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:52,914
I've got this.

69
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:56,923
Well, I've got, you know,
stuff I have to be getting on with.

70
00:04:56,943 --> 00:04:58,675
A lot of organizing.

71
00:04:58,695 --> 00:05:00,630
Yeah, one question. Then, I'll head.

72
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:05,265
Isn't it strange that you don't know why
Grace needed that money.

73
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,554
Seem to let each other
into every part of your lives.

74
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:10,854
You really have no idea?

75
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:13,643
I don't know, sneaky facelift.

76
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:20,363
Will you sign for this?

77
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:21,990
It's nice that they met, you know, after...

78
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,034
Sometimes it's worth putting yourself
out there. Online, I mean.

79
00:05:25,054 --> 00:05:26,703
How'd you mean, online?

80
00:05:26,723 --> 00:05:29,075
They met at a bereavement group.

81
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:31,749
- Ian lost his sister. But, yeah...
- Thank you.

82
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,459
...good to put yourself out there.

83
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,253
I'm not being stubborn.

84
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:38,042
I told you, I'm busy at work.
I will call you later.

85
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,884
I just signed for it.

86
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:43,344
Don't forget to bend your knees
when you're picking it up.

87
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:44,966
We'll see you again.

88
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,809
So Ian told us that he met Grace online,

89
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:51,895
but Eva's just said that they met
at a bereavement group,

90
00:05:51,915 --> 00:05:53,688
which is a weird thing
to lie about, right?

91
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,143
Yeah. Which one's lying?

92
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:56,566
Let's get the thumbscrews out.

93
00:05:56,586 --> 00:05:59,068
Yeah, if your spidey's are tingling,
go see him.

94
00:05:59,088 --> 00:06:01,988
Hey, bring him back Grace's effects.
Catch him off guard.

95
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:03,907
I've got family stuff to take care of.

96
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:05,575
Was that Nadine on the phone?

97
00:06:05,595 --> 00:06:09,746
Yeah, and her ole fella,
threatening to wheeze me into submission.

98
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:11,414
Here, what do you think of him?

99
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:13,750
- Like, as a man.
- Of Nadine's fella?

100
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,413
No, Ian.

101
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:18,416
No, he's not my type.

102
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:48,196
Seriously, get over here.

103
00:06:54,143 --> 00:06:57,205
Sorry, I'm late. What's that?

104
00:06:57,605 --> 00:07:00,124
Grace sent Eva a present from the grave.

105
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:01,798
No.

106
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:03,461
Seriously?

107
00:07:04,612 --> 00:07:05,969
I didn't get you anything.

108
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:07,220
You never get me anything.

109
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,633
I love you.

110
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,184
It's almost a directive
from Gracie to throw a party.

111
00:07:13,204 --> 00:07:15,687
No. Wha--
No, we're not going to do a party.

112
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:17,475
There's too much going on.

113
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:20,311
Had the Guards here earlier
asking about the money.

114
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,854
Sorry.

115
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:25,817
And Angelica's
taken things to the next level.

116
00:07:26,217 --> 00:07:27,860
She's hired Eileen.

117
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,490
My trainer, Eileen.

118
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:35,248
Well, it's a warning, isn't it?

119
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:36,749
She's a loose cannon.

120
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:37,876
It's hardly a horse's head.

121
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:40,879
I don't give a shit
about your menopause nanny.

122
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,298
She had Becka looking at jail time.

123
00:07:43,318 --> 00:07:45,049
She scared Grace to her grave.

124
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:47,051
She is lucky she's still walking.

125
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:48,803
I can't go to jail now.

126
00:07:48,823 --> 00:07:50,430
Yeah. Save your own skin, Becka.

127
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,682
- It's not that. Shut up!
- You shut up.

128
00:07:52,702 --> 00:07:54,851
If the cops find out
what that money was for,

129
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:56,895
they're closer to finding out
what we all did, okay?

130
00:07:56,915 --> 00:08:01,144
So we give Angelica what she wants
and then we just disengage.

131
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:03,860
We're not really gonna give her
Gracie's ashes though, are we?

132
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,738
No, we're not. We'll clean out my hearth.

133
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:10,158
She'll be scattering the ashes
of briquettes and takeaway cartons.

134
00:08:10,178 --> 00:08:12,155
You really shouldn't burn that stuff.

135
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,325
Oh, my God, that's her.

136
00:08:19,854 --> 00:08:20,955
Don't answer it.

137
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:25,752
Angelica, hi.

138
00:08:26,861 --> 00:08:30,256
Well-- Okay, then we'll come to you.

139
00:08:32,242 --> 00:08:34,432
Okay, bye.

140
00:08:34,452 --> 00:08:37,101
She wants to discuss the details
with us at high noon.

141
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:38,770
Did she really say high noon?

142
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,141
No, she said midday in fairness.

143
00:08:50,093 --> 00:08:51,819
Good morning and welcome.

144
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:54,786
I can't stay long.
I have to take Ruben to the dentist.

145
00:08:54,806 --> 00:08:58,581
Busy lives you all lead,
but there's always time for a cuppa.

146
00:08:58,601 --> 00:09:02,168
Yeah, I've gotta get back to Bla too, so...

147
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:03,336
The wee pet.

148
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:05,713
I mean, she is a credit to Grace.

149
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:10,880
Yeah. You wanted
to discuss the details, Angelica...

150
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:12,924
Grace's ashes.

151
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:17,053
Becka, how do you take your tea?

152
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,348
I'm not a big tea drinker.

153
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,977
Yeah, not big on apologies either.

154
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,487
I'm sorry for shoving you.

155
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:38,282
And for breaking in.

156
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:41,869
And the rabbit?

157
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:44,414
Gaybo's been found.

158
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:46,171
He's back with me now.

159
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:47,625
Poor bastard.

160
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:49,752
- Sugar?
- Three.

161
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:52,213
Three.

162
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:56,384
You're fierce good to yourself,
as Mammy used to say.

163
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:02,270
Now, this is really a very modern idea,

164
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,476
but I feel that Grace would like it

165
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:07,734
if we scattered her at sea.

166
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:08,938
What?

167
00:10:10,173 --> 00:10:12,525
Have you any idea
how much the sea meant to her?

168
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,659
You know, we could take one
of those tours of Dublin Bay,

169
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:19,913
and we could just, you know,
scatter her ashes along the way.

170
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:23,082
And then I could bake
some of Grace's flapjacks.

171
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:25,204
We could fill a flask.

172
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,956
We can make a day of it.

173
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:31,502
I'd really love your help on this.

174
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:36,633
I have dropped the charges.

175
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:39,682
And I'd hate to go back to the Guards.

176
00:10:39,702 --> 00:10:41,554
I know where my pal keeps his boat.

177
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:44,312
He's away. He won't mind.

178
00:10:44,332 --> 00:10:47,727
Great, but no Blanaid.

179
00:10:48,253 --> 00:10:49,234
We have to protect her.

180
00:10:49,254 --> 00:10:50,985
- Yeah.
- And no Ian,

181
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:52,523
because I don't feel safe around him.

182
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:55,443
Tea, Eva?

183
00:10:56,886 --> 00:10:58,201
Yeah, no, I'm good.

184
00:10:58,221 --> 00:11:02,539
So, tomorrow, noon, the marina.

185
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,960
Yeah, and maybe you should stay at home
and you know, mind Blanaid.

186
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,379
- But Eva's coming.
- Eva has to be there.

187
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,839
I'm sad to say this,

188
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:14,712
but I don't think you've been
respecting Grace's memory of late.

189
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:16,886
What are you on about?

190
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:19,425
You and Ian comforting each other

191
00:11:20,577 --> 00:11:21,803
shamelessly.

192
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:25,890
Oh, my God.

193
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:27,850
Unbelievable.

194
00:11:33,798 --> 00:11:35,405
There's nothing going on
between me and Ian.

195
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:36,948
We know that. She's just shit-stirring.

196
00:11:36,968 --> 00:11:39,284
It's just-- You know,
we're rearing a child together,

197
00:11:39,304 --> 00:11:41,160
which is-- you know,

198
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,284
it's weird and intimate
and-- That's totally the wrong word.

199
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,829
Wagon!

200
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:50,712
You still wanna humor her?

201
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:52,964
Yeah, because I got hauled in.

202
00:11:52,984 --> 00:11:55,712
You couldn't bloody vamoose fast enough.

203
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:58,845
- Come on!
- Do you think this party's a good idea?

204
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:01,509
- She's a lot on her plate.
- Exactly why she needs one.

205
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:03,469
And I've swapped my shift now.

206
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:19,610
It's open if you wanna get in there.

207
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:21,993
Check out my cup holders.

208
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:25,992
I wanted to return Grace's
personal effects that have been processed.

209
00:12:29,604 --> 00:12:30,793
Oh, sorry.

210
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:33,213
I've also been tasked
with just following up on a few details

211
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:34,751
if you've got a minute.

212
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:53,645
- Death admin.
- Thanks.

213
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:56,397
It's time-consuming.

214
00:12:56,881 --> 00:12:58,733
This house has me beat.

215
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:00,657
Who's this?

216
00:13:00,677 --> 00:13:02,575
That's my sister, Colleen.

217
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:06,282
She died two years ago in Canada.

218
00:13:09,227 --> 00:13:10,745
I'm sorry to hear that.

219
00:13:13,022 --> 00:13:14,707
Might you go back
to the bereavement group?

220
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:17,835
Angelica Collins's?

221
00:13:18,486 --> 00:13:21,719
That one. No, I don't think so.

222
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:23,841
Well, I understand
that you met Grace there.

223
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:26,552
You told us it was online...

224
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:29,519
Well, we met online first.

225
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:31,724
Initially the group was online.

226
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,685
Did it help?

227
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,778
Well, meeting Grace did.

228
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:44,487
But, Angelica,
it's like she feeds off your grief.

229
00:13:45,722 --> 00:13:49,701
Grace and I used to joke
that she got high on our lows.

230
00:13:50,727 --> 00:13:53,287
Sorry, that is awful to say.

231
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:55,957
One more question.

232
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:59,377
Grace withdrew 20,000
the day that she crashed.

233
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,218
Do you know about that?

234
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:03,423
No idea.

235
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:06,639
I mean,
unless it was something for Blanaid,

236
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:09,017
but she would have told me.

237
00:14:09,037 --> 00:14:10,430
Yeah, you think?

238
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,518
So, did you get those few details
you came for, Detective?

239
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:17,895
I did, Mr. Reilly, yeah.

240
00:14:19,756 --> 00:14:21,357
And I'm sorry for your loss.

241
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:25,194
Well, your losses.

242
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,330
School's okay?

243
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,417
Yeah. Don't know. It's all right.

244
00:14:34,437 --> 00:14:38,166
There's a girl who I sit with
in Spanish who's Spanish.

245
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:41,382
Nice. Handy.

246
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:43,004
Yeah.

247
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:45,131
How do you feel about Australia?

248
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:49,218
Who will look after Prince when I go?

249
00:14:49,786 --> 00:14:50,808
Prince?

250
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:52,393
Cathy's pony.

251
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:54,812
I'll miss my friends.

252
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:57,226
It's too far away, Dad. I don't wanna go.

253
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:03,279
They can go if they love it so much.

254
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:05,448
If it's such a great place.

255
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:07,820
You can mind me, right?

256
00:15:08,638 --> 00:15:11,324
- Dad?
- Yeah, of course I can.

257
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:16,079
Hey, I'll fix it, Jess, all right?
I promise.

258
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:18,414
Swear, Dad?

259
00:15:20,108 --> 00:15:21,501
I swear.

260
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:25,505
Come here.

261
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,058
<i>Hi, it's Nadine.</i>

262
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:34,847
<i>Leave a message
and I'll get back to you when I can.</i>

263
00:15:35,498 --> 00:15:39,352
I'm gonna fight you for custody,
and I'm gonna win.

264
00:15:41,838 --> 00:15:43,898
How's that for stubbornness?

265
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:06,963
Hey.

266
00:16:07,614 --> 00:16:08,715
Hiya.

267
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:13,099
There's something blocking your gutters.

268
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:14,721
Want me to take a look?

269
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,020
No, I'll do it.

270
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,522
No one's looking for 50-year-old
finance managers anymore

271
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:21,816
so it could be the start
of a new career for me.

272
00:16:21,836 --> 00:16:24,522
Shit shoveler. Perfect.

273
00:16:27,383 --> 00:16:30,033
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. No.

274
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:32,238
A present arrived from Grace earlier.

275
00:16:33,223 --> 00:16:34,490
Karaoke machine.

276
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:38,536
She was so bloody organized.

277
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:41,873
- Eva--
- Sorry.

278
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:47,629
Sorry, I feel bad because
you lost her too, but--

279
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,007
Today's really hard.

280
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:52,884
I'm not...

281
00:16:56,704 --> 00:16:58,222
I just feel very lonely.

282
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,475
Hey...

283
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:05,438
come here.

284
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:11,361
I won't let you get lonely.

285
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:14,035
Or we can be lonely together.

286
00:17:14,055 --> 00:17:15,869
I mean, not, like, together together--

287
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:17,867
- Yeah, no, I know.
- Yeah.

288
00:17:21,061 --> 00:17:23,790
- Thank you.
- Here.

289
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:28,842
This can't compete,
but I got you a present.

290
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:30,088
Happy birthday.

291
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:33,257
My favorite pope.

292
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:36,511
Hi, Francis. Thank you.

293
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:40,848
I thought you could do with a fresh pair.

294
00:17:41,374 --> 00:17:43,393
You noticed my disgusting slippers?

295
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:47,151
I love them.

296
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:48,523
Thank you.

297
00:17:53,678 --> 00:17:57,198
So, we had tea with Angelica earlier.

298
00:17:57,891 --> 00:17:58,992
Yeah?

299
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:01,411
She said she didn't feel safe around you.

300
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,497
- I was wondering--
- Yeah,

301
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:07,208
I did something stupid.

302
00:18:08,443 --> 00:18:09,585
What?

303
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:14,721
I wanted to have a word with her,

304
00:18:14,741 --> 00:18:16,639
you know, tell her to leave you alone,
but I just...

305
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:18,558
- Oh, my--
- I just kind of lost it.

306
00:18:18,578 --> 00:18:20,596
- Jesus, Ian!
- Sorry.

307
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:23,730
We don't need you
fighting our battles, okay?

308
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,643
You're only gonna make it worse.

309
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:28,187
Please, you can't rile her.

310
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,773
- Sorry.
- Hey, honey.

311
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:33,615
Did you get a bit of lunch or...

312
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:34,991
No.

313
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:39,490
There's nothing to eat in this house
except rice cakes and tomatoes.

314
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:42,618
Blame Becka, she's the food Hoover.

315
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:45,460
I'll get you some nosebag on the way.

316
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,170
Do you have all your gear?

317
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:51,085
And look, Bla, I don't want you going over
to Angelica's after school anymore.

318
00:18:51,653 --> 00:18:52,884
I'll do what I want.

319
00:18:52,904 --> 00:18:56,262
No, you will not do what you want,
you'll come straight home.

320
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:57,550
Calm down.

321
00:18:57,951 --> 00:18:59,302
You look insane.

322
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:08,316
I wanna say she's being
a mean little bitch, but I can't.

323
00:19:08,336 --> 00:19:10,396
You can, yeah.

324
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:15,193
She's so mean.

325
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,530
And for the record, you don't look insane.

326
00:19:21,182 --> 00:19:22,283
You look lovely.

327
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:27,961
Okay.

328
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:29,754
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

329
00:19:29,774 --> 00:19:32,001
Wait, what? Why?

330
00:19:34,654 --> 00:19:35,755
Ian?

331
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:41,266
All right, you didn't hear it from me,

332
00:19:41,286 --> 00:19:43,685
but they're throwing
a surprise party for you.

333
00:19:43,705 --> 00:19:47,105
And just so you'll really hate it,
it's fancy dress.

334
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,309
Wha--

335
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:49,978
Kill me now.

336
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:21,634
Party cups.

337
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,476
Hi, Urs.

338
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:27,015
Yeah, we're just finishing up.

339
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,600
You want a what?

340
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,023
We've got to get an urn.

341
00:20:40,762 --> 00:20:42,702
Well, it says Biscotti.

342
00:20:42,722 --> 00:20:45,199
We'll tell her Grace loved Biscotti.

343
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:51,711
What's going on with you
and the baby stuff?

344
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:53,463
We're trying again.

345
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:56,044
I convinced Nora
that I was fully on board.

346
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:59,547
Angelica did us a favor
when she lobbed that grenade.

347
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:02,300
It's all so hard though.

348
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,015
It seems unfair.

349
00:21:04,035 --> 00:21:06,888
Straight couples get families
when they don't even want them.

350
00:21:09,165 --> 00:21:10,516
I'll give you my eggs if you like.

351
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:14,812
Nah, you're all right.

352
00:21:15,296 --> 00:21:18,316
Nora's pretty adamant
she wanted a smart donor.

353
00:21:27,016 --> 00:21:29,702
Get off me, you needy leech.

354
00:21:37,694 --> 00:21:39,462
I asked for a short, Fergal.

355
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:41,881
Well, I got you a pint, Gerard.

356
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,721
You're welcome.

357
00:21:43,741 --> 00:21:47,929
You still only have me for ten minutes
gratis and then you're on the clock.

358
00:21:50,582 --> 00:21:53,231
My ex is trying
to take my daughter to Australia,

359
00:21:53,251 --> 00:21:54,894
who doesn't even want to go.

360
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:56,729
How do I keep her here?

361
00:21:57,297 --> 00:21:59,988
Do you really want to make her choose
between her mother and father?

362
00:22:00,008 --> 00:22:03,199
So what? You--
I'm just supposed to roll over?

363
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:05,994
She's got the house, the car--

364
00:22:06,014 --> 00:22:08,746
which her new fella's
been driving around in, by the way,

365
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:11,869
15 miles an hour, geriatric prick--

366
00:22:12,812 --> 00:22:14,836
she's not taking my daughter too.

367
00:22:14,856 --> 00:22:16,129
I want you to stop her.

368
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:18,293
Are you gonna put your money
where your mouth is, Fergal?

369
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:22,088
Once they're in Australia, it would be
almost impossible to get her back.

370
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:25,054
You want to do this now,
you're gonna need funds.

371
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:26,342
I'm good for it.

372
00:22:41,966 --> 00:22:43,443
I'm 50.

373
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:46,529
I'm 50.

374
00:23:05,782 --> 00:23:08,223
- There? Yeah? You sure? Okay.
- Yeah. Perfect. Yeah. It's spot on.

375
00:23:08,243 --> 00:23:10,266
One, two. One, two.

376
00:23:10,286 --> 00:23:12,769
I can't get this thing to work.
We've been trying to work it all day.

377
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:14,223
One, two. One, two.

378
00:23:14,832 --> 00:23:16,231
I don't even know if that's working.

379
00:23:16,251 --> 00:23:17,435
That's amazing.

380
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:20,605
Surprise.

381
00:23:21,214 --> 00:23:22,403
Surprise!

382
00:23:22,423 --> 00:23:24,692
Oh, no! Surprise!

383
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:27,867
...birthday.

384
00:23:27,887 --> 00:23:28,826
You were tipped off.

385
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:31,371
- You look like a hooker.
- Hey.

386
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:32,747
It looks amazing.

387
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:34,869
Big surprise, hey?

388
00:23:45,238 --> 00:23:46,881
She's somewhere over here, I think.

389
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,511
- Roger.
- Becka let me in.

390
00:23:51,953 --> 00:23:53,763
Didn't realize it was a party.

391
00:23:54,247 --> 00:23:56,307
Yeah. Well, neither did I.

392
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:58,977
See you had your hair done. Very nice.

393
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:01,646
A few oysters for ya.

394
00:24:02,213 --> 00:24:05,149
Oh, Roger.

395
00:24:05,675 --> 00:24:08,032
Maybe I could come round some night
when you're not busy.

396
00:24:08,052 --> 00:24:09,320
Take you out somewhere.

397
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,995
Sorry?

398
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:14,993
Help each other
through the loss like Ian and Grace did.

399
00:24:17,854 --> 00:24:19,669
Are-- You're asking me out?

400
00:24:19,689 --> 00:24:22,375
Or in. We could stay in.

401
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:24,841
It's fine if it's a no.

402
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:27,588
Yeah, it's a no.
But do you wanna stay and join us?

403
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,721
No, I don't want to intrude.

404
00:24:29,741 --> 00:24:31,342
There's karaoke.

405
00:24:34,996 --> 00:24:40,023
<i>His pretty colored skin
Had been all frosted with the dew</i>

406
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:41,399
<i>"Oh well," she cried</i>

407
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:44,444
<i>"I'll take you in
And I'll take care of you"</i>

408
00:24:44,464 --> 00:24:45,361
Everyone.

409
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:48,489
<i>"Take me in, oh, tender woman</i>

410
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:51,242
<i>Take me in, for heaven's sake</i>

411
00:24:51,262 --> 00:24:55,366
<i>Take me in, oh, tender woman"</i>

412
00:24:58,186 --> 00:24:59,709
Nice.

413
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:01,711
<i>She wrapped him up all cozy...</i>

414
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:03,713
- You having a good time?
- Yeah.

415
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:05,632
Better than I thought, but...

416
00:25:05,652 --> 00:25:06,716
<i>And laid him by the fireside</i>

417
00:25:06,736 --> 00:25:08,134
...you know.

418
00:25:08,154 --> 00:25:09,385
<i>With some honey...</i>

419
00:25:09,405 --> 00:25:10,757
I know.

420
00:25:12,116 --> 00:25:13,139
Go Roger!

421
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:14,474
She'd have loved this.

422
00:25:14,494 --> 00:25:18,770
<i>...Had been revived
"Oh, take me in, oh, tender woman</i>

423
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,189
- <i>Take me in</i>
- <i>For heavens sake</i>

424
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:24,317
<i>Take me in, oh, tender..."</i>

425
00:25:24,337 --> 00:25:25,897
Gotta put the dishwasher on.

426
00:25:27,048 --> 00:25:30,240
<i>"Take me in, oh, tender woman</i>

427
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,653
<i>Take me..."</i>

428
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:56,552
Roger asked me out tonight.

429
00:25:58,454 --> 00:25:59,394
Wow.

430
00:25:59,414 --> 00:26:01,813
Think of those liquid hips.

431
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,815
He's a catch for someone.

432
00:26:03,835 --> 00:26:07,527
Well, he asked me out first,
so that makes you sloppy seconds.

433
00:26:07,547 --> 00:26:09,946
Well, Grace first really.

434
00:26:09,966 --> 00:26:12,610
So, you know, sloppy thirds.

435
00:26:14,512 --> 00:26:16,489
I missed her so much tonight.

436
00:26:17,307 --> 00:26:18,574
I missed her laugh.

437
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:20,368
Yeah.

438
00:26:25,231 --> 00:26:26,457
She loved this.

439
00:26:28,026 --> 00:26:29,711
No.

440
00:26:31,446 --> 00:26:34,465
<i>Doo-be da, doo-be da</i>

441
00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:38,219
<i>Doo-be da, doo-be da</i>

442
00:26:38,912 --> 00:26:41,895
<i>Doo-be da, doo-be da</i>

443
00:26:41,915 --> 00:26:42,812
Eva.

444
00:26:42,832 --> 00:26:46,436
<i>Doo-be da</i>

445
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:53,323
<i>Hold onto love</i>

446
00:26:53,343 --> 00:26:57,160
<i>That is what I do</i>

447
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,742
<i>Now that I've found you</i>

448
00:27:02,894 --> 00:27:08,671
<i>And from above</i>

449
00:27:08,691 --> 00:27:11,377
<i>Everything's stinking</i>

450
00:27:11,986 --> 00:27:13,551
<i>They're not around you</i>

451
00:27:13,571 --> 00:27:15,715
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

452
00:27:16,282 --> 00:27:17,717
Are you kidding me?

453
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:21,262
Did you know?

454
00:27:21,913 --> 00:27:24,729
Not long. Just a couple of days.

455
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:27,232
- Oh, my God. Oh. Sorry.
- Careful. My boobs.

456
00:27:27,252 --> 00:27:30,527
Sorry, but your world's going to implode
and explode in one glorious--

457
00:27:30,547 --> 00:27:34,359
- I don't know what I'm gonna do yet.
- Okay.

458
00:27:36,886 --> 00:27:38,029
Sorry.

459
00:27:38,596 --> 00:27:39,697
It's okay.

460
00:27:47,564 --> 00:27:54,111
<i>But I miss you when you're gone</i>

461
00:27:54,112 --> 00:28:00,242
<i>That is what I do</i>

462
00:28:00,243 --> 00:28:02,809
<i>Hey, baby</i>

463
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:09,835
<i>And it's going to carry on</i>

464
00:28:09,836 --> 00:28:15,405
<i>That is what I knew</i>

465
00:28:15,425 --> 00:28:18,366
<i>Hey, baby</i>

466
00:28:18,386 --> 00:28:21,864
<i>Doo-be da, doo-be da</i>

467
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,410
<i>Doo-be da, doo-be da</i>

468
00:28:26,185 --> 00:28:27,620
<i>Doo-be da</i>

469
00:28:29,689 --> 00:28:31,708
- We've got the Biscotti?
- Yes.

470
00:28:32,901 --> 00:28:35,800
Come on.
She'll hold every minute against us.

471
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,177
Let her.

472
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:38,887
Today is about keeping her sweet.

473
00:28:38,907 --> 00:28:40,305
Don't rile her.

474
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:42,093
And don't mention the money, right?

475
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,767
What's with the bag?

476
00:28:44,787 --> 00:28:46,728
It's my wet weather gear.

477
00:28:46,748 --> 00:28:49,392
Geez. Sort yourself out, why don't you?

478
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:51,227
Which boat is it?

479
00:28:58,676 --> 00:29:00,491
Who'd you borrow that off?

480
00:29:00,511 --> 00:29:01,946
Michael Flatley?

481
00:29:03,431 --> 00:29:05,533
I'd never sleep with Michael Flatley.

482
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,916
Where the hell is she?

483
00:29:21,115 --> 00:29:22,425
Bla? Are you awake?

484
00:29:23,243 --> 00:29:24,677
I made you granola.

485
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,472
I didn't make it. I put it in a bowl.

486
00:29:27,914 --> 00:29:29,974
Can I come in? I'm coming in.

487
00:29:35,463 --> 00:29:36,648
Bla?

488
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,941
Blanaid?

489
00:29:41,427 --> 00:29:42,570
Blanaid?

490
00:30:03,408 --> 00:30:05,932
Right. Now,
there is a sight for sore eyes.

491
00:30:05,952 --> 00:30:07,220
Hi.

492
00:30:08,121 --> 00:30:10,682
Just park your bike round the back there.

493
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:34,127
Hey, I was just thinking about you.

494
00:30:34,147 --> 00:30:37,338
Ian, is Bla with you?

495
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:38,590
<i>No. Is she not at school?</i>

496
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,758
<i>No, I gave her the day off.</i>

497
00:30:40,778 --> 00:30:41,926
- Why?
- Why?

498
00:30:41,946 --> 00:30:45,305
Because her bloody mam just died.

499
00:30:45,325 --> 00:30:46,634
Sorry.

500
00:30:47,202 --> 00:30:48,725
<i>When did you last see her?</i>

501
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:50,638
Well-- Oh, shit. Last night.

502
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:57,192
- Think she's with Angelica?
- Yeah, but that's where my head went.

503
00:30:57,212 --> 00:30:58,693
Look, I gotta go.

504
00:30:58,713 --> 00:31:00,523
I'll ca-- I'll talk to you.

505
00:31:05,136 --> 00:31:06,618
Urs, is Angelica there yet?

506
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:08,828
<i>'Cause Bla's not here.
She's not answering her phone.</i>

507
00:31:08,848 --> 00:31:10,538
- Not yet. No.
- Oh, my God.

508
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:12,243
Do you-- You don't think that she's--

509
00:31:13,978 --> 00:31:15,752
Oh, shit. Hang on.

510
00:31:15,772 --> 00:31:18,755
<i>Eva? I can't get a proper signal out here.</i>

511
00:31:18,775 --> 00:31:21,424
Well, you don't think
that this whole ashes thing

512
00:31:21,444 --> 00:31:23,551
is all a ruse or something, do you?

513
00:31:23,571 --> 00:31:25,470
Like, she's taken her or... Fuck.

514
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,674
<i>Hello?</i>

515
00:31:27,742 --> 00:31:30,600
- Yeah? Yeah.
- Eva Garvey?

516
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,187
My name's Tina. I'm from social services.
I've been trying your phone.

517
00:31:34,207 --> 00:31:36,184
<i>I can't hear you. I can't--</i>

518
00:31:37,126 --> 00:31:38,645
I'll call you back, Urs.

519
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:41,397
- Social services?
- Yeah.

520
00:31:42,257 --> 00:31:44,901
I'm so-- Nearly flashed you there.

521
00:31:45,927 --> 00:31:47,612
Can I come in? Have a chat?

522
00:31:48,012 --> 00:31:50,954
Can I just ask-- Did someone call you or...

523
00:31:50,974 --> 00:31:53,451
This is just a standard welfare check.

524
00:31:55,395 --> 00:31:57,872
Can I-- Sorry, it was--

525
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:01,548
We had a party last night.
Well, not a party.

526
00:32:01,568 --> 00:32:04,050
More like a family get-together.

527
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,052
A soiree. It's my birthday.

528
00:32:06,072 --> 00:32:08,429
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you. Fifty.

529
00:32:08,449 --> 00:32:10,468
But I'm a young 50.

530
00:32:11,286 --> 00:32:13,096
That's my sisters'.

531
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:16,437
That-- I don't even drink anymore.
Thank God.

532
00:32:16,457 --> 00:32:19,143
Not that it was ever a problem.

533
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:21,354
Do you mind?

534
00:32:22,046 --> 00:32:23,528
Yeah. Sure.

535
00:32:23,548 --> 00:32:25,608
That's just guest wine.

536
00:32:28,553 --> 00:32:30,989
What time is Blanaid home?

537
00:32:36,853 --> 00:32:39,878
{\an8}Ian Reilly's place was chaotic.
I'm telling you, sir.

538
00:32:39,898 --> 00:32:41,129
He was looking for that money.

539
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:42,505
I just have a-- kind of a f--

540
00:32:42,525 --> 00:32:46,838
If you say the word hunch,
gut, or feel in the next sentence...

541
00:32:48,364 --> 00:32:51,306
I just can't buy that
it was a plain old road collision.

542
00:32:51,326 --> 00:32:52,849
I mean, even if we did spook her,

543
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:54,767
she wouldn't run
and leave the daughter behind.

544
00:32:54,787 --> 00:32:58,433
And what about the 20,000 euro?
Where's that?

545
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:01,107
I reckon-- I was thinking

546
00:33:01,127 --> 00:33:04,652
and it's most probably somewhere
in her life, like her house.

547
00:33:04,672 --> 00:33:09,616
My auntie was in an abusive relationship,
and he was a real dirtbag.

548
00:33:09,636 --> 00:33:12,410
Anyway, she would save any money she could

549
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:15,330
and hide it in an old Quality Street tin
behind the shed.

550
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,577
You know, for when she needed to run.

551
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:20,204
Her hen money, that's what she called it.

552
00:33:23,358 --> 00:33:24,667
I'll look into it.

553
00:33:31,491 --> 00:33:33,139
She better not be messing with us.

554
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:35,428
She better not refresh the charges.

555
00:33:37,288 --> 00:33:39,604
Seriously,
which one of your friends owns this?

556
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:40,892
Mikey.

557
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:43,019
Can't remember his last name.

558
00:33:43,628 --> 00:33:45,063
Sounds made-up.

559
00:33:47,215 --> 00:33:48,399
How'd he make his money?

560
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,443
I'm not sure.

561
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,236
Drugs?

562
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:55,156
No, guns.

563
00:34:56,743 --> 00:34:59,642
Can you believe that wagon
called social services on me?

564
00:34:59,662 --> 00:35:02,770
- <i>You don't know that she did.</i>
- Yeah, I know it like I know my name.

565
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,649
Look, let's just find Bla first,
and then we'll deal with her after.

566
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:08,313
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

567
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:12,739
Look, I know you're worried sick,
but just try to stay calm.

568
00:35:12,759 --> 00:35:14,282
<i>I can't.</i>

569
00:35:14,302 --> 00:35:16,070
I'll call you back.

570
00:35:20,892 --> 00:35:22,618
That wagon turn up yet?

571
00:35:23,394 --> 00:35:25,126
I can't find Bla anywhere.

572
00:35:25,146 --> 00:35:27,582
Will you just call me back?

573
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:32,378
Blanaid.

574
00:35:50,922 --> 00:35:52,065
Shit.

575
00:36:04,018 --> 00:36:05,495
Where are ya?

576
00:36:29,711 --> 00:36:31,479
Fuck's sake.

577
00:37:28,436 --> 00:37:31,789
Oy, do any of you know Blanaid Williams?

578
00:37:32,315 --> 00:37:33,833
Is she the fresh orphan?

579
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,462
Yeah. Have you seen her today?

580
00:37:42,951 --> 00:37:44,849
I wanna feel your hair on my balls.

581
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:45,934
Oh, God.

582
00:37:45,954 --> 00:37:47,560
- <i>Any joy?</i>
- No, I can't--

583
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,771
I can't see her anywhere.
I'm gonna go to the cop shop.

584
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:52,268
Wait, look, it's too early for that, Eva.

585
00:37:53,211 --> 00:37:55,151
She could be anywhere.
She might be down at the seafront.

586
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:56,402
She's not, okay?

587
00:37:56,422 --> 00:37:58,404
She's not anywhere and I'm freaking out.

588
00:37:58,424 --> 00:38:01,449
<i>Angelica's done something to her
and I don't know what else to do.</i>

589
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:04,781
So just call me if you hear anything.

590
00:38:14,858 --> 00:38:16,167
There she is.

591
00:38:18,111 --> 00:38:19,837
Permission to come aboard.

592
00:38:29,747 --> 00:38:31,683
This is gonna be a long day.

593
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:34,060
Christ.

594
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:40,530
Look, we don't have time for this, okay?
She's only 14 years old.

595
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,867
- She just lost her mam. I need someone--
- I'll take this, Sergeant.

596
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:47,365
Ms. Garvey, come with me.

597
00:38:48,558 --> 00:38:49,659
This way.

598
00:39:02,363 --> 00:39:04,048
Check out Kate Winslet.

599
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:11,352
I'm scared she's gonna
make us pray together.

600
00:39:11,372 --> 00:39:12,562
Grow a fanny, Urs.

601
00:39:12,582 --> 00:39:14,392
Yeah, grow a fanny, Urs.

602
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:22,608
Should be here.

603
00:39:25,094 --> 00:39:28,323
I feel Grace here.

604
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:45,131
Merciful God...

605
00:39:47,909 --> 00:39:51,601
may Grace be relieved
of the burden of shame

606
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:53,848
she carried here on Earth.

607
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:59,062
Although she was betrayed
by those she loved...

608
00:40:01,256 --> 00:40:04,776
she remained gracious till the end.

609
00:40:06,636 --> 00:40:09,906
Oh, we pray too for beloved Blanaid,

610
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,785
may she find happiness.

611
00:40:16,437 --> 00:40:19,999
Would you like to say a word?

612
00:40:26,197 --> 00:40:27,548
Grace...

613
00:40:31,452 --> 00:40:33,680
fly free as a seagull.

614
00:40:35,582 --> 00:40:36,975
No,

615
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:41,067
fly close to try and help us

616
00:40:41,087 --> 00:40:45,441
make sense of a life without you.

617
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,153
We love you so much.

618
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:52,532
Amen.

619
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,911
Amen.

620
00:41:04,777 --> 00:41:06,129
Fuck's sake.

621
00:41:08,531 --> 00:41:10,305
Would you like to scatter a few?

622
00:41:10,325 --> 00:41:12,051
No, you knock yourself out.

623
00:41:15,997 --> 00:41:17,557
Jesus Christ.

624
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:19,183
Right, let's just go home.

625
00:41:26,007 --> 00:41:27,739
Why do we need to talk about it?

626
00:41:27,759 --> 00:41:30,325
We need Guards out there
looking for her now.

627
00:41:30,345 --> 00:41:33,244
Eva, the wheels are in motion,
literally, okay?

628
00:41:33,264 --> 00:41:34,704
The cars are out there.

629
00:41:34,724 --> 00:41:37,165
Anything we can be doing, we are doing.

630
00:41:37,185 --> 00:41:40,001
- Geez, you don't understand.
- I've got a 12-year-old at home myself.

631
00:41:40,021 --> 00:41:42,670
- I know how tricky they can be.
- No, it's not about tricky, okay?

632
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,797
It's the-- It's other stuff.

633
00:41:44,817 --> 00:41:48,176
It's people I can't trust
that are around her.

634
00:41:48,196 --> 00:41:49,380
You mean Ian Reilly?

635
00:41:50,406 --> 00:41:51,471
What?

636
00:41:51,491 --> 00:41:55,094
No, I mean Angelica Collins.

637
00:42:01,584 --> 00:42:03,519
I mean, thank you for today.

638
00:42:05,421 --> 00:42:06,945
It was very healing, wasn't it?

639
00:42:06,965 --> 00:42:09,531
Oh, yeah, praise the Lord.

640
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:12,867
I'm just wondering now whether I shouldn't
have brought my wee Blanaid along.

641
00:42:12,887 --> 00:42:15,370
- And she's not your wee Blanaid.
- She's our niece.

642
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,496
We've got her.

643
00:42:16,516 --> 00:42:18,826
And yet it was to me
she came this morning.

644
00:42:19,352 --> 00:42:20,662
She's with you?

645
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,290
You had Eva worried.

646
00:42:24,691 --> 00:42:27,257
Grace wouldn't want you
anywhere near Blanaid.

647
00:42:27,277 --> 00:42:29,420
Brainwashing her with your blood--

648
00:42:30,822 --> 00:42:32,882
You just need to stay away from her, okay?

649
00:42:33,575 --> 00:42:34,842
She came to me.

650
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:37,934
Angelica, she was stalking Grace, okay?

651
00:42:37,954 --> 00:42:40,228
She's zoned in on Blanaid now.

652
00:42:40,248 --> 00:42:43,648
She's got this room in her house
that she's all done up for her.

653
00:42:43,668 --> 00:42:46,943
It's just-- Something terrible's
gonna happen. I can feel it.

654
00:42:46,963 --> 00:42:47,861
Like what?

655
00:42:47,881 --> 00:42:49,487
She shouldn't be allowed around her.

656
00:42:49,507 --> 00:42:51,322
I mean, are you even investigating her?

657
00:42:51,342 --> 00:42:53,741
Well, I'm not being smart, but for what?

658
00:42:53,761 --> 00:42:55,159
For being too intense?

659
00:42:55,179 --> 00:42:57,657
No, for driving my sister to her death.

660
00:42:58,516 --> 00:43:00,874
Are you saying you think
Angelica drove Grace off the road?

661
00:43:00,894 --> 00:43:05,253
I'm not saying she literally drove her,
but she was wrangling money off her.

662
00:43:05,273 --> 00:43:07,166
I mean, have you even found it yet?

663
00:43:08,276 --> 00:43:11,462
We asked you about the money
and what it was for.

664
00:43:13,656 --> 00:43:16,092
Oh, shit. Ian.

665
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:19,767
Oh, thank God.

666
00:43:19,787 --> 00:43:23,182
Oh, Jesus Christ. Okay.

667
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:25,518
Will you put her on to me?

668
00:43:26,753 --> 00:43:28,521
Well, where the hell was she?

669
00:43:31,007 --> 00:43:33,276
Okay. I'll see you at home.

670
00:43:40,892 --> 00:43:42,373
He found her.

671
00:43:42,393 --> 00:43:45,793
He-- Yeah, sorry about all the

672
00:43:45,813 --> 00:43:48,671
hysterical-- I was panicked, I think.

673
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:50,632
So, yeah, sorry. Forget all that.

674
00:43:50,652 --> 00:43:52,253
Forget Angelica?

675
00:43:53,029 --> 00:43:55,929
Yeah.
I think I was just crazed with panic and--

676
00:43:55,949 --> 00:43:59,224
You know, it's my sister's daughter
and I lost her,

677
00:43:59,244 --> 00:44:01,638
and also just hormones and--

678
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:06,142
But thank you for your time,
and sorry again.

679
00:44:06,876 --> 00:44:08,269
Best wishes.

680
00:44:15,802 --> 00:44:17,028
You ready?

681
00:44:17,971 --> 00:44:20,198
Come on. Play nice.

682
00:44:20,682 --> 00:44:22,116
Blanaid.

683
00:44:23,226 --> 00:44:26,579
Where were you?

684
00:44:27,522 --> 00:44:28,878
Were you with her?

685
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:31,673
Bla, I need to know where you are!

686
00:44:31,693 --> 00:44:36,386
So you chase around town,
asking questions, making a show of me?

687
00:44:36,406 --> 00:44:38,263
Yeah, because I was worried about you.

688
00:44:38,283 --> 00:44:41,052
Why? You're not my mam.

689
00:44:42,245 --> 00:44:43,518
You're no one's mam.

690
00:44:43,538 --> 00:44:45,139
Bla!

691
00:44:49,836 --> 00:44:52,735
Look, all she did was go shopping
with some money Angelica gave her.

692
00:44:52,755 --> 00:44:55,363
- She's embarrassed by the fuss.
- I don't care.

693
00:44:55,383 --> 00:44:59,117
I care that she is sneaking around
behind our backs with her.

694
00:44:59,137 --> 00:45:01,119
Fine, but you overreacted.

695
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:02,579
I mean, you all do it, all the Garveys.

696
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,789
- There's always bloody drama.
- How is this my fault now?

697
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:06,541
I'm not saying it's your fault.

698
00:45:06,561 --> 00:45:08,251
- I'm just saying that you ne--
- It's too hard.

699
00:45:08,271 --> 00:45:09,872
It's too hard. I can't do it.

700
00:45:10,899 --> 00:45:12,500
I can't do it.

701
00:45:12,984 --> 00:45:14,174
- Eva.
- I ca--

702
00:45:14,194 --> 00:45:17,802
Eva, come here. Come. I'm sorry.

703
00:45:17,822 --> 00:45:19,554
I'm sorry.

704
00:45:19,574 --> 00:45:21,681
Yeah? I'm sorry. Look at me.

705
00:45:21,701 --> 00:45:23,094
I'm sorry.

706
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:26,180
Hey.

707
00:45:47,393 --> 00:45:48,494
Sorry.

708
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:59,260
Bibi, don't. Don't rise to her.

709
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,803
Do you know Grace was pro-choice?

710
00:46:00,823 --> 00:46:02,514
Voted yes for marriage equality?

711
00:46:02,534 --> 00:46:04,385
That's what she told you.

712
00:46:04,953 --> 00:46:08,473
That girl needs someone to guide her.

713
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:13,942
And Eva is too busy making a play
for Grace's Ian to care about her.

714
00:46:13,962 --> 00:46:16,778
- You're deluded.
- Well, she did it before. Why not again?

715
00:46:16,798 --> 00:46:18,655
What the hell do you mean
she did it before?

716
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:20,323
She made a play for John Paul.

717
00:46:20,343 --> 00:46:22,158
She did not make a play for JP.

718
00:46:22,178 --> 00:46:23,404
He raped her.

719
00:46:24,472 --> 00:46:25,870
He raped his wife's sister.

720
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:28,414
That is a very convenient tale.

721
00:46:28,434 --> 00:46:29,661
Will you hold this a sec?

722
00:46:30,228 --> 00:46:31,793
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- No, Bibi!

723
00:46:31,813 --> 00:46:33,873
Calm down!

724
00:46:34,649 --> 00:46:37,669
Eva is playing a player.

725
00:46:38,111 --> 00:46:40,802
I know a snake in the grass
when I see one,

726
00:46:40,822 --> 00:46:43,680
that man is not to be trusted.

727
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,098
What are you talking about?

728
00:46:45,118 --> 00:46:46,636
I'm talking about--

729
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:56,985
What do we do?

730
00:46:57,005 --> 00:46:59,779
Ursula, point to where she went over.

731
00:46:59,799 --> 00:47:01,776
Do not take your eyes off that spot.

732
00:47:02,802 --> 00:47:05,118
- Where'd she go?
- Becka, call for help.

733
00:47:05,138 --> 00:47:06,703
I can't see her.

734
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:10,164
Becka, downstairs! Now! Right now!

735
00:47:10,184 --> 00:47:12,787
Call the coast guard from downstairs!

736
00:47:13,271 --> 00:47:15,456
Ursula, keep your eyes on the water!

737
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:17,709
Hello?

738
00:47:18,151 --> 00:47:20,216
- Hello? Oh, please.
- Oh, God.

739
00:47:20,236 --> 00:47:21,754
What the hell just happened?

740
00:47:23,198 --> 00:47:26,014
- Hello? Crap.
- Becka, look for a flare!

741
00:47:26,034 --> 00:47:28,094
It'll be in a red box!

742
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:34,647
Oh, fuck you, Mikey.

743
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:36,561
- Christ's sake.
- Shit.

744
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:38,771
Bibi, I see her.

745
00:47:40,048 --> 00:47:42,739
- Bibi, she's right there.
- Where?

746
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:44,324
- Okay.
- Go! Go straight back!

747
00:47:44,344 --> 00:47:46,993
- It's not a fucking Volvo, Becka!
- Go back!

748
00:47:47,013 --> 00:47:48,119
She's right there!

749
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:50,158
We're going to lose her.

750
00:47:52,143 --> 00:47:54,500
Becka, no! Absolutely not!

751
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,753
You're pregnant, you stupid bitch!

752
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:59,709
- Becka! Come back!
- No, Becka!

753
00:48:08,243 --> 00:48:09,469
Bibi, do something!

754
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:17,352
Angelica!

755
00:48:21,631 --> 00:48:22,904
Becka!

756
00:48:22,924 --> 00:48:24,692
Angelica!

757
00:48:26,302 --> 00:48:27,737
Oh, shit!

758
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,533
It's not her.

759
00:48:32,934 --> 00:48:34,827
It's not her!

760
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:44,212
Angelica!

761
00:48:47,949 --> 00:48:50,468
Fuck that wagon!
