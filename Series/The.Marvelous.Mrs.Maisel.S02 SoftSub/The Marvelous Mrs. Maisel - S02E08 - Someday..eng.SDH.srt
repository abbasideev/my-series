"Walk a mile in a man's shoes"?

00:00:09,204 --> 00:00:10,538
I mean, think about that.

00:00:10,622 --> 00:00:12,456
The perspective that gives you.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,458
Well, I took it to heart, put on
a pair of my husband's shoes,

6
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:17,877
and, my God, were they comfortable.

7
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:20,213
I get it now, why men rule the world

8
00:00:20,297 --> 00:00:21,548

9
00:00:21,632 --> 00:00:23,549
They can walk faster,

10
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:25,217
and their backs don't hurt.

11
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:26,885
I'm divorcing my husband,

12
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:29,638
but I am keeping the fucking shoes.

13
00:00:29,722 --> 00:00:31,472
Thank you, everybody.

I'm on the road the next few days,

Hey, thanks.

I can never tell if they're
talking about the boobs

-Hi there.

Day three, Philly.

Oh. Okay.
I mean, I typed it up all fancy.

Even fixed my "S" key.

-No, no, no, let me see it.

-Let me see it.

-You spelled "itinerary" wrong.
-Damn.

It's impressive.

50
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,042
Just remember the most important part:

51
00:01:49,126 --> 00:01:50,375
day one, tomorrow,

52
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:52,461
depart New York City 1:30 p.m. sharp.

53
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,379
-Got it?
-I will not be late.

Do what? What is this?

57
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:04,764
The plates for you to switch on the car.

58
00:02:04,848 --> 00:02:06,182
Why are we switching
the plates on the car?

59
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:08,058
Well, it… it's technically stolen.

60
00:02:08,142 --> 00:02:09,309
There's nothing technical about it.

61
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:10,685
It's fucking stolen.

62
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:12,771
I like Utah. They'll think you're Mormon

63
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:14,981
and leave you alone.
I mean, no one talks to Mormons

64
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:16,232
unless they have to.

65
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:17,817

-It is.

You stole your mother's car?

Hey, she stole my childhood.
I think we're even.

68
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:23,239
What if we're pulled over
and they run our plates?

00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:25,156
-I'll handle it.
-Great plan.

Fine. Have no part of it.

Wyoming's full of cowboys
and tough hombres,

78
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,047
and cops are less likely to pull us over

79
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:43,631
'cause they won't want to mess with us.

80
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:45,758
Plus, it's got a horse,
and I like the horse.

00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:46,968

00:38:08,262 --> 00:38:10,138
Lighten up.
We're in the comedy business, man.

1023
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:11,723
-Let her out.
-Sheesh.

1024
00:38:11,807 --> 00:38:13,809
No sense of humor.

1025
00:38:22,316 --> 00:38:24,276
-JOEL: Are you all right?
-Yeah.

1026
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,569
-Did he do that?
-What? This?

1027
00:38:26,653 --> 00:38:29,155
-Oh, no. The bed ate me. See…
-I don't want to know.

1028
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,448
Now pay them.

1029
00:38:30,532 --> 00:38:32,199
-She was late.
-Ten minutes.

1030
00:38:32,283 --> 00:38:33,743
Doesn't matter. Pay her what you owe her.

1031
00:38:33,827 --> 00:38:35,869
So you're her manager.

1032
00:38:35,953 --> 00:38:37,245
I'm her manager, Ricky. You know that.

1033
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:38,955
-So who are you?
-JOEL: What's it matter?

1034
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:40,373
I like to know who I'm talking to.

1035
00:38:40,457 --> 00:38:41,416
-JOEL: I'm her husband.
-Her husband?

1036
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,418
Well, why the fuck don't you keep her…

1037
00:38:43,502 --> 00:38:44,668
MIDGE: Joel.

1038

Wherever that sentence was going,

1039
00:38:46,003 --> 00:38:47,129
it was gonna end up like that anyway.

1040
00:38:47,213 --> 00:38:48,547
A whole new light, pal.

1041
00:38:48,631 --> 00:38:49,673
Now pay her what you owe her.

1042
00:38:49,757 --> 00:38:51,341
Fine.

1043
00:38:51,425 --> 00:38:53,635
You're lucky I don't sue you.

1044
00:38:55,554 --> 00:38:57,930
MAN: Hey, your nose is bleeding.

1045
00:38:58,014 --> 00:38:59,432
I miss something here?

1046
00:38:59,516 --> 00:39:00,808
-You the owner?
-Yeah.

1047
00:39:00,892 --> 00:39:02,517
You let guys like that run your business?

1048
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:04,978
-He's my sister's kid.
-Family's nice.

1049
00:39:05,062 --> 00:39:06,563
Doesn't mean he can run your business.

1050
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:09,232
Get some people working
for you who respect the talent.

1051
00:39:09,316 --> 00:39:11,358
That's talent.

1052
00:39:11,442 --> 00:39:13,611
She could put this shithole
on the map someday.

1053
00:39:13,695 --> 00:39:15,488
Wake the fuck up.

1054
00:39:18,575 --> 00:39:21,618
Yeah, and you also have to
buy your janitor a new plunger.

The one in there is old
and sad and lost its suction.

1056
00:39:25,372 --> 00:39:27,248
Sure.

1057
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:29,124
-Is it all there?
-Yup.

1058
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:32,002
Nice doing business with you.

1059
00:39:32,086 --> 00:39:34,755
MIDGE: You got to teach
me how to do that one day.

1060
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:44,971
I'm gonna grab a cab home.

1061
00:39:45,055 --> 00:39:46,640
You want me to drop you?

1062
00:39:46,724 --> 00:39:49,142
No. I started this road trip with Susie

1063
00:39:49,226 --> 00:39:50,769
and I kind of want to finish it with her.

1064
00:39:50,853 --> 00:39:52,854
Thank you, Joel.

1065
00:39:52,938 --> 00:39:54,647
Any time.

1066
00:40:00,737 --> 00:40:02,529
You didn't have to call him.

1067
00:40:02,613 --> 00:40:06,449
Unfortunately, sometimes to
make things work in a man's world,

1068
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:08,409
you need a man.

1069
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:09,953
That's just the way it is, Susie.

1070
00:40:10,037 --> 00:40:11,787
I would have found a
way to take care of it.

1071
00:40:11,871 --> 00:40:14,081
You may be some kind of
damsel in distress, but I'm not.

1072
00:40:14,165 --> 00:40:17,168
No, you were a damsel in di-closet.

1073
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,462
Someday.

1074
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:24,132
Yeah. Someday.

1075
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:25,716
Your commission.

1076
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,636
Thanks.

1077
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:31,805
You're counting it? Really?

1078
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:33,724
Force of habit.

1079

How was Pennsylvania?

1082
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,500
-Mama, what happened?
-What happened?

1083
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:05,751
There was a baby shower.

1084
00:41:05,835 --> 00:41:07,461
Did you forget again?

1085
00:41:07,545 --> 00:41:09,463
Should we have you
checked out by a doctor?

1086
00:41:09,547 --> 00:41:12,049
But it was yesterday.

1087
