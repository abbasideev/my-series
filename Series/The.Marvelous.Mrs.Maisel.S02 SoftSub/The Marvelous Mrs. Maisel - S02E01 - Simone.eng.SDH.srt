-What?!

1206
00:49:18,823 --> 00:49:20,407
I want to talk about our future.

1207
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:21,074

1208

we can work this out.

[SIGHS] Midge…

1210
00:49:24,077 --> 00:49:25,328
-We have children.
-Yes.

1211
00:49:25,412 --> 00:49:26,704
We will have to see each other forever.

1212
00:49:26,788 --> 00:49:28,039
-Yes.
-Until we are dead.

1213
00:49:28,123 --> 00:49:29,957
-Yes.
-And then for four to six months after.

1214
00:49:30,041 --> 00:49:31,959
Okay, apparently you
know something I don't.

1215
00:49:32,043 --> 00:49:34,169
So we are never gonna be
fully out of each other's lives.

1216
00:49:34,253 --> 00:49:36,296
-I know that.
-So, if we can't ever leave,

1217
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,756
then let's figure out how to stay.

1218
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,008
-Midge, come on.
-We were on a path.

1219
00:49:40,092 --> 00:49:42,386
We were heading somewhere.
We were almost there.

1220
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:44,637
-I know.
-It was just that night at the club.

-It happened.
-But… I don't understand.

I don't understand
why we can't work it out.

1224
00:49:52,604 --> 00:49:53,771
There has to be a way.

1225

-There's not.
-Don't say that.

1226

I love you, Joel.

So deeply in love with you.

-You're killing me, Midge.
-We can do this.

1230
00:50:06,574 --> 00:50:08,450
We can figure this out.
I can figure this out.

1231
00:50:08,534 --> 00:50:10,160
I can figure anything out. I am amazing.

1232

I know you are, you don't
have to tell me any of this.

1233

and talking about me to
a room full of strangers.

1238
00:50:25,717 --> 00:50:28,803
Talking about my faults,
my mistakes, my failures.

1239
00:50:28,887 --> 00:50:30,262
Yo… You don't understand,
the whole point is

1240
00:50:30,346 --> 00:50:31,972
you go off and talk about your life.

1241
00:50:32,056 --> 00:50:34,808
No, no, no, I do understand.
I understand completely.

1242
00:50:34,892 --> 00:50:37,018
I know you have to talk about your life.

I get it. I just can't live with it.

I wish I could. Maybe another man could,

1248

No.

I don't want you to quit either.

Follow me down the road.
If you're not gonna stop,

1256

I can't be there for it.

Now… why are you in France?

1258
00:51:25,605 --> 00:51:27,647
Long story.
