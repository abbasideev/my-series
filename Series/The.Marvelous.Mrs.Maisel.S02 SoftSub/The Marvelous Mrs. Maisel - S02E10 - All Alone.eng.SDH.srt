uncontrolled giggling.

175
00:07:24,145 --> 00:07:24,648
[LAUGHS]

176
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:27,859
Why? Who knows. That's just Miriam.

177
00:07:27,943 --> 00:07:29,111
I will learn to laugh, sir.

178
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:31,113
You're going to need
a lot of closet space.

179
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:33,657
-I have seen the hats.
-There will be a lot of activity.

180
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:35,284
Things will shift quickly.

181
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:38,328
Your reality, your vacation plans.

182
00:07:38,412 --> 00:07:40,289
And God knows what
those children will be like

183
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:42,207
when they grow up.
I cannot vouch for them.

184
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,293
I will not hold you responsible.

185
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:46,503
It's awfully quick, your courtship.

186
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:49,089
Anything I should know that
will certainly kill her mother?

187
00:07:49,173 --> 00:07:51,591
No. I've just waited a long
time to find the right person,

188
00:07:51,675 --> 00:07:53,176
and now I have. That's all.

189
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,264
ABE: Well, if this is
truly your intention,

190
00:07:57,348 --> 00:07:59,266
in addition to the bank records,

191
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,186
I will need 25 character references.

192
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,063
Are you going to write this down?

193
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:06,523
There's a list. I'll need to know

194
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:08,608
the names and birth dates of your family,

195
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:11,571
how religious you are,
what your hobbies are,

196
00:08:11,655 --> 00:08:14,866
what percentage of time
you spend on such hobbies,

197
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,868
are you a dog or a cat man

198
00:08:16,952 --> 00:08:19,746
very important… your favorite authors.

199
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,790
You see, Benjamin, after the Joel fiasco,

200
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:24,208
I am taking this decision

201
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:25,877
very, very seriously.

202
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,589
You have somewhere else to be?

203
00:08:29,673 --> 00:08:32,175
No. Well, surgery.

204
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:34,302
But never mind. Go on.

205
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:36,387
I'll need to know all
political affiliations,

206
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:37,638
favorite baseball team,

207
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:39,140
favorite radio shows…

208
00:08:39,224 --> 00:08:41,309
Mr. Weissman, could
you excuse me a minute?

209
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:43,144
I need to use the bathroom.

210
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:46,606
Oh. That's something you do?

211
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,649
Yes.

212
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:50,735
All right. If you must.

213
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:57,368
Oh.

214
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,663
-What was that for?
-I just needed to make sure

215
00:09:01,747 --> 00:09:03,540
-you're worth all this.
-I am.

216
00:09:03,624 --> 00:09:05,584
God, this is much harder
than I thought it was gonna be.

217
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:07,878
My father's a complicated man.
But once this is over,

218
00:09:07,962 --> 00:09:09,254
you guys are going to be very close.

219
00:09:09,338 --> 00:09:11,298
-It will never be over.
-It will be.

220
00:09:11,382 --> 00:09:13,133
Four patients have
already died this morning.

221
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:15,677
-A small price to pay.
-I thought we were making progress

222
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:17,304
when we stumbled
onto the Big Bang theory.

223
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:19,348
How do you stumble
onto the Big Bang theory?

224
00:09:19,432 --> 00:09:21,350
And then he asked if I
snack in between meals.

225
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:23,018
-You said no, right?
-I said it depends.

226
00:09:23,102 --> 00:09:25,270
-Oh, dear.
-It does. It's snacking.

227
00:09:25,354 --> 00:09:27,022
There's no plan.
That's what makes it snacking.

228
00:09:27,106 --> 00:09:29,608
Okay, relax. You're doing fine.
And get back in there.

229
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:31,235
If he thinks you're taking
too long in the bathroom,

230
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:32,569
there will be a very thorough physical

231
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:34,655
-in your future.
-Bye.

232
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:38,283
Is this how you look in the morning?

233
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:39,868
Yes, it is.

234
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:42,287
I'll never make it to work on time again.

235
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:44,416
-I'm back.
-ABE: That was quick. Good for you.

236
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,376
Get these downstairs to Accounting now

237
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,169
-or no one gets paid.
-ALL: What?!

238
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:50,422
Everyone's getting paid!
It's an expression.

239
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,049
-Get back to work.
-Mr. Maisel, phone.

240
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,676
The Dutch fabric shipment's gone missing.

241
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,428
How does a truckload
of fabric go missing?

242
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,430
-Joel, are we on for tonight?
-I have the kids tonight.

243
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,390
-I love kids.
-Great. Go have some.

244
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,017
-Never mind, they found it.
-Where?

245
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:05,270
Times Square. The driver had an audition.

246
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,522
Get the shipment, fire the driver.
In that order.

247
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,190
Okay, see, when I gave you

248
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:11,568
that giant amount of money to go away,

249
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,404
-I expected you to go away.
-I don't have time right now, Pop.

250
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,574
I fired you, and you responded
by bringing your children here.

251
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,660
Is that hostile or adorable?
I just can't tell.

252
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:23,246
I'll go. I'm going.
I just have to figure out where.

253
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,747
In the meantime, Mrs. Moskowitz,

254
00:10:24,831 --> 00:10:26,124
when is the Joseph Miller meeting again?

255
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,709
-4:45.
-4:45?

256
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,336
That's what he said, 4:45.

257
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,255
Hey, what are you drawing there, Ethan?

258
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,424
Mommy's friend. Bathroom!

259
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,552
Mr. Maisel, I am not
cleaning that bathroom again.

260
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,304
I got it, Mrs. Moskowitz.

261
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,973
He's like a sprung
garden hose, that child.

262
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,058
-Mommy's got a friend.
-Fuck you.

263
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,936
Aha, baby's first swear word.

264
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,147
Definitely not her first.

265
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,818
What is your life, anyhow?

266
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,279
JOEL: Ethan!

267
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,615
Remember, pal, you have
to look where you're aiming

268
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,492
-when you use the urinal.
-Why?

269
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,369
Because if you keep hitting
the floor and the counter

270
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,206
and the ceiling, no girl's
ever gonna marry you,

271
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,790
and Mrs. Moskowitz is
gonna leave your daddy,

272
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,334
so we'll both be alone.

273
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,504
Hey. So, Mommy has a new friend, huh?

274
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,214
-Yeah.
-And you met him?

275
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,798
-Yeah.
-Where?

276
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,051
At the park.

277
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,721
I thought you had to go to the bathroom.

278
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,807
ETHAN: Not fun now!

279
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,854
-This one?
-Second wedding.

280
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:33,444
-This one?
-Second wedding.

281
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,447
-This one.
-Miriam, please.

282
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,783
You can't wear white.
It's a second wedding.

283
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,786
-You can wear champagne.
-I don't want to wear champagne.

284
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,121
It's not a color.
It's what happens when white gets sad.

285
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,250
Well, I'm sorry.
Second weddings are subtle, dignified.

286
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:50,710
No big halls or lavish dinners.

287
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,796
Second weddings mean 40 guests

288
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,756
and a luncheon at home
with scrambled eggs.

289
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,383
Wow. What's the third wedding mean?

290
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:57,842
Third wedding means I'm dead.

291
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,886
-Can I wear white?
-Keep looking, please.

292
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,680
There may not even
be a wedding at this rate.

293
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,474
Papa still hasn't said yes.

294
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:04,934
Plus, he said if he does say yes,

295
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:06,978
-he's not gonna pay for it.
-Yes, he will.

296
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:09,730
He'll pay for a second wedding
here at home with scrambled…

297
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:11,857
Scrambled eggs and a champagne dress.

298
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:13,609
Oh, now cheer up.
You can still give a toast.

299
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:15,653
I know you have your
heart set on giving a toast.

300
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:17,196
-How do you know that?
-Ladies.

301
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,864
Papa. Hi!

302
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:21,367
There's a sandwich for
you in the refrigerator, Abe.

303
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:24,036
Papa? Hey, Papa?

304
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,871
Papa? Papa?

305
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:27,915
Miriam, do you get paid by the "Papa"?

306
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:30,084
-No.
-[SIGHS]

307
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:33,170
-So, Papa…
-Pickles.

308
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:35,298
I was just wondering if
you've thought any more

309
00:12:35,382 --> 00:12:36,841
about your talk with Benjamin?

310
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:39,385
-No.
-No? Just no?

311
00:12:39,469 --> 00:12:41,596
No. Yes, no.

312
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,265
Well, you know from experience,
the sooner you book a hall,

313
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:45,725
the better deal you get.

314
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:47,560
ROSE: No hall! Second wedding!

315
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:49,521
I do not have an answer yet.

316
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:52,190
Well, is there anything you
want to talk about with me?

317
00:12:52,274 --> 00:12:54,401
-No.
-Anything I can tell you?

318
00:12:54,485 --> 00:12:56,903
-No. Wait. Yes.
-Great. What?

319
00:12:56,987 --> 00:12:58,905
Do you ever call him Ben?

320
00:12:58,989 --> 00:13:00,907
-No.
-Benny?

321
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:02,993
-No.
-Dr. Ben?

322
00:13:03,077 --> 00:13:04,953
-No.
-Okay.

323
00:13:05,037 --> 00:13:07,080
Thank you for that information.

324
00:13:07,164 --> 00:13:10,083
Papa? Papa…

325
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:12,544
For a woman who wants to
make her fortune on the stage,

326
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:14,421
you have an extremely limited vocabulary.

327
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:16,006
Why won't you give your permission?

328
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,841
I didn't say I wouldn't
give my permission.

329
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:19,509
I just said I haven't decided yet.

330
00:13:19,593 --> 00:13:21,094
Well, what's taking you so long?

331
00:13:21,178 --> 00:13:23,055
I have to run his numbers again.

332
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:24,681
I don't think his figures add up.

333
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:26,350
It's not fair to make him wait.

334
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:28,060
Well, if he doesn't like it,

335
00:13:28,144 --> 00:13:30,479
he can go ahead and marry
you without my permission.

336
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:32,230
Joel did. That turned out great.

337
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:34,775
Forget it.

338
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:36,653
When I've decided, you'll know.

339
00:13:36,737 --> 00:13:38,696
-Fine.
-I'll send up a flare.

340
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,740
Super.

341
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:42,659
Miriam, wait.

342
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:45,078
I need to ask you something.

343
00:13:48,123 --> 00:13:50,625
What did you say in Washington?

344
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:52,752
What did I say about what?

345
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:55,672

00:47:58,465 --> 00:48:00,509
Colombia owns our apartment, Abe.

1207
00:48:05,264 --> 00:48:09,434
Yes… they do.

1208
00:48:09,518 --> 00:48:11,478
So, what do we do?

1209
00:48:11,562 --> 00:48:13,730
Move in with Miriam and Benjamin?

1210
00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:24,240
You'd really better sit down.

00:48:29,121 --> 00:48:31,039
<i>gonna fix the problem. We've decided</i>

1214
00:48:31,123 --> 00:48:32,958
that once a month, we
will book a comedian

1215
00:48:33,042 --> 00:48:34,168
-who will offend everyone.
-[LAUGHTER]

1216
00:48:34,252 --> 00:48:36,003
Fair enough? All right.

1217
00:48:36,087 --> 00:48:37,713
-MIDGE: He knows I'm coming.
-MAN: Doesn't matter.

1218
00:48:37,797 --> 00:48:39,381
-He knows I'm coming.
-You're not on the list.

1219
00:48:39,465 --> 00:48:40,841
-He knows I'm coming.
-He didn't leave a name.

1220
00:48:40,925 --> 00:48:42,384
He knows I'm coming. Lenny.

1221
00:48:42,468 --> 00:48:44,303
It's all right, Perry. She's my mother.

1222
00:48:44,387 --> 00:48:46,222
You didn't leave my name.
Perry's having a heart attack.

1223
00:48:46,306 --> 00:48:47,848
I'm very sorry, Perry.
It won't happen again.

1224
00:48:47,932 --> 00:48:49,433
People's names are
supposed to be on the list.

1225
00:48:49,517 --> 00:48:51,101
That's how it works.

1226
00:48:51,185 --> 00:48:53,145
There goes the next
president of the United States.

1227
00:48:53,229 --> 00:48:54,522
Never mind him. Let me look at you.

1228
00:48:54,606 --> 00:48:58,067
Good suit. Nice tie. Hair's fine.

1229
00:48:58,151 --> 00:49:01,070
Get ready for your intro.
Only he goes onstage.

1230
00:49:01,154 --> 00:49:03,322
Hmm, Perry knows
me better than I thought.

1231
00:49:03,406 --> 00:49:05,157
STEVE: Now, ladies and gentlemen,

1232
00:49:05,241 --> 00:49:06,992
here is a very shocking comedian,

1233
00:49:07,076 --> 00:49:09,036
the most shocking comedian of our time.

1234
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,580
A young man who is skyrocketing to fame,

1235
00:49:11,664 --> 00:49:12,915
-Lenny Bruce.
-[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]

1236
00:49:12,999 --> 00:49:16,001
-Tits up.
-Thanks.

1237
00:49:16,085 --> 00:49:18,585
-You'll explain that when I get back?
-Yes, I will.

1238
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:31,184

Taylor become bar mitzvahed?

[LAUGHTER]

1240
00:49:32,728 --> 00:49:34,354
Yeah, I promise continuity.

1241
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:36,022
I'll do all the lines that we rehearsed.

1242
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,108
And actually, I do have

1243
00:49:38,192 --> 00:49:41,778
and always will be accused of banter.

1244
00:49:41,862 --> 00:49:43,572
Ha! Yeah.

1245
00:49:43,656 --> 00:49:46,449
But there is another side to my nature

1246
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:48,493
uh, the aesthetic side.

1247
00:49:48,577 --> 00:49:51,580
-[PIANO PLAYING]
-A Clyde Beatty. Ha!

1248
00:49:51,664 --> 00:49:53,999
-And I'm going to, uh…
-[CHUCKLES]

1249
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:55,667
Oh, did you dig that?

1250
00:49:55,751 --> 00:49:57,711
-Yeah.
-Oh, I'm so happy.

1251
00:49:57,795 --> 00:50:01,172
And I'm going to write a
musical, uh, with Steve Allen.

1252
00:50:01,256 --> 00:50:03,633
And it's sort of a nice kind of thing.

1253
00:50:03,717 --> 00:50:05,760
And it's about a couple,

1254
00:50:05,844 --> 00:50:08,764
and if you've been married,
you know, or are now,

1255
00:50:08,848 --> 00:50:10,474
you know the scene that happens.

1256
00:50:10,558 --> 00:50:12,685
You have a million
beefs with your old lady,

1257
00:50:12,769 --> 00:50:15,396
and you break up, then
you go back together again.

1258
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,399
But this couple in the play,
they're a little eccentric,

1259
00:50:18,483 --> 00:50:21,027
and they've broken up and gone back

1260
00:50:21,111 --> 00:50:24,363
about 55 times in seven years.

1261
00:50:24,447 --> 00:50:27,033
But they keep going
back for the kids' sake.

1262
00:50:27,117 --> 00:50:29,911
So, finally, they go to
a marriage counselor,

1263
00:50:29,995 --> 00:50:32,413
it opens up, and they're together,

1264
00:50:32,497 --> 00:50:35,458
and they're happy without one argument.

1265
00:50:35,542 --> 00:50:37,335
But the kids are complete nuts

1266
00:50:37,419 --> 00:50:41,088
'cause they were so
adjusted to that scene

1267
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:43,716
you know, breaking up
and going back together

1268
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,468
that it's been too much for them.

1269
00:50:45,552 --> 00:50:48,471
So they decide, for the kids' sake,

1270
00:50:48,555 --> 00:50:50,222
to break up.

1271
00:50:50,306 --> 00:50:52,141
And in the scene,

1272
00:50:52,225 --> 00:50:53,852
Steve, like, you know, he's my friend,

1273
00:50:53,936 --> 00:50:55,604
and we're hanging out together,

1274
00:50:55,688 --> 00:50:57,606
and, uh, he's got the first line.

1275
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:00,400
All right.
Hey, Lenny, where's your old lady?

1276
00:51:00,484 --> 00:51:03,570
-Oh, we had a beef, man. We broke up.
-Oh, that's too bad.

1277
00:51:03,654 --> 00:51:05,113
But don't worry, you'll
get back together.

1278
00:51:05,197 --> 00:51:06,823
No, that's it, you know?

1279
00:51:06,907 --> 00:51:08,909
You have a million fights,
and finally you decide

1280
00:51:08,993 --> 00:51:10,535
that's the one. You've had it, you know?

1281
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:12,412
And I finally got the
guts, and I got rid of her.

1282
00:51:12,496 --> 00:51:14,373
I don't believe it,
man, but I finally did it.

1283
00:51:14,457 --> 00:51:16,667
-I finally got rid of her.
-How'd you do that?

1284
00:51:16,751 --> 00:51:18,002
She left me.

1285
00:51:19,587 --> 00:51:21,129
But it's better off, man.

1286
00:51:21,213 --> 00:51:22,464
You're better off alone.

1287
00:51:22,548 --> 00:51:24,341
I'm really gonna swing.

1288
00:51:24,425 --> 00:51:26,927
I'm gonna fix up my own pad.

1289
00:51:27,011 --> 00:51:29,054
That's it. I can really fix up a pad.

1290
00:51:29,138 --> 00:51:32,557
I'm gonna really get some
of that shiny black furniture.

1291
00:51:32,641 --> 00:51:34,518
And I'll get a bullfight poster.

1292
00:51:34,602 --> 00:51:37,562
And I'll get a coffee table,
and I'll make a door out of it.

1293
00:51:37,646 --> 00:51:41,275
And I'll just really swing,
and it'll just be nice.

1294
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,695
And I'll get a satin smoking jacket

1295
00:51:43,779 --> 00:51:45,989
and a pearl white phone,
and I'll sit back and relax,

1296
00:51:46,073 --> 00:51:47,865
and finally I'll be all alone, man.

1297
00:51:47,949 --> 00:51:53,413
That's the best way to make it.

He wants me to go on tour with him.

1373
00:55:41,229 --> 00:55:43,356
He says I'll be gone six months.

1374
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,901
And I said yes.

1375
00:55:46,985 --> 00:55:48,402
Just like that.

1376
00:55:48,486 --> 00:55:49,946
Didn't even think about it.

1377
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:53,282
Didn't think about anything or anyone.

1378
00:55:53,366 --> 00:55:55,868
Just yes.

1379
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,663
And I understand now.

1380
00:55:58,747 --> 00:56:02,208
Everything's different.

1381
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:04,877
I can't go back to Jell-O molds.

1382
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:09,090
There won't be three before 30 for me.

1383
00:56:09,174 --> 00:56:11,884
I just made a choice.

1384
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:16,389
-Midge…
-I am gonna be all alone

1385
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:20,102
for the rest of my life.

1386
00:56:20,186 --> 00:56:22,646
That's what I just decided
in a five-minute phone call.

1387
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:25,524
Amazing, isn't it?

1388
00:56:25,608 --> 00:56:27,526
You don't know that. You don't…

1389
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:29,152
I'm gonna leave really soon.

1390
00:56:29,236 --> 00:56:30,737
Barely enough time to get packed.

1391
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:32,471
Especially the way that I travel.

1392
00:56:35,076 --> 00:56:38,328
And I don't want to be alone.

1393
00:56:38,412 --> 00:56:40,706
Not tonight.

1394
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:44,584
Tonight… just for tonight…

1395
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:47,797
I really need to be with
someone who loves me.

1396
00:56:53,427 --> 00:56:55,777
