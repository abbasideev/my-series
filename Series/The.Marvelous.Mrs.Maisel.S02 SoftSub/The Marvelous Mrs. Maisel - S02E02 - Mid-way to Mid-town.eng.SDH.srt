This wall is for bookshelves,
I think a console over here.

680
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:20,029
A radio, record player…

681
00:28:20,113 --> 00:28:21,364
-Are they dog friendly?
-They're dog friendly.

682
00:28:21,448 --> 00:28:22,907
They have to be dog friendly.

683
00:28:22,991 --> 00:28:24,492
Plus, there's a little
park around the corner

684
00:28:24,576 --> 00:28:25,576
where we could throw her little ball.

685
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,661
She loves that little ball.

686
00:28:26,745 --> 00:28:28,287
It's special, isn't it?

687
00:28:28,371 --> 00:28:31,499
-Well, it is just a ball.
-No, the apartment.

688
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:33,834
-Oh, yes, it's magnificent.
-I know.

689
00:28:33,918 --> 00:28:35,378
I mean, I love our little place,

690
00:28:35,462 --> 00:28:37,713
but it's not very
practical for the long term.

691
00:28:37,797 --> 00:28:40,841
Though I will miss the boys,
but we'll just have to get used to

692
00:28:40,925 --> 00:28:42,260
our own bathroom again.

693
00:28:42,344 --> 00:28:44,845
And hot water, we'll have to
get used to hot water again.

694
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:49,433
-Rose.
-[ROSE CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY]

695
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:51,686
-Rose.
-Hmm?

696
00:28:53,855 --> 00:28:56,274
We can't buy this apartment.

697
00:28:56,358 --> 00:28:57,650
Why not?

698
00:28:57,734 --> 00:28:59,694
Because we don't live here.

699
00:28:59,778 --> 00:29:01,445
Well, we will after we buy the place.

700
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:03,573
In Paris, we don't live in Paris.

701
00:29:03,657 --> 00:29:04,907
We have to go home.

702
00:29:04,991 --> 00:29:06,409
Paris is home.

703
00:29:06,493 --> 00:29:08,077
No, Rose, it's not.

704
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:09,662
Why not?

705
00:29:09,746 --> 00:29:11,914
Because my classes at
Columbia start in a week.

706
00:29:11,998 --> 00:29:13,749
I'm a tenured professor.

707
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:16,043
And if I don't go back, I'll
lose my spot at Bell Labs.

708
00:29:16,127 --> 00:29:18,629
And if I don't go back, what will I lose?

709
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:21,549
-Well…
-Drapes will have to be made,

710
00:29:21,633 --> 00:29:23,134
but the shutters will do for now.

711
00:29:23,218 --> 00:29:25,761
Rose, stop. Our lives are in New York.

712
00:29:25,845 --> 00:29:27,179
Your friends are in New York.

713
00:29:27,263 --> 00:29:28,764
Your… Your garden club is in New York.

714
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:31,058
I have friends here, too. So do you.

715
00:29:31,142 --> 00:29:33,185
-What friends?
-What are you talking about?

716
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:35,896
Thierry, Rolf, Sergei.
Have you forgotten about them?

717
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,773
Of course not.

718
00:29:37,857 --> 00:29:39,900
You're part of their group;
you're… you're one of them.

719
00:29:39,984 --> 00:29:43,822
I am not one of th…
I have no idea what they're talking about.

720
00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:46,450
They could be sitting there
saying, "That idiot, Abe,

721
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,869
"thinks we like him.
Let's set his coat on fire,

722
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,912
and see how long it takes him to notice."

723
00:29:50,996 --> 00:29:52,623
Well, not Thierry, he cries too much,

724
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,458
but Sergei, he looks like a pyro.

725
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,460
That's not true; they're kindred spirits.

726
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,795
They all drink 40 cups of coffee a day

727
00:29:58,879 --> 00:30:00,631
and switch to absinthe at noon.

728
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,050
They all have wives and girlfriends.

729
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,636
-So what?
-I don't want a girlfriend.

730
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,013
I'm still getting used to a maid.

731
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:11,016
I am not French. I'm different.

732
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,143
You're adjusting.
Yo… You're learning the language.

733
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:15,062
"Thursday," I learned "Thursday."

734
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,356
W… Wednesday can't be far behind.

735
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,191
Rose.

736
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,569
I want to go home.

737
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:26,157
This has been a wonderful vacation…

738
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,078
But it's time to go back to our life.

739
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,788
What life?

740
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,748
My daughter does not want my guidance.

741
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:36,333
You have no need for my input.

742
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,918
I'm alone in New York.

743
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,337
Here, I have art.

744
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:43,423
I have independence; no
one looks at me with pity.

745
00:30:43,507 --> 00:30:45,676
-No one looks at you…
-Poor Rose, she's too fragile

746
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,428
to be told the truth, too
delicate to confide in.

747
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:50,722
She'll shatter.

748
00:30:50,806 --> 00:30:56,978
Here in Paris, I'm… shatterproof.

749
00:30:57,062 --> 00:30:59,231
I'm… I'm sorry I lied to you.

750
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,775
I'll never do it again.

751
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:05,195
And I… I promise we will figure out a way

752
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,447
to make it better once we get back.

753
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:10,367
But we have to go back.

754
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,661
Do you hear me?

755
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,455
Rose.

756
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:18,209
Rosie.

757
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:29,804
[DOOR SLAMS]

758
00:31:32,306 --> 00:31:34,015
Wait.

759
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:35,767
[SNIFFS] Smell that?

760
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:37,228
Smells like cheap beer and piss.

761
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,272
I know. Exciting, right?

762
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:40,648
Hi. I'm working here tonight.

763
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,191
-I'm a comic.
-Oh.

764
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,484
What's up her ass?

765
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,610
Tone down the perk.

766
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,737
We're in a real club now.

767
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:46,821
Sorry.

768
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,156
Fuck you, keep walking.

769
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,365
There you go.

770
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,285
Aha. There he is.

771
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,911
Bobby, hi.

772
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,913
Susie Myerson of Susie
Myerson and Associates.

773
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,999
I don't need that.
You're my girl comedian?

774
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,375
-Yes, I am.
-All right.

775
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,043
I have you down for an eight-minute slot.

776
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,378
Eight minutes. Eight minutes.
Eight minutes?

777
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,838
-I'll talk fast.
-Eight minutes is great.

778
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,839
Here's four drink tickets.

779
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,466
You're up third.

780
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,426
-Third. Good slot.
-Really?

781
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,094
Are you kidding? Third is perfect.

782
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,096
The crowd is warmed up but not worn out.

783
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,598
Yeah? Okay. Third. Great.

784
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,933
How do I look? Hair? Makeup? Teeth?

785
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,186
Excuse me. Uh, Mrs. Maisel, is it?

786
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,604
-Midge is fine.
-Oh.

787
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,230
Midge is fine. Isn't Midge fine?

788
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,025
Bobby told us there was a
lady comic coming on tonight.

789
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,693
Didn't tell us she was quite so pretty.

790
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,820
-Well, thank you.
-EUGENE: That is a lovely dress.

791
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,697
Susie Myerson. I'm her manager.

792
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,616
EUGENE: So you're the girl
from the Gaslight gig, right?

793
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,409
Lenny Bruce's girl.

794
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,911
Oh, I'm not his girl, just his friend.

795
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,245
EUGENE: So what kind of act do you do?

796
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,915
Birds? Violin? Wait… singer.

797
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,249
-Nope.
-STAN: Oh, you should sing.

798
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,501
EUGENE: You'd clean up as a singer.

799
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:42,919
But I… I don't sing.

800
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,587
It doesn't matter, just wear that dress.

801
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,924
Hey, so one colleague to
another, uh, you and Lenny…

802
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,383
Me and Lenny what?

803
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,219
Well, what he did for
you, that was pretty big.

804
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,221
You must've done something
pretty big for him first, right?

805
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,056
Nothing but respect if you did.

806
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,099
Hey, I'd sleep with
Lenny Bruce if he asked.

807
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:57,850
The man is a god.

808
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,769
She did not fucking
sleep with Lenny Bruce.

809
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:01,145
-Yeah.
-And even if she did,

810
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,647
that's not why he did the gig.

811
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,190
I… I didn't sleep with him.

812
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,608
I know, but my point is,

813
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,276
even if you did, it doesn't matter.

814
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,111
-Yeah, but I didn't.
-I know, but if you did…

815
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,696
For fuck's sake.

816
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,657
Wow, little lady's got a potty mouth.

817
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:16,036
-Lenny teach you that also?
-[BOTH CHUCKLE]

818
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,413
-Well, I like them.
-Oh, relax.

819
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,457
Odds are at least one of
them has late-stage syphilis.

820
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,542
I'm getting a drink.

821
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:23,626
-You want one?
-Nope.

822
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,627
-You want to sit?
-Nope.

823
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,045
I am going to stay fresh.

824
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,588
Okay, well, as long as you're okay

825
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,131
with me sitting and drinking, we're good.

826
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,842
BOBBY: Hey, everybody, I'm Bobby Stelter,

827
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,511
your humble host for the evening.

828
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:35,138
Are you guys in the
mood for a fantastic show?

829
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,140
-[APPLAUSE]
-All right, then what you want to do

830
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,767
is walk outside and
catch a cab to the Copa

831
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,060
'cause it ain't happening here.

832
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:41,353
Now, let's bring up our first comic.

833
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:43,689
He's Canadian, but
don't hold that against him.

834
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:45,650
Joey Parker!

835
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:50,153
Thanks, Bobby.

836
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:51,947
True story.

837
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:55,826
Before John Wayne was famous,
he was a prop man on movie sets.

838
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,829
But what if he never became "The Duke"

839
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:00,789
and was still working behind the scenes?

840
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:03,667
Could you see him having to
be James Mason's prop guy?

841
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,210
[LAUGHTER]

842
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:08,005
[IMITATING JOHN WAYNE]:
Well, here ya go, pilgrim.

843
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:09,631
[IMITATING JAMES MASON]: A gun?

844
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,593
-Why are you handing me a gun?
-[LAUGHTER]

845
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:15,220
[IMITATING JOHN WAYNE]:
It's a Colt Single Action.

846
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:17,389
They'll know who's boss.

847
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:19,641
-Mrs. Maisel.
-Yes, here.

848
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,560
-Put your hand down.
-Slight change.

849
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:23,395
You're gonna go on fourth now, okay?

850
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:24,771
Oh, sure. Fourth.

851

Great. How do I look?

1021
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:21,108
Hey. Get up. Manage shit.

1022
00:41:21,192 --> 00:41:22,860
SUSIE: Sorry. Okay.

1023
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,570
Remember to wait for
the laughs completely.

1024
00:41:24,654 --> 00:41:26,864
-You were rushing last week.
-I know. I'll remember.

1025
00:41:26,948 --> 00:41:28,907
-NOAH: …money and a hand job.
-[LAUGHTER]

1026
00:41:28,991 --> 00:41:31,785
-Okay. Tits up.
-Tits up.

1027
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:34,496
Well, that's it for me tonight.
You've been a great audience.

1028
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,498
[APPLAUSE]

1029
00:41:36,582 --> 00:41:38,500
Everybody, you're not gonna believe it,

1030
00:41:38,584 --> 00:41:40,210
but someone just walked in the door

1031
00:41:40,294 --> 00:41:42,296
and there's no way he's
leaving without doing his thing.

1032
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,174
Jackie Vernon, get up here, man.

1033
00:41:47,176 --> 00:41:49,595
Jackie Vernon!

1034
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,683
-Let him hear it.
-[CHEERS, APPLAUSE]

1035
00:41:57,145 --> 00:42:00,272
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.

1036
00:42:00,356 --> 00:42:02,816
Tonight I'd like to
talk about rejections.

1037
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,653
My personal rejections
brought on a weight problem.

1038
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:09,031
Every time a girl would refuse me a date,

1039
00:42:09,115 --> 00:42:12,951
I'd eat a piece of Bavarian cream pie.

1040
00:42:13,035 --> 00:42:16,497
One day I ate 238 pieces
of Bavarian cream pie.

1041
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:18,665
-[LAUGHTER]
-So close, and then he shows up.

1042
00:42:18,749 --> 00:42:21,418
But don't worry.
He's gonna be really easy to follow.

1043
00:42:21,502 --> 00:42:23,670
He's just super warming
the place up for you.

1044
00:42:23,754 --> 00:42:25,297
Like he's doing you a favor.

1045
00:42:25,381 --> 00:42:26,757
Thought you had to be somewhere.

1046
00:42:26,841 --> 00:42:28,801
And miss Jackie Vernon? Not a chance.

1047
00:42:28,885 --> 00:42:31,303
VERNON: My doctor told me to
cut out all sugar and use saccharin.

1048
00:42:31,387 --> 00:42:34,681
I used so much saccharin, I
developed artificial diabetes.

1049
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:36,100
[LAUGHTER]

1050
00:42:36,184 --> 00:42:37,851
Okay, that's it. I'll have a martini.

1051
00:42:37,935 --> 00:42:39,603
We're out of drink tickets.

1052
00:42:39,687 --> 00:42:41,563
I… I need something to eat, too.

1053
00:42:41,647 --> 00:42:43,023
Oh, hot dogs. Two hot dogs.

1054
00:42:43,107 --> 00:42:44,608
Pay him for the hot dogs.

1055
00:42:44,692 --> 00:42:46,693
This is turning out to
be a very expensive gig.

1056
00:42:46,777 --> 00:42:48,737
Well, at least you're not
wearing the same outfit.

1057
00:42:48,821 --> 00:42:50,447
I should have seen this coming.

1058
00:42:50,531 --> 00:42:52,241
This whole day has been weird.

1059
00:42:52,325 --> 00:42:54,785
Joel decided to find me an apartment.

1060
00:42:54,869 --> 00:42:57,496
Good. It's time that loser did
something other than his hair.

1061
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,706
My own apartment.
I never lived on my own.

1062
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,917
I went from my parents, to college,

1063
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:03,669
back to my parents, to Joel.

1064
00:43:03,753 --> 00:43:05,839
I feel like I've been living
alone since I was nine.

1065
00:43:05,923 --> 00:43:07,590
-[LAUGHTER]
-I'm a little scared.

1066
00:43:07,674 --> 00:43:09,843
I mean, what happens
when the toilet clogs?

1067
00:43:09,927 --> 00:43:12,345
You get a plunger and
plunge all the shit out.

1068
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:13,721
Ugh!

1069
00:43:13,805 --> 00:43:15,432
You are gonna die on your own.

1070
00:43:15,516 --> 00:43:17,684
They're gonna find you
on the floor half eaten

1071
00:43:17,768 --> 00:43:20,103
by your feral children, still
clutching the fucking plunger.

1072
00:43:20,187 --> 00:43:21,521
Hey, new subject.

1073
00:43:21,605 --> 00:43:23,565
Got a telegram from my parents.

1074
00:43:23,649 --> 00:43:25,150
Oh. They're coming home?

1075
00:43:25,234 --> 00:43:26,693
They're coming home.

1076
00:43:26,777 --> 00:43:28,570
We have to figure out
your living situation.

1077
00:43:28,654 --> 00:43:30,488
Hey, you were the one who was scared.

1078
00:43:30,572 --> 00:43:32,574
I'm fine going back to my apartment.

1079
00:43:32,658 --> 00:43:34,576
-Uh-uh.
-[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]

1080
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,661
If you are shy, timid and meek,

1081
00:43:36,745 --> 00:43:38,705
you shouldn't be too worried about it

1082
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:40,582
because the meek will inherit the earth.

1083
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:42,667
They wouldn't have
the nerve to refuse it.

1084
00:43:42,751 --> 00:43:44,502
-[LAUGHTER]
-Oh, come on.

1085
00:43:44,586 --> 00:43:45,879
What's your problem?

1086
00:43:45,963 --> 00:43:47,755
I have mustard on my dress.

1087
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,549
Oh, yeah, right on your tit.

1088
00:43:49,633 --> 00:43:51,301
It's not working.

1089
00:43:51,385 --> 00:43:52,969
Of course not. That's tequila.

1090
00:43:53,053 --> 00:43:54,721
-Try gin.
-Look at me.

1091
00:43:54,805 --> 00:43:57,348
Look at my dress.
It's all wrinkled and stained.

1092
00:43:57,432 --> 00:43:59,309
I told you I shouldn't sit down.

1093
00:43:59,393 --> 00:44:01,811
-I didn't tell you to sit down.
-You motioned.

1094
00:44:01,895 --> 00:44:04,522
I'm drunk. I was probably
grabbing the air for balance.

1095
00:44:04,606 --> 00:44:06,649
How am I going to go up there like this?

1096
00:44:06,733 --> 00:44:08,526
Oh, don't worry.
This guy's never getting off.

1097
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,778
I'm wrinkled, I'm stained.

1098
00:44:10,862 --> 00:44:13,031
-Plus…
-Plus what?

1099
00:44:13,115 --> 00:44:16,409
Well… you're a little pungent.

1100
00:44:16,493 --> 00:44:18,077
I am not pungent.

1101
00:44:18,161 --> 00:44:20,163
I am downwind. I kind of know.

1102
00:44:20,247 --> 00:44:21,873
Never. Never.

1103
00:44:21,957 --> 00:44:23,750
I have never in my life been…

1104
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:25,335
[SNIFFING] What is that?

1105
00:44:25,419 --> 00:44:27,212
-That's you.
-It's…

1106
00:44:27,296 --> 00:44:31,216
-No, that's…
-[LAUGHS]

1107
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,759
Well, what do you expect?

1108
00:44:32,843 --> 00:44:34,802
I sweat a little before I go on,

1109
00:44:34,886 --> 00:44:36,888
which has happened
four times so far tonight.

1110
00:44:36,972 --> 00:44:40,141
Well, folks, I don't want
you to get excited or panicky,

1111
00:44:40,225 --> 00:44:42,185
but I just finished.

1112
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:43,853
How about a hand for the suit?

1113
00:44:43,937 --> 00:44:45,897
Hey, he's done. Get ready.

[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]

1117
00:44:57,034 --> 00:44:58,743
Who could possibly follow him, huh?

1118
00:44:58,827 --> 00:45:00,328
Well, you're about to find out.

1119
00:45:00,412 --> 00:45:02,081
They're leaving.

1120
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:04,041
-They smelled me.
-Just get up there.

1121
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:06,210
Hey, where you going?
Sit down. Sit back down.

1122
00:45:06,294 --> 00:45:08,671
Hey, the best is yet to come.
The show is not over.

1123
00:45:08,755 --> 00:45:10,422
-Sit your ass back down!
-BOBBY: Ladies and gentlemen,

1124
00:45:10,506 --> 00:45:12,800
welcome an adorable lady who,

1125
00:45:12,884 --> 00:45:16,095
if she can't make you laugh,
can at least make you dinner.

1126
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:18,180
Mrs. My-zell.

1127

-Tits up.
-Arms down.

1129
00:45:28,441 --> 00:45:30,651
-Hey, where's the light?
-The light guy left.

1130
00:45:30,735 --> 00:45:33,153
What the fuck? She needs a spot.

1131
00:45:33,237 --> 00:45:34,863
Uh, good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1132
00:45:34,947 --> 00:45:37,866
I'm Mrs. Maisel.

Uh, it's… it's so nice to be here.

1136
00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:44,290
It's nice of you to stay.

1137
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:48,586
I was supposed to go
on earlier, a lot earlier,

1138
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:50,629
-before I looked like this.
-MAN: Yeah.

1139
00:45:50,713 --> 00:45:53,882
-Anyone have a comb?
-[WOMAN LAUGHS]

1140
00:45:53,966 --> 00:45:55,634
Women would get that

1141
00:45:55,718 --> 00:45:58,721
because there's… there's
no way a comb could fix this.

1142
00:45:58,805 --> 00:46:00,556
-[SOFT LAUGHTER]
-A bomb would help.

1143
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,808
Group blindness would work wonders.

1144
00:46:02,892 --> 00:46:05,311
Anyhow, it wasn't that great a joke.

1145
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:06,895
Or even a joke.

1146
00:46:06,979 --> 00:46:08,981
Uh, an amusing observation, perhaps.

1147
00:46:09,065 --> 00:46:10,899
A wry comment, if you will.

1148
00:46:10,983 --> 00:46:14,862
I'm sorry. I feel so unfocused right now.

1149
00:46:14,946 --> 00:46:16,905
I was really in the pocket earlier,

1150
00:46:16,989 --> 00:46:19,325
ready, fresh.

1151
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,493
Then I had a drink, and…

1152
00:46:21,577 --> 00:46:23,871

It's changing so fast.

00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:35,507
I was married, I'm not married.

1157
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:37,593
I'm going to have to live
alone with my two children.

1158

It's all going to be up to me

00:46:39,345 --> 00:46:42,931
to take care of them,
of myself, of the toilet.

1160

at this very minute,

is those fucking losers at the bar.

just standing there,

It's midnight on a Tuesday

and the highlight of their evening

1179

is the possibility of
