-Hey, that guy's over there.
-What guy?

2
00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:12,350
That guy that told you
about that thing that day.

3
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:13,769
That thing about the weird
dude and his weird friend

4
00:00:13,853 --> 00:00:15,353
-doing that dumb thing?
-Then you told me and I told you

5
00:00:15,437 --> 00:00:16,563
I'd already heard about
it, and you said it was

6
00:00:16,647 --> 00:00:18,023
a different thing but it wasn't?

7
00:00:18,107 --> 00:00:19,983
-Oh, yeah.
-What's his name? I forget.

8
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:21,610
I don't know. Something to do with fish.

9
00:00:21,694 --> 00:00:23,528
-Oh, that's gonna bother me.
-FRED: Hey, Susie.

10
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:26,364
You hear about the big arthritis
telethon on WNPO next Tuesday?

11
00:00:26,448 --> 00:00:28,659
They're looking for acts
but spots are going fast.

12
00:00:28,743 --> 00:00:31,078
A spot? On TV? That would be sensational.

13
00:00:31,162 --> 00:00:32,121
Why am I just hearing about this?

14
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:33,498
Just heard it myself.

15
00:00:33,582 --> 00:00:34,874
Margie the booker's at table six.

16
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:37,251
You gotta give me a heads-up
about these things, Fred.

17
00:00:37,335 --> 00:00:38,961
I don't work for you!

18
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:40,546
Margie, Susie Myerson.

19
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,548
I rep a comic that would
be great for the telethon.

20
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:43,758
She's an up-and-comer.

21
00:00:43,842 --> 00:00:45,093
Get someone I know to vouch for her

22
00:00:45,177 --> 00:00:46,220
and maybe I'll work her in.

23
00:00:46,304 --> 00:00:47,721
Piece of cake.

24
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:49,223
Dougie, you know Margie?

25
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:51,016
From way back. She's doing the telethon.

26
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,893
-Go vouch for my girl?
-Done deal.

27
00:00:52,977 --> 00:00:54,478
Yes.

28
00:00:54,562 --> 00:00:56,313
-MIDGE: Well?
-It's in the bag.

29
00:00:56,397 --> 00:00:57,689
That's fantastic.

30
00:00:57,773 --> 00:00:59,650
-It's dead. Dougie said.
-What? Why?

31
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:01,443
FRED: Margie hates Dougie.
You should have gone to Kenny.

32
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:04,447
It's your job to keep me up
to date on these things, Fred.

33

-Where's Margie?
-Must've left.

Her assistant's at table 12.
She can pull the trigger.

Good thing for you, Fred.

Wait, did I say table 12?
I meant table ten.

Hey!

00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,061
-Kenny, you get along with Margie?
-I love Margie.

-You'll vouch for my girl?
-Sure thing.

Thanks.

Hey, sorry about the "bitch" thing.

-Margie's assistant?
-Who's askin'?

00:01:42,905 --> 00:01:44,239
Have I got a comic for the telethon.

52
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:45,365
Kenny'll vouch for her.

-Kenny?
-Problem?

-Cindy likes you.

-Why not?

-I got you dinner with Kenny.

My girl's name is Maisel.

I'll tell Margie to slot her in.

I was thinking branzino.

Mm. Joey Branzino's someone else.

66
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:11,517
He's not even in the business.

67
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:13,270

-There you go.
-Thank you, Zelda.

00:02:16,899 --> 00:02:18,734
The potatoes certainly
look nice and fluffy.

I know that's how you
like them, Mrs. Weissman.

You're welcome.

74
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:28,577
Zelda seems subtly
hostile to me this week.

75
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:30,204
How do you figure?

76
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:31,998
The way she served the potatoes.

77
00:02:32,082 --> 00:02:34,125
Yours, she served gently;

78
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:36,085
mine, she slopped
down like we're in Attica.

79
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:37,462
Oh, she didn't.

80
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:38,922
Yours are still nice and fluffy.

81
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:40,798
Mine have lost all their fluffy.

82
00:02:40,882 --> 00:02:42,550
Mine, she slopped down a little, too.

83
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:44,427
But you got a "there you go."
And so did your mother.

84
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:46,012
I didn't get a "there you go."

85
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:47,848
-You're imagining this, Abe.
-I like a nice

86
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:49,266
"there you go."

Or even an enthusiastic "enjoy."

-Start a new subject, Miriam.
-Well

89
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,649
there's a telethon next week.
You hear about it?

90
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:58,859
Ugh. That Jerry Lewis thing?
He's so loud.

91
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:00,861
ROSE: And I don't like
those facial distortions of his,

92
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:02,446
and that crazy voice; it feels desperate.

93
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,823
Jerry Lewis is muscular dystrophy.

94
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:06,993
This is a telethon for
arthritis and rheumatism.

95
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:09,245
-Oh, such a good cause.
-A very good cause.

96
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:10,872
Your mother's family
suffers from it, you know.

97
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:11,915
-Great Aunt Pearl.
-Poor woman

98
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:13,249
with those gnarled hands.

99
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,834
One day she picked up a Kiddush cup

100
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:16,252
and she couldn't set
it down for two years.

101
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:17,504
ABE: We should donate.

102
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:19,881
Those dollars are so
important for research.

103
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:22,217
Mm-hmm. How do we do that?
Call the broadcast?

104
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:25,054
Probably. There'll be phone
banks and celebrity guests

105
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,848
and performers, all
volunteering their time.

106
00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:29,725
-Wonderful.
-So selfless.

107
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,394
-I'll be one of them.
-One of what?

108
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:32,812
One of the performers.

109
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,317
I'll be performing on the telethon.

110
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,319
Doing comedy.

111
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:41,780
Can I use the Kiddush cup bit?

112
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:43,240
Some of them are scams.

113
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,282
-What are?
-These telethons.

114
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:45,575
They take the money

115
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:46,910
and line their own pockets.

116
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:49,997
-Jerry Lewis has multiple homes.
-Mama, that's ridiculous.

117
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,206
And those telethons look so cheap.

118
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,375
The cameramen never
know what to focus on.

119
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,836
-Not true.
-And no one's ever died from arthritis.

120
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,295
Aunt Pearl lived to be 90.

121
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:58,965
Just her head and neck worked at the end,

122
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,134
but it's all she needed for a full life.

join you for dinner?

00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:00,369
She does five minutes at 2150, solo act.

350
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:01,787
-Any props?
-Nope.

351
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:03,163
-Stand on the "X."
-Okay.

352
00:13:03,247 --> 00:13:04,707
-Mic check.
-One, two.

Oh, uh… okay.

356
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,088
Wait. We dragged ourselves
down here at 8:00 in the morning,

357
00:13:10,172 --> 00:13:11,548
-and that's it?
-That's it.

358
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:13,008
-I showered.
-Thank you for showering.

359
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,801
We'll see you tomorrow, 1600 hours.

360

When's that? Wait, Sal.

361
00:13:16,303 --> 00:13:18,054
Things move fast in
the television business.

362
00:13:18,138 --> 00:13:20,223
-Ah, there it is.
-What?

363
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:22,225
The control room.
Guys down at the deli told me

364
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:23,894
they're the people you
want to make friends with.

365
00:13:23,978 --> 00:13:26,272
They control things. Come on.

-WOMAN: Five minutes.

367
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,108
Does he say anything or just juggle?

368
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:30,776
He just juggles, Dickie.

369
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,778
I got to know how high he's
gonna throw those clubs.

370
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:33,904
Let's see how high he
throws the clubs, Sal.

371
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:35,323
-Hi, guys!
-Hey, what the hell.

372
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:37,158
-Who the hell is this?
-What are you doing in here?

I'm Susie Myerson, manager
to this budding young star.

Hi.

375
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:42,247
-Will you get her out?
-He can't throw 'em that high, Sal.

376
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:43,665
You'll take good care of her, boys?

377

-Go! Go!
-Get the fuck out of here!

378
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,209
Carry on.

379
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:47,586
God, I hate jugglers.

380
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,588
That was a really good start

381
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:52,633
on building a rapport
with a key group of guys.

-Who is that?

384
00:13:56,262 --> 00:13:57,638
-MIDGE: Shy Baldwin.
-MAN: Next!

385
00:13:57,722 --> 00:14:00,350
The singer? He's had, like, a
hundred hits in the last year.

386
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:02,685
That's Shy Baldwin?
For some reason, I thought he was fat.

387
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:05,813
-MIDGE: Why?
-He sounded fat.

388
00:14:05,897 --> 00:14:08,274
So there's gonna be
some big stars on this thing.

389
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:10,360
Guess so. [WHISTLES] I'm getting nervous.

390
00:14:10,444 --> 00:14:12,111
Don't say that.

391
00:14:12,195 --> 00:14:13,905
Just being honest. I'm getting nervous.

392
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:15,782
But when you get nervous, I get nervous.

00:14:15,866 --> 00:14:17,451
Don't be a copycat. Be your own person.

394
00:14:17,535 --> 00:14:19,912
I'm not a copycat.
It's just, you make me nervous.

395
00:14:19,996 --> 00:14:22,414
-Well, then don't follow me.
-We came in the same car.

I freak you out so much.

398
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:31,090
It's tip-top, Simon. Tip-top.

399
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:33,967
And Rose? And the kids? Is everyone well?

400
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:35,762
Just fine. Why?

401
00:14:35,846 --> 00:14:37,639
Because, Abe, you seem

402
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:39,933
-to be teetering on the edge.
-That's one man's opinion.

403
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:41,851
It's actually a lot of people's opinion.

00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:48,775
the administrative staff, the trustees,

407
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:50,276

the school nurse, the parking attendants…

00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,658
I don't need the entire list, Simon.

411
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:58,411
There are simply a lot of people
disturbed by your behavior.

412
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:01,163
Disturbed? That's a strong word, Simon.

413
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:03,207
Now please, cut to the chase here.

We've been sitting here for
ten minutes, and suddenly…

417
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:11,091
You should consider a sabbatical.

418
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:12,509
I have one planned in two years.

419
00:15:12,593 --> 00:15:14,302
Why don't you move it up?

420
00:15:14,386 --> 00:15:16,680
-My colleagues would complain.
-It was their suggestion.

421
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:19,182
And why would they suggest such a thing?

422
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:21,768
Because the parking
attendants told them to?

423
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:24,062
Are you not listening?
They're sick of you, Abe.

424
00:15:24,146 --> 00:15:26,898
You asked me to cut to the chase.
I'm cutting to the chase.

but an uncooperative colleague
and a very poor teacher.

00:15:47,922 --> 00:15:49,965
-With tenure.
-What about it?

431
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,176
-You can't fire me.
-I don't intend to.

What could possibly be
funny about this, Abe?

434
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:02,227
I was just thinking
about the irony of tenure.

435
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:04,898
-What irony?
-Well, for instance,

436
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:08,485
the fact that I could
take this cheese knife

437
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:10,695
and stick it in your eye,

438
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:13,448
and the university
would still have to pay me.

439
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:15,784
I'd be in jail, but I'd still be paid.

440
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:18,620
Are you seriously thinking of doing that?

441
00:16:20,163 --> 00:16:21,665
No.

442
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:23,459
You hesitated.

443
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:27,046
Yes.

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,048

-With a cheese knife.

I'll give it to her,

will be well, mm-hmm.

people to tag them back,
