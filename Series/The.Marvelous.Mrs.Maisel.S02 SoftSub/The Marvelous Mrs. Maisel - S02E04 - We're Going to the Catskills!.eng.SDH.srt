Do you like the name Benjamin?

1025

He's never rented.

1026

But as close as it was to his practice,

1029

he still found it to be too far.

His patients are everything to him,

1031
00:40:48,923 --> 00:40:51,300
so he sold the place at a loss.
Can you imagine that?

1032
00:40:51,384 --> 00:40:53,302
He bought a duplex just
a block from the hospital.

It has views, but not of the bridge.

1034
