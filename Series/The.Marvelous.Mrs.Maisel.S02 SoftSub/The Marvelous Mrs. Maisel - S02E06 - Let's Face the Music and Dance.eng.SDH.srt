One of the girls in my cabin, Laura?

She comes from a big
New York showbiz family.

518
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:43,218
I clawed some info on a contact from her,

519
00:20:43,302 --> 00:20:45,053

I didn't. Kids here, they
got two cents between them,

got me a brand-new one.

out for him as a favor to me.
