to come to the pre-opening.

-I bought those three last week.
-How much?

-For this one?
-Yeah.

-You're kidding.

-You just seemed very immersed.
-In what?

18
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:43,539
Oh. This, yes. Very.

19
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:45,584
He paints completely naked.

20
00:00:45,668 --> 00:00:49,797
Well, oil-based paint is really
hard to get out of most fabrics.

21
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:52,007

-How was Parsons?
-Very angry.

24
00:00:55,887 --> 00:00:57,721
I bought those paintings
right out from under him.

25
00:00:57,805 --> 00:00:59,473
-And this makes you happy?
-Extremely.

be his breakthrough.

36
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:23,039

-Do you hate him, too?

38

Should we take him out?

I go fuck up his drink?

Declan Howell is the most
famous unknown artist in the world.

223
00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:45,496
He's considered one of
the greats by his peers,

224
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,914
but he can't sell his art.

225

Well, won't sell his art, actually.

226

-He's crazy. Just won't do it.

And if someone ever
does talk him into a sale,

he always finds a way to get out of it.

229
00:08:55,131 --> 00:08:57,133
Early in his career, he
made a very big sale.

The day she came to pick it up,

231

he sets it on fire right in front of her,

232
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,432
and then puts the fire out by…

233
00:09:04,516 --> 00:09:06,350
Well, let's just say he did
not use a fire extinguisher.

that made any sense
to me at all: <i>Peanuts.</i>

237
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:16,278
There's a story, urban myth maybe,

238
00:09:16,362 --> 00:09:17,612
about a painting he painted.

239
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:19,072
It was supposed to be a masterpiece,

240
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:21,366
a thing of such beauty that,
when Jackson Pollock saw it,

241
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,660
he said he wasn't sure if
he would ever paint again.

242
00:09:23,744 --> 00:09:25,329
Nothing he could do could come close.

243
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:28,290
-Really? Have you seen it?
-No one's seen it but Pollock.

244
00:09:28,374 --> 00:09:30,167

-Six drinks.
