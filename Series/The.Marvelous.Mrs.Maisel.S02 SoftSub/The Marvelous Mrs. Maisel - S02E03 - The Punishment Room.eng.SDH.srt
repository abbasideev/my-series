-Only a goy dots the I's.
-I hope it's all there.

176
00:05:58,278 --> 00:05:59,778
The treasure map's in pretty bad shape.

177
00:05:59,862 --> 00:06:00,075

00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,071

she calls her records

179

marking where she put the money.

180
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:04,159
Ma, what… what are you looking for?

181
00:06:04,243 --> 00:06:06,286
I feel like I forgot something.

182
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,372
Moishe, did you bring the bag
of money we use to bribe people?

183
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:11,416
There's a bag of money
we use to bribe people.

184
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,834
A little louder, Ma.

185
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:14,419
I don't think they heard
you in Poughkeepsie.

186
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:15,712
Curren, that's not a name.

187
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:18,298
That's something you pour over rice.

188
00:06:18,382 --> 00:06:19,716
And, Pop, Mr. Cleary is
my buddy Archie's brother

189
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,509
and he's doing us a big favor here.

190
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:24,012
By taking our money?
I wish I could do someone that favor.

191
00:06:24,096 --> 00:06:26,806
-Mr. Curry, a question…
-Cleary. Cleary.

192
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,892
Is there gonna be another
Great Depression soon?

193
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:30,603
Is that something you can tell us?

194
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:32,647
If I could, I'd be the
president of the bank

195
00:06:32,731 --> 00:06:34,065
or the United States.

196
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:36,067
Step on enough Jews, you'll get there.

197
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:38,903
Now I remember. I found this.

198
00:06:38,987 --> 00:06:40,988
It was behind one of the radiators.

199
00:06:41,072 --> 00:06:42,949
Ma, you said you found all the money.

200
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:44,617
On the first treasure map.

201
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:47,787
I found two more treasure
maps this morning.

202
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:50,081
Oh, should we lock these up in the safe?

203
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:51,832
They show where all our stashes are.

204
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,543
-They're like gold.
-I'm in charge of these from now on.

205
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:56,880
Are we gonna be okay?

206
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:02,470
You… are not Jewish.

-WOMAN: It's a little plain.

-You know?
-Mm-hmm.

210
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,144
Yes, ma'am.
What's life without a little spark?

211
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:12,562
So, what do I do? How do I do that?

00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:14,355

bolder with the colors.

213

We have a gig tonight, remember?

Yes, but we were meeting at the club.

229
00:07:41,802 --> 00:07:42,927
This place is on the way.

It's 20 blocks out of your way.

-That, too.
-Susie.

We have a bunch of gigs coming up

there with my thumb up my ass.

I'm not always late.

239
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,531
Fine. We'll go together, under protest

240
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,242
because I do not appreciate
this lack of faith in my punctuality.

-VIVIAN: You got it.

-Thanks.

You're such a little freak.
I mean, you really are.

MIDGE: I want to get serious
here for a minute, people.

Nuclear war. The nightmare, the horror.

251

Oh, now, I'm not talking
about dying in one.

252
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:41,071
I'm talking about surviving and

Now, 6:53 and 30 seconds is next, right?

260
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,427
Maybe.

261
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:05,262
But I like to think that it may not be

262
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:07,014
and then be surprised when it is.

263
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:09,683
The suspense is intoxicating.

264
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:12,104
Oh, and I drink while I do this.

265

Did I not mention that?
I should've mentioned that.

266
00:09:14,273 --> 00:09:17,401
My son was bullied
the other day at the park

267
00:09:17,485 --> 00:09:20,695
and the anger I felt at that boy.

268
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:23,323
Not the boy picking on
my son, I mean my son.

00:09:49,017 --> 00:09:50,601
greatest drinking game ever.

A shot of vodka every time it goes beep.

284
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,355
Then I throw up on the half hour.

285
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:56,482
I should patent this. I should

bury the body. It's not pretty, son,

287
00:09:58,735 --> 00:10:00,445
but we can't leave a dead
four-year-old unburied like this.

Quick, look in my purse, there's a

government pamphlet I
read on this with guidelines.

00:10:12,124 --> 00:10:14,334
One was not to bring
anything into the fallout shelter

296
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:16,920
that would be unnaturally disturbing.

297
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:18,672
You realize what that means.

although he did not produce

688
00:25:31,952 --> 00:25:33,578
I think that's probably
all they stashed there.

689
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:35,580
They probably got nervous
about the noise the blade made.

690
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:37,249
One of the hazards of
secretly using power tools

691
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:38,417
in someone else's house.

692
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:40,836
-Kiss the kids for me?
-Okay.

693
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,212
-And hug them?
-Of course.

694
00:25:42,296 --> 00:25:43,380
And tell them I'll always love them?

695
00:25:43,464 --> 00:25:44,756
Joel, are you dying?

696
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,592
I've got to dig into Aunt
Golda's sub-basement tomorrow

697
00:25:46,676 --> 00:25:48,428
and there could be a
Komodo dragon guarding it.

698
00:25:48,512 --> 00:25:51,305
-Just get some sleep?
-I probably won't. Good night.

699
00:25:51,389 --> 00:25:53,975
Good night.

700
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,477
DORA: I've never drawn a nude man before.

701
00:25:56,561 --> 00:25:58,146
MILLY: I've never seen a nude man before.

702
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,814
Drawing a man's genitals is not easy.

703
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:01,107
Or appetizing.

704
00:26:01,191 --> 00:26:03,067
Did you draw a face on his penis?

705
00:26:03,151 --> 00:26:05,027
-No.
-It's smiling.

706
00:26:05,111 --> 00:26:07,864
-I draw what I see.
-Rose, let's see yours.

707
00:26:07,948 --> 00:26:09,866
Oh, I completely skipped
the down-there part.

708
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,409
It made me very uncomfortable.

709
00:26:11,493 --> 00:26:13,662
-Even though it was smiling?
-It's not smiling.

710
00:26:13,746 --> 00:26:15,622
I wouldn't submit that for
your master's thesis, Milly.

711
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:17,875
A master's degree,
that sounds so important.

712
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,877
-Are you all on that path?
-Pretty much.

713
00:26:19,961 --> 00:26:21,920
My, I can't even imagine.

714
00:26:22,004 --> 00:26:24,798
And once you have your
master's, what do you do with it?

715
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:27,509
-Pardon?
-I mean, it's so audacious, a master's.

716
00:26:27,593 --> 00:26:28,719
You're learning so much.

717
00:26:28,803 --> 00:26:30,762
What are you going to
do with all that knowledge?

718
00:26:30,846 --> 00:26:33,223
-What is she talking about?
-What do you do once you graduate?

719
00:26:33,307 --> 00:26:35,225
There's a lot of things we can do. Teach.

720
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:39,271
-Oh, yes, teach. Where?
-Here, I guess.

721
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:41,357
But none of the teachers here are women.

722
00:26:41,441 --> 00:26:42,817
They all seem to be men.

723
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:46,070
-I guess a lot of them are men.
-I think all of them are men.

724
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:47,322
I never put that together.

725
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:50,116
Some of us want to be artists.
I want to be an artist.

726
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,536
But there are really no
lady artists, not in the States.

727
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,331
I knew a couple back in the day in Paris.

728
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,708
One quit, no one knows
where she is today.

729
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,335
The other one killed herself.

730
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,378
Mainly because no one
would buy art from a girl.

731
00:27:02,462 --> 00:27:04,214
She tried calling herself
Bertrum and wearing a bowler,

732
00:27:04,298 --> 00:27:05,549
but it didn't work.

733
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:07,635
You don't like your sandwich?

734
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:09,053
I'm not hungry anymore.

735
00:27:09,137 --> 00:27:11,180
Some of you are doing this
to find a husband, I assume?

736
00:27:11,264 --> 00:27:12,890
That's why my daughter went to college.

737
00:27:12,974 --> 00:27:15,434
Oh, sure, she wanted to
make friends and take classes,

738
00:27:15,518 --> 00:27:18,812
but her real goal was to
meet a man, and she met one.

739
00:27:18,896 --> 00:27:21,315
Then he dumped her, so
she's working a low-level job

740
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:23,359
because all she had was a
degree in Russian literature,

741
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:24,652
but not a master's.

742
00:27:24,736 --> 00:27:27,696
I mean, it would be nice to meet a man.

743
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,073
Yeah, I guess.

744
00:27:29,157 --> 00:27:32,284
Well, if you want to meet a
man, this is not the place to do it.

745
00:27:32,368 --> 00:27:37,249
The art department, mm-mm.
The whole building, nope.

746
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,125
Now, the business
school, that's the place.

747
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:41,044
Lots of choices and they're
all studying something

748
00:27:41,128 --> 00:27:44,548
with real potential.

749
00:27:44,632 --> 00:27:47,217
I hope you don't mind the
thoughts of an older woman.

750
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:49,052
I'm just very new at all this.

751
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:51,137
Not at all.

752
00:27:51,221 --> 00:27:53,223
Yes, thank you, Rose.

753
00:27:57,394 --> 00:28:00,105
SUSIE: Mmm.
This place has the best pastrami, right?

754
00:28:00,189 --> 00:28:02,024
-See you, Susie.
-Yeah, see you, Louie.

755
00:28:02,108 --> 00:28:03,693
I don't know, Katz's is pretty good.

756
00:28:03,777 --> 00:28:05,778
Mm, I like Katz's for their corned beef.

757
00:28:05,862 --> 00:28:08,823
-Hey, Susie, call me tomorrow.
-Actually, Mel, can you call me?

758
00:28:08,907 --> 00:28:10,324
-Why?
-Just do it.

759
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:13,202
-Whatever.
-Mm, Greengrass for the lox.

760
00:28:13,286 --> 00:28:14,704
I grew up on Barney Greengrass.

761
00:28:14,788 --> 00:28:16,581
Don't tell me about Barney Greengrass.

762
00:28:16,665 --> 00:28:19,083
-Maybe the matzo ball soup.
-FRED: Hey, Susie.

763
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:20,918
That thing you did? That was real shitty.

764
00:28:21,002 --> 00:28:22,628
That's the joy of not
giving a shit, Freddy.

765
00:28:22,712 --> 00:28:24,297
You're just asking for reciprocation.

766
00:28:24,381 --> 00:28:26,507
-I'm asking you to sit down.
-Don't tell me to sit down!

767
00:28:26,591 --> 00:28:28,201
Fuck you and your reciprocation
and your two-dollar suits.

768
00:28:28,285 --> 00:28:28,802
No, no, fuck you…

769
00:28:28,886 --> 00:28:30,637
-You throw your weight around.
-And fuck your mother at the same time.

770
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:32,347
-You're nothing. You're a nobody.
-Just crawl back up her pussy

771
00:28:32,431 --> 00:28:34,516
-and shut the fuck up.
-Eat shit and die!

772
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,101
Nice guy, I'll introduce you later.

773
00:28:36,185 --> 00:28:38,937
He seemed very personable.

774
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:40,731
-Shit.
-What?

775
00:28:40,815 --> 00:28:42,482
You're not gonna
believe who else is here.

776
00:28:42,566 --> 00:28:43,859
-Who? Who?
-Harry Drake.

777
00:28:43,943 --> 00:28:45,777
-SUSIE: Harry Drake.
-MIDGE: Did he see us?

778
00:28:45,861 --> 00:28:47,237
He sees us now.

779
00:28:47,321 --> 00:28:49,323
He's coming over. Should I scream?

780
00:28:49,407 --> 00:28:51,533
-Why, are you having an orgasm?
-He threatened you, Susie.

781
00:28:51,617 --> 00:28:54,662
-Hello, Midge, Susie.
-Hey, Harry, nice to see you.

782
00:28:54,746 --> 00:28:56,080
How're you liking this weather?

783
00:28:56,164 --> 00:28:57,790
"Spring is sprung, the grass is riz…"

784
00:28:57,874 --> 00:28:59,250
"I wonder where the birdie is…"

785
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:01,169
Not that any of us get outside much.

786
00:29:01,253 --> 00:29:03,463
-Just enough to hop in a taxi.
-Lunch sometime?

787
00:29:03,547 --> 00:29:04,881
-Name the day.
-My treat.

788
00:29:04,965 --> 00:29:05,923
Yup. See you.

789
00:29:06,007 --> 00:29:08,843
-What the fuck?
-What?

790
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:11,095
When did you make up with Harry Drake?

791
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:12,221
I didn't.

792
00:29:12,305 --> 00:29:14,223
-Then what was that?
-That was showbiz.

793
00:29:14,307 --> 00:29:16,309
He's been threatening you with violence.

794
00:29:16,393 --> 00:29:18,269
That's showbiz, too.

795
00:29:18,353 --> 00:29:20,730
Oh, look who Harry's with now.
That's Billy Jay.

796
00:29:20,814 --> 00:29:22,191
He books the Upstairs at the Downstairs.

797
00:29:22,275 --> 00:29:23,817
I'd give my right nut
to get you in there.

798
00:29:23,901 --> 00:29:25,486
Yeah, that's on 56th.

799
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,738
That's 30 blocks above our last one.

800
00:29:27,822 --> 00:29:30,199
SUSIE: Billy Jay.
He never comes in here. Crap.

801
00:29:30,283 --> 00:29:31,992
Go talk to him.

802
00:29:32,076 --> 00:29:35,287
You don't just talk to
Billy Jay, you need an in.

803
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:36,955
Luckily, I got one.

804
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,874
Yeah? What?

805
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:42,544
His eye for the ladies.
Hmm? [CLICKS TONGUE]

806
00:29:42,628 --> 00:29:44,838
-Are you having a stroke?
-Get over there and do your thing.

807
00:29:44,922 --> 00:29:46,965
-What thing?
-The guy's a dog.

808
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:48,968
He'd fuck a corpse if it
was less than six hours old.

809
00:29:49,052 --> 00:29:50,303
Are you kidding me?

810
00:29:50,387 --> 00:29:52,389
I'm not gonna go over
there and make this guy think

811
00:29:52,473 --> 00:29:54,140
I'm gonna sleep with him if he books me.

812
00:29:54,224 --> 00:29:56,059
Why not? You have those weapons.

813
00:29:56,143 --> 00:29:58,853
-So do you.
-No, these are self-destructive.

814
00:29:58,937 --> 00:30:00,021
I wouldn't do something like that.

815
00:30:00,105 --> 00:30:01,439
Come on, you told me all about

816
00:30:01,523 --> 00:30:03,066
how you practically slept with a priest

817
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,943
so he'd give your friend
some pigs in a blanket

818
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:06,611
for her wedding, but
you're not gonna do this?

819
00:30:06,695 --> 00:30:09,280
That was just sweet talk.
It happened in the moment.

820
00:30:09,364 --> 00:30:11,783
Oh, so you're just against
being a premeditated slut.

821
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:14,285
You're fine being a spontaneous slut.

822
00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:16,372
I'm not sidling up to Billy Jay.

823
00:30:16,456 --> 00:30:18,916
Okay. Don't.

824
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,836
But we do have to make
some money at some point.

825
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,796
-You understand that, right?
-Yes, I understand that.

826
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,465
-Like, now.
-Don't worry about me, I'm fine.

827
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:30,177
Oh, are you, Princess?
You hanging in there?

828
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:33,097
Is life okay in your 18-room
apartment on the Upper West Side

829
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:35,224
with your doorman and
your maid and your childcare

830
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:36,934
and your bottomless closet?

831
00:30:37,018 --> 00:30:39,937
Oh, I forgot to tell you, I
found $2,000 in my closet.

832
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:41,355
[QUIETLY] This is what I'm talking about.

833
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,984
I'm not gonna find $2,000 in my closet.

834
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:47,028
Think about my life for a moment.
I'm broke.

835
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:50,365
I'm working less at the Gaslight
so I'm falling further behind.

836
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:51,700
I'm begging people to call me

837
00:30:51,784 --> 00:30:53,535
'cause I can't afford to call them.

838
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,871
I am picking up half-eaten
apples out of trash cans

839
00:30:55,955 --> 00:30:57,956
at the Port Authority.
It's getting dire here.

840
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,125
Then I'll pay your phone bill.
How about that?

841
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:01,334
It's 46 bucks.

842
00:31:01,418 --> 00:31:04,129
Oh. That I would have
to borrow from my father.

843
00:31:04,213 --> 00:31:05,672
Yeah, from the father
that doesn't have any idea

844
00:31:05,756 --> 00:31:07,382
why you'd be paying
the phone bill of a friend

845
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,051
that he's never met that you're
not even supposed to know.

846
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:10,052
Great plan.

847
00:31:10,136 --> 00:31:11,637
You know,

848
00:31:11,721 --> 00:31:13,473
don't worry about me, I'll be fine.

849
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:16,476
I get it. Okay? I… I'm lucky.

850
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,061
I have a support system, you don't.
I'm sorry.

851
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:21,522
Don't be sorry. Forget I said anything.

852
00:31:21,606 --> 00:31:23,483
No, Susie, it's good for me to know.
