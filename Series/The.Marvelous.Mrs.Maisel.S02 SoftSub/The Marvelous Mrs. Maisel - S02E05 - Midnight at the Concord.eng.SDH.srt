which I soon discovered
is one look I cannot pull off.

Then, right before I
fucked up Simon Says,

214
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:42,481
I had to rush back to the cottage to get

I'm hanging out in the
woods trying to find you a gig.

227
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:03,711
Very similar to what I do back
in New York, but with ticks.

turn around for a second

232
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:16,433

my plunger and uses it.

234
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:18,727

-Oh, boy.
-I play to win.

344
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:19,769
And to win, I need information.

345
00:12:19,853 --> 00:12:21,354
I need to determine my best angles,

347
00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:25,733

There is no wind resistance.

All right, thank you for
explaining that to me,

but I have to insist that you
stop yelling into two telephones

414
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:55,514
because, clearly, yelling
into one isn't enough

415
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:57,516

00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,479

-Yes, they will.

1178
00:44:06,334 --> 00:44:07,918
So it might be tough
to gauge how it's going.

1179
00:44:08,002 --> 00:44:09,503
Hold a little longer for the laughs

1180
00:44:09,587 --> 00:44:11,171
and look down at who you
can see in the audience.

00:44:11,255 --> 00:44:13,006
If they're smilin', you're doing good.

00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,425

Thank you very much.

1192

Here we are in the
Catskills, and I'm starving.

1193
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:41,369
Where can you get a
decent meal around here?

1194
00:44:41,453 --> 00:44:43,079
-[LAUGHTER]
-Food.

1195
00:44:43,163 --> 00:44:46,709
Food. Twenty-four hours a day, food.

1196
00:44:46,793 --> 00:44:48,335
Shouldn't the Catskills
season be in winter,

1197
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,754
with big coats and scarves?

1198
00:44:50,838 --> 00:44:52,923
What kind of sadists
feed you ten meals a day,

1199
00:44:53,007 --> 00:44:54,341
then tell you to put on a fucking bikini

1200
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:55,426
and go find a husband?

1201
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:57,386
The only reason

1202
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:00,097
we stand a chance is because
the men are too full to run.

1203
00:45:00,181 --> 00:45:03,100
And all I see

1204
00:45:03,184 --> 00:45:06,562
and hear about and dream about is food.

1205
00:45:06,646 --> 00:45:08,105
Giant portions of food.

1206
00:45:08,189 --> 00:45:09,941
I know it's the midnight show.

1207
00:45:10,025 --> 00:45:12,277
I'm supposed to be talking
about blow jobs and big tits,

1208
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:14,821
but, after six weeks up here,

1209
00:45:14,905 --> 00:45:15,989
tits just start to look like a couple

1210

1211
00:45:18,033 --> 00:45:22,495
They're, uh… Oh, you've had them.

1212
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:26,124
But, really, I… I have great
affection for the mountains.

1213
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:28,376
I've been coming up here
with my family since I was born.

1214
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,713
It is the best place to have
your first nervous breakdown.

1215
00:45:31,797 --> 00:45:33,965
Which automatically
comes with spending months

1216
00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:36,469
in a cabin with your family
every year since you were born.

1217

My first everything
happened in the Catskills.

1218

Everything.

1219
00:45:41,808 --> 00:45:43,893
My mother first told me
to keep my knees closed

1220
00:45:43,977 --> 00:45:45,895
until there's a ring on
my finger in the Catskills.

1221
00:45:45,979 --> 00:45:48,731
Actually, she told me it
was biologically impossible

1222
00:45:48,815 --> 00:45:50,733
to have sex without
a ring on your finger.

1223
00:45:50,817 --> 00:45:54,028
Guess what, Mom, it's not.

1224
00:45:54,112 --> 00:45:56,447
Anyhow, the first boy I ever kissed

1225
00:45:56,531 --> 00:45:58,616
I kissed in the Catskills.

1226
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,953
Mm-hmm. First time I ever let
a boy go Christopher Columbus

1227
00:46:02,037 --> 00:46:04,915
on my nether regions,
it was in the Catskills.

1228
00:46:04,999 --> 00:46:09,544
And this boy, he was my… Papa.

1232

Things happen in the Catskills.

1233
00:46:20,765 --> 00:46:22,766
All kinds of things happen.

1234
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,686
Games. There's games.
You like games? I like games.

1235
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:26,938
And… And when people
come up here with kids,

1236
00:46:27,022 --> 00:46:28,606
they want things for the kids to play

1237
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:31,442
so the adults can go… be adults.

1238
00:46:31,526 --> 00:46:32,860
Parents don't really want
to know what's going on

1239
00:46:32,944 --> 00:46:34,529
with their kids behind their backs.

1240
00:46:34,613 --> 00:46:36,447
I mean, they'd prefer
they weren't eaten by a lion

1241
00:46:36,531 --> 00:46:38,700
or whatever eats people
in Upstate New York,

1242
00:46:38,784 --> 00:46:40,910
but, otherwise, secrets.

1243
00:46:40,994 --> 00:46:43,621
Secrets. Kids have secrets.

Mothers and daughters and
daughters and fathers and…

1245
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:49,712
You know, it's weird with
daughters and fathers, isn't it?

1246
00:46:49,796 --> 00:46:51,130
Isn't it weird?

1247
00:46:51,214 --> 00:46:53,173
I… Is it weird?

1248
00:46:53,257 --> 00:46:56,051
Is it? Fucking make up your mind.

1249
00:46:56,135 --> 00:46:58,303
Because fathers never really
know who their daughters are.

1250
00:46:58,387 --> 00:47:00,139
They don't want to know, do they?

1251
00:47:00,223 --> 00:47:02,474
It would be terrifying to know
who they are and what they do,

1252
00:47:02,558 --> 00:47:03,976
and… and, because they
don't really know any of this,

1253
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,644
sometimes they can
just walk in unexpectedly,

1254
00:47:05,728 --> 00:47:06,770
and, suddenly, it's like,

1255
00:47:06,854 --> 00:47:08,188
"Hey, you're a whore. Who knew?"

1256
00:47:08,272 --> 00:47:09,940
Not that I'm a whore.

ticket to a Sinatra concert.

1263

Even my mother would
give it up for a Sinatra ticket.

1264
00:47:26,959 --> 00:47:28,835
No, she wouldn't.
My mother wouldn't give it up

Well, my father.
She'll… She'll give it up to him.

1267

I mean, not that she told
me she'd give it up to him.

But I'm assuming. Well, I'm here,

to somebody at some point.

saying the word "sex."

I actually have never
said "sex" this much before.

1276
00:47:51,609 --> 00:47:53,569
I don't think I've ever
said the word "sex" in front

1277
00:47:53,653 --> 00:47:55,905

1280

and a scowl of intellectual superiority

1281
00:48:02,328 --> 00:48:04,498
because he is intellectually superior.

1282
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:06,124
He is very smart.

1283
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:08,460

that she pictured having sex

1284

with his mind on their wedding night

1285
00:48:10,045 --> 00:48:11,922
so she didn't have to
think about his penis.

1286
00:48:12,006 --> 00:48:13,924
She did not say that.
Some other woman said that.

1287
