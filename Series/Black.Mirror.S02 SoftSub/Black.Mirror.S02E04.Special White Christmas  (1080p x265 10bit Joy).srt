Well, she's off. OK.

174
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,280
Gonna be a challenge.
Don't quit.

175
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,480
Let's let our friend Amy here
yadder on for a little while

176
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,640
and then, uh,
find an excuse to slip away.

balcony till, like, four in the morning.</i>

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,040
<i>[HARRY] Yeah?
It's startling.</i>

179
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,640
Listen, I've just go
to the, um, little boys' room.

180
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,400
So, uh, just keep the party
going and I'll,

181
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,240
- you know... [LAUGHS]
- Sure.

182
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,960
Do you actually have to go?

183
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,200
<i>Yeah, but it's not
easy with you watching.</i>

184
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,200
I promise. I won't peek.

185
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,760
So you streamed everything he
saw, and he trusted you with that?

186
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,720
Well...
it was only me watching.

187
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,000
<i>Jesus, how much urine? He's
pissing like a harpooned cow.</i>

[MAN] Well, it is!

190
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,880
OK, there's our girl.
Um, all right, Harry.

191
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,760
Your best bet is to just go over
and start talking to her.

192
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,800
<i>You just want
to establish a rapport.</i>

193
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,400
<i>OK? Don't be scared of her.</i>

194
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,640
OK, guys, any observations so
far, helping our man out here?

195
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,680
<i>Here's what's interesting, she's
pretty but, uh, no one's hitting on her.</i>

196
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,360
<i>[MAN 1] Probably means
they've given up.</i>

197
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,400
<i>[MAN 2] She always gives them
the brush-off cos...</i>

198
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,120
<i>They're regular types, she's an
outsider with zero in common.</i>

199
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,320
- OK that's a possible in.
- [EXHALES]

200
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,280
<i>Harry, engage in conversation,
but be cynical.</i>

201
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,840
Right? Cutting.

202
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,680
<i>Like Bonnie and Clyde, huh?
You two against the world.</i>

203
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,400
Confidence. Confidence.
Just talk to her.

204
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
I don't really get parties.

205
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,000
You know, you just kind of turn up
and it's, uh, it's enforced fun, all night.

206
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,000
Talk about what TV shows
you've fallen behind on.

207
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,320
Pretend to be happy.
[SCOFFS]

208
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,240
Maybe everyone else enjoys it,
maybe it's just me?

209
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,480
<i>It's definitely not just you.</i>

210
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,560
All right, good start. Now do
some more outsider small talk.

211
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,120
<i>And keep looking at her.
I need to gauge her reactions.</i>

212
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,720
So I noticed you sitting
alone on the edge and I, uh...

213
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,120
I thought,
"Hey, kindred spirit."

214
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,560
I really hate when people say
"kindred spirit", you know.

215
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,880
And people that do that.

216
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,200
- Me too.
- [CHUCKLES]

217
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,680
Yeah, I guess you don't
really like parties either.

218
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,680
The noise wrecks it for me.

219
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,400
<i>All the talking and talking,
it never fucking stops.</i>

220
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,480
OK, she curses, so should you.

221
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,040
Shit, fucking, I fucking always totally
think that it's fucking shit. You know?

222
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,080
I can't think through
all the babble.

223
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
I only got through it last year
because I was on drugs.

224
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,040
[LAUGHS]

225
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,840
I'm sorry, what's that?
What's that?

226
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,640
Just, like, pills, but

227
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,400
<i>they must've been pretty strong
because I actually enjoyed myself.</i>

228
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,440
- That's cool.
- Don't say cool.

229
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,960
- I wish I had some drugs right now.
- No, you don't.

230
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,640
I'm just... I'm joking.

231
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,400
<i>I don't take them anymore.</i>

232
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,840
- Say, "That's good."
- That's good, because you don't...

233
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,840
<i>You don't need that
shit in your system, no.</i>

234
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,080
<i>I'd say she's a level four
rock chick.</i>

235
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,160
<i>Semi-reformed. Probably respond
well to spiritual conversation.</i>

236
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,240
<i>I don't think I can face fucking
weeks of that. I might bail, boys.</i>

237
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,200
OK, look, it's too public here.

238
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,160
Ask if you can move someplace
quieter, where you can really talk.

239
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,280
People want to be heard. That's why
90 percent of seduction is just listening.

240
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,360
[MAN] Or at least pulling
a face like you're listening.

241
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,880
Yeah, that works, too.

242
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,960
The important thing
is to make them feel important.

243
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,960
Like they can make you want to
extinguish the rest of the world

244
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,360
and focus on them.

245
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,400
Full attention.

246
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,520
Like you're not giving me now.
What's wrong?

247
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,080
- That clock.
- What about it?

248
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,800
I just... I just never
noticed it before.

249
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,800
[SCOFFS] In five years? Jesus.

250
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,640
Anyway, the point is to stay
locked in on them long enough

251
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,480
to build a rapport.

252
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,320
So, well, I would guess
that either every guy in there

253
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,160
has already tried to hit on you or, uh,
maybe they find you too intimidating.

254
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,960
- Am I intimidating?
- No, no, no, no, no. I'm just, uh...

255
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,600
No, I just imagine that they all
kind of want to get in inside your...

256
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,800
- Head.
- ...head.

257
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,400
[CHUCKLES]
Some of them have tried.

258
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,480
Not directly.

259
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,320
They send messages, or they make
it so you know what they're thinking.

260
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,920
Yeah. That can't be fun.

261
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,440
It's just tiring, you know.
It just doesn't end, ever.

262
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,960
<i>[HARRY] I wouldn't know,
I never hit on anyone.</i>

263
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,760
<i>- [JENNIFER] Really?</i>
- OK, uh...

264
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,240
- Ask her how long she's
worked there. <i>- Um...</i>

265
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,640
<i>[HARRY] How long
have you worked for...</i>

266
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,120
- Magson Frank.
- ...Magson Frank.

267
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,480
- Three years. - Oh, wow.
So three Christmas parties.

268
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,720
This will be my last.

269
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,720
- Oh, really? Are you leaving?
- Mm-hm.

270
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,120
I've been planning it forever,
but you know what it's like.

271
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
You know you have to do it, but
when it comes right down to it,

272
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,080
it's hard
to work up the courage.

273
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,240
You can empathize with that.

274
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,520
Yeah. It's like when you want
to jump into a pool,

275
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,320
and you're worried that
the water's going to be cold.

276
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,520
But you know moments after you
jump in that it'll be fine.

277
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,000
It's the fear of the shock
that holds you back.

278
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,840
Ultimately, the only thing you're
worried about is the transition

279
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,040
from one state to another.

280
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,800
And that can't hurt you because
it's... it's just a state change.

281
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,480
Great stuff, kid.
Almost word-for-word.

282
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,520
That's exactly right,
it's just a state change.

283
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,240
Right. And it's
frustrating because

284
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,760
you've always got these ten voices
in your head saying, "Don't do it"

285
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,240
and another ten in your head
saying, "Do it".

286
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,400
Which one do you listen to?

287
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,720
The "do it"s.

288
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,520
Really?

289
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,760
Yeah. If you don't like it, you
can just cut and run, you know.

290

us... Telling me what to do.

I just want to talk to her
myself. And it's...

It's a bit of a head-fuck. I
kind of want you all to go away.
