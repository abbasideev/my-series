1
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:47,300
-I'm worried that's gonna hit the ceiling.
-We always get a tall one.

2
00:00:47,383 --> 00:00:49,342
Not taller than the living room.

3
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,508
Let's go back to the other one
and stand next to it.

4
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:57,008
Hey, Sally.

5
00:00:58,133 --> 00:00:59,133
Sally.

6
00:01:00,675 --> 00:01:01,675
Hello.

7
00:01:02,675 --> 00:01:04,008
It's Glen.

8
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:05,508
I know that.

9
00:01:05,592 --> 00:01:08,175
Well, you all just walked right by me
when you came in.

10
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:09,675
Sorry.

11
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:12,508
What are you doing back here?

12
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:16,008
My mom got married
and now I'm supposed to live with him.

13
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:19,133
I saw your new dad.
My mom said that would happen.

14
00:01:21,258 --> 00:01:23,425
After they're married a while,
they'll have a baby.

15
00:01:23,508 --> 00:01:25,175
You should probably
ask for something big now.

16
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:29,467
Hi. Are you getting a tree?

17
00:01:29,842 --> 00:01:31,467
No, I'm working.

18
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,258
What do you do?

19
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:34,675
I bring twine over.

20
00:01:35,258 --> 00:01:36,883
I get to cut it.

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,925
Wow.

22
00:01:39,342 --> 00:01:40,675
Yeah, I made it.

23
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:42,717
Those are good colors.

24
00:01:43,592 --> 00:01:45,633
We're leaving as soon as I find you.

25
00:01:46,675 --> 00:01:47,925
Bye, Glen.

26
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:49,675
Maybe I'll call you.

27
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:02,842
-Good time, bad time?
-Yes.

28
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:08,633
You've got a résumé
from the girl you met at the Ziegfeld Theater.

29
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:09,967
File it.

30
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,550
AI Weaver at Johnson Wax
requested another print of Glo-Coat.

31
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:17,508
And you got this very important
piece of mail.

32
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:24,008
Open it.

33
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:30,675
"Dear Daddy, Bobby thinks
this is going to the North Pole,

34
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:34,508
"but we should keep up the roos."
R-double-O-S.

35
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:36,592
Too much television.

36
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:40,300
"Bobby says that he knows
he doesn't deserve a Heathkit radio

37
00:02:40,383 --> 00:02:43,800
"because of what happened with leaving
the freezer open in the garage,

38
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:48,300
"but maybe Santa could choose
from a bicycle, a better pellet gun,

39
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:52,383
"a clock radio, a transistor radio,
a drum set and a bicycle."

40
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,592
I left that freezer open.

41
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:59,217
"Baby Gene wants a fireman.
I don't know what that means."

42
00:02:59,717 --> 00:03:03,258
it's adorable.
"And I would like the gold necklace

43
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:06,425
"that you can put your initials on
that we saw at Macy's.

44
00:03:06,508 --> 00:03:11,258
"And most of all, I'd like you to be here
on Christmas morning to give it to me,

45
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:13,425
"but I know you can't be."

46
00:03:18,508 --> 00:03:19,508
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:22,342 --> 00:03:28,800
So, a drum set, a fire truck,
the necklace is $30

48
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:31,508
and it's SBD, Sally Beth Draper.

49
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:42,342
And, get her some Beatles 45s
and him a transistor radio, too.

50
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:47,758
The girls went to Joan
and I don't want to undermine her,

51
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:51,425
but are we allowed to bring a friend
to the Christmas party?

52
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,508
Lane scaled it back to a glass of gin
and a box of Velveeta.

53
00:03:57,467 --> 00:03:58,675
We're tightening our belts.

54
00:03:59,842 --> 00:04:03,550
But you will be getting a bonus,
even if I have to see to it myself.

55
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:05,508
Well, thank you.

56
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:09,092
I didn't want to have to write a letter
to Santa.

57
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:11,800
-Do you want this?
-Sure.

58
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:18,342
Send him in.

59
00:04:21,758 --> 00:04:23,800
Ready Freddy.

60
00:04:23,883 --> 00:04:26,717
-it's been too long.
-No, just long enough.

61
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,925
You look good. Have a seat.

62
00:04:29,842 --> 00:04:32,467
Jeez. It looks like an Italian hospital in here.

63
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,342
I know, I know. Jane got a decorator.

64
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:38,133
I feel like with my hair,
you can't even see me in here.

65
00:04:38,217 --> 00:04:40,758
-Something brown?
-Maybe later,

66
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:42,633
What time is it? Look at that.

67
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,925
So, I thought it'd be best
if I broached this opportunity in person.

68
00:04:47,342 --> 00:04:50,425
Well, don't be fooled by the setup here.
It's Potemkinville.

69
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:52,092
Well, maybe I can help.

70
00:04:53,008 --> 00:04:55,592
I walked out of JWT
with a present under my arm.

71
00:04:56,258 --> 00:05:00,550
Pond's Cold Cream. It's $2 million,
but they'll never even notice it's gone.

72
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,842
How the hell did you do that?

73
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:06,842
Suffice it to say
the client and I are in a fraternity together.

74
00:05:08,592 --> 00:05:12,508
I can't handle the account myself,
but I'm clean and sober now.

75
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,383
Sixteen months without a drop.

76
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,592
So when you said, "Maybe later"...“'___

77
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:18,467
What am I gonna say?

78
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,342
Look, if it doesn't work out,
you can keep the account.

79
00:05:22,342 --> 00:05:25,133
What am I gonna say? Yes.

80
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:28,383
There is one little caveat.

81
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:29,675
Name it.

82
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:33,508
I feel like I'm getting sucked into that thing.

83
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:39,133
I don't want Pete Campbell near this.
I was surprised you took him along.

84
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,675
No comment.

85
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,675
Sugarberry has been selling hams
for 30 years at a fairly steady rate

86
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:50,092
while doing everything they could
to create sales,

87
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:52,092
and then we do this in a month.

88
00:05:52,175 --> 00:05:53,758
We have to give them time to reconcile that.

89
00:05:55,258 --> 00:05:56,258
Freddy!

90
00:05:56,508 --> 00:05:57,508
Ballerina.

91
00:06:00,717 --> 00:06:02,425
I feel like the Tin Man.

92
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:04,217
-Good to see you.
-Yeah.

93
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:06,008
How are you, Freddy?

94
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:09,300
Couldn't be better.
I was just talking about you.

95
00:06:10,842 --> 00:06:14,175
Freddy here just ran in from the yard
with a $2-million account in his mouth.

96
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:15,258
Pond's Cold Cream.

97
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,092
Well, that explains why you look so good.

98
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:22,092
A little early for that, isn't it, Don?

99
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,092
Very funny.

100
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:27,425
The pedigree of this account
is that it was boosted

101
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:30,592
and I'll need to maintain
my personal contact to it creatively,

102
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:32,342
if that's all right with you, Don.

103
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:34,342
If you don't mind working
with this old thing over here.

104
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:35,508
I was counting on it.

105
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:37,383
None for me.

106
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:43,050
When can you bring them in?

107
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:45,550
I'll be handling this one, Pete.

108
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:52,758
Well, Freddy, I hate to bring this up,
but I do believe it's on everyone's mind.

109
00:06:52,842 --> 00:06:55,883
We all want to know if you can be Santa
at the Christmas party.

110
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,175
It's the role I was born to play.

111
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,425
Francis residence.

112
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:09,550
Can Sally come to the phone?

113
00:07:09,883 --> 00:07:11,467
Who may I say is calling?

114
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,383
Stanley. I have a question about homework.

115
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:18,800
Sally, there's a young man
on the phone, Stanley.

116
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:22,717
Hello?

117
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:24,133
It's Glen.

118
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:25,675
Hi.

119
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,550
Don't you wanna know
why I said my name is Stanley?

120
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:30,592
I guess.

121
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:33,133
Because this is private.

122
00:07:37,675 --> 00:07:38,675
Where are you?

123
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,800
Where do you think?
I'm down the street at my mom's.

124
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,633
How come you didn't move?

125
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,800
I don't know.

126
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:53,592
But I hate it here. I really, really do.

127
00:07:54,092 --> 00:07:55,175
Why?

128
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:57,383
I won't tell anybody.

129
00:07:59,217 --> 00:08:03,467
Every time I go around a corner,
I keep thinking I'll see my dad.

130
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,883
Sorry. They're not gonna
get back together, you know.

131
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,258
Glen?

132
00:08:09,342 --> 00:08:11,592
Especially now that she's doing it
with somebody else.

133
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,050
Doing what?

134
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:14,175
Glen!

135
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:18,133
Well, don't worry. One day,
they'll wake up and they'll want to move.

136
00:08:18,217 --> 00:08:20,175
You'll see. I gotta go. Bye.

137
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:22,217
Goodbye.

138
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:26,633
Who's Stanley?

139
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,217
A boy.

140
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:33,508
We will soon be charging clients
for this service

141
00:08:33,592 --> 00:08:35,800
and Dr. Atherton will in turn be charging us.

142
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,467
Significantly less.

143
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:40,925
Bert and I have been meaning
to work together for years.

144
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:42,800
Out in the open at least.

145
00:08:43,258 --> 00:08:44,758
Very good, then. Shall we dim the lights?

146
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:48,842
No, beginning the presentation
with the film is a mistake.

147
00:08:48,925 --> 00:08:51,842
Audiences will listen to anything
in anticipation.

148
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:53,425
See what I was talking about?

149
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:56,467
Simply said, we believe
that at the motivational research group,

150
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,967
we have brought the science
of consumer evaluation

151
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,383
to a point of precision
like that of a surgeon's scalpel.

152
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,925
No doubt, with the help of minds
like Dr. Faye Miller,

153
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:08,258
with whose work you are already
unknowingly familiar.

154
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:11,175
Faye helped develop the indelible image

155
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:14,300
that has become the standard
of feminine hygiene advertising,

156
00:09:14,842 --> 00:09:17,717
the carefree gal in white pants.

157
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:23,758
It's right up there with the polio vaccine.

158
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:30,800
Beyond demographic information,
salary, age, marital situation,

159
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:34,342
we've tried to find a way to select prospects
who can really provide insight.

160
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:36,508
This test is our beginning.

161
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:40,717
Take a minute, fill it out
and please, take a cookie.

162
00:09:41,592 --> 00:09:43,008
What's it mean if we don't?

163
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:45,342
That you're a psychopath.

164
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:52,633
The point of this exercise
is to familiarize you with our methods.

165
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:57,342
The point of the cookies is that
everyone should be rewarded for their time.

166
00:09:58,008 --> 00:10:02,300
These questions have been designed
to get at what subjects really want

167
00:10:02,383 --> 00:10:04,425
instead of what they say they do.

168
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:07,717
What are the real feelings
that exist below the surface?

169
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:12,050
For example,
"How would you describe your father?"

170
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:16,300
No matter what the answer, it creates
a level of intimacy for the next question,

171
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:19,175
"Who makes decisions in your household?"

172
00:10:20,342 --> 00:10:21,717
There's some pencils if you need them.

173
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,425
I apologize. I have an appointment.

174
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:49,758
That is yours to keep.

175
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:53,383
Is that work?

176
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,258
No, it's me. It's kind of silly.

177
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:58,383
Tell me when they pull the curtains
so I can get out of here.

178
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:00,342
-Do you want ice?
-Yes.

179
00:11:11,717 --> 00:11:12,717
What are you doing?

180
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,300
Saint Vincent's junior staff Christmas party.

181
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:18,550
At 8:00 in the morning?

182
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:20,592
Well, the shift just ended
and we have to do it soon

183
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:24,342
because Christmas and New Year's,
we're overrun with suicides.

184
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:26,008
Well...

185
00:11:26,842 --> 00:11:30,342
Phoebe. And you're Don. I know.

186
00:11:30,592 --> 00:11:32,217
I hope we haven't met.

187
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,800
Well, I'm right across the hall.
We wave to each other.

188
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:38,967
You met my friend Sarah.
She fell on the stairs.

189
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:41,508
Maybe you weren't in uniform.

190
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,508
Don't pretend that you've never noticed me.

191
00:11:45,883 --> 00:11:49,258
You always grunt when
you put your Keys in the door.

192
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:53,008
It's not good, which is why
I am inviting you to my party.

193
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,967
I really appreciate the invitation, Phoebe,
but I'm late for work.

194
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,675
So you should thank me for waking you.

195
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:08,592
Tallulah Bankhead, she's glamorous.

196
00:12:08,675 --> 00:12:10,717
She seems more uncompromising
than a movie star,

197
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,217
you know, because she's on Broadway.

198
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:14,800
She never got off Broadway
because she's not beautiful enough.

199
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:17,383
Shame on you. Come on.

200
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:19,633
A little backstage at the makeup mirror
with Pond's,

201
00:12:19,717 --> 00:12:23,800
a big bouquet of roses, opening night.
"The choice of professionals."

202
00:12:23,883 --> 00:12:25,175
It's good, right?

203
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,175
All of their research says
that they're trying to get young women.

204
00:12:31,675 --> 00:12:33,425
Well, young women look up to older women.

205
00:12:33,717 --> 00:12:36,342
For beauty tips? Are you joking?

206
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:39,925
I know the client. This thing is rigged.
That's what he wants.

207
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:41,800
It's not just about the client.

208
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:44,425
People are looking at everything we do here.

209
00:12:44,508 --> 00:12:47,133
Have you seen our work?
It's very different than this.

210
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:48,592
Frederick van Rumsen!

211
00:12:48,675 --> 00:12:49,675
Von.

212
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:54,383
Boy, oh, boy, were you missed at lunch.
Cal Rutledge from Pond's. What a cut-up.

213
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:57,842
-What do you mean?
-I mean I gotta go lay down.

214
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:07,383
I can't believe that's his job.

215
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:14,675
Hello. Could you tell him
Mr. Rumsen's on the phone?

216
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:17,633
-Interrupt him.
-What's wrong?

217
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,050
Calvin, do you have anything to tell me?

218
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:28,342
Did you just have lunch
with Roger Sterling?

219
00:13:29,092 --> 00:13:31,175
So you have nothing to say?

220
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:34,925
Hey, hey, don't do that. it's okay.

221
00:13:37,342 --> 00:13:38,800
Pull yourself together.

222
00:13:40,842 --> 00:13:43,633
First Baptist Church, 79th and Broadway.

223
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:47,592
I gotta go.

224
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:49,300
Is everything okay?

225
00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:51,508
What, you can't put two and two together?

226
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:56,550
Listen, cutie, wrap your head around
finding the right famous face

227
00:13:56,633 --> 00:13:58,925
or my other thing about the T-zone.

228
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:02,758
I want 10 tags apiece, then I narrow it down
and then we go to Don.

229
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,800
Are you serious?

230
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:10,175
I'll do them, too. Don't worry, I'm sure
yours will be better because you're girlier.

231
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,800
Lee Garner Jr

232
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,883
Put him through.

233
00:14:21,467 --> 00:14:23,508
Caroline, did he say what it was about?

234
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:29,717
Well, hello, Lee. How's Palm Beach?

235
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:32,550
Beautiful. Heading back there
in a couple of days.

236
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,008
Back? Where the hell are you?

237
00:14:34,217 --> 00:14:36,717
In town doing a little Christmas shopping.

238
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:39,133
Yeah, I'd love to see you
now that I Know you're in town.

239
00:14:39,217 --> 00:14:40,217
Caroline!

240
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,592
-How about dinner tomorrow?
-Christmas party.

241
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:47,508
How about lunch?
We're having a Christmas party.

242
00:14:47,883 --> 00:14:50,050
Why am I getting my invitation so late?

243
00:14:50,258 --> 00:14:52,300
Because I thought you were out of town.

244
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:56,383
Madison Avenue office Christmas party?
I've seen the movies. You find me.

245
00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:59,675
-Okay. 3200?
-No. 4:00.

246
00:14:59,758 --> 00:15:01,842
5:00. Shit. Go, get Lane.

247
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:04,967
I'm looking forward to it.

248
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:07,217
You won't be disappointed.

249
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:17,717
I just got off the phone with Lee Garner Jr.
He's going to stop by.

250
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,300
We're gonna have to have
a Christmas party, a real one.

251
00:15:20,383 --> 00:15:22,258
-How did that happen?
-It happened.

252
00:15:22,342 --> 00:15:25,342
In fact, he was offended
that we hadn't invited him already.

253
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,717
Uninvite him. Take him to the Four Seasons.
He can have three entrees.

254
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,842
This man doesn't care about food.

255
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,633
I know that you've lived your life
from a bottomless pocket,

256
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:41,508
but there's a very real system of money
coming in versus money going out.

257
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:48,008
Overtime, supplies being used carelessly,
leaving the lights on, parties, it adds up.

258
00:15:48,092 --> 00:15:51,092
Listen, Olivier, aren't you
the one who's always talking about how

259
00:15:51,175 --> 00:15:53,508
Lucky Strike is 99%
of our business or something?

260
00:15:53,925 --> 00:15:56,383
69% if we land Pond's Cold Cream.

261
00:15:56,467 --> 00:16:00,050
We have Pond's and I hate the way you say
"percent," you know that?

262
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:01,675
What about our other clients?

263
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:03,592
We have no other clients.

264
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:09,383
If Lee Garner Jr. wants three wise men
flown in from Jerusalem, he gets it.

265
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:12,050
Caroline! Get Jeanie in here.

266
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,258
You want something?
I brought it from home.

267
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:19,717
Yes?

268
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,383
There's been a small adjustment
to the scale of our Christmas party.

269
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:24,550
Lower or higher?

270
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:27,175
Lee Garner Jr. will be joining us.

271
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:29,342
I trust you'll make
the appropriate improvements.

272
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:34,133
Well, I don't. We need to change its rating
from convalescent home to Roman orgy.

273
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,300
Maalox.

274
00:16:42,008 --> 00:16:45,758
I want a bartender and a tree. Screw him.
I love Christmas.

275
00:16:45,842 --> 00:16:46,967
You love Christmas parties.

276
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:51,425
We're going to need more employees,
so I'm going to allow everyone escorts,

277
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:52,550
even the girls.

278
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:56,800
New York food, deli and Chinese,
and some kind of gift for Mr. Garner.

279
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,342
You're off-limits.

280
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:00,883
I don't think he's the one
who needs to be reminded.

281
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,925
Come on. He was all over you
the time you wore that red dress,

282
00:17:05,008 --> 00:17:07,758
the one with the bow in the back
that makes you look like a present.

283
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:09,092
You have an incredible memory.

284
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:12,217
Yeah, I think about it a lot.
That dress, I mean.

285
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,758
-Could you wear it?
-Stop it.

286
00:17:15,842 --> 00:17:17,842
I didn't mean it that way.

287
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:22,258
All I was saying was this is the office
and that's life.

288
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:25,133
And this is good and that's life.

289
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:35,967
What a nice surprise.

290
00:17:36,842 --> 00:17:39,258
Sheila at the Station baked Them.

291
00:17:39,342 --> 00:17:41,508
Sheila. Who's Sheila?

292
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,842
She's 60 years old.
You see how shaky the icing is?

293
00:17:52,675 --> 00:17:54,842
Hey, knock it off.

294
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:57,925
-Why? ls Rasputin home?
-She'll hear you.

295
00:17:58,883 --> 00:18:00,800
I want to lie down. I'm tired.

296
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:05,300
-My bed is covered with work.
-That's kind of symbolic.

297
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:10,425
How is my face?
Fresh, dewy, well cared for?

298
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:12,092
Let me get a better look.

299
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:14,675
You taste like soap.

300
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:17,675
I'm in the middle of a seven-day beauty plan.

301
00:18:19,092 --> 00:18:22,008
Can't we just get undressed
and lie together again?

302
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:26,217
That was a bad idea.

303
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:29,425
How long is this gonna go on?

304
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,675
I'm sorry you feel you've put in the time.

305
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:35,592
-We're not doing anything.
-We're doing some things.

306
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:39,092
We're not doing anything I can't do myself.

307
00:18:40,675 --> 00:18:44,050
Mark, I told you I want you.

308
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,008
In fact, I want you so much, I wanna wait.

309
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:52,217
And I told you
there's nothing to be afraid of.

310
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,008
I want to be your first.

311
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:02,925
You're so old-fashioned.

312
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,383
No, I'm not.

313
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:10,008
In Sweden, they make love
the minute they feel attracted.

314
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:14,842
And it's healthier, because you can find,
you know, the perfect person.

315
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:18,842
Because making love is
a very important part of a life with someone.

316
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:22,133
The most important in Sweden, anyway.

317
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,842
Where did you hear that?

318
00:19:25,175 --> 00:19:27,092
I read this article,
"The Swedish Way of Love."

319
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:28,550
It's very enlightened.

320
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:32,717
You're never going to get me
to do anything Swedish people do.

321
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,217
All you have to do
is take a couple of steps that way.

322
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:38,717
I brought you cookies.

323
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:45,092
I think you should go home.

324
00:19:57,092 --> 00:19:59,008
And I want you to think about that.

325
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:16,300
Sorry. Everybody leaves
the moment you have to clean up.

326
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,800
I might have a vacuum.

327
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:31,967
-Where the hell are you coming from?
-Work.

328
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,758
Where do you work?
The White Horse tavern?

329
00:20:37,258 --> 00:20:39,842
Did you have a party or something?

330
00:20:39,925 --> 00:20:44,342
-I hate parties.
-And you hate Christmas. I got it.

331
00:20:44,675 --> 00:20:46,008
I don't hate Christmas.

332
00:20:47,258 --> 00:20:48,800
I hate this Christmas.

333
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:57,967
Of course you have heat.

334
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:03,425
Can I get you something?

335
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:07,175
Come on. You're going to bed.

336
00:21:11,592 --> 00:21:13,300
Look where we are.

337
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:18,383
-You're good with that.
-My father was a drunk.

338
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,092
If you don't behave yourself,
I'm not gonna take your shoes off

339
00:21:24,175 --> 00:21:27,008
and you're gonna wake up
with sores on your heels.

340
00:21:30,008 --> 00:21:33,258
How can you stand
going to a hospital every day?

341
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:34,967
I love working at the hospital.

342
00:21:36,175 --> 00:21:39,633
People coming into the world,
people leaving it.

343
00:21:39,717 --> 00:21:41,717
Everything happens there.

344
00:21:46,258 --> 00:21:47,842
Good night, Don.

345
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:51,342
Good night!

346
00:21:57,842 --> 00:21:59,425
Against the wall, please.

347
00:22:00,758 --> 00:22:01,758
Megan.

348
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:06,217
The bar looks good.

349
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,925
I need you to get the chafing dishes
and the Sternos.

350
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:11,675
Then call Peking House
and move the delivery from 4:00 to 3:30.

351
00:22:11,758 --> 00:22:13,508
-They're always late.
-Yes, Joan.

352
00:22:16,342 --> 00:22:17,800
That one.

353
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:22,300
On the shortlist I've got Tallulah,
Jessica Tandy, Barbara Stanwyck

354
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,675
and Doris Day, different types.

355
00:22:25,342 --> 00:22:29,717
I don't even understand your list.
What's wrong with Elizabeth Taylor?

356
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:32,717
Isn't it about making old ladies look good?

357
00:22:32,883 --> 00:22:34,675
Nothing makes old ladies look good.

358
00:22:34,842 --> 00:22:37,300
But Pond's does. That's the point.

359
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:39,508
If young girls started using it,

360
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:42,800
maybe they'd End a husband
and they wouldn't be so angry.

361
00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:47,383
All I was trying to say
is that I've used the stuff

362
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:51,175
and I think there's something
about the experience of putting it on

363
00:22:51,258 --> 00:22:52,633
and looking in the mirror.

364
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:55,675
If we were to go another way,
that's not a bad idea.

365
00:22:56,258 --> 00:22:57,967
Indulging yourself, right?

366
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,508
No, if you use Pond's, you'll get married.

367
00:23:02,092 --> 00:23:03,217
That's not what I was saying.

368
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,592
Or we could go the other way.

369
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,383
If you don't use it,
then you'll never get married.

370
00:23:08,925 --> 00:23:10,342
Which is better?

371
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:11,883
You know what? Just write them down.

372
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:13,967
No, I'm not writing that down.

373
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,800
I'm sorry if I hit a nerve there, precious.

374
00:23:17,883 --> 00:23:21,717
You know, Freddy, I have brought
your name up 100 times in the last year

375
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,967
to come in and freelance, for me,
but everybody is right about you.

376
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:31,092
You and your grand dames,
and your portable typewriter

377
00:23:31,175 --> 00:23:35,217
and your desperate spinsters.
You're old-fashioned. You know that?

378
00:23:38,342 --> 00:23:39,758
-Miss Olson?
-Yes?

379
00:23:39,842 --> 00:23:41,842
Everyone is leaving
to get dressed for the party.

380
00:23:41,925 --> 00:23:44,675
-Do you need me right now?
-No, you can go.

381
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,467
I'm sorry, Freddy.

382
00:23:53,842 --> 00:23:55,092
Don't worry about it.

383
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,967
Is Violet coming?

384
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:00,508
She wouldn't miss it.

385
00:24:44,342 --> 00:24:45,383
Thank you, dear.

386
00:24:45,842 --> 00:24:49,133
You know Peter. He'd rather spend
every waking second right here in the city.

387
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:52,175
Who'd want to miss Christmas in New York?
Fifth Avenue...

388
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:55,925
Chestnuts roasting on a greasy man's
open street cart. My goodness.

389
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:58,467
We're going to the Bahamas
and there's nothing else to it.

390
00:24:59,508 --> 00:25:03,092
Harry spent so much time in Los Angeles,
I figured I'd treat him to the mountains.

391
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:04,342
Stowe.

392
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,008
What about you, Don?
Do you have any plans?

393
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:09,258
Yes, heading to Acapulco.

394
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,967
Are you taking anyone special?

395
00:25:11,717 --> 00:25:13,050
No.

396
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:14,592
Well, it's your own fault.

397
00:25:14,675 --> 00:25:18,133
Yes, I pity him,
marooned in that sea of bikinis.

398
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:20,925
Merry Christmas.

399
00:25:22,008 --> 00:25:24,175
-Nice to see you again.
-You as well, sir.

400
00:25:24,258 --> 00:25:25,342
-Don.
-Don.

401
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:31,592
We're going to get something to drink.

402
00:25:34,342 --> 00:25:36,175
Where the hell is he?

403
00:25:38,342 --> 00:25:39,758
They are children,

404
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:43,717
and they can't accept the fact
that others have to make decisions for them.

405
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,925
So, we are not part
of this herd you're talking about.

406
00:25:47,675 --> 00:25:51,508
You're from Great Britain. I'd think you'd
be familiar with the perils of socialism.

407
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:57,092
Civil rights is the beginning
of a slippery slope.

408
00:25:57,425 --> 00:26:02,217
If they pass Medicare, they won't stop
until they ban personal property.

409
00:26:02,842 --> 00:26:05,258
Storm our houses and rape our wives.

410
00:26:09,425 --> 00:26:10,758
Man your battle stations!

411
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:14,508
Nice dress. Where's Mr. Holloway?

412
00:26:14,592 --> 00:26:15,842
Saving lives.

413
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:18,758
Everyone, ladies, come on, let's go.

414
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,633
Don't forget it's a party.

415
00:26:40,342 --> 00:26:41,925
Please, please.

416
00:26:42,008 --> 00:26:44,550
I walked in here five minutes ago,
no one did anything.

417
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:47,258
Merry Christmas, Lee. That's quite a tan.

418
00:26:47,342 --> 00:26:48,425
I work at it.

419
00:26:48,508 --> 00:26:50,258
When can we expect something
for Lucky Strike

420
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,883
as good as "Let me out of here!"

421
00:26:52,342 --> 00:26:54,967
Well, Glo-Coat told me
to swing for the fences.

422
00:26:55,508 --> 00:26:57,592
Well, I didn't know I had to ask, Donny.

423
00:26:57,675 --> 00:27:01,175
We have gifts, girls and games,
but first I'm gonna get you some food.

424
00:27:01,258 --> 00:27:02,675
Well, that's a good idea, Red.

425
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:04,342
I've been drinking all day.

426
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:19,550
Don't turn on the lights, shithead.

427
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,133
Come on.

428
00:28:00,383 --> 00:28:03,133
If you hear anything, run.
Don't worry about me.

429
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:38,883
Megan, can you get Mr. Garner a drink?

430
00:28:40,342 --> 00:28:41,967
Where's Santa?

431
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,092
He didn't show,
but he did leave some presents.

432
00:28:46,342 --> 00:28:49,300
Well, I could've sworn I conga'd by a suit.

433
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:52,092
-You want to be Santa?
-Hell, no.

434
00:28:53,758 --> 00:28:55,008
How about you, Roger?

435
00:28:55,508 --> 00:28:57,133
I would, but I'm allergic to velvet.

436
00:28:57,842 --> 00:28:59,550
Come on. You'll do great.

437
00:28:59,842 --> 00:29:01,550
-Are you serious?
-Damn straight.

438
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,008
I don't think so.

439
00:29:05,842 --> 00:29:07,092
I'll do it.

440
00:29:07,175 --> 00:29:08,508
-I'd love to be Santa.
-Yes.

441
00:29:08,592 --> 00:29:10,925
Come on.
It'd take three of you to fill that suit.

442
00:29:11,592 --> 00:29:14,758
Besides, everybody knows
Santa's got white hair.

443
00:29:14,842 --> 00:29:16,508
Put it on, Roger.

444
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:18,800
Come on, Lee.

445
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,633
Put it on.

446
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:37,008
He's a hell of a sport.

447
00:29:47,633 --> 00:29:49,675
Everybody just stay there.

448
00:29:52,842 --> 00:29:54,550
Call the police.

449
00:29:54,633 --> 00:29:57,550
-ls somebody in the house?
-Maybe it's a bear.

450
00:29:59,592 --> 00:30:00,758
Hello?

451
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,133
I'm guessing it's kids.

452
00:30:06,092 --> 00:30:08,258
Let me look around the house.

453
00:30:08,342 --> 00:30:10,217
-Hello?
-Just stay here.

454
00:30:13,342 --> 00:30:14,717
Where's your lovely wife, Lane?

455
00:30:15,383 --> 00:30:19,175
She and my son are in London.
I shall be joining them soon enough.

456
00:30:19,258 --> 00:30:22,508
Mine's in Florida.
I guess we'll suffer through, eh, Jeeves?

457
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:28,300
Merry Christmas!

458
00:30:31,258 --> 00:30:34,050
It's hard to tell if he's Father Christmas
or Father Time.

459
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:36,383
Merry Christmas!

460
00:30:36,925 --> 00:30:39,883
That's a big bag, Roger.
Don't want you to have a third heart attack.

461
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,217
Right, honey?

462
00:30:45,217 --> 00:30:46,592
What have we here?

463
00:30:46,675 --> 00:30:49,883
What do all the good boys and girls
want for Christmas?

464
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,633
Lucky Strike!

465
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,258
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

466
00:30:54,342 --> 00:30:56,592
Don't smoke those all at once.

467
00:30:57,217 --> 00:31:03,008
And I have a very special present for
a little boy who knows he's been naughty.

468
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:04,883
Lee.

469
00:31:07,925 --> 00:31:09,342
You didn't need to do that.

470
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,925
Yes, we did.

471
00:31:18,842 --> 00:31:21,133
-Look at that.
-it's a Polaroid.

472
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:24,008
Thank you.

473
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:28,342
It reminds me of when I was a kid.
Remember that?

474
00:31:29,383 --> 00:31:33,050
You'd ask for something, you'd get it
and it made you happy.

475
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,133
Merry Christmas!

476
00:31:40,092 --> 00:31:41,092
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

477
00:31:41,258 --> 00:31:42,258
Merry Christmas, Don.

478
00:31:48,383 --> 00:31:50,300
There's eggs in my bed!

479
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:54,883
You can sleep in our room if you want.

480
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:57,550
My room's fine.

481
00:32:14,508 --> 00:32:15,967
Anybody home?

482
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:17,842
Not for much longer.

483
00:32:18,508 --> 00:32:22,925
I can't leave until Geoff and Bert Cooper
figure out how to take food from children.

484
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,342
Well, if anyone can do it...

485
00:32:26,592 --> 00:32:28,800
How many Christmas parties
do you have to go to?

486
00:32:31,925 --> 00:32:34,175
I pity you. Please, sit down.

487
00:32:36,008 --> 00:32:39,342
No, I just want to make sure
there were no problems.

488
00:32:41,383 --> 00:32:42,717
You really are a full-service company.

489
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,050
It's just you didn't take the test and I know
you're the creative shaman around here,

490
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,092
but you walked out of my presentation.

491
00:32:50,383 --> 00:32:55,175
I'm disappointed. I thought you came in
to flirt, but you came in to tight.

492
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:00,842
You have to know
I found out all I could about you.

493
00:33:01,342 --> 00:33:05,217
Your work is very interesting and I guess
I was hoping you thought mine was.

494
00:33:05,342 --> 00:33:09,092
It's not personal. I just don't think
you can learn much about people that way.

495
00:33:09,342 --> 00:33:11,258
I learned a lot about you.

496
00:33:11,342 --> 00:33:13,925
You're the kind of man
who doesn't want to take the test.

497
00:33:15,425 --> 00:33:18,925
I'm sorry. I just don't see
how knowing about my childhood

498
00:33:19,008 --> 00:33:20,592
is gonna help sell floor wax.

499
00:33:21,008 --> 00:33:24,675
I saw that ad.
It's all about somebody's childhood.

500
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:28,758
Look, we're both in the same business

501
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:32,092
and I'm not embarrassed to say
it's about helping people

502
00:33:32,175 --> 00:33:34,633
somehow to sort out their deepest conflict.

503
00:33:35,217 --> 00:33:36,300
And what is that?

504
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:42,675
In a nutshell, it all comes down to
"What I want versus what's expected of me."

505
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,008
That's true.

506
00:33:48,633 --> 00:33:49,758
I know it's true,

507
00:33:49,842 --> 00:33:53,217
and you would've known it's true
if you'd stayed for my presentation.

508
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,592
Want to get some dinner or something?

509
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:03,717
No, thank you. But apology accepted.

510
00:34:06,342 --> 00:34:11,383
Look, I know the holidays are hard
in your situation, but don't worry.

511
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,008
You'll be married again in a year.

512
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:14,508
What?

513
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:20,133
I'm sorry. I always forget.
Nobody wants to think they're a type.

514
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:22,883
Merry Christmas.

515
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:25,175
Merry Christmas.

516
00:34:29,758 --> 00:34:31,883
Harry. Your turn.

517
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,675
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

518
00:35:03,175 --> 00:35:04,258
Shit.

519
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:27,092
I don't see anything. Here they are.

520
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:28,675
I got them.

521
00:35:28,758 --> 00:35:29,800
Great.

522
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,050
He forgot his keys.

523
00:35:38,258 --> 00:35:40,342
I'll give you a half an hour
and then we'll meet you at Chumley's.

524
00:35:40,425 --> 00:35:42,883
Better make it an hour.
Might have to get some food in him.

525
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,008
He's pathetic.

526
00:35:53,758 --> 00:35:54,925
Hello?

527
00:35:58,342 --> 00:36:00,592
-I'm really sorry.
-it's okay.

528
00:36:03,008 --> 00:36:04,842
Switched my plans a little bit.

529
00:36:11,592 --> 00:36:14,175
I'm getting you Aspirin. Don't say no.

530
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:17,758
Top-right cabinet.

531
00:36:22,675 --> 00:36:25,175
-How about some food?
-No.

532
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,842
-Thank you.
-Okay. Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

533
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:06,758
Don't.

534
00:37:08,633 --> 00:37:10,008
Don't what?

535
00:37:19,008 --> 00:37:20,008
Oh, God.

536
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:32,008
-You smell so good.
-I feel dizzy.

537
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:22,717
My goodness.

538
00:38:24,925 --> 00:38:26,175
I know.

539
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,425
I'm supposed to meet somebody.

540
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:49,342
I should really go.

541
00:38:52,467 --> 00:38:54,675
-You sure?
-Yes.

542
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:25,050
I understand. it's okay.

543
00:39:26,675 --> 00:39:27,800
Okay.

544
00:39:29,717 --> 00:39:33,008
I'll see you tomorrow, I guess.

545
00:40:08,508 --> 00:40:09,508
Freddy.

546
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:13,717
I'm sorry I'm at your desk.
It was the cleanest spot in the office.

547
00:40:15,842 --> 00:40:19,175
Are you okay? You didn't come to the party.

548
00:40:23,175 --> 00:40:26,550
It's been my experience
that when they give you that Santa suit,

549
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,675
there's usually a bottle
already in the pocket.

550
00:40:32,092 --> 00:40:33,425
Thank God.

551
00:40:33,508 --> 00:40:35,592
I don't want to worry
that every time I hurt your feelings

552
00:40:35,675 --> 00:40:38,175
you're gonna start drinking again.

553
00:40:38,258 --> 00:40:40,550
Then why don't you stop
hurting my feelings?

554
00:40:46,425 --> 00:40:47,758
I'm sorry.

555
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,133
I'm sorry I said you were old-fashioned.

556
00:40:53,842 --> 00:40:57,050
And I'm sorry
I said you wanted to get married.

557
00:40:59,175 --> 00:41:00,842
I do want to get married.

558
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:04,050
You've got to work less and find somebody.

559
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:06,550
I have a boyfriend.

560
00:41:07,175 --> 00:41:08,383
Is it serious?

561
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,967
I don't know yet.

562
00:41:12,175 --> 00:41:13,300
But he won't leave me alone.

563
00:41:15,717 --> 00:41:16,883
I was that way with Violet.

564
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:18,925
Insatiable.

565
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:24,300
Freddy, I don't want to talk about this.

566
00:41:24,383 --> 00:41:26,383
Hey, you brought it up.

567
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,717
I haven't done much work on this,
I have to be honest,

568
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,342
and I need to get some coffee.

569
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:34,508
You'll be fine.

570
00:41:41,592 --> 00:41:44,175
I don't want to be alone on New Year's Eve.

571
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,467
My two cents?

572
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:51,883
If you're gonna marry him,
you can't do anything

573
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,675
or he won't respect you.

574
00:41:55,592 --> 00:41:56,883
What if I don't know?

575
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,800
Well, you can't lead him on. That is
physically very uncomfortable, you know.

576
00:42:02,342 --> 00:42:03,550
It's not a joke.

577
00:42:21,842 --> 00:42:25,092
Did you enjoy the fuhrer's birthday?

578
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:27,342
May he live for 1,000 years.

579
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:33,300
My father used to say this is the greatest job
in the world except for one thing,

580
00:42:33,383 --> 00:42:34,800
the clients.

581
00:42:44,133 --> 00:42:45,633
Good morning.

582
00:42:47,092 --> 00:42:49,425
-Did you make it home last night?
-I did.

583
00:42:49,717 --> 00:42:50,883
I did.

584
00:42:53,008 --> 00:42:54,175
Come inside.

585
00:42:58,133 --> 00:43:00,800
-What's all this?
-For your children.

586
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:04,175
I bought them the other day,
but I finally got them wrapped.

587
00:43:05,342 --> 00:43:06,342
Thank you.

588
00:43:06,883 --> 00:43:08,883
Do you want me to get the door?

589
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:10,008
No.

590
00:43:11,175 --> 00:43:12,592
Do you need some coffee?

591
00:43:13,092 --> 00:43:15,925
I had some. It was quite a party.

592
00:43:18,008 --> 00:43:19,008
I really overdid it.

593
00:43:19,675 --> 00:43:20,675
Me, too.

594
00:43:29,717 --> 00:43:32,592
Thank you for bringing my keys.
I really appreciate it.

595
00:43:33,842 --> 00:43:38,050
I've probably taken advantage
of your kindness on too many occasions.

596
00:43:39,842 --> 00:43:41,592
Excuse me?

597
00:43:44,175 --> 00:43:47,300
I just wanted to say thank you
for bringing my keys.

598
00:43:50,175 --> 00:43:51,300
Okay.

599
00:43:54,175 --> 00:43:57,800
I know we talked about
how tough things are for the firm,

600
00:43:59,842 --> 00:44:02,508
but I wanted you to know...

601
00:44:06,258 --> 00:44:09,508
Well, here's the bonus we talked about.

602
00:44:13,175 --> 00:44:14,800
Merry Christmas.

603
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:18,883
Thank you.

604
00:44:22,383 --> 00:44:24,508
Anything else for right now?

605
00:44:25,592 --> 00:44:26,633
No.

606
00:45:34,508 --> 00:45:35,550
Hey.

607
00:45:38,342 --> 00:45:41,258
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, of course.

608
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:45,008
Do you feel different?
