1
00:00:40,883 --> 00:00:44,258
Lee, Lee,
Don doesn't think there's a problem.

2
00:00:44,717 --> 00:00:47,633
Lee, those restrictions
aren't going to affect Lucky Strike.

3
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,175
Besides, Lee,
your lawyers came up with them.

4
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,967
"No more smoking teenagers,"
we complied a year ago.

5
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,175
"No more famous athletes"

6
00:00:56,258 --> 00:00:59,008
and we have to stop using certain angles.

7
00:01:01,217 --> 00:01:02,758
Low angles, wide lenses,

8
00:01:02,842 --> 00:01:05,175
anything that makes the smoker
appear superhuman.

9
00:01:08,717 --> 00:01:09,717
Why is this empty?

10
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:11,175
Because you drank it all.

11
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:13,425
-He can't hear you.
-There's kind of a loophole

12
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:16,342
because even without athletes
you can still use sports.

13
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:19,675
Bowling, for example, seems a natural Ht.

14
00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:22,633
Bowling is a sport, Lee.

15
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,425
How about horse-racing?

16
00:01:26,842 --> 00:01:29,342
Lee, Lee, the jockey smokes the cigarette.

17
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:31,467
Did either of you ladies
bring any ice with you?

18
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:35,008
We're sorting out the focus group for Pond's
and I haven't gotten the hypothesis,

19
00:01:35,092 --> 00:01:36,092
in writing anyway.

20
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:37,175
He said, "Don."

21
00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:42,342
We'll do our best. Peggy, write it up.

22
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:43,633
You haven't okayed the brief.

23
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:45,842
I liked your idea. I liked it a lot.

24
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:47,467
The mirror one or the cleansing one?

25
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:48,925
What's the mirror one?

26
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,758
Well, I think it's about the ritual,
the multiple applications, indulgence.

27
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,092
Pond's is the only cold cream that allows me

28
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:59,633
to stare at myself in the mirror
for 20 minutes

29
00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:01,217
and feel good and not vain.

30
00:02:02,925 --> 00:02:04,550
That's very good.

31
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:09,717
So, we're talking about girls, 18 to 25.

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,008
Can I grab a few from around here?

33
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:12,383
Yeah, help yourself.

34
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:14,217
See, I would never buy a sailboat.

35
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,425
I don't want to do things myself.

36
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,342
For that price,
that boat should have a motor.

37
00:02:19,842 --> 00:02:21,050
A what?

38
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:25,092
-One of those, too.
-Anything else?

39
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:31,342
I don't know.
Why don't you ask Don about that?

40
00:02:31,883 --> 00:02:33,550
I have to go to the little boys' room.

41
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,508
I'm sorry, Lee,
can you go through that one more time?

42
00:02:40,383 --> 00:02:43,258
That's the Lucky Strike call?
Why wasn't I told?

43
00:02:43,342 --> 00:02:45,258
Be happy. I saved you an ass-ache.

44
00:02:51,342 --> 00:02:52,883
So what's so bad he couldn't tell me?

45
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:57,467
Cal Rutledge from Chesebrough-Pond's
has a wild hair about Clearasil.

46
00:02:57,883 --> 00:02:59,175
He thinks they're in conflict.

47
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:01,258
Pimple cream and cold cream?

48
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:02,550
A rather broad definition.

49
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:04,508
Does it matter?

50
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:07,675
Look, Pete, we're going to have
to resign the Clearasil account.

51
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,508
-Why?
-Lane.

52
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,425
It can't be up for debate.

53
00:03:13,508 --> 00:03:17,258
Clearasil is worth $1.25 million in billings,
and Pond's over two.

54
00:03:18,092 --> 00:03:19,175
No.

55
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:21,008
You know what it took
to get my father-in-law

56
00:03:21,092 --> 00:03:22,508
to join this new firm to begin with?

57
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,217
Fifteen percent of $750,000 is near $113,000.

58
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:31,467
Roger, I don't expect him
to understand this,

59
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,550
but do you have any idea
of what I've had to do to keep that account?

60
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:36,258
The personal toll I've paid?

61
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:40,425
I do, but you've been good to him,
remember that, sales-wise.

62
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:43,258
-Mr. Sterling?
-I don't believe this.

63
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:46,717
-Roger.
-Throw yourself on a grenade.

64
00:03:47,342 --> 00:03:50,133
Protect the agency. You're a partner now.

65
00:03:51,342 --> 00:03:52,508
This evening if you can.

66
00:03:56,508 --> 00:03:58,717
Over half this agency
is dedicated to your needs,

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
but if you want to get into the line-by-line

68
00:04:00,883 --> 00:04:02,592
of the costs we've billed for,

69
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:06,133
I'll have Lane Pryce
at the foot of your bed in 20 minutes.

70
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,258
Oh, my God, there's some kind of fire.

71
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:11,008
Right down by Radio City.

72
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:13,508
Roger, we should go. Sorry, Lee.

73
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:17,842
We gotta go. Okay, bye-bye.

74
00:04:24,342 --> 00:04:25,425
Should I type all this up?

75
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:29,342
Yes. And remind me
to remind Caroline to tell Lane

76
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:31,758
that Lucky Strike noticed
that they're being billed

77
00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:34,217
for all the work we do
for everybody else at this agency.

78
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:37,800
You know what? I don't want that on paper.

79
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,050
-Who is that?
-A dear friend.

80
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:47,592
Is that the letter from California?

81
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:49,008
Yes.

82
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,133
-I hate this office.
-You wanted to be close to Roger.

83
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,925
Make yourself at home, why don't you?

84
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,717
Did you see Sunday's paper?

85
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:11,258
If this is about the Playtex ad
they keep complaining about,

86
00:05:11,383 --> 00:05:13,258
I've been told
the printer swapped paper stocks.

87
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:15,300
And I don't care
if she looks like a Puerto Rican.

88
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:16,717
Puerto Rican girls buy brassieres.

89
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:18,800
Not that they need to.

90
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:23,550
I saw this one on the subway
in one of those striped Jean Seberg shirts,

91
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:25,675
red rag in her hair, nipples...

92
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,258
I'm not in the mood. What do you want?

93
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:31,175
-Cosgrove's getting married.
-So?

94
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,133
He took us to the opera last month,
great seats, and now I know why.

95
00:05:35,342 --> 00:05:36,883
It turns out her father shits gold ingots.

96
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:38,383
What does he do?

97
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:41,092
CFO of Corning.

98
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,300
My father-in-law's a bus driver.

99
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,050
The only place he can take me
is to the moon.

100
00:05:44,592 --> 00:05:46,967
Ken's the competition.
Why are you going to the opera with him?

101
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:50,300
Geyer is twice our size,
and we're friends, aren't we?

102
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:51,842
Friends.

103
00:05:52,592 --> 00:05:54,675
Why are you always looking for a job?

104
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:56,758
What?

105
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:00,425
Look, Pete.

106
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:03,925
There's a group of us,
we're all coming up together.

107
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:05,633
You don't think Kenny's a comer?

108
00:06:05,717 --> 00:06:07,925
You know he has Mountain Dew?
That's Pepsi.

109
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:12,550
We're having lunch tomorrow. Tag along.
He always asks about you.

110
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:14,175
Of course he does.

111
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:17,758
Worst case, Kenny'll brag too much
and you can steal a client from him.

112
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,175
Hello.

113
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,842
I'm sorry. That looks like bad news.

114
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:45,508
It's not mine. I'm Joyce.
I work at Life, assistant photo editor.

115
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,925
Peggy Olson, Sterling Cooper
Draper Pryce, copywriter.

116
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:51,967
Really?

117
00:06:52,717 --> 00:06:54,675
Life magazine, I love the photos.

118
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:57,175
Well, you'll never see these.

119
00:07:01,592 --> 00:07:03,342
I have to admit I'd be shocked.

120
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:06,883
He's my friend, and my boss hates nudes.

121
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:08,258
Who hates nudes?

122
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,342
That's a beautiful one.

123
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:20,592
I'm going to the mailroom.
Peggy, right? 37th floor?

124
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:41,175
Tom, you're 15 minutes early.

125
00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:43,092
So are you. Sit down.

126
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:45,342
We can eat anytime or not at all.

127
00:07:45,425 --> 00:07:47,717
Excuse me. Dewar's on the rocks.

128
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:51,425
What's so important?

129
00:07:53,592 --> 00:07:55,967
Tom, how are you feeling?

130
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:58,508
Couldn't be better.

131
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:03,967
I hope you know I've always done my best
to make you happy.

132
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,175
I do.

133
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,800
And there's no reason,
as far as I'm concerned,

134
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:12,675
that there should be any change in the way
that we deal with each other.

135
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:14,842
Tom, I...

136
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:18,675
This is very hard for me to say.

137
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:21,425
I honestly don't know how
you're going to take this

138
00:08:21,508 --> 00:08:23,217
and it's been very hard to separate

139
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,883
our business relationship
from the rest of our life,

140
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:27,633
but they should be separate.

141
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,467
You are some kind of high WASP, all right.

142
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,508
-Look, I can't keep this up.
-Keep what up?

143
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:36,717
I heard.

144
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,967
You know?

145
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:42,008
You crazy kid.

146
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,175
What are you talking about?

147
00:08:48,717 --> 00:08:52,633
Jeannie was with Trudy at the doctor.
Congratulations!

148
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,175
What?

149
00:08:57,258 --> 00:08:59,675
Oh, shit.

150
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:03,050
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

151
00:09:03,758 --> 00:09:07,758
It was Monday, for crying out loud.
Why hasn't she told you?

152
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:09,967
I don't know.

153
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,133
Well, it may be her news,
but it is good news.

154
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:15,592
You can't tell her that I told you. You can't.

155
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:21,633
I'm going to be a father?

156
00:09:21,758 --> 00:09:22,842
Can you believe it?

157
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,633
-I'm going to be a father.
-Yeah.

158
00:09:31,717 --> 00:09:34,508
I feel like my heart's going to burst.

159
00:09:34,592 --> 00:09:38,300
Champagne right here. Bring a bottle.
We're going to tie one on.

160
00:09:38,383 --> 00:09:42,175
If it's a boy, it's $1 ,000, a girl, $500.

161
00:09:42,258 --> 00:09:44,133
I'll do what I can do.

162
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:47,050
You really can't tell Trudy.

163
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:50,175
I don't know howl let the cat out of the bag.

164
00:09:50,342 --> 00:09:52,133
I thought you knew
what I was talking about.

165
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,800
-What did you think I was talking about?
-What?

166
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:56,800
Why did you have to see me?

167
00:09:58,842 --> 00:10:00,508
I just wanted to...

168
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:04,592
We're putting new creative on Clearasil.

169
00:10:04,717 --> 00:10:05,717
Fine. Who cares?

170
00:10:07,383 --> 00:10:10,508
May you know this feeling many times.

171
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:15,425
I only had the one,

172
00:10:15,508 --> 00:10:18,675
and I love her to death,
but I wish we'd had more.

173
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:24,383
Jeannie had her uterus removed,
some kind of a cyst or something.

174
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:29,258
Trudy!

175
00:10:36,383 --> 00:10:38,967
I'm sick, Peter. I'm so sick about this.

176
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,592
Daddy just called me from a pay phone,
drunk and in tears.

177
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:46,050
I know what you think. I just wanted to wait
till our anniversary to tell you.

178
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:49,217
I don't care, Trudy.

179
00:10:50,092 --> 00:10:51,175
I don't care how I heard.

180
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:55,258
Peter.

181
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:03,467
How did this happen?
What did the doctor say?

182
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,508
He said I was going to have a baby.

183
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:10,258
I want to pick you up and spin you around,

184
00:11:10,342 --> 00:11:13,258
but I don't want
to damage anything in there.

185
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:16,008
I'm so happy you're happy.

186
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,383
I don't know.
It feels much different than I expected.

187
00:11:19,675 --> 00:11:22,300
How would you know what this feels like?

188
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,175
Come, get off your feet.

189
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,717
How are you feeling?

190
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:32,342
Tell me you'll forgive my father.

191
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,342
They already think you hate them
and honestly, it's my fault.

192
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,592
I don't hate them.

193
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:40,842
I shouldn't have taken my mother
to the doctor, not that doctor.

194
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:43,092
It's just...
I thought something was going on,

195
00:11:43,175 --> 00:11:44,842
and I was so prepared to be disappointed

196
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:47,217
or that, God forbid,
something was really wrong.

197
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:52,175
Trudy, I had to talk to him
because the agency has to drop Clearasil.

198
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:56,050
-Why?
-There's another product that's similar,

199
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,258
-and we can't...
-A conflict.

200
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,342
Peter, I'm familiar with the term.
You use it all the time.

201
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,592
I invited him there
and his good news trumped my bad news.

202
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:08,133
And the funny thing is,
that was the moment to tell him.

203
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:10,133
I was so bowled over.

204
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,633
We did it.

205
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:22,425
Why don't you
let my father hear this from me?

206
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,633
He's already so guilty,
he'll never feel the knife go in.

207
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:27,300
I can't let you do that.

208
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:31,092
But I'm the one who talked him
into returning to the agency to begin with.

209
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:33,800
-We needed him.
-And now you don't.

210
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:36,467
He'll be fine. Tomorrow night.

211
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,092
Yankee pot roast.

212
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,425
Let's go.
Caroline will be watching your desk.

213
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:51,383
Why don't you have to do this?

214
00:12:51,758 --> 00:12:54,050
You don't have to do this.
You're getting paid.

215
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:57,675
We're old and we're married.
They don't want us.

216
00:12:57,758 --> 00:13:00,217
But I use Pond's. I do.

217
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Come on.

218
00:13:06,508 --> 00:13:10,175
Girls, rind your places.
Megan, help me with the curtains.

219
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,842
No matter how late I come,
I'm always waiting for someone.

220
00:13:25,925 --> 00:13:28,592
I had to wait until the girls
left the ladies' room to change.

221
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:31,175
You could've used my office,
but I don't have one.

222
00:13:34,675 --> 00:13:37,425
-This isn't right.
-I thought you wanted Faye, not Dr. Miller.

223
00:13:38,008 --> 00:13:41,675
Yes, but I told someone
to leave the "e" off of Faye.

224
00:13:41,758 --> 00:13:44,717
I like to be able to correct it in front
of the girls. It makes them trust me.

225
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,133
Because your name is spelled wrong?

226
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:50,008
Because I'm obviously not that important.
I don't need it.

227
00:13:52,717 --> 00:13:54,425
I have to warn you there's lots of perfume.

228
00:13:55,258 --> 00:13:56,842
There always is.

229
00:14:11,592 --> 00:14:13,425
...why everyone has a nifty name tag.

230
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:17,217
Very well then.
I suppose I'll work in Mr. Sterling's office.

231
00:14:17,342 --> 00:14:18,675
He won't be coming.

232
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,383
As I said, my name is Faye.

233
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:25,258
I don't have a name tag.

234
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:26,883
I guess they forgot about me.

235
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:32,925
They got mine wrong. I'm Dotty.

236
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,550
I mean I'm not a dotty person.
That's my name.

237
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:39,717
Hello, Dotty.

238
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:44,133
So, there's no reason to be anxious.

239
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:48,342
We have to enjoy the fact that we're all
getting paid not to work for a little bit.

240
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:53,800
But don't worry, that's our little secret.

241
00:14:54,675 --> 00:14:57,633
And I'd like you to think that this is
just a bunch of your friends,

242
00:14:57,717 --> 00:15:04,508
as if maybe this is a sorority
or a bridal shower with tea.

243
00:15:05,092 --> 00:15:11,342
Or just a bunch of us celebrating, say
Allison 's birthday at my apartment.

244
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:17,758
You shouldn't be surprised,
looking around the room,

245
00:15:17,842 --> 00:15:22,342
that we're here to talk about beauty.

246
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,967
What are the things we all do
to keep ourselves beautiful

247
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,092
or simply to enhance it?

248
00:15:31,842 --> 00:15:32,842
Please pass a Danish.

249
00:15:35,758 --> 00:15:38,758
You don't have to raise your hand. Anyone?

250
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:41,967
I can say it.

251
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:44,217
I have a routine.

252
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:49,425
I brush my hair 100 times
just like I did when I was a little girl,

253
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,175
but of course only the night
before I have it set.

254
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:58,383
-Very cute.
-Can you imagine?

255
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:03,342
Your financial future's in the hands
of a roomful of 22-year-old girls.

256
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:04,800
Not mine.

257
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:11,175
Okay. Sometimes I watch my weight.

258
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,842
No one's hungry?

259
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:20,675
I'd like a Danish.

260
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,092
I don't use Pond's,
if that's what you're asking.

261
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,592
That's okay.

262
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,758
I'm of French extraction
and my mother has beautiful skin.

263
00:16:29,842 --> 00:16:32,092
She never washes her face.

264
00:16:32,175 --> 00:16:35,008
She's not dirty.
She uses water, but nothing else.

265
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:37,633
And you do what she does?

266
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:40,008
What does she do?

267
00:16:42,008 --> 00:16:43,592
She stands at the sink

268
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:47,675
and she runs the water until it's
just the perfect temperature, not too hot.

269
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:52,883
And she splashes it on her face
and she pats her cheeks with her fingertips.

270
00:16:54,508 --> 00:16:56,508
And she looks at herself?

271
00:16:58,175 --> 00:16:59,717
Yes, she does.

272
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:05,592
She's amazing.

273
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:11,675
I sit at my vanity and I have this night cream,
my boyfriend laughed at me.

274
00:17:12,508 --> 00:17:13,842
What was so funny about it?

275
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,842
It was just, you know, one time.

276
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:21,258
At Christmas Eve we were staying up late
and we were playing house, I guess.

277
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:26,258
You shouldn't do things for them.
They don't appreciate it.

278
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:29,175
You don't think
they appreciate you being beautiful?

279
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,133
We broke up a year ago.

280
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:38,383
Actually, I don't know what he noticed,
but it wasn't me, I guess.

281
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:40,883
It's worse when they notice, sometimes.

282
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:44,508
Allison, please, continue.

283
00:17:46,675 --> 00:17:48,342
It's nothing.

284
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,383
-Are you in there?
-Yes.

285
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:03,383
I asked your girl to inform me of your arrival.

286
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,967
She's in that group.

287
00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:07,008
Did you speak with Tom?

288
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:10,717
I'm sorry. It didn't happen.
The opportunity passed.

289
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:15,175
Well, then we shall endeavor to recreate it.
Perhaps lunch today?

290
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:19,383
I'm afraid Roger's already informed Pond's
that this was attended to.

291
00:18:20,592 --> 00:18:22,092
That's sloppy.

292
00:18:22,592 --> 00:18:25,175
I have a lunch, but I'm seeing him tonight.

293
00:18:25,675 --> 00:18:26,800
Damn it.

294
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:30,508
Lane.

295
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:35,342
I just found out I'm going to be a father.

296
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:38,175
Well, now, that should
take the sting out of all of this.

297
00:18:39,758 --> 00:18:41,092
I suppose.

298
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,175
I apologize.

299
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,342
That's the very best news.

300
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:53,008
Congratulations.

301
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,050
Thank you.

302
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:10,467
And I just kept thinking,
"Why does he stare at other girls?"

303
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,675
Well, men do that,
but does he look at me that way?

304
00:19:18,217 --> 00:19:21,175
And we're not married, so who am I?

305
00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:24,800
How the hell did this get so sad so fast?

306
00:19:25,883 --> 00:19:28,300
I know I'm speaking for everyone here.

307
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:32,258
But you can't think it has anything to do
with how you look, Dotty.

308
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,008
You can only do your best
with what God gave you.

309
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:39,300
What about makeup?

310
00:19:41,383 --> 00:19:44,175
I feel like it doesn't matter what I see.

311
00:19:44,842 --> 00:19:46,008
It matters what he sees.

312
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,467
I feel like I gave him everything
and I got nothing.

313
00:19:55,883 --> 00:19:57,633
I could see she was gonna crack.

314
00:19:58,467 --> 00:19:59,467
Allison?

315
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,925
Are you all right, dear?

316
00:20:06,508 --> 00:20:09,633
-It's okay. She'll be all right.
-Should I...

317
00:20:09,883 --> 00:20:11,758
If she wanted to be around us,
she would've stayed.

318
00:20:15,092 --> 00:20:18,175
Sarah, what do you do that makes you feel
good about the way you look?

319
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,342
I feel kind of responsible. Do you mind?

320
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:26,508
Is there any kind of ritual?

321
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,508
I think my strategy was right.

322
00:20:29,592 --> 00:20:32,633
They just wanna get married
and they'll buy anything that'll help.

323
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,508
-Are you all right?
-it's you.

324
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:42,967
Come with me.

325
00:20:50,675 --> 00:20:54,133
People cry in these things all the time.
Grown men.

326
00:20:54,217 --> 00:20:56,508
I was in a bunch
when I first started working here.

327
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:58,758
I'd say half the time somebody cries.

328
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,217
Really?

329
00:21:02,092 --> 00:21:03,717
I think it just feels good to talk.

330
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:07,300
I can't even say anything
because I know he's right out there,

331
00:21:07,383 --> 00:21:08,758
right through the glass.

332
00:21:10,217 --> 00:21:11,300
Who?

333
00:21:11,883 --> 00:21:13,842
I don't know how you stand it.

334
00:21:13,925 --> 00:21:18,425
The way he turns on the charm one minute
and then yanks it away.

335
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:19,883
How can you even talk to him?

336
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:21,675
Don?

337
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:23,258
Would you stop it?

338
00:21:23,342 --> 00:21:26,008
I realize you must've gone through
everything I've gone through.

339
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:29,883
But now I know. It's just, he's a drunk.

340
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:33,008
And they get away with murder
because they forget everything.

341
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:37,050
I don't know what you think.

342
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:41,425
Forget it.

343
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,008
Your problem is not my problem.

344
00:21:44,842 --> 00:21:47,383
-Fine.
-And honestly, you should get over it.

345
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:49,425
Please leave me alone.

346
00:21:56,008 --> 00:21:58,425
-Thank you. Nice to meet you, too.
-Nice to meet you.

347
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:00,175
-Bye.
-Bye.

348
00:22:00,925 --> 00:22:03,967
-Did she go home?
-No, she's fine.

349
00:22:04,842 --> 00:22:06,217
Nothing else good happened.

350
00:22:06,383 --> 00:22:08,008
-Bye, now.
-Okay, great.

351
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:09,092
Bye-bye.

352
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,342
That went very well.

353
00:22:13,342 --> 00:22:15,175
You can stop the tape.

354
00:22:18,592 --> 00:22:19,592
Is she okay?

355
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,675
-Who?
-Yeah, she's fine.

356
00:22:24,842 --> 00:22:28,008
All right. Let's talk preliminary results.

357
00:22:29,008 --> 00:22:32,383
Is it all right
if we put this back the way it goes?

358
00:22:33,383 --> 00:22:34,508
We can go to my office.

359
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,425
Let's go in there.

360
00:22:47,258 --> 00:22:48,550
That's big, big news.

361
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,592
If you need any baby crap,
Jen and I have a closetful.

362
00:22:53,008 --> 00:22:55,217
-Hello, fellows.
-Good to see you, Kenny.

363
00:22:55,425 --> 00:22:57,467
-Pete.
-How are you, Ken?

364
00:22:59,717 --> 00:23:02,175
-Mr. Crane.
-Over here, Gil.

365
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:04,008
There's a phone call for you.

366
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:08,300
I've gotta get this. Those goniffs
at CBS are screwing me again.

367
00:23:08,425 --> 00:23:11,842
-Those what?
-Order for me, Caesar salad, no dressing.

368
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:17,842
-You wanna take a look?
-Sure.

369
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:28,633
Listen, I've gotta get this out of the way.

370
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:32,633
But I would appreciate it for the future

371
00:23:32,717 --> 00:23:34,925
if you would not say shitty things
about me behind my back.

372
00:23:36,508 --> 00:23:37,467
What?

373
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,842
Come on.
Are you gonna deny it and make it worse?

374
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:42,008
I don't know what you've heard,
but it's not true.

375
00:23:42,925 --> 00:23:46,383
You didn't call me an All-American idiot
who fell into everything?

376
00:23:48,008 --> 00:23:49,633
Whom did I supposedly say this to?

377
00:23:50,175 --> 00:23:51,175
Does it matter?

378
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:53,925
Well, I'd like to defend myself.

379
00:23:54,342 --> 00:23:56,800
I heard that you told your wife
that I was driving the tractor

380
00:23:56,883 --> 00:23:57,925
when the accident happened.

381
00:23:58,383 --> 00:24:01,342
What? I don't think so.

382
00:24:01,425 --> 00:24:04,592
What I probably said was
that you were involved,

383
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:07,133
we all were, and that it was your account.

384
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,717
And Crane told me yesterday
you said I was marrying for money.

385
00:24:10,508 --> 00:24:12,675
I didn't say that. He did.

386
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:15,217
Well, he's like that,
and everybody who knows him knows that.

387
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,925
But when you say it, and especially
when it gets back to my fiancee,

388
00:24:19,008 --> 00:24:21,508
Trudy knows her, you know,
some garden club.

389
00:24:23,425 --> 00:24:25,300
I was unaware of that.

390
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,300
Look, you know what?

391
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,008
I apologize. Mea culpa.

392
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:36,217
Textbook Harry.

393
00:24:37,508 --> 00:24:38,967
You know what? He's buying lunch.

394
00:24:39,842 --> 00:24:42,675
I don't really care.
I'm just glad to be out of the office.

395
00:24:43,342 --> 00:24:45,883
It is nice, especially without having to listen

396
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:49,092
to some client yammering
about how dirty the city is.

397
00:24:50,258 --> 00:24:51,425
How's it going?

398
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:55,592
I've been floating along laterally,
but I don't know that it's a love affair.

399
00:24:55,675 --> 00:24:57,883
-It's better than McCann.
-What was that like?

400
00:24:58,258 --> 00:25:01,967
Are you kidding me? it's the worst agency
I've ever seen. The worst.

401
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,967
My mother was a nurse
at the state hospital in Vermont

402
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,550
and that was the last time I saw
so many retarded people in one building.

403
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:16,300
So, you're getting married. Congratulations.

404
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:18,467
It's all that really matters, right?

405
00:25:20,508 --> 00:25:23,425
Actually, I have a bit of news of my own.

406
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:26,508
Trudy is with child.

407
00:25:27,508 --> 00:25:29,675
Good for you. Good for you.

408
00:25:30,883 --> 00:25:32,092
I'll be honest, I can't wait.

409
00:25:32,675 --> 00:25:35,050
It's very good so far.

410
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:39,467
A new family, a new agency,
has to be exciting.

411
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:43,508
Well, you know, wherever you do this job,
you're doing this job.

412
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,133
I know you're all slaves to Draper over there,

413
00:25:46,217 --> 00:25:50,217
but I'd rather be a slave to creative
than some old fart.

414
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,592
Whoever pours the last drink
gets all the credit

415
00:25:52,675 --> 00:25:55,008
and you're spinning your wheels
half the time.

416
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,758
Right now we're chasing Mountain Dew.

417
00:25:58,842 --> 00:26:01,133
Supposedly we're going
to turn it into Pepsi,

418
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:04,467
but the only reason Pepsi would do it
is to make BBDO sweat.

419
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:08,592
This whole idea that
we'd get the bigger company is a joke.

420
00:26:08,675 --> 00:26:10,717
We'd just end up
with a bunch of little pieces.

421
00:26:14,425 --> 00:26:17,217
Well, the grass is always greener.

422
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,967
Who am I kidding? Look how lucky we are.

423
00:26:22,342 --> 00:26:26,092
Another Campbell,
that's just what the world needs.

424
00:26:40,258 --> 00:26:42,842
-Can I come in?
-It's your office.

425
00:26:43,508 --> 00:26:44,883
Glad to see you're feeling better.

426
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,633
If you don't feel like working...

427
00:27:01,592 --> 00:27:02,883
What?

428
00:27:04,092 --> 00:27:05,925
I'm very embarrassed.

429
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:08,675
People cry in those groups
all the time, Allison.

430
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,175
That's not what I'm embarrassed about.

431
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,925
This actually happened.

432
00:27:19,717 --> 00:27:20,925
I know.

433
00:27:22,342 --> 00:27:23,717
I know.

434
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:25,842
We made a mistake

435
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:33,883
and I feel like it's awkward
and it's better for both of us if I move on.

436
00:27:35,008 --> 00:27:37,383
I don't think that's necessary.
We're both adults.

437
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,508
No, I really would feel better about it.

438
00:27:40,967 --> 00:27:43,842
A friend of mine told me
about a job at a magazine

439
00:27:43,925 --> 00:27:48,342
and I thought that might be interesting,
working for a woman.

440
00:27:50,675 --> 00:27:52,050
Anyway, I...

441
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:56,425
I would appreciate it
if you could write me a recommendation.

442
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,092
Absolutely.
What would probably be even better

443
00:27:59,175 --> 00:28:02,008
is if you type up whatever you want
and I'll sign it.

444
00:28:03,508 --> 00:28:04,508
What?

445
00:28:04,758 --> 00:28:06,217
You've been sparkling in your duties.

446
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,008
Just put it on my stationery,
put whatever you want and I'll sign it.

447
00:28:23,717 --> 00:28:27,800
I don't say this easily,
but you're not a good person.

448
00:28:32,175 --> 00:28:33,175
Allison, hold on.

449
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,592
What's going on?

450
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:57,300
I'm gonna need a new secretary.
And this cleaned up.

451
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,717
Would you be open
to Allison returning in a couple of days?

452
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,300
-If that's what she wants.
-Really?

453
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,300
No.

454
00:29:32,967 --> 00:29:36,008
There's a Joyce Ramsay
to see you at reception.

455
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,050
So, at this point
you've read everything out here?

456
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:43,425
I don't even like magazines,

457
00:29:43,508 --> 00:29:46,300
but I brought in a book
and they told me it didn't look right.

458
00:29:46,842 --> 00:29:47,842
Hi.

459
00:29:49,592 --> 00:29:50,925
Do you want
to come back and see my office?

460
00:29:51,675 --> 00:29:52,800
Another time.

461
00:29:52,883 --> 00:29:57,133
Listen, my friend the photographer,
Mr. Reject, he's having a...

462
00:29:57,967 --> 00:30:00,258
I don't even know what to call it, downtown.

463
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:02,842
Are you inviting me?

464
00:30:05,883 --> 00:30:09,050
-Are you afraid of the subway?
-Of course not.

465
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,508
Thanks, sweetheart.

466
00:30:11,842 --> 00:30:12,842
Washington Market,

467
00:30:13,675 --> 00:30:17,550
unless you have to work
or have plans that are more interesting.

468
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:20,467
It starts at 9:00. I'll be there at 10:00.

469
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,842
She's kind of pretentious.

470
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:29,133
I know.

471
00:30:35,883 --> 00:30:39,092
Darling, we're so excited.

472
00:30:39,175 --> 00:30:41,175
Is that you, Peter?

473
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:43,425
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut from now on.

474
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:48,800
Well, hello there.

475
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:51,717
-How are you feeling?
-A little behind.

476
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,550
Why don't you let me
fix my father and you a drink

477
00:30:53,633 --> 00:30:56,258
and you can show my mother
what we have planned for the maid's room.

478
00:30:56,508 --> 00:30:57,800
I'll make the drinks. I don't care.

479
00:30:58,133 --> 00:30:59,967
No, why don't you show
your mother the maid's room?

480
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,717
I don't know that I'm an expert.

481
00:31:01,842 --> 00:31:03,133
Okay.

482
00:31:04,175 --> 00:31:05,342
Come along, Mother.

483
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:09,467
We're a couple of lucky ducks, aren't we?

484
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,258
We are. Tom, let me ask you something.

485
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:14,758
-What are you having?
-In a minute. Listen...

486
00:31:14,842 --> 00:31:17,008
I know what you're gonna say.

487
00:31:18,217 --> 00:31:20,175
You need a bigger apartment. I get it.

488
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,592
Every time you jump to conclusions,
Tom, you make me respect you less.

489
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:25,675
-What?
-LOOK.

490
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,425
You gave us Clearasil
and we're extremely grateful,

491
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:30,342
but there's only so much business
it's going to do.

492
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:32,800
Yeah, well, that's kind of in your hands,
isn't it?

493
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:34,508
I'm done auditioning.

494
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:38,592
You gave us this under a certain pretext.

495
00:31:38,675 --> 00:31:39,675
I've done well by you.

496
00:31:39,758 --> 00:31:42,842
And the idea was
if we do well by this account,

497
00:31:42,925 --> 00:31:44,633
you'll give us a shot at the big one,

498
00:31:44,717 --> 00:31:47,467
because right now
I have bigger business than Clearasil.

499
00:31:48,258 --> 00:31:49,258
Are you mad at me?

500
00:31:49,883 --> 00:31:51,217
No.

501
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,550
Clearasil was conflicted out
by a bigger company,

502
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:56,050
and I'm trying to build a business here.

503
00:31:57,175 --> 00:31:59,675
Well, what do you want?
Do you want the cough syrup?

504
00:31:59,967 --> 00:32:01,383
I want all of it.

505
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:06,842
I want the formula 44 mixture,
the cough drops, the inhaler, vaporub.

506
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,133
Who's doing a better job
for you than I have?

507
00:32:11,092 --> 00:32:14,133
Well, you've given me
something to think about.

508
00:32:15,175 --> 00:32:16,383
Really?

509
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:19,675
I think it's pretty simple. What can I get you?

510
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:24,967
Trudy, do we have any ice?

511
00:32:27,342 --> 00:32:28,967
You son of a bitch.

512
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,467
Tom, you have to come see this.

513
00:33:40,592 --> 00:33:41,592
Joyce!

514
00:33:43,508 --> 00:33:44,550
I made it.

515
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,967
You look swellegant.

516
00:33:47,842 --> 00:33:48,967
Okay.

517
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,092
Peggy works in the same building.

518
00:33:51,175 --> 00:33:53,508
Sharon was one of Davey's models.

519
00:33:54,008 --> 00:33:56,092
What did your mother say?

520
00:33:56,175 --> 00:33:57,967
She doesn't know.

521
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:01,383
What is that?

522
00:34:02,092 --> 00:34:05,508
He screws around with movies, too.
He's not as good at it.

523
00:34:06,342 --> 00:34:08,425
I can't believe how big this place is.

524
00:34:09,008 --> 00:34:10,550
I think it was a sweatshop.

525
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:14,967
Is there beer or something?
I thought I saw someone with a beer.

526
00:34:16,633 --> 00:34:19,675
Jesus. I thought I needed a lot of attention.

527
00:34:22,342 --> 00:34:27,342
Listen, I'm already high,
but this is easier than finding a beer.

528
00:34:28,175 --> 00:34:29,217
If you like it.

529
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,967
I love it.

530
00:34:45,842 --> 00:34:47,050
I'm hungry.

531
00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:51,675
I have a boyfriend.

532
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:54,258
He doesn't own your vagina.

533
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,550
No, but he's renting it.

534
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:15,550
This film is more interesting than I thought.

535
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:18,175
-it's rhythmic.
-Yeah.

536
00:36:23,175 --> 00:36:25,800
I thought I was gonna get to meet him.

537
00:36:27,592 --> 00:36:28,675
Abe!

538
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,300
Where the hell's Kellogg?

539
00:36:36,175 --> 00:36:38,925
Hey, Abe. Are you with Joyce?

540
00:36:39,217 --> 00:36:40,217
Are you?

541
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,008
-I'm Peggy.
-Peggy's a writer.

542
00:36:43,592 --> 00:36:44,842
So am I. What do you write?

543
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,675
I'm a Copywriter.

544
00:36:47,342 --> 00:36:48,425
But what do you write?

545
00:36:49,008 --> 00:36:50,300
That is writing.

546
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:52,133
You're not working on something else?

547
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,342
Davey Kellogg, this is Peggy Olson.

548
00:36:56,592 --> 00:36:58,967
-She wanted to meet you.
-I'm Catholic.

549
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,800
So, you like it?

550
00:37:01,217 --> 00:37:03,342
I don't think I'm supposed to.

551
00:37:03,425 --> 00:37:06,467
I love your nudes.
We're looking for photographers.

552
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,508
-I'm glad I was here to see this.
-Who's "we"?

553
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:13,175
I work at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.
Advertising.

554
00:37:13,758 --> 00:37:15,675
Why would I ever do that?

555
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:18,508
So you can get paid to practice your art.

556
00:37:19,008 --> 00:37:21,050
Art in advertising?

557
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:23,383
Why would anyone do that after Warhol?

558
00:37:25,175 --> 00:37:29,175
Sorry, for somebody to sell their soul,
they've got to have one.

559
00:37:30,717 --> 00:37:33,217
It's a raid!

560
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,508
It's the NYPD.

561
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,550
Wait, wait.

562
00:37:47,342 --> 00:37:50,258
-Hey, come on. Come on.
-Nobody move!

563
00:37:50,883 --> 00:37:53,967
You know, I've been arrested before.

564
00:37:55,175 --> 00:37:56,675
For what?

565
00:37:56,758 --> 00:38:02,675
I was writing about this boycott in Harlem
and they wouldn't leave, so I didn't leave.

566
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,217
Wow! Did you go to jail?

567
00:38:06,633 --> 00:38:08,175
No.

568
00:38:08,842 --> 00:38:10,842
My sister came and got me.

569
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:16,175
I feel like I should kiss you.

570
00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:32,967
Come on.

571
00:38:37,092 --> 00:38:39,925
They chased everybody
down the fire escape.

572
00:38:42,883 --> 00:38:44,008
Are they beating people?

573
00:38:44,342 --> 00:38:45,342
They took the film.

574
00:38:45,967 --> 00:38:48,300
I should see this. It could be a story.

575
00:38:48,383 --> 00:38:50,217
-How can I find you?
-I know where she is.

576
00:39:21,342 --> 00:39:22,550
Nice to see you, Ms. Blankenship.

577
00:39:22,842 --> 00:39:25,508
I look forward to hearing that every day.

578
00:39:25,592 --> 00:39:29,550
There's coffee and a roll on your desk
and Mr. Sterling would like to see you.

579
00:39:30,092 --> 00:39:31,925
Roger, he's here.

580
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,467
Could you get the others?

581
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,092
Blankenship? Boy!

582
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:47,550
Hello? Could you fetch Campbell
and Pryce, Lane, Misters.

583
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:50,508
What did you do
to make them take her out of mothballs?

584
00:39:50,592 --> 00:39:51,967
She was working in Cooper's apartment.

585
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:54,342
Allison found a better opportunity.

586
00:39:54,675 --> 00:39:56,008
Do you know he works without pants?

587
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:58,133
-Morning, Don.
-Don.

588
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,758
Morning.

589
00:39:59,842 --> 00:40:02,092
I'd like to say
in front of this informal partners meeting

590
00:40:02,175 --> 00:40:06,092
that I am in the midst of signing
Vicks Chemical, the entire cough line.

591
00:40:06,175 --> 00:40:08,467
It bills at around $6 million
and they love television.

592
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,508
It's truly spectacular news.

593
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:12,675
Congratulations. How'd you swing that?

594
00:40:12,925 --> 00:40:16,550
I guess as the president would say,
I turned chicken shit into chicken salad.

595
00:40:16,633 --> 00:40:18,258
I thought I'd kick Clearasil over to Geyer.

596
00:40:19,008 --> 00:40:20,133
Anyone but Chaough.

597
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:23,467
We're taking Philip Coakmeyer
and Tom Vogel to luncheon today.

598
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:26,300
Don't worry,
we already checked it with your girl.

599
00:40:29,508 --> 00:40:31,008
-Keep it up.
-Thank you, Don.

600
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:38,175
Please reschedule Dr. Miller.

601
00:40:42,508 --> 00:40:46,592
They're not really pornography, per se.
They're just nudes.

602
00:40:47,008 --> 00:40:48,633
They're like renaissance paintings.

603
00:40:49,175 --> 00:40:52,800
The party sounds fun.
We had nude models in school.

604
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,175
You know right away whoever
has the best drawing is going to get her.

605
00:40:55,675 --> 00:40:57,842
Did you know Malcolm X
was shot last Sunday?

606
00:40:58,342 --> 00:40:59,550
Yes, Peggy.

607
00:40:59,675 --> 00:41:01,550
Well, did you know who he was?

608
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:04,175
You ever read the stuff between the ads?

609
00:41:04,258 --> 00:41:06,800
A few of us are sending
a bottle of champagne to the Campbells'.

610
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:08,467
I'll sign the card.

611
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:11,717
-I was hoping for a contribution.
-No, thank you.

612
00:41:20,467 --> 00:41:21,508
Trudy's pregnant?

613
00:41:23,675 --> 00:41:25,300
I can't believe that guy's married to her.

614
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:31,800
I would get her so pregnant.

615
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:45,175
Hello.

616
00:41:46,217 --> 00:41:47,508
Congratulations.

617
00:41:48,217 --> 00:41:49,550
Yes.

618
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:52,175
A $6 million account
should shut Lane up for a while.

619
00:41:52,675 --> 00:41:54,675
No, I mean about the baby.

620
00:41:57,675 --> 00:42:00,550
Yes. I guess that's news.

621
00:42:01,675 --> 00:42:05,675
I just wanted to let you know
how happy I am for you both.

622
00:42:08,717 --> 00:42:10,008
Thank you.

623
00:42:41,758 --> 00:42:45,967
Dr. Miller is here to see you. It's a she.

624
00:42:48,258 --> 00:42:49,342
Send her in.

625
00:42:56,508 --> 00:42:59,050
-What do you want?
-Nothing. I moved the meeting.

626
00:43:00,175 --> 00:43:02,467
Your secretary said
you needed to see me immediately.

627
00:43:06,008 --> 00:43:08,508
We're still working things out.

628
00:43:09,175 --> 00:43:11,175
Well, I've done everything
but finish the report.

629
00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:13,175
How'd we do?

630
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:17,342
Well, it turns out
the hypothesis was rejected.

631
00:43:17,425 --> 00:43:21,550
I'd recommend a strategy that links
Pond's Cold Cream to matrimony,

632
00:43:22,175 --> 00:43:23,800
a veiled promise.

633
00:43:24,175 --> 00:43:25,592
Hello, 1925.

634
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,508
I'm not gonna do that,
so what are we gonna tell the client?

635
00:43:32,008 --> 00:43:33,675
I can't change the truth.

636
00:43:34,758 --> 00:43:36,967
How do you know that's the truth?

637
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:38,842
A new idea is something
they don't know yet,

638
00:43:38,925 --> 00:43:41,383
so of course it's not gonna
come up as an option.

639
00:43:41,467 --> 00:43:43,050
Put my campaign on IV for a year,

640
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:45,258
then hold your group again,
maybe it'll show up.

641
00:43:45,633 --> 00:43:49,592
Well, I tried everything.
I said, "Routine." I tried "ritual."

642
00:43:49,675 --> 00:43:51,092
All they care about is a husband.

643
00:43:51,175 --> 00:43:52,842
You were there.
I'll show you the transcripts.

644
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:55,092
You can't tell
how people are going to behave

645
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:56,842
based on how they have behaved.

646
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,133
Why are you being so hostile?

647
00:43:59,217 --> 00:44:00,675
You think I've never had
this argument before?

648
00:44:01,008 --> 00:44:03,717
Because you go in there
and you stick your finger in people's brains

649
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,508
and they just start talking...
Just to be heard.

650
00:44:08,092 --> 00:44:09,092
And you know what?

651
00:44:09,175 --> 00:44:12,050
Not only does it have nothing to do
with what I do, but it's nobody's business.

652
00:44:13,842 --> 00:44:15,425
Well, you're the client.

653
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,800
That's right.

654
00:44:38,675 --> 00:44:40,092
-Hello.
-It's Joyce.

655
00:44:40,175 --> 00:44:41,758
Lunch, five minutes.

656
00:44:42,592 --> 00:44:43,592
Sure.

657
00:44:43,675 --> 00:44:47,342
-Meet you in the lobby?
-No, my friends want to see Megan.

658
00:44:52,967 --> 00:44:55,758
-Pete, you remember Phil Coakmeyer.
-A pleasure to see you again.

659
00:44:55,925 --> 00:44:56,925
Shall we?

660
00:44:57,175 --> 00:44:58,675
We're just waiting on Don.

661
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,050
Hi.

662
00:45:09,967 --> 00:45:12,508
-You wanna join us?
-I can't.

663
00:45:57,133 --> 00:45:58,383
Did you get pears?

664
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,592
Did you get pears?

665
00:46:06,592 --> 00:46:08,258
Did you get pears?

666
00:46:08,425 --> 00:46:11,175
We'll discuss it inside.
