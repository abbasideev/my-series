I caught them pulling
the twin beds back apart.

And, you know, I heard
that scraping noise

in the middle of the
night when I was a kid,

24
00:00:53,209 --> 00:00:54,919

death that it was a ghost.

something much scarier:

why is my son looking

Uncomfortable, right?

50
00:01:57,313 --> 00:01:59,272
But the good thing about kids
is that when they ask a question,

51
00:01:59,356 --> 00:02:01,066
they don't really listen to the answer.

52
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,026
So, when my son asks
something uncomfortable like,

"Why doesn't Daddy live here anymore?"

But they don't know that
Joel's living with Penny.

345
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:49,360
He's not living with Penny anymore.

346
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:50,485
What? Since when?

347
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:51,695
Joel's secretary called.

348
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,113
Gave me a new home number for him.

349
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:54,615
It was his parents'.

350
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:55,616

351
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,867
I don't know.

00:12:56,951 --> 00:12:58,285
Wow.

-Mm-hmm.
-So, who else? Uh, the Gertzs.

on a very long business trip

-The Salings?

renovating the apartment

00:13:28,356 --> 00:13:29,940
Harry, good. Can we talk?

Oh, Susie. Sure.

-I have a phone.
-Well, use it.

370
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:44,330
But face-to-face is better.
That's what you always said.

371
00:13:44,414 --> 00:13:45,331
Don't listen to me.

Tell me why you're here.

-The girl?
-Yeah, the girl.

379
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,345
She's been killing at the

380
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:01,346
What's her name again?

381
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,847
It's Amanda Gleason.

382
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:03,973
Shit name.

383
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:05,809
Fake name but a great comic.

384
00:14:05,893 --> 00:14:08,144
She'd be the perfect
opening act for Sophie Lennon.

385

Get out of here.
Sophie's one of my biggest clients.

386

00:14:11,398 --> 00:14:13,566
Where do you come off,
asking for something like this?

388
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,864
I'm not talking about
opening for her at the Copa.

-Really?
-Yeah.

00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:25,536
That's a shit gig.

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,954
It's a terrible gig.

397
00:14:27,038 --> 00:14:28,497
The audience is there for Sophie.

-The opener gets eaten alive.
-We're game.

-She'd be a sacrificial lamb.

Then cut her up into chops

00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:45,764
I want this for her.

407
00:14:45,848 --> 00:14:47,516
I'd need to see her first.

I can set you up any night you like.

00:14:50,728 --> 00:14:52,646
-I'm not going to the Gaslight.
-Why not?

I don't go downtown anymore.

south as I want to go.

much as a suggestion

Oh, my first husband and me,
we didn't get along too good.

1208
00:48:30,347 --> 00:48:32,432
You double-cross me, you don't come back.

1209
00:48:32,516 --> 00:48:34,351
I told you she was spontaneous.

1210
00:48:34,435 --> 00:48:36,853
Do you have any idea what it
means to be on my bad side?

1211
00:48:36,937 --> 00:48:39,064
-I don't want to be on your bad side.
-This town

1212
00:48:39,148 --> 00:48:40,982
is gonna become a
very uncomfortable place

1213
00:48:41,066 --> 00:48:42,401
for you two, Susie.

1214
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:44,444
Fucking count on it.

1215
00:48:44,528 --> 00:48:46,905
MIDGE: …Sophie and my mother.

1216
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:49,741
Now there's a pair.

1217
00:48:49,825 --> 00:48:51,618
Let's get those two together.

1218
00:48:51,702 --> 00:48:54,788
Maybe my mother will move
into Sophie's unoccupied kitchen

1219
00:48:54,872 --> 00:48:58,165
and together they can eat
lemon wedges for eternity!

1220
00:48:58,249 --> 00:48:59,917
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

1221
00:49:00,001 --> 00:49:04,547
As long as the lemons are
the best lemons in the world.

1222
00:49:04,631 --> 00:49:07,007
Oh, I'm just getting started here.

1223
00:49:07,091 --> 00:49:09,761
You don't have anywhere
to go, do you, guys?
