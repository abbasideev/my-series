No.

could handle it on my own.

overzealous police officer.

Effectively, this was entrapment.

I don't hate the police, Your Honor,

559
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:18,152

out that no other witness

560

make any sort of complaint.

Yes, Your Honor.

00:19:26,494 --> 00:19:28,996
But the court does acknowledge
your standing in the community,

-I can swing it.
-You can swing for that,

700
00:23:58,606 --> 00:24:00,107
but not for a better suit?

701
00:24:00,191 --> 00:24:01,442
-My suits are fine, Moishe.
-Your suits are old.

702
00:24:01,526 --> 00:24:02,860
My suits are good.

703
00:24:04,445 --> 00:24:07,114
[SIGHS] You know…

704
00:24:07,198 --> 00:24:09,158
-Ah, I shouldn't say it.
-No.

705
00:24:09,242 --> 00:24:10,451
No, go ahead, say it.

706
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:11,785
I never thought you liked me so much.

707
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:14,413
No. I like you very much, Moishe.

708
00:24:14,497 --> 00:24:16,665
I don't know.
We invite you over, you never come.

709
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:19,084
Well, school keeps me busy.

-And maybe it's me,

712

to have a weird attitude

713

whenever I brought up the 13.

714

-You know what I'm talking about?
-Uh…

715
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,847
The 13 people I got
out of Germany in '43…

716
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:33,266
No, I know who they are…

717
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,436

sacrifice, I did that, Abe.

718

for the great sacrifice you made

719
00:24:39,648 --> 00:24:41,816

out of Germany, Moishe.

-Yes, very much.

-When was the last time you came home

735

-Fairly recently.

Your money's no good here.

All right. Now, that's very nice of you,

Oh, no, I wouldn't hear of it.

741
00:25:24,444 --> 00:25:26,112
[LAUGHING] Well.

742

745

-Oh, Joel will come back.
-What do you mean?

746
00:25:41,796 --> 00:25:43,338
I mean, I know my son.

747
00:25:43,422 --> 00:25:44,840
Follow-through's never
been his strong suit.

748
00:25:44,924 --> 00:25:48,260
Tell Rosie not to worry, he'll be back.

749
00:25:49,762 --> 00:25:51,263

750
00:25:51,347 --> 00:25:52,723
Ha, ha.

751
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:54,266
Yeah, Tuesday's fine.

752
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,311
I got a four o'clock
call, then I'm in the clear.

She's okay?

758

She's okay.

759
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:35,767
Welcome back, Mrs. Maisel.

760

payment on your fine,

761

and that you have something
you'd like to say to the court.

762
00:26:41,815 --> 00:26:43,524
Yes, Your Honor.

763
00:26:43,608 --> 00:26:47,362
My behavior earlier today was irrational.

764
00:26:47,446 --> 00:26:49,146
JUDGE: Could you speak up, please?

765
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,867
[LOUDER] My behavior earlier today

766
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:57,414
was irrational, irresponsible

767
00:26:57,498 --> 00:27:00,334
and extremely disrespectful.

768
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:03,420
I let my emotions get the better of me.

769
00:27:03,504 --> 00:27:06,090
After all, I am a woman.

770
00:27:06,174 --> 00:27:09,259
And therefore, I humbly apologize.

771
00:27:09,343 --> 00:27:11,678
Good, good.

772
00:27:11,762 --> 00:27:14,473
Now my original inclination
was to dismiss these charges,

773
00:27:14,557 --> 00:27:19,061
but in view of what happened
here today, I offer this:

774
00:27:19,145 --> 00:27:22,564
plead guilty, and you'll be
sentenced to time served.

775
00:27:22,648 --> 00:27:24,775
Otherwise, you can risk trial,

776
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:27,444
where the maximum fine
will be a thousand dollars

777
00:27:27,528 --> 00:27:29,488
and up to three months in jail.

778
00:27:29,572 --> 00:27:31,950
-Three months?
-Now, as you consider this,

779
00:27:32,034 --> 00:27:33,952
please think long and hard

780
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:36,413
about how generous I'm feeling right now,

781
00:27:36,497 --> 00:27:41,126
and about how easy it would
be to make me angry again.

782
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,046
I plead guilty, Your Honor.

783
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,506
JUDGE: Good!

784
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,299
The defendant pleads
guilty on all counts,

785
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:50,802
and she is sentenced to time served.

786
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:51,970
Thank you, Your Honor.

787
00:27:52,054 --> 00:27:53,471
Yes, thank you, Your Honor.

788

up for this my entire life.

804

and I swear to you, it is gonna work.

JOEL: All right, just keep in mind

806
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,788
that Dow Chemical always
slows down around the holidays.

-No, no, I got it.

1221
00:44:38,169 --> 00:44:39,712
DRIVER: Thanks.

1222
00:44:46,427 --> 00:44:48,429
You been downtown?

1223
00:44:48,513 --> 00:44:51,390
Uh, no. Laundry day.

1224
00:44:51,474 --> 00:44:53,350
What are you doing here?

1225
00:44:53,434 --> 00:44:56,061
Midge…

1226
00:44:56,145 --> 00:44:58,856
I've been thinking a
lot about our situation

1227
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,566
where we are.

1228
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,568
I'm on a couch.

1229
00:45:02,652 --> 00:45:05,321
And you, I mean, I don't
know what happened today.

1230
00:45:05,405 --> 00:45:06,864
I don't know what you
needed the money for,

1231
00:45:06,948 --> 00:45:08,282
and I don't care.

1232
00:45:08,366 --> 00:45:10,242
I promised I wouldn't ask.

1233
00:45:10,326 --> 00:45:12,578
But clearly, things aren't going great

1234
00:45:12,662 --> 00:45:14,748
for either one of us.

1235
00:45:14,832 --> 00:45:17,751
Maybe this was a mistake.

1236
00:45:17,835 --> 00:45:20,795
So…

1237
00:45:20,879 --> 00:45:23,424
I'm thinking of giving it another go.

Papa?

1240
00:45:40,149 --> 00:45:41,525
What are you doing down here?

1241
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:45,487
Well, I brought Ethan
down a few hours ago.

1242
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:47,364
He likes his bed,

1243
00:45:47,448 --> 00:45:50,450
and he was staring at
Rose in a very weird way.

1244
00:45:50,534 --> 00:45:52,870
Sure, yeah.

1245
00:45:52,954 --> 00:45:55,373
Are you okay?

1246
00:45:56,374 --> 00:45:57,917
Joel was downstairs.

1247
00:45:58,001 --> 00:45:59,461
Here?

1248
00:46:01,463 --> 00:46:03,297
What did he want?

1249
00:46:03,381 --> 00:46:05,883
He wanted to give it another go.

1250
00:46:05,967 --> 00:46:07,135
Really?

1251
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:14,850
Well… what did you say?

1252
00:46:14,934 --> 00:46:17,103
No.
