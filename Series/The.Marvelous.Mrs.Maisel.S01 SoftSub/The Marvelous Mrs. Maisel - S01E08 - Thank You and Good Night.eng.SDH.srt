00:28:17,132 --> 00:28:18,758
You're supposed to go on at 8:00.

703
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:21,428
When you said "shit gig,"
this is exactly what I pictured.

704
00:28:21,512 --> 00:28:23,721
Yeah, this place is
pretty much the worst.

705
00:28:23,805 --> 00:28:25,723
Now, remember, the audience
out there will be terrible.

706
00:28:25,807 --> 00:28:26,975
All right? They're gonna be drunk,

707
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:28,768
horny and in no mood to laugh.

708
00:28:28,852 --> 00:28:30,478
There's pretty much no chance
you're gonna win them over,

709
00:28:30,562 --> 00:28:32,188
even if you do show them your tits,

710
00:28:32,272 --> 00:28:34,650
'cause there's a lot of
tits to look at in here.

711
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:37,360
I'm sorry, was that
the end of the pep talk?

712
00:28:37,444 --> 00:28:38,778
Just keep going.

713
00:28:38,862 --> 00:28:40,447
No matter what they
toss at you, keep going.

714
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:42,824
-Okay.
-Duck, you know, but keep going.

715
00:28:44,326 --> 00:28:46,619
-So, Susie.
-Yes?

716
00:28:46,703 --> 00:28:48,580
I'm gonna tell you something.

717
00:28:48,664 --> 00:28:48,763
Okay.

718
00:28:48,847 --> 00:28:50,498
I'm just gonna say it,
because I want you to hear it,

719
00:28:50,582 --> 00:28:52,041
and after I say it and after you hear it,

720
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:53,376
we are not gonna discuss it again.

721
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,419
I just want you to hear it,

722
00:28:55,503 --> 00:28:56,670
because we are in business together,

723
00:28:56,754 --> 00:28:57,963
and we spend time together

724
00:28:58,047 --> 00:29:00,215
and it could come up occasionally.

725
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,341
And I don't want to
keep anything from you.

726
00:29:01,425 --> 00:29:02,676
But I don't want you to be surprised

727
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,927
-if I accidentally…
-What is this?

728
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:05,137
The lost Hamlet monologue?

729
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:06,388
Just say it, for Christ's sake.

730
00:29:06,472 --> 00:29:07,890
I spent the night with Joel.

731
00:29:07,974 --> 00:29:10,684
After Ethan's party, he spent the night.

732
00:29:10,768 --> 00:29:14,021
And we… spent the night.

733
00:29:14,105 --> 00:29:15,230
So there.

734
00:29:15,314 --> 00:29:16,857
I told you. You know it.

735
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:18,791
We are not gonna talk about it again.

736
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,155

737
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,657

738
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:27,409
You slept with your husband?

739
00:29:27,493 --> 00:29:28,577
He was such an asshole.

We are not gonna talk about it.

741
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:31,663
Are you getting back together with him?

742
00:29:31,747 --> 00:29:33,581
I just thought I should
tell you in case it came up…

743
00:29:33,665 --> 00:29:34,790
In case what?

744
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:36,334

-Not talking about it.

-Not talking about.

We'll continue not talking
about it when I get back.

749

You slept with your husband?

750
00:29:50,015 --> 00:29:52,308
Yes.

751
00:29:52,392 --> 00:29:54,894
Aren't you supposed to sleep
with your husband? I'm confused.

752
00:29:54,978 --> 00:29:57,063
Well, we've been separated for a while,

753
00:29:57,147 --> 00:29:58,773
so it was, it was a little unexpected.

it pretty well, considering.

-Just get it. Let's go.
-Susie.

What are you talking about, "canceled"?

00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:23,838

Are you kidding? How did he even know

774
00:30:30,054 --> 00:30:31,304
about this stupid gig?

775
00:30:31,388 --> 00:30:33,848
-Oh, I told him.
-Why?

'Cause I'm the world's biggest idiot.

And you can bet if he
cost us this loser gig,

he's probably gonna cost
us the other loser gig, also.

Amanda Gleason, not me.

name to Trudy Macintosh.

Well, he knows my name, Trudy.

782
00:30:45,986 --> 00:30:48,655
And they're not dealing with
me, and I'm your manager. Right?

Always with the books, geez.

Congratulations, mademoiselle.

-A Viv special?
-A Viv special.

884
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:35,459
I can smell it from here.

885
00:34:35,543 --> 00:34:37,085
I want postcards from Paris.

886
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:38,252
Mais oui.

887
00:34:38,336 --> 00:34:39,378
Hey!

888
00:34:39,462 --> 00:34:41,088
Penny.

889
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:41,682
What are you…

890
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:43,591
I have been all over
town looking for you.

891
00:34:43,675 --> 00:34:45,718
-Penny, I'm working right now.
-Oh, I know.

892
00:34:45,802 --> 00:34:47,386
I know you're working
because Joel said you worked

893
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:48,679
in a department store.

894
00:34:48,763 --> 00:34:50,056
He just didn't say which one.

895
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,266
So I went to all of them.

896
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,560
I went to Saks. I went to Bergdorf's.

897
00:34:54,644 --> 00:34:56,813
I went to Macy's. I went to Gimbels.

898
00:34:56,897 --> 00:34:59,148
They're across the street from
each other, so that was easy.

899
00:34:59,232 --> 00:35:00,399
I went to Lord & Taylor's.

900
00:35:00,483 --> 00:35:01,609
I went to Bendel's,
even though I thought,

901
00:35:01,693 --> 00:35:02,693
"She wouldn't shop at Bendel's,"

902
00:35:02,777 --> 00:35:03,945
but it's not really about

903
00:35:04,029 --> 00:35:05,530
where you would shop, is it?

904
00:35:05,614 --> 00:35:07,365
-Not really. Look, can we…
-I almost gave up.

905
00:35:07,449 --> 00:35:10,076
But I decided, "No,
I'll give it one more try."

906
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,286
And I came here, and here you are.

907
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:15,206
-Yes. Look…
-I know all about you and Joel.

908
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,123
I know that you spent the night together.

909
00:35:17,207 --> 00:35:18,834
And I think that's rotten. It's mean

910
00:35:18,918 --> 00:35:20,710
and it's spiteful and vindictive

911
00:35:20,794 --> 00:35:22,128
and I don't understand why you'd do it.

912
00:35:22,212 --> 00:35:23,588
Wow. Where's a fainting
couch when you need one?

913
00:35:23,672 --> 00:35:25,465
Joel and I were happy.

914
00:35:25,549 --> 00:35:26,883
-Oh, boy.
-I made him happy.

915
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:28,802
-He moved out, Penny.
-Not really.

916
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:30,428
-Are his things there?
-There's socks.

917
00:35:30,512 --> 00:35:32,639
Socks? Or just a sock?

918
00:35:32,723 --> 00:35:34,182
He moved out. You broke up.

919
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,600
No. We did not break up.

920
00:35:35,684 --> 00:35:37,727
Joel never said the words, "We broke up."

921
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:39,771
-What words did he say?
-Other words.

922
00:35:39,855 --> 00:35:41,314
Other words that basically
amount to "we broke up"?

923
00:35:41,398 --> 00:35:42,983
I was good for him.

924
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:45,026
Better for him than you were.
He relaxed around me.

925
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,987
He'd come home at
night and fall right to sleep.

926
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:48,697
Boy, you are making it way too easy.

927
00:35:48,781 --> 00:35:50,156
If you had just let go, if you had just…

928
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,575
He never took off his wedding ring.

929
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:52,993
You didn't think that was strange?

930
00:35:53,077 --> 00:35:55,411
The stress of everything
made his fingers swell.

931
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:58,998
Penny, you don't really
believe that, do you?

932
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,419
He would've forgotten you.

933
00:36:03,503 --> 00:36:06,380
You just did something.

934
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,591
You need to go.

935
00:36:08,675 --> 00:36:11,886
You did sleep together, didn't you?

936
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,763
-Yes.
-Tramp!

937
00:36:14,847 --> 00:36:16,807
That's what I went to seven different

938
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:18,142
department stores to say!

939
00:36:18,226 --> 00:36:20,895
You are a tramp!

940
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:25,274
We need to have a talk.

941
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:27,443
Bring your handbook.

942
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:36,826
What do you do?

943
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,202
Spoken word with tambourine.

944
00:36:38,286 --> 00:36:39,996
Your parents must be thrilled.

945
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,248
Okay. 8:30.

946
00:36:42,332 --> 00:36:43,416
Can I get some change?

947
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,918
Fuck off.

948
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:47,712
Oh, yeah. Singles okay?

949
00:36:47,796 --> 00:36:48,713
What do you do?

950
00:36:48,797 --> 00:36:50,715
Carter Family covers.

951
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:52,467
11:30.

952
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:54,302
How'd you get Imogene to let
you come out with me tonight?

953
00:36:54,386 --> 00:36:55,845
I explained this is a big deal for you.

954
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:57,722
You needed your second by your side.

955
00:36:57,806 --> 00:36:59,390
So if I bomb, you're going up?

956
00:36:59,474 --> 00:37:00,975
Nope. You bomb, I look the other way.

957
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:03,686
Never met you.

958
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,355
Hi, there.

959
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:07,440
-Remember me?
-No.

960
00:37:07,524 --> 00:37:09,692
-I'm the one with the brisket.
-No.

961
00:37:09,776 --> 00:37:11,526
Actually, my wife
would bring the brisket,

962
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,612
but it was for me to get me a spot.

963
00:37:13,696 --> 00:37:16,031
So, how about I owe you a
brisket and you give me a spot?

964
00:37:16,115 --> 00:37:17,240
No.

965
00:37:17,324 --> 00:37:20,535
Okay. Hey, that is a great blouse.

966
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:21,703
Barking up the wrong tree, pal.

967
00:37:21,787 --> 00:37:23,747
Right. Look, I'd really love a spot.

968
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:25,332
Anything you could do?

969
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:27,417
I don't give out the spots anymore.

970
00:37:27,501 --> 00:37:28,669
Got to talk to him.

971
00:37:28,753 --> 00:37:30,003
Tell him he's got a nice ass.

972
00:37:30,087 --> 00:37:31,713
That usually works.

973
00:37:31,797 --> 00:37:34,508
Okay, thanks.

974
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,259
Hi.

975
00:37:36,343 --> 00:37:38,512
I'm a comedian. I'd like a slot tonight.

976
00:37:38,596 --> 00:37:39,721
Sorry, pal. All full.

977
00:37:39,805 --> 00:37:41,682
You sure?

978
00:37:41,766 --> 00:37:46,019
Just gave the last one
to that guy or that guy.

979
00:37:46,103 --> 00:37:48,771
I don't know.
One of those guys got the last slot.

980
00:37:48,855 --> 00:37:51,273
What if I come back tonight
just in case someone drops out?

981
00:37:51,357 --> 00:37:54,068
That's a pretty fucking stupid idea.

982
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:55,736
Okay. Then I'll try again tomorrow.

983
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,530
And the next day, and the day after that

984
00:37:57,614 --> 00:37:59,198
because I am going to get a slot

985
00:37:59,282 --> 00:38:01,742
and I am going to get
back up on that stage.

986
00:38:01,826 --> 00:38:03,160
Cue the orchestra.

987
00:38:03,244 --> 00:38:06,163
What do I care?
Come back whenever you want.

988
00:38:06,247 --> 00:38:07,665
Let's go, Arch.

989
00:38:07,749 --> 00:38:09,041
Mr. Persistency.

990
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:10,376
This is what Midge wanted.

991
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,003
She wanted me to be a comedian

992
00:38:12,087 --> 00:38:13,462
and I just didn't try hard enough.

993
00:38:13,546 --> 00:38:15,464
So, now, I do this for Midge

994
00:38:15,548 --> 00:38:19,010
because from now on, she
gets everything she wants.

995
00:38:21,846 --> 00:38:23,264
MIDGE: Papa?

996
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:32,605
[THUMPING]

997
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:34,274
Papa?

998
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:36,068
ABE: Yes?

999
00:38:38,112 --> 00:38:39,404
What are you doing?

1000
00:38:39,488 --> 00:38:41,322
Alphabetizing my books.

1001
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:43,533
Can I talk to you for a moment?

1002
00:38:43,617 --> 00:38:46,036
Okay.

1003
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,163
Are you… yo… you're gonna do it from there?

1004
00:38:48,247 --> 00:38:50,457
I think that's what
we're looking at, yes.

1005
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:52,083
Okay.

1006
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:57,172
Well, I just wanted to
tell you that Joel and I

1007
00:38:57,256 --> 00:38:59,007
might be getting back together.

1008
00:38:59,091 --> 00:39:03,678
Are you kidding me?

1009
00:39:03,762 --> 00:39:07,473
After what you put your
mother and me through,

1010
00:39:07,557 --> 00:39:09,600
you have the nerve to
come in here and tell me

1011
00:39:09,684 --> 00:39:11,894
you're getting back together?

1012
00:39:11,978 --> 00:39:14,438
-I…
-She's not speaking to me.

1013
00:39:14,522 --> 00:39:16,482
She took my study. Look at me.

1014
00:39:16,566 --> 00:39:19,109
Look at what I have
to do every single day

1015
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:20,652
because you wouldn't let Joel come back!

1016
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:22,613
-I'm sorry.
-No!

1017
00:39:22,697 --> 00:39:25,282
-"No" what?
-No, I forbid it.

1018
00:39:25,366 --> 00:39:27,910
You forbid me to get back
together with my husband?

1019
00:39:27,994 --> 00:39:30,287
Yes, I forbid it.

1020
00:39:30,371 --> 00:39:33,916
You have laid waste to
everyone and everything

1021
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,876
around you.

1022
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,461
It's been like a typhoon.

1023
00:39:37,545 --> 00:39:39,671
The Red Cross should
start handing out blankets.

1024
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:41,632
You have ruined everybody's life

1025
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:44,926
and now that there's
no more havoc to wreak,

1026
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,344
you want to get back together

1027
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:49,138
and be happy. No.

1028
00:39:49,222 --> 00:39:53,351
You don't get to be happy
until I can get to my piano!

1029
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:55,645
Papa, I am so sorry.

1030
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:58,439
I really am.
I… I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

1031
00:39:58,523 --> 00:40:00,858
I didn't mean to upset your lives.

1032
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:02,401
ABE: Ugh.

1033
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:05,071
I've just missed him so much.

1034
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:07,406
I miss being married.

1035
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:11,244
I miss having someone to laugh with,

1036
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:14,122
someone next to me at night.

1037
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:16,917
Are you sure?

1038
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,837
I love him.

1039
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:27,300
Goddamn it! Goddamn it! I'm fine.

1040
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:29,594
Oy.

1041
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:32,848
And I thought your teenage
years were a problem.

1042
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:35,433
Well, look on the bright side.

1043
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:36,643
Still might not happen.

1044
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:38,687
Don't tease.

1045
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:43,775
I'm a different person
now than when he left.

1046
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,610
He might not like the new me.

1047
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:48,530
People change.

1048
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:55,120
You know who your mother
was when I first met her?

1049
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:58,832
She had just come back from France.

1050
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:02,918
She smoked cigarettes.

1051
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,421
