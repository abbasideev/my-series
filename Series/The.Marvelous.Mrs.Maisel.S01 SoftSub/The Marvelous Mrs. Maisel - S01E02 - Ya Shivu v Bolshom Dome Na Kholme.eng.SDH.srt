00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:13,089
Richard went straight
to a lawyer's office

178
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:14,923
with his suitcase and his portable bar,

179
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:17,134
and just like that, three became four.

180
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:18,301
Now five.

181
00:08:18,385 --> 00:08:20,095
Who knows besides me?

182
00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:23,223
My parents. Joel, Archie.

183
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:24,974
Well, we won't tell.

184
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:26,642
People will find out, eventually.

185
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:29,145
I should just come out
with it and tell everyone

186
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:30,479
and get it over with.

187
00:08:30,563 --> 00:08:33,065
All right, let's think this through.

188
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:34,607
If you do tell people, then at least

189
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:35,650
you could control the narrative.

190
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:37,110
You know what I mean

191
00:08:37,194 --> 00:08:38,862
frame yourself in the best light.

192
00:08:38,946 --> 00:08:40,989
Done right, maybe you just
get pushed back a row or two,

193
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:42,449
not all the way into "the corner."

194
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:43,700
Maybe.

195
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:45,451
Unless you think Joel is coming back.

196
00:08:45,535 --> 00:08:47,035
'Cause if you think he's
coming back, then it's better

197
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,620
you don't tell anybody,
because then he'll be back,

198
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:50,247
and no one will have known he left.

199
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,124
But if you tell them he left,
and then he comes back,

200
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,042
you'll still be the person that
he left, only now he's back.

201
00:08:54,126 --> 00:08:55,293
But they'll know that you were left,

202
00:08:55,377 --> 00:08:56,711
even though you aren't left now.

203
00:08:56,795 --> 00:08:57,837
And I don't know what corner of the room

204
00:08:57,921 --> 00:08:59,130
you stand in to be that person.

205
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:01,675

Half of those people
out there are gentiles.

No, I'm not a nonbeliever.
I am a believer.

-Abe canceled dinner?
-No.

-A holy dinner, he cancels.
-It's not Abe.

Your mother's very upset.
Does Abe know that?

So much crying.

A good 40 to 50 minutes of crying.

00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,106
No.

350
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,025
-Did you know the answer?
-No.

351
00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:48,068
No? Did you know the answer?

352
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:49,612
-No.
-No.

353
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:52,072
So none of you knew the answer.

354
00:14:52,156 --> 00:14:53,990
-ALL: No.
-But Truman.

355
00:14:54,074 --> 00:14:56,075
But we could have known the answer.
That's the point.

356
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,077
Could have?

357
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:00,622
Could have. Charlie…

358
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:01,211
Lance.

359
00:15:01,295 --> 00:15:05,250
Could have doesn't count.
Maybe doesn't count.

360
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:07,669
"I took a shot" doesn't count.

361
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:10,714
Because this room is a sanctuary

362
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:13,342
from the variables in the outside world.

363
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:16,886
In this room, we deal with absolutes.

364
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,846
Period.

365
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:23,184
In this room… this is what counts.

366
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:27,854
These two vectors are collinear.

367
00:15:27,938 --> 00:15:31,399
They go… together.

368
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:34,109
And they will always go together.

369
00:15:34,193 --> 00:15:37,655
This is the solemn vow
made by mathematics.

370
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:42,117
In this room, v-two is never
going to break that vow

371
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:44,619
and decide that it doesn't
need the other vector anymore,

372
00:15:44,703 --> 00:15:47,622
that it's gonna run off and
become linearly independent.

373
00:15:47,706 --> 00:15:50,416
V-two is never going to
come home from work one day

374
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,169
and tell v-one, "You know what?

375
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:56,505
"I think I need my own vector space.

376
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,841
See ya."

377
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:02,177
And then v-one's dad has
to come in and tell her, "No,

378
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,053
"you can't let v-two do that.

379
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:06,889
You… You got to go get v-two back,"

380
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:08,558
an impermanent solution,

381
00:16:08,642 --> 00:16:13,104
because v-one's dad is
not gonna be around forever

382
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:17,065
to solve all of v-one's problems.

383

[CHALK WRITING ON BOARD]

And just like that, Joel left,
in the middle of the night,

394
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,609
-like a cat burglar.
-DRINA: God, that's terrible.

395
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:07,193
I'm so surprised. He seemed

396
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,446
so crazy about Midge.
You want sugar today?

397
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,114
No. Maybe a lump.

398
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,699
-Two lumps.
-I put in three.

399
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:14,617
It's a stressful time.

400
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,411
-Drink.
-Mm.

401
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,205
How is poor Miriam?

402
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,999
Oh, who can tell with her?

403
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,083
You know, maybe I sensed something.

404
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:26,753
But just last week, I told
her to get pregnant again.

405
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,463
Hmm. Too hot.

406
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,798
I told her, "Three before 30."
That was my mistake.

407
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,800
I waited too long
between Miriam and Noah.

408
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:35,344
-I could only fit in two.
-You need to drink the tea, honey.

409
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:36,762
But Miriam is Miriam.

410
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:38,555
She wanted to play and run around

411
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:41,350
dressed in black like a Fellini film.

412
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:43,184
It's fine now.

413
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:44,894
There's beer in her refrigerator.

414
00:17:44,978 --> 00:17:46,771
-Oh, dear.
-Joel thinks she's frivolous.

415
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:49,023
-That's why he left.
-She's always been her own girl.

416
00:17:49,107 --> 00:17:49,208
Mm.

417
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:51,651
Do you remember when
she wanted to learn to drive?

418
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:53,652
Because she found pink driving gloves.

419
00:17:53,736 --> 00:17:55,612
Everything with Midge
starts with an accessory.

420
00:17:55,696 --> 00:17:57,280
How's Abe taking all this?

421
00:17:57,364 --> 00:17:59,199
Abe got up this morning and went to work.

422
00:17:59,283 --> 00:18:01,910
The world could be ending,
and he'd get up and go to work.

423
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:04,161
And if Columbia University
fell into the ocean,

424
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:06,497
he'd work from home.

425
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:10,209
-Here.
-Does the rabbi know?

426
00:18:10,293 --> 00:18:11,752
-What? No. God, no.
-Good.

427
00:18:11,836 --> 00:18:14,253
-Can you imagine?
-I don't want to.

428
00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:15,672
We're all sick. That's what he knows.

429
00:18:15,756 --> 00:18:17,382
Very, very sick.
You did not see me today.

430
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:20,134
Who am I talking to?
No one. I'm alone here.

431
00:18:20,218 --> 00:18:22,804
Okay, let's take a look at this.

432
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:24,596
I failed her. I failed her somehow.

433
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,098
My whole family, everyone's married.

434
00:18:26,182 --> 00:18:28,016
Abe's family, everyone's married.

435
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,644
I should've sent her to Paris.
My mother sent me to Paris.

436
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:33,479
Paris is wonderful, but
it's good Midge didn't go.

437
00:18:33,563 --> 00:18:35,272
There was danger for her there.

438
00:18:35,356 --> 00:18:37,525
-Too much bread.
-Yes.

439
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:39,276
Okay, let's see.

440
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,153
I just need to know whether or not

441
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:42,947
this separation is
actually going to happen.

442
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:44,698
-I see a hammer.
-Is a hammer good?

443
00:18:44,782 --> 00:18:46,282
It is if you want to hang a picture.

444
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:48,201
Please, Drina…

445
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:51,246
A hammer means triumph. You will triumph.

446
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:57,209
And the leaves say this journey
will end in peace and happiness.

447
00:18:57,293 --> 00:18:59,962
Triumph? Peace and happiness?
You're sure?

448
00:19:00,046 --> 00:19:02,506
-You're doubting the leaves?
-No. Never.

449
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,716
Okay, you're still nervous.
Drina knows this.

450
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,300
I'll tell you what.

451
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:08,594
I'll throw in a charm. Put this

452
00:19:08,678 --> 00:19:11,848
under Miriam's pillow for a week.

453
00:19:11,932 --> 00:19:13,432
It'll help the luck stick.

454
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:15,100
My God, what is that smell?

455
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:16,476
Tannis root. Just tell Miriam

456
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,729
a rat died in the wall or something.

457
00:19:18,813 --> 00:19:20,814
-Thank you, Drina.
-Don't worry.

458
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:22,940
Miriam will land on her feet.

-Some guy showed up here looking for you.

463
00:19:38,372 --> 00:19:40,874
I asked him to wait down
here, but he pushed right past.

00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,584
-Almost bit me.
-Oh, no.

-Hey, I'm calling the cops right now.
-Don't call the cops.

I didn't even tell you where my door was.

It is so much better
that you just forgot.

I had no idea you were
such an important person.

If I had realized that the queen
of England had stood me up,

497
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:45,723
I would have understood.
But I just thought

498
00:20:45,807 --> 00:20:47,558
you were some drunk
housewife who needed my help.

499

I had no idea you were
related to fucking Charlemagne.

Great had shown up and said,

probably wouldn't have expected

502

her to show up either.
But you have to tell people who you are.

'Cause if all they
have to go on is the fact

they're just gonna think
you're a stuck-up twat.

It's an easy mistake to make.

00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:32,599
Where has his hand been that
it is now currently very sticky?

520
00:21:32,683 --> 00:21:34,142
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]

521
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,519
-Hi, lady.
-Why am I still holding this child?

522
00:21:36,603 --> 00:21:38,187
He can't find his way home from here?

523
00:21:38,271 --> 00:21:40,064
I made it home just fine
when my mother forgot me

524
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:41,482
at the Armistice Day Parade.

525
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,316
An old soldier with one
arm gave me a nickel

526
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,318
and I took the bus home.
Oh, you're welcome!

527
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:47,946
Real polite kid you got there. Good job.

528
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,364
Would you like some iced tea?

529
00:21:49,448 --> 00:21:50,949
Hmm. Do I want some iced tea?

530
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:52,575
Let me think. Fuck you.

531
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:55,244
No, I do not want any iced tea.

532
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,246
[SCOFFS] First, you stand me up.

533
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,915
Then you Bataan Death March
me through Buckingham Palace.

534
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:01,667
You make me hold your kid's filthy hand,

535
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:03,459
which means I probably got
14 different kinds of cholera

536
00:22:03,543 --> 00:22:05,461
-right now.
-Sit down. I'll get us some iced tea.

537
00:22:05,545 --> 00:22:07,714
Sit where? Here? What, on this?
Are you kidding me?

538
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:09,048
I'm not sitting in here.

539
00:22:09,132 --> 00:22:10,383
This is not furniture for sitting!

540
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:11,801
This is furniture you get appraised

541
00:22:11,885 --> 00:22:13,135
when a rich uncle dies.

542
00:22:13,219 --> 00:22:14,720
You really should put plastic

543
00:22:14,804 --> 00:22:16,513
-over all of this.
-It's fine.

544
00:22:16,597 --> 00:22:18,432
Are those two really your children

545
00:22:18,516 --> 00:22:20,767
or did we just break in
and kidnap a couple kids?

546
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:23,436
-Of course they're mine.
-Well, just making sure.

547
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,438
I mean, when you
fraternize with an ex-con…

548
00:22:25,522 --> 00:22:28,024
Hey, did you know that I have
to get a lawyer and go to court?

549
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:28,256
Yes.

550
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,027
Even though I got bailed
out on the night I got arrested.

551
00:22:31,111 --> 00:22:32,861
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

552
00:22:32,945 --> 00:22:35,363
-So it's not a thing?
-No, it's not a thing.

553
00:22:35,447 --> 00:22:37,324
Why do I have it in my
head that it's a thing?

554
00:22:37,408 --> 00:22:40,160
I don't know, lady.
Maybe it's all that royal inbreeding.

555
00:22:40,244 --> 00:22:42,494
This is not that fancy of
an apartment. [CHUCKLES]

556
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:44,914
It's just ridiculous.
That whole getting arrested thing.

557
00:22:44,998 --> 00:22:46,582
So I said some bad words.

558
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,083
Well, and you flashed the room.

559
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,335
What?

560
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:50,586
You flashed the room.

561
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,837
You pulled your top down.

562
00:22:51,921 --> 00:22:53,838
-Oh, I did not.
-You did, too.

563
00:22:53,922 --> 00:22:55,840
You hit a switch and out they came.

-That's ridiculous.
-"Soup's on, boys!"

-If I did that, I'd remember.
-Mm.

566
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,596
-Cake?
-No, I do not want cake.

567
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,680
You know what, I would
like to know what I am doing…

568
00:23:03,764 --> 00:23:04,765
Oh, wow.

569
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:06,516
That… That is an adorable cake.

570
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,060
I'm sorry about today.

571
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:09,394
I really am.

572
00:23:09,478 --> 00:23:10,979
Okay.

573
00:23:11,063 --> 00:23:13,314
Let's just forget about
this morning, okay?

574
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:15,775
I'm here. We can start now.

575
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:17,026
You have any paper? Pen?

576
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,528
Maybe parchment and a quill?

577
00:23:19,612 --> 00:23:20,905
-Why?
-So I can write down some stuff for you

578
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:22,530
-to talk about onstage.
-No, no, no.

579
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:23,949
Look, I'm… I'm sorry about this morning,

580
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:26,785
but that woman last
night, she was not me.

This is me. I am me.

-Uh-huh.
-I'm the woman who's gonna be standing

583
00:23:30,497 --> 00:23:32,414
in the corner next to Martha Kilgallin,

584
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:34,708
-desperate and sweating like a pig.
-There are two Ls

585
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:36,794
-in "Kilgallin"?
-I'm the woman who's gonna get elbowed

586
00:23:36,878 --> 00:23:38,629
out of the way at the butcher
shop so that other women

587
00:23:38,713 --> 00:23:40,547
can get the best lamb chops.
Other women who have husbands

588
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:43,299
to shop for. Nobody cares if
you're ordering steak for one.

589
00:23:43,383 --> 00:23:45,718
That… That's me.
That's the real me we're dealing with.

590
00:23:45,802 --> 00:23:48,805
And she's not fun.
She's sad and embarrassed

591
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:50,473

00:23:50,557 --> 00:23:51,849
I'm making notes. This is great stuff.

593
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:53,267
This is not great stuff.

594
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:55,602
This is my life falling apart.

595
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:57,813
My husband left me.
Do you understand that?

596
00:23:57,897 --> 00:24:00,399
He left me, left my children.
You've met my children.

597
00:24:00,483 --> 00:24:02,358
I did. One of 'em gave me bubonic plague.

00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,360
It was jelly, goddamn it.

00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,487
-on their hands.
-Okay. Relax.

00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:08,656
The woman who showed up at
that club and said those crazy things

601
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,907
was in a state.

602
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:12,118
A manic emotional state.

00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,663
Yes!
For a moment it… it was glorious, okay?

605
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,748
F… For one moment, I said and did things

606
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,750
that I've never done or said before.

607
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,835

complete blur to me now.

I don't know how I got there.

609
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:26,588
I wouldn't know how to get there again.

610
00:24:26,672 --> 00:24:29,300
And I'm not gonna try. Do you understand?

611
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,677
Yeah.

612
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,012
I understand.

00:24:34,096 --> 00:24:36,097

way to the Upper West Side.

00:24:37,974 --> 00:24:39,017
Wait.

00:24:53,613 --> 00:24:55,615

00:25:23,765 --> 00:25:26,684
Abe! Dinner's on the table!

624
00:25:26,768 --> 00:25:28,186
Hello?

625
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,271
Rosie? Oh, my God, Rosie, is that you?

626
00:25:30,355 --> 00:25:31,689
Yes, it's me, Shirley.

627
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:33,440
Rosie, I'm beside myself.

628
00:25:33,524 --> 00:25:35,609
I feel like a building
just fell on my head.

629
00:25:35,693 --> 00:25:37,235
A block. A whole block.

630
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,571
I feel like 34th between
Sixth and Seventh

631
00:25:39,655 --> 00:25:41,823
just fell right on my head.

632
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,157
I thought dinner was on the table.

633
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:44,825
Calm down. You sound winded.

634
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:46,660
I see carrots, potatoes…

635
00:25:46,744 --> 00:25:48,662
Oh, hey, the salad's on the table.

636
00:25:48,746 --> 00:25:50,247
-I'm talking to Shirley.
-Shirley?

637
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:51,749
-Mm.
-Oh, great. Tell her to hang on.

638
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,166
I want to put her on speakerphone.

639
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,959
Shirley, will you hold
on just one minute?

640
00:25:55,043 --> 00:25:56,461
You're not hanging up on me, are you?

641
00:25:56,545 --> 00:25:57,962
No, I'll be right back.

642
00:25:58,046 --> 00:26:00,548
People think I'm such a
strong person, but I'm not.

643
00:26:00,632 --> 00:26:02,633
Hurry, before she hangs
herself with the phone cord.

644
00:26:02,717 --> 00:26:05,552
Okay. And… go.

645
00:26:05,636 --> 00:26:07,554
Shirley, are you still there?

646
00:26:07,638 --> 00:26:09,306
-Barely.
-Okay, good.

647
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,682
Go ahead. You were saying?

648
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:13,559
I was saying my heart is broken.

649
00:26:13,643 --> 00:26:14,450
[QUIETLY] Excellent.

650
00:26:14,534 --> 00:26:15,978
-What?
-Nothing. Go ahead, Shirley.

651
00:26:16,062 --> 00:26:17,980
I didn't get to have
my Yom Kippur dinner.

652
00:26:18,064 --> 00:26:19,732
It was ripped out from under me.

653
00:26:19,816 --> 00:26:22,651
Just like when we went to
Boca and we saw this magician

654
00:26:22,735 --> 00:26:24,069
and he ripped a tablecloth out

655
00:26:24,153 --> 00:26:26,405
from under a completely set table.

656
00:26:26,489 --> 00:26:28,740
Only in my case,
everything falls to the floor

657
00:26:28,824 --> 00:26:31,243
and smashes into a million pieces.

658
00:26:31,327 --> 00:26:32,243
Tell her to speak up a little.

659
00:26:32,327 --> 00:26:33,661
Shirley, dear, could you speak up?

660
00:26:33,745 --> 00:26:36,247
I look forward to that dinner all year!

661
00:26:36,331 --> 00:26:39,250
But then I heard you
all had such a terrible flu.

662
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:41,502
My heart stopped.
I mean, the flu is very serious.

663
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:43,920
People die from the flu.
But when Moishe told me

664
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:46,423
you didn't actually have
the flu, I was so relieved.

665
00:26:46,507 --> 00:26:48,508
"Thank God, I don't
have to worry about that."

666
00:26:48,592 --> 00:26:50,427
But then he said the kids split up,

667
00:26:50,511 --> 00:26:53,679
and suddenly I just wished
everybody had the flu.

668
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:55,180
-Split up?
-Now what do I have?

669
00:26:55,264 --> 00:26:56,682
No Yom Kippur.

670
00:26:56,766 --> 00:26:57,683
No daughter-in-law.

671
00:26:57,767 --> 00:26:59,518
No grandchildren.

672
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,145
You'll always have the grandchildren.

673
00:27:01,229 --> 00:27:03,020
Oh, well, sure, yes, as a concept, but…

674
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:06,357
Shirley, when did you hear
the kids were breaking up?

675
00:27:06,441 --> 00:27:07,984
-Just now.
-You're sure?

676
00:27:08,068 --> 00:27:10,820
Yes. Joel came to see
Moishe this afternoon and…

677
00:27:10,904 --> 00:27:13,363
Wait, who is this? Who am I talking to?

678
00:27:13,447 --> 00:27:15,365
That was Abe, Shirley.
Now, try and calm down.

679
00:27:15,449 --> 00:27:17,117
I promise you'll see
the grandchildren again.

680
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:19,911
When? When am I gonna see them again?

681
00:27:19,995 --> 00:27:22,079
Next Yom Kippur? What am I, 20?

682
00:27:22,163 --> 00:27:23,747
I could be dead in an hour!

683
00:27:23,831 --> 00:27:26,333
I hear there's a
terrible flu going around.

684
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:29,128
No, the flu wasn't real, Shirley.
The flu was an excuse.

685
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:32,046
Now people need an
excuse not to see family?

686
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,715
What a world.

687
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,717
She didn't go to him.
I told Miriam to go to him

688
00:27:35,801 --> 00:27:37,552
-and she didn't go to him.
-Abe, Abe…
