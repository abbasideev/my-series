00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:23,175
She says I should live
a little before it's all over.

177
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,426
Before what's all over?

178
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,511
My life. She said it's a failure.

179
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:30,474
I don't participate; that's why
my husband won't talk to me.

180
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:33,143
She's been very outspoken
since she went to Radcliffe.

181
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,436
-[SUSIE SIGHS]
-There.

182
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,521
What do you think?

183
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,106
I don't know.

184
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,192
Excuse me, is that Mermaid Ice?

185
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:42,569
I'm sorry, I'm in a big hurry.
My man's coming over

186
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,154
and I am all out of my
Mermaid Ice eye shadow.

187
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,530
And if I am not wearing
that when he gets home,

188
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:46,531
all hell breaks loose.

189
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,700
-Really?
-You kidding?

190
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,202
I couldn't get him to
give me the time of day,

191
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:52,246
much less give me the,
you know, time of day.

192
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,497
And then I came in here

193
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:54,832
-you remember when I came in here?
-I do.

194
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,292
You came in here and we talked about…

195
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:58,795
I told you my life was crap,
you sold me the Mermaid Ice,

196
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,381
and now my life is a fat, fuzzy peach.

197
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:03,883
I mean, I… I'm going broke
'cause this stuff costs a fortune,

198
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:05,218
but, man, is it worth it.

199
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:06,636
-Well, my goodness.
-Yeah.

200
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,139
If it worked for you… I'll take two.

201
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:11,307
Wonderful.

202
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:12,809
You will not be sorry.

203
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:14,435
Margo, would you mind
ringing up Mrs. Winters

204
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,771
while I help my return
customer over here?

205
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:19,816
MARGO: Hello, I can help you right here.

206
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,317
Well, well, well.

207
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:22,652
Just call me the closer.

208
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:24,988
I'm a little surprised to see you.

209
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:28,408
Well, it's been a while and last time we

210
00:07:28,492 --> 00:07:29,951
words were said and…

211
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:33,914
So, you're sorry?

212
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:35,958
-Sure.
-Good.

213
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:37,334
It's behind us.

214
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:39,003
So, this is where you hang out now?

215
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:40,254
Well, you know I never like to be

216
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:41,797
more than three feet from a lipstick.

217
00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:42,381
I do.

218
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:44,049
It's a good job.
The girls are really nice.

219
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:45,801
And there's a vending machine
in the employee break room

220
00:07:45,885 --> 00:07:48,012
that's broken, so if you hit it
just right, free Abba-Zabas.

221
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:50,389
-Mm, you are living the dream.
-Sorry to interrupt.

222
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:52,266
Midge, my parents are
making me throw them

223
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,184
a 25th anniversary party Friday.

224
00:07:54,268 --> 00:07:55,978
-Friday? Short notice.
-I know.

225
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:58,439
And I have no idea what
people of their age do at parties.

226
00:07:58,523 --> 00:08:00,190
My mom keeps saying the word canapÃ©s.

227
00:08:00,274 --> 00:08:01,233
Is that an old people's dance?

228
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:03,235
It's a type of hors d'oeuvre.

229
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,321
You always know everything,
so any tips would help.

230
00:08:05,405 --> 00:08:06,572
Hire help.

231
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:07,990
-And get chairs, lots of chairs.
-Right.

232
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:09,241
Old people sit.

233
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:10,367
MIDGE: And invite some of your friends

234
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:11,618
for a little moral support.

235
00:08:11,702 --> 00:08:13,788
Who the hell would want to
come to something like this?

236
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:15,123
I'll come.

237
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:16,374
You will?

238
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,459
Oh, my God, I love you.

239
00:08:17,543 --> 00:08:19,336
I love her.

240
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,962
Ha.

241
00:08:21,046 --> 00:08:23,131
-Booked a gig.
-I'm sorry, what?

242
00:08:23,215 --> 00:08:24,507
It's just this thing that
I've been doing lately.

243
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,009
I've been working the party circuit.

244
00:08:26,093 --> 00:08:27,135
Which means…

245
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:29,095
I go to parties and I talk.

246
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:31,556
-As opposed to…
-People like to hear me talk.

247
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,600
And so far, it's been
young parties, Viv's age.

248
00:08:33,684 --> 00:08:35,268
I haven't really worked
an older crowd yet,

249
00:08:35,352 --> 00:08:36,686
so this is a perfect opportunity.

250
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,688
I'll… I'll have to adjust a
few of my references,

251
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:40,690
but you have to be able
to read an audience, right?

252
00:08:40,774 --> 00:08:42,108
Uh-huh.

253
00:08:42,192 --> 00:08:43,860
Uh, hey, are there large
quantities of narcotics

254
00:08:43,944 --> 00:08:45,070
in these Abba-Zabas of yours?

255
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:46,363
I can't explain. I…

256
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:47,864
Just… Just come and you'll see. Friday.

257
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:51,284
-Oh, I can't. I have plans.
-What plans?

258
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:54,121
Uh, to not be bored or
miserable at some old fuck's party.

259
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:56,707
Come. You'll… You'll watch,
you'll see, you'll understand.

260
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,958
I'll… I'll call you with the address.

261
00:08:58,042 --> 00:08:59,294
Wear something… clean.

262
00:09:06,134 --> 00:09:07,802
ABE: All right, everybody.

263
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:09,261
Time's up.

264
00:09:09,345 --> 00:09:11,097
Put your papers on my desk

265
00:09:11,181 --> 00:09:13,474
if they contain the correct answers,

266
00:09:13,558 --> 00:09:16,227
otherwise, just don't.

267
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:18,729
-Abe.
-Oh, hello, Irving.

268
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:20,064
What's up?

269
00:09:20,148 --> 00:09:21,565
I want you to meet Charles Connelly,

270
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:24,193
Executive Recruiter from Bell Labs.

271
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:25,611
Bell Labs.

272
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:26,987
You got time to talk?

273
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:28,864
Uh, sure.

274
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:30,699
We're calling it Project Echo, Abe.

275
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:33,495
A quantum leap in satellite technology.

276
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:35,163
The commercial ramifications
of this could be huge.

277
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:36,998
Not to mention its defense capabilities.

278
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:39,459
IRVING: It would revolutionize
the communications industry.

279
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:41,128
CHARLES: And Bell
Labs is leading the pack.

280
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:42,462
Abe, we're gathering
the best and the brightest

281
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:43,922
to help us get there first.

282
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:46,299
-May I stop you there?
-CHARLES: Of course.

283
00:09:46,383 --> 00:09:49,386
I want no part of Sputnik panic.

284
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,595
This smacks of that.

285
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,180
There's no panic, Abe.

286
00:09:52,264 --> 00:09:53,265
We're doing this right.

287
00:09:53,349 --> 00:09:54,474
We never rush R&D.

288
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:55,559
Your colleague, Bill Chernik…

289
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:56,935
Bill and Abe have known
each other a long time.

290
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:59,020
Bill Chernik's a good man.

291
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:00,605
CHARLES: He's been
consulting with us for a while.

292
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:02,399
Ask him about us.
You'll like what you hear.

293
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:04,109
There's no way this could work.

294
00:10:04,193 --> 00:10:06,027
My class load is so full.

295
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:08,071
We can help with that.
Take things off your plate.

296
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:10,490
No, I'm loath to do that.

297
00:10:10,574 --> 00:10:12,076
CHARLES: We'll work around your schedule.

298
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,870
An applied mathematician of your skills

299
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:15,496
is in high demand these days.

300
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,373
-We need you.
-[CHUCKLES]

301
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:19,167
I told you he'd be a tough sell.

302
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,751
Which makes us want you more.

303
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:22,044
Pending a security clearance,

304
00:10:22,128 --> 00:10:23,463
Bell Labs is at your beck and call.

305
00:10:23,547 --> 00:10:24,505
I need to get home.

306
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:26,132
Let me walk with you.

307
00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:27,758
-[BELL TOLLS]
-Please think it over.

308
00:10:27,842 --> 00:10:29,802
Take some time.
And call with any questions.

309
00:10:29,886 --> 00:10:31,596
-I doubt I'll have any.
-Call anyhow.

310
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,264
I'll give you the pitch all over again.

311
00:10:33,348 --> 00:10:35,349
And thanks for your time.

312
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:37,102
See you Monday, Abe.

313
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:42,398
We're going out to dinner!

314
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:43,566
ROSE: Abe?

315
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,068
Rose, Rose, get in here.

316
00:10:46,152 --> 00:10:48,070
We are going out to dinner.

317
00:10:48,154 --> 00:10:51,158
Ruby Foo's, Le Pavillon, name it.

318
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:53,202
Abe, slow down.
Why are we going out to dinner?

319
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,870
Bell Labs, Rose.

320
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,997
I got an offer to work at Bell Labs.

321
00:10:57,081 --> 00:10:59,082
-What?
-Bell Labs down in the village!

322
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,542
Oh, my God, Abe!

323
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,670
-[LAUGHING]
-Oh, oh.

324
00:11:03,754 --> 00:11:06,840
You should have seen
me with that recruiter.

325
00:11:06,924 --> 00:11:08,926
I played it so cool.

326
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,969
I kind of nodded like this,

327
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:12,429
was shaking my head a little bit.

328
00:11:12,513 --> 00:11:14,056
Very serious, very dubious.

329
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,725
Oh, you can look
extremely dubious. [LAUGHS]

330
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,061
And he was eating out
of the palm of my hand.

331
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,271
This is the big leagues, Rose.

332
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:24,816
This… this is the hotbed of invention.

333
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,736
That TV that you all like so much,

334
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,407
-courtesy of Bell Labs transistor work.
-No.

335
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:33,618
-ETHAN: Grandpa, I was watching that.
-Oh.

336
00:11:33,702 --> 00:11:38,122
Bardeen and Brattain and
Shockley won a Nobel for that.

337
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:40,208
And now I am in their ranks.

338
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:41,918
Where are we going for dinner?

339
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,336
What about a dinner?

340
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,754
We're going out. The whole family.

341
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,047
Call Noah and Astrid.

342
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:48,883
He's got an offer from Bell Labs.

343
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:51,261
-Wow, Papa, congratulations.
-[LAUGHS]

344
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:52,845
Thank you very much.

345
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,347
You've been obsessing on Bell Labs

346
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:55,974
-for, like, 20 years now.
-Mm-hmm.

347
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:57,392
I haven't been obsessing on them.

348
00:11:57,476 --> 00:11:59,269
My whole childhood, it was
Bell Labs this and Bell Labs that,

-Yes.

Okay, I… I'm talking about
very important things here,

I have to get dressed.
Congratulations, Papa.

How often do I get a job at Bell Labs

and no one wants to celebrate with me?

Oh, Abe, my love, we will find
the perfect night to celebrate.

Ever since she kicked
Junie Paul in the shins,

1211
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:11,896
-I run when I see her.
-She starts telling me this story

1212
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,481
-about her mother's health.
-Mm.

1213
00:43:13,565 --> 00:43:15,858
And right as she says
she's only got a month to live,

the baby starts laughing.

But then, Mrs. Klaviter laughed, too.

I would think.

1224

keep her hair long enough

-They were enormous,

1226
