1
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:04,636
The Stanford branch is closing,

2
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:08,307
and everybody's just
packing up their stuff.

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:11,410
Andy Bernard
made these tasteful hats.

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,813
...that's the other thing
you gotta watch out... Yo!

5
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:18,117
Tuna, I wanna talk to you about
this new boss, Michael Scott.

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,518
Yeah?

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,953
So, what's he like?

8
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,955
Likes, dislikes,
favorite sports,

9
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:26,258
favorite movies,
favorite... men's magazines.

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,394
You know what, I think you
just need to meet him.

11
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:31,163
Playing your cards
close to the vest, I get it.

12
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,399
Good luck over there, Tuna.

13
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:36,035
Cross me,
and I will destroy you.

14
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,570
Sounds good, Andy.

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,106
This is gonna be an adventure.

16
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:44,043
Yes, this is going to be
very interesting.

17
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:45,244
All right.

18
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:46,178
I'm outta here.

19
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,379
See you later?

20
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,914
Right on.

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,154
Hey, is that Josh's comput...

22
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:56,188
What?

23
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,195
Hey.
- Hey.

24
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:04,196
How'd the run go?

25
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,864
Ah, pretty good.
I finished.

26
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,132
That's great.
- Thanks.

27
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,967
Why is that great?

28
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,869
Because he
accomplished something.

29
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,171
What was your mile time?

30
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:13,705
About seven.

31
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:16,341
I could beat that
on a skateboard.

32
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,476
Well, that has wheels.

33
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:18,644
Yeah, well, my feet don't,

34
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:20,379
and I could still
crush that time.

35
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,281
Really, Dwight?
How fast are you?

36
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:23,782
Let's just put it this way...

37
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,785
Last weekend, I outran
a black pepper snake.

38
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:27,686
Really?

39
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:28,687
I am fast.

40
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,222
To give you a reference point,

41
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:33,192
I'm somewhere between a snake
and a mongoose.

42
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:34,893
And a panther.

43
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,229
Man, what is
taking Toby so long?

44
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,864
Oh, I'll just time him later.

45
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,399
And you'll compare the times?

46
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:42,167
Yeah.

47
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,335
Are you ready?

48
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,237
Set, go!
- No. My groin's really tight.

49
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,271
I can't...

50
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,678
Am I being mean to Dwight?

51
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,279
I don't know.

52
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,681
I did just make him
run around the building,

53
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:58,150
and I have no intention
of timing him.

54
00:01:58,152 --> 00:01:59,485
This isn't even a stopwatch.

55
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:02,654
It's a digital thermometer.

56
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,656
He does make my life
harder sometimes.

57
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,091
And on purpose.

58
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,093
Like he tried to put meters
on the bathroom stalls

59
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:11,029
as a way of bringing in
more money for the company.

60
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:14,399
Hey!
Three more laps to go!

61
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,268
You gotta pick it up
if you're gonna beat Toby!

62
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:21,173
Well, I should probably
get back to work.

63
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,776
He-e-ere...

64
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,044
Who's here?

65
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,345
Nametag?
- Yes, please.

66
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,547
Karen Filippelli.

67
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:02,581
Karen Filip...

68
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,516
Karen a-Filippelli.

69
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,751
Probably Italian.

70
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:07,252
Possibly Filipina.

71
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,420
Okay.

72
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,622
My branch is absorbing
the Stamford branch.

73
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:15,093
Or, as I like to put it,
my family is doubling in size.

74
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,828
And that's all
I'm gonna say about it

75
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,566
because I have a gigantic
performance ahead of me

76
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:24,102
and I have to get
into my head and focus.

77
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,873
And who's next?
- That is Andy Bernard.

78
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,541
Andy Bernard.

79
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,543
If I were you...
- St. Bernard.

80
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,879
I would fire Anthony Gardner...

81
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,180
- What?
- before noon...

82
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,481
- I'm not...
- to consolidate power.

83
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,950
I'm not firing somebody
on the first day.

84
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:40,052
No, no, no, not somebody.
Gardner.

85
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:42,354
The Japanese camp guards
of World War II

86
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:44,256
always chose one man to kill

87
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:46,558
whenever a batch
of new prisoners arrived.

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,064
I always wondered how they
chose the man who was to die.

89
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:56,101
I think I would have been good
at choosing the person.

90
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,569
Good morning.

91
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,571
You got the food.
Good!

92
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,606
Lookee, lookee, lookee.

93
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:01,673
What I want you to do...

94
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,508
Set it up
in the conference room, please.

95
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,710
Make it look nice,

96
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:06,411
as if you were trying to
impress a much older man

97
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,180
who's way out of your league.
- Okay.

98
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,517
Yes, I'm in a good mood today.

99
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,421
I'm excited to meet
all of the new people

100
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,925
and to see my old friend again,
definitely.

101
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,627
That's always a thing
that makes people happy,

102
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,195
to have an old friend back.

103
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:24,497
Hello?

104
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:27,432
Ah! Ding ding ding ding ding!
Our first arrival.

105
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,867
Welcome to Scranton.

106
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:32,037
This is
Hannah Smoteridge-Barr.

107
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,106
Hannah Smoteridge-Barr.

108
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,408
Welcome to our humble abode.

109
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,909
Follow me to your desk.

110
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,413
Your ball and chain
is right over here.

111
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,116
You know, a lot of these people,

112
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,751
this is the only family they
have.

113
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,052
So...

114
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,420
As far as I'm concerned,

115
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:52,057
this says,
"World's Best Dad."

116
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:55,394
Ah... there he is.
Tony...

117
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:56,495
- What's your last name?
- Gardner.

118
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:57,729
Gardner.

119
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,364
I knew that.
There you go.

120
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,399
Gift bag...

121
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,801
For you, okay?
- Thanks.

122
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,803
Michael, I didn't get
a gift bag.

123
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,171
Well, they're just for guests.

124
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,639
If there are any left over,
you can buy one later.

125
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,074
My bag's mostly pencils.

126
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,109
Wwoo-aa-and coupons...

127
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,045
...to various hot spots
around Scranton.

128
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:16,748
All right, let me show you
to your area, sir.

129
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,883
Come on, big guy.

130
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:20,419
Can I have your pencils?
- No.

131
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:21,853
Hi.
- Hi.

132
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:24,222
I'm Pam.
- Karen. I love your sweater.

133
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,925
Oh, thanks.
My mom made it for me.

134
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,527
Really?
That's so cool.

135
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,262
I've always wanted to
learn how to knit.

136
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:31,963
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

137
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:35,200
Take me to your leader.

138
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:38,036
Oh, wait.
I am your leader.

139
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,740
Uh, wait, are you a robot

140
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,241
or a Martian?

141
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,377
Hmm? Ah...

142
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,479
I'm actually your boss,
Michael Scott.

143
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,647
Hi. Karen.
- Welcome.

144
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,349
Wow, you are
very exotic-looking.

145
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,184
Was your dad a G.I.,
or...?

146
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,564
I'll be the number two guy
here in Scranton in six weeks.

147
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:06,631
How?

148
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,467
Name repetition,
personality mirroring,

149
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:11,036
and never
breaking off a handshake.

150
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,605
I'm always thinking
one step ahead,

151
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,140
like a...

152
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,608
carpenter...

153
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,477
that makes stairs.

154
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,613
Hello.

155
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,915
Ah!
You must be Andy Bernard.

156
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,618
Aloha and welcome.

157
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,253
And you must be Michael Scott.

158
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:31,323
Aloha and hello.

159
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,091
Very good.

160
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:37,295
Welcome to our little kingdom.

161
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:41,166
Uh, we have a bag
of nifty gifties for you.

162
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:43,435
Well, Michael, thank you
for welcoming me

163
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,404
to your little kingdom, Mike.

164
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,305
Oh.

165
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:48,306
Nifty!

166
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,075
They are nifty.

167
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,676
They're nifty gifties.

168
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,145
You know who I really like

169
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:54,613
is this guy Andy Bernard.

170
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:58,617
He has got this
very likable way about him.

171
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,521
Which is why they need a passing game.
- Right.

172
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,756
No way.
Get him outta here.

173
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,558
We don't want any
of this kind in here.

174
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,893
Good to see you, man.
- Wow. Okay.

175
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,195
How are you?
Martin Nash, I presume?

176
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:12,697
This is a little gift bag
for you, free of charge.

177
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,899
Follow me.

178
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,734
I will show you
where all the slaves work.

179
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:16,802
Not...

180
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:19,504
So your desk is...

181
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:20,939
Hi. I'm Jim.
I'm new here.

182
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,174
Oh, my God!
It's really you.

183
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,976
I was just doin'
a little joke there

184
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,011
about how we'd never met.

185
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,279
I know.
I don't care.

186
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,580
Awesome.

187
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,615
Good to be back.

188
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,850
The place looks really good.

189
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:33,051
It's really good to see you.

190
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,553
You, too.

191
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:37,255
Where do I stand with Pam?

192
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,891
Um... no idea.

193
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,893
I mean, we're friends.

194
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:44,229
Always have been friends, um...

195
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,565
That is where we stand.

196
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,166
Well, well, well.

197
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,969
Look what the cat
dragged in from Stamford.

198
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,003
Hey, Dwight.

199
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:55,874
Fact: I am older.
I am wiser.

200
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,042
Do not mess with me.

201
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,644
Okay.
Sounds good.

202
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,546
What are you doing?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

203
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:02,781
Do I have a spider
on my forehead?

204
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,149
No. Look good.

205
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,117
Why are you looking
at my forehead?

206
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,719
I'm not.

207
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,754
Meet my eye line, Jim.

208
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:10,956
I am.

209
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,491
Stop acting like an idiot!

210
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,426
Okay.

211
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:15,494
Hey, buddy.

212
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,995
Welcome back.

213
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,129
Hey, how are you, man?
Good to see you.

214
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,264
I'm good.
How are you?

215
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,469
So...

216
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,570
Oh, I'm sorry.

217
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:26,571
Are you sitting here now?

218
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,507
Yeah.

219
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,641
Oh.

220
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,711
Um...

221
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,514
unless you really, really
want it back.

222
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:38,383
You know, man,
it's really your call.

223
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,951
Cool. Thank you.

224
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,354
Mm-hmm.

225
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,389
Let me get that for you.

226
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,192
You got it?

227
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,093
Mm-hmm.

228
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,598
This one taken?
No? Good.

229
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,603
Yeah, Jim is a nice guy.

230
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:02,374
That's why I got the desk.

231
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,175
Hey, this came
with the Stanford people.

232
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,211
Can you take care of it?

233
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,080
Oh, yes I can.

234
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:12,884
In general, they do not give me
much responsibility.

235
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,454
But, they do let me shred
the company documents,

236
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,157
and that is really all I need.

237
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,765
Michael Scott, thank you.

238
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,000
I appreciate it, Mike.

239
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,302
All right.

240
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:31,570
Hello.

241
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,672
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

242
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:36,041
Dwight Schrute...
assistant regional manager.

243
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:38,577
Andy Bernard, regional director
in charge of sales.

244
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,778
So you'll be
reporting to me then.

245
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,979
Mmm... on the contrary.

246
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,347
My title has "manager" in it.

247
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,382
And I'm a director,

248
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:47,385
which on a film set
is the highest title there is.

249
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,287
Do you know anything about film?

250
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,222
I know everything about film.

251
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:54,292
I've seen over 240 of them.

252
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,694
Congratulations.

253
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,402
He-ey, Toby.

254
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:05,604
- Hey, Jim.
- How are you, man?

255
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,405
- Really good, how're you?
- I just wanted to say hi.

256
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:08,506
Hey, welcome back.

257
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,810
Oh, is-is that like
your new thing, or...

258
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,912
No, I'm sorry, thats...

259
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,480
- No, it's cool.
- No, it's not.

260
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:16,848
Well, let's just...

261
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,786
- All right, good to be back.
- So... okay.

262
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,887
All right.

263
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,422
All right, sor-
sorry about that.

264
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,323
- It was...
- No problem.

265
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,791
What?

266
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,959
Nothing.

267
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,567
This thing is so awesome.

268
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,068
It will shred anything.

269
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,672
Ooh... it'll shred a CD.

270
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,708
It will shred...

271
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,479
...a credit card.

272
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,748
It will shred...

273
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,049
Oh...

274
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:53,918
Shoot.

275
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,388
"I present
the orientation video."

276
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,422
We need to talk.

277
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:58,423
Not now.

278
00:10:58,425 --> 00:10:59,424
Which is higher,

279
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:00,659
assistant regional manager

280
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,527
or regional director
in charge of sales?

281
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,095
I told you,
the titles are irrelevant.

282
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,697
They just relate to pay scale.

283
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,365
Okay, so who gets
paid more, me or Andy?

284
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,100
It is not a matter
of more or less.

285
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,669
Your pay is just different,

286
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:11,970
okay?

287
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:14,305
All right.
Show time, part one.

288
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:15,507
Okay, who reports to who?

289
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,542
I don't care, Dwight.

290
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:18,710
You all report to me.

291
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:20,078
That's all that matters.

292
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,313
The rest of it just work out
amongst yourselves, okay?

293
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,149
- And then if I want...
- Work it out amongst yourselves!

294
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,184
- I...
- Please! I have a company to run.

295
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,285
Will you let me run the company?

296
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,286
- I...
- Will you?

297
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,655
- One...
- Please?

298
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,994
- Ji-i-im!
- Kelly!

299
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:38,363
Oh, my God,
I have so much to tell you!

300
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,798
- Really?
- Yes!

301
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,901
Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, they
had a baby, and they named it Suri.

302
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,736
And then Brad Pitt
and Angelina Jolie,

303
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,038
they had a baby, too,
and they named it Shiloh.

304
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,241
- And both babies are...
- amaa-azing!

305
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,676
Great.

306
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:53,011
What's new with you?

307
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,181
I just told you.

308
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,650
Okay, everybody settled in?

309
00:11:58,652 --> 00:11:59,718
Good.

310
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,052
Why don't we all proceed

311
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,921
into the conference room?

312
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:06,891
Or, should I say,
the banquet hall?

313
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,027
For...
drumroll, please...

314
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:17,736
The official Merger Day
All-Family Welcome Breakfast.

315
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:18,870
Come on in.

316
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,138
Don't be shy.

317
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,074
Hey, champagne.

318
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,510
No, no.
Guests only.

319
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,580
- Smoked salmon.
- No... um...

320
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:29,380
For the guests, it is.

321
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,349
For you, consider it cow meat.

322
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:32,383
Strictly taboo.

323
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:32,383
I eat beef.

324
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:35,720
Well, then, consider it
poisoned beef.

325
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:35,720
It's-no touchy.

326
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:39,524
- The beef is poisoned?
- No, it's not-be-just-

327
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:40,759
Sit down, please.

328
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,527
Welcome, help yourself.

329
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,530
You might want
these orientation materials.

330
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,999
Wrong, Toby, this is
an orientation,

331
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,334
not a "bore-ientation."

332
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:54,405
Okay, do not worry,
all of your questions

333
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,074
are about to be answered.

334
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,742
Cell phones and pagers
off, please.

335
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,110
Oh, this looks promising.

336
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,411
You won't be disappointed.

337
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,814
Let's face it,
moving to a new job

338
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,115
can be very stressful.

339
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,818
So, I have made
an orientation video

340
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,287
especially for you newcomers.

341
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,258
But it's not like
any orientation video

342
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,393
that any of you have ever seen.

343
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,896
It's funny.

344
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:20,698
It's got a little bit
of a zing to it.

345
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,534
And I hope that it gives you

346
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:24,969
a flavor of what we're all about

347
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,138
here at Dunder-Mifflin,

348
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,274
and what we're all about
here in Scranton.

349
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:33,211
So let's just all
laugh together and watch...

350
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,880
Lazy Scranton.

351
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,803
It reminds me
of the orientation video

352
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,672
Michael showed on my first day:

353
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,374
The Scranton Witch Project.

354
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,210
I am so scared

355
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:08,646
when people don't label
their personal food.

356
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:25,263
Well, so far,
I think it is killing.

357
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:28,166
I thought it would
either be an A or an A-plus.

358
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:32,237
But I completely forgot
that there is an A-plus-plus.

359
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,041
This is Karen Filippelli,
please leave a message.

360
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,409
Terrible.

361
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,245
Totally unconvincing.

362
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,350
This is Karen Filippelli,
please leave a message.

363
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,085
Not bad, but...

364
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,153
...you are Italian, so...

365
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,122
Try it more Italian.

366
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,326
This is Karen-a Filippelli,

367
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,828
please leave-a me
da message.

368
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,663
Abbondanza.

369
00:14:58,665 --> 00:14:59,631
- You feel good?
- Mm-hmm.

370
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:00,798
All right.

371
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,105
Karen Filippelli

372
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,010
Hey buddy.

373
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:14,078
Anything new to report?

374
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,981
Do you mean to me, from you?

375
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,285
'Cause that's how it works.

376
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,489
Sure thing, buddy.

377
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,461
Am I trying
to get under his skin?

378
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:35,800
Y-y-yes, because the angrier he gets,
the more marginalized he becomes.

379
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,703
Meanwhile, Andy Bernard
is out there...

380
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:41,372
...layin' on the charm.

381
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:45,710
Hey, Angela, check this out.

382
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,713
It's my new screensaver.

383
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:49,714
Oh.

384
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:50,782
Do you like it?

385
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,517
I do like it, actually.

386
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,118
Thank you.

387
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:56,988
You have...

388
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,824
such a pretty smile, by the way.

389
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,893
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

390
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,229
Hey.

391
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,331
Hey.

392
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,598
What happened to grape soda?

393
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,733
Oh, yeah.

394
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,835
I'm trying to move away
from that.

395
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,937
I'm getting into more
of a bottled water phase.

396
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,039
Oh, you've changed so much.

397
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,775
Well, I'm evolving, Pam.

398
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,477
So when do I
get to hear everything?

399
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,112
Are you still getting unpacked?

400
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,681
Or you want to grab a coffee
or something after work?

401
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:24,716
Oh, um...

402
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:26,250
Tonight, actually?
No.

403
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:27,452
I'm just still getting settled.

404
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,087
Oh, yeah, no.
You know, whenever.

405
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:32,423
- Okay
- O-o-kay.

406
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,392
- Sorry to interrupt, I...
- Nope.

407
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:37,328
You're not
interrupting anything.

408
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,931
- No, I'm-Don't...
- All right.

409
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,933
- Okay.
- All right.

410
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,803
I should probably
get back to work.

411
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,338
I have to work.

412
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,240
- Yeah, I know. Me too.
- All right.

413
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,146
The day's going fine.

414
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:58,282
It's been a little chaotic,
but it's fine.

415
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,318
It's great.

416
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,553
A lot of distractions,
but it's good.

417
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,661
Take a picture.
It'll last longer.

418
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:13,865
I'm sorry, it's just...
It's a little distracting.

419
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,967
Ditto that, my brother.

420
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,953
Look what's on his computer.

421
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,289
What is that,
a squid's eye, or...

422
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,793
It's my left breast.

423
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:45,163
- How did... you...
- Right place at the right time.

424
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,700
Oh.
What's that smell?

425
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:50,835
What smell?

426
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,670
It's...

427
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:56,474
Must be air freshener
plugged in somewhere.

428
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,309
It smells like a funeral home.

429
00:17:58,311 --> 00:17:59,811
Oh, I'll help you find it.

430
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,450
Oh, you know what?
Never... never mind.

431
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:06,684
What is it?

432
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:07,718
I... I think

433
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
I'm just allergic
to your perfume.

434
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,556
My perfume?

435
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,524
It's just my crazy nose.

436
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:14,559
I'm, um...

437
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,928
used to different smells.

438
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,030
Bob Vance bought
this perfume for me

439
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:20,798
in metropolitan Orlando.

440
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,700
It's made from real pine.

441
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,435
Who's Bob Vance?

442
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,505
You have a lot to learn
about this town, sweetie.

443
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,810
I don't know who
these new people think they are.

444
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:36,814
I've sat downwind of Phyllis'
stinky perfumes for years.

445
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,616
Never said a word.

446
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,451
People hate people
that are different from them.

447
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,853
That's natural.

448
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,355
But you know what makes people
forget their differences?

449
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:44,355
A great show.

450
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:48,426
That is why I created
the integration celebration.

451
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:49,894
This is the moment

452
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:53,097
when Scranton and Stamford
come together as one,

453
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,900
united in applause.

454
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,737
I know what a lot of you
must be thinking.

455
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,539
"Wow, what a day.

456
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,207
"It feels more like
a night at a party

457
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,342
than a day at work."

458
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:07,178
Well, in my opinion,

459
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,082
business should feel
like a night out,

460
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,117
a night...

461
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,619
at...

462
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,890
the Roxbury.

463
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,627
Okay, there's
supposed to be music.

464
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,061
And it's... I got it!
I got it!

465
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:25,630
Dwight, just...

466
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,398
Do you have batteries in that?
- Stupid.

467
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,799
Um...

468
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,540
That's it.

469
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,076
Okay, here we go.

470
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:46,384
Here we go.
Here we go. Uhh!

471
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,634
Oh, my nose is so itchy.
Why is my nose so itchy?

472
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,970
Uh, probably because
of all the nose candy.

473
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:10,575
I told you these guys
have a sense of humor.

474
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,210
Very funny, Michael.

475
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,644
Okay, okay. All right.
- Really funny, Michael.

476
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:14,979
All right, all right,
I'm on a roll.

477
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:18,282
Why are the new people
on the table?

478
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:19,817
To show them

479
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,453
that we are not above them.

480
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,355
Shouldn't we be equals?

481
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,591
Not today.
No.

482
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,328
Tony, please join your cohorts

483
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,763
on the table, if you would.

484
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,500
Uh, this is difficult for me.

485
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,736
Hey, I understand.
We're all friends.

486
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,605
No, I mean, I can't physically.

487
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,206
I can't get on the table.

488
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,075
Oh, well...

489
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:47,345
just use the momentum

490
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:51,182
of your lower half
to hoist yourself up.

491
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:52,250
Okay?

492
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,689
You know what?
I'll help.

493
00:20:58,691 --> 00:20:59,790
I will help.
- No. Please...

494
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:00,992
don't.

495
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:03,060
Don't be shy.
Dwight, let's do this.

496
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,061
Come on.
We're doin' this thing.

497
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,596
Ready? On three.
- Let's get up.

498
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,098
One, two...
- Bend at the knees.

499
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,099
- Go!
- Okay, here we go!

500
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,267
Here we go.

501
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,836
I'm under this...
I'm under this hock here.

502
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,404
I don't know what
I'm grabbin' here.

503
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:15,306
All right, all right, stop.
Put me down.

504
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,974
- Put me down.
- Push it! Push it!

505
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,075
I'm right in your crack.

506
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,577
Put me down now!
- You're almost there!

507
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:20,845
Put me down right now!

508
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,213
I've had enough!
- You've got it.

509
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:23,581
Put me down right now!

510
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:24,615
Whoa whoa whoa!
Okay.

511
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,817
Hey, hey. Easy.
- Easy.

512
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:27,918
I'm sorry.

513
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,020
Don't...

514
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:31,922
It's just not
going to work for me.

515
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,758
I have to go.

516
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,826
I don't understand.

517
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,528
I was on the fence about this,

518
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,864
and it's just not a good fit.

519
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:41,499
Well, we'll squeeze you in.

520
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,367
I can't work here.

521
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:46,837
I have to quit.

522
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,473
You can't quit on the first day.

523
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,543
That's...
heresy, my friend.

524
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,512
Okay, let's talk about this.

525
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:57,148
What happened?
I mean, what...

526
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:57,915
Was it Toby?

527
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,784
Did he say something?

528
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:01,619
'Cause he's...

529
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:04,855
No, Toby was helpful.
He was very kind.

530
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,459
It's just your management style.

531
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,229
My management style?

532
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:14,999
So...

533
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,168
Didn't you think
Lazy Scranton was funny?

534
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,669
No.

535
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,171
Was it supposed to be funny?

536
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,239
Okay, well...

537
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,344
Don't bother quitting
because you're fired.

538
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,746
Excuse me?
- You are fired!

539
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:31,649
I'm sorry, but we don't
have quitters on this team.

540
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:32,983
Just clean out your desk!

541
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:35,486
But there's nothing
in my desk except coupons.

542
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:37,221
Don't try to apologize
to me, man.

543
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:39,156
It's too late.
Just get out.

544
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,727
Take your bad vibes with you.

545
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,662
That was my advice, remember?

546
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:46,030
I'm the one who suggested
that you fire him.

547
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,432
Probably the best advice
you ever gave me, Dwight.

548
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:49,900
And what advice

549
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:53,371
has Andy given to you today
that you have acted on?

550
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,973
Would "none" be
an accurate estimate?

551
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:58,609
None advice?

552
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,077
Fire Andy.

553
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,347
Fire... Andy.

554
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:06,450
Dwight may have won the battle,

555
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:10,621
but I will win the next battle.

556
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:11,622
Tony was right.

557
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,457
This environment
is dysfunctional.

558
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:15,459
Well, maybe that's
because some people treat it

559
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,661
like their own private
Hooters strip club.

560
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:20,331
Whoa, Angela, hold on.

561
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,766
Hooters is a restaurant

562
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:24,001
with over 400 locations
worldwide.

563
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,770
Back to work.
We don't have to get along.

564
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,071
We just have to work together.

565
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,106
No, we do have to get along.

566
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:32,343
Can't we all just get along?

567
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:37,047
Or have we forgotten the words
of the Reverend King?

568
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,849
The word "merger"
comes from the word "marriage."

569
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:40,818
And that was what today
was supposed to be.

570
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,188
The loving union between people.

571
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,957
Instead, it has become like...

572
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:50,428
when my mom moved in with Jeff.

573
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,398
And, once again,
it becomes my job to fix it.

574
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,499
Hey!

575
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:56,500
Hey, everybody!

576
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:57,568
Something happened!

577
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,703
Those guys
from Vance Refrigeration,

578
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,372
they let the air
out of our tires.

579
00:24:01,374 --> 00:24:02,840
- What?!
- Yeah! They punked us!

580
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:04,508
They punked us good.
Come on.

581
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,076
Come on.

582
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,815
Does Bob Vance
work for Vance Refrigeration?

583
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:12,883
Does he ever.

584
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,524
Man, they got us so bad.

585
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:22,526
We cannot let 'em
get away with this.

586
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,262
We have got to
pull together as one

587
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,363
and steal their refrigerators.

588
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:27,798
Yeah!
- Yeah?

589
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,700
I don't think we can do that.

590
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,068
Go home, Toby.
Just...

591
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,336
Hey!

592
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:33,671
Why doesn't your car
have a flat tire?

593
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,239
Why?
I will tell you why.

594
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:38,609
Because they saved
the worst for me.

595
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:41,579
They put a hate note
under my windshield wiper.

596
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:43,180
Check this out.
It's so hateful.

597
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,648
"You guys suck!

598
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,717
"You can never
pull together as one

599
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:47,818
"and revenge us.

600
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,520
That is why
you suck."

601
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:51,322
For crying out loud.

602
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:53,190
No. No, no, no, no.

603
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:54,492
No.
You are falling for it.

604
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,060
You are playing
right into their hands.

605
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:57,394
This is just what
they want you to do.

606
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:58,762
Man, what is with this guy?

607
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:00,764
Got an hour?
I'll try to explain.

608
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,271
This is egregious!

609
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,774
This is egregious!

610
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,278
Trust me, it only gets worse.

611
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,746
Is he always like this?

612
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,348
Sometimes he brings
more costumes.

613
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,683
Hmm.
When do people work?

614
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,219
Oh, we find little times
during the day.

615
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:24,021
How're we gonna get home?

616
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:27,525
Bob Vance has an air pump. He
said he'd fill all our tires up.

617
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:29,593
Bob Vance
of Vance Refrigeration.

618
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,063
See that?

619
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,798
Mission accomplished.

620
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,867
They're like a bunch
of fourth graders.

621
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,470
Sometimes what brings
the kids together

622
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:41,572
is hating the lunch lady.

623
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:43,073
Although that'll change

624
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:46,210
because by the end
of the fourth grade,

625
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,279
the lunch lady
was actually the person

626
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:50,414
I hung out with the most.

627
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,320
Jello.

628
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:57,688
- Michael.
- Hi, Jan.

629
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,657
Did you fire Tony Gardner
when he was trying to quit?

630
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:00,691
I did.

631
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:03,193
Major personnel crisis averted.

632
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:03,193
Complement accepted.

633
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:08,933
Do you realize, Michael, that we
now have to pay him severance?

634
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:10,100
Yes.

635
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,102
You do?

636
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:15,339
But do you realize that that
was actually Dwight's idea?

637
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,074
Bad advice from my number two.

638
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,542
What...?
No. No.

639
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:20,744
No, Jim is your number two.

640
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:20,744
What?

641
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:24,014
He's the only one who has
worked with both groups.

642
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:27,384
I sent you a memo about this.

643
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:30,454
Yes, I know that,
for I do read the memos.

644
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,091
So, after a great deal
of thought

645
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,359
and introspective-shun,

646
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:38,195
I have decided to make Jim

647
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:40,230
my new number two.

648
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:42,633
If he even wants it.

649
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:43,968
It doesn't come
with a pay raise.

650
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,869
No, it does, actually.

651
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:49,006
So who will be
your new number three?

652
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:51,275
Uh, that I have not decided yet.

653
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:52,943
Michael, I would just
like to say

654
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,479
that you have handled
this entire situation

655
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,281
with great aplomb.

656
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,850
Thank you, Andy.
That's very kind.

657
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:01,986
And I have to say
that your leadership...

658
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:02,987
Shut it.

659
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:03,988
Shut it.

660
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,055
That's...

661
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,292
Suck-up.

662
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,467
Hey.
Where you at, Filippelli?

663
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:19,036
I'm at the grocery store
buying a corkscrew

664
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:20,638
to give myself a lobotomy.

665
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:23,841
What's wrong, you didn't
have a good first day?

666
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:25,476
Oh, my God.

667
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,378
Hey, you want to meet
at Cooper's in an hour?

668
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,545
I need a drink.

669
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,514
Yeah, sure.
Sounds good.

670
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:31,782
I...

671
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:32,950
Hey, you know what?

672
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:34,151
Can I give you a call
right back?

673
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,452
Yeah.
- Okay. Thanks.

674
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,287
Okay.

675
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:39,089
Hey.

676
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:40,157
Hey.

677
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,059
I thought you had already left.

678
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:43,394
Uh... no.

679
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:44,995
I just had some

680
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,630
other stuff I had to do.
- Oh, good.

681
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:47,731
What's up?

682
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:49,233
Oh, nothing.
I just feel bad.

683
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:50,467
I feel like things
were a little weird today

684
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:51,568
or something.

685
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,003
What do you mean?

686
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,773
I just think I should tell you

687
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:58,709
that I've sort of
started seeing someone,

688
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:00,411
Oh.
and, uh...

689
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:01,812
That's totally cool.

690
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:03,781
You can do whatever you want.

691
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:06,417
Oh. Okay, uh...

692
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:07,785
Good.

693
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:09,053
We're friends.

694
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:11,522
We'll always be friends.

695
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,357
Right.

696
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:15,859
It's good to have you back.

697
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,294
Yeah.

698
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:19,563
Good to be back.

699
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,516
Where'd you get that salad?

700
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:41,251
Staples.

701
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,524
I saw your dork-mobile
in the parking lot.

702
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:49,026
What does it get,
like four miles to the gallon?

703
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:50,661
Uh, try double that.

704
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:52,930
Classic Trans Am,
vintage American muscle.

705
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:55,532
- Please. - 'Kay, my
Xterra's pretty sweet.

706
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,367
Luxurious, yet rugged.

707
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:58,368
Leave it to the Japanese.

708
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,170
"Xterra" is not even
a real word.

709
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:01,572
Actually, it is.

710
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:03,073
It's Latin for "Earth."

711
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,675
Oh, so you drive
an "X-Earth?"

712
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:06,176
- Yeah.
- That makes sense.

713
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:08,579
I'd rather drive
a classic Trans Am

714
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,180
than an "X-Earth."

715
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,282
Yeah, I bet you would.

716
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,218
Oh, uh, by the way, 1985 called.

717
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,452
It wants its car back.

718
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:17,254
Well, I hope 1985
has a time machine,

719
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,388
'cause I drive an '87.

720
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,057
Oh, speaking of time machines,

721
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,225
I just got back from the future,

722
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:23,093
and I went to your funeral,
and... guess what?

723
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,394
Nobody came.

724
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:26,130
Speaking of funerals...

725
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:29,199
Why don't you go ahead
and go die?

726
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:31,602
Oh, that was a really...

727
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,437
...well constructed sentence.

728
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,472
You should be
an English professor

729
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:38,308
at Cor-not University

730
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,810
Idiot.

731
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:42,446
If I were an idiot,
I'd be driving a Trans Am.

732
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:43,881
If you were driving a Trans Am,

733
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:46,884
you would be the smartest idiot
in the whole world.

734
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:49,686
Idiot.

735
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:52,656
You're the idiot.

736
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,291
Nice comeback.

737
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,627
I was making fun
of your comeback.

738
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:59,129
That's why it worked.

739
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,600
I totally got the best
of that interchange.
