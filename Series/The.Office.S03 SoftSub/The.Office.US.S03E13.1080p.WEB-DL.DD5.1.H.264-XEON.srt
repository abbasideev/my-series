1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,134
I have left Dunder-Mifflin

2
00:00:02,136 --> 00:00:04,636
after many
record-breaking years,

3
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:07,172
and I am officially
on the job market.

4
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,407
And it's very exciting.

5
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:09,575
For your convenience,

6
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:11,510
I've broken it down
into three parts:

7
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,412
professional résumé,

8
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:15,781
athletic
and special skills résumé,

9
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:17,950
and Dwight Schrute trivia.

10
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:20,085
I am ready
to face any challenges

11
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,021
that might be foolish enough
to face me.

12
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:23,455
How would I describe myself?

13
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:24,690
Three words:

14
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:25,824
Hardworking,

15
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,659
alpha male,

16
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,895
jackhammer.

17
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:30,963
Merciless.

18
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:32,664
Insatiable.

19
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,401
There's nothing on my horizon
except everything.

20
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:37,636
Everything is on my horizon.

21
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,405
I got this job
to make some money

22
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:41,840
while I continue
my employment search.

23
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:43,108
And, uh...

24
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,843
it's fine for the time being.

25
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:45,978
Oops.

26
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,579
Break's over.

27
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,289
Big Turkey.

28
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:11,236
Is that you singing?

29
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,237
All four parts.

30
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,639
Recorded it on my computer.

31
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:15,240
It took me forever.

32
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,251
You gonna answer it?

33
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:29,388
I called it myself.

34
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,889
I just thought you'd get a kick

35
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:31,890
out of the new ring.

36
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:32,558
Yikes.

37
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,725
Side note:

38
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:34,793
I'd just like
to say I'm thrilled

39
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,095
to be working
directly beneath you.

40
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,497
- Oh.
- I feel I have a lot to learn from you.

41
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:41,433
Even though you're younger
and have less experience.

42
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,669
So...

43
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,504
here's to the future.

44
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:47,473
Andy and The Tuna.

45
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,253
I miss Dwight.

46
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,591
Congratulations, Universe.

47
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:07,559
You win.

48
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,497
Argh, top won't go up.

49
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:51,003
Oh, hey hey!
Look who's here.

50
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,105
- Hello, hello.
- Hi, Michael.

51
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:55,974
Welcome back.
- Good to see you.

52
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:59,645
As you know, Oscar is a gay man,

53
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,547
who is also my friend

54
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,815
and he has been on
a little bit of a sabbatical...

55
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:04,650
...recently.

56
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,418
Seeing the world.
Finding himself.

57
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,253
Having lots of fun, no doubt.

58
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:09,488
What does that mean?

59
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,324
Oooh, check out the new car.

60
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:15,594
German engineering, nice. How
many pesos did that set you back?

61
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,095
It's a company lease.

62
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,263
From the settlement.

63
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,865
After you kissed me.

64
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,801
Well, that's how this company
takes care of our employees.

65
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,770
When we settle, we settle high.

66
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:27,573
I have an idea:

67
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:27,973
Rainbow stickers, all over
the back windshield.

68
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:30,509
Shout it from the mountain tops,
my friend.

69
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,177
Part of me wants the people
in this office

70
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:35,214
to have learned their lesson,
and just shut the hell up.

71
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,317
And part of me thinks...

72
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,484
"You know what?
Keep talking.

73
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,753
I'd really love
a home theater."

74
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,122
Yes, Dwight Schrute
has left the company...

75
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:45,824
more personnel turnover.

76
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,259
Cost of doin' business.

77
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:49,728
Yeah, well, it is a big loss.

78
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,964
Dwight was the top salesman.

79
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,432
Was the top salesman.

80
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:54,600
I said "was."

81
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:57,269
Addition by subtraction.

82
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:59,071
What does that even mean?

83
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,639
That is impossible.

84
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,773
Mmm...

85
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,609
Yeah, you're right.

86
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,844
But there is some good news.
Oscar is back.

87
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,380
Addition by addition.

88
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:11,116
So we are going
to have a big party today

89
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,685
to welcome him back,
and hopefully

90
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,621
that'll lift everyone's spirits.

91
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:18,156
- Hey.
- Oscar!

92
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,591
- Pam.
- Good to have you back.

93
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,525
Good to be back.

94
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,196
- Welcome back, Oscar.
- Thank you.

95
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,864
- Good to be back.
- Hey, Oscar.

96
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,232
Hey, everyone.

97
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,934
Oh, hello, Oscar.

98
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,535
How was your gay-cation?

99
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,671
That's very funny.

100
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:32,671
Yeah?

101
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,673
I thought of that, like,

102
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,742
two seconds after you left.

103
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,181
Hi, Angela.

104
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:45,951
Oscar.

105
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,020
Hey, boss.

106
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,154
Hey, what's up?

107
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,689
Nooothin'.

108
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,526
Enhrrr... hehh.

109
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:58,463
Man, TGI Wednesday.

110
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,865
Yeah.
- Am I right?

111
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:00,966
Yep.

112
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,201
Gonna go home, get my beer on,

113
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:05,871
get my Lost on.

114
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,773
What are you doin' later?
You want to hang out?

115
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:09,941
Uh... I don't know.

116
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,043
Maybe.

117
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,312
Well, I'll take that
as a "maybe."

118
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,287
Where you goin'?
- Bathroom.

119
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:23,555
Well, I'm going to the kitchen.

120
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:24,890
I'll walk with you.

121
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,265
Yeah, things
are goin' pretty good.

122
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,834
Gettin' a lot of face time
with the boss.

123
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:40,939
Oscar?

124
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,042
I have a question.

125
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:47,012
Would you like to join
the Party Planning Committee?

126
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,513
The committee
with all the women?

127
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,548
Yeah.

128
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,716
Because I'm gay?

129
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:52,351
- No.

130
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:53,952
No.

131
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,788
Certain events have transpired,

132
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,625
and I've thought
about certain things.

133
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:01,960
And I'm sorry for the way

134
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:05,163
those certain events transpired.

135
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,399
And I would just like
to make some changes

136
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:10,001
about certain things

137
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,870
and certain situations.

138
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:12,938
Okay, okay.
- And certain accountants.

139
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,939
All right, all right, I'll join.

140
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:14,940
I'd love to.

141
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:15,974
That's...

142
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,175
Thank you.

143
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,176
Thank you.

144
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,311
Thank you.

145
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,882
Can I join too?

146
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,285
Never.

147
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,654
You sell those two printers
this morning?

148
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:30,922
Nice work.

149
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,023
Child's play.

150
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,659
Give me something hard to sell.

151
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,665
Hey, where's Dwight?

152
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:41,800
You didn't hear?

153
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:44,469
Decapitated.
Whole, big thing.

154
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,538
We had a funeral for a bird.

155
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,242
I'm pretty sure
none of that's real.

156
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,811
You're not real, man.

157
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,580
Wow.

158
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,249
What is wrong with this thing?

159
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,617
It looks terrible.

160
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,018
Do you want me to ask
the night cleaning crew

161
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,019
if they stopped watering it?

162
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,020
Yeah.

163
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,321
Oh, you know what?

164
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,323
Ask them about the toys
on my desk too.

165
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,859
They always used
to arrange the toys on my desk

166
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,295
in a... a very pleasing way.

167
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,663
It used to brighten my morning.

168
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,298
Oh, that wasn't the night crew.

169
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,399
That was Dwight.

170
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,769
Really?

171
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,138
That was very nice of him.

172
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,308
We need more attitude like that
around this office.

173
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,010
Feel ya, dawg.

174
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,244
Yeah, do you?

175
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,913
Absolutely.

176
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,648
What did I say?

177
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,451
You said...

178
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,486
Ruh-duht duh duh-dooh.

179
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:35,554
Huh.

180
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:36,555
Which is, like,

181
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:37,722
"Right on."

182
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,291
Pam was like,
"Blah blah blah."

183
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:42,794
And you were like,
"Yeah. Psh-sht."

184
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,063
Nailed it.

185
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,369
Oh.

186
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,138
Oh, no.

187
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,173
Love that Andy, right?

188
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,775
Solid fellow?

189
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:57,843
Seems smart enough.

190
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,911
Likes me a lot.

191
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,246
A lot.

192
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,081
Too much.

193
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,151
Like a crazy person, a little.

194
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,754
Not super crazy, just...

195
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:12,157
there's something about him
that creeps me out.

196
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,392
I can't really explain it.

197
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,628
He's always up in my bidness,

198
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,165
which is Ebonics
for "being in my face

199
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,534
and annoying
the bejesus out of me."

200
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:25,370
I don't understand how someone

201
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:28,106
could have
so little self-awareness.

202
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,014
I really have no preference.

203
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,549
We don't even have
to have a party.

204
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,284
No. Hey, hey...

205
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,352
Don't be ridiculous.

206
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,721
Of course we are going
to have a party,

207
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,656
a celebration of Oscar.

208
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:45,857
Oscar night.

209
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,959
And I want it
to be Oscar-specific.

210
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,060
Michael, I...
- No, no.

211
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,962
I mean, not...
not because you're gay.

212
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,197
Your gayness

213
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,698
does not define you.
- Okay.

214
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,068
Your Mexican-ness
is what defines you to me.

215
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,672
And I think we should celebrate
Oscar's Mexicanity.

216
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,407
So... Phyllis,

217
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:06,211
I want you
to go find firecrackers...

218
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,646
and a Chihuahua.

219
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:10,916
Pam, in the frozen food section,

220
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,817
Swanson makes
a delightful chimichanga.

221
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,653
Why don't you have me
riding in on a donkey

222
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,821
into the office, like Pepe?

223
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,323
Ah... a burro.
Of course.

224
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:21,326
If Oscar wants a donkey,
let's get him one.

225
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,263
Need any help?

226
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,766
Oh, no thank you.

227
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,734
I'm... I'm just looking.

228
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:30,835
Great.

229
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,208
I will literally
be standing right here

230
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,511
if you need anything at all.

231
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,049
Okay.

232
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:49,487
I think I could go for some
tuna fish right about now.

233
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:52,324
Oh, oh, oh, got my rod here.

234
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,559
Whizzzzzz...

235
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:55,660
Bloop.

236
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,496
Click, click.

237
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,198
Click, click, click.

238
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,600
Click, click.

239
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:02,834
Click, click, click, click.

240
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,069
Click, click, click, click.

241
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,103
Click, click,
click... Argh!

242
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,404
Oop! Oh.

243
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,106
I got one.
I got one.

244
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,207
Eeh!

245
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,577
Hey.

246
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,346
Hey.
- Hey.

247
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:18,350
So, Andy is in rare form today.

248
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:21,152
Yeah, you should
not encourage him.

249
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,587
Encourage him?

250
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,656
I'm the victim, okay?

251
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,024
He's fishing for me.

252
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,292
We've got to do something.

253
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,161
Look, I've got,
like, 15 new clients

254
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,329
that I've inherited from Dwight,

255
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,031
and each file
is password protected

256
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,399
with a different
mythical creature,

257
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,835
so... I'm sorry.

258
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,070
I can't.

259
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,839
Fine.

260
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,407
Party pooper.

261
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,445
Oop! Ooh.
Rah!

262
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,680
Unh!

263
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:49,714
Ooh!

264
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,516
Ah! Whoa!

265
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,652
Who's that sportscaster
that bit that lady?

266
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,120
Marv something?

267
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:56,121
Floppin' around!

268
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,288
Andy is like Marv something.

269
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,324
Great sportscaster...

270
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,626
big, weirdo creep.

271
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:04,229
185 pounder.
Check it out.

272
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,798
Whew!
Ahh!

273
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,673
Hey, Ryan?
- What?

274
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,474
Do you wanna pull a prank
on Andy?

275
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:21,079
Not right now,
but ask me again 10 years ago.

276
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,150
I liked you better as the temp.

277
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:26,885
Me too.

278
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,388
Hey, guys.

279
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,823
How's the workload

280
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:34,659
on all of Dwight's old accounts?

281
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:35,593
Handling it okay?

282
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,096
Sort of.
He had a lot of clients.

283
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,964
Yes, he did.

284
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,633
Have any of you

285
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:43,001
talked to Dwight?

286
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,069
Oh, sure.

287
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,570
We talk all the time.

288
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,305
Really?
- No.

289
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,506
Don't... don't do that.

290
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:49,908
That's not nice.

291
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,609
What about you, Phyllis?

292
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,178
You and Dwight were close.

293
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,513
No. Sorry.

294
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:56,848
Dwight had a big personality,

295
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,950
and I have a big personality.

296
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,218
And a lot of times

297
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,053
when two people like that
get together,

298
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,089
it can be explosive.

299
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:06,758
Really comin' down out there.

300
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,827
Commute's gonna be hell.

301
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:11,162
I have snow tires and chains.

302
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:14,332
Plus exceptional
eye-hand coordination.

303
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:19,270
So, um, where were you
workin' before this?

304
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,972
Dunder-Mifflin.

305
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,974
What kind of company is that?

306
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,111
Paper company.

307
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,913
They're only one of Staples'
top competitors in the area.

308
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,784
I never heard of 'em.
- Whoa.

309
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:35,086
Really?
Have you heard of paper?

310
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,256
It's gonna be like that, huh?

311
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,126
I don't like him,
his giant head,

312
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,094
or his beady little eyes.

313
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,196
That's all I got to say
on the matter.

314
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,088
Would you like
to pull a prank on Andy?

315
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,157
I'm kind of in the middle
of... Yes, please.

316
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,324
Okay, good.

317
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,626
Stay right here.

318
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,133
- Oh.
- Sorry about that.

319
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,601
Good move, Tuna.

320
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,069
Nice one.

321
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,741
Are there any messages?

322
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:30,842
Nope.

323
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:31,843
So weird.

324
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,111
Hmm.

325
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:45,323
Nice to have Oscar back.

326
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,424
Yeah.

327
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,665
So how much do you
love Lance Bass now?

328
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,467
I don't know who that is.

329
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,169
You don't know
who Lance Bass is?

330
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,371
He's only one of the five
best singers ever,

331
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,440
and, gay.

332
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,208
I've never heard of him.

333
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,678
Oscar, you really need to learn
more about your culture.

334
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,829
I'm not fine.

335
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:01,266
And no, I don't want
to talk about it.

336
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,868
All right.
- Okay, fine.

337
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,704
What do you think of Andy?

338
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,406
Uhm...

339
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:12,076
Because on paper, Andy and I
should be best buds.

340
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,013
We even have the same Top Ten
All-Time Favorite Movie list,

341
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:17,715
down to the number.

342
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,184
Andy's a "Yes-man."

343
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,352
Not all the time.

344
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,055
Sometimes I'll say
I don't like something,

345
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,124
he says he
doesn't like it, either.

346
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,193
Right.

347
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,596
He'll always agree
with whatever you say.

348
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,165
He did the same thing with Josh
in Stamford.

349
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,537
If he did that with Josh,
he could be doing that with me.

350
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,509
When I was five years old,
I had these Spiderman pajamas.

351
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:47,345
And one night,
my mom was tucking me in,

352
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:52,684
and she tried to give me
a raspberry on my tummy.

353
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:54,519
You know...
pff-f-ft...

354
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:57,422
...and, uh,
I tried to crawl away,

355
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,290
and what happened was,

356
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:03,094
her eyes were closed,
and she grabbed me...

357
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,830
...and she kissed me

358
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:08,399
on my butt.

359
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:11,402
And it was just the worst.

360
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:17,608
So I know what it's like
to have your butt kissed.

361
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,378
...literally.

362
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,648
And it-it-it's terrible.

363
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,718
And it better not be
what Andy is doing.

364
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,333
Um... Large Tuna.

365
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,236
Have you seen
my cell phone device?

366
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,474
'Cause someone
is calling right now.

367
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:50,541
There is a call.

368
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,230
Angela?

369
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,268
Is everything okay?

370
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,138
No.

371
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,306
I miss him.

372
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,608
Dwight?

373
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,310
No.
John Denver.

374
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,479
Okay.
That's a good talk.

375
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:31,649
Wait, I'm sorry.

376
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:34,218
He's gone because of me.

377
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,188
I told him I would be upset
if people knew about us,

378
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,224
so he didn't have an alibi
for Michael.

379
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,660
I denied him.

380
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,797
I still think there's a way
you can explain it to Michael.

381
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,198
...somehow.

382
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,334
Pam, I am not like you.

383
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,703
Walking around in your
provocative outfits,

384
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:56,741
saying whatever thought
pops in your head

385
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,310
Yeah... that's me.

386
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,749
Thank you.
This was helpful.

387
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,596
What are you talkin' about?

388
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,032
Where is my freaking phone?

389
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,236
You know what?
Maybe it's in the ceiling.

390
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:28,072
You know what?
Maybe you're in the ceiling.

391
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,044
I don't trust you, Phyllis.

392
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,084
Michael?

393
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,185
Yes?

394
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:43,421
Never mind, you're busy.
I'll come back tomorrow.

395
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,389
No, what is it?

396
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:46,457
I...

397
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,063
I just...

398
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:52,063
I wanted to let you know

399
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,764
that Dwight
was late that morning

400
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,199
because he had
to drive to New York

401
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,302
to drop off the correlated tax
forms that I forgot to send.

402
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,908
Though to be fair,
Kevin never reminded me.

403
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,879
Why would Dwight
do that for you?

404
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:11,048
I think I know why.

405
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:16,754
Because Dwight would do that
for anyone here.

406
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:21,325
Because Dwight
loves this company, that's why.

407
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,061
Do you think that anyone else
out there

408
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:25,830
would have driven
to corporate for you?

409
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,632
None of them...

410
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,468
especially not Andy.

411
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,288
Pam, I have a mission
to accomplish.

412
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,989
Make sure this party
gets rolling,

413
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,224
and I will be back shortly.

414
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,358
Hey-oh.

415
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,459
Where are you going?
Do you want me to come with?

416
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:56,694
Um...

417
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:57,828
Just listen.

418
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,598
I forgot to tell you the plan
for this Saturday:

419
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,334
you, me, bar, beers, buzzed...

420
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,203
wings, shots, drunk.

421
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,271
Waitresses hot.

422
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:10,708
Football... Cornell/Hofstra:
slaughter.

423
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,144
Then quick nap at my place,
and we hit the tiz-own.

424
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:14,212
No.

425
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,380
I don't want to do any of that.

426
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,682
Duh.

427
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,550
Which is why
I was joking about doing it.

428
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,118
No, just stop. Stop.

429
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,118
Just stop doing it.

430
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,621
You're going to drive me crazy.

431
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,125
Fine, I'll just go sit
at my desk and be quiet.

432
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,695
Sorry I annoyed you
with my friendship.

433
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,204
And I'm also sorry

434
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:42,206
that a lot of people here

435
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,242
for some reason think it's funny

436
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,344
to steal
someone's personal property

437
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,411
and hide it from him.

438
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,615
Here's a little news flash.

439
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:52,083
It's not funny!

440
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,753
In fact,
it's pretty freakin' unfunny!

441
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:00,658
Oh, my God!

442
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,059
Ow!

443
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,869
That was an overreaction.

444
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:16,007
Gonna hit the break room.
Does anybody want anything?

445
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:16,907
Pam, you good?

446
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,242
Yeah.

447
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,310
Sure? Okay.

448
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,516
I made a mess.

449
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,852
I forced Dwight
to resign prematurely,

450
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:30,254
and I replace him with Andy,

451
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:34,325
who loves this place so much,
he punched a hole in it.

452
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:36,627
It's a mess.
A big mess.

453
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,896
And it's weird,
because this is not like me.

454
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:43,601
I am usually the guy they call
in to clean up the mess.

455
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:50,508
Well, I guess today, I am going
to have to call in myself.

456
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,816
Eh.

457
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,592
Dwight.

458
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,461
Dwight!

459
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,163
I'm sorry.

460
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,901
No, that question
is meaningless.

461
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,469
Just go with the copy paper.

462
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:19,904
It's your funeral.

463
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:21,539
See how that works out for you.

464
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,643
Hey.

465
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:28,546
Hey.

466
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:29,780
What's up?

467
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,384
Same old.

468
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,955
Um...

469
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:45,763
It takes a big man
to admit his mistake.

470
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:48,299
And I am that big man.

471
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:51,602
Angela from accounting
told me what you did.

472
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,037
Oh, my God, she told you?

473
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,305
Yes, she did.

474
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:56,240
And, Dwight...

475
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:59,777
if you were willing
to do something like that

476
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:01,979
for some random co-worker,

477
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:08,252
then clearly I misjudged you
from the beginning...

478
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,721
and I apologize.

479
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,726
Accepted.

480
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,032
How's this place treating you?

481
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:24,435
The boss isn't funny.

482
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:25,469
Ooh, well.

483
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:26,637
I don't get to wear my ties.

484
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:27,638
No.

485
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,672
I'm sure.

486
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:29,707
So?

487
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,409
So maybe you should come back.

488
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,812
You should come back.

489
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:36,580
Please.

490
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,917
I don't want
to do your laundry anymore.

491
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,587
We can talk about that.

492
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,128
All right.

493
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:03,841
Oh, my God.

494
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:05,810
That's half-inch drywall.

495
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:07,711
I think we broke his brain.

496
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,283
It's not freakin' funny.

497
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,520
Are you enjoying your fiesta?

498
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:17,855
Actually, yeah.

499
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:20,024
I didn't think
I would, but turns

500
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:21,492
out it's great.

501
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:22,993
Ladies and gentlemen!

502
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,495
May I present...

503
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:25,729
Mr. Dwight Schrute!

504
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:27,031
- Yay.
- Yay.

505
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,037
Welcome back.

506
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,072
Thank you.

507
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,411
Okay, Dwight,
you can let go of her hand.

508
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:41,912
You're gonna break it.

509
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:45,182
Not bad, huh?

510
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,784
You did this for me?

511
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,921
Guilty.

512
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,898
Where'd you get this stuff?

513
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,166
Gerdy's.

514
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,601
Which aisle?

515
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:04,902
I don't remember.

516
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:07,304
Well, draw me a map, mama.

517
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,407
Pam.

518
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:12,409
I will shake mine,
and then you will-

519
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:14,478
No, I will not.

520
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,086
My God...

521
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,557
So does this remind you
of your childhood, or anything?

522
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,262
It reminds me a lot
of The Three Amigos,

523
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:33,864
with Steve Martin
and Chevy Chase.

524
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,833
Wow.
Thank you.

525
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:39,370
Wow, that's...
Thanks so much.

526
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,078
Hey.

527
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:57,354
Do you still have feelings
for her?

528
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:04,862
Yes.

529
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:24,815
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the big finale.

530
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,117
Sir, would you do the honor?

531
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,620
Oh, man.

532
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,123
No, no, no.

533
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,792
I don't need it.

534
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,595
Get out!

535
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,434
It takes a big man
to admit his mistake,

536
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,836
and that's what I did.

537
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:48,172
The important thing is...

538
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:50,441
I learned something.

539
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:53,777
I don't want somebody
sucking up to me

540
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,614
because they think
I am going to help their career.

541
00:26:56,616 --> 00:27:00,618
I want them sucking up to me

542
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:05,089
because they genuinely love me.

543
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:06,657
Hmm.

544
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,027
So Michael had
a little chat with corporate,

545
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:14,164
and they decided to send me
to management training.

546
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:17,434
Anger management, technically,
but still...

547
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:19,837
...management material.

548
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,106
This whole thing is supposed to
take ten weeks,

549
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:23,440
I expect to be done in five.

550
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:23,440
How?

551
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:26,043
Name repetition,
personality mirroring,

552
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:30,414
and positive reinforcement
through nods and smiles.

553
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,483
So, don't worry about
old Andy Bernard,

554
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,051
I'll be back.

555
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:35,119
...just like Rambo.

556
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:36,987
- Oh, hi, you must be Andy.
- Oh, hi.

557
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:40,024
Yes, I am,
and you must be Marcy.

558
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:41,392
That's right.
It's so good to meet you.

559
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:43,594
- It's so good to meet you.
- Thanks.

560
00:27:43,596 --> 00:27:46,330
- Well, ready to have some fun?
- Yeah.
