1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:02,401
Bleaah!

2
00:00:02,403 --> 00:00:04,003
Okay, where does it hurt?

3
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,205
Just... all over.

4
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:08,674
I...don't want
to do anything.

5
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:09,675
I'm dying.

6
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:10,876
No, that's not how it works.

7
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:12,011
You have to point
to a specific part

8
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:13,312
of the body.

9
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:15,781
Right there.

10
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:16,949
"Abdomen."

11
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:19,118
"Menses."
Maybe.

12
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,320
"The uterus contracts after
your egg passes through it."

13
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:22,721
Not it.
I don't have eggs.

14
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,390
So when did this start?

15
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:25,758
About ten minutes ago.

16
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,292
When I came in
with the paperwork?

17
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:28,427
Mm-hmm.

18
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,963
About 40 times a year,
Michael gets really sick,

19
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:33,065
but has no symptoms.

20
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:35,501
Dwight is always
gravely concerned.

21
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:37,936
Ooh, is it possible you ate food

22
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:39,405
that contained animal waste?

23
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:40,806
It's possible.

24
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:42,408
Michael?
- Huh?

25
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,976
David Wallace is on line one.

26
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:45,411
You see a phone?

27
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:46,545
Oh.

28
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:47,913
All right, everybody out.

29
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,448
Out, out, out.

30
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,783
Okay...

31
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:53,318
To what do I owe this
great honor, David Wallace?

32
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,054
Michael, I am calling...

33
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:56,955
And Gromit.

34
00:00:58,092 --> 00:00:59,525
Jan?

35
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:01,160
Is Jan there?

36
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:03,028
Jan is out of town right now.

37
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,130
Oh, you sigh like Jan.

38
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:08,834
I broke Jan's heart, David,
and I feel awful.

39
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:10,502
It was...

40
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:13,772
It was never my intention
to ruin a life.

41
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,841
But you know what?

42
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:17,876
- Sometimes...
- Michael?

43
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,612
You just gots
to get your freak on.

44
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:21,613
- Michael?
- Yeah?

45
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:22,981
- Michael?
- Hmm?

46
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:25,651
I'm calling to see
if you would come down

47
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:27,252
and interview for a job

48
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,787
we have opening up in corporate.

49
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,689
Really?

50
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,091
A week from today.

51
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:34,359
Bring your first-quarter stats
and your recommendation

52
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,161
for who'd take over
the Scranton branch.

53
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:37,896
Wow.
Mm-hmm.

54
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:41,366
I wish I had prepared
something to say.

55
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:42,367
That's not necessary.

56
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:47,106
May God guide you in your quest.

57
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:48,474
Yes.

58
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,741
Okay, everybody have
their towels

59
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,277
and swimsuits?

60
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,712
We have about
an hour and a half.

61
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:28,614
I suggest that
you all go potty now.

62
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:30,082
And then we will be congregating

63
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:31,617
on the par-tay bus.

64
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,652
Oh, I'm excited...
today is beach day.

65
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:34,987
Michael is taking
the whole office

66
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,255
to the beach.

67
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:39,057
So I'm wearing my bathing suit
underneath my shirt.

68
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:42,861
Oh, yeah, I packed it
in my purse.

69
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,696
Oscar, you brought
your Speedo, I assume?

70
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,298
I don't wear a Speedo, Michael.

71
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,301
Well, you can't swim
in leather pants.

72
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,969
Ha ha ha.

73
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,871
I'm just yankin' your chain.

74
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,406
Not literally.

75
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:55,908
Anybody need sunblock?

76
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,242
It's got an SPF 30.

77
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,111
Oh, you know what?

78
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,879
Uh, you're not going.

79
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,080
It's beach day.

80
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,316
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry, Toby.

81
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,384
We, um...

82
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:07,586
Somebody has to stay here.

83
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,689
I want today to be
a beautiful memory

84
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,226
that the staff and I share
after I have passed on

85
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:16,195
to New York.

86
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:19,031
And if Toby is a part of it...

87
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,133
then it'll suck.

88
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,068
Hey...

89
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,603
want my sunscreen?

90
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,205
Oh, great.

91
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,774
I forgot mine,
and I'm wearing a two-piece.

92
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:30,509
Ahh.

93
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,578
Thanks, Toby.

94
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,081
Hey, Pam,

95
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,450
I have a very important job
for you today.

96
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,319
I thought we were just
having fun at the beach.

97
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,520
We, are, we are.

98
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:44,289
But I would like you
to take notes.

99
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,925
And I want you to find out
about people's character.

100
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:50,262
You know,
not their hotness, per se,

101
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:53,498
but their humor
and their charisma.

102
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,268
And the indefinable quality

103
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,503
that makes you all glad
to follow me.

104
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:02,040
What happens to a company
if somebody takes a boss away?

105
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,776
I will answer your question
with a question.

106
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:08,280
It's like what happens
to a chicken...

107
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,315
when you take its head away.

108
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,484
It dies.

109
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,821
Unless you find a new head.

110
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,423
I need to see
which one of these people

111
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:22,794
have the skills
to be a chicken head.

112
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,797
You want me to write down
people's indefinable qualities?

113
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:26,865
I want you to write down
everything

114
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,600
that people are doing all day,

115
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,203
and then type it up
in a way that is helpful.

116
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:32,638
All right?

117
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,073
I have the most boring job
in the office,

118
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,876
so why wouldn't I have
the most boring job

119
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,444
on beach day?

120
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:43,548
This way
to the par-tay bus.

121
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,783
I just want to lie on the beach

122
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,085
and eat hot dogs.

123
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,920
That's all I've ever wanted.

124
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:16,982
Uh-huh.

125
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:31,530
Everybody, may I have
your attention, please?

126
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:37,002
Today we are not just
spending a day at the beach.

127
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,338
Oh, sweet mother of God.

128
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,672
If you don't like it, Stanley,

129
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,507
- you can go to the back of the bus.
- Excuse me?

130
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,544
Or the front of the bus,
or drive the bus.

131
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:48,046
Just...

132
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:52,918
We are all participating
in mandatory fun activities.

133
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,520
Funtivities!

134
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,523
And there is a special
secret prize for the winner.

135
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,958
Yes, funtivities!

136
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,526
I knew it wasn't
just a trip to the beach.

137
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,627
Okay, you know what?

138
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,663
Your enthusiasm
is turning people off.

139
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,565
I hope there will be
management parables.

140
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:07,566
Well...

141
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,234
Hey, Pam,

142
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,736
did you get that down?

143
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:11,903
Like what?

144
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,106
Like everything I said,
and everything they did.

145
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:15,640
- Just don't...
- Well, no.

146
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,142
- Write it down before you forget it.
- I don't remember exactly...

147
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,243
That's...

148
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,512
You've just been
drawing pictures.

149
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,748
Rrrrr-rrrrr!

150
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,516
I can't stay mad at you.

151
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,952
Here we are,
ladies and gentlemen.

152
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,520
Everybody ready?

153
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,989
Last one down is a rotten egg!

154
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,624
Watch out for snakes.

155
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,962
- Everybody put on sunscreen.
- All right...

156
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,830
find a cozy spot.

157
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,599
Everybody settle in.

158
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,439
Okay, everybody up.

159
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:50,008
Circle around.

160
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,410
Let us play some games.

161
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,746
We are situated
on the northeast corner

162
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,249
of scenic Lake Scranton.

163
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:01,186
America's eight largest
indigenous body of water.

164
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:05,323
It is here that a group
of Americans

165
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,793
will undergo
the ultimate challenge.

166
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:12,264
One day, 14 strangers
who work together...

167
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,765
but only one survivor.

168
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,966
What?!

169
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,803
Just words...
inspiring words.

170
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,004
Not a contender.

171
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,273
For the competitions,
you will be divided

172
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,841
into four tribes.

173
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,376
Each tribe will have a leader

174
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:26,845
that I will pick randomly
off the top of my head

175
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:27,846
without thinking.

176
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:31,383
Jim, Dwight, Andy, and Stanley.

177
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:32,951
Yes!
Choose your tribes.

178
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,987
Except for Pam.
Not Pam.

179
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,489
Jim Halpert.

180
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:38,657
- Karen.
- Pros:

181
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:43,061
smart, cool, good looking.

182
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:46,264
Remind you of anybody you know?

183
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:49,034
Cons:
not a hard worker.

184
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:51,736
I can spend all day
on a project,

185
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,038
and he will finish
the same project

186
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,406
in a half an hour.

187
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:56,074
So that should
tell you something.

188
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,576
I choose Michael!

189
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,911
I'm not playing.

190
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,546
Okay, temp.

191
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:05,584
Dwight is an obvious candidate
for my job.

192
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,320
He has the best sales record
in the office.

193
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,256
He loves the work.

194
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:13,792
He is, however, an idiot.

195
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,927
We are going to choose
team names... Dwight.

196
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,395
We will be called Gryffindor.

197
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:18,964
Really?
Not Slytherin?

198
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,465
Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.

199
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,700
I know.

200
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,135
Okay, we will be Voldemort.

201
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,804
He who must not be named?

202
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:26,972
I wouldn't do that.

203
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:28,673
Voldemort.

204
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,442
Okay, seriously...
Voldemort!

205
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:32,110
Voldemort, Voldemort...
- You really shouldn't be say...

206
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,345
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Voldemort.

207
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,113
- Voldemort!
- Idiots!

208
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,182
Okay, okay, Stanley,
your team name.

209
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,050
I don't care
what you call my team.

210
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,186
Then I will name your team
the red team.

211
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,188
No, the blue team.

212
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,024
I am also considering Stanley,

213
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,961
because of all the good
that black people have done

214
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:52,264
for America.

215
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:54,132
We will be team U.S.A.

216
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,400
Very good.

217
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,536
Pam, please take a note
that Andy is patriotic.

218
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,471
Andy Bernard.

219
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:02,774
Pros:
he's classy, he gets me.

220
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:05,076
He went to Cornell.

221
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,745
I trust him.

222
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:10,282
Cons:
I don't really trust him.

223
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:13,218
It is time for the great
spoon and egg race.

224
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,786
This one is with a little twist.

225
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,187
There's already a twist.

226
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,423
You're carrying an egg on a spoon.
Shh.

227
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,359
The person carrying the egg
will be blindfolded.

228
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,627
Please put on your blindfolds.

229
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,129
That person carrying the egg

230
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:26,231
will go down, circle a torch,
come back,

231
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,800
deposit their egg in the pail.

232
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,101
First team back is the winner.

233
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:33,805
All right, ready, set, go!

234
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,441
Come on, Phyllis, you can do it.

235
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,476
Thank you so much.

236
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,645
Phyllis is out, yes!
Follow my voice.

237
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:44,249
Yeah, keep it moving,
keep it moving right this way.

238
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,317
Looking good, whoo!

239
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:46,451
I don't want to hit
the big rock.

240
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,452
Don't worry, you're not...

241
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:48,553
I know I'm near the big rock.

242
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:50,322
- I just know it.
- Nowhere near the big rock.

243
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,691
What are you doing?
No!

244
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,161
See, now we're disqualified.

245
00:09:56,163 --> 00:10:00,999
I am okay if I lose
every single contest today.

246
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,001
Honestly.

247
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:08,506
Because I see these contests
as an opportunity for me

248
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:11,076
to demonstrate
what a good sport I am.

249
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,877
Mallard.

250
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:15,747
Whoa, stop, stop, stop...
there's a hole.

251
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:16,748
Just step over the hole.

252
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,016
A hole?
Yep.

253
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,884
Come on, lazy bones, move it!

254
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,653
Perfect.
Ooh, just made it.

255
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:22,654
Okay, turn left.

256
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,089
Come on, andale, arriba, arriba.

257
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,090
You have to stop this right now,

258
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,257
or I'm not gonna
do this anymore.

259
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,726
What are you saying?

260
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,160
You have to stop yelling at me,
or I'm not go do the egg race.

261
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,428
Okay, I apologize
for yelling at you.

262
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,796
That's what being
a good captain is about.

263
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,465
I'm trying to bring team spirit.

264
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,866
Whoa, stop...
another hole.

265
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,301
Take a big step.

266
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,203
Yes!

267
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,337
Oh, my God!

268
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,972
You ass!

269
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,843
There's nothing better than
a beautiful day at the beach,

270
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:50,148
filled with sun, surf,
and, uh, diligent note taking.

271
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,251
Pam, you're missing things.

272
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,965
Let's go!
Let's go!

273
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,800
Come on, mush!

274
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,669
Mush!
Come on, you bastard!

275
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,737
What the...

276
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,105
Damn it, temp!

277
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,042
Great job, everyone.

278
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,477
That was fantastic.

279
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:25,316
Okay, Pam, I have another
little project for you.

280
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,584
Does it have to do
with these shopping bags

281
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:27,619
filled with hot dogs?

282
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:28,620
Smart as a whip.

283
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,789
Yes, these are precooked,

284
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,424
so it's not absolutely
necessary,

285
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:35,060
but I would appreciate it if
you could heat up 800 hot dogs

286
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:37,128
for a little contest
I'm going to be having.

287
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,797
I would greatly appreciate it.

288
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,798
When's the contest?

289
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,599
Like, um, ten minutes.

290
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:44,636
- How am I supposed to get...
- Thanks a bunch.

291
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,708
A good manager
has got to be hungry.

292
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,576
Hungry for success.

293
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,378
Okay, who's hungry?
No, no, no.

294
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,714
Do not touch the food,
please, not yet.

295
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:59,284
That is our next event...
a hot dog eating contest.

296
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,252
For those of you
who are curious,

297
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:05,957
the world record
is 54 1/2 hot dogs.

298
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,092
Wow!

299
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:08,193
And you know what?

300
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,228
I personally have
cooked up enough

301
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,362
so that each
and every one of you

302
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,897
could break that record.

303
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,399
So shoot for the stars, okay?

304
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,202
All right, the team that eats
the most hot dogs in ten minutes

305
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,070
will be declared the winner.

306
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,272
On your mark, get set...

307
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:22,407
Can I have a turkey burger?

308
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,442
No, I have the only one.

309
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,944
I claimed it.
Ready?

310
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,145
Turkey is a healthy meat.

311
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:29,848
I don't eat meat, Michael.

312
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,316
I'm not gonna eat this.

313
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:32,817
Guys, guys, come on.

314
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,420
Please, let's just... okay.

315
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,589
It's very important
that you all try to eat

316
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,324
as many hot dogs as you can.

317
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:42,026
On your mark, get set,

318
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,128
eat!

319
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,462
Is there any mustard?

320
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,131
No mustard, no mustard.

321
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,399
Just eat it...
eat it, Phyllis.

322
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,667
Dip it in the water

323
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:52,170
so it'll slide down
your gullet more easily.

324
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,938
Come on, the winner gets
a big, big prize.

325
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,874
- What is it?
- I can't say.

326
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:57,942
You can't say,
or you can't pronounce it?

327
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,944
The winner gets
a regional manager's salary

328
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,147
for a year,
and a Sebring, and the feeling

329
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,882
that they are making
a difference in the world.

330
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,250
Can we just take
those first two things?

331
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,786
The winner of today gets my job.

332
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,489
Okay?

333
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,625
I'm interviewing for a job
at corporate.

334
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,927
And they're only interviewing
a handful of people,

335
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:18,963
and I'm the most qualified,
and I'll probably get it.

336
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:19,964
All right?

337
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,733
You're leaving?

338
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,168
I didn't want to tell anybody.

339
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,737
I didn't want to cast a pall
over our fun beach day.

340
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,672
But you know what,
I don't know who to recommend,

341
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,407
because, frankly,
nobody is stepping up.

342
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:32,243
I am so hungry!

343
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:33,711
Do you expect me to believe

344
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,480
that you're truly
making your recommendations

345
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,981
on this basis?

346
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,516
Word.

347
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:43,555
There we go.
Let's see it.

348
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:45,323
I would rather work
for an upturned broom

349
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,624
with a bucket for a head

350
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,560
than work for somebody else
in this office

351
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:50,228
besides myself.

352
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,462
Game on.

353
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:52,997
Four seconds,

354
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,266
three, two, one.

355
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,669
Stop!
No eating!

356
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,104
And the winner is Andy Bernard,

357
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:03,241
- with 14 hot dogs.
- Team U.S.A.!

358
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:04,242
One came up.

359
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:05,677
13 hot dogs, everybody.

360
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,112
Damn it!

361
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,081
Aw, nobody told me
we were gonna nave hot dogs.

362
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,355
What?
What are you saying?

363
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,057
- Did you say 'sandwich?'
- No.

364
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,259
I was saying that before.
Not now.

365
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:24,495
Now I am saying...
Sabotage...

366
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:28,967
...the ancient Dutch art
of screwing up your own team.

367
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,969
I knew you were saying
'sabotage.'

368
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,972
I was giving you
an example of it.

369
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,341
I will misunderstand
everything that Andy says,

370
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,309
until he goes insane.

371
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,779
If Michael organizes
some kind of group hug,

372
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,248
stand next to me.

373
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,651
It's very simple,
there are only three rules.

374
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:49,020
You must not touch the ground,

375
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,489
you must not step outside
of the ring,

376
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:55,526
and you must always wear
the safety mittens.

377
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,395
- What safety mittens?
- We don't have any safety mittens.

378
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,897
I probably left them
in the trunk of my car.

379
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,031
It's all right, here we go.

380
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,933
Go get 'em, big boy!

381
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:04,936
And go!

382
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,004
Come on, Jim!

383
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,171
Rrrrrrrrrrr!

384
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,172
Whoa, what are you doing?

385
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,808
- Come on!
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!

386
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,544
Nice, Stanley!

387
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,446
Sorry about that.

388
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,382
It's all about taking points
away from Dwight.

389
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,717
Yeah, no, good, okay.

390
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:23,454
Oh, my God...
I have never seen that look

391
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,924
in a man's eyes ever.

392
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:29,427
I thought that I might die.

393
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,263
On beach day.

394
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,301
- Come on!
- Come on!

395
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:39,470
If either of these guys
are put in charge of the office,

396
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:40,672
I will transfer to Albany.

397
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,173
Gil can come if he wants.

398
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,308
I'm kind of looking
for a way out

399
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,742
of that relationship anyway.

400
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:47,345
I think I might try girls
for a while.

401
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,881
Angela thinks I can cross over.

402
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:50,915
We'll see.

403
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,517
Aah!

404
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,718
One, two, three!

405
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,087
Yeah! Yeah!

406
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,155
Excellent.

407
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,790
Gryffindor!

408
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,692
Gryffindor!

409
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:02,994
I didn't win.

410
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,662
But the only reason
I didn't win is

411
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,664
because I recently learned
that it's better

412
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,366
to work things out with words.

413
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,001
That's not why you lost.

414
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,269
Yeah, it is.

415
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:12,904
I totally could have
kicked your butt so bad.

416
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:14,639
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, right!

417
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,541
Yeah, right.
Come on!

418
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:20,078
Unh!
Unh!

419
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,013
Aah!

420
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,081
How do you like that?!

421
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,159
Oh, God...

422
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,062
Aah! Help!

423
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,697
Help!

424
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,033
Angela...
Angela, hey!

425
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,502
Oh, thank God.
Go tell somebody.

426
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,471
What, Andy?

427
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,772
Andy, what should I tell them?

428
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:50,241
Go tell them
I'm floating away, obviously!

429
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,910
I don't understand
what you want from me.

430
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,779
Angela, it's pretty simple.

431
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:58,116
Look at what I'm doing,
and go tell somebody it!

432
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,485
Sorry.
Aah...

433
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,420
Bye, Andy.

434
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:03,988
Angela!

435
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,724
I knew that finding a successor
would be difficult.

436
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:09,761
I did not know that
it would be impossible.

437
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:13,297
Thus far, the candidates
have been wildly disappointing.

438
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,366
Uh, Jim is not
taking it seriously,

439
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,435
uh, Stanley is having a stroke,

440
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,037
and Andy... where is he?

441
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,938
Where the hell is Andy?

442
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,774
Where is he, Pam?

443
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,409
Do you know?

444
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:26,844
Who's ahead in points?

445
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,279
I think they're even.

446
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,349
At various times,
you gave Jim ten points,

447
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:34,852
Dwight a gold star,
and Stanley a thumbs up.

448
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,487
And I don't really know how
to compare those units.

449
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,523
Well, check to see
if there's a conversion chart

450
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:39,757
in that notebook.

451
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,760
- I really doubt it, Michael.
- Please just check.

452
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:43,961
Great.

453
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,596
Yeah, I'll see you next week.

454
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:46,597
Thank you.

455
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,132
And here is Karen Filipelli.

456
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:50,301
Bye.

457
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:51,969
Hello?

458
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,105
Yeah, hi, David.

459
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,840
Yes, I would like
to be considered

460
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,275
for the corporate position
in well.

461
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,177
"In well?"
As well.

462
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:01,913
How would that work...
in well?

463
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,881
- I just want to know.
- Yes, uh-huh.

464
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,917
- Wait a minute...
- That would be fine.

465
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,018
This job is in a well.

466
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,419
- I don't want it.
- Cut it out!

467
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,787
I don't.

468
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:14,525
What does a great manager need
most of all?

469
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,526
Courage.

470
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,862
How so?

471
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:20,364
I mean, sure thing,
that sounds smart.

472
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:21,899
I can't do this anymore.

473
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,701
I'm going to sit in the bus.

474
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:26,003
Your loss, Stanley.

475
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:29,107
Meanwhile, the rest of us
will have a super-fun time

476
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,875
defeating our fear,

477
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:33,211
and creating a lasting memory...

478
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:37,982
walking through fire!

479
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:44,055
Who among you has the guts
to replace me?

480
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:48,359
Let him walk across these coals.

481
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,798
Are you gonna try it?

482
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,999
I'm not gonna walk in the fire

483
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,101
after your disgusting feet
have gone through.

484
00:18:57,103 --> 00:19:00,404
Angela, it is a million degrees.

485
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,540
I'm gonna do it.

486
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,675
And I fully expect
to burn my feet

487
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,310
and go to the hospital.

488
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:10,982
That's the right spirit
when doing a coal walk, right?

489
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,416
No, no, not you, Pam.

490
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:13,551
You have to keep score.

491
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:15,286
- I'd like to try.
- Pointless.

492
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:17,855
- But I'm not kidding.
- Okay?

493
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,857
This is about guts.

494
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,393
It takes guts to be
a regional manager.

495
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,795
Jim, you're up.

496
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,063
Nope.

497
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,899
Ju... why not?
Come on.

498
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,568
Oh, 'cause I don't want
my feet to get burned.

499
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,505
You do not have what it takes

500
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,973
to be a regional manager.

501
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,575
That's harsh.

502
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:38,576
Who's next?

503
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,144
Andy.
Where's Andy?

504
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,713
Andy is never here today.

505
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,818
Hello?
Who's there?

506
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,687
My name is Andrew Bernard.

507
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,190
I was with a group
called Dunder-Mifflin.

508
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,461
Hello?

509
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,096
Why don't you go, Michael?

510
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,798
Because I already did.

511
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,866
Remember?

512
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:05,036
I burned my foot
on the George Foreman grill.

513
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,505
That is not the same at all.

514
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:08,973
If you're gonna ask
other people to do it,

515
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,508
you should do it yourself.

516
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,742
All right, okay, all right.

517
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,177
I'll do it.

518
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,248
Okay.

519
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,419
Okay.

520
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,998
The mind has to wrap around...

521
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,300
the foot.

522
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,219
Okay.

523
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,524
You're not doing anything.

524
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:02,260
You want us to count to three?

525
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,362
Yes, count to three, please.

526
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:07,064
Three, two, one.

527
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,232
Count the other way.
Count...

528
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:09,600
No, no, count one, two, three.

529
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,601
Not three, two, one.

530
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,472
One, two, three.

531
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,007
- Go, Michael.
- Do it.

532
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:18,709
Wait, am I going on "go,"
or am I going on "three"?

533
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,711
On the go that's after three.

534
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:21,746
Okay.

535
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:26,984
One, two, three, go!

536
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,392
No!

537
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:35,760
It's okay.

538
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:36,894
I will do this, Michael.

539
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,129
Don't, Dwight.

540
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,831
I will walk and stand
on these coals

541
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,633
until you award me the position

542
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,302
of regional manager!

543
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,507
Wow.

544
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,208
- Dwight.
- Dwight.

545
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,877
Aaah!

546
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:53,911
Ow.
Get off there.

547
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:55,212
Get off, get off.

548
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:56,681
Give me the job!

549
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:57,782
Give me the job!

550
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:58,916
I'm not going to give it to you.

551
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,584
Ow, oh!

552
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,219
Don't kneel on the coals!

553
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,723
Michael, do something!

554
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:08,326
God, that stinks!

555
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,897
Being a boss is also
about image.

556
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:15,866
I've never looked like that.

557
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:18,102
That was gross.

558
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:20,037
I just... I don't see
the connection

559
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,274
between a fire walk
and management.

560
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:25,109
Worst 75 bucks I ever spent.

561
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:26,477
You know what?

562
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,912
If I had to pick my replacement

563
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,613
based on today,

564
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:32,316
it would be
Mr. Outside Hire.

565
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:33,984
Or Mrs. Outside Hire.

566
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:37,021
Yeah, mm-hmm, true.

567
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,389
Look, I don't...

568
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:41,759
I don't want to leave
this branch the I love

569
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:43,194
to an outside hire.

570
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,830
Therefore, we're going to have

571
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:48,866
a 100-point
winner take all

572
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:52,036
sudden death
tribal counsel round

573
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,873
to test the aspect of my job

574
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,108
that I think is
the most important.

575
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:00,244
Something I call
the Bob Hope factor.

576
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,680
- Who's Bob Hope?
- God!

577
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:04,915
He's a, he's a comedian.

578
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,384
Oh, like Amanda Bynes.

579
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,752
Who's Amanda Bynes?

580
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:09,520
She's from What a Girl Wants.

581
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:11,155
Oh, I love that movie.

582
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:13,090
Yes, Kelly is right.

583
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,092
The person to replace me

584
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:18,496
has to have
a great sense of humor.

585
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:21,866
And they have to possess
the leadership qualities

586
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:23,901
of a Bynes or a Hope.

587
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,776
So without further ado,

588
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:35,713
Jim and Dwight...

589
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:37,214
show us what you've got.

590
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,285
Hey, I know what
you're looking for,

591
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:43,954
but I gotta be honest.

592
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:45,489
I really don't think
I should be considered

593
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:46,991
as your replacement.

594
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:49,493
You are being too modest.

595
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,395
Michael, on Thursday,
I'm gonna drive down

596
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:54,832
and interview with David for
the open position in New York.

597
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:00,337
Okay, that is not funny.

598
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:03,741
I am deducting 60 points

599
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:05,543
from Voldemort

600
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:07,111
for false pretenses.

601
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,747
Okay, Dwight, your turn.
Wow us.

602
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,550
The Aristocrats.

603
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:15,119
A man and his wife and children

604
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,254
go into the offices
of a talent agency.

605
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:27,131
And the talent agent says,
"Describe your act."

606
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:31,769
And the man says something
really, really raunchy.

607
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:33,838
And the talent representative
says,

608
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
"What do you call
yourselves?"

609
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:38,976
And the man says,
"The Aristocrats."

610
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,314
Ooh, ah!

611
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,548
Whew!

612
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,117
Ho ho!

613
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:51,155
I mean, truly repulsive acts.

614
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,724
That is a very,
very funny story.

615
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:57,261
Hey, I want to say something.

616
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:59,463
I've been trying to be
more honest lately,

617
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,232
and I just need to say
a few things.

618
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:02,533
I did the coal walk.

619
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,201
Just, I did it.

620
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,737
Michael, you couldn't even
do that.

621
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:08,973
Maybe I should be your boss.

622
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:14,411
Wow, I feel really good
right now.

623
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:16,714
Why didn't any of you come
to my art show?

624
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:19,783
I invited all of you.

625
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,152
That really sucked.

626
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:23,654
It's like sometimes
some of you act

627
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:25,022
like I don't even exist.

628
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,030
Jim, I called off my wedding
because of you.

629
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,766
And now we're not even friends.

630
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:38,235
And things are just, like,
weird between us,

631
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,070
and that sucks.

632
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:42,973
And I miss you.

633
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:45,342
You were my best friend
before you went to Stamford.

634
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:49,046
And I really miss you.

635
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,382
I shouldn't have been with Roy.

636
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:55,152
There were a lot of reasons
to call off my wedding,

637
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:56,954
but the truth is
I didn't care about

638
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:58,822
any of those reasons
until I met you.

639
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:00,958
And now you're
with someone else.

640
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,459
And that's fine.

641
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,428
It's whatever...

642
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,429
that's not what I'm...

643
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:06,597
I'm not...

644
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,898
Okay, my feet really hurt.

645
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,199
The thing that I'm just trying

646
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:10,935
to say to you, Jim,

647
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:14,605
and to everyone else
in the circle, I guess,

648
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,574
is that I miss
having fun with you.

649
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,778
Just you, not everyone
in the circle.

650
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:28,852
Okay, I am gonna go walk
in the water now.

651
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:32,556
Yeah, it's a good day.

652
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:37,194
Pam, that was amazing.

653
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,530
But I am still looking
for someone

654
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:41,298
with a sales background.

655
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:15,766
Wilmaaaaaaaaaa!

656
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:16,934
Nice.
