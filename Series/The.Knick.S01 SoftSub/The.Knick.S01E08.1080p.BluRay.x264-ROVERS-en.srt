1
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,512
Use it on me.

2
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,399
This is all I got here.

3
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,278
Please, please.
It feels so good when you do it.

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,158
Douse it.

5
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,119
Hurry.

6
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,313
My father was right.

7
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,230
The devil is in all of us.

8
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,954
My father preaches on weekends
around the county.

9
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,311
He never met a person he didn't believe
had a sinner inside them.

10
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,673
Oh, it must have been
great fun growing up with that.

11
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,435
Guilty before you're even tried.

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,269
If he could see me here with you...

13
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,239
Men like that would rather be proven right
than anything else on Earth.

14
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,590
You know, my father
is as devout as they come.

15
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,240
He prays, quotes scripture,

16
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,992
never misses a Sunday.

17
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,193
He's also a drunkard.

18
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,913
A mean, violent son of a bitch.

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,350
After the war, he slaughtered Indians

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,908
in the Colorado territory for a living.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,230
He believes the former forgives the latter.

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,470
I believe the latter's all that matters.

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,078
That's the devil your father
should be speaking of.

24
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,879
Sex, pleasure,

25
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,115
immodesty,

26
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,398
us here now,

27
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,437
this is no sin.

28
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,269
Will you be there on Judgment Day
to make my case, then?

29
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,952
God's not watching.

30
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,710
He's too busy not saving sick children
and letting people starve.

31
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,794
But if He does exist, He's the one
that should be doing the atoning, not you.

32
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,511
Don't say things like that.

33
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,080
You're here with me now.

34
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,796
Do you want to be or not?

35
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,477
I do.

36
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,911
Good.

37
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,713
Good morning, Nurse Elkins.

38
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,438
Good morning.

39
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,034
There's a new exhibit
at the Metropolitan Museum

40
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,394
that I think you might like.

41
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,872
I didn't know if you had
any plans for this weekend,

42
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,873
but I've really enjoyed our time together.

43
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,393
And I promise there'll be none

44
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,392
of these lurid, naked
French Polynesian women...

45
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,072
Nurse Elkins. Dr. Chickering.

46
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,593
- Good morning, Doctor.
- Doctor.

47
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,670
There'll be none of these lurid,

48
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,150
naked French Polynesian women
that they showed last year.

49
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,756
Strictly lily ponds and seascapes and the like.

50
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,276
I think the curators have
duly learned their lessons.

51
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,920
Why is there no cocaine?

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,070
Because of the war in the Philippines.

53
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,390
The guerillas have started
attacking our cargo ships.

54
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,555
Some have been sunk,
many have been not able to pass.

55
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,039
There are shortages of all sorts

56
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,430
from chestnuts from Malay,
teakwood from Siam,

57
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,829
-coca leaves from Java.
-I'm not interested in chestnuts

58
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,876
or Siamese teakwood.

59
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,748
We're a hospital. We need cocaine to exist.

60
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,592
Well, then our existence is in doubt

61
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,159
because we used the last of it yesterday.

62
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,549
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Doctor.

63
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,394
Dr. Thackery, a few final questions
about our hernia paper presentation.

64
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,075
Fine, just bring it to my office
after the board meeting.

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,314
Excuse me.

66
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,509
Excuse me.

67
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,239
That’s unacceptable.

68
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,392
How can they refuse to pay?
They’re our insurer.

69
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,790
Don't they know
how this will affect us financially?

70
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,317
Our insurance is for
flood damage and fire protection.

71
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,472
The riots would have had to
fall into one of those categories

72
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,676
or be an act of God.

73
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,354
And an act
of godless doesn't qualify.

74
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,716
Then what are we paying
$35 a year in insurance premiums for?

75
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,313
Had there been a flood or a fire...

76
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,949
Seems we'd have been better
off putting a torch to the place ourselves.

77
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,828
It certainly would make it easier to walk away
from this wretched building.

78
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,433
I say we explore it.

79
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,988
Burn down the hospital?
Is that legal?

80
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,150
I was referring
to a move uptown

81
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,674
to a more hospitable location, Monsignor.

82
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,990
The riots were unfortunate, but...

83
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,798
They were a damned disgrace.

84
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,839
Attacked by the very people to whom
we practically give our services away for free.

85
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,515
Is there any more proof needed
that it's time to abandon this place?

86
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,513
Perhaps if we better understood
our losses, Mr. Barrow.

87
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,591
Yes...

88
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,036
I have compiled a partial list

89
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,350
of what was damaged by the hooligans.

90
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,350
Nineteen windows, $3 each.

91
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,591
Seven lab kits, $4 each.

92
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,474
One upright cabinet, $2.10.

93
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,309
One long cabinet, $5.40.

94
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,197
One medium-length cabinet, $2.20...

95
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,157
And the list goes on and on.

96
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,992
What about the drugs?

97
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,395
Drugs.

98
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,311
We're out of cocaine.

99
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,038
We're aware, Doctor.

100
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,236
It's a vital anesthetic. Our patients need it.

101
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,594
Barrow?

102
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,592
Short of launching a ship
and stopping the attacks,

103
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,557
there's little we can do.

104
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,437
There must be some supplies of it in the city.

105
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,318
I mean, it's your product.
You're only too happy to sell it to us.

106
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,391
Now we can't even get a lick of it.

107
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,319
There's just none to be had.

108
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,231
Someone must have some.

109
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,595
We supply all the hospitals, so I assure you,

110
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,395
they're all out or critically low.

111
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,674
We can't make the drug without the leaves,
and we don't have the leaves.

112
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,193
We haven't made or shipped a bottle in weeks.

113
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,111
So there are no stores of it?

114
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,237
-No supplies of any kind?
-Whatever there was has been exhausted.

115
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,759
Nothing for the beverage makers,

116
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,957
the elixir chemists,
physicians or pharmacists.

117
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,795
For the foreseeable future, all institutions
are going to have to work without cocaine.

118
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,189
What is it?

119
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,269
That cow Mallon petitioned a judge

120
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,237
to get herself removed from quarantine.

121
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,117
-He's gonna hear it.
-Why?

122
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,270
The tests proved
she was a carrier for typhoid.

123
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,713
She needs to be kept away.

124
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,956
Well, she got herself a lawyer to claim

125
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,554
that she's been imprisoned
without due process.

126
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,834
Hearing's on Tuesday.

127
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,194
Maybe we can get her
to make some peach melba for the judge.

128
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,793
See what happens.

129
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,758
Yes?

130
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,559
I found them for you.

131
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,758
I have three, but I wanted
to save one for us to share.

132
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,758
Come in.

133
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,751
Ah. Good. Dr. Edwards.

134
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,356
Thanks for your help, Nurse Elkins.

135
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,237
Greatly appreciated.

136
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,070
Most of the changes I made
are to the postoperative care section.

137
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,394
It's a good paper.

138
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,949
I only wish I were allowed in to hear it.

139
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,719
-Are you all right?
-Fine.

140
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,438
What time is the conference?

141
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,834
-At 3:00.
-Great.

142
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,831
I'll let you know how it goes.

143
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,593
She's beautiful.

144
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,828
And very healthy.

145
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,593
That combination can only mean
she's of Irish stock.

146
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,472
And you think she's about six months?

147
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,391
Give or take.

148
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,072
We named her Elisha.

149
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,515
And we've been going
by her middle name, Grace.

150
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,240
But you and Eleanor
should make her your own.

151
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,118
I'm sure you have ones in mind.

152
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,316
No, Grace is perfect.

153
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,468
Let's hope Eleanor falls for her
as quickly as I have.

154
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,392
Gentlemen,

155
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,750
welcome to the 83rd meeting

156
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,594
of the Metropolitan Surgical Society.

157
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,069
In past years, we have been privileged to learn

158
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,914
of so many new, groundbreaking discoveries,

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,991
and I'm certain that this quarter's gathering

160
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,270
will be no exception.

161
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,238
I want to remind you all

162
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,997
that nominations for the Thessler honoree
for breakthroughs in nephrology

163
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,117
are due by the end of this month.

164
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,830
Our treasurer tells me that
we have a surplus of $22.07

165
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,390
in the general fund,
most of which will be put toward

166
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,313
our much-needed chimney repair.

167
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,119
A reminder. We will be sitting

168
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,273
for the annual photograph
directly following today's reception.

169
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,349
My coauthor Dr. Edwards and I
rebuild the canal's posterior wall

170
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,796
using a three-layer repair
approximating the medial tissues.

171
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,393
The transversalis fascia,

172
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,311
the transversus abdominis muscle,

173
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,470
and the internal oblique muscle

174
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,596
to the edge of the inguinal ligament.

175
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,238
Once the wall is created,

176
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,232
we suture the external oblique aponeurosis,

177
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,197
thus recreating the canal

178
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,714
and the external inguinal ring.

179
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,151
Now, failure rates for previous procedures

180
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,271
ranged from 30 to 50%.

181
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,271
In our admittedly small sample,

182
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,955
the Thackery-Edwards method
has a re-herniation rate of only 2%,

183
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,195
and that is due to a patient not following
proper postoperative instructions.

184
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,350
Our full paper will be available to you all,

185
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,159
and we believe you'll have
great success with this new procedure,

186
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,156
as it is probably the biggest advance

187
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,153
in inguinal hernia surgery
in the last 100 years.

188
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,270
Thank you, Dr. Thackery.

189
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,477
Once again, you've come and impressed.

190
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,676
Would you be willing to take any questions?

191
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,994
No.

192
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,639
Very well.

193
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,671
Our next presenter has recently arrived

194
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,548
with great fanfare from
the University of Chicago,

195
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,518
lured here by none other than the esteemed

196
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,751
Jacob Schiff of Kuhn & Loeb,

197
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,348
to continue his groundbreaking surgical work

198
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,829
at Mount Sinai Jews' Hospital,

199
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,991
Dr. Levi Zinberg.

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,116
I'm always nervous when it's mentioned

201
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,113
that I was persuaded to come
to New York by a banker.

202
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,074
Even my 10-year-old son
asked if I was brought here

203
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,670
to surgically remove people's
wallets from their pockets.

204
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,637
Cutting people open is what we surgeons do.

205
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,234
But often we haven't any idea

206
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,835
if the site of the incision
is even remotely correct.

207
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,190
The stone we are seeking

208
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,668
may be nowhere near our first cut.

209
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,239
We might believe there is esophageal trouble,

210
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,790
but until we lay the patient open
and invade him,

211
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,917
well, we have no idea if we are correct.

212
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,635
The pain and suffering

213
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,840
caused by our indiscriminate scalpels
is great indeed.

214
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,718
And I have endeavored to change that,

215
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,274
With this.

216
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,192
This

217
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,117
is the Illuminating Intrascope.

218
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,034
Now, you may wonder
why I didn't name my invention

219
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,315
after myself, as so many other surgeons do.

220
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,110
But the reality is that
anything named after a Zinberg

221
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,556
will always be at the end of the book.

222
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,516
With this device,

223
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,989
I can make a small incision,

224
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,634
place the Intrascope into the wound,

225
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,314
turn on its built-in light source,

226
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,117
and actually see inside the human body.

227
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,992
If the patient is
sufficiently relaxed with opium,

228
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,958
the Intrascope can be placed
down a patient's throat

229
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,674
to observe the esophagus or larynx.

230
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,273
Through an incision,
it could be placed near a broken bone

231
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,158
or in the urinary tract.

232
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,151
Or even to probe the intestines.

233
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,799
Gentlemen,

234
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,634
we are healers.

235
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,872
And the fewer incisions we make,

236
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,190
the better our patients will heal.

237
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,031
With my Intrascope,

238
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,720
we can stop being butchers

239
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,238
and start truly being surgeons.

240
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,271
Dr. Thackery.

241
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,477
I'm sorry I wasn't able to introduce myself
before the proceedings began.

242
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,438
Oh, I think you introduced yourself
quite well during them.

243
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,875
Thank you. Levi Zinberg.

244
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,316
And you must either be
Gallinger or Chickering.

245
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,992
By the age, I'd say Gallinger.

246
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,277
-Yes, Everett Gallinger.
-Dr. Chickering Jr.

247
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,476
You've been doing your homework
on the competition.

248
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,398
Nonsense. We're all in this together.

249
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,592
Your team is well-known throughout the city.

250
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,989
I'm eager to read your hernia paper

251
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,638
and put that discovery into practice.

252
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,075
And I'm eager to own
one of your magic scopes,

253
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,309
as I'm sure everyone here is.

254
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,154
Yes, well, it'll be a while
before we reach that point.

255
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,310
But now that people know of its existence,

256
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,039
I hope others will quickly surpass me.

257
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,031
I've never hoped that in my life.

258
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,953
I am presenting my new previa procedure
at the next meeting.

259
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,837
I see you're also on the list of speakers.

260
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,751
May I ask what it is you'll be presenting?

261
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,152
I'd rather not say.

262
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,959
It was nice meeting you all.

263
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,997
He'd rather not say.

264
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,753
-Can he do that?
-He just did.

265
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,150
I suppose we're not as
"all in this together" as he claims.

266
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,117
The arrogance is astonishing.

267
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,998
Rest assured that this will be the last time

268
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,718
you were ever outshined by a Jew.

269
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,515
I must be going.

270
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,194
Sister Harriet is meeting me
to bring home a little surprise to Eleanor.

271
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,714
We will drink a toast to your new family.

272
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,677
Cheers. I'm starving.

273
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,672
-Is there no food again?
-Through there.

274
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,149
-Oh, good.
-Scotch.

275
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,553
Thank you.

276
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,712
Dr. Thackery.

277
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,876
Dr. Chickering.

278
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,871
I was hoping for a word.

279
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,679
But by the looks of you,
an examination might be more in order.

280
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,716
Are you unwell? Your color is terrible.

281
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,711
Just a bit too much work.

282
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,671
You wanted to speak about Bertie, I presume.

283
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,671
About Bertram Jr. Yes.

284
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,558
You wish to commend me for
my excellent mentorship of the young man

285
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,714
and to show your gratitude
for the influence I've had on him.

286
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,791
You have to let him go.

287
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,348
The boy is in your thrall. It's no good for him.

288
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,237
-You need to send him off.
-To what?

289
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,390
There's nothing out there that compares
to what I'm giving him.

290
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,675
It's what you're taking from him
that is at issue.

291
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,318
He's free to go anytime he wishes.

292
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,550
I hold no special power over him.

293
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,632
You hold enormous power. He worships you.

294
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,115
-And that carnival you run.
-Circus.

295
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,636
Where his former surgical chief
put a gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger.

296
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,676
It was his temple, actually.

297
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,672
It was over a procedure
that your son helped me conquer.

298
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,914
A procedure that will save thousands of lives.

299
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,033
There are
good surgeons everywhere.

300
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,109
Let him learn from one of them.

301
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,549
Good is not enough.
Good does not change the world.

302
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,039
But it can change his life.

303
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,435
He can get married, have a family

304
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,715
and an excellent, lucrative practice

305
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,438
away from the tumult of The Knick.

306
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,476
If the goal is money or ease,

307
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,118
then, yes, I agree with you.

308
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,715
But I assumed our job was to heal
and to save lives.

309
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,152
You are aware how false
any sanctimony is coming from you, correct?

310
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,992
Of course.

311
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,036
Perhaps with a word from both of us,

312
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,193
we could place Bertram
with someone like Dr. Zinberg.

313
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,836
I knew you disliked me,

314
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,117
but until now, I had no idea how much.

315
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,435
You would prefer your son to work

316
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,829
at the Jewish hospital instead of with me?

317
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,917
I would take him working
for the Tsar over you.

318
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,554
Dr. Chickering, your son is very talented.

319
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,710
I've invested a lot of time and energy into him,

320
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,839
and I am telling you,
he possesses real greatness.

321
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,673
Whatever you have invested in the boy,

322
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,516
I can assure you, I have infinitely more.

323
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,076
Good afternoon.

324
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,830
Good evening, dear.

325
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,831
I didn't know
you were bringing a guest.

326
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,359
I would have tidied up.

327
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,512
That's quite all right.
I won't be staying long.

328
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,831
This is Grace.

329
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,708
She's a healthy six-month-old baby
abandoned at The Knick.

330
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,711
Oh, the poor thing.

331
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,711
Are you out for a walk with her?

332
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,032
No, dear.

333
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,511
Sister Harriet is bringing Grace to us.

334
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,477
- To us?
- Mmm.

335
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,239
Grace will be our daughter.

336
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,312
Oh, no. I can't.

337
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,392
This could be exactly what we need.

338
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,959
I won't do that to Lillian.

339
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,358
Lillian is gone.

340
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,952
And we can't bring her back.

341
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,512
We must begin to look forward.

342
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,630
Isn't that right, Sister?

343
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,549
God has placed this child here for a reason.

344
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,358
No, God has cursed us.

345
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,592
We have proven we are incapable
of caring for a child.

346
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,752
And I won't be responsible
for the death of another.

347
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,879
Please, take the baby out of here
before we infect it.

348
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,269
-Eleanor.
-Go!

349
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,759
Now!

350
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,876
Of course. I'm sorry, Mrs. Gallinger.

351
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,033
Harriet.

352
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,753
- Give it to me.
- What are you doing?

353
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,592
Give it to me. Give it to me.

354
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,633
Come here. Come here.

355
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,998
-Look at her.
-Get it away.

356
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,991
-Look at her!
-I can't.

357
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,116
She needs a mother.

358
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,554
Stop, Everett. Please.

359
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,715
Thank you, Jesse, but I'm gonna stay
and work for seven more hours.

360
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,438
Of course. I'll be here waiting, then.

361
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,715
No, don't be silly. It might be late.

362
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,870
You should go home
and I'll find my own way back.

363
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,517
Find your own way, ma'am?

364
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,989
I'll be fine here. You take your time.

365
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,036
No, please. I insist.

366
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,192
-You can head back.
-Yes, ma'am.

367
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,759
I'll see you at the house.

368
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,353
Diggs Hotel, 26th and 6th Avenue.

369
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,591
I'm not sure a woman like you
should have any business in a place like that.

370
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,433
And I'm quite sure
you have no business questioning me.

371
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,112
Now, please.

372
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,352
I said, you know,

373
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,032
"You're gonna have to pay that rent for us."

374
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,951
You know where she is?

375
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,715
You seem to be working late a lot
these past few weeks.

376
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,711
When I'm not out of the house for evenings

377
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,429
at the opera, the ballet, and, apparently,

378
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,876
even a symposium at the
Natural History Museum on dinosaur bones,

379
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,155
which I'm sure would have been fascinating.

380
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,277
It's impossible to keep you at home
at night at all anymore.

381
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,669
I just can't help myself.

382
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,309
I yearn for culture
and thirst for entertainment.

383
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,878
You seem very passionate about it.

384
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,634
lam.

385
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,396
I hope I can continue to keep
your curiosities satisfied.

386
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,508
Based on experience,

387
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,750
I have no doubt you will.

388
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,750
Aren't you scared of what we're doing?

389
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,433
I'm only scared we won't be able to stop.

390
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,710
Could you pass that vial, please?

391
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,077
Are we gonna do it again?

392
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,357
So soon?

393
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,228
No, I have some work to do downstairs.

394
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,598
You're shaking.

395
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,352
Let me do it.

396
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,589
Thank you.

397
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,952
May I come in?

398
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,639
I couldn't sleep.

399
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,715
Would you like me to make you a cup of tea?

400
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,717
-John?
-What?

401
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,233
I just thought you might like a cup of tea.

402
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,799
No, thank you.

403
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,471
Will you please put that back?

404
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,758
I think I'll go home.

405
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,353
Fine.

406
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,391
You're in early this morning.

407
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,993
I couldn't sleep.

408
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,991
I'm sorry to hear that.

409
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,354
What kept you up?

410
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,112
Maybe I can help.

411
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,510
It's nothing you need to worry about.

412
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,598
You're right, I don't need to worry about it,

413
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,396
but that doesn't prevent me
from worrying about it, however.

414
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,913
Bertie, could you come
and see me in my office?

415
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,989
Of course.

416
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,390
-Morning, Nurse Elkins.
-Good morning, Doctor.

417
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,075
I'll write you a
prescription for a large, hot cup of coffee.

418
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,352
You're very sweet.

419
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,433
You look worse this morning
than you did at the conference.

420
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,749
I might have a touch of something.

421
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,031
I've reworked our previa papers.

422
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,519
I thought you were happy with it.

423
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,029
I was until I saw what Zinberg presented.

424
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,712
We can't be outdone by him.

425
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,429
We are at the forefront
of discovery and technique.

426
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,033
Everything we do.

427
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,590
Everything, even the words we put on paper

428
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,558
must be above and beyond expectation.

429
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,630
This is gonna make you, Bertie.

430
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,317
Now, your father

431
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,960
will have a hard time arguing with that.

432
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,632
Yes, he will.

433
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,631
Is this the final draft before we print?

434
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,314
Well, I don't see how
we can make that any better.

435
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,834
I'm due back on the ward.

436
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,269
Just take your time.

437
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,868
Now, the Roosevelts’ hospital’s
got their hands on some of the drug.

438
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,513
But the Hospital for the Ruptured
and Crippled does, too,

439
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,352
thanks to Mr. Frick.

440
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,988
I wanted to give you the opportunity
to do the same for us.

441
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,310
It seems I've had more
than my fair share of opportunities recently.

442
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,836
The electrification, the new x-ray machine,

443
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,118
covering the cost of cleaning up
after the recent riots.

444
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,953
For which we are eternally grateful.

445
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,032
It's not writing a check that irks me.

446
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,953
It's the unceasing assumption
that I always will.

447
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,952
I have done more than my fair share recently,

448
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,918
and you have come back to the well
one too many times,

449
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,195
Mr. Barrow.

450
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,592
If I seem presumptuous,

451
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,156
it is only because I have never met a man

452
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,037
who's shown greater generosity

453
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,712
than you have toward us.

454
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,872
And I will again, but today is not that day.

455
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,235
Those ships that are going down,

456
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,111
those are my ships.

457
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,633
That's my cargo.

458
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,472
Those are my customers who are demanding

459
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,238
I pay them for their losses.

460
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,151
Two ships at the bottom of the sea already,

461
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,516
another limping to the dock in Saipan.

462
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,592
I am supposed to be making money

463
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,955
on this war, not losing it.

464
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,269
And I understand that the well is dry...

465
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,759
The well is far from dry.

466
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,755
It's simply you're the man with the bucket
about whom I am least concerned right now.

467
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,439
It is only a few thousand dollars.

468
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,952
Then you should have no trouble
finding it elsewhere.

469
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,792
Mr. Tuttle, age 52.

470
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,874
No alcoholism or syphilis.

471
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,713
Swelling in his right jaw
began approximately five weeks ago.

472
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,951
And just prior to that,
Mr. Tuttle had two teeth extracted.

473
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,712
And you believe they're linked.

474
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,358
It would appear so.

475
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,715
Swelling in the jaw has increased slowly

476
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,030
and if you feel the location,

477
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,951
the edges are quite hard.

478
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,637
Conclusion?

479
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,153
Actinomycosis.

480
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,754
Not uncommon in the wake of dental surgery.

481
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,189
- Treatment so far?
- Iodide of potassium.

482
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,191
Ninety grains three times a day for two weeks.

483
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,236
I think it's time
we go in and remove the mass.

484
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,630
Will someone please shut that man up?

485
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,548
You were saying?

486
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,237
I believe
it's too soon to operate.

487
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,551
I'd agree
if there had been any improvements.

488
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,677
But quite to the contrary,
Mr. Tuttle's mass seems to have grown larger.

489
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,716
Well, let's prepare him for surgery.

490
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,631
Both of you assisting.

491
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,670
- Are you feeling all right?
- I'm fine!

492
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,876
Now if everyone would
just stop asking me that

493
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,033
and just take care of the people here
who are actually ill.

494
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,154
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Tuttle,

495
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,951
and promise we will take
excellent care of you.

496
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,508
He's brusque,

497
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,437
but he's a fine surgeon.

498
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,198
As long as it isn't you doing it,

499
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,510
he can yell all he wants.

500
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,916
You do such a wonderful job

501
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,117
aiding Sister Harriet
with her work for the children

502
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,758
of this blighted city.

503
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,554
But you can understand
that the rest of our hospital

504
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,710
is in need of the Lord's help as well.

505
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,472
Of course, Mr. Barrow.

506
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,233
Our concern is always for everyone in need.

507
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,194
We treat so many of your people.

508
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,638
Italians.

509
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,553
Spanish. Polacks.

510
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,154
And the Irish.

511
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,151
Regardless of the cost,

512
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,470
we would never turn them away.

513
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,755
It's a godly thing you're doing.

514
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,638
I feel it every day, Archbishop.

515
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,717
But now,

516
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,997
we need supplies in a hurry

517
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,435
and we just don't have the funds.

518
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,159
Well, with a half-million wretched immigrants

519
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,793
coming into this city each year,

520
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,233
the pinch is on everywhere.

521
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,993
It's a bind we understand completely.

522
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,518
I knew you would.

523
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,070
We fund so many
Catholic hospitals of our own,

524
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,072
do work in the poor neighborhoods
with the immigrants,

525
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,515
that the drain is enormous.

526
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,876
So much so that we really
have nothing left to give.

527
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,359
I'm sorry, Mr. Barrow,

528
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,908
the Church can't spare another penny.

529
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,838
More tea?

530
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,955
No.

531
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,753
Thank you.

532
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,070
Surely Dr. Thackery or Dr. Gallinger

533
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,912
could have come to the hearing in your place.

534
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,555
I did many of the tests
involved with Miss Mallon,

535
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,518
so Thack thought... Well, Dr. Thackery

536
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,354
thought I should be the one
to represent the hospital.

537
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,079
He's giving me more and more responsibility.

538
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,072
How is the previa paper coming?

539
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,072
Still being worked on.

540
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,835
Bertram, I'd like you to reconsider my offer.

541
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,115
You can join my practice
and I can guarantee you

542
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,156
an excellent starting salary.

543
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,996
Father, I don't want to be disrespectful...

544
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,752
Well, if not me, then what about Dr. Zinberg?

545
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,909
He said he'd meet with you.

546
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,798
He's a fine man at a very good hospital.

547
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,394
Well, I already have all of that at The Knick.

548
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,959
And there's something else there

549
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,430
that would make for a very rewarding life.

550
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,230
I'm in love with a girl there.

551
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,753
Really?

552
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,912
-Nurse Lucy Elkins.
-A nurse.

553
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,237
Yes, we've been out several times.

554
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,199
She understands the life of a physician
better than anyone.

555
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,430
In love.

556
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,272
Bertram, that is wonderful to hear.

557
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,715
I look forward to meeting the girl.

558
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,951
But if you wed,
she won't be a nurse much longer,

559
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,190
so you won't be able to use her as an excuse

560
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,793
to keep you tethered to The Knick.

561
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,872
My offer will be difficult to refuse.

562
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,236
I should head inside now.

563
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,199
Miss Mallon
has committed no crime.

564
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,039
She's been tried in no court

565
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,232
and has had no due process under the law.

566
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,472
On the word of a few crusaders,

567
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,915
she's been shut up in quarantine
in a tiny cabin

568
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,719
on North Brother Island against her will

569
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,877
with the sick and the dying and the diseased,

570
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,349
of which she's none of those things.

571
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,350
She wants her freedom.

572
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,313
And I'm here to make certain that she gets it.

573
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,194
Miss Mallon,
would you take the stand, please?

574
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,235
Place your hand here, please.

575
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,595
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,

576
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,830
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

577
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,957
-I do.
-I'd toss out that Bible if I were you.

578
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,231
-Your Honor.
-Inspector Speight, please.

579
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,634
Miss Mallon, can you tell me
how you came to be at this hearing today?

580
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,677
I was kidnapped.

581
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,360
Not for ransom, but I was attacked.

582
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,591
Taken from me job
and shut away by these awful people

583
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,636
who think I'm some sort of monster.

584
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,632
A devil. Those people.

585
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,280
Maligning me in the papers.

586
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,555
Calling me Typhoid Mary.

587
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,552
I didn't get no one sick
'cause I was never sick me-self.

588
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,234
Me lawyer, Mr. Bakerman,

589
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,392
told me all about that habeas corpus
you got in the law.

590
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,959
Produce a body, that says.

591
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,833
Well, here's me body.

592
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,310
And it's not got any disease.
I've never felt better.

593
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,356
Look at me. I'm in the pink.

594
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,591
No cough, no cold, no fever.

595
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,035
Sick people get sick.

596
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,837
Do I look sick to you?

597
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,196
Not a bit, Miss Mallon.

598
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,149
Hey, excuse me. Hey.

599
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,830
Two of you are fired.

600
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,351
Well, Which two?

601
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,998
You for insubordination.

602
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,435
So don't expect to be paid for the week.

603
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,875
We run a respectable business.

604
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,672
Thank you very much.

605
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,510
Your Honor, simply because Miss Mallon

606
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,192
isn't showing signs of the disease,

607
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,316
it doesn't mean that she doesn't have it

608
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,516
or that she can't give it to other people.

609
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,431
Her presence in
all of the homes and businesses

610
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,795
where the health inspector
found out that she had worked

611
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,878
produced at least 18 cases of typhoid fever

612
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,598
and several verified deaths.

613
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,910
- That's hogwash.
- Miss Mallon.

614
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,314
Dr. Chickering,
how many other documented cases

615
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,039
like Miss Mallon's with no symptoms?

616
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,513
Admittedly, Miss Mallon is
the first asymptomatic case

617
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,238
of a disease we've ever found.

618
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,036
We were previously unaware
that something like this could exist.

619
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,557
But, Your Honor, you must understand

620
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,710
that even though Miss Mallon feels fine,

621
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,598
she still carries the disease
for others to catch.

622
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,911
Her bowel movements
contained a pure culture of bacillus typhi.

623
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,198
She has the disease.

624
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,157
How many tests were done?

625
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,875
She has had one a week
for the last four months,

626
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,359
so that's 16 in total.

627
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,032
You should ask him
how many of those tests

628
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,633
didn't have the disease in them.

629
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,149
Miss Mallon, please.

630
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,038
How many, Dr. Chickering?

631
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,635
There were five instances where the disease
was not found in a sample.

632
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,274
Well, it makes one
wonder if it is your test

633
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,555
that might be ill and not Miss Mallon.

634
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,710
Though the fact that she has been
on North Brother Island

635
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,837
in close contact with so many
other patients with typhoid fever

636
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,038
and her health hasn't changed is more proof
for the fact that she has the disease,

637
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,116
but is impervious to its symptoms.

638
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,919
Perhaps it's proof of the opposite.

639
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:03,433
Perhaps Miss Mallon is
as healthy as a horse and simply immune.

640
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,080
And perhaps if you had gone to
medical school instead of law school,

641
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,276
you would have some idea
of what you were talking about.

642
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,479
You can step down now, Doctor.

643
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,915
It's times like this I wish I drank.

644
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,560
I'm sorry I lost my composure.

645
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,315
-It's not why we lost.
-The man is a fool.

646
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,476
It took 5,000 years for people to understand

647
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,516
that germs can make a body sick.

648
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,352
It's gonna take some time
for them to figure out

649
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,839
that they can exist and not.

650
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,558
Mmm. Sweet freedom!

651
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,953
-Go fuck yourselves.
-Go wash yourself.

652
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,799
At least your fucking hand
and your fetid ass when you take a shit,

653
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,394
so you don't kill someone
with your shit-filled cooking!

654
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,319
My apologies, Miss Robertson.

655
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,868
Oh! Don't apologize to me.
She's the filthy gash.

656
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,754
The gallery should take note that the abscess

657
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,759
is located

658
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,834
near the mental foramen.

659
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,310
I am going to curette the area

660
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,353
and possibly

661
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,595
remove some bone from the jaw.

662
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,356
There's quite
a bit of pus in there.

663
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,830
This tissue is hard as gristle.

664
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,509
Perhaps it makes more sense
to cut posteriorly...

665
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,312
No, this is fine.

666
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,758
It is critical not to puncture the mass
during the removal.

667
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,358
If the...

668
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,992
If the... What is it?

669
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,197
- It's the ray fungus.
- The ray fungus

670
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,350
is allowed to escape...

671
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,594
Thack, you all right?

672
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,551
Do you need assistance?

673
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,077
I have a bit of a headache.

674
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,517
Would you excuse me?

675
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,991
Where are you going?

676
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,832
Dowels, needle, and silk.

677
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,397
Nurse Elkins.

678
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,597
Nurse Elkins, dowels, needle,
and silk, please.

679
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,069
Quickly, thank you.

680
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,519
Hello?

681
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,074
Eleanor?

682
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,995
-What are you doing?
-It's cold.

683
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,672
I'm knitting a hat for Lillian.

684
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,638
Grace hasn't been changed all day.

685
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,438
Who hasn't?

686
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,438
Do you have references?

687
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,317
Oh, I certainly do, yes.

688
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,235
Is this your married name
on your application?

689
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,470
Yes, it's right there. Corinne La Mere.

690
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,154
Well, as long as it's not "La Mary,"
you should be fine.

691
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,753
I don't understand, ma'am.

692
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,432
Oh, I'm sorry.

693
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,511
There was an outbreak, a woman named Mary.

694
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,990
-It was in all the papers.
-Oh, I don't read the papers, ma'am.

695
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,355
Do you think you'll be able
to place me somewhere soon?

696
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,351
I miss the kitchen, and I could use a wage.

697
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,749
I'm sure I'll have no problem
finding you something good.

698
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,277
I Will add this to your bill.

699
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,712
If I'd have known you were gonna charge me,

700
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,156
I would have gone back to sleep
and let you choke.

701
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,390
I would not have died.

702
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,789
Nothing can kill me.

703
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,791
Of course not.

704
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,110
You're healing nicely.

705
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,229
I will not forget what you did for me.

706
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,359
You will always have a friend in Wu.

707
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,993
-I pack you a bowl, honey?
-Three.

708
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,595
Price is a lot now.

709
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,513
Wu making everyone pay first now,

710
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,631
even you.

711
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,234
Or no more opium from China.

712
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,595
-Lots of problems.
-But you have it?

713
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,915
Yes, still have.

714
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,438
-I lie with you, too?
-No.

715
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,350
I want to go out and stay out.

716
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,311
If I wake up,

717
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,873
you shove this pipe in my mouth

718
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,114
and you fire it up again and again and again.

719
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,749
You do want to wake up sometime,
right, Johnny?
