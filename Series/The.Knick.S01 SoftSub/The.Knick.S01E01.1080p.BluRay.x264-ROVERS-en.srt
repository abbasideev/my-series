1
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,789
Johnny?

2
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,392
Johnny, it's seven and a half.

3
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,916
You said seven and a half?

4
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,199
The Knick. North on Mott, east on 11th.

5
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,679
Bowery is faster, sir.

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,472
Won't have a long wait
for the trolleys crossing...

7
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,114
I don't want faster. I enjoy waiting.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,117
Mott north across Houston.

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,474
Yes, sir.

10
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,512
Please save my baby.

11
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,630
Gentlemen,

12
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,473
after two uneventful pregnancies,

13
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,757
Mrs. Warren presented in her eighth month

14
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,469
with what is assumed to be
a case of placenta previa.

15
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,838
The hope had been to delay any procedure
for the benefit of the fetus.

16
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,830
But circumstance has forced our hand.

17
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,513
Dr. Thackery and I have rehearsed
the newest techniques extensively

18
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,037
and feel confident
that the speed necessary for success

19
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,475
can finally be achieved.

20
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,833
Surgical knife.

21
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,673
One hundred seconds.

22
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,829
One hundred seconds.

23
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,519
I want the students to take note

24
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,878
that Dr. Christiansen is entering
on the medial line just above the pubis.

25
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,552
We must be careful
to extract the fetus quickly

26
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,392
and in such a manner
so as not to release pressure on the rupture,

27
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,028
thus exacerbating the hemorrhage.

28
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,317
As you can see,
there is significant blood in the cavity.

29
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,038
Vacuum, Everett.

30
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,715
Though it's difficult to see,

31
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,712
it seems the fetus has migrated

32
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,236
through the rupture upward
toward the abdomen.

33
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,915
We need to lengthen the incision
and get the baby out now.

34
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,075
Jules.

35
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,748
Nurse Monk, knife. Knife.

36
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,118
Bertie, cauterize.

37
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,279
Her pulse is weakening.

38
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,074
I have a leg.

39
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,196
-Pull the fetus down and out.
-lt's trapped in the cord.

40
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,430
Forceps clamps, umbilical scissors.

41
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,789
Bertie.

42
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,473
Come on, Thack.

43
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,914
Scissors.

44
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,671
- You're free.
- Tube it.

45
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,830
More vacuum, Chickering.
Put your back into it.

46
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,475
Her pulse has become eccentric.

47
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,835
We still have time. Clamp that artery.

48
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,149
Invert that section, Thack.

49
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,479
There's the bleed.

50
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,193
We can still close the rupture.
Warren's needle and gut.

51
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,355
Dowell's needle and silk.

52
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,509
Good.

53
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,078
Her pulse is faint and fully eccentric.

54
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,152
She's pallid and her lips are blue.

55
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,357
Pedals. One, two, three.

56
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,995
Almost.

57
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,749
Almost.

58
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,989
Almost.

59
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,035
There.

60
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,837
The bleeding stopped.

61
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,829
Nothing.

62
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,594
It seems...

63
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,753
It seems we are still lacking.

64
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,795
I hope, if nothing else,

65
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,235
this has been instructive for you all.

66
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,473
We'll solve it.

67
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,515
How many more, Thack?

68
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,315
"And many strokes, though with a little ax,

69
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,519
"hew down and fell
the hardest-timbered oak."

70
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,634
Thus spake Thack the Wise.

71
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,989
Jules.

72
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,954
The procedure failed. You didn't.

73
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,272
Thank you, my friend.

74
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,269
Fuck it all.

75
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,836
Your God always wins.

76
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,348
It is the longest unbeaten streak
in the history of the world.

77
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,480
Yet J.M. Christiansen fearlessly took up arms
in that battle to oppose the inevitable,

78
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,875
throwing himself at an enemy
that has never known defeat

79
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,912
and, as sure as I'm standing here, never will.

80
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,913
One could not be blamed for wondering

81
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,396
if J.M. came to see
his life's work as a fool's errand.

82
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,429
A rube

83
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,110
finally realizing
that the game he's been playing

84
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,838
will be forever rigged against him.

85
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,357
But my dear friend J.M. was a fine man
and certainly he was no fool or rube.

86
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,354
He and I spent our lives
tilting at the very same windmills.

87
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,953
So why have I not lost hope like he did?

88
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,359
Because those windmills
at which we tilted were created by men

89
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,592
to turn grindstones that transformed
the Earth's bounty into flour.

90
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,193
From such humble beginnings

91
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,437
grew the astonishing modern world
in which we now live.

92
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,593
We cannot conquer the mountains,

93
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,792
but our railroads now run
through them with ease.

94
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,794
We cannot defeat the river,

95
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,072
but we can bend it to our will
and darn it for our own purposes.

96
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,117
We now live in a time

97
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,911
of endless possibility.

98
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,672
More has been learned about the treatment
of the human body in the last five years

99
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,751
than was learned in the previous 500.

100
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,594
Twenty years ago, 39 was the number of years
a man could expect from his life.

101
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,671
Today, it is more than 47.

102
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,073
Eventually the train tunnels will crumble.

103
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,116
The dams will be overrun.

104
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,431
Our patients' hearts will all stop their beating.

105
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,957
But we humans can get in
a few good licks in battle before we surrender.

106
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,199
Catherine.

107
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,476
I will not stop pushing fonrard
into a hopeful future.

108
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,196
And with every blow I land,

109
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,994
every extra year I give to a patient,

110
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,358
I will remember my fallen friend
Jules Michael Christiansen.

111
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,952
And know that at the very least, something,

112
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,072
however temporary,

113
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,833
has been won.

114
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,833
-Lovely eulogy, Dr. Thackery.
-Thank you.

115
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,309
If not a bit self-aggrandizing.

116
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,837
And another chance for him to trumpet
his personal war against God.

117
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,879
Good afternoon, Miss Robertson. Sister.

118
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,274
Mr. Barrow.

119
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,829
It was a lovely funeral.

120
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,872
As these things go.

121
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,874
The minister was very eloquent, Sister.

122
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,429
Protestants have their moments, too.

123
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,039
Yes.

124
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,112
You should come to
one of our Sunday services, Sister.

125
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,798
Very God-fearing.

126
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,278
Good day to you both.

127
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,915
The whole event is just completely tragic

128
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,190
-and quite shocking.
-Hmm.

129
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,754
Who would have guessed
Dr. Christiansen was so hopelessly lost?

130
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,871
Twelve attempts
at the same surgery

131
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,872
with no survivors
would drive any good man mad.

132
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,279
Of course.

133
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,790
His anguish is over,
but hers is just beginning.

134
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,950
Though I understand
he left her a sizable sum.

135
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,957
Enough to keep a widow warm at night?

136
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,548
And to attract the right type of suitor.

137
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,995
She is still a handsome woman.

138
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,400
Always surprised by your sensitivity.

139
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,833
Thank you.

140
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,629
How were the proceedings, Sister?

141
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,433
I'm guessing
they chose to go closed casket today.

142
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,671
Yes, Mr. Cleary, the casket was closed today.

143
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,997
Ah, well, the worms
will be thankful for the extra holes, though.

144
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,997
Saves them from having
to make them for themselves.

145
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,912
Ah, Sister, don't judge me too harsh.

146
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,589
I'm just a poor simple sinner
in the eyes of the Lord.

147
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,353
The Lord loves all his children equally.

148
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,869
Though in your case, Mr. Cleary,

149
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,190
I'm sure he'll make an exception.

150
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,714
Ambulance.

151
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,995
Right.

152
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,679
We got one!

153
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,195
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Good afternoon.

154
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,315
Miss Telfer.

155
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,039
My father sends his regrets
that he can't be here today,

156
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,554
so I'll be sitting in as his proxy.

157
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,872
Signed by Captain Robertson.

158
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,594
Perhaps we should adjourn, then,
till the Captain can be here

159
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,472
-and we're able to do this properly.
-Yes.

160
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,393
If you strongly object to my father's wishes,
Mr. Habershorn,

161
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,354
l will understand if you need
to make your apologies and leave.

162
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,873
Then let's get to the business at hand.

163
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,118
I'd like to welcome Dr. Thackery
to his first board meeting,

164
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,470
seated in place of the late Dr. Christiansen.

165
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,795
My condolences, Dr. Thackery.

166
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,234
Dr. Christiansen's untimely passing

167
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,788
has brought added strain
to The Knickerbocker.

168
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,876
Aside from the public disaster it presents,

169
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,520
it further hampers
our efforts at financial solidity.

170
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,717
As you can see, gentlemen,
in the published reports in front of you,

171
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,195
monthly costs have increased.

172
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,717
This is due in part to the recent renovations
in the men's and women's wards.

173
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,118
The hospital is now running at a deficit
of nearly $30,000 a year.

174
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,673
Now, in light of this,

175
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,032
I've taken the liberty of postponing
the much-needed repairs in the courtyard.

176
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,875
Now, Dr. Thackery, as you were
Dr. Christiansen's Deputy Chief of Surgery,

177
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,270
We'd be grateful if you'd accept.

178
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,112
I will, though with great regret.

179
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,474
Which means you'll be needing a new deputy.

180
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,591
I'm sure we all agree that Dr. Gallinger
is the right man for the job.

181
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,955
I'm not sure we all agree on that.

182
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,918
My father and I would
like you to consider another candidate.

183
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,639
Based on what? Your surgical expertise?

184
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,756
Based on our faith in the man.

185
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,956
Dr. Algernon Edwards. Mr. Barrow.

186
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,950
He received his medical education at
Harvard College, graduating with distinction.

187
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,197
His training was done at Boston Hospital
and then Providence.

188
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,038
And he spent the past four years

189
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,152
working and instructing
at St. Thomas' Hospital in London

190
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,630
under Sir William MacCormac,
President of the Royal College of Surgeons,

191
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,633
and at the Institut Pasteur in France
under Albert Calmette.

192
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,076
He has more knowledge
of recent surgical advances in Europe

193
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,479
than any man in the country.

194
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,155
And his return to the States provides us
with a great opportunity, Thack.

195
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,156
Cornelia and her father have prevailed
upon him to travel to New York tomorrow,

196
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,549
as we assumed
you would want to meet with him.

197
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,756
He seems very qualified.

198
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,478
Then I shall arrange for him to meet with you.

199
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,709
Arrange or insist?

200
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,873
I think you can find a few minutes
for a candidate of this caliber.

201
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,636
Considering all
the Robertsons have done for us,

202
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,794
it would be foolish not to respect
their opinion and entertain the possibility.

203
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,593
Far be it for me to be foolish, Herman.

204
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,153
I will meet the man, but my choice is firm.

205
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,159
It's Gallinger.

206
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,634
Ah!

207
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,316
And a good day to you, Pete.

208
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,793
How you doing there, fella?

209
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,839
Got a nice little package there for us?

210
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,956
You're not getting this one, Cleary.

211
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,109
Oh, Pete.

212
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,713
Can't we be reasonable?

213
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,070
Talk about this like gentlemen?

214
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,389
Now, as to my mind,
you can either give us the goods

215
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,637
or youse can all
travel to The Knick as patients.

216
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,318
Hooked a fine one.

217
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,359
Banker from up Fifth Avenue.
Liver problems. Jaundice.

218
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,759
Pissing blood, he says.

219
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,993
I'm sure this one will be in a private with us
for a few weeks and be paying his bill in full.

220
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,038
-Nice catch.
-That's two more bits for Cleary.

221
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,792
End of the month.

222
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,238
Another beautiful day
at The Knick, Nurse Elkins?

223
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,635
Ma'am.

224
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,992
Dr. Gallinger.

225
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,435
This is Mr. Sebastiano Gentile, 40.

226
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,872
On the eighth of this month he was
struck by a streetcar, fracturing his pelvis.

227
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,396
Mr. Gentile, don't you know
never to quarrel with a streetcar?

228
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,909
I've never known a man to beat one yet.

229
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,433
I know that now.

230
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,994
Next time, take on
one of those horseless carriages.

231
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,712
Much better odds.

232
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,029
Upon arrival, an extensive wound
on the lateral side of his thigh

233
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,917
was immediately stitched and dressed.

234
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,112
Pulse was 112. Abdomen was tympanitic.

235
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,629
And there was tenderness
below the umbilicus.

236
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,275
So he was taken into the operating theater,
where we found four puncture wounds

237
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,237
from the fractured
pelvic bone lacerating the bowel.

238
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,072
And with Dr. Chickering assisting,

239
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,278
we immediately sutured the wounds
using three catgut sutures on each puncture.

240
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,751
Was there any consideration of removing
the damaged section of the bowel?

241
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,031
The difficulty in reconnecting the two
new ends of the intestines seemed too great,

242
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,270
and the danger
of postoperative bowel leakage

243
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,634
was another complication we discussed.

244
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,115
And I dared not risk a resection.

245
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,234
Any complications thus far?

246
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,039
Mr. Gentile has developed
a small case of bronchitis,

247
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,799
which is common after such a procedure.

248
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,158
Very good, Doctor.

249
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,835
Clogs.

250
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,156
Which nurse changed
the dressings on this man?

251
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,629
I did.

252
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,156
Per Dr. Gallinger's instructions.

253
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,318
Twice in the past 24 hours.

254
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,992
And I emptied his drains
throughout the night.

255
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,594
And did you recently empty that one?

256
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,834
I didn't.
It's tended to have collected very little fluid.

257
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,756
And yet the area
where the drain exits the wound is swollen.

258
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,112
Perhaps you might have considered clearing
the drainage tube of clogs.

259
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,435
How long have you been here?

260
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,874
Almost three weeks.

261
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,350
Then you should already know, Nurse Elkins,
that the goal is to keep the patients alive,

262
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,955
not kill them with negligence
after a surgeon's done his best to save them.

263
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,108
I expect everyone to be well-versed
in their responsibilities.

264
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,989
I'm sorry.

265
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,117
No, weakness and self-pity
have no place on my ward.

266
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,468
If I'm asking too much of you,

267
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,433
you can always take
the donkey cart back to Kentucky

268
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,028
and continue in the fine tradition
of curing people

269
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,429
with moonshine and angleworm poultices.

270
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,717
Rest up, Mr. Gentile.

271
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,236
You got a lot more
trolleys to dodge in your future.

272
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,878
The joke's on Thackery.

273
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,110
He doesn't know you're from West Virginia.

274
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,191
Jesus, Speight.

275
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,197
You sure it's not you
with the fucking tuberculosis?

276
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,072
Watch your mouth, Cleary.

277
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,630
There's plenty other
stretcher boys I can call for this.

278
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,358
Health inspector!

279
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,279
Health inspector. Open the door, please!

280
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,909
Hmm.

281
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,030
Mrs. Krawetz?

282
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,630
We're here to take you to the hospital.
Do you understand?

283
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,954
Hospital.

284
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,469
Hospital. She has a disease.
She must be taken out of here.

285
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,239
Christ alive,
it's the Tower of Babe! in these shitholes.

286
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,191
Never the same language twice.

287
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,594
Hospital!

288
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,029
My father says
he doesn't want you taking my mother.

289
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,633
Well, I'm Officer Sears
of the New York Police Department,

290
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,156
and there is a law that says we have to
take her someplace that'll make her well

291
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,593
so she doesn't get you sick, too.

292
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,556
My father says they took our neighbor
and he never came back.

293
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,116
Oh, she'll be back and fit as a fiddle.
You watch.

294
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,791
No windows, no ventilation,
no sunlight inside, no running water.

295
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,992
A breeding ground for disease.
That's why the new laws were passed.

296
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,993
I can compel you to make any and all
structural changes to your property

297
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,753
I deem necessary to protect the public.

298
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,196
That will cost a fortune.

299
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,838
I'm a businessman.

300
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,514
Blame Lister's microscope and Riis' camera.

301
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,195
The New York City Health Department
is just doing its job.

302
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,236
You own, uh, two more buildings
on this block, don't you?

303
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,835
Perhaps we can
come to some other arrangement.

304
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,433
Perhaps we can.

305
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,032
It's the last of the six loads.

306
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,396
Keep your boilers cooking
for the next four months.

307
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,909
- Three cents a pound?
- Sounds good.

308
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,039
Well, that is excellent, Mr. Corker.

309
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,279
Here is a bank draft from The Knickerbocker
for the full amount.

310
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,760
Thank you for choosing Parkhurst.

311
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,752
Mr. Parkhurst is grateful for your business.

312
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,357
And I am grateful for his.

313
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,232
Pardon me, gentlemen.

314
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,554
Where might I find Dr. John Thackery?

315
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,230
- Down there.
- Let's go, guys.

316
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,789
Come on.

317
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,475
-Dr. Thackery?
-Yes.

318
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,715
I was told I could find you here.

319
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,474
I'm Algernon Edwards.

320
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,472
Would you prefer for me
to wait in your office?

321
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,834
No, this is fine.

322
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,594
May I ask what it is you're making?

323
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,150
It's an idea for an improvement
on an instrument.

324
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,397
A colleague of mine in London
was very fond of smelting as well.

325
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,671
In fact, the harelip forceps he modified
is now the standard in Europe.

326
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,919
Well, if I find myself on the continent
working on a harelip,

327
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,036
I will know whom to thank.

328
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,599
I'm beginning to think you were not told
everything about me.

329
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,679
You envisioned something different,
I take it. Something lighter.

330
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,035
I did.

331
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,712
And to be frank, Dr. Edwards, I only agreed to
this meeting as a courtesy to Miss Robertson.

332
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,555
But I am certainly not interested
in an integrated hospital staff.

333
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,039
My skin color shouldn't matter.

334
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,958
Well, if it doesn't matter, then why
was that information held back from me?

335
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,992
You'll have to ask Miss Robertson.

336
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,435
It's also nowhere to be found
on your credentials.

337
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,872
Is your race listed on yours?

338
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,195
There's no need for it to be.

339
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,430
I grant that your background is impressive,

340
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,348
and I'm sure there are many Negro infirmaries
that will benefit from your talents,

341
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,192
-but this hospital...
-You're here.

342
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,430
This is where I'd like to be.

343
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,199
If you would just give me a chance.

344
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,194
In London and in Paris, I was treated
as an equal. And I have no doubt...

345
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,477
This is New York. This is not London or Paris.

346
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,359
You can only run away and join the circus
if the circus wants you.

347
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,790
I don't want you in my circus.

348
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,239
Dr. Edwards.

349
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,798
How was your meeting with Dr. Thackery?

350
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,391
Wonderful, if you call being humiliated
in front of a 1,000-degree furnace a meeting.

351
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,436
What do you mean?

352
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,235
Thank your father for me.
I'm going to head back to Boston.

353
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,436
Sorry if I wasted your time.

354
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,680
-I certainly wasted mine.
-Dr. Edwards.

355
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,719
Dr. Edwards.

356
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,474
Algernon.

357
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,279
Miss Robertson.

358
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,912
Dr. Chickering would like to see you.

359
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,955
-Inspector Speight.
-Mr. Barrow.

360
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,559
-How are things on the streets?
-Getting worse every day.

361
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,151
The more boatloads they let in,
the more pestilence infects the city.

362
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,840
I had three cases of tuberculosis just today.

363
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,469
The poor are just weaker than us.

364
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,951
You'd imagine the mayor would want to think
about sending them immigrants elsewhere,

365
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,031
but he don't stop 'em.

366
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,515
Shipping companies see to that.

367
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,517
Some of these diseases, they spread so quick,

368
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,995
they wipe out whole blocks of people
in just a few days.

369
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,629
We have to burn the bodies.
We have no place to put them.

370
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,634
-That a new one of your kids?
-Yes.

371
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,077
Handsome-looking family.

372
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,959
Always wanted to have
one of those done of me.

373
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,470
And why haven't you?

374
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,473
Don't think I could sit still that long.
What if I had to use the toilet?

375
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,913
Those frames look like they set you back a bit.

376
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,035
Gold leaf?

377
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,476
Where did you say you sent
these tuberculosis patients?

378
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,872
The Knick got one.

379
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,992
City's gonna cover the full freight cost
since I put her here.

380
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,195
And you want a finder's fee.

381
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,596
I could have easily sent her to St. Vincent's
or Presbyterian.

382
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,275
Next time could be none.

383
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,238
Or it might be all of them.

384
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,839
You know, I like you, Herm.
We're cut from the same cloth.

385
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,792
I like to think not.

386
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,992
It's not good.

387
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,949
The tuberculosis is pretty advanced.
Her lungs are completely full of fluid.

388
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,993
Fever of 104. Pulse is erratic.
Her fingers are clubbing.

389
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,157
Are you recommending a sanitarium stay?

390
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,238
She's already on the other side
of the hill, I'm afraid.

391
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,630
I honestly don't think
she'll make it through the week.

392
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,273
Does she know?

393
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,431
She doesn't speak English.

394
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,954
Her daughter has been interpreting for me.

395
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,911
I see.

396
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,630
Responsibility is to the patient,
but there's no rule that says we have to...

397
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,115
Hello.

398
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,239
May I ask your name?

399
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,073
-Yetta.
-Yetta. A beautiful name.

400
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,719
Yetta, my name is Miss Robertson.

401
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,037
I'm from the social welfare office
of the hospital.

402
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,229
I need your help right now
to explain something to your mother.

403
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,639
All right?

404
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,958
Please tell your mother that the doctor says
her disease has made her very sick.

405
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,631
But the hospital will do all it can
to make her as comfortable as possible.

406
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,518
Does she understand?

407
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,593
I'm so sorry.

408
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,919
It's 4:30.

409
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,431
Keller Shirtwaist Factory on Delancey.

410
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,312
Be sure she gets there safely, Jesse.

411
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,032
Yes, ma'am.

412
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,274
I expected you over an hour ago.
What kept you?

413
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,834
Your treatment of Dr. Edwards
was indefensible.

414
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,316
No, it was completely defensible.
I'll tell you exactly what I told him.

415
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,750
I'm not interested in leading the charge
in mixing the races.

416
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,792
Dr. Edwards is as capable as any doctor
in this hospital.

417
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,912
-Likely more so.
-Perhaps.

418
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,600
But just as a shopkeeper
would never stock an item on his shelves

419
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,352
no customer would buy,

420
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,916
I would not employ a surgeon
no patient will agree to have operate on them.

421
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,389
Then patients must be convinced
of his ability.

422
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,913
Are you going to stand there
and honestly tell me

423
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,959
that the way out of our financial troubles
is to hire a Negro surgeon?

424
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,913
Once people learn
that he is an excellent surgeon,

425
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,393
they'll change their minds.

426
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,272
We're speaking
about a patient's possible mortality.

427
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,278
Is this really a fair time
to begin a social crusade?

428
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,358
-Yes.
-We're an institution in dire condition.

429
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,877
We're not an incubator for some progressive
experiment for you and your father's money.

430
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,633
Please, find yourself another hobby.

431
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,115
-Got it?
-Yeah.

432
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,233
Do you see what you've done?

433
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,629
The Robertsons are pulling their crews.

434
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,836
They're terminating the electrification project.

435
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,115
Oh, so childish.

436
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,800
No, Thack, you're the child.

437
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,599
We need their money. We need to electrify.

438
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,312
I'm not hiring the Negro.

439
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,075
Do you think I want
that dusky coon roaming these halls?

440
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,230
A man of high rank on our staff
who will repel patients?

441
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,639
I need you happy,
but right now I need the Robertsons happier.

442
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,115
You know we have no choice.

443
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,071
The man will be hired.

444
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,432
Then I'll resign.

445
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,635
Again?

446
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,316
I want you to stay like that
for 20 minutes, Mrs. Eberhardt.

447
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,273
Nurse Connelly will keep
massaging your belly.

448
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,189
That breech baby will turn around in no time
to get away from the cold.

449
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,880
Is this something the doctor prescribed?

450
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,554
He would if he knew what he was doing.

451
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,715
Oh, I envy that cigarette.

452
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,836
Ah, the poor Lord's got all these ladies
married to him and none will give him a go.

453
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,989
Hey.

454
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,839
Do penguins ever just want
to go for a good poke?

455
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,311
Oh, we get curious.

456
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,312
But then they show us
a photograph of your sorry face

457
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,914
and we all run right back
into the arms of God.

458
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,036
Your ugly mug's responsible for more girls

459
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,879
staying virgins than the chastity belt.

460
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,468
How in God's name

461
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,438
are you still going?

462
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,950
I have an insatiable desire for fame.

463
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,152
And, of course, um,

464
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,118
my old friend,

465
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,599
Uncle Parker.

466
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,674
I'd love to have your help for this next part.

467
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,349
Unless, of course,
you'd rather go back to sleep.

468
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,475
His temperature is 105
and his pulse is rapid at 166.

469
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,313
He has vomited
three times in the last 90 minutes.

470
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,908
I figured his bronchitis was worsening,
so I summoned you.

471
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,514
It's not his bronchitis. It's septicemia.

472
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,428
The swelling of the limbs.
The discoloration has started, too.

473
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,479
My repair didn't hold. He's leaking
his own bowel poisons into his blood.

474
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,837
I should have resected.

475
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,869
It would have happened with any surgeon,
Thackery included.

476
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,550
Most of our patients
will receive their treatment here

477
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,878
in the men's ward.

478
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,595
Ah.

479
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,832
Allow me to introduce you
to two of your junior surgeons.

480
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,513
Good morning to you all.

481
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,438
Dr. Everett K. Gallinger
and Dr. Bertram Chickering Jr.

482
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,469
This is our new Assistant Chief Surgeon,
Dr. Algernon Edwards.

483
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,829
Thackery hired him?

484
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,998
Directed me
to do it as of late yesterday.

485
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,071
Everyone calls me Bertie.

486
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,509
Feel free yourself.

487
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,351
Welcome to our circus.

488
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,549
It seems we need to head back inside the tent.
Excuse me.

489
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,708
Septicemia following a bowel repair.

490
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,869
Mmm.

491
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,232
We need to go back in
and find the leak right away.

492
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,757
"We"? He is my patient, Doctor, not yours.

493
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,196
We can't go back in.
Bronchitis. The ether will kill him.

494
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,912
Get Dr. Thackery.

495
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,070
I don't believe he's come in yet.

496
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,720
Then find him, please.

497
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,274
Time is precious.
He's dying in front of our eyes.

498
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,469
Surely we can solve this ourselves?

499
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,516
-You'll solve nothing.
-Doctor.

500
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,154
He needs
an immediate resection.

501
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,191
Two slippery pieces of bowel, wet noodles
somehow sutured perfectly together

502
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,710
while septic fluids leak all over the cavity,
poisoning the patient.

503
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,116
That is if we are somehow able to bring about
surgical sleep without killing the man.

504
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,996
- Nurse Elkins.
- Yes?

505
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,390
Bertie and l will prepare
Mr. Gentile for the surgery.

506
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,351
I need you to find Dr. Thackery.
Try his home first.

507
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,630
We don't have a minute to spare.
Now, excuse me.

508
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,874
Lucy, do you know where he lives?

509
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,312
-No.
-28 Waverly.

510
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,994
Lucy, do you know where that is?

511
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,555
No.

512
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,029
West, then left on Wooster Street
towards Washington Square.

513
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,357
Welcome to The Knick.

514
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,473
Dr. Thackery?

515
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,073
Dr. Thackery?

516
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,073
Dr. Thackery?

517
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,676
Dr. Thackery,
you're urgently needed for a procedure.

518
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,437
Good Lord, Dr. Thackery.

519
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,714
Go away.

520
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,393
Please go away.

521
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,551
Dr. Gallinger sent me.

522
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,358
A patient is dying.

523
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,514
Which one?

524
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,755
Mr...

525
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,672
Um, Mr. Gentile.

526
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,392
He has septicemia.

527
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,118
Fucking Gallinger.

528
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,074
What's wrong with you? Are you sick?

529
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,433
I was trying to spend a night without it.

530
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,799
Without what?

531
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,950
Nurse, I need your assistance.

532
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,551
You need to inject me.

533
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,159
I can't do it.

534
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,074
Cocaine?

535
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,237
How much? I don't want to kill you.

536
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,112
A touch more than 22.

537
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,675
You've destroyed yourself, Doctor.
You're collapsed everywhere.

538
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,835
Toes.

539
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,476
-They're too small.
-Not for me. It's fine.

540
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,154
-I don't think I can.
-Oh, for God's sake.

541
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,357
-What are you doing?
-You want a bigger vein?

542
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,714
You want me to inject into your...

543
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,308
Yes, on the underside. The urethral.

544
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,079
Nurse.

545
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,035
Do it!

546
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,638
Lord forgive me.

547
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,556
Gentlemen, atomizers on.

548
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:39,670
Everyone scrubbed, washed,
cleansed, deloused, purified by God?

549
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,115
- All except the last, Thack.
- What's he doing here?

550
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,118
- You hired him.
- I'm here to assist in the surgery.

551
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,555
- He's not touching me.
- Don't worry, Mr. Gentile. He won't be.

552
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,240
Everett, you'll be assisting me.
Bertie, you'll back up Everett.

553
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,151
Thack,
we can't use ether on account of his lungs

554
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,798
and we can't operate on a man who's awake.

555
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,871
I know. I was considering this on the way in.

556
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,838
You could try Nirvanin on the abdomen.
There's been some success in Germany.

557
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,589
In dental surgery. For something like this,
it won't penetrate to the necessary depth.

558
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,950
Nurse Elkins,
would you prepare a spinal needle

559
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,629
and a hypodermic of 10
of a 2% cocaine solution?

560
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,518
Are you not familiar with the drug?

561
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,512
-I am.
-Then prepare it.

562
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,429
I didn't hire him. Barrow forced him upon me.
He's the new Assistant Chief.

563
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,397
I was told you had decided
to offer me the position.

564
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,708
Well, if Barrow told it to you,

565
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,434
you should know there is never likely
to be much truth in it.

566
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,474
l will not stay where I'm not wanted.

567
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,757
Then I'm guessing
you don't stay anywhere for very long.

568
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,078
As per my oath, I will remain in the theater
until the patient is out of danger.

569
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,832
And then I will resign.

570
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,629
Congratulations, Everett,
on your new promotion.

571
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,915
Mr. Gentile, we're going to sit you up.

572
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,389
-Everett, Bertie.
-Uh, what are we doing?

573
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,714
Sit him up.
Arch his back fonrard.

574
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,954
Nurse Monk, pencil, sponge with antiseptic.

575
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,798
Gentlemen, before you is a patient

576
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,990
who is infected with
septicemia from his bowel.

577
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,149
Normally, we would
induce surgical sleep with ether,

578
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,151
but due to a severe case of bronchitis he has

579
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,475
developed post-operatively, we cannot.

580
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,149
We must operate, but we cannot
do it to a man who can feel pain.

581
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,639
My solution.

582
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,470
Numb the nerves in the spine

583
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,074
between the thoracic vertebrae six and seven

584
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,237
so as to stop the brain
from learning of the pain.

585
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,238
I intend to inject a 2% cocaine solution

586
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,153
directly into Mr. Gentile's spinal canal.

587
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,999
Low enough not to affect the heart and lungs,

588
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,992
high enough to dull everything below.

589
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,749
My God, won't that paralyze him?

590
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,350
Not if he makes for the hollow canal
in the subarachnoid space.

591
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,233
It's been tried once before

592
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,711
on a Labrador retriever.

593
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,959
What happened?

594
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,676
There isn't a day goes by
where I don't miss that dog.

595
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,918
If you could attempt to suppress your cough.

596
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,231
Just a few seconds more.

597
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,076
Let's get him back down.

598
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,279
He's a madman.

599
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,436
"Though this is madness,

600
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,431
"yet there is method in it."

601
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,194
No pain.

602
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,874
Scalpel.

603
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,475
Gauze.

604
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,349
Towel.

605
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,631
Here's the location
of my repairs.

606
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,031
Your sutures failed in two spots

607
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,350
where the obstruction
backed up with pressure on them.

608
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,074
- You should have resected.
- I know that now. I'm sorry.

609
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,515
Dr. Edwards, before you resign
and leave us all in tears,

610
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,551
would you be kind enough
to go to the sterilizer

611
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,871
and pass me the metal device
contained within?

612
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,552
I'm now removing

613
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,189
approximately 12 inches
of the patient's intestines

614
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,920
to relieve a blockage and some damage.

615
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,269
From this day forth, Mr. Gentile,

616
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,315
you will have the honor
of evacuating your bowels

617
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,755
several seconds faster
than any of your friends.

618
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,437
Watch carefully, Bertie.

619
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,551
You're gonna want
to tell your father all about this.

620
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,312
After the bad section of the bowel is removed,

621
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,438
each new end of the intestine
can be clamped together into this device,

622
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:35,792
which allows it
to keep its tubular contour and shape.

623
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,598
I now tighten the screw
to bring the two new ends together.

624
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,870
And we're in good stead

625
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,910
for an easy connection

626
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,469
with sutures.

627
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,716
When I finish this, you close, Everett.

628
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,428
Nice knowing you, Doctor.

629
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:04,630
I'm not leaving this circus
until I learn everything you have to teach.

630
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,277
Chinatown. 467 Mott Street.

631
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,634
Yes, sir.
