1
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,716
The Chickering residence.

2
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,719
He's asleep.

3
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,315
Do you realize the hour, sir?

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,113
Hold the wire.

5
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,799
Bertram.

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,913
Bertram?

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,759
Yes, What is it?

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,274
- Telephone.
- What?

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,835
This is Bertie. Um, Bertram.

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,435
Yes.

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,676
Yes, Dr. Thackery.

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,193
I'll be right there.

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,589
And what did your esteemed chief
want so urgently?

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,910
- He needs me at the hospital.
- Now?

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,991
It had best be an emergency.

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,077
It's just some experiments.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,311
What kind of experiment
can't wait until the sun comes up?

18
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,790
- Dr. Thackery.
- Ah, Bertie. Good.

19
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,238
You're finally here. Scrub in.
We got a lot of work to do.

20
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,630
Introductions. This is Lin-Lin

21
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,030
and this wonderful creature is Delores.

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,839
There's no chance in hell that's her real name,
but it seems to suit her.

23
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,229
Now, I once met a Thai girl in the profession,
swore her name was Colette Bonaparte.

24
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,629
I suppose it's all
part of the transaction, you know?

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,792
She pretends, we pretend.
A good time is had by all.

26
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,110
How long have you been working in here?

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,639
What day is it?

28
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,438
Strictly speaking, it's Monday morning.

29
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,759
Two days.

30
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,595
All weekend without a break?

31
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,148
We took a few small breaks.

32
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,197
Doctor, I think you need some sleep.

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,191
Nonsense. If you please.

34
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,753
These ladies work by the hour

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,872
and their rate is on the high side
due to their cleanliness and good humor.

36
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,439
So scrub in, Bertie the Wise,

37
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,353
for I have many new secrets to reveal to you.

38
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,597
Believe then, if you please,
that I can do strange things.

39
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,075
So what did Christiansen do wrong?

40
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,435
Besides blow his brains out.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,989
I'm not sure what you mean.

42
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,595
All of those placenta previa cases
and the babies that he endeavored to save.

43
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,079
I pored over those papers

44
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,355
and there was nothing
that he did wrong surgically.

45
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,873
His problem was conceptual.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,639
You know, he believed that
the one variable he needed to change

47
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,039
was him getting faster,

48
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,669
but there was a second variable
he never even considered.

49
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,031
Come on, Bertie, you've got to think bigger.

50
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,031
You know, widen your mental scope.

51
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,236
Are you tired?
'Cause I can give you something for it.

52
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,790
What else could have changed
about the surgery?

53
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,555
The patient dying slower.

54
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,916
Precisely!
Bertie the Wise indeed.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,991
You know, it is such a shame that

56
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,992
your father doesn't share
your sort of curiosity.

57
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,548
That man seems to practice medicine in 1885.

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,200
But how could that be accomplished,
the patient dying more slowly?

59
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,077
Pressure on the tear in the womb.

60
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,879
To slow the bleeding. We tried that.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,673
A wrap around the woman's abdomen.
Pressing down on specific sites.

62
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,273
We even tried tight bandages
around the womb.

63
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,396
All attempted from outside of the organ.

64
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,393
I intend to put pressure
directly on the bleed in the womb

65
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,118
from the inside.

66
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,439
Right, but, okay,

67
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,193
short of crawling up in there,
I'm not sure that could be done.

68
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,439
The Lord knows we've all wanted to try that
at one time or another.

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,035
But in this case, we're just gonna have to
rely on pneumatics to do the job for us.

70
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,429
-You know what this is?
-A Champetier de Ribes balloon.

71
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,229
Correct. Used in the vaginal canal
to speed dilation.

72
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,954
-But I don't like it.
-Why not?

73
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,156
Because it's French and I didn't invent it.

74
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,312
And it's also the wrong shape
for our purposes.

75
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,555
Good old American basketball.

76
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,792
Much more preferable.

77
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,074
What is that?

78
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,515
This is something that I invented yesterday.

79
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,828
Or the day before.

80
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,516
It's a sheath that allows the bladder
to keep its correct shape for insertion.

81
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,790
You know, if a penis
can make the trip one way

82
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,791
and a baby the other...

83
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,108
Look, this is what we do.

84
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,670
We insert the basketball bladder bullet,
the BBB,

85
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,637
up into the vagina, up into the uterus,

86
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,188
and then we leave the air tube trailing
and remaining outside.

87
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,754
We then remove the sheath
so that the bladder can open.

88
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,478
We then attach a pump to the air tube

89
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,438
and we pump up the bladder
inside the woman

90
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,990
so that it expands
and hardens against the bleed.

91
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,278
We then add a weight to the tube
so that it puts pressure on the wound,

92
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,670
slowing the bleeding,
giving ourselves more time.

93
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,032
Brilliant. Does it work?

94
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,475
Well, I've been trying it on the girls
and we need more study.

95
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,835
That's why we're gonna spend
the rest of the night in here,

96
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,232
um, inserting these into our lady friends
and testing all variables.

97
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,594
Um, right. Well, they're not pregnant.

98
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,714
So there's gonna be a problem

99
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,473
with the difference of the size of the uterus

100
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,553
-as well as the lack of dilation of the cervix.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's all true.

101
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,518
But, you know, our budget
won't allow for pregnant prostitutes.

102
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,435
So we're just gonna have to make do
with what we see here.

103
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,599
Okay.

104
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,314
She looks better
this morning, more robust.

105
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,995
Look at her cheeks. They're pink.

106
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,037
That's a healthy pink.

107
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,869
Mrs. Gallinger,
I feel it's important to be candid with you.

108
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,396
Lillian's fever has gone up.
That's the pink you see.

109
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,512
She's not responding to light or sound.

110
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,716
Her fontanel's protruding further,

111
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,917
telling us she's got enormous brain swelling,
and it's increasing.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,399
She's going to get better.

113
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,839
We've all been praying for that

114
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,356
and you can't give up hope
your little girl will recover,

115
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,235
but you also need to know there's a chance
that the Lord will be calling Lillian home.

116
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,118
No. No.
Everett will think of something.

117
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,553
There's really almost nothing...

118
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,596
You brought this
into our house.

119
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,477
You admitted so yourself.

120
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,790
You have to fix this.

121
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,794
Do something for her, Everett.

122
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,831
Our daughter is dying.

123
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,992
Eleanor, please.

124
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,112
You said there was almost nothing.

125
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,714
That must mean there's something.

126
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,192
What is it, Everett?

127
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,278
Venesection.

128
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,518
What is that?

129
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,476
- Bleeding.
- It has very little chance.

130
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,551
I'll take any chance.

131
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,356
Chinatown. Mott Street.

132
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,909
So long.

133
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,837
Thank you, ladies.

134
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,672
You've been such a great help.

135
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,876
See you tonight, Johnny?

136
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,995
Possibly.

137
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,829
Could you tell Wu that
I'll settle my tab for your services then?

138
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,148
Mmm-hmm.

139
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,949
Bertie!

140
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,118
You know, I think I need to make
a few small modifications to the sheath.

141
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,077
It might be a tad snug. Did you sense that?

142
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,230
I had to use a little more force than I expected.

143
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,878
And those ladies aren't drums.

144
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,951
But the pressure on those
last few attempts felt correct.

145
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,396
I agree, but it's all just conjecture
until we get an actual previa patient.

146
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,553
I'm gonna have Sister Harriet
put out requests at the other hospitals.

147
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,916
Any chance we can give them
is better than what they're facing now.

148
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,676
You know, you might consider using water
instead of air for the bladders.

149
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,469
It'll add more weight and might
conform better to the patient's anatomy.

150
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,793
Brilliant.

151
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,512
Bertie, fine work today.

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,195
You're making great progress.

153
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,152
Near as we can tell,
the typhoid started at Elihu Brown’s house

154
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,391
eight months ago and moved to
the Cooke house on 5th a month later.

155
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,438
Next came the nine guests
at the Bedford Hotel.

156
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,636
Uh, then it started taking it
back to your circle again

157
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,119
at the home of Roger Conaughton's widow.

158
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,159
Two of her grandchildren went down with it
as well as a garden man and scullery maid,

159
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,117
who may or may not have been cavorting.

160
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,031
You saw the look on her face, Jacob.

161
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,156
Cavorting was the least those two were doing.

162
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,516
From the Conaughtons'
to the Abbott country home in Oyster Bay,

163
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,352
getting the young one and the father.

164
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,034
Next came Cora and Daniel Hemming.

165
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,192
How's the young girl doing?

166
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,555
There have been complications
and another surgery,

167
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,915
-but the disease seems to have run its course.
-Hmm.

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,989
After the Hemmings?

169
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,116
The VandenNerfs up in Riverdale got it.

170
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,679
And now the Selwyn Arms Restaurant.

171
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,557
That's at least 11 more right there.

172
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,959
So what's the link?

173
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,473
They got only one thing in common.

174
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,120
Something they all
seem to be enjoying these warm days.

175
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,391
-The ice cream?
-More like what's in the ice cream.

176
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,836
A peach. Or, specifically, peach melba.

177
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,276
And the woman who prepared it
for every one of those people who got sick...

178
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,635
- Mary Mallon.
- Mmm.

179
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,473
A lot of places to work in such a short time.

180
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,472
Well, families often hire
part-time cooks for a week here or there

181
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,199
and then on to the employ
of some other home or restaurant.

182
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,430
In this case, to infect more people.

183
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,671
She must be a filthy thing
and sick as a cod in a cesspool.

184
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,593
Believe me, no mistress would hire her
if she looked the least bit ill.

185
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,274
Well, that's a conundrum we can solve
when we get our hands on the cow.

186
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,430
We got to find her first.

187
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,308
Families like these
use only two agencies to find their help.

188
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,278
Mrs. Grover's for the new money
and Bigsby's for the old.

189
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,870
If she's working
for the wealthy in New York City,

190
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,315
she's been through
at least one of those doors.

191
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,278
Then we're gonna have
to go through them, too.

192
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,755
Where are you, Typhoid Mary?

193
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,352
Where did you say
this machine was originally?

194
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,192
The fellas at Johns Hopkins had it.

195
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,272
They've since found a better model,
so I took it off their hands,

196
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,918
which is fortunate for you.

197
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,434
-And it works fine?
-Like it was new.

198
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,830
My children were taking dozens of X-rays
of themselves on it the other day.

199
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,672
Had the thing running for hours.

200
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,512
No trouble at all.

201
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,114
Seem to be some nicks and dents.

202
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,079
Well, that's to be expected
from a secondhand piece.

203
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,991
If you don't take my word for it,

204
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,911
try it out for yourself.

205
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,519
Never had an X-ray made.

206
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,397
Well, what would you like to see?

207
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,869
Your hand? Rib cage perhaps?

208
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,194
My head.

209
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,039
Why not?

210
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,315
Step right over here.

211
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,311
There you go. Just right there.

212
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,032
Now, if you would, put that plate

213
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,792
up to your face.

214
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,393
Good.

215
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,630
Now, the trick is

216
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,233
to stay as still

217
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,675
as possible for the best results.

218
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,792
There.

219
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,155
This should take about an hour.

220
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,673
Very well done.

221
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,117
Now you'll always have a photo

222
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,671
to remember her by.

223
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,353
My condolences, ma'am, sir.

224
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,552
This looks like a very solitary way
to spend your lunch.

225
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,428
Are you coming or going?

226
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,715
Going. I'm meeting Inspector Speight

227
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,711
for some more interviews
about the typhoid cases.

228
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,835
Oh.

229
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,113
How's that going?

230
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,033
We think we may have found the source.

231
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,155
We?

232
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,839
Sounds intimate.

233
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,273
Algie.

234
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,636
I don't blame you.
He's ill-mannered, his clothes are stained,

235
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,957
and he always seems to have
some food hanging out of his mouth.

236
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,031
Every woman's dream.

237
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,236
You think Phillip will understand?

238
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,194
A gentleman knows when he's been bested
and must step aside.

239
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,592
How's my mother feeling?

240
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,240
You wouldn't have to ask
if you came to the house more often.

241
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,875
I know. I know. I've just been so busy here.

242
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,757
Well, she's fine.

243
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,270
In fact, she looks better than you.

244
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,316
Are you sleeping at all?

245
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,833
Not enough.

246
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,832
Working at The Knick all day

247
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,678
and researching at night.

248
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,955
I don't know how Thackery does it.

249
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,918
Where does his endless energy come from?

250
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,070
You know all about stamina.

251
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,311
All those contests you,
Henry and I used to have.

252
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,270
That time we tried to stand on the roof
on one foot the longest, see who would win.

253
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,634
Ah.

254
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,391
I was out there for only a minute
before I felt the slightest breeze and ran in.

255
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,110
Henry quit right after me,
but you, you stayed out there for hours.

256
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,310
-Mostly in the rain.
-Hmm.

257
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,755
The contest was over,
but you wouldn't budge.

258
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,036
I think you're tougher than you think you are.

259
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,079
Dedicating yourself
to The Knick is no ladies' tea party.

260
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,354
Perhaps.

261
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,117
I should be going.

262
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,757
It was good talking with you, Algie.

263
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,592
Anytime.

264
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,836
And say hello to your secret love.

265
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,520
I feel like I'm looking into my soul.

266
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,676
Let's talk about your price.

267
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,031
Well, new, a machine
like this could cost as much as...

268
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,116
3,000. I am aware.

269
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,474
But it is not new,

270
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,029
which is precisely why I called on you.

271
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,351
The hospital has limited funds.

272
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,671
Well, I could give it to you for 2,500.

273
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,036
I was thinking more in the range of 1,500.

274
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,078
It's not just the machine.

275
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,950
it's ordering the photographic plates.

276
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,238
And who knows how long
the uranium inside will last.

277
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,151
I'll meet you halfway.

278
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,593
2,000.

279
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,519
Well...

280
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,353
It is still more than I had hoped.

281
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,671
But we've gone long enough

282
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,193
without one.

283
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,675
So...

284
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,790
2,000 it is, Mr. Luff.

285
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,273
Wonderful.

286
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,395
-Is this the new machine?
-It is indeed.

287
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,152
Can we have a turn on it?

288
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,356
Be my guests, ladies.

289
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,112
- How does it work?
- Allow me.

290
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,078
All right, closer.

291
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,230
Closer. Closer.

292
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,709
Not that close!

293
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,915
All right, here we go.

294
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,710
So it's rest and healing for several weeks

295
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,519
until the flap fully attaches.

296
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,591
And no vigorous movement.

297
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,113
Sadly, I haven't had occasion

298
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,919
for vigorous movement in quite some time.

299
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,872
Oh, come now, John.

300
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,036
I won't pretend that this
isn't absolutely ridiculous.

301
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,596
So, uh, I'll see you back here soon

302
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,440
and we'll finish the job.

303
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,839
Let's get you a cab.

304
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,593
I prefer to walk.

305
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,875
-Really?
-Of course.

306
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,678
It's a lovely day.

307
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,113
Well, it was looking like rain.

308
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,349
Yeah.

309
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,873
It always looks like rain

310
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,235
if you only look at the clouds.

311
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,833
Don't look at the clouds so much, John.

312
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,549
So you will let me
know if you receive a previa case?

313
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,752
Thank you, Dr. Rasmussen.
That is appreciated.

314
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,432
Good day.

315
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,835
-Dr. Thackery.
-Mr. Luff.

316
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,479
So what will you be attempting
to sell me today?

317
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,109
I have all the surgical supplies I need.

318
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,512
I was actually hoping to interest you
in doing a little selling of your own.

319
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,319
Who are the new heroes in America?
Sousa and Joplin?

320
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,114
President McKinley? Cap Anson?

321
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,189
No longer.

322
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,556
People now believe passionately in the
men who will bring them miracles.

323
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,356
Doctors, inventors, architects.
These are the new American gods.

324
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,829
Edison, Halsted, and Roebling.

325
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,077
Technology and innovation
will be the world's salvation

326
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,479
and the people know it.

327
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,198
They crave what's coming next.

328
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,113
And their faith... Ah, their faith is bottomless.

329
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,350
And you mean to exploit that faith.

330
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,717
No, I mean to give them the solutions
that they're looking for.

331
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,110
We are the supplier
of the finest medical products in the world.

332
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,079
We want to be the maker
of the best medicines and elixirs as well.

333
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,510
And with your help, we think we can be.

334
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,398
You want me to invent medicines for you?

335
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,155
That's not my field of expertise.

336
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,549
No need. The medicine's already been crafted.

337
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,314
Dr. Thackery's Rejuvenation Liniment.

338
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,391
Rub it on your trouble spots thrice daily,

339
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,790
your malady will disappear.

340
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,553
Look, that's your picture right there.

341
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,676
We're gonna run articles and advertising

342
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,318
in newspapers around the country.

343
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,029
Even send you to the Paris Exposition
this summer.

344
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,793
"Dr. Thackery's Rejuvenation Liniment

00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,270
"heart lameness, leg swellings,
and cataracts."

350
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,309
Is that all?

351
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,436
Those are very real claims.

352
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,352
Well, then perhaps you won't mind telling me

353
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,591
the ingredients that make up
this miracle potion.

354
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,310
Let's not be coy with each other, Doctor.

355
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,030
This is a booming market.

356
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,951
We want our share of it.

357
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,117
Last year Dr. Ayers' Pectoral Plaster,

358
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,272
Brown's Bronchial Troches,
Dr. Corbett's Brain Food,

359
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,311
and Dr. Wordsley's Female Pills

360
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,631
accounted for $5 million in sales.

361
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,391
Dr. Pepper's brain tonic is doing so well,

362
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,391
they're serving it at fountains
all around the city.

363
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,153
As much a beverage as it is a remedy.

364
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,075
You are one of the most
respected physicians in the nation.

365
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,391
And with our help, we think we can
make you one of the richest as well.

366
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,034
And all I have to do is loan you my name?

367
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,235
Precisely.

368
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,278
The money will roll in by the shovelful.

369
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,237
You'll be one of the most
famous men in America.

370
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,348
Nothing, nothing will be beyond your reach.

371
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,836
Can you give me some time to think about it?

372
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,594
Absolutely. How much time do you need?

373
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,995
Until hell freezes over.

374
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:07,030
In the meantime, would you be so kind
as to stick your head firmly up your ass?

375
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,915
Away, you moldy rogue.

376
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,439
Away.

377
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,039
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

378
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,951
Thank you.

379
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,393
If you'd like five or six more,

380
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,789
we can just keep making circles of the park.

381
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,676
Making believe we've never met the vendor
every time we come 'round.

382
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,591
How much are your pretzels, sir?

383
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,796
Really? Well, then I'll try one.

384
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,630
So, how are you enjoying the hospital so far?

385
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,359
It's been seven weeks.

386
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,868
You've been counting?

387
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,317
Well, the place did get a bit rosier
when you arrived.

388
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,716
Do you say that to all the new nurses?

389
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,911
No, of course not.

390
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,238
I was only teasing.

391
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,398
I know you wouldn't do that.

392
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,877
Because I wouldn't.

393
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,318
My mother says
the first time you meet someone,

394
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,433
in that moment, you can know their soul.

395
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,599
I wish I knew that when we first met.

396
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,277
You were helping an edema patient into bed.

397
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,915
Oh.

398
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,912
So you remember the first time you saw me?

399
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,434
Don't go getting full of yourself.

400
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,511
I also remember
the first time I saw Mr. Pouncey

401
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,511
and he was picking at his ear with a twig.

402
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,954
I'm not sure it's true you can know someone
from the first moment,

403
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,113
but maybe you can get to know them
from some other moment.

404
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,313
Even the hardest people can surprise you.

405
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,274
That's where Dr. Thackery lives.

406
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,674
I know.

407
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,359
It's nicer inside than you might think.

408
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,797
Have you been inside?

409
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,233
When you had me fetch him
for the bowel repair.

410
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,271
Right. Right.

411
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,558
The evening of Mr. Gentile's
miraculous nerve block.

412
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,473
He had me inside while he readied himself.

413
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,077
That was quite a day.

414
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,957
It certainly was.

415
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,113
There's no one like Thackery.

416
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,668
No, there isn't.

417
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,878
I tried to explain it to my father

418
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,797
and he just scoffs.

419
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,159
He wants me to join his practice at Columbia.

420
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,277
But why would I do that

421
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,797
when I could be watching the man
invent the future right in front of me?

422
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,229
To work so closely
with a surgeon of his genius,

423
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,715
-it's...
-Intoxicating?

424
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,675
Yeah.

425
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,714
It means a lot to me that you understand.

426
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,909
I do.

427
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,073
I just realized I don't even like pretzels.

428
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,033
I, uh...

429
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,439
I don't know why I bought that.

430
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,117
Best not fix on going toe-to-toe
with the Big Nig.

431
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,438
He ain't no free swinger.

432
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,478
A fella your size can get inside and surprise.

433
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,480
The man's trained. Professional-like.

434
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,994
Knocked out Jake Kilrain in five.

435
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,197
Floored "Mexican" Pete Everett seven times
before they stopped it.

436
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,996
And took Tom Sharkey all the way
to the bloodiest draw I ever saw.

437
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,311
The Big Nig will kill a man like you
in that alley

438
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,351
and never break a sweat.

439
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,308
...Thursday, then I might be too late.
You know?

440
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,349
Hey!

441
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,429
What?

442
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,830
My deepest sympathies to you both.

443
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,672
Thank you, Sister.

444
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,951
I can only imagine
the tremendous pain in your hearts right now.

445
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,878
God knows your suffering.

446
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,515
I hope you know He's here with you.

447
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,670
She's going to get better.

448
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,674
Who, dear?

449
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,988
Lillian.

450
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,476
God will bring her back to us.

451
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,834
Eleanor.

452
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,750
You'll say a prayer, Sister?

453
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,719
A prayer for Lillian's return to health?

454
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,672
Of course.

455
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,711
Dr. Gallinger,
may I have a word with you for a moment?

456
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,359
Of course.

457
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,872
She won't accept it.

458
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,677
She even prepared breakfast
for Lillian this morning.

459
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,513
It's not uncommon.

460
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,034
Once you place Lillian in the ground,

461
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,439
I don't envy the powerful wave of melancholia
that will engulf this house.

462
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,555
Perhaps there might be a solution
to help ease your loss.

463
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,959
What is it?

464
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,516
Recently a very young baby, a girl,

465
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,795
was found on the doorstep of the orphanage.

466
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,549
I understand my impertinence,

467
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,234
but I've seen many a grieving mother.

468
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,758
Death takes not only the soul of the child,

469
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,317
but can destroy the souls
of those left behind.

470
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,959
If Eleanor can hold a baby, nurture it,

471
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,358
you can begin to find your way again to heal.

472
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,439
All I ask is that you consider it.

473
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,271
What are you doing here?

474
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,476
We have business to tend to.

475
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,554
-May I help you?
-Inspector Speight, Department of Health.

476
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,830
We were told by Grover's
Domestic Placement Agency

477
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,195
that a cook named Mary Mallon
is currently in your employ.

478
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,078
-That true?
-Oh, I don't know any of the help by name.

479
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,358
Of course not, but we'd like to
come in ourselves and meet your staff.

480
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,671
Of course. The cook is right inside.
We're just sitting down for lunch.

481
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,113
You're more than welcome to join us.

482
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,916
I'd feel safer biting into a bag of horse shit
than eating anything that twat made.

483
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,199
Looks like we found her. Mary Mallon?

484
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,629
Who's asking?

485
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,199
Inspector Speight
of the Health Department.

486
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,396
This is Miss Robertson of the Knickerbocker.

487
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,516
-Officer Phineas Sears.
-Well, this ain't me kitchen.

488
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,033
I was just hired on in the last days.

489
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,394
You need to speak with Miss Nisbet.

490
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,789
Actually, we need to speak with you,
Miss Mallon.

491
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,029
What's your business?

492
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,799
Are you the Mary Mallon who
was employed at the Hemming residence?

493
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,234
-Yeah.
-And prior to that,

494
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,993
did you work at
the Abbott's country home in Oyster Bay,

495
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,834
Elihu Brown's, the Haldemans',
the Bedford Hotel, and the Selwyn Arms?

496
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,433
What of it?

497
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,228
We believe, Miss Mallon,
that you may have infected

498
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,788
those families and others with typhoid fever.

499
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,275
Typhoid?

500
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,669
Well, you're loony. Do I look sick to you?

501
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,957
- No, however...
- However we've got at least a dozen infected,

502
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,429
many of them have already
gone to Abraham's bosom.

503
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,990
The one thing they got in common,
your filthy mitts.

504
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,071
Now, we need you to come
with us to The Knick

505
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,799
and give us your urine,
saliva and feces for testing.

506
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,598
I ain't going anywhere with you people.

507
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,631
I'm working and these boys need to eat.

508
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,029
Not what you're cooking.
This ain't an invitation.

509
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,795
You don't want to come,
Officer Sears and me can force you to comply.

510
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,997
Come now, lady.
Let's make this easy for all of us.

511
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,511
You want me saliva?

512
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,795
There!
Now the other two ain't gonna come so easy.

513
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,438
Grab the bitch!

514
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,948
- Get off of me! Get off of me!
- Stop her!

515
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,399
Can't you see I'm not sick,
you stupid woman?

516
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,549
Shut up!

517
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,756
Get the fuck off of me for fuck's sake!

518
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,308
-Shut your filthy mouth.
-Get off of me!

519
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,392
Jesus Christ!

520
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,790
I never seen a society girl
join the fracas that quick.

521
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,951
Definitely a new century.

522
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,309
Huh.

523
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,713
This is quinine. A teaspoon every four hours.

524
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,519
If she develops any pain in her lower region,

525
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,239
have her douche with creolin solution.

526
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,430
I'll make sure and check on her
in the next few days.

527
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,872
Bless you.

528
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,990
I don't know what we would do.

529
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,115
That'll be $8 for today, ma'am.

530
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,070
I can look toward
to a poor night of rest again.

531
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,475
Well, perhaps you need a fella by your side.

532
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,391
Stay out of that habit
for an hour or two longer,

533
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,879
you shall have no delay in finding him.

534
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,318
All right, Harry,
what's behind the sleeping trouble?

535
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,072
Half of the time I lay in bed

536
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,550
convincing myself
that what I'm doing is right by everyone.

537
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,236
Like that girl up there just now,
her floor boss forcing himself on her.

538
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,752
I'm guessing it's the other half
of the time that's the trouble.

539
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,832
That's when I lay there wondering
if I'm already dead.

540
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,399
Fate sealed.

541
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,875
And whatever good
I think I might do won't save me.

542
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,473
See? That.

543
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,870
That's the part that helps me sleep the best.

544
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,958
If I'm going to the furnace, I'm going.

545
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,033
Besides, can't be worse

546
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,599
than the place I come from.

547
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,591
Where was that?

548
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,319
St. Joseph's Orphan Home
in Enniskean.

549
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,797
The nuns were wicked cuntiballs.

550
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,513
Nothing like the house you run at The Knick.

551
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,991
These sisters, they were happy
to whale on you all the day long.

552
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,869
Hmm.

553
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,273
What's that say?

554
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,990
It's chicken scratch. Hmm?

555
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,475
Compliments of Sister Clarice.

556
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,838
She'd whale on my left hand with
a 3-foot dowel every time I tried to use it.

557
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,512
Forced me to use my right.

558
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,990
Taught me left-handed were wicked,
sinister-like.

559
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,550
She'd whack me,
giving it out till I puked myself.

560
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,113
A couple of years of that will turn you against
them evil goats, God, the whole thing.

561
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,395
You can't paint us all with that brush, Cleary.

562
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,393
I serve God my way.
I do His work and remain true to His cause.

563
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,230
Except for the abortions and all.

564
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,914
-I meant...
-I know what you meant.

565
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,796
And I know you ain't them.

566
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,318
I don't know much,

567
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,194
but I would wager that God
will put you far ahead of Sister Clarice

568
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,591
when it comes to passing
through the pearly gates.

569
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,199
She'll have one.

570
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,032
How long have you been bleeding?

571
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,077
On and off for the last few months.

572
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,230
And this didn't occur
with your previous pregnancies?

573
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,949
Not with any of the other five.

574
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,998
Is there a problem?

575
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,159
Your lower uterine wall has thickened.

576
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,113
And that, I'm afraid,
is your placenta out of place.

577
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,715
-Should I call for the surgeons?
-Yes.

578
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,872
Someone else.

579
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,230
Dr. Thackery. Bellevue just called.

580
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,234
We got one. It's coming in right now.

581
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,913
Ready?

582
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,991
Equipment is aseptic and ready for use.

583
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,711
Are you sure we're ready?

584
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,552
Having doubts?

585
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,279
It's to be expected.

586
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,753
Not from me.

587
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,270
How can you be so certain?

588
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,234
Perhaps a few more trials with

589
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,356
the female subjects.

590
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,317
I could help pay for their time.

591
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,197
I miss them, too.

592
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,795
They are more proof of God than
anything else I've ever seen on this Earth,

593
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,559
but their usefulness to us, at least medically,

594
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,199
has passed.

595
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,831
What you choose to do with them
on your own time is entirely up to you.

596
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,911
Dr. Chickering is now inserting
the deflated bladder,

597
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,552
which is sheathed to keep the shape small
while entering the vaginal canal.

598
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,958
We are now entering the uterus.

599
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,712
With this new procedure,

600
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,268
there is no danger of exsanguination,

601
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,636
as our bladder has slowed
the bleeding to a trickle.

602
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,119
Retractors.

603
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,593
The baby is alive.

604
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,754
The patient will live to mother it.

605
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,313
Gentlemen,

606
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,397
I give you the Christiansen-

607
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,948
Thackery-Chickering

608
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,432
Placental Repair.

609
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,354
Bertie.

610
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,356
To Dr. Jules Christiansen,

611
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,717
who deserves to be here with us.

612
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,356
-Is the paper finished?
-Almost.

613
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,114
I left some of my notes in the lab.

614
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,790
-Should I fetch them?
-No,no,no,ngo.

615
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,711
You should go home, get some rest.

616
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,515
Have breakfast with your father

617
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,194
and tell him all about
how you'll soon be a published surgeon.

618
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,712
-Good night, Doctor.
-Night, Bertie.

619
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,637
What the hell is this?

620
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,951
...how long the wax has
been impacted in there.

621
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,635
But that sodium bicarbonate solution
should help loosen...

622
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,876
-What are you doing here?
-What am I doing here?

623
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,556
I sincerely hope I'm in a state of delirium,
because this cannot be what it appears.

624
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,078
-Get them out of here.
-Just let me...

625
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,798
Out, Edwards, now!

626
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,998
This way.

627
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,673
The unbelievable brass on you
to think you can run a clinic

628
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,150
for Negroes in my hospital
like some goddamn underground railroad.

629
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,632
Full disclosure?

630
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,838
It is much, much more than just a clinic.

631
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,798
What do you mean?

632
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,469
Have you lost your fucking mind?

633
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,599
These people needed help
and I needed to do it.

634
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,389
This goes beyond disobedience
into outright negligence.

635
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,199
I was never anything of the sort.

636
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,033
Stolen equipment, unregistered patients,

637
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,840
procedures performed in unsterile conditions

638
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,916
with unqualified people.

639
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,637
I hope you don't believe that your association

640
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,951
with the Robertsons will
save you from termination.

641
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,755
What was I supposed to do?

642
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,195
Huh?

643
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,110
Wait around for you
to allow me into your lily-white theater?

644
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,674
You are a man of science.

645
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,194
Show me, show me any proof

646
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,158
that says that I should not be allowed
to work alongside you as an equal.

647
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,994
This is not about a disparity
between the ability of blacks and whites.

648
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,311
This is about lies. It's about duplicity.

649
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,351
This is about your lack of morality.

650
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,509
Morality?

651
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,471
Morality from a man whose own morality

652
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,672
allows sick and desperate people
to be turned away,

653
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,195
because he believes them
to be less human than he.

654
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,475
Edwards, you are finished.

655
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,791
These people cannot stay here.
You find them another place to go.

656
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,634
Yes, sir.

657
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,633
What is this?

658
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,957
It's for suctioning.

659
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,914
No cranking?

660
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,309
No. Frees up a hand.

661
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,317
Did you invent this?

662
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,518
Modified it from an existing product.

663
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,996
That's not the only thing
I've come up with down here.

664
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,116
My solution for the inguinal hernia.

665
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,877
I then separate the cord from the sac

666
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,918
and continue for one-half inch
around the inside of the interior ring.

667
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,669
And what happens if you find
that the hernia is congenital?

668
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,077
I separate a strip from the back,
the bottom of the sac from the rest,

669
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,835
and catch the cord and the testicle
using a continuous silver suture.

670
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,872
-Silver?
-It has incredible holding power.

671
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,629
Where'd you find silver suture?

672
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,710
Another item I had modified.

673
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,119
How many hernia patients have you seen?

674
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,916
They're not hard to find,

675
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,596
considering most of the jobs
colored folks can get involve heavy lifting.

676
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,797
How many have you lost?

677
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,509
-One.
-One?

678
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,589
Mmm-hmm.

679
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,559
And solely because
he disregarded my instructions

680
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,108
to refrain from strenuous activity.

681
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,439
Did you come up
with the idea for this booklet as well?

682
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,717
I did. It was easier than relying
on my staff down here to take all my notes.

683
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,358
-Where'd you get the camera?
-I bought it,

684
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,556
like most of what you see down here.

685
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,358
One of the reasons
I'm still living at that hotel.

686
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,351
My salary got diverted.

687
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,877
You endangered
your entire career with this stunt.

688
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,678
What if it wasn't me
that stumbled across you?

689
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,552
What if it was Barrow or Gallinger?

690
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,428
Right, because you were so charitable
when you discovered me.

691
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,712
I never planned on this going as far as it has.

692
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,677
It started with me wanting
to help one or two people.

693
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,273
And once the discoveries began, it...

694
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,716
You had to see it all the way through.
I understand.

695
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,631
You know, this is good.

696
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,871
This is better than good.

697
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,110
So where do we go from here?

698
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,358
Well, all of this ends.

699
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,074
But not until these people are fully recovered.

700
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,312
And until then, I should be able to
treat my other patients as well.

701
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,555
You just make sure you keep that door locked
so that no one else stumbles in here.

702
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,391
What about my findings?

703
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,992
Well, I think we'll be making that
the new standard hernia procedure.

704
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,389
Well, if it's the standard here,

705
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,356
shouldn't it be the standard everywhere?

706
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,834
Meaning you want this to be published?

707
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,230
I could never get published in this country
on my own.

708
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,390
But if I had a co-author...

709
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,350
Oh! You want me to co-author
with you on this?

710
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,876
As lead or as equals?

711
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,757
As long as it gets my name out there,
I don't care what my accreditation is.

712
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,632
And one more thing.

713
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,473
I think it's time I be allowed

714
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,472
to work with you officially in the theater

715
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,189
as your deputy chief of surgery.

716
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,553
I don't want you just to get me
when you can't find someone else.

717
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,878
And if I don't allow you?

718
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,235
Then I'll take my future discoveries elsewhere.

719
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,796
And you will miss out on all the fun.

720
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,954
Dr. Edwards.

721
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,155
Hmm.

722
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,998
May I officially welcome you to The Knick?

723
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,074
Cards.

724
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,718
That's a nice one. And that is a nice one.

725
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,993
Good evening, gentlemen.

726
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,229
Neely.

727
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,232
Come to bring your dad some good luck?
Hobart's taken all your inheritance.

728
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,673
Is that true, Mr. Showalter?

729
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,193
Perhaps just dented it a bit.

730
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,510
You'll get it all back
when you and Phillip are married.

731
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,589
Is that an incentive

732
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,477
for me to keep losing to you?

733
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:29,348
Just look at me as a conveyer of your wealth
to my future daughter-in-law.

734
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,829
If you don't mind,
I'd prefer to cut out the middleman

735
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,353
for the next few hands.

736
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,674
And how are you doing?

737
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,193
Will we begin our marriage penniless?

738
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,635
No, only down a bit,
but to my father and yours,

739
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,597
so we'll likely see it again.

740
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,638
Mmm. How's The Knick?
You still on the hunt?

741
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,235
Oh, Cornelia's been playing a bit of detective
alongside a health inspector.

742
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,992
We got our girl today.

743
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,038
Inspector Speight and I apprehended
the suspect this afternoon.

744
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,270
Apprehended? Listen to my girl.

745
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,874
She sounds like Big Bill Devery
down at police headquarters.

746
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,632
You think she can be bought as easily?

747
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,032
It was exciting, Phillip,

748
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,238
to get out into the street and do some good.

749
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,678
I don't know.
It was wonderful to feel so useful.

750
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,877
What's wonderful is to see
such a flush in your cheeks.

751
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,712
Congratulations, Neely.

752
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,633
An epidemic has been
averted because of you.

753
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,392
-Yes.
-A toast to my little girl.

754
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,152
I agree. To you, my love.

755
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,396
Perfect way to wind down
your tenure at The Knick.

756
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,790
My wife will always have the best stories
to tell her lady friends at lunch.

757
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,156
Well, thank you all.

758
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,432
It's been a long day.

759
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,360
-Good evening.
-Sweet dreams, dear.

760
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,511
Phillip, it's to you.

761
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,271
- 100.
- Oh!

762
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,997
Come in, Gertrude.

763
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,916
My dress is ready to be hung.

764
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,155
Mr. Showalter?

765
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,708
Dear, I've known you since you were born.

766
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,756
You're going to be my daughter.

767
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,797
Why don't you start calling me Dad?

768
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,873
I don't think your own father
would mind too terribly much,

769
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,188
do you?

770
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,239
Very well.

771
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,156
I always wanted a daughter.

772
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,030
We lost two in childbirth.

773
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,359
I'm sorry.

774
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,634
But now I have one of my very own.

775
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,197
I suppose that's true.

776
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,232
Phillip has given us a beautiful,

777
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,757
beautiful daughter in you.

778
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,589
I've invested a tremendous
amount of money with your father.

779
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,118
I believe in the union of our two families.

780
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,839
I know he's grateful...

781
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,672
I don't want his gratitude.

782
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,830
I did it because I believe our coming together

783
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,195
is a wonderful thing that will provide

784
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,748
rewards and pleasures for all of us.

785
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,558
Do you think it's a wonderful thing, Neely?

786
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,551
Of course, Mr. Showalter.

787
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,829
Dad.

788
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,756
Open or closed?

789
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,548
What?

790
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,757
The door. Open or closed?

791
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,994
Closed.

792
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,953
Sleep tight.
