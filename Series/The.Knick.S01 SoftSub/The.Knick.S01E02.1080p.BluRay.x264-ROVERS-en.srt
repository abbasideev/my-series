1
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,878
-Good morning, miss.
-Good morning.

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,639
It seems someone
called the Marquesa de Salobreﬁa

3
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,312
is coming in for the opening of the season.

4
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,558
"Salobreﬁa," dear.

5
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,757
The squiggly mark, it makes a noise.

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,278
So much young European royalty
in New York these days.

7
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,596
They call our money new.

8
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,319
But it certainly does attract a crowd.

9
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,277
Sure are some nice shoes.

10
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,351
Thank you.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,673
Some kind of fancy leather.

12
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,079
Must have cost you heavy.

13
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,350
Everything moving forward
with the electrification

14
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,989
now that Thackery has seen the light?

15
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,512
Well, the crews finished the installation

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,192
on the operating theater and the wards.

17
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,355
Oh.

18
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,035
We're now a modern hospital.

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,352
The board must be pleased.

20
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,199
Aren't they?

21
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,153
Where you get a pair of shoes like that?

22
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,358
At a store.

23
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,192
Which one?

24
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,470
Maybe I get me a pair like that.

25
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,394
It's not a very fair position to
put a young woman in, August.

26
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,959
I'm sure Cornelia's only doing it

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,712
because she can't say no to you.

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,633
I actually like it. I just...

29
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,359
I wish I didn't feel so...

30
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,038
Say it.

31
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,992
So damn stiff.

32
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,911
Casswell's down on 20?

33
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,230
Tip Top on Madison?

34
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,718
Levasseur.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,831
Le what?

36
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,399
Where's that?

37
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,075
Paris.

38
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,674
France.

39
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,228
I know where Paris is, nigger.

40
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,196
You lucky you was next.

41
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,710
I’m afraid no one
really takes me seriously.

42
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,355
I’m worried I’m letting you down.

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,115
Neely, sweetheart,

44
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,512
if I didn't think you were up to the task,

45
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,750
I wouldn't have put you there.

46
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,112
Yes, I could get any number of men

47
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,357
to sit in as my proxy, but no one,

48
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,192
not even your brother,

49
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,797
thinks the way I do more than you.

50
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,273
If you'd been born a man,
you'd be running this whole damn city.

51
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,271
I don't doubt it.

52
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,750
Besides, any bad news delivered to the board

53
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,313
or anyone else

54
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,715
would just sound sweeter coming from you.

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,076
-Thank you.
-Now finish your breakfast so you're not late.

56
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,633
Aye, aye, Captain.

57
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,839
That all of 'em?

58
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,989
Uh...

59
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,432
All that's living.

60
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,035
Got one more here, but he ain't moving.

61
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,438
Now he's moving.

62
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,272
He was dead
when we scraped him off the ground.

63
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,112
You a doctor?

64
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,033
Well, as far as I can tell,
he's another body delivered alive.

65
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,712
Wheel him in.

66
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,514
That's seven in all.

67
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,750
New building going up near Broad Street.

68
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,110
Me and Pouncey must have waited all week
for that crane to go,

69
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,078
but when it went, boyo, that really did it.

70
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,191
A holy show if I ever saw one.

71
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,875
Schuldheit and Sons,

72
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,190
so's you know where to send the bill.

73
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,271
I wager you'll already have your stretcher

74
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,079
waiting under me when my day comes, Cleary.

75
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,708
Might just.

76
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,711
Now, Mr. Barrow, it's the end of the month

77
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,028
and we need to be settling up.

78
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,951
Counting these seven, that's 22 altogether.

79
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,918
At two bits per,
that's five and a half you owe me.

80
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,310
Are you sharing with Pouncey?

81
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,635
Sure.

82
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,558
Just last week I bought him a pint at the pub.

83
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,791
He's a good lad, but he's thick as champ.

84
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,230
Get a bucket and scrub out that blood

85
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,311
and see me in my office
and I'll have your money.

86
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,759
-All right, mate.
-This one's dead.

87
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,149
You can drag him to the morgue.

88
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,914
Looks like you'll be
buying one less pint for your friend.

89
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,159
-What the fuck?
-I told you he was dead.

90
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,912
Get in.

91
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,074
See here...

92
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,190
And one, two, three.

93
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,357
And this is the pathological lab.

94
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,793
My workshop.

95
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,518
Only one in the city.

96
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,108
Other hospitals may frown
on studying the dead,

97
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,633
but I believe it is the only way

98
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,188
to advance our knowledge of the living.

99
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,473
The answers to disease
and the body do not lie in house calls.

100
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,395
They're here, in a lab,
where we can experiment and calibrate.

101
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,114
Cancer, syphilis, tuberculosis,

102
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,231
all their mysteries waiting to be unlocked

103
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,392
and take us soaring into the next century.

104
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,550
They built all this just for you?

105
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,069
The wealth supporting The Knick is endless.

106
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,913
And people here want their hospital
to be the best.

107
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,917
And they're willing to pay.

108
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,071
All I have to do is ask.

109
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,991
Of course, there are certain obligations

110
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,752
that come along with getting what I want.

111
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,319
Such as?

112
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,073
Hiring a new surgical apprentice.

113
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,070
How did you come to know
Captain Robertson?

114
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,913
I, uh, I did some work with him in Nicaragua.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,833
-Now he wants you here?
-No, that was my idea.

116
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,673
You are legitimizing surgery,

117
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,435
taking it out of the barbershops
and into the future,

118
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,555
and I want to be a part of it.

119
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,909
You do realize if you choose to join us,

120
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,275
the work will be hard and the hours long,

121
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,356
the results slow and agonizing,

122
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,513
and we will see no shortage of death
at our own hands.

123
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,755
But the rewards...

124
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,952
The rewards will be the achievement of it all.

125
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,718
"When the blast of war blows in our ears,

126
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,950
"then imitate the action of the tiger."

127
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,075
Hmm.

128
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,279
Shakespeare.

129
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,913
Never read him.

130
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,952
I think the smells are
what remind me of him most.

131
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,388
His cologne. His soap.

132
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,276
His cut tobacco pouch.

133
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,431
How are you, Catherine?

134
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,958
I miss him.

135
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,072
I, uh, I meant to pay a call.

136
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,834
Let us both pretend you mean that.

137
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,434
I failed him, John.

138
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,670
-No.
-I tried.

139
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,034
Country weekends,
time with the children, dinner parties.

140
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,193
I thought I'd opened the valve for him,

141
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,673
but the pressure was still there.

142
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,638
Blame is easy. Truth is harder.

143
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,679
Then what's the truth?

144
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,509
That my dear friend Jules lost sight
of the procedure.

145
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,556
Stopped seeing the work,
started seeing the death.

146
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,879
Is that the cardinal sin?

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,117
You did everything right.
You were a fine wife to him.

148
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,637
Once a man shifts his mind
from the surgical field

149
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,039
to the patient under the drape,

150
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,513
it's only a matter of time.

151
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,516
How will it not take hold of you
the way it did Jules?

152
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,830
I have ways of getting through.

153
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,749
Check that
ligature with saline for leaks, Everett.

154
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,758
It's holding fast.

155
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,191
Dr. Chickering will now
cauterize the end of the duct.

156
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,551
No flame needed.

157
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,949
But does it make toast?

158
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,719
Very good.

159
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,073
Get it off! Get it off!

160
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,153
Bertie! Bertie!

161
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,714
Nurse Elkins, saline.

162
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,154
Nurse Monk, don't!

163
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,473
My family and I paid
more than $12,000

164
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,079
to electrify this hospital.

165
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,835
I am as furious as you are, Miss Robertson.

166
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,273
I gave the man his charge. I am to blame.

167
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,510
Regardless of who's to blame, to my father,

168
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,272
we both appear incompetent.

169
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,592
If our goal in wiring the place was
to showcase our modernity,

170
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,353
then might I suggest that killing nurses

171
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,519
and setting patients afire might
undermine the message a bit.

172
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,275
We were just discussing this and I
am in agreement with you both.

173
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,750
The contractor must be held accountable.

174
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,029
We should run him out of business.

175
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,116
Or just beat the tar out of him.

176
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,509
Thack, there is a lady here.

177
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,712
Well, from the looks of her,
I'd say she'd take the first bat to the man.

178
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,518
I would if I thought it would help.

179
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,440
I think we should let our attorneys
take a swing at him first.

180
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,993
Agreed.

181
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,996
Before we go tying this up in court,

182
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,392
allow me to speak to this thief

183
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,949
and force him to make good on his contract.

184
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,396
I warn you, Mr. Barrow,
do not throw good money after bad.

185
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,033
I give you my word.

186
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,197
I will not spend a penny
of the hospital's funds.

187
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,990
You have one week to resolve this.

188
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,071
Thank you for your patience.

189
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,989
Was there something else?

190
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,913
Yes. I've been looking for Dr. Edwards.

191
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,472
Have you tried his office?

192
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,714
Hello?

193
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,673
Algernon?

194
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,439
Yes?

195
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,713
This?

196
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,431
They assigned you this?

197
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,079
With their compliments.

198
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,236
What about the empty space
next to Christiansen's old office?

199
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,270
They say they have another use for it.

200
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,872
And your medical work?

201
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,555
I've been ignored mostly

202
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,790
and barely been allowed to perform any task

203
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,718
beyond the skills
of a first-year medical student.

204
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,030
And as for my teaching, well...

205
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,476
You can't accept this.
You're the Deputy Chief of Surgery.

206
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,633
A position they believe
I hold because of your family, Cornelia.

207
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,076
I expect these things.

208
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,438
You're upset because you don't.

209
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,719
Hello, dear.

210
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,159
Thank you.

211
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,116
Oh, would you take a few steps back?

212
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,993
-Why?
-Please?

213
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,912
Into the light.

214
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,829
Eleanor.

215
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,678
Oh, don't be a stick in the mud.

216
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,512
I'm proud of you.

217
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,756
Look at the camera.

218
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,273
Thank you.

219
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,150
We'll frame that and hang it on the wall
above Lillian's crib.

220
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,750
-Ready for lunch?
-Let me fetch my hat.

221
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,512
Eleanor. Nice to see you.

222
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,676
-Likewise.
-How's, uh, how's Lillian?

223
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,190
- What is she, nine months now?
- Mmm-hmm.

224
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,268
She has your looks.

225
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,509
Which is a good thing.

226
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,110
Well, let's hope she has Everett's brain.

227
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,432
I was sorry to hear
about Everett losing the promotion.

228
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,794
-It should have been his.
-Eleanor.

229
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,950
It's all right, Everett. Let the lady defend you.

230
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,873
You deserve that job. You'll get it eventually.

231
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,670
Would you care to join us for lunch?

232
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,709
Other business to attend to, I'm afraid.
But thank you.

233
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,313
Herman.

234
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,392
When are we getting more cadavers?

235
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,308
We're through our last one,

236
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,231
and my surgeons seem to feel that practising

237
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,992
a procedure before attempting it

238
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,072
actually has merit,
at the very least for the patient.

239
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,516
I've been giving it my full effort,
but nothing's come loose.

240
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,318
We used to just compete for bodies

241
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,755
with Columbia, Cornell
and New York University,

242
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,195
but now everyone's training doctors.

243
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,234
What about Cleary's man
at the lunatic asylum upstate?

244
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,992
-He must have something.
-We were outbid.

245
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,877
Cornell is offering everyone triple.

246
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,995
I have checked with every indigent home,
prison and drunkard ward.

247
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,752
I can't seem to win a body.

248
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,668
Well, then offer more.

249
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,911
More than $75?

250
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,191
I need bodies, Herman.

251
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,114
Look, I have a lead on a failing heart
at Blackwell Island.

252
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,753
With any luck, he won't survive the week.

253
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,269
And if you need something
on which to practise,

254
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,954
we do still have a fair number of pigs.

255
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,952
His name is Mr. Gatchell. 35, day laborer.

256
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,439
History of syphilis.

257
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,712
He's suffering
from a rapidly growing aortic aneurysm,

258
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,711
eroding the second, third and fourth ribs

259
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,518
as well as the costal cartilages on the left...

260
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,399
...of the sternum.

261
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,393
Beside Mr. Gatchell is Mr. Olynyk.

262
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,397
40, sea captain, alcoholic.
No history of syphilis.

263
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,950
He, too, is suffering from an aortic aneurysm.

264
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,958
Complained of great pain
in the right side of his chest

265
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,036
to the shoulder when admitted.

266
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,630
Veins are dilated across the entire abdomen.

267
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,153
Diastolic shock can be felt.

268
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,989
Definite murmur can be heard.

269
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,913
Unless that's the damn lights
popping on again.

270
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,069
Treatment?

271
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,673
They were each given 10 injections,

272
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,792
250 cc's of a 1% gelatin solution.

273
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,229
Mr. Gatchell responded adequately.

274
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,151
Mr. Olynyk needed a second round.

275
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,675
Injection strength doubled. 17 in total.

276
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,478
It's all right. It's all right.

277
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,916
Let's open these shades, nurses, please.

278
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,833
We need more than window light, Herman.

279
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,269
I'm taking care of it.

280
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,874
Today or I will resolve it myself.

281
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,399
Absolutely.

282
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,312
We should prepare Mr. Olynyk for surgery.

283
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,868
He'll likely rupture within a day without it.

284
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,077
We'll, uh, ligate the aorta
with aneurysmorrhaphy.

285
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,196
I suppose
it's preferable to doing nothing.

286
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,272
Don't be so sure.
It's yet to produce anything but death.

287
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,794
Keep the, uh,
injections going with Mr. Gatchell.

288
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,552
Dr. Thackery,

289
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,792
I spent some time
at Hotel-Dieu Hospital in Paris...

290
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,677
Scrubbing the floors, were we?

291
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,959
Working with Dr. Pierre Thibaux.

292
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,597
We experimented using a galvanic procedure
on aortic aneurysms

293
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,432
and had a fairly good success rate.

294
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,878
Thank you, Dr. Edwards.
But if I want your ideas, I will ask for them.

295
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,720
Even if our procedure had a 60% success rate

296
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,314
over gelatin and aneurysmorrhaphy,
which have zero...

297
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,233
60%? I find that very hard to believe.

298
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,839
Well, let the paper that Dr. Thibaux

299
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,558
recently published speak for itself.

300
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,790
As far as I'm concerned, you're only here

301
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,996
to keep the lights on
with the Robertsons' money.

302
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,548
And from the looks of things,

303
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,870
you're not even doing that very well.

304
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,753
You’re a ripe
stick of shit, Barrow.

305
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,752
You want to come after me for your troubles?

306
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,637
You were the contractor.

307
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,914
We've had fires, surges.

308
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,629
A girl died, Clarence.

309
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,835
And you won't be laying that at my doorstep.

310
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,554
They come to ask Mulkeen
how this came about,

311
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,551
and I tell them
all about the money you squeezed.

312
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,756
You took the contract.

313
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,035
And you took all the dollars we needed
to do it right and true.

314
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,876
That girl's on your head.

315
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,915
I tell 'em so,
they'll be shackling you up in no time.

316
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,199
They want to get me
for kicking back to you after that,

317
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,670
they can have some good luck finding me
at my mother's in County Clare.

318
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,517
How much?

319
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,792
It's 1,000 to do it right.

320
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,789
800.

321
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,873
That's piss next to what you took.

322
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,349
It's all I've got left.

323
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,393
I'm robbing Peter to pay Paul.

324
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,953
And Peter still wants his money.

325
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,992
I swear on my children.

326
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,469
900 by the end of the day.

327
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,558
No drafts, cash.

328
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,838
Agreed.

329
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,797
A lot of gashes today.

330
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,116
We should charge on a per-stitch basis.

331
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,151
Were you told to monitor me?

332
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,679
What? No.

333
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,233
Of course not.

334
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,632
Those are finer sutures than I've ever done.

335
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,789
Please, try to hold your arm still.

336
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,030
Must you touch her so much?

337
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,790
Unless you expect
these stitches to appear by magic,

338
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,518
I'm afraid so.

339
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,557
So...

340
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,637
Is it true that you live
in the Tenderloin District?

341
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,235
Yes.

342
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,269
Oh.

343
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,038
I've been through in the day once or twice,
but not at night.

344
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,873
Is it really like they say?

345
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,958
if no one was looking and God didn't judge.

346
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,115
Hmm.

347
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,760
I was thinking of going to the Haymarket.

348
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,435
My friend who's been there
says it's the most, um,

349
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,512
entertaining dance hall in the city.

350
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,149
I'm guessing your friend will soon have

351
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,708
a burning sensation when he urinates.

352
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,518
It's nothing more shocking or exciting

353
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,158
than what you see here every day.

354
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,719
Go to the horse races or a boxing match.

355
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,308
Bertie, they're preparing Mr. Olynyk
for surgery.

356
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,039
-Thackery needs us to scrub in.
-Right.

357
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,395
Thank you, Dr. Edwards.

358
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,396
Okay, we are all done here.

359
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,955
You, young lady,

360
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,711
were very brave.

361
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,711
I'll return in a moment with the dressing.

362
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,839
Excuse me.

363
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,398
Excuse me, madam?

364
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,310
Your arm needs attention.
Where are you going?

365
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,789
The Negro Infirmary on Minetta.

366
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,235
I can drain it for you right here.

367
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,878
No, you can't.

368
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,711
A little more suction there,
Bertie.

369
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,319
Very good.

370
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,713
Dr. Chickering will now
cauterize the anterior wall.

371
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,955
Well, it seems the old girl's
not out to pasture yet.

372
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,116
Might explode,
but at least it won't electrocute you.

373
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,310
Perhaps it's not too late
for a career in the law.

374
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,960
Oh, cheer up.
You've got a much better chance of survival

375
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,479
than this fellow.

376
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,114
I've located the aneurysm.

377
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,476
It makes the aorta
look like it has a balloon on top.

378
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,116
Take a... Take a feel, Bertie.
Palpate the distal side.

379
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,991
Won't even stay firm against a pulse.

380
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,274
It's lost all of its form.

381
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,158
It's miraculous
it hasn't already ruptured and killed him.

382
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,639
It's only a matter of time.

383
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,869
Hunter's ligation?

384
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,712
Resect the weak spot, try to reconstruct?

385
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,199
Yeah, with an aneurysm that large,

386
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,555
once we resect it,
there won't be much tissue left

387
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,835
with which to reconstruct the artery.

388
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,030
-We have to try.
-We do indeed.

389
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,269
Nurse Pell?

390
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,113
Holding steady at 110 beats per minute.

391
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,356
Once we clamp the pedicle,
we're on the clock,

392
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,670
as ischemia is very possible.

393
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,716
Where is Nurse Elkins today?

394
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,554
She's taken the shift on the postoperative
ward for Nurse Monk.

395
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,552
It seems our young Bertram
is unusually aware

396
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,039
of Nurse Elkins' whereabouts.

397
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,350
You seem
very interested as well.

398
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,512
Clamp it, Everett. Forceps.

399
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,513
You need to hold that while I excise that edge.

400
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,632
It's shredding like paper.

401
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,597
140 beats per minute.

402
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,518
Give me some of that rubber tubing.

403
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,593
Then support the inside of the artery
while you sew around it.

404
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,916
There's nothing to work with.

405
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,111
It's in shreds.

406
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,389
Stay cool, Everett.

407
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,313
Just do what you can do
and continue to press on.

408
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,392
-All right.
-Now I'm gonna remove the tubing.

409
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,632
You close the hole behind it.

410
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,153
No, it's not going to hold.

411
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,357
Well, he'll certainly die if we don't try.

412
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,318
All right.

413
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,389
One, two, three.

414
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,919
I'll go to his family.

415
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,672
No, I'll go.

416
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,472
Bertie, you will accompany me.

417
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,915
We'll explain how the procedure failed.

418
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,475
It's tough luck, Everett.

419
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,596
He was doomed
before he entered.

420
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,319
We were simply attempting to reverse his fate.

421
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,474
There just wasn't enough healthy tissue
for the sutures to hold.

422
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,437
Well,
we better find a better solution

423
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,795
because it's Mr. Gatchell who's next.

424
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,995
What about Dr. Edwards?

425
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,116
The galvanic procedure he mentioned?

426
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,713
Forget Edwards. He's a fool.

427
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,713
Yes, but he's a fool
who studied with some very fine surgeons.

428
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,072
I'm loath to take up his errand,

429
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,914
but dumb luck may have
stumbled him into something useful.

430
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,432
And I think we can all agree

431
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,354
there is nothing less useful
than what we just attempted.

432
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,669
We don't need him,

433
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,354
we just need the surgical paper
on the procedure.

434
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,877
Dr. Wodsworth has an extensive library
in his office on Park Avenue.

435
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,679
He gets all the European journals.
We'll look there.

436
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,757
I highly doubt
they'll be too keen on sharing it

437
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,068
with anyone from The Knick.

438
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,628
Well, then be creative.

439
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,677
Gentlemen.

440
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,794
I take it you're here on behalf of Mr. Collier.

441
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,795
I would really prefer
you didn't just appear at my workplace.

442
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,950
Please don't touch that. It's an antique.

443
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,680
You were supposed to
meet Bunky this morning.

444
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,239
You owe your weekly.

445
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,477
Of course.

446
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,712
But there has been a tragedy.

447
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,795
Perhaps you heard.

448
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,555
A poor girl was electrocuted.

449
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,229
Which...

450
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,240
She could have been eaten by a whale

451
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,874
or punched out by Kid McCoy.

452
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,393
He don't care.

453
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,472
You're never too busy for Bunky.

454
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,755
See him by midnight

455
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,111
or you won't see the morning.

456
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,718
There, there.

457
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,276
All finished? All right.

458
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,433
Right.

459
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,831
Be back in a moment, darling.

460
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,793
How is he?

461
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,797
Mrs. Hemming,
I think you had better call for an ambulance.

462
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,679
Yes?

463
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,154
-Mrs. Hemming.
-Cornelia.

464
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,269
Hello.

465
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,750
I was told Cora
and your husband were admitted.

466
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,439
Typhoid fever.

467
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,275
First Daniel, then, a few days ago, Cora.

468
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,360
Typhoid? The doctors are certain?

469
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,395
Yes.

470
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,153
And how are you feeling? Any symptoms?

471
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,479
No, but Cora seems to have enough of them
for both of us.

472
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,114
I'm so terribly sorry.

473
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,193
I promise you
there are no better doctors in the city.

474
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,040
Anything you need from the hospital
or my family,

475
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,758
please let us know.

476
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,159
Just your prayers.

477
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,189
-Cadavers, Herman.
-Not now, Thack.

478
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,470
Use the pigs.
We have plenty of them out back.

479
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,949
I can't use pigs. It's an aortic procedure.

480
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,156
I need human cadavers.

481
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,833
I'll get them.

482
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,352
I'll get them!

483
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,598
Yes, she came in about 11:00
this morning, but wasn’t here very long.

484
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,797
Did someone take care of her arm?

485
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,678
No, she couldn't wait.
Said she had to get to work.

486
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,077
Did she sign your registry by chance?

487
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,998
I believe this is her.

488
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,519
Ida Harris.

489
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,429
Yes?

490
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,353
Here are those patient records you requested.

491
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,071
You've been avoiding me.

492
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,711
No, I haven't. I swear.

493
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,391
Take a seat.

494
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,719
Lucy.

495
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,114
-Please don't be nervous.
-I'm not.

496
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,799
Maybe you do make me a little nervous.

497
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,194
Well, after your experience
with me the other day,

498
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,271
that's understandable.

499
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,912
You found me in a sorry state.

500
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,799
And I asked something of you

501
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,117
that is beyond what a woman,
even a fine young nurse,

502
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,077
should be expected to do.

503
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,435
You know, my, uh, circus tent

504
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,590
is no place for a proper girl.

505
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,958
I was glad to help you.

506
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,034
I wasn't sure I was doing the right thing.

507
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,590
Does that happen to you all the time?

508
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,032
I mean...

509
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,233
You were so helpless.

510
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,436
I made a mistake.

511
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,308
I changed my routine
and I suffered dearly for it.

512
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,953
It won't happen again.

513
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,909
I'll be much more responsible
in monitoring my regimen.

514
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,877
Why do you need it?

515
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,471
Lucy,

516
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,834
there is a life we live
within the walls of this hospital

517
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,038
and one we live outside of it.

518
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,630
And these two lives need not intersect.

519
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,392
Do you understand?

520
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,392
I think so.

521
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:37,517
You saw me as no one else here has.

522
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,395
I did.

523
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,789
But I have a reputation here

524
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,996
in the medical community,
with my colleagues,

525
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,036
and any perceived weakness

526
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,311
could diminish their confidence in me
as a leader and as a surgeon.

527
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,433
And that in turn could
endanger the lives of my patients.

528
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,152
I understand.

529
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,192
What you saw

530
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,350
must remain between us.

531
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,353
Of course.

532
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,633
You sure we should put those on?

533
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,517
No one's ever here this time of night.

534
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,431
You've broken in here before?

535
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,391
He collects scrimshaw.

536
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,993
He won't miss a piece or two
every now and then.

537
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,230
Keep the details to yourself.

538
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,073
Holy...

539
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,633
What do you think, boy?

540
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,991
He suffers from gigantism.

541
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,958
Yeah, well, the Winslow Warlows could
use him as a punter.

542
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,991
Wouldn't even have to use a fucking cleat.

543
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,909
Oh!

544
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,472
This guy's nutsack's
the size of a sailor's duffle.

545
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,955
Huh?

546
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,479
Elephantiasis.

547
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,397
Well, I bet he can squirt.

548
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,759
I think this is it.

549
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,919
At least it could be. It's in French.

550
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,718
This way, please.

551
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,792
- This don't feel right.
- It'll be fine.

552
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,719
Please.

553
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,030
What part of the hospital is this?

554
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,718
Have a seat.

555
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,472
I'll have to drain this slowly
over several hours.

556
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,872
What are you doing?

557
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,311
I'm going to numb
the nerve trunks in your shoulder

558
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,753
that lead down into your arm.

559
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,673
Have you had cocaine before?

560
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,995
No.

561
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:21,156
You're going to feel nothing in your arm
and wonderful everywhere else.

562
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,517
It's truly a miracle.

563
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,594
Give me a beer, a whiskey,

564
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,832
and whatever else you got back there
to get me properly squiffed.

565
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,511
"J.F. Mumford
of the New West Side Athletic Club

566
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,838
"did not fight like an amateur
when he met L. Smith.

567
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,229
"In the first round, he sent Smith to the floor

568
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,679
"with a right punch to the jaw.

569
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,957
"Now in the third,
Smith began by landing some telling blows,

570
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,992
"but Mumford braced up and soon had Smith

571
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,354
"in a helpless condition."

572
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,670
Sounds like McCarthy getting
beat about by his wife.

573
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,998
Mr. T. Cleary of County Cork,

574
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,516
currently of Park Row,
took the fight to M. McCarthy,

575
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,796
shutting his mouth
and beating him with both fists.

576
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,390
He got what he was looking for,
didn't he?

577
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,076
I'm here for Nora.

578
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,910
And he has no knowledge
you’re in this way?

579
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,997
I could never tell him.

580
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,319
He's not the sort of man who...

581
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,359
He just gets angry. He doesn't mean to.

582
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,631
But another child...

583
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,795
I understand.

584
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,512
Does he know where you are tonight?

585
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,437
Oh, Lord, no.

586
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,196
He's at the bakery.
Halloran's on Chrystie Street.

587
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,199
He works the ovens
from 10:00 to 6:00 most nights.

588
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,516
He can't know.

589
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,516
All right, you needn't worry.

590
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,199
Does it hurt?

591
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,157
A little discomfort.

592
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,795
But your husband will know nothing of it.
I promise.

593
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,635
But will God forgive me?

594
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,872
I don't want to go to hell for killing a baby.

595
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,630
He knows that you've suffered.

596
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,237
I believe the Lord's compassion will be yours.

597
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,752
Now, I need you to lay down.

598
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,308
I will make this as painless as possible.

599
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,515
Almost back to normal.

600
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,276
You starting to get some feeling
back in this arm yet?

601
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,271
Yes, thank you.

602
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,230
If you have any more problems, come see me.

603
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,839
I Will.

604
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,956
My brother-in-law got
something wrong with his eye.

605
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,712
Think he could see you?

606
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,358
Absolutely.

607
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,038
This is a good deal, Bunky.

608
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,792
You don't tell me what's good and what isn't.

609
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,795
You don't tell me anything.

610
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,717
You don't come in here and change my rules.

611
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,553
I own you.

612
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,438
Slaves don't talk back to their masters.

613
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,958
Don't make me put another beating on you.

614
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,753
Please don't.

615
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,479
I came here like a man, didn't I?

616
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,400
A man doesn't come to me and beg.

617
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,070
A man doesn't get in the hole nine grand

618
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,799
and act like he's got choices.

619
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,590
A man pays.

620
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,150
Your weekly is due in two days.

621
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,033
You will pay in two days

622
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,032
or you will suffer in two days.

623
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,432
I just need a little more time.
A week at the most.

624
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,076
Two days!

625
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,037
I said two days!

626
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,917
What are you doing? What are you doing?

627
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,035
What are you doing?

628
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,269
Open.

629
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,435
No, no, no.

630
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,953
Open, open, open.

631
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,395
I'll hold on to that as collateral.

632
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,389
Hmm.

633
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,878
Well.

634
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,550
Mr. Paris Shoes.

635
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,197
How they look with a little

636
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,918
poor man's shoe polish on them?

637
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,671
Uppity motherfucker.

638
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,510
Think his ass don't stink.

639
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,238
You think you better than me?

640
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,554
Hmm?

641
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,518
How many bowls?

642
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,278
Four bowls.

643
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,278
Anything else?

644
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,952
No.

645
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,950
That's enough for me, Wu.

646
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,878
Dr. Thackery thinks that oranges are free here.

647
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,957
You come back soon?

648
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,758
Tonight maybe?

649
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,031
Where else would I go?
