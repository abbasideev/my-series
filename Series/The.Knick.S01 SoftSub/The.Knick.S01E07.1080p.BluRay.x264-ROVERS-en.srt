1
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,631
Pardon the intrusion, gentlemen.

2
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,268
William, good to see you.

3
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,553
What brings you up from Baltimore?

4
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,871
The board at Columbia
asked for a consultation

5
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,394
on how best to teach surgery
to their medical students.

6
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,040
Aha. We're all the rage these days.

7
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,796
Uh, William, let me introduce my apprentice,
Dr. John Thackery.

8
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,189
Thack, this is Dr. William Halsted.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,956
-Pleasure.
-Pleasure's all mine.

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,239
I had the good fortune
of working with your colleague

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,039
Dr. Osler in Philadelphia a few years back.

12
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,835
I know you're doing extraordinary things.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,672
Well, you're in good hands yourself.

14
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,795
J.M. was always a step ahead of me
in school, in sport,

15
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,995
and with the women.

16
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,911
Well, Dr. Thackery might best the both of us.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,231
In short order, he's proven
himself indispensable to The Knick.

18
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,877
High praise from someone
notoriously stingy with it.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,434
After what you witness today,
you'll be praising this man

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,193
in the hallways of your hospital
for years to come.

21
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,191
Then let me take my seat
and let the games begin.

22
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,874
Good luck, gentlemen.

23
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,193
You didn't have to do that.

24
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,317
I meant every word of it.

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,193
You're a comet in the sky, young Thack.

26
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,828
Embrace it.

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,988
I just feel that the surgery could very well fail.

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,389
You've rehearsed it over and over
in the pathological lab.

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,993
It will succeed brilliantly.

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,872
We've got a full theater out there.

31
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,555
Colleagues you've invited with the promise
of a great breakthrough today.

32
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,872
A man whose life hangs in the balance.

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,238
It could be the biggest finding of my career,

34
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,233
or an absolute disaster.

35
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,673
You're just nervous.

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,631
I am. Aren't you?

37
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,996
I won't be in a moment.

38
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,838
I wonder what Halsted would say
if he knew about this.

39
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,917
Who do you think told me about it?

40
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,632
The appendix is a
rudimentary, functionless organ.

41
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,555
A relic, really, and yet it still has the power
to fell a man in the prime of health

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,240
and has proven a difficult adversary.

43
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,837
The patient on the table is 25. An attorney.

44
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,229
No history of alcoholism or syphilis.

45
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,998
He was perfectly fit until yesterday,

46
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,355
when he was struck down
with acute abdominal pain.

47
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,637
Then Dr. Thackery quickly
deduced appendicitis.

48
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,470
The pain has worsened, the fever risen.

49
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,392
Vomiting began this morning.

50
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,755
We could take the usual course
with therapeutics,

51
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,435
but we know these yield poor results
and most often death.

52
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,511
It is my belief that there is a way
to almost guarantee

53
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,197
full recovery in all appendicitis cases,
and that is the complete removal of the organ.

54
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,954
They're ready.

55
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,952
Let's give 'em a show.

56
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,236
Dr. Thackery will make the first incision.

57
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,872
In countless trials,
Dr. Thackery has devised a way

58
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,032
in which to accurately determine
the location of the appendix,

59
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,796
thus eliminating the estimation
of where to make the initial incision.

60
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,913
Dr. Thackery.

61
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,429
Surgical knife.

62
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,475
By drawing a line
and divining the midway point

63
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,712
between the anterior-superior iliac spine
and the umbilicus,

64
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,633
parallel to the fibers of the external oblique,

65
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,430
no matter what the size or sex of the patient,

66
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,270
you will always find the appendix.

67
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,388
And there it is.

68
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,070
The Thackery Point never misses.

69
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,589
Please, Johnny. Johnny, please.

70
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,874
Please, Johnny.

71
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,349
Hold his arms and legs.

72
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,518
Get some towels.

73
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,755
You should load up his bowl.

74
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,353
He's gonna need something for the pain.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,479
And...

76
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,713
Could you, uh,

77
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,229
load up a fresh one for me, please?

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,353
Late night.

79
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,956
Been watching you
for a while from over there,

80
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,753
and I'm thinking
you might just be a clergyman's daughter

81
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,478
out here on the street like you are.

82
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,949
Pardon me?

83
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,118
I got an offer for you.

84
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,269
Could be good for both of us.

85
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,593
I happen to be acquainted with a Mr. Collier
who takes very good care of girls like you.

86
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,157
To have another dark one in his stable
might be good for business, so I suppose...

87
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,037
I ain't what you think I am.

88
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,196
Sure. Sure.

89
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,438
But might you be interested
in a little proposal?

90
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,038
Make you some good money
for what you're doing out here already.

91
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,909
What I'm doing out here
is waiting for someone.

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,275
Well, maybe I'm that someone.

93
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,909
That someone is my man,
and I ain't no streetwalker.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,989
You got that?

95
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,638
The hell you think you're doing?

96
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,153
He thinks I'm a street whore.

97
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,999
-Hold on.
-Tried making me an offer.

98
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,317
Trying to fuck my girl, is that it, Paddy?

99
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,994
Back off, spooky.
You don't want to start nothing with me.

100
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,394
The hell I don't!

101
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,152
Stop him!

102
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,356
Come on.

103
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,433
Hey, where you going?
Hey, somebody find that nigger!

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,955
A doctor!

105
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,031
Somebody run and get the doctor!

106
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,517
One of youse call the surgeons.

107
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,998
It's the cop Sears.

108
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,117
He's been out bad.
Stabbed by a dirty coon in the street.

109
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,189
Come on.

110
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,078
And up. All right.

111
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,832
Now come back at me, you gobdaw,

112
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,480
I'll bust you to your knees
and make you lick the back of 'em.

113
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,516
Back! Make way, we got real
working folk coming through.

114
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,397
-What's all this about?
-Not a clue.

115
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,799
They're boiling up about something.

116
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,711
Interesting way
to start your first day back.

117
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,360
It certainly is. Here, allow me.
Come on.

118
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,518
My apologies for my lateness.

119
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,272
I was taking Eleanor to see her parents.

120
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,828
There's no need to explain.
It's good to have you back.

121
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,511
So we'll repair the hole and re-inflate the lung
once the bleeding has stopped.

122
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,677
He'll have to make do
with the other one for now.

123
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,637
Nurse Elkins, forehead, please.

124
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,197
Me as well, Nurse.

125
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,713
Suction.

126
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,192
Tied off the hepatic artery,

127
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,350
but the renal is going to
require significant repair.

128
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,351
Well, let's do it.

129
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,554
He'll need that blood flow,
or he's likely to become ischemic.

130
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,233
You say you know him?

131
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,595
Officer Sears. Good man.

132
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,030
Used to go on calls with Speight for the HD.

133
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,873
And he's got a fine crowd outside
rooting him on to health.

134
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,359
Never mind who they're rooting against.

135
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,150
You know, when this surgery is through,
I will write a love poem to this machine.

136
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,912
Bertie, step aside. I'll do that.

137
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,869
So he's missed the aorta,
but hit the liver square.

138
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,632
Took a good slice out of it.

139
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,592
He should already be dead.

140
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,718
What is that?

141
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,994
This, Everett, is the miraculous
Edwards suction machine.

142
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,311
I'm building a second one.

143
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,198
For my birthday, I presume.

144
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,957
There you go, lad. All right.

145
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,919
Here we go.

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,274
-Whoa, whoa.
-Where's my boy?

147
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,759
Where are they keeping him? The butchers.

148
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,956
We're gonna take you to him, Mrs. Sears.

149
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,234
Phinny's a strong boy.

150
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,429
- Aye, strong.
- He'll show 'em.

151
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,839
Ain't that right, Jenny?

152
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,230
He'll be home bouncing Charlie and Ailish
on his knee again in no time.

153
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,113
Part the way.

154
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,679
Let the boy's family through.

155
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,830
-Let's go.
-Get your arses to the side!

156
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,193
The family is here.

157
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,559
We've done everything we can,
but the lung is still a problem.

158
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,952
We'll go back and repair that
if he gets stronger.

159
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,713
We've just got to hope
he makes it through the next few hours.

160
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,070
I knew Phinny. He's a good man.

161
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,639
You mean you know him.

162
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,798
Don't go digging any graves, missy.

163
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,758
Of course.
If there's anything you need, just ask.

164
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,637
You want to help us, do you?

165
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,673
Then find the devious nigger
that done this to our boy

166
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,830
and string him up in City Hall Park.

167
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,469
Oh, we'll find him and do just that, Mrs. Sears.

168
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,790
I'm not sure that's helpful right now.

169
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,032
We should be concentrating on the family
and praying for Phinny to get well.

170
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,473
You know what? Cut your shit spittin'.

171
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,558
-He's gonna make it just fine.
-Yeah.

172
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,913
Our Phinny's got more pluck
in his little finger

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,434
than all you got in all your sorry souls.

174
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,635
To Phinny!

175
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,432
Aye, to Phinny!

176
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,158
That's the spirit.

177
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,749
Bertie.

178
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,871
I'll be back to finish the chart, Nurse.

179
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,554
Has everyone gone completely mad today?

180
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,229
What do you mean?

181
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,828
First I had to push my way past
an angry mob to get into the building,

182
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,559
and then I had to push my way
past Edwards in the theater.

183
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,518
Ah. Well, you weren't in yet,
so Thackery needed an extra pair of hands.

184
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,115
It's more than that. He was treating him
like some old school chum.

185
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,949
And that contraption...

186
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,792
It's ingenious, I know.

187
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,115
No more nights of nursing my sore, tired arms
from all that cranking.

188
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,839
All right.

189
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,549
Do you remember when you were...
Must have been about three or four...

190
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,709
Excuse me.

191
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,633
...and you got your hand
stung by a bumblebee?

192
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,553
Do you remember?
It swelled up to the size of your head.

193
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,034
Who the hell are you?

194
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,951
I'm the deputy chief of surgery.

195
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,514
Nice to meet you. I'm the Queen of England.

196
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,038
Is he here to finish the job?

197
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,635
Ma'am, ma'am, I assisted in this operation.

198
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,636
What kind of hospital is this?

199
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,278
-All right.
-Nurse Elkins.

200
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,549
Yes, Doctor?

201
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,477
I'd like to change the dressing
on the lower wound, please.

202
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,798
1% acetate of aluminum.

203
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,393
Yes, Doctor.

204
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,275
You really got to take orders from him?

205
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,189
I take my orders from all the doctors here.

206
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,480
The day I let a nigger tell me what to do

207
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,278
is the day I dig my grave.

208
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,795
Okay. All right.

209
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,195
All right.

210
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,354
Officers.

211
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,359
All right.

212
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,558
The operation's over. They sewed him up.

213
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,077
He's breathing, but that's about all.

214
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,913
It'll be a while before we're
tipping pints back with him again,

215
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,117
so you might just go on home.

216
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,950
Could be days, lads.

217
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,632
Show's over. Go home.

218
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,119
We're not going anywhere!

219
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,592
Christ, you'd think
the heat would drive 'em back.

220
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,954
To where, the tenements?

221
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,559
Open the door!

222
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,158
His pain seems worse,
his fever has gone up,

223
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,231
and his breathing has become more shallow.

224
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,559
I know. I know.

225
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,790
What are you doing?
You can't give him that.

226
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,389
He needs something for the pain.
The hell I can't.

227
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,475
{GAGS)
{GASPS)

228
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,949
-Oh, in the name of the devil!
-Hematemesis.

229
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,837
-That ain't English!
-Internal bleeding. Something's not holding.

230
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,114
Should I get the theater ready?

231
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,079
No, there's no time. Bring me
a surgical knife, carbolic, clamps, silk.

232
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,593
Quickly!

233
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,193
Here you are, Doctor.

234
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,632
We, uh...

235
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,919
We won't be needing them.

236
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,633
Move back, lads.
Give her some air.

237
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,988
Off to the side.
You've seen enough.

238
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,035
Okay, let's go.

239
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,509
- Off to the side.
- A little respect here, gentlemen.

240
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,593
Okay, we're gonna
take care of that cotton-picker.

241
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,191
Right over here. That's it, right here.

242
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,592
Okay, it's over. It's over.

243
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,956
Mrs. Sears,
we're all saying prayers for your boy.

244
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,038
My boy is dead.

245
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,029
He's dead at the hand
of one of them black bastards.

246
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,557
Take down every one of them fucking darkies.

247
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,559
Rip their throats

248
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,757
and grind their eyes down to jelly.

249
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,638
Make 'em pay for
what they done to my Phinny!

250
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,709
Over there!

251
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,995
- Get 'em!
- Make 'em pay! Make 'em pay!

252
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,833
- Get the darkie!
- Kill that nigger!

253
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,553
Thack.

254
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,312
Thack!

255
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,198
What are you doing? Help him!

256
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,917
Stop it. Stop it. Leave him. Leave him!

257
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,230
You're just standing there.
Help him, God damn it.

258
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,194
Tell the nurses to lock
all the windows and doors.

259
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,508
What happened?

260
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,676
We need to get this man to the clinic.

261
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,232
You need to stay out of sight.

262
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,872
Harry, I got one for you.

263
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,758
Been slashed to ribbons.

264
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,037
Get me silk, two clamps,
and a Steinhart's needle.

265
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,957
Can't see. Can you see anything?

266
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,195
No.

267
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,950
- Oh, watch yourself!
- Shit!

268
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,911
No, stop.

269
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,753
- You can't be in here.
- We need help.

270
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,717
No, no, no. You need to get out.

271
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,472
- Hey, get them out of here.
- Back up.

272
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,152
- No niggers allowed.
- You can't be here.

273
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,754
I said get out of here!
No niggers allowed!

274
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,115
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, get off!

275
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,351
Edwards!

276
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,513
My apologies.

277
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,712
We're gonna have to separate the room.

278
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,951
Let's get all the Negro patients
over to this side.

279
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,113
You're letting them stay?

280
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,028
-Thack, this isn't a Negro...
-Not the time, Everett.

281
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,474
You got something to say
to his killer?

282
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,039
I got something to say.

283
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,155
Excuse me.

284
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,958
What I got to say
you can't print in your paper.

285
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,190
- Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry, ma'am.
- But I'll say it anyway.

286
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,389
- Excuse me.
- What is it, lad?

287
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,710
Them fucking darkies are...

288
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,076
-Help me up, lad. Help me up.
-Whoa. Whoa.

289
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,469
The one who killed our Phinny
is in the hospital.

290
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,991
Them kids saw with their own eyes.
He snuck in the back.

291
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,993
And they're treating
that murdering Quashee right now.

292
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,909
Get the rope.

293
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,632
The cotton-picker
that got Phinny's inside.

294
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,879
Shit, they got ropes.

295
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,995
-Really?
-Yeah.

296
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,479
They get in, hit 'em with this.

297
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,354
All right.

298
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,749
I can't get away.
I'm having a bit of a situation here,

299
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,593
but nothing to worry yourself about, dear.
All is well.

300
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,715
It's fucking mayhem out there.

301
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,836
They're gonna have the doors open
in about 10 seconds.

302
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,714
I just wouldn't come
south of 50th Street today.

303
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,994
All right?

304
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,679
I love you, too.

305
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,436
Maybe the police should break up the crowd.

306
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,835
The coppers are the ones
fucking spurring them on.

307
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,399
God damn it!

308
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,879
Heave! Heave!

309
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,959
Shit.

310
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,077
The mob is in the building.
They are destroying this hospital.

311
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,949
Okay, listen, everybody.
We need to get the Negro patients out of here.

312
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,075
You, help me.

313
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,111
We're gonna have to
treat them someplace else.

314
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,559
Let's take the south stairs
through the basement.

315
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,877
Let's go. Quickly.

316
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,712
There's a bunch of darkies in here!

317
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,673
Hey!

318
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,113
Come on!

319
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,119
Those are our fucking horses!

320
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,313
Whose side are you on?

321
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,988
This isn't a good idea.

322
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,798
Drastic times.

323
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,269
Where the hell are we going?

324
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,635
What in God's name is this?

325
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,113
Is this an operating room?

326
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,629
An exam room, lavatory,
a postoperative ward,

327
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,278
and whatever else I need it to be.

328
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,429
You did this?

329
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,594
You can't do this.

330
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,238
I think he did.

331
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,235
And you knew?

332
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,311
How else could I have helped him
as much as I did?

333
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,117
It's only a matter of time till they find us here.

334
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,868
Why? I never found it.

335
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,598
They're obviously looking
harder than you did.

336
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,714
Aren't you a laundress?

337
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,870
Down here I am a surgical nurse.

338
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,953
God help me.

339
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,671
And did you steal all of this equipment?

340
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,273
Most of it I bought.

341
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,351
Other items I rescued and repaired.

342
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,675
But not the obstetric equipment.

343
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,034
I stole that.

344
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,797
You delivered babies down here?

345
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,518
-Two.
-Algie.

346
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,036
I want every Negro
out of this building right now.

347
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,873
Mr. Barrow is right,
but not for the reasons he believes.

348
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,318
Everyone here who can walk on their own
will have to find shelter elsewhere.

349
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,032
But no one is safe out on the street.

350
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,832
-Especially them.
-I'll take them.

351
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,069
Our Lady of Sorrows has a friary
a few blocks down where they'll be safe.

352
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,236
Even hooligans won't riot in a church.

353
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,509
They may leave, but I will not allow you...

354
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,238
Are you volunteering, then?

355
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,554
-No.
-Then I'll thank you not to interfere.

356
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,998
I'll have one of the other sisters
come with me.

357
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,230
Thanks, Harry.
Everett, would you go with them?

358
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,589
Yes, Thack.

359
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,910
Your recoveries, can they get on their feet?

360
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,353
Certainly not well enough to
run through the streets in a riot.

361
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,512
Then we'll have to transfer them
by ambulance to another facility.

362
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,272
Any ideas for a destination?

363
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,069
The closest hospitals are
Presbyterian and Bellevue.

364
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,309
Too far.

365
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,913
The Jewish hospital will take them,

366
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,072
but that would mean crossing through
two Irish and one Italian ghetto.

367
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,310
They belong in a Negro infirmary.

368
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,159
There's one in Little Africa on Minetta.

369
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,912
How do we get outside
without being killed by that mob up there?

370
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,558
Take the back stairs to the ambulance bay.

371
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,673
Where are the horses?

372
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,432
Ask the fuckers who stole 'em.

373
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,234
What do we do now?

374
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,595
-We take them ourselves.
-On foot?

375
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,719
Bertie, I need a surgeon to
stay here on call until we've returned.

376
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,518
-Can you brave it?
-Of course.

377
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,270
Dr. Edwards,
you can't be seen out there in plain sight.

378
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,908
I know, but I'm not leaving my patients.

379
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,639
We won't have enough of us
to transfer all the patients.

380
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,433
Load the gurneys.

381
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,439
I'll take the rest.

382
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,393
How?

383
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,114
How are you doing, Mr. Cleland?

384
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,918
The bumps make it hurt.

385
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,232
Hypodermic. Squibb's liquor of opium.

386
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,794
Arm or abdomen?

387
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,279
Arm is fine.

388
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,313
You want me to stop moving?

389
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,838
Not unless you need to.

390
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,551
Everyone stay under your wraps.

391
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,717
And where are you all going?

392
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,119
We're heading downtown.

393
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,151
I meant more specific like.

394
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,274
What you got under there?

395
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,034
Just let us pass
and you won't have any trouble.

396
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,756
You'll have trouble if I say you do.

397
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,438
We're headed to the city morgue.

398
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,875
- What for?
- Leprosy outbreak.

399
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,231
Can't keep them at The Knick.
Need to burn the bodies down there

400
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,356
before anyone else gets it.

401
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,114
You can look, but about a week from now,
you're gonna be down on your knees

402
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,714
trying to find
where your testicles rolled off to.

403
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,274
Away! Back away, I tell you!

404
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,918
You'll all be damned to hell

405
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,752
if you touch one hair
on these people's heads!

406
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,193
Keep walking.

407
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,272
You'll all face the fires of hell
if I have anything to say about it.

408
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,588
And you know I do.

409
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,114
One of them could be
the fella that killed Phinny Sears!

410
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,555
Hump off! You didn't even know the man.

411
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,832
I think they've finally given up.

412
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,478
I suppose they have.

413
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,078
Probably off to go destroy
someone else's place.

414
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,634
Wherever that may be.

415
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,915
As long as it isn't here, I don't give a damn.

416
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,475
Let's finish cleaning up this glass,

417
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,512
and we need inventories on
all medicines and equipment.

418
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,273
And patients.

419
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,556
I want all patients accounted for.

420
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,958
Don't put any weight on it.

421
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,508
Just go home and get some rest.

422
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,558
Fuck home. I'm going uptown.

423
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,870
They got all the whores
turned out in the street.

424
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,758
Fellas are running trains on them.

425
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,837
Cops are too busy to do anything about it.

426
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,239
Nobody leaves
until this place is back the way it was.

427
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,628
Who's in charge here?

428
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,597
Dr. Williams. Over there.

429
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,999
Dr. Williams?

430
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,319
I'm Dr. John Thackery,
Chief of Surgery over at The Knick.

431
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,198
This is my assistant chief,
Dr. Algernon Edwards.

432
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,511
-Algie.
-Moses Williams.

433
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,830
-You know each other?
-We were at Harvard together.

434
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,514
Moses was the one in his year
and I was the one in mine.

435
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,874
-I'd shake hands, but...
-Of course.

436
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,878
We know you're overrun here,
but we brought you seven more.

437
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,678
It was too dangerous
to keep them at The Knick.

438
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,035
We'll help out in any way we can.

439
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,954
Then pick a patient, get started.

440
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,795
You're welcome to any of our supplies.

441
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,475
Thank you. We're out of just about everything.

442
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,269
Thread, carbolic, clean bandages,
alum, cocaine.

443
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,918
We'll make do.

444
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,592
You see anything that way?

445
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,592
Keep moving, buddy. It's closed.

446
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,398
But, Officer, I'm family.

447
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,392
Of a worker in a whore shop?

448
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,956
For the love of Christ,
the whole town's going crazy

449
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,837
and you want to get your fucking log dunked?

450
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,474
No one's going in the establishment
till this fracas is over.

451
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,472
I understand, but this is urgent.

452
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,829
Do I look like one of these hooligans
tearing the streets apart?

453
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,594
I don't give a good goddamn
if you're the second coming.

454
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,796
You're not going in.
Now take it on the arches.

455
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,230
-Excuse me.
-Go on, get! Get!

456
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,754
-All right! God damn it!
-Get out!

457
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,873
Hurry up! They're coming here!

458
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,399
Junia.

459
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,597
I just wanted to make sure you were...

460
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,111
I'm fine, Hermie, but you need to go.

461
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,316
I'm nearly done if you're next.

462
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,398
You can put it down.

463
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,113
You need a break?

464
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,075
I can have someone else
step in to help me finish.

465
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,388
No, I'm fine.

466
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,472
And there are so many more.

467
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,998
Towel.

468
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,679
For you.

469
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,959
Jamison.

470
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,756
-Who is Jamison?
-That's me. I am.

471
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,389
What do we have?

472
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,550
Gashed upper thigh and buttocks.

473
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,871
Dr. Williams, have a look at this.

474
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,273
He's cut through to the bone.

475
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,038
We'll have to sew it up in layers.

476
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,031
We have no more anesthetic.

477
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,031
No morphine, no cocaine.

478
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,113
We'll just have to hold him down.

479
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,192
- He's gonna thrash.
- We will make do.

480
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,679
Edwards.

481
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,549
You don't have to stay with me
if this is too offensive for you.

482
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,073
I've seen a buttock before.

483
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,077
-A black one?
-Yes, yours.

484
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,873
When we'd play in the garden
with the water pails

485
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,155
and you'd run around without pants.

486
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,151
-We were three.
-And he saw mine.

487
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,798
For God's sake, Neely.

488
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,915
Suction.

489
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,079
That's enough.

490
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,439
What's next?

491
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,710
"Pass the needles through the intestinal wall

492
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,276
"one half-inch below
and, drawing the threads,

493
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,638
"invaginate the end of the upper portion
into the lower through the slit."

494
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,719
Okay, but this is intraperitoneal.
So what do I do then?

495
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,799
I don't know.

496
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,270
Okay, well, show me the photograph.

497
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,119
So I can see it.

498
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,314
Got it.

499
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,114
Sorry.

500
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,195
Who's next?

501
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,151
This is the last patient.

502
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,397
Then it looks as though
our work here is done.

503
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,998
It would be nice to catch up
in quieter circumstances.

504
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,837
Find out how you landed at The Knick
with the great John Thackery.

505
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,359
I'd like that.

506
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,159
Take care, Moses.

507
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,837
Thank you.

508
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,035
The rain seems to have calmed things a bit.

509
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,353
It may seem quiet,
but we have no idea how safe the streets are.

510
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,511
Well, we can load the gurneys
in the ambulance,

511
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,272
but I ain't got the strength
to pull 'em back alone.

512
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,032
So you got to keep pushing.

513
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,511
-I'll help you.
-I'll come, too.

514
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,115
I want to check on the condition of things.

515
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,509
I'm sure my office is a shambles.

516
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,118
Then I'll see Nurse Elkins gets home safely
and I'll meet you there.

517
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,679
What about my bike?

518
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,675
Well, if it hasn't
already become a victim of the riot,

519
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,512
it certainly won't at this point.

520
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,717
You can get it in the morning.

521
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,914
All right.

522
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,719
Unbelievable.

523
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,550
I thought for certain
all this would be destroyed.

524
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,792
They didn't even come down here.

525
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,475
I guess I pushed you across town
under a gurney for nothing.

526
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,310
Not for nothing.

527
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,799
What sex?

528
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,828
What?

529
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,916
The babies you delivered.

530
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,073
Oh.

531
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,752
Um, two girls.

532
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,309
You've become someone I didn't expect.

533
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,278
What, a sneak with a scalpel,

534
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,756
plying his trade in dark corners?

535
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,513
No, though that was a surprise.

536
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,676
Then what have I become?

537
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,955
You did something remarkable here.

538
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,156
And to watch you today...

539
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,828
I suppose I still thought of you
as that little boy I grew up with.

540
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,314
The one without the pants?

541
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,152
The very same one.

542
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,310
I was terrified for you today.

543
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,590
The whole city wanting to hurt you.

544
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,508
And with only you to protect me.

545
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,719
I would have.

546
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,197
I have no doubt.

547
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,237
I doubt I'm allowed much further.

548
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,275
It's all right.

549
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,716
I'm sure the housemother is still asleep
and she's practically deaf.

550
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,068
I guess it was a good thing
things were happening so fast,

551
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,593
'cause I didn't have any time to think.

552
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,676
Well, you did brilliantly.

553
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,237
Okay, good night, Nurse Elkins.

554
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,552
Really well done today.

555
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,476
My roommate's already gone to work.

556
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,278
You can come in if you like.

557
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,157
I need help taking this off.

558
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,957
Will it hurt?

559
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,877
I can make it painless

560
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,838
and perfect.

561
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,352
Hi.

562
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,553
What?

563
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,359
What?

564
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,397
What?
