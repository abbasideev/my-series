1
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,639
Oh, come on.

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,197
Not your day there, Cleary.

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,589
All right, all right, all right.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,872
Here's the deal, I get a bull's-eye

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,356
and Quinn buys a round.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,591
The day you get a bull's-eye, Cleary,
is the day I suck off a horse.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,157
All right, fuck the pint.

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,113
You're on.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,228
Yeah!

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,355
Somebody find us a horny stallion!

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,948
Open up, Quinn. Come on, open up.

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,759
Come here. Hey, you forgot your hat.

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,390
-He thought I was serious.
-Weren't you?

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,278
I'd have let him go
before the horse drizzled him good.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,479
Here you go.

16
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,713
Doors.

17
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,119
Got it.

18
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,432
Mrs. Zygmund.

19
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,111
I am Mr. Barrow,

20
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,672
director of The Knickerbocker Hospital.

21
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,593
My deepest condolences.

22
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,957
He fought the good fight.

23
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,758
He was cremated?

24
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,479
But he purchased a cemetery plot

25
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,431
only a few month ago.

26
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,474
It was his final wishes,

27
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,070
which he stated to me

28
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,029
just moments before his passing.

29
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,838
And out of respect for your grief,

30
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,157
I've cut the cremation fee in half.

31
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,710
So we'll only be needing $5
before we release him to you.

32
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,197
You can waste your time
scrubbing in if it suits you,

33
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,751
but I told you,

34
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,197
your role is to talk Gallinger
through the procedure, nothing more.

35
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,958
There will be no risk of ischemia,

36
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,679
as you will not need to clamp
the descending aorta.

37
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,270
Nurse Pell, pulse, please.

38
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,918
It's weak at 110.

39
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,629
Mmm-hmm, that's the blockage.
Dr. Gallinger, locate a site

40
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,029
above the weakened
arterial wall of the aneurysm

41
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,274
that will be able to endure a small puncture
and subsequent manipulation.

42
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,391
Should be good there.

43
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,556
Once you make your incision,
blood will begin escaping the aorta.

44
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,074
Death by exsanguination is a risk,

45
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,717
but once inserted correctly,
the clotting properties of the galvanic wire

46
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,910
will likely halt the danger.

47
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,913
All right, ready?

48
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,078
It's your mount.

49
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,199
What's next?

50
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,158
Edwards, what's next?

51
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,037
Edwards, the man is bleeding out.

52
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,997
Suction, Bertie.

53
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,116
Do you really have the courage
to see this through?

54
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,475
And only taking the scalpel will do?

55
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,592
The pedal is more faint.

56
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,036
Carotid is eccentric now.

57
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,430
He'll break.
He won't want a death on his head.

58
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,114
Perhaps you'll break first, Everett.

59
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,236
We don't have time for your nigger games.

60
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,952
More suction, Bertie.

61
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,951
I've lost the pedal pulse.

62
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,031
Water rises, air becomes scarce.

63
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,076
Which man can survive the longest?

64
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,718
Care to wager, Bertie?

65
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,438
No, thank you.

66
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,034
Very well. Take the knife.

67
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,708
Now we have a show.

68
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,552
We won't be needing this.

69
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,280
We tried copper in Paris and it failed.

70
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,399
An alloy with silver is preferable
for proper conductivity and corrosion.

71
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,277
You were gonna let us use the wrong wire?

72
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,828
I never would have let you
get that far without me.

73
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,075
You roughen it to increase the conductivity?

74
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,355
Seems to double the effectiveness.

75
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,752
I'll now feed the wire through
so that it coils in the aorta,

76
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,832
making good contact with the aneurysm.

77
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,953
Pulse is weak.

78
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,754
If he dies because of your horseshit,

79
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,753
I am going to stab you in the throat
with my father's Union Army sword.

80
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,478
Union? I would have thought Confederate.

81
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,118
Need the electrical terminals.

82
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,429
Oh, allow me.

83
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,074
The way things have been working
so well around here electricity-wise,

84
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,354
be my guest.

85
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,316
10 milliamperes, please.

86
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,750
Careful you don't cook the man.

87
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,556
The pedal pulse is back.

88
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,559
Carotid is regular.

89
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,076
The aneurysm is beginning to clot
and harden.

90
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,716
Looks like it's Mr. Gatchell's lucky day.

91
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,751
How long does he remain this way?

92
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,919
For an hour to ensure the clotting is complete
and the weak tissue has fully firmed up.

93
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,277
Then clip the wire, stitch the incision

94
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,278
and close.

95
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,831
So I suppose we won't be needing
your expertise any longer.

96
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,795
I suppose not.

97
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,675
Gallinger!

98
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,988
Idiot.

99
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,752
A surgeon needs his hands.

100
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,399
Help him up.

101
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,635
Everett, scrub out.

102
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,913
Next time, kick the man instead.

103
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,791
Right on time, Mr. Speight.

104
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,869
Always.

105
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,757
Even got myself a new tie for the occasion.

106
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,997
It's very nice. Shall we call on her?

107
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,913
This place is no big deal.

108
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,230
Miss Cornelia Robertson
and Mr. Jacob Speight

109
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,799
of the New York City Health Department.

110
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,916
You're a mister, mister.

111
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,117
I'm Inspector Speight.

112
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,991
Cornelia, dear.

113
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,070
I'm so sorry about Daniel. He was a good man.

114
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,114
The finest.

115
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,156
But I hear Cora is doing a bit better.

116
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,118
Yes, I was there this morning.

117
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,430
The doctors are feeling optimistic
after the surgery.

118
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,078
Well, that is good news.

119
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,195
Yes.

120
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,749
Inspector.

121
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,990
If you don't mind, I'll not shake your hand,

122
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,958
owing to the disease
and not knowing your hygiene habits.

123
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,917
You owe Mrs. Hemming an apology.

124
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,798
Miss Robertson,
every human being has bowels

125
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,440
and every one of them
evacuates those bowels.

126
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,592
It's how God made all of us, no matter who.

127
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,714
What he didn't guarantee is that everyone
would wash their hands after doing so.

128
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,355
It's how the fever found its way
into this house just like any other.

129
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,872
No offense meant.

130
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,751
-Would you care to sit down?
-Oh, thank you.

131
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,232
You need something?

132
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,630
I was speaking with Mrs. Alford.

133
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,799
She was concerned
that you hadn't been by to check on her.

134
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,157
I have sent Dr. Chickering.
He's kept me informed.

135
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,515
She believes you're avoiding her.

136
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,271
I'm doing no such thing. It's simple protocol.

137
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,116
She said that? That I'm avoiding her?

138
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,278
In so many words.

139
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,237
-You seem to be enjoying the coffee.
-It's mighty good.

140
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,476
It's prepared Turkish style. The best.

141
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,675
It certainly is.

142
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,716
No fear of disease there?

143
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,236
The boiling keeps it safe.

144
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,271
We”, shall we get on with it?

145
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,909
I'm happy to help in whatever way I can.

146
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,716
Your husband and daughter took ill
at the same time or staggered-like?

147
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,909
Uh, first Daniel in the evening,
then by the next morning, Cora as well.

148
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,716
Had your husband
been away recently? Perhaps traveling?

149
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,438
Not recently.

150
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,913
What about at his place of work?

151
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,035
He doesn't work.

152
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,472
Didn't, I should say.

153
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,356
What about lady friends?

154
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,633
I have many.

155
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,632
I meant your husband.

156
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,915
Were you aware of anything he had going on,
on the side?

157
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,075
Inspector!

158
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,997
You want the truffles,
you need the pig to get his nose a little dirty.

159
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,470
Perhaps the pig can at least
try to be less of a swine.

160
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,352
I'll do my best.

161
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,751
So, Mrs. Hemming,

162
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,831
would you say your husband was

163
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,677
an upstanding gentleman?

164
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,629
He was.

165
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,314
Hmm, I'm sure.
And how many on staff?

166
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,632
Approximately 15.

167
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,354
A few come and go.
We add on extras part-time.

168
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,635
Cooks, maids, as we need them.

169
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,319
Some come to our summer house with us,

170
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,198
others stay behind
and keep this house ready for our return.

171
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,509
Peach mera?

172
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,079
You make your own ice cream?

173
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,549
I've never seen it
outside a confectionary store.

174
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,196
Would you care for some, Inspector?
It was Daniel and Cora's favorite.

175
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,998
But it's not cooked.

176
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,635
Are you sure you're willing to risk it?

177
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,470
You're right, Miss Robertson.
I really did forget myself that time.

178
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,357
Back to the issue.

179
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,638
So, Mrs. Hemming,

180
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,189
I'll need to ask you about your toilet rituals.

181
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,070
"By the shores of Gitche Gumee
By the shining Big-Sea-Water

182
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,592
"Stood the wigwam of Nokomis

183
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,551
"Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis"

184
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,473
I love the hand gestures.

185
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,751
This is how I was taught it
in third-grade elocution class.

186
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,678
I'm sure
you were the most adorable one.

187
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,320
- I was.
- Come on, come on.

188
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,511
"Dark behind it rose the forest

189
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,832
"Rose the dark and gloomy pine trees

190
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,271
"Rose the fir with leaves upon them..."

191
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,589
"Cones upon them."

192
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,199
He was so close.

193
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,679
That's two bottles
you owe me,

194
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,591
Thackery the Wise. No, three.

195
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,116
-Three? How?
-For the appendix.

196
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,636
Which part?
The removal part or the location part?

197
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,039
The removal part.

198
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,519
Oh, the part
that no one has survived yet.

199
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,797
When I prove
that the appendix can be removed

200
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,792
and the patient can live, we shall make history

201
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,114
and I shall get my third bottlIe.

202
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,390
But how can you remove it if you can't find it?

203
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,878
Hey, you know what?

204
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,552
I think we should get out of here.

205
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,868
You're turning in?

206
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,270
No, no, no.
There's a hundred parties in the city tonight.

207
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,918
Let's go out and have some more drinks.

208
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,316
John, maybe we should just,
you know, say good night.

209
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,994
Nonsense.
Jules, you up for more Christmas cheer?

210
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,439
You buy the booze,
I'll cheer all night long.

211
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,431
John.John,don;t

212
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,238
What is it? What's the matter?

213
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,669
It's been such a pleasant evening.
Let's just stay here.

214
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,911
Abby, come on.
We're just gonna have a bit more fun.

215
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,152
You always want more.

216
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,310
I always want more of you.

217
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,518
Merry Christmas, everyone!

218
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,831
I just came by to check on you.

219
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,836
Is it because you saw me raising my hand?

220
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,194
Oh, what is the steam for?

221
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,998
It's infused with mercury.

222
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,748
It's to help with those headaches
you've been getting.

223
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,555
Thank you, Nurse.

224
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,233
It looks good.

225
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,398
The flap is vibrant.

226
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,756
I can see some healing already.

227
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,473
Looks like it'll be a healthy attachment.

228
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,197
Don't be so serious, John.

229
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,638
It doesn't suit you.

230
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,072
And it makes me as uncomfortable
as it makes you.

231
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,990
Sit, please.

232
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,635
This good attitude will be very helpful
over the next few weeks.

233
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,474
And the next few decades.

234
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,795
Usually I'm the one
putting my patients at ease.

235
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,430
Oh, but I'm not just any patient.

236
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,716
No, you're not.

237
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,880
I know this isn't easy for you.

238
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,198
I told you, I'm very used to this condition.

239
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,951
Of course.

240
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,438
You could have gone to any one
of a dozen surgeons in this city.

241
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,030
But I chose to see you.

242
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,799
And that wasn't fair.

243
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,834
Oh, we're well beyond what's fair.

244
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,753
There's nothing about
what's happened to you that's fair.

245
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,319
I suppose I came because

246
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,278
I wanted to remember what it was like before.

247
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,278
Everything

248
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,276
stretched out in front of us.

249
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,034
I should have chosen you,

250
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,396
despite the madness that would have come.

251
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,710
I wish that were true, but it's not.

252
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,518
You made the right choice in leaving me.

253
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,395
You just did it with the wrong man.

254
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,957
We were something,
weren't we?

255
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,475
Alive and beautiful.

256
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,835
We were spectacular.

257
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,998
See?

258
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,752
Back in no time.

259
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,873
No emergencies.

260
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,676
And I was able to get my wife's dresser
to her mother's without incident.

261
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,159
Your wife's dresser?

262
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,717
My wife's dresser.

263
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,593
Well, I'll just leave 'em hitched up

264
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,240
in case the missus has
any more furniture she needs moved.

265
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,470
Now, that would be advisable.

266
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,471
Mr. Cleary.

267
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,352
I need a moment.

268
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,556
That's all it usually takes me.

269
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,354
I want to know what you've been on about
these past days.

270
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,034
The smirks, the comments, lurking around.

271
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,759
You know,
you never paid me any heed before, Sister.

272
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,193
Besides, perhaps I'm just taking the piss.

273
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,355
It stops now, Cleary, or I won't hesitate
to take it up with Mr. Barrow,

274
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,118
and your employment will be terminated.

275
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,631
That's a funny word to use.

276
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,598
Terminated.

277
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,634
You'll stop your shenanigans,
is that understood?

278
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,798
I'll do as I please.

279
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,514
It's you who'll do all the understanding.

280
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,711
See, I know about you.

281
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,315
The mothers, the babies, the abortions.

282
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,073
Maggie Dell, Jana Krupp,

283
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,436
the Kupferschmidt girl
above the cobeer on Ludlow.

284
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,317
I've seen you with all of them.

285
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,554
Cleary... Thomas...

286
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,677
Don't. You are what you are.

287
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,913
You defy God and you kill his creations.

288
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,515
And you stand there looking down
on dirty old Cleary.

289
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,753
Well, old Cleary's got it in store for you.

290
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,516
You see, a girl could hang for killing babies.

291
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,354
And if the bishop knew what you were doing,
you'd be up to your arse in it there, too.

292
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,034
You'd do that to me? Are you that cruel?

293
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,713
If need be.

294
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,079
You see, there is money to be made here,
Sister,

295
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,280
and I don't intend to leave it for anyone else.

296
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,432
From now on, you'll split your earnings.

297
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,711
60-40, tilted my way.

298
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,878
I can't. I won't.

299
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,158
You can,

300
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,999
'cause you already did.

301
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,789
Anything to conclude?

302
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,235
Hardly.
I need to come back, interview the help,

303
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,472
talk to some of the sick families
and their staff.

304
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,313
We need to get a full picture of this
if we're gonna get to the bottom of it.

305
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,358
Fine, I'll arrange it
with Mrs. Hemming and the others.

306
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,594
Think I can get a lift downtown?

307
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,636
No. Good day.

308
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,633
That's okay.
I need to root around their garbage anyway.

309
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,239
Evening, son.

310
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,639
Evening.

311
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,918
You here to get Cornelia?

312
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,509
No.

313
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,797
I came to fetch you for a dinner
the Robertsons are having tonight

314
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,480
for Cornelia and Phillip, her fiancé.

315
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,036
The Captain asked for you personal.

316
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,034
I just had to see it with my own eyes.

317
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,153
My boy, a doctor at The Knick.

318
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,279
Ain't that something?

319
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,719
You should have come in
and seen it from the inside.

320
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,757
I'm okay out here.

321
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,839
So, boy, you save anyone's life today?

322
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,957
Actually, I did.

323
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,395
Not that any of them were very happy about it.

324
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,472
If all you got is that shiner,
then it's a good trade.

325
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,433
Any others, or you the only one?

326
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,189
Only one in a white hospital
in the whole city, I think.

327
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,189
Can't be others till there's one.

328
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,878
Used to be a great old building.

329
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,638
Neighborhood, too.

330
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,038
Captain Robertson lived down here.
And Vanderbilt.

331
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,553
Now they've gone uptown

332
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,837
and it's all them from who-knows-where
down here.

333
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,357
People just leaving it to 'em.

334
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,877
Taking our work
and making a mess of the place.

335
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,711
- Is that him?
- Mmm-hmm.

336
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,993
That's him.

337
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,192
Is he really that good?

338
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,079
He really is.

339
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,355
- But I think I might be better.
- Dr. Thackery.

340
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,319
Dr. Thackery.

341
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,590
Thank you for coming to see Mrs. Alford.

342
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,272
You think I did it for you?

343
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,718
No. Of course not.

344
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,873
I just know it meant a lot to her.

345
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,236
She was my patient
and I was checking on her, that's all.

346
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,517
Good evening, Nurse Elkins.

347
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,115
Chinatown. Mott and Canal.

348
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,870
Then Everet tjust
socked him in the eye.

349
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,392
What did the Negro doctor do?

350
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,429
Nothing. He just got up and kept operating.

351
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,232
-Dr. Thackery didn't get mad?
-No.

352
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,630
No, I actually think Thackery enjoyed it.

353
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,357
Did any rub off?

354
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,915
Any what?

355
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,353
Any of his coIlor.

356
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,429
Clara.

357
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,069
Edith Dutson said it can happen.

358
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,037
Right, well,
Edith Dutson and her whole family

359
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,793
also believe
that Jesus Christ came to America.

360
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,274
Ahem.

361
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,033
Good evening, Father.

362
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,913
Why don't you
and your sister wash up for dinner?

363
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,757
Well, it's your turn after dinner.

364
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,789
It's okay. I think you're cheating anyway.

365
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,795
So how was work today?

366
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,872
Was that asylum true to form?

367
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,117
No, nothing eventful happened
that I can recall.

368
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,077
Jesse, how many times I tell you,

369
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,230
do not come into my kitchen
with them boots on?

370
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,517
I do not need manure all over the roor.

371
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,553
Does that go for me as well?

372
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,915
Algie!

373
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,673
My boy.

374
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,997
Oh, what... What is this on your face?

375
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,832
The boy saved a life today.

376
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,717
Well, since when is that news?

377
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,070
Though he could get on a telephone
and let us know

378
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,199
what he's up to now and then,
instead of just coming by once in a while.

379
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,436
The Captain has
two of them in the house now.

380
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,354
One upstairs and one downstairs,
so somebody can always hear it ringing.

381
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,756
So busy that you can only come
when you get a formal invitation,

382
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,558
but not to see his loner mama.

383
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,989
Loner?

384
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,308
Jesse, please.

385
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,630
Them horses the one get all your attention.

386
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,631
Their feet need tending to.

387
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,638
And mine don't?

388
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,389
Algie!

389
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,790
I am so happy you could make it.

390
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,199
I appreciate the invitation.

391
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,671
Oh, we're throwing this little welcome-back
for Phillip and I wanted you to meet him.

392
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,388
You're the last of us
to give him final approval.

393
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,470
I don't think you've met Hobart Showalter,

394
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,630
Cornelia's future father-in-law.

395
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,433
A pleasure, Mr. Showalter.

396
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,235
The Captain speaks very highly of you.
Says you're a gifted surgeon.

397
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,673
That is very generous.

398
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,320
There's no need for modesty, Algernon.

399
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,233
You will never meet a Negro with
as much ability and ingenuity as this one.

400
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,676
And you let me know
if I need to help you with Thackery.

401
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,149
Hobart's in rubber.

402
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,430
Has plantations down in Ecuador.

403
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,431
- Booming business?
- Beyond belief.

404
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,590
He's agreed to finance my expansion.

405
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,318
I have no doubt the rewards

406
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,595
will be worth any risk.

407
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,993
Ecuador. I hear the jungles down there
can be quite treacherous.

408
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,439
Don't believe it.

409
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,149
The natives are like children, docile, obedient,

410
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,196
and they work for wages so small

411
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,430
that even August here couldn't quarrel with it.

412
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,394
Yeah, free labor
can certainly change the equation.

413
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,873
History has shown us that.

414
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,313
It built the pyramids.

415
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,793
Among other things.

416
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,599
Now, Hobart was saying
that he has seen an increase

417
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,319
in demand for rubber in the medical field.

418
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,958
Some interesting new companies.

419
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,638
A lot of opportunities for a clever man
with greater ambitions.

420
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,790
It's something you should want to look into.

421
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,478
I should indeed.

422
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,237
You want to join us?

423
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,754
I'll set you up with a yen tsiang.

424
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,713
Jade bowl. Beautiful pipe.

425
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,919
And since our meeting at the Hemmings',

426
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,639
the health inspector's uncovered
three more cases with typhoid.

427
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,039
-All uptown?
-Yes.

428
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,793
There's another group of cases
down in the Orchard Street tenements,

429
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,110
but Mr. Speight's not sure if they're related.

430
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,232
I hope you won't be conducting
any interviews with those people.

431
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,790
Those people are 90%
of the patients in The Knick, Mother.

432
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,393
Cornelia.

433
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,314
Last fall, Gloria Ellis and several others

434
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,709
took a walking tour
of the poor neighborhoods.

435
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,269
The Jewish quarter. The Tenderloin.

436
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,073
They had to toss their shoes
before getting back in their carriages

437
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,948
because they were covered
in the most disgusting sludge.

438
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,954
And in my neighborhood, we call that sludge
the poor man's shoe polish.

439
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,919
Evening, Mrs. Robertson.

440
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,959
Phillip, I'd like you to meet...

441
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,109
Dr. Edwards.

442
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,553
What gave me away?

443
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,278
Are you here
to see your mother?

444
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,588
She's in the back.

445
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,998
Actually, Captain Robertson
sent me a personal invitation for the evening.

446
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,318
Oh, of course he did,
and we are delighted that you accepted.

447
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,435
Mmm-hmm.

448
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,431
Would you excuse me for a moment?

449
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,913
Phillip just arrived
back from San Francisco yesterday.

450
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,434
Yes, your father was telling me.

451
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,159
So, are you back for good, then?

452
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,713
For now.

453
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,954
Sometime after the wedding,
Cornelia and I will head out that way again.

454
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,392
Neer, you haven't mentioned a move west.

455
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,395
That's because this is news to me.

456
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,759
Your father wants someone there
on a more permanent basis.

457
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,671
I know the territory better than anyone.

458
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,953
Getting Cornelia
out of New York,

459
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,712
you will need all the help you can get.

460
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,513
Well, San Francisco is a great city.

461
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,475
In many ways,
more progressive than New York.

462
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,710
I shouldn't say that too loudly in here.

463
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,917
Captain, if you will,

464
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,560
when I point to you,
please speak into the horn.

465
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,710
With pleasure, Mr. Edison.

466
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,711
This is Captain August Robertson.

467
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,196
I am happy to demonstrate this machine.

468
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,634
How fortunate we are
to be living in these times.

469
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,434
Very good.

470
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,553
You all right?

471
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,233
Just a little surprised
by Phillip's announcement.

472
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,799
San Francisco?

473
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,398
Might as well be Neptune.

474
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,034
We can always send you some of your father's
wax recordings if you get loner for home.

475
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,915
This is Captain August Robertson.

476
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,995
Oh!

477
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,391
Bravo! Bravo!

478
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,992
...to be living in these times.

479
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,469
Oh, listen to that.

480
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,198
Oh, that's marvelous.

481
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,511
-Well done, Mr. Edison. Well done.
-Thank you. Thank you all.

482
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,551
Ha! Marvelous.

483
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,719
-Let's do another.
-Okay.

484
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,594
Hobart Showalter tells me

485
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,240
your company has made
great strides with suction.

486
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,999
Vacuuming.

487
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,071
An electric method to suction.

488
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,308
How is it With liquids?

489
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,159
-What kind?
-Blood, specifically.

490
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,840
-Blood?
-For surgical purposes.

491
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,593
Can it vacuum blood
without being too forceful?

492
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,956
We could adjust the power

493
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,552
and make a bag with a rubber bladder
to hold the contents.

494
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,200
You'd need to clean the works with regularity,
but it can be easily done.

495
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,793
May I?

496
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,278
How much do you want for it?

497
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,991
I'm starting to pick some of it up.

498
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,993
You always said Latin and Greek

499
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,231
were the most important languages
for a physician to learn.

500
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,992
Turns out it's actually
something called Yiddish.

501
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,111
Her lungs are full.

502
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,153
Fever

503
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,073
Liker pneumonia.

504
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,116
Doesn't look like tuberculosis.

505
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,033
When it gets this busy, we have to prioritize.

506
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,795
Two means she's a secondary emergency.

507
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,189
Hmm.

508
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,111
What does he look like to you?

509
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,673
Dead.

510
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,192
We're needing some help!

511
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,510
Help!

512
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,036
He don't need a shoeshine.
He needs a doctor.

513
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,758
My neck's all froze.

514
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,319
How long have you been this way?

515
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,753
He's seizing.

516
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,115
Get him down, Bertie. Get him down.

517
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,789
Try to turn his neck.

518
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,029
Fingers away from his mouth.

519
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,076
Don't come in contact with any quuids
if you can help it.

520
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,355
-He knows.
-Fever, convulsions,

521
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,313
disorientation,
his body is bowed and the neck.

522
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,835
It's two of the Kernig's signs. It's meningitis.

523
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,319
Dead on.

524
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,431
- What are these?
- Rat bites.

525
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,156
He was baiting rats in the ring.

526
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,152
Stomped on a big one
and lost his footing in the mush.

527
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,231
They started biting the shite out of him.

528
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,750
I'm gonna guess
there's no chalk marking for that.

529
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,919
Let's sit you up.

530
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,511
Oh, shit! What is that?

531
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,592
Cantharidin. Spanish fly.

532
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,112
Form a blister, a counterirritant
to help you with effusion.

533
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,434
If his fever goes up,
put the ice bladders on him all night.

534
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,717
Continue with a tincture
of three drops of veratrum viride every hour

535
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,190
until his skin becomes moist
or he complains of nausea.

536
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,195
I'm going home, but I'll be back
first thing to check on him this morning.

537
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,192
What do you think you're doing?

538
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,793
I'm reading his chart.

539
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,238
Surely there's no harm in that.

540
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,197
There's harm in everything you do.

541
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,791
You want to take another swing at me?

542
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,472
I'm ready this time.

543
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,389
Hmm?

544
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,230
Any chance of finding a home for her?

545
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,433
For babies it's easier,
but girls are less in demand.

546
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,796
I'll file the birth certificate.

547
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,190
And she'll need a name.

548
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,833
Perhaps Matilda.

549
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,393
Tilly for short.

550
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,793
I see her more as an Elisha,
from the Book of Luke.

551
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,315
The Bible really took my Tilly suggestion

552
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,879
right out at the knees.

553
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,029
We'll need to purchase more bassinets
and perhaps another pram or two.

554
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,588
Church fund?

555
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,870
The Knick's social welfare office account.

556
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,598
You did have the privilege of naming her.

557
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,511
Very well. My office will pay.

558
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,875
But her middle name is now Grace.

559
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,357
You ladies certainly do enjoy
playing with babies.

560
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,638
Yes, that's all we do around here.

561
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,790
Just play with babies.

562
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,633
I'm home.

563
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,958
Good evening, darling.

564
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,118
How was your day?

565
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,239
Not as bad as yesterday.

566
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,669
Did Dr. Edwards apologize
for his trickery

567
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,591
with your patient in the operating room?

568
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,559
Far from it.

569
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,796
It only seems to have emboldened him.

570
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,589
Started looking over my shoulder,
checking my work like a schoolmarm.

571
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,749
The smug bastard.

572
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,829
Everett!

573
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,559
Lillian can't understand. Come here, sweetie.

574
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,113
Hello.

575
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,952
What are you going to do about him?

576
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,593
Hold my ground.

577
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,870
Only be a matter of time

578
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,475
before Edwards gets tired
of waiting in the wings and leaves

579
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,955
and I'll get what was rightfully mine
from the beginning.

580
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,439
Let's just hope Thackery
continues to feel the same way.

581
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,152
Not to worry.

582
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,233
Thack is fully on my side.
He knows who's right and who's wrong here.

583
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,468
The orderlies have a nickname for Edwards.

584
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,635
They've taken to calling him Dr. Darkie.

585
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,748
That's terrible.

586
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,478
But funny.

587
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,478
Supper will be ready shortly
if you'd like to wash up.

588
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,113
In a minute.

589
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,398
Hi. Hi.

590
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,839
Ambulance!

591
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,959
Miss?

592
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,279
What seems to be the problem?

593
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,759
Shall we go for a little ride?

594
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,068
Oh, dear.

595
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,953
What have you done?

596
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,638
Get up there. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

597
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,993
All right.

598
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,350
All right, I am not a fucking doctor.

599
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,159
I'm taking you to a doctor, all right?

600
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,795
Pouncey, pick up the fucking pace!

601
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,789
I want her unconscious now, Bertie.

602
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,951
Cut through the clothes.

603
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,720
Prep the pubis and the abdomen.

604
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,712
And summon Sister Harriet.

605
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,313
I'm here. What do we have?

606
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,674
It can only be one of two things.

607
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,398
Too much blood.
That's no miscarriage.

608
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,515
We've got to get in there now.

609
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,033
- She under, Bertie?
- Almost.

610
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,752
Scalpel, Lucy.

611
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,517
You were here first. She's yours.

612
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,433
She's out.

613
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,477
Retractor.

614
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,515
Oh, it's a sea of red.

615
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,113
Suction wand.

616
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,312
I can't find
where this is coming from.

617
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,313
Most likely the left lateral.
Search the left uterine wall.

618
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,432
Cauterizer.

619
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,550
There it is. Clamps. Clamps.
Lots of clamps. She's split wide.

620
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,554
How did you know?

621
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,153
Most people are right-handed.

622
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,919
So whatever she put up there,
the angle would likely mean

623
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,798
she'd perforate the opposite side.

624
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,195
She did this to herself?

625
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,998
She didn't want to be with child.

626
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,639
She's arresting.

627
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,917
She won't survive.

628
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,473
Not a chance.

629
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,272
I have no pulse.

630
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,511
Keep on the wound. Scalpel.

631
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,279
What are you going to do?

632
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,108
I'm going to try
something I've been considering.

633
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,709
I have a pulse.

634
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,279
That's me, Bertie.

635
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,838
I'm pumping her heart.

636
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,753
See?

637
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,991
-I've stopped.
-Nothing.

638
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,880
- Now I have a pulse.
- It's me again.

639
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,438
- Now?
- Nothing.

640
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,112
Her heart won't take back up again.

641
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,509
Her lungs won't cooperate. She's gone.

642
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,038
What a terrible waste.

643
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,231
Come here, Bertie. Give it a try.

644
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,152
At least we can salvage
something from the misery.

645
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,999
Just push through
and when you feel her heart,

646
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,119
just squeeze it gently.

647
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,837
I have a pulse.

648
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,352
We'll find a use for it.

649
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,475
Ahem.

650
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,672
Quite a day.

651
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,031
I'm sure some of what you saw was shocking.

652
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,470
It was nothing of the sort.

653
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,712
I started in a place that makes your benighted
Knickerbocker look like a utopia.

654
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,236
I will myself to remember it with crystal clarity

655
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,512
so that I will never choose
any course in my life

656
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,511
that would bring me back
to that horrible place.

657
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,434
I climbed out of there so that you could
have options that I only dreamed of.

658
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,752
And I choose The Knick.

659
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,592
For what?

660
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,358
Romance?

661
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,276
The idea that there's some sort of nobility
in poverty, in the struggle?

662
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,475
Believe me, there is no such thing.

663
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,269
There is only poverty in poverty
and struggle in struggle.

664
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,797
And one day you'll wake up and realize that
and it'll be too late.

665
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,078
Thackery is doing things
no other surgeon is doing.

666
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,718
And with good reason.

667
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,077
How he defiled that girl.

668
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,518
He's a showman, nothing more.

669
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,951
All Thackery wants is a goo-goo-eyed puppy,

670
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,193
and he has that in you.

671
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,958
How he treats you.

672
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,395
How they all do.
It was sickening to watch them.

673
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,876
You not only allow them to call you Bertie,
you encourage it.

674
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,391
They mean it with affection.

675
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,552
They mean it with scorn.

676
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,671
You are a physician.

677
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,395
And my son.

678
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,473
And you should be addressed at all times
as Dr. Bertram Chickering Jr.

679
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,436
Nothing less, ever.

680
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,199
Dr. Edwards.

681
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,998
Mr. Barrow.

682
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,435
Terrible shame
about the young lady.

683
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,999
Yes, it was unfortunate.

684
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:11,309
Well, I'm going to make sure
proper arrangements are being made.

685
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,472
Yes, and I am heading to my office
to gather my things.

686
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,754
Mmm.

687
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,592
Well, good evening.

688
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,599
And you.

689
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,517
Awful, isn't it?

690
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,553
Number 11 is mine.

691
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,232
I don't know what you mean.

692
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:29,790
Do you have any idea what the going price is
for a fresh body these days?

693
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,716
We can split it if you like.

694
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,234
Fuck it.

695
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,798
Harry.

696
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,912
Let's go for a ride.

697
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,476
I need you.

698
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,797
You ever been down here before?

699
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,359
No.

700
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,473
My first job off the boat was doing
what these fellas are doing.

701
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,873
Standing in a hole all day
shoveling the dirt out,

702
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,868
rain, shine, frozen ground,

703
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,112
not giving a shit
there were bodies in them boxes.

704
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,398
Just get the job done fast
so you don't lose a wage.

705
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,511
Used to be all Irishmen digging.

706
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,396
Now it's Polacks.

707
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,198
Where do they bury you nuns?

708
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,070
In one of the church cemeteries.

709
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,557
I'm sure it's quite a to-do.

710
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,193
Religious folk, family,
all coming to say their last.

711
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,317
She ain't got no one but us.

712
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,070
The girl had no family?

713
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,831
Landlord said she came over anne.

714
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,878
Russia or someplace.

715
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,078
Didn't even know her last name.

716
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,708
Getting her rent money,
that was good enough.

717
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,589
There's a whole family somewhere
thinks their girl's alive and well in America.

718
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,113
Shame.

719
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,350
This whole place is full of shames like her.

720
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,109
All coming here hoping to Christ
the stories they heard is true.

721
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,990
Thinking that every fucking plonker
who steps off the dock

722
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,310
trips dead into a bucket of money.

723
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,433
But then you get here

724
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,273
and it ain't that.

725
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,712
And if you ain't strong enough,

726
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,070
this city will bugger you 18 different ways
and leave you to rot.

727
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,676
Where's the fucking dignity?

728
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,789
Today wasn't an easy day.

729
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,999
I have seen some crazy, bad shit, Sister.

730
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,679
Set it down easy. Set it down easy.

731
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,320
But the look in that girl's eyes,

732
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,519
the terror,

733
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,638
that was too much even for me.

734
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,756
Now you know why I do what I do
for these girls.

735
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,876
Don't go justifying your baby murdering.

736
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,439
I still don't like it.

737
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,510
But I won't see another girl bleeding to death
and winding up here.

738
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,598
So how's about this,
I find the girls needing services

739
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,832
and you do the job on them, good and safe?

740
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,549
Still a 60-40 split in your favor?

741
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,959
It's fair play.

742
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,952
How's I see it, you got a far better chance
of meeting Saint Peter than I'll ever have.

743
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,309
I'll need the extra to live good down here
before I head wherever I'm going.

744
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:43,831
She was clutching hard to this saint
around her neck when we picked her up.

745
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,158
She must have been a believer.

746
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,871
Or at least today she was.

747
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,432
Theodore the Black.

748
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,509
He became a monk at the end of his life
and repented his wicked ways.

749
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,791
If there was hope for him...

750
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,553
Afraid not, Harry.

751
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,032
Even so,

752
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,598
would you like to say something or should I?

753
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,348
You and I both know
it'd be hypocritical coming from me.

754
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,751
Do her more harm than good.

755
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,309
Hey, you boys want to fuck away off?

756
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,955
The sister wants to say a prayer.

757
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,834
Give her some smart words to go on her way.

758
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,512
O God, by your mercy,

759
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,075
rest is given to the souls of the faithful.

760
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,035
Be pleased to bless this grave.

761
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,080
Appoint your hon angels to guard it

762
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,840
and set free from all the chains of sin

763
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,515
the soul of her whose body is buried here,

764
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,356
so with all thy saints

765
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,509
she may rejoice in thee forever.

766
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,720
Through Christ our Lord, Amen.

767
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,873
Right.

768
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,117
Good night, Nurse Elkins.

769
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,798
467 Mott Street.
