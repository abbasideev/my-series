1
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,639
Hold it right there!

2
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,632
What do you think you're doing?

3
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,876
The charges stand as follows.

4
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,352
"A man identified as John Wilkinson Thackery

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,434
"was apprehended inside a pharmacy

6
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,718
"at number 745 Hudson Street
at 3:00 this morning.

7
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,149
"At that time, he was observed
to have in his possession

8
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,711
"an assorted half dozen stolen bottles
of cocaine and paregoric."

9
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,869
Paregoric?

10
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,717
The man doesn't have enough problems.
He suffers from diarrhea, too.

11
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,190
Ever since this country's cargo ships

12
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,191
became bottled up in the Far East,

13
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,153
not a night goes by we don't arrest
a couple desperate hopheads

14
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,071
or them that would sell it to them.

15
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,229
Surely you don't mean to include
Dr. Thackery among those miscreants?

16
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,200
He is a white man,
those are immigrant crimes.

17
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,236
He was holding a hypodermic needle.

18
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,356
He is also a practicing doctor.

19
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,271
And he had removed his shoes.

20
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,028
Captain,

21
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,993
if I can convince the owner of the pharmacy

22
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,074
to drop his complaints against Dr. Thackery,

23
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,599
will this sufficiently
satisfy your understanding

24
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,796
of the letter and the spirit of the law?

25
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,918
Breaking and entering carries with it
a minimum sentence of five years

26
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,714
at Sing Sing.

27
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,758
And something for the roundsman
who apprehended him.

28
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,198
So I think this makes us even,
don't you think?

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,389
- You need a lift?
- No, thank you.

30
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,076
I need to stretch my legs.

31
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,477
Where do you live?

32
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,795
Park Avenue, just below the train station.

33
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,193
Climb aboard.

34
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,873
To your health, sir.

35
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,035
What are you even about?

36
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,513
What?

37
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,799
I always assumed the reason
Dr. Thackery never decamped

38
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,472
to a more prestigious hospital

39
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,189
is because he was in some way
indebted to you.

40
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,197
Let me ask you a question, Mr. Barrow.

41
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,795
I'm not going to find out to my displeasure
that you've known about

42
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,520
Dr. Thackery's condition all along, am I?

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,437
I can say that I never wanted to
believe this about Dr. Thackery.

44
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,474
I bought myself a hospital full of doctors.

45
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,235
You ought to be able to find one
who can treat him.

46
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,631
Here's something that'll interest you.

47
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,554
"Narcotic shortages caused by the war
wreak havoc here.

48
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,031
"A case in point, last night, a man identified
as a prominent New York doctor

49
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,271
"was arrested after breaking into
a Greenwich Village pharmacy

50
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,875
"in order to meet the increasingly
desperate needs of his patients.

51
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,632
"Informed of the doctor's motives,

52
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,712
"the proprietor of the pharmacy,
Mr. W.A. Cleveland,

53
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,918
"hailed his selflessness
and subsequently withdrew the complaint."

54
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,559
John?

55
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,437
John, let me in!

56
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,154
You alone?

57
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,238
Of course I am.
Who would I be with?

58
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,797
"When sorrows come,

59
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,714
"they come not single spies,
but in battalions."

60
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,712
-I beg your pardon?
-Who sent you?

61
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,034
-Nobody sent me.
-Was it Robertson?

62
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,519
-Miss Robertson?
-Her father.

63
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,272
Did that son of a bitch
send you to spy on me?

64
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,351
John, did something
happen to you last night?

65
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,712
You look terrible.

66
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,268
-When did you last eat?
-I'm not hungry.

67
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,436
Have you slept?

68
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,953
That is the question.

69
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,993
I've never been more tired in my life.

70
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,240
Why don't you let me give you a bath
and put you to bed?

71
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,551
I can't go to bed. I have bedbugs.

72
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,228
You don't have bedbugs.

73
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,390
I can feel them under my skin.

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,753
I've treated people with bedbugs
and that's not what they do.

75
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,348
Wait a minute. How did you know
something happened to me last night?

76
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,879
Barrow sent you, didn't he?

77
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,793
It was in the morning newspaper.

78
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,952
-I don't believe you.
-It didn't name you.

79
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,708
But the way you've been acting,
I just assumed...

80
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,712
I don't believe you. It was Barrow
who sent you to spy on me, wasn't it?

81
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,915
Wasn't it?

82
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,839
Oh, God.

83
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,713
Oh, God.

84
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,678
What can I do to help?

85
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,952
Nothing.

86
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,876
Just tell me what I can do.

87
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,237
You can find me

88
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,748
an ocean of cocaine.

89
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,679
Look here.
What’s your game?

90
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,153
Well, I assure you
there is no game, Mr. Collier.

91
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,795
You don't think I know why you're here?

92
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,237
You think I don't know how to read
between the lines?

93
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,993
That was your man Thackery, wasn't it?

94
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,756
Your top doctor's turned out
to be a fucking cocaine fiend.

95
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,833
You see what dire straits we're in
when a man of Dr. Thackery's reputation

96
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,554
must resort to burglary
for the sake of his patients.

97
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,198
Oh, for Christ's sake.

98
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,272
I'm in the hooker trade.

99
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,352
You don't think I recognize
a burny blower when I see one?

100
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,312
Then you also know
that it is in your best interest

101
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,153
to get Dr. Thackery back on his feet.

102
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,118
Because I can never repay you without him.

103
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,836
Well, I ain't gonna loan you any more money,
I'll tell you that right now.

104
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,269
But I may find it in my heart

105
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,511
to advance your man
some few bindles of the drug.

106
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,028
You can do that?

107
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,112
Ain't you been listening?
I'm in the hooker line.

108
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,835
How do you think these dumb young clucks

109
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,679
are able to face each day
of their miserable fucking lives?

110
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,991
Cocaine, morphine, ether.
I can get my hands on practically anything.

111
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,718
Consider it part of your loan.

112
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,637
Mr. Collier,

113
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,870
I don't know how to thank you.

114
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,992
Oh, oh.

115
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,392
Aw...

116
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,313
You can thank me

117
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,995
by never again fucking telling me

118
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,035
what's in my fucking best interest,
you fucking mutt!

119
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,353
That's no problem at all. And thank you.

120
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,998
Dr. Johnston from Metropolitan
did black out at the last surgical conference.

121
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,718
It was a bit of a scandal, really.

122
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,916
I'd wager anything
it was Thackery.

123
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,792
Don't let me interrupt.

124
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,348
I believe you were
all talking about Dr. Thackery.

125
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,397
It would account for
the superhuman energy he has.

126
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,631
Perhaps it's what distinguishes
a great man from an ordinary one.

127
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,318
I'd say it's more likely
some sort of drug addiction.

128
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,231
What's the man accused of stealing?

129
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,355
Cocaine and paregoric.

130
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,714
Why paregoric?

131
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,916
They drink it for
the camphorated opium it contains

132
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,594
so they're able to sleep on those
rare occasions when they actually do.

133
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,069
Thackery shows all the signs.

134
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,195
Boundless energy,
euphoria alternating with exhaustion.

135
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,195
Insomnia, paranoia,
a compulsion to itch, hallucinations.

136
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,514
In nursing school,
I treated some soldiers who were addicted.

137
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,033
Nurse Elkins,

138
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,359
do you have a moment
to discuss next week's rotation?

139
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,633
I don't know.

140
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,190
Johnston has this very weird laugh.

141
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,633
I mean, we shouldn't rule him out.

142
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,992
Tell me what you know about
Thackery's condition.

143
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,877
I don't know anything.

144
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,875
Your loyalty is commendable,
but I need to know everything right now.

145
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,313
I don't know a thing.

146
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,959
Let's both of us be frank here, shall we?

147
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,190
You're betraying no confidences here.

148
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,636
I was the one who fetched him
from the police station this morning.

149
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,153
-Is there really no cocaine to be found?
-No, there is not.

150
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,196
And I ought to know.

151
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,191
Since this war began,
I've been horse-trading

152
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,551
every manner of drugs
from every reputable hospital

153
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,352
and pharmaceutical company
on the East Coast.

154
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,000
What about the disreputable ones?

155
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,311
Is there anything I can do?

156
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,195
Pray for peace in the Philippines.

157
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,748
Not now.

158
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,353
Well, I suppose you get
what you pay for.

159
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,475
HOW did this happen?

160
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,471
He stubbed his toe
against a table leg.

161
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,871
Looks like
he gave it a good swift kick.

162
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,110
It wasn't nothing
but a little out at first.

163
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,590
But it won't close
and that was two weeks ago.

164
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,953
Was he always like this?

165
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,915
A couple of times a day whenever
he's not eating, and he's always eating.

166
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,513
I never knew a boy who ate...

167
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,872
Dr. Edwards, when you're finished,
I need to talk to you in your office.

168
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,435
Wait for me there.

169
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,995
You're late?

170
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,232
Three weeks late.

171
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,073
-Could it be Phillip's?
-No.

172
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,513
That's impossible.

173
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,479
Algie, do you want to keep the child?

174
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,713
Yes.

175
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,520
Stop and think about it a little.

176
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,951
I don't need to think about it.

177
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,199
It's our child, Cornelia.

178
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,753
Keep your voice down.

179
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,915
Don't you?

180
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,155
I do.

181
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,479
And I wouldn't even hesitate to lie about
who the father is if only...

182
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,832
If only it wasn't a colored man.

183
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,240
Everyone will know when they see the child.

184
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,632
Does it...

185
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,551
Does it have to be a procedure?

186
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,678
Is there a medicine?

187
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,189
No.

188
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,271
A girl I knew at school said she heard
there was an old Indian remedy.

189
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,557
There's no proven method except surgery.

190
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,319
Edwards, stop right there.

191
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,358
I really haven't the time, Doctor.
If you'll kindly excuse me.

192
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,839
Edwards.

193
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,871
You cannot change treatment
on one of my patients

194
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,837
without my prior approval.

195
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,990
To do so is nothing less
than a breach of medical ethics.

196
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,389
-Which patient are you...
-Miss Gibson.

197
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,754
Which is she?

198
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,794
She's the woman who ingested
the so-called sanitized tapeworm

199
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,996
in order to slim her figure.

200
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,559
You cannot be serious.

201
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,596
-Do you remember her or not?
-Yes.

202
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,592
Yes, I remember her.
Miss Gibson, the rich, fat white lady.

203
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,352
-Edwards.
-I remember thinking,

204
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,238
"No one will ever make the mistake of
confusing her with the real Gibson Girl."

205
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,390
Don't walk away from me!

206
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,956
You prescribed castor oil as a purgative.

207
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,672
And what is wrong with that?

208
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,593
They have been prescribing castor oil
as an anthelmintic

209
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,114
since the time of the Egyptian pharaohs.

210
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,953
Eleanor?

211
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,717
Darling, what are you doing here?

212
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,631
Are you feeling all right?

213
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,873
I fear it's another brain fever.

214
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,232
Are you feeling ill?

215
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,596
No, it's the baby, Everett.
But never you mind.

216
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,029
I think you'll be proud of me.

217
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,272
I took a page from your book
and put its little head in an ice bath.

218
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,189
I don’t want to play in your yard

219
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,232
I don’t like you anymore

220
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,111
You’ll be sorry when you see me

221
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,990
Sliding down our cellar door

222
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,320
Don't stop.

223
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,550
You can’t holler down our rain barrel

224
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,314
You can’t climb our apple tree

225
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,997
I don’t want to play in your yard

226
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,670
If you won’t be good to me

227
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,073
Where'd you get this?

228
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,233
Barrow got it for you.

229
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,157
Salt water.

230
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,991
Now,

231
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,594
what can I do for you this afternoon?

232
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,436
I'm a friend of Dr. Thackery's.

233
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,958
I thought you might know
how to get the cocaine he needs.

234
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,310
It is difficult enough to acquire opium
for my customers here.

235
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,835
Please tell Dr. Thackery

236
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,552
sorry.

237
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,509
You have quite a dainty foot.

238
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,632
In Chinese, we say it is jin ping mei.

239
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,675
A golden lotus.

240
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,435
Here, I'll write it down for you.

241
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,992
During the act of passion,

242
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,879
a man's pleasure may
be enhanced immeasurably

243
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,159
by having his concubine
place her foot in his mouth.

244
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,638
Do this for me,

245
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,956
and I shall trade you

246
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,830
ten grains of opium

247
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,039
and

248
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,830
one hundred Yankee dollars.

249
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,473
You heard the news?

250
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,035
The whole hospital's in tears.

251
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,714
Two little girls in as many months.

252
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,713
If I was Everett, I don't know what I would do.

253
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,711
I suppose you'd find comfort in your faith.

254
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,994
Faith isn't always a comfort.

255
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,395
I've lost so many over the years.

256
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,952
God blesses every child, born and unborn,
with an immortal soul.

257
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,070
All I can do is pray for them,

258
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,550
especially the unbaptized ones,
wherever they may go.

259
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,310
Aren't they all allowed into heaven?

260
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,871
I just assumed.

261
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,479
But we can hope
that God, in His infinite mercy,

262
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,714
will one day still welcome them
into His eternal communion.

263
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,436
And may He do the same for me.

264
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,552
What have you got for me?

265
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,835
Lamb chops.
I thought you might be hungry.

266
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,193
Oh, Lucy, please
don't tell me you've come empty-handed.

267
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,674
What is it?

268
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,192
A few grains of opium.

269
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,117
How did you know where to get this?

270
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,230
Don't be angry,
but I followed you one night.

271
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,837
You got it from Ping Wu?

272
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,280
I'm sure he took quite a liking to you.

273
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,994
As long as you didn't have
to put your golden lotus

274
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,036
in his mouth to pay for it.

275
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,637
Could you grab that lamp and matches?

276
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,353
And light the lamp for me.

277
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,119
Just hold that over the flame.

278
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,752
Am I doing it right?

279
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,994
Just, uh, just hold it over here.

280
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,356
How did you pay for this?

281
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,319
My bicycle.

282
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,919
-Good morning, Dr. Edwards.
-Good morning.

283
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,592
Nurse.

284
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,433
I'm afraid it's just
the two of us on the ward today.

285
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,229
Oh. Well, doesn't appear to be anything
the pair of us can't handle.

286
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,228
Shall we?

287
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,913
Mr. Oates.

288
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,278
I want you to open your eyes for me.
And, please, don't be alarmed.

289
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,475
I'm a colored man.

290
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,269
Don't make any difference to me.

291
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,874
Doctor?

292
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,077
Patient presents
capsulocretaceous cataracts in both eyes.

293
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,388
I advise surgery.

294
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,799
Anesthetic?

295
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,235
In the absence of cocaine,
I'd recommend Holocaine.

296
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,512
Looks like we are meeting halfway.

297
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,670
It would seem so.

298
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,799
My father says
that's a sure sign of any good relationship.

299
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,072
I was just headed to see if
Dr. Thackery needed anything.

300
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,752
Hmm.

301
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,150
You've been awfully solicitous
of Dr. Thackery lately.

302
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,071
Should I be jealous?

303
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,396
What do you mean?

304
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,358
-No, I just...
-What did you think?

305
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,238
Nothing. Um...

306
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,629
Mr. Barrow is looking for you.

307
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,159
No, Sir, I did not say that.

308
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,958
And I do sympathize with your situation.

309
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,878
I just wish you'd show
a bit of sympathy for mine.

310
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,910
No, sir, I have not had that privilege.

311
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,194
Good bye.

312
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,668
Horse-trading?

313
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,638
The army's requisitioned the lot
from the German Hospital.

314
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,072
Waiting to arrange shipment
to the US military post at Havana Harbor.

315
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,914
They can't be persuaded to part
with a lousy hundred bindles or so?

316
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,753
- The army would never miss 'em.
- Not for love or money.

317
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,391
Well, that's the Germans for you.

318
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,756
Never been a race better
at squeezing the life out of a dime.

319
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,671
I thought that was the Jews.

320
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,198
Nice of you to grace us
with your presence this morning.

321
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,112
How's Dr. Thackery? Better?

322
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,556
No better.
The drugs you gave me were salt water.

323
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,553
-Can you get your money back?
-I don't think so.

324
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,312
Do you happen to speak any German?

325
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,879
-What?
-Nothing.

326
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,951
Go to work, Lucy.

327
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,634
It's going to be a very long day.

328
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,033
Dr. Thackery.
Always a pleasure.

329
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,074
What can I do for you today?

330
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,675
It's more a question of what
I can do for you.

331
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,678
I have agreed to accept your offer

332
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,996
to endorse Thackery's Rejuvenating Liniment.

333
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,549
Uh-huh.

334
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,078
I think you mean
Peter's Rejuvenating Liniment.

335
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,792
He's a fine doctor.

336
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,833
Natural-born salesman, too.

337
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,399
Can't you peddle two of them?

338
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,276
That ship has sailed, Doc.

339
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,033
In fact, it might be
the only ship that's sailed around here lately.

340
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,514
That damn war in the Philippines
has interrupted my supply of narcotics.

341
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,160
They're prohibitively expensive
if they can be found at all.

342
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,677
I venture to guess that's the reason
for your coming here today?

343
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,796
What's in this stuff anyway?

344
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,190
Oh, blackstrap and
whatever else I can find for an added kick.

345
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,794
-Cocaine?
-Would if I could find any.

346
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,308
Mr. Luff,

347
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,509
would you consider
giving me a small advance

348
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,189
in earnest of the day
when the war is over

349
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,397
and you can sell one of these
with my name on it?

350
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,872
I'm afraid I can't help you.

351
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,598
Well, then I'm afraid

352
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,556
I will be forced to go to your competition.

353
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,391
I'm afraid they won't help you either.

354
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,076
You see, in our line of work,
a man has to present to the customer

355
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,152
a convincing air of healthful vitality.

356
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,233
Not to mention trustworthiness
and incorruptibility.

357
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,869
Please, please, please, please.
I'll do anything.

358
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,157
Yes, that is exactly my point.

359
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,519
Now, if you'll unhand me, sir,

360
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,831
this moldy rogue
has some business to attend to.

361
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,114
Nurse. Nurse. Nurse!

362
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,878
I don't think I know you.

363
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,954
No, ma'am.

364
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,270
They sent me over
from the hospital's nursing school.

365
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,918
Surgical specialty.

366
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,673
Well, you should have come
to see me straightaway.

367
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,316
I'm Nurse Braun,
Superintendent of Nurses.

368
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,637
Nurse...

369
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,312
Thackery.

370
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,118
Welcome, Nurse Thackery.

371
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,916
Scrub in and report to Herr Dr. Schmidt
in the main surgery.

372
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,672
Where is that, ma'am?

373
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,672
The other end of this corridor on the left.

374
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,435
And where is the drug dispensary, ma'am,
in the event I'm asked to fetch something?

375
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,636
Across the hall from it.

376
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,073
Thank you, ma'am.

377
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,432
What do you think you are doing?

378
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,193
Dr. Schmidt asked me
to fetch him some supplies, ma'am.

379
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,635
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-What's under your cape? Show me.

380
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,950
I said remove your cape. Stop her!

381
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,789
Stop that woman!

382
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,078
Get undressed in there.

383
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,950
Do you want me to get completely undressed?

384
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,792
Yes, it's advisable.

385
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,789
Because I'll be bleeding?

386
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,032
The procedure is called
dilation and curettage.

387
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,036
The cervix is dilated

388
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:37,194
and an instrument called a curette
is inserted to remove the...

389
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,228
Tissue.

390
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,036
Will it hurt?

391
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,594
No, you'll be etherized.

392
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,959
Cover yourself with this.

393
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,279
Algie.

394
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,512
Algie.

395
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,997
Algie, why won't you look at me?

396
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,236
I can perform the procedure,
but I cannot perform it on you.

397
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,478
You have to.

398
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,234
Please.

399
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,075
I can't kill my own child.

400
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,030
What are the alternatives?

401
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,272
We could sail to Europe.

402
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,439
Liberia.

403
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,712
They're more tolerant there.

404
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,552
Europe? Liberia?

405
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,200
There's no place on earth
we can raise it, Algie.

406
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,998
-Shh.
-Are you insane?

407
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,677
We have no choice.

408
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,558
I'm sorry.

409
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,269
-I can't.
-Algie.

410
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,798
-Please.
-I can't.

411
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,228
Well done, Nurse Elkins.

412
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,712
Here, let me do it.

413
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,636
You're a resourceful girl.

414
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,152
You're the most

415
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,631
resourceful,

416
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,151
most wonderful,

417
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,319
beautiful girl

418
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,150
I have ever known.

419
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,996
Oh, you.

420
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,637
Wait, let's douse your sex with it.

421
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,108
No.

422
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,478
Let's douse yours.
