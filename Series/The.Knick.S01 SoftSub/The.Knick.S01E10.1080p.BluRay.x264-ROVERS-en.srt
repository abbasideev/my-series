1
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,559
Evening.

2
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,755
You?

3
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,909
You know, it would be nice

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,993
if for just once in my life
a lady wasn't disappointed to see me.

5
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,198
Climb in the back.

6
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,992
Is it much further?

7
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,916
We'll be there in no time.

8
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,229
I'd like to know
exactly where it is we're going.

9
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,958
I'm not gonna say.

10
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,116
Don't you worry. It's safe.

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,191
None of your fancy society types

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,431
will be taking an evening stroll
anywhere nearby.

13
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,629
But it wouldn't matter.

14
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,317
I've had more than my fair share
of your type needing my services.

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,072
Makes sense.

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,513
In what way?

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,395
Well, matters of the flesh.

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,274
Don't really matter
how fancy the table is you're sitting at,

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,152
everyone gets hungry.

20
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,072
With the amount of time
you rich ladies spend making yourself pretty,

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,436
it's no surprise
someone wanted to put that to good use.

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,637
Men, they want what they want
when they want it.

23
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,633
Then you all come to Cleary for the fix.

24
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,590
You promised it wasn't you who'd perform it.

25
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,950
You can relax. It ain't me.

26
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,719
It's better.

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,951
This ain't the place
for joking, Cleary.

28
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,076
It ain't no joke, I swear.

29
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,799
She's a paying customer like all the rest.

30
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,029
You're the...

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,709
Yes, I'm the one who does it.

32
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,598
You don't want this rhinoceros doing it,
do you?

33
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,079
But you're...

34
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,516
And you're a pretty, proper virgin
on the cusp of her wedding day.

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,317
We're friends, Harry.

36
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,071
You could have told me.

37
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,153
So could you.

38
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,433
But then neither of us could, could we?

39
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,835
This is where you leave, Tom.

40
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,229
Ah!

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,555
Could have done without him
in the middle of this.

42
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,756
Never wanted him there in the first place.

43
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,236
You don't have to do this.

44
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,188
Yes, I do.

45
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,157
You'll be married soon.

46
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,389
You can tell anyone who can count to nine
that it happened on your wedding night.

47
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,391
I'll be your midwife
and vouch for the baby coming early.

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,040
No, this has to happen here tonight.

49
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,077
I can only find the courage to ask for this
just so many times.

50
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,718
At least talk to Phillip about it.

51
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,510
He may see things differently.

52
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,549
I'll get you through it as quick as I can,
little daughter.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,991
A tumor has amassed
at the base of the skull

54
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,152
which is the cause
of the patient's terrible pain.

55
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,912
By trepanning,

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,753
I hope to relieve some of that pressure.

57
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,638
As you can see, my assessment is correct.

58
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,596
As the brain's fluid is immediately
being forced out through the opening.

59
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,908
Synnge.

60
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,717
In order to keep
the intracranial pressure at bay,

61
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,952
it is my opinion

62
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,068
that the hole I've just created
should remain open

63
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,917
even after the operation.

64
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,909
And now on to the tumor.

65
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,199
Surgical knife.

66
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,793
This is our surgical preparation room.

67
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,999
Good afternoon, doctors.

68
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,117
Good afternoon, Dr. Zinberg.
Taking a tour of our old gal?

69
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,636
She's been through quite a few battles,
but we've managed to keep her afloat.

70
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,711
Isn't that right, Thack?

71
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,029
Dr. Zinberg is making the rounds
at all of the city's hospitals.

72
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,873
He's hoping to promote greater cooperation
between the surgeons.

73
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,915
Curiously, I found our New York brethren
much less willing

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,389
than my previous ones in Chicago.

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,150
Well, I think that's changing, thanks to you.

76
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,753
My father and I recently sat in

77
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,469
on the pulmonary abscess procedure you did
on your last visit to New York Hospital.

78
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,674
He used what looked like this impossible
suture of both layers of the parietal.

79
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,995
It was very, very impressive.

80
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,637
Dr. Zinberg has agreed
to perform a surgery for us here at the Knick.

81
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,114
Really?

82
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,909
Who invited him?

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,389
Mr. Habershorn from the board.

84
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,473
Seems they've heard wonderful things
from Dr. Zinberg's patron, Mr. Loeb,

85
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,232
and wanted us to see for ourselves.

86
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,235
Well, you must remind me
to send Mr. Habershorn a note.

87
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,118
Well, you'll be a hard act to follow,
Dr. Thackery.

88
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,352
Your choice of leaving the skull open
is...intriguing.

89
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,914
I've always been a believer in osteoplasty,

90
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,435
but this contradicts that.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,912
Well, naturally,
there are foreseeable complications.

92
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,358
I'd like to try it out on my next tumor patient.

93
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,032
Modify it.

94
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,509
Perhaps we can share our findings.

95
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,272
If that's all right with you, of course.

96
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,476
No, it's not.

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,468
Physicians and other disciplines believe

98
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,836
the mind is not a place
where sickness can fester,

99
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,876
but I assure you it can.

100
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,513
This way, please.

101
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,319
Disorders of the mind
must not be treated casually.

102
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,393
Indeed, we must be aggressive
if our patients are to improve.

103
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,351
Of course, Dr. Cotton.

104
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,434
Step in.

105
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,757
I'm grateful for you taking on my wife.

106
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,755
Well, it came at the request of our teacher
Dr. Meyer at Johns Hopkins.

107
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,035
There's no man I more admire.

108
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,749
-Henry.
-Huh?

109
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,593
Whatever the cost,
our families are willing to pay it.

110
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,398
I want the best possible care for Eleanor.

111
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,597
Oh. Well, she's receiving it.

112
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,829
Please.

113
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,480
Eleanor, you have a visitor.

114
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,679
Hello, sweetheart.

115
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,428
Eleanor.

116
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,796
Eleanor, it's me, Everett.

117
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,396
-Everett.
-In God's name...

118
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,754
What in the hell happened?

119
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,956
It's all part of the treatment.

120
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,792
-We pulled all of her teeth.
-Why?

121
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,518
My research has shown conclusively

122
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,798
that all mental disorders stem from disease
and infection polluting the brain.

123
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,639
So, the teeth and gums
are havens for bacteria and sepsis.

124
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,030
Thus, to cure the patient,
we must rid the body of all sites of infection.

125
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,599
But her teeth?
She is a beautiful woman.

126
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,517
Who has gone mad.

127
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,069
Now, you must see this as a kindness.
Her teeth had to go.

128
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,592
I believe in this treatment so strongly

129
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,912
that I have removed my own children's teeth
as a preventative measure.

130
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,472
So this is common practice?

131
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,755
It is not generally accepted.

132
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,909
My colleagues thus far
choose to remain in the Dark Ages,

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,356
but I'm confident when my results come in,
they'll soon adopt my technique.

134
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,271
Then it's been effective?

135
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,349
Not as yet.

136
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,115
But we've only begun
to attack the sites of infection.

137
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,354
I think her tonsils and adenoids
will have to come out.

138
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,716
And if that fails to bring improvement,
her colon will have to go as well.

139
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,708
Fuck. Fuck.

140
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,949
Jesus.

141
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,993
Get off him, Junia.

142
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,149
Fuck.

143
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,476
That's more than I expected from you, Herm.

144
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,268
But what I got in my pocket
is less than I expected from you.

145
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,792
You missed a payment again.

146
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,235
I thought after the favor I did you
at the hospital...

147
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,072
You don't miss a payment!

148
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,833
I made that clear, you dim fuck.

149
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,270
And then you come to my place
and blow money on whores?

150
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,795
I just wanted to see my girl.

151
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,359
She's my girl.

152
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,554
They're all my girls!

153
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,673
And that was my money
you spent to plug my girl.

154
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,358
Show him a blue burner, Jimmy.

155
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,839
- No, no, no, no.
- Take 'em away!

156
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,038
Or I'll give you 10 like you won't forget.

157
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,075
Please.

158
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,195
Oh, fuck.

159
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,232
Nothing breaks a man like a good cock punch.

160
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,670
Seen it kill a fellow once.

161
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,674
Your change purse seems to be holding
its own, though, Herm.

162
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,750
But it's swelling.
To the size of a billposter's bucket.

163
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,670
I'm tacking on a grand for being late

164
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,517
and doubling your rate
for it being a repeated offense.

165
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,398
I'll get some ice.

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,276
Stir that gravy, Duchess.
Don't want the sugar in there to candy up.

167
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,435
Yes, ma'am.

168
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,592
Joella, take that turkey out,
but don't carve it yet.

169
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,636
That meat needs to rest.

170
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,034
Algie, you come to help your mama?

171
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,628
Oh, I'd only get in the way.

172
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,869
Don't let him fool you, girls.

173
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,315
This boy can cook
as good as his mama taught him to.

174
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,995
Glazes a ham better
than any of them chefs over in Paris.

175
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,270
Thought I'd come by a little early
for the lunch today.

176
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,628
ls Cornelia out of her room yet?

177
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,797
Woke up feeling bad.
Been sitting in the parlor.

178
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,348
Girl has the wedding jitters if you ask me.

179
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,589
I'll check on her.

180
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,557
Always so considerate.

181
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,918
No one can see in.

182
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,798
They can all see in.

183
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,479
Are you...

184
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,392
Are you all right?

185
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,599
It's done.

186
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,118
Was it terrible?

187
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,958
It was our child.

188
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,633
I wanted to be there with you. I did.

189
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,278
But I couldn't.

190
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,313
You understand?

191
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,631
I think we made a mistake.

192
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,434
Yes, our affair was the mistake.

193
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,555
No.

194
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,915
You were looking for a risk to take
and I just happened to be it.

195
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,514
-No, that is not true.
-That is true.

196
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,949
Now we are living with the consequences
of that.

197
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,554
And we should be grateful

198
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,677
to have escaped with our skin.

199
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,159
Now we have to be realistic.

200
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,468
I don't want to be realistic.

201
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,154
You never have wanted to be realistic.

202
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,037
You will marry Phillip.

203
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,915
He's a good man

204
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,151
and the two of you will have
many splendid, healthy children together.

205
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,593
And this...

206
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,755
All of this mess will barely be a memory.

207
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,592
No.

208
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,398
I don't think I should
attend the luncheon today.

209
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,869
Please convey my regrets.

210
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,518
In front of you is a man, age 32,

211
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,990
suffering from splenic anemia.

212
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,274
Now this is evident
in the slight green coloration of the skin.

213
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,711
This disease is rare, insidious,

214
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,873
and up until now
prognosis was anything but hopeful.

215
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,633
Unfortunately, gentlemen,

216
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,555
it is only too true that the entire subject
of blood making and blood breaking

217
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,030
is as yet very imperfectly understood.

218
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,198
But I believe

219
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,034
the answer lies
right in the name of the disease itself.

220
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,594
The spleen.

221
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,717
I thought
you were at lunch at the Robertsons'.

222
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,995
This seemed more interesting.

223
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,835
Where are the atomizers?

224
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,751
He doesn't use them.

225
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,479
He says they're as modern as dinosaurs.

226
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,551
I am now going to separate the spleen
from the splenic artery.

227
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,720
Suction. More clamps, if you please.

228
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,433
We are through.

229
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,118
The patient still has a long road
of convalescing ahead of him.

230
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,753
And we have a long road ahead of us

231
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,958
in fully understanding this disease
and how our blood behaves.

232
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,432
However, we may not be as far off
as we once believed.

233
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,517
My distinguished colleague
Dr. Karl Landsteiner of Vienna

234
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,989
and I have been working together.

235
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,516
And if our experiments
continue to prove successful,

236
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,273
we will soon propose to you, gentlemen,

237
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,272
that we are not of all the same blood,

238
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,793
but, in fact,

239
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,200
of three distinct bloods.

240
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,991
The question is
why do transfusions fail?

241
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,434
Multiple reasons.

242
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,111
The principle being that the transfused blood
begins clotting in the new body,

243
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,918
immediately killing the recipient.

244
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,310
And that is where
we'll start unlocking the mystery.

245
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,356
I'll need both your bloods.

246
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,069
For what purpose?

247
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,194
For the purpose of beating Zinberg and
not allowing him to bask in another triumph.

248
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,236
This is one of the main focuses
of his research.

249
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,629
He's already around the track
and we are at the starting line.

250
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,393
Look, the man upstaged us
at the medical conference.

251
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,110
Our exceptional hernia presentation
had to play second fiddle to his gadget.

252
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,395
He then arrives at our theater
acting all innocent

253
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,349
when it is clear that his only intention
is to spy and to steal.

254
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,758
There is a difference between
wishing to learn and collaborate

255
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,990
and looking to steal another man's work.

256
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,832
Zinberg is a thief!

257
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,799
He's a fake.

258
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,795
He steals other people's work
and he passes it off as his own.

259
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,872
And I am not allowing him to do it again.

260
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,713
From now on, this will be my main focus.

261
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,511
Beginning today, Dr. Edwards,

262
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,752
you will take the lead in all surgeries
while I concentrate on this.

263
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,628
Um...

264
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,709
Until when?

265
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,836
Until we win one of those new Nobel Prizes.

266
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,079
Dr. Thackery.

267
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,153
Dr. Thackery.

268
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,391
You need to take a moment
and consider yourself.

269
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,953
You are, if I may say, acting irrationally.
And I...

270
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,318
I think the cause may be more pharmaceutical
in nature than you realize.

271
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,678
I did not ask what you think.

272
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,479
I told you what to do.

273
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,158
-Bertie.
-Yes?

274
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,559
Come here.

275
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,995
You much of a bleeder?

276
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,878
-I don't believe so.
-Hold still.

277
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,075
Okay.

278
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,954
Oh! OW!

279
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,109
Yes.

280
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,878
I'm gonna need you for a special assignment.

281
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,029
Okay.

282
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,157
You've got to find out everything you can
about Zinberg.

283
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,556
What he's doing,
how far along he is in his research.

284
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,629
How?

285
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,200
Well, he's a man who believes in sharing.

286
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,872
Test that theory.

287
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,469
I need to speak with you urgently.

288
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,428
In private.

289
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,910
I want you to introduce me to your Chinaman.

290
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,353
Who?

291
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,910
The one they brought in here
after you saved his life.

292
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,594
I need you to call in the favor he owes you.

293
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,159
Why? For what?

294
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,149
I want him to kill Bunky Collier for me.

295
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,955
What are you talking about?

296
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,634
You have to ask him for me.

297
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,358
I have no choice.

298
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,511
What is this? What have...

299
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,114
What have you gotten yourself into?

300
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,439
I owe him.

301
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,436
I owe him nearly $10,000
and it's growing every day.

302
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,954
Every minute that we stand here,

303
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,192
I'm incurring more debt
than any man could fairly pay in a lifetime.

304
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,839
And you want me to ask a favor of Ping Wu?

305
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,870
You're talking about
bargaining with the devil, Herman.

306
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,111
You know,
Wu is not a man to get involved with.

307
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,514
He doesn't believe he can die.

308
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,515
And from the scars on him,
he might be telling the truth.

309
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,792
Oh...

310
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,990
-It's lovely.
-Thank you.

311
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,109
Ivory?

312
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,476
Yes, it's carved from the tusk
of the elephant Frederick

313
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,551
shot on safari last year.

314
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,430
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

315
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,151
Perfectly exquisite.

316
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,757
And now for something old.

317
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,749
Eunice.

318
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,950
Oh, they're stunning.

319
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,552
They belonged to Hobart's mother,

320
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,870
Phillip's grandmother.

321
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,713
It was Hobart who thought
you'd look beautiful in them.

322
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,279
Thank you.

323
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,519
Use them well.

324
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,354
I Will.

325
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,468
Everett.

326
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,834
Everett.

327
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,629
What the hell?

328
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,678
Gentlemen! Gentlemen, stop this right now!

329
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,631
What is going on here?

330
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,394
He attacked me!

331
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,869
-You destroyed my life!
-You destroyed yourself.

332
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,473
Dr. Gallinger,

333
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,959
you are suspended from service
until you straighten yourself out.

334
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,594
Everett.

335
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,068
Everett.

336
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,754
-For God's sake, man...
-John, you gave up on me.

337
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,990
Edwards was not my hire.
You were my choice.

338
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,908
And if you had to make that choice again,
would I still be it?

339
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,635
I didn't think so.

340
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,110
Take some time. Go home, collect yourself.

341
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,919
Come back a new man
who can give Edwards a run for his money.

342
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,558
Go home to what?

343
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,118
You were all I had left. Now look at you.

344
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,316
Don't you look antiseptic.

345
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,233
Perhaps you can complete your task
by sneezing into my patient.

346
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,869
Earlier, you spoke of the coagulation problem
in transfusion.

347
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,076
Now it's been accepted into fact

348
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,755
that normal blood
takes 9.28 minutes to coagulate.

349
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,310
You are conversing with me
about your experiments now?

350
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,789
How much more evidence
of your absurd behavior do you need?

351
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,633
I am on to something that cannot wait.

352
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,156
So normal blood
takes 9.28 minutes to coagulate,

353
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,630
but if you administer citric acid,
then that time increases.

354
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,191
That could mean that each individual
has varying levels of citric acid in their blood

355
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,474
which we have yet to discover.

356
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,189
Yes, but the coagulation time also increases
with certain diseases.

357
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,875
Tuberculosis or leukemia, for example.
And decreases with others.

358
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,837
How do you explain that, then?

359
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,638
Silk suture, please.

360
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,472
I want blood samples
from everyone on the ward.

361
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,032
Not the patients.
The nurses and the orderlies.

362
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,516
I'm glad you contacted me, Dr. Chickering.

363
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,388
Well, my father's been after me
about it for a while now.

364
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,836
Well, he only wants a good situation for you.

365
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,473
And I have that with Thackery.

366
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,597
Yet here you sit.

367
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,958
I won't take a pupil from his mentor,
despite your father's request that I do so.

368
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,508
Well, he doesn't quite understand.

369
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,470
Dr. Thackery must be a good man

370
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,075
and an excellent influence
for you to have such loyalty.

371
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,028
I wanted to collaborate with Thackery.

372
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,355
Your brain surgery, our blood work.

373
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,034
Your hernia and previa procedures,
our endoscope.

374
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,954
We could have been excellent partners.

375
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,759
I don't think Thackery believed
you were being sincere.

376
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,433
I only want to solve problems
and help people.

377
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,351
I'm sure Dr. Thackery feels similarly.

378
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,595
Of course.

379
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,995
We're close on the blood types.

380
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,755
We're learning more every day.

381
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,071
Imagine being able to safely transfuse.

382
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,109
The lives saved. But we're stuck.

383
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,753
The final hurdle is proving harder to negotiate
than we imagined.

384
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,593
What's this?

385
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,034
It's what I was going to present
to the next society meeting.

386
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,317
It's what we have so far.

387
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,073
Call it a show of good faith.

388
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,632
I'm not concerned with who figures it out
as long as it gets solved.

389
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,475
Oh.

390
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,915
I don't know what to say.

391
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,149
Say you'll help us.

392
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,114
If Thackery agrees to collaborate,
put our minds together and find the answer,

393
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,030
the documents are his.

394
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,394
If not...

395
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,469
I will trust you to do with them
what you think is right.

396
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,751
Why did Thackery not come?

397
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,237
Why did he send you?

398
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,635
Do you mind if we speak alone?

399
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,635
This is not an average request.

400
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,717
Thackery works for me.

401
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,279
And I need to protect him.

402
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,593
And if this goes wrong,
it can't lead back to him.

403
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,470
That's why I'm here instead.

404
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,838
What does he want?

405
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,359
To have you make good on your debt to him
for saving your life.

406
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,235
He owes a great deal of money

407
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,232
to Bunky Collier.

408
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,316
And Collier's threatened Thack's life.

409
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,432
Abused him terribly.

410
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,078
He's beaten him,

411
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,518
humiliated him,

412
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,190
and dealt with him unfairly.

413
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,277
He wants Collier dead.

414
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,518
He said that? His words?

415
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,868
Are you sure that's what he wants?

416
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,475
Very.

417
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,711
Let me take you home.

418
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,279
We can sleep and see
how it looks to you in the morning.

419
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,191
No. He's too far ahead.

420
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,397
He could be getting ready
to publish next week.

421
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,632
Would you fetch me
some of my medicine, please?

422
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,309
What?

423
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,710
I don't like what it's doing to you.

424
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,798
I don't care what you like.

425
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,553
I need to work. I need to concentrate.

426
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,915
So, please, just do as you're told.

427
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,356
-John...
-Now, Nurse Elkins.

428
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,069
You see what it's doing to him?

429
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,829
I do.

430
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,672
Then leave it here.

431
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,355
-Let him go without it.
-I can't.

432
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,035
You haven't seen the alternative.

433
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,269
I have.

434
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,032
It's much worse.

435
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,119
Excuse me.

436
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,709
Neely, I told him.

437
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,793
I told Phillip if he presented San Francisco
as a fait accompli, you would

438
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,669
feel the way you're feeling now.

439
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,072
-What are you going to do?
-What do you mean?

440
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,230
Are you getting married tomorrow?

441
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,309
I have to.

442
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,998
Neely, doll. You're a Robertson.

443
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,229
There are ways.

444
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,995
Can we talk about you, please?

445
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,712
How are you?

446
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,552
How's San Francisco?

447
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,269
I don't know if you've noticed,

448
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,838
but Dad isn't...

449
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,428
Isn't Dad anymore.

450
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,193
He's not...

451
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,473
Not the same.

452
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,997
Has something happened between you two?

453
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,708
No. No, I'm talking about the business.

454
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,159
When I arrived in San Francisco,

455
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,232
things were a mess.

456
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,552
I spent most of the last year

457
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,552
trying to renegotiate
some of the deals he made.

458
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,870
They would have proved fatal to the company
if l hadn't

459
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,635
If that's true, it makes me sad.

460
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,108
Me, too.

461
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,959
Oh! Good morning, miss.
I didn't expect to find you awake.

462
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,678
Couldn't sleep.

463
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,796
-It is a big day.
-Yes.

464
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,878
After you, sir.

465
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,029
Everything you could ever want.

466
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,075
-Morning, Harry.
-Thomas.

467
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,628
Lot of good stuff in these Sears catalogs.

468
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,558
You get pianos, headstones, ovens.

469
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,396
-You looking for anything?
-What do you mean?

470
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,677
Something for yourself.
Something nice like you always wanted.

471
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,752
Like a fancy table clock

472
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,434
or a repeating rifle.

473
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,511
Why on Earth would I want a rifle?

474
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,113
Bears.

475
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,111
-Here?
-It was in the papers.

476
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,354
Pet shop man lost his
out of his front yard in Brooklyn last week.

477
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,113
Attacked a granny and the postman
before they took it down.

478
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,668
Thank you for your kindly offer,
but I'll be fine.

479
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,991
Me, I'm thinking about getting
one of these fancy new automobiles.

480
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,399
Learning to drive it proper.

481
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,153
Only $495.

482
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,791
Hah! Says in here all you need is
an electric plug and a... What was it?

483
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,075
-Desire.
-Desire for adventure.

484
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,989
Can you picture me
piloting one of them around the city?

485
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,474
Imagine all the escaped bears you could find.

486
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,676
I must be going. Enjoy your daydreaming.

487
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,356
Ah! Dreaming is for blokes
not smart enough to get what they want.

488
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,556
-Have fun at today's big event.
-Cleary.

489
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,235
Please give Mrs. Robertson
my deepest appreciations.

490
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,312
We are all blessed to know her this fine day.

491
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,313
Bertie the Wise.

492
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,038
You saw Zinberg?

493
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,709
I did.

494
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,592
-You have information for me?
-I do.

495
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,999
Hold that thought, Dr. Chickering,

496
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,470
because I, as of 6:41 this morning,
have solved this rotten riddle.

497
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,309
See, I at first thought the answer
lay in the blood's coagulability,

498
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,551
but Dr. Edwards showed me
the error of my thinking.

499
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,710
I then began to hypothesize

500
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,509
that the number of red blood cells
per cubic millimeter is what differentiates us.

501
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,117
But as we know, that number
can fluctuate for multiple reasons.

502
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,514
Sickness, altitude...

503
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,830
And aren't there around
six million blood cells per cubic millimeter?

504
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,035
Exactly.

505
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,154
And as I was about 9,000 cells into a count
of one of my samples, I found something.

506
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,708
It's not the number, it's the size.

507
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,796
In some cases,

508
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,236
there were 75% that were 7.5 microns.

509
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,436
In others, it was only 25%.

510
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,719
I studied sample after sample.

511
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,759
And then a beautiful pattern emerged.

512
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,198
Come, take a look.

513
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,789
Come.

514
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,869
Come.

515
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,639
See, this is the group
that was 75% at 7.5 microns.

516
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,469
Look.

517
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,077
Okay, this one is 60%.

518
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,718
Look.

519
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,239
This was 42.

520
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,793
Twenty-five.

521
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,598
And finally, 18%.

522
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,879
Zinberg was wrong.

523
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,713
It's not three types, it's actually five.

524
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,233
Do you see?

525
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,833
Honestly, no.

526
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,231
It's there, damn it.

527
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,995
I know it's a Sunday, but that's no reason
to leave your brain in bed.

528
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,878
Come on and wake up. Wake up. Look again.

529
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,193
I doubt even the great Zinberg
will have reached that conclusion.

530
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,349
Has he?

531
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,076
Your look tells me he has.

532
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,078
No, he has not.

533
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,158
So we have won.

534
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,510
What he's found is remarkable.

535
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,630
And he's open to sharing it.

536
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,348
I think he's quite sincere
in his pledge to collaborate,

537
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,875
and if you would just be willing to share...

538
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,114
Oh, and let him gain the glory
on the backs of our ingenuity?

539
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,668
-I honestly do not think that is his intention.
-No, we will be first!

540
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,194
And we will be first without him!

541
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,472
Were you followed?

542
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,748
Followed?

543
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,792
No. What do you mean?

544
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,672
He's got, you know, people, spies everywhere.

545
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,913
Maybe you're one of them.

546
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,870
Thack, I am no such thing.

547
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,918
And I think you need rest.

548
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,397
All right, you can go.

549
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,436
Did he enlist you in this?

550
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,353
I volunteered.

551
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,632
Can you still do what I asked?

552
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,392
It's all arranged.

553
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,873
She's perfect.

554
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,075
Her anemic condition
was brought about by chlorosis.

555
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:25,278
They've tried arsenic, bone marrow,
hydrotherapy. Nothing's worked.

556
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,355
Maybe we shouldn't interfere.

557
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,151
The patient is sick enough. It seems cruel.

558
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,312
She's got nothing else.
Let's give her a chance.

559
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,751
A transfusion of blood
may be just what's needed.

560
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,914
Well...

561
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,114
This is certainly your lucky day.

562
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,678
When you wake up,

563
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,952
you'll be cured.

564
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,519
Nurse Elkins.

565
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,919
Blood is flowing.

566
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,518
Pulse is rapid.

567
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,595
Pulse is erratic.

568
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,995
Pulse is weakening.

569
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,434
- What's happening?
- It's not working.

570
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,708
I have no pulse.

571
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,189
Fuck.

572
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,629
John.

573
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,598
What have I done?

574
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,750
Excuse me. Excuse me.

575
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,759
Excuse me.

576
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,271
Bertie. Excuse me.

577
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,560
-Bertie.
-Lucy, what's wrong?

578
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,200
It's Dr. Thackery.

579
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,832
Congratulations, mate!

580
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,308
Thackery.

581
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,789
John.

582
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,555
John.

583
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,112
John, it's the drug.

584
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,399
It's destroying you.

585
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,715
John.

586
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,239
You need to stop.

587
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,594
I can't.

588
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,196
-John.
-I can't stop.

589
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,030
We'll find someone who can help you.

590
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,756
Right, Bertie?

591
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,878
So it's all true, then?

592
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,313
I'm sorry.

593
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,353
I'm sorry.

594
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,428
Dear God.

595
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,759
-Bertie.
-What?

596
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,109
Please.

597
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,953
I don't know what to do.

598
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,837
You think I know what to do
with this madness?

599
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,913
Please, Bertie.

600
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,309
Whoa.

601
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,593
Mr. Cleary?

602
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,948
-That's me.
-Got something for you.

603
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,068
Thank you.

604
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,272
Sit him up, please.

605
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,471
How much cocaine
have you injected today, doctor?

606
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,199
Twelve grams.

607
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,311
That's quite a tolerance.

608
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,868
You've seen people in his condition before?

609
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,872
In my practice, more than a bit these days.

610
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,397
Women of a certain breeding
who have become dependent on the drug.

611
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,232
Can you help him?

612
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,392
In the meantime,

613
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,117
keep him comfortable.

614
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,676
Your man is no more.

615
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,588
He wasn't my man, Mr. Ping.

616
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,353
He was causing Thackery the trouble,
remember?

617
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,518
His request.

618
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,275
And I am sure he'll be grateful
you came by to let us know.

619
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,588
I've known Thackery a long time.

620
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,353
He loves my woman, my opium.

621
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,071
He always pays.

622
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,039
But you...

623
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,511
Where did you get that?

624
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,592
From Collier's desk.

625
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,149
A man who owes me $9,000
as long as you owe Collier

626
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,798
would be fed to my pigs.

627
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,071
That book is not...

628
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,435
I can read left to right,

629
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,117
not just up and down.

630
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,235
This

631
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,752
my book now.

632
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,798
I was so close.

633
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,195
What?

634
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,431
What did you just say?

635
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,231
I was so close with that girl.

636
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,918
No, you weren't.

637
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,115
I read Zinberg's papers.

638
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,356
There's nothing to do
with the size of the blood cells.

639
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,670
It has to do with the agglutinating antibodies.

640
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,832
Certain people have one type, others another.

641
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,831
You were off by a mile.

642
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,519
Hello.

643
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,828
Dr. Chickering.

644
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,992
I believe Dr. Hackett is expecting us.

645
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,674
Would you empty your pockets, please?

646
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,789
Is there someone you would like to list
as the next of kin?

647
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,351
There's nothing
you can do for him now.

648
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,316
There's no use in sitting there
worrying about him.

649
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,955
Perhaps you could advance us the drugs

650
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,430
and we could pay you
once we've charged the patients.

651
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,397
Your patients can't pay.

652
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,278
This has always been the Church's issue
with the Knick.

653
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,351
Your policies create dependency.

654
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,271
Why would they advance us anything?

655
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,237
Our chief surgeon is gone.

656
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,276
His predecessor killed himself.

657
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,909
And the only man left here with a scalpel
is a Negro.

658
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,070
But there is a solution.

659
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,628
Same one we've had all along.

660
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,154
Close the Knick and move uptown.

661
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,718
The decision has to be made now.

662
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,190
Metropolitan Hospital has made an offer
for my land uptown.

663
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,714
I can't hold it for us any longer.

664
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,594
In light of all that's happened here,

665
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,397
I think it's time we bring this matter to a vote.

666
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,470
All in favor of shuttering this place

667
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,710
and moving the Knick uptown?

668
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,548
Aye.

669
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,028
Then...

670
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,073
it's decided.

671
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,310
Welcome to Cromartie Hospital.

672
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,310
I'm Dr. Hackett.

673
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,233
When Dr. Chickering Sr.
called ahead on your behalf,

674
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,871
he asked that you be registered under an alias
to protect your privacy.

675
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,355
Is there a name that you prefer?

676
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,633
Crutchfield.

677
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,039
Excellent.

678
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,832
Favorite teacher?

679
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,273
My mother.

680
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,071
You have been
steered to the right place.

681
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,479
Thank you.

682
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,390
As our reputation has grown,

683
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,950
we've begun to specialize
in treating cocaine madness.

684
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:27,758
The withdrawal of the drug from your system
will be the hardest part.

685
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,554
Well, from the looks of you,

686
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,632
you've done enough damage
to yourself already.

687
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,797
We here at Cromartie Hospital
believe that the pain

688
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,711
of detoxification

689
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,075
is counterproductive to restoring your health.

690
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:56,075
So we have developed a series of treatments
designed to ease your suffering.

691
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,869
Including a miraculous medication

692
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,196
that can virtually eliminate
the misery of withdrawal.

693
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,958
And don't worry.

694
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,034
It's from Bayer,

695
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,236
the aspirin company.

696
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,878
Safe as can be.

697
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,232
Rest assured, these treatments
will only be for the first month or two.

698
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,550
Time to start getting better.
