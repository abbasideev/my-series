1
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,116
I'm looking for Dr. John Thackery.

2
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,031
I believe he's a surgeon here.

3
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,910
Dr. Thackery's Office is on the second floor
on the west side Of the...

4
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,793
...building.

5
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,831
I'll have someone from surgical services
take you to him.

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,359
Thank you.

7
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,399
Dr. Thackery,
there is a Mrs. Alford here to see you.

8
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,550
I'm not expecting anyone.

9
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,596
I think she might be a patient.

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,719
Then tell her to make
an appointment with Gallinger

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,037
and if it merits my attention,
I'm sure he'll let me know.

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,072
She says she's a friend.

13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,039
I assure you that my social circle

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,795
is sufficiently small that I would know anyone

15
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,872
foolish enough
to call themselves any such thing.

16
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,190
Should I send her away?

17
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,953
Abby?

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,678
Hello, John.

19
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,435
Alford...

20
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,678
I didn't recognize the name.

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,033
Your husband's?

22
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,110
Wherever he may be.

23
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,950
It's good to see you.

24
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,030
No one handles the unexpected
like John Thackery.

25
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,751
It's where I live.

26
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,436
Thank you, Nurse Elkins.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,355
Please, take a seat.

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,394
I didn't know how else to go about this.

29
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,399
-I thought of writing a letter first.
-No, no, no, it's fine.

30
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,392
You're here now.

31
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,757
In all my splendor.

32
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,154
I suppose you can surmise
why I've come to you.

33
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,111
Of course.

34
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,196
Please don't be uncomfortable.

35
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,918
This is something I'm very used to.

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,154
In all the time we were together,

37
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,113
I could never get used to
what you called normal.

38
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,799
I suppose it's only fair, as you could never
get used to what everyone else called normal.

39
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,555
Well, Mrs. Alford,

40
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,873
let me take a look at you
and see what remedies I can offer.

41
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,153
Wait.

42
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,918
The light.

43
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,957
Of course.

44
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,197
Thank you.

45
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,032
My eyes can't bear it.

46
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,793
No, no. It's a common symptom.

47
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,190
Is the light still too much?

48
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,151
No. No.

49
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,117
I wouldn't blame you for wondering.

50
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,236
I'm not. Hold still.

51
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,636
I've only been with two men in my life,

52
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,870
you and my husband.

53
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,389
It was my husband.

54
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,678
What's past is past.

55
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,157
I'd really prefer not to get into it.

56
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,392
He didn't have it when I first met him.
It happened later.

57
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,199
With a girl in his office.

58
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,430
You've got good capillaries on the bridge
and healthy skin on the edges.

59
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,556
Apparently, she had it.

60
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,038
You know, Abby,
you owe me no explanations.

61
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,030
Everyone out there can stare
and think what they want,

62
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,633
but I need you to understand.

63
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,233
Please, John.

64
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,913
Very well.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,752
Hold still.

66
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,598
So...

67
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,435
It was a girl in his office?

68
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,389
She knew she had it.

69
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,069
She was too embarrassed to say anything.

70
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,511
She wasn't too embarrassed
to have sex with my husband,

71
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,670
but telling him
that she was a syphilitic whore,

72
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,756
well, that was more than she could bear.

73
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,472
You know, from what I recall,

74
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,111
you chose him

75
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,794
because you wanted more calm
than I could give you.

76
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,273
It wasn't that simple.

77
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,831
Nothing with you ever was.

78
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,636
You were exciting and brilliant.

79
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,875
I couldn't have loved you more.

80
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,632
I was so proud to be on your arm.

81
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,233
Most times when we were together,

82
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,474
I felt like I was taking
the best bite of the plum.

83
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,876
It was the rest of it.

84
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,356
I just didn't need the chaos as much as you.

85
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,753
The rides in Coney Island
are great fun once in a while,

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,831
but not every day.

87
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,918
Those rides were tame compared to you.

88
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,830
I had to choose
between two men who loved me.

89
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,750
A situation I most certainly
will never find myself in again.

90
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,355
We can put your apparatus back on.

91
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,230
You're a good candidate for restoration,
but it won't be an easy go.

92
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,397
Very little has been.

93
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,038
How does it work?

94
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,873
Well,

95
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,830
the surgeon selects a piece of skin
from your arm here.

96
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,792
He then makes a flap
which stays partially fixed to your arm

97
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,359
to keep the skin alive

98
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,472
and provide blood flow from that end.

99
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,313
He then attaches the other end of the flap
to the bridge of your nose,

100
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,871
attempting as best he can
to connect a good blood supply.

101
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,395
A harness is then put in place
for several weeks

102
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,994
to ensure that the arm
doesn't come away from the face

103
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,031
and put stress on the connection.

104
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,190
When the skin is fully grafted

105
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,716
and has its own flow of blood from your face,

106
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,917
the piece is cut away from your arm,

107
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,393
and then the healthy skin
is used to shape you something

108
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,278
where your nose would have been.

109
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,470
So it's awful.

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,959
With no bone or cartilage to support the skin,

111
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,674
it won't be more than a covering for that hole.

112
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,991
But it will partially restore you.

113
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,675
Not to what you were, I'm afraid.

114
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,039
I haven't been that for quite a while.

115
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,033
I'll give you the name of an excellent surgeon.

116
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,189
Won't you do it?

117
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,390
I'm not really able to right now.

118
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,357
Is it a matter of your schedule? I can wait.

119
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,351
No, no, no. It's just, um...

120
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,671
Dr. Gibbons at Bellevue
has performed this many times.

121
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,116
I'd really feel more comfortable if it was you.

122
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,790
I know it's a lot to ask,

123
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,312
but try to remember me before.

124
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,515
Oh, I remember you perfectly.

125
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,955
Then please, John.

126
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,951
You look like trouble's
been visiting you there, Herm.

127
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,071
A sudden tooth extraction.

128
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,998
You'll never catch me going to no dentist.

129
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,436
Keep sticking
to your guns there, Dietz.

130
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,397
Barbarians, every one of them.

131
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,233
This one certainly was.

132
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,550
Go on, get yourself an edge.
It'll take the sting.

133
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,029
I'll take a phenacetin
and rub some rum and cocaine on it.

134
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,470
It should be fine. I'm just here for my body.

135
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,995
That's gonna be a bit of a problem.

136
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,151
I took a better offer.

137
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,679
You promised me a dead man.

138
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,870
Some fellas from Cornell came by
and gave me 75 bucks for the stiff.

139
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,877
You've never given me more than 20.

140
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,872
Oh, for fuck's sake, Dietz.

141
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,114
I needed that corpse.

142
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,112
Effie, dear.

143
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,714
Uh...

144
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,552
I'll be with you in just a moment.

145
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,437
I'm actually in a bit of a hurry.

146
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,676
-I'll only be a minute.
-So will I.

147
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,832
Of course.

148
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,436
We'll reconvene later.

149
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,552
She's wearing more than a year
of my wages on her back.

150
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,953
There was a day you would have apologized
for not introducing me.

151
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,430
Because I know you have no interest
in meeting any of them.

152
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,398
Of course not, but now they know that.

153
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,517
My father always ran his haberdashery
with unfailing politeness.

154
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,556
Everyone of my class did.

155
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,477
You could certainly take a lesson from us.

156
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,036
And how polite was he
when his creditors shut his doors?

157
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,990
Even then he was as courteous as a king.

158
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,470
Certainly kinder to me
than you are being right now.

159
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,278
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,713
I'm in a bit of pain here.

161
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,588
My mouth feels like an attack
from the hounds of hell.

162
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,033
You didn't even tell me
you were going to a dentist.

163
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,680
-I should know these things.
-It was last minute.

164
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,756
I wasn't expecting he'd pull the tooth.

165
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,269
It was foolish of you to let him.

166
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,599
Expect you're here for some money.

167
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,395
You left the apartment
so quickly this morning,

168
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,471
I didn't even have a chance to ask.

169
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,558
Well, here you are asking now.

170
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,238
It's not much.

171
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,311
I wanted to take a few friends to lunch,

172
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,517
and the children need new suits
for Sunday school.

173
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,629
And while I was out, I thought maybe I'd have
a little look for myself at Bonwit Teller.

174
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,792
Of course.

175
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,238
You haven't by chance

176
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,788
seen those pearl earrings
that you bought me, have you?

177
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,149
No. Not at all.

178
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,195
Are they missing?

179
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,032
They're no longer in my jewelry case.

180
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,071
I couldn't have misplaced them.

181
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,559
Perhaps the maid.

182
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,436
I was thinking that myself.

183
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,353
You need to fire her.

184
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,990
First thing when she arrives for work
tomorrow morning.

185
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,195
How busy is it down here after, say,
11:00 pm?

186
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,795
It's just me and Woodson
keeping the boilers going.

187
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,273
No one else shows.

188
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,033
And after dark,
if you ain't got business down here,

189
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,269
you ain't coming down here.

190
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,033
And no one but us got business down here.

191
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,119
What if I had some business down here?

192
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,270
I ain't losing my job for nobody.

193
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,873
You won't.

194
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,711
You and Hiram
will simply be adding a few responsibilities

195
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,473
and earning a little extra on the side

196
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,198
for your troubles.

197
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,518
Think about it. Excuse me for a moment.

198
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,192
Time's up.

199
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,829
May I see?

200
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,230
Okay, but I've never sewn
on chicken skin before.

201
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,796
I asked for 100 stitches.

202
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,276
I did that. And then since I still had time,

203
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,430
I did 100 more.

204
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,194
The first bunch I did like you told me.

205
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,354
The second bunch I did
like we do on the pillows

206
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,873
so the seam don't show.

207
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,279
Is that okay, sir?

208
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,590
Congratulations, Miss Odom.

209
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,355
You've just been promoted from laundress

210
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,993
to surgical nurse.

211
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,955
-Good night, Miss Cummins.
-Good night, sir.

212
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,998
Doctors, good evening to you.

213
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,348
-Evening.
-Evening.

214
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,318
See you bright and early, Nurse Baker.

215
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,352
Nurse.

216
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,678
Nurse!

217
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,516
You're not a nurse.

218
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,870
No, but I'm a doctor.

219
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,636
Where does it hurt? Your lower left side?

220
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,988
This should help with the pain.

221
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,351
And you'll be able to sleep.

222
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,917
Evening.

223
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,991
Back door to the kitchen?

224
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,718
Right there.

225
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,552
Thank you.

226
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,754
I'm here about the washing job.

227
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,799
It's all there.

228
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,360
And just in the nick

229
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,630
for the man from The Knick.

230
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,189
Now how hard was that, Herm?

231
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,077
Like raising the dead.

232
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,190
Aren't you forgetting something?

233
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,989
That is not my tooth.

234
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,838
Get the fuck out!

235
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,915
It's not as simple as running
any other sort of business.

236
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,909
Meetings and budget-making, that's true,

237
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,276
but there are decisions that I make

238
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,399
every single day
that could change the whole place.

239
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,396
Hospital's no game.

240
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,672
It's not like the law

241
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,751
or making an advert.

242
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,751
You save people's lives.

243
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,114
It's brave.

244
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,515
I don't think I could be around all that.

245
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,558
A beautiful girl like you
should not have to be.

246
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,591
I'll see to that.

247
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,189
I got you a little something.

248
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,278
Hermie.

249
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,873
No!

250
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,429
-What is it?
-Be patient, little girl.

251
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,879
Come on, let me see.

252
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,791
Close your eyes.

253
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,596
Now open them.

254
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,270
Hermie!

255
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,599
-It's too much.
-No.

256
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,309
There is no such thing
where you're concerned.

257
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,391
They're wonderful.

258
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,711
Put them on.

259
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,078
Let me see.

260
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,118
Oh, yes.

261
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,034
You're the most wonderful man in the world.

262
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,237
Now do you want your special gift?

263
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,559
Yes.

264
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,750
Will you show me the "busy flea"?

265
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,035
Oh, dear! Is that a flea on me?

266
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,758
It just went under my dress.

267
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,798
Where is it?

268
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,590
-Where is it?
-It's on your tit.

269
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,871
- Who is it?
- I'm...

270
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,710
I'm here about the washing job.

271
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,871
Anyone see you?

272
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,678
I don't think so.

273
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,954
Mmm. All right.

274
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,837
You're gonna go right through this door here.

275
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,713
He should be right there.

276
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,358
-Thank you.
-Mmm-hmm.

277
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,953
What's your name?

278
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,634
Larkin.

279
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,234
Trouble?

280
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,913
I've been passing blood. I don't know why.

281
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,278
The doc's working on a patient,
so it's gonna be a while.

282
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,920
We got The Evening World
and tonight's Tribune.

283
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,718
Have a seat.

284
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,389
I've taken
an anterior approach to the groin,

285
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,311
dividing the posterior wall

286
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,110
of the inguinal canal.

287
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,950
I-N-G-U-I-N-A-L.

288
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,830
Ligating the peritoneal sac.

289
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,469
P-E-R-I-T-O-N-E-A-L.

290
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,476
I will now carry out a three-layer hernia repair

291
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,751
of my own design.

292
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,758
Miss Odom.

293
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,397
I'd like you to begin ligating
from that point right there.

294
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,795
-You want me to begin what?
-Sewing.

295
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,952
Use the stitch I taught you
on the bottom layer.

296
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,799
I will start the next layer from this side

297
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,998
and we'll do the third layer the same.

298
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,593
Blood's gonna get all over the thread.

299
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,989
That is to be expected. Just sew.

300
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,311
Make sure it holds fast
to guard against any reherniation.

301
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,557
Are you sure it's okay for me to be doing this?

302
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,314
There's no one here to stop you.

303
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,638
How's it progressing, love?

304
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,432
It isn't.

305
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,069
What's the issue?

306
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,634
The issue is that
Miss Brownlee's Finishing School

307
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,950
never taught me
the French words for coagulate

308
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,150
or duodenum or infarction.

309
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,912
It's all very technical.

310
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,793
I was taught to serve tea cakes.

311
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,272
If you needed assistance
deciphering a restaurant menu,

312
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,952
then I'd be your girl.

313
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,470
Everett, I tried.

314
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,515
No, no, no, yeah, you did.

315
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,037
Don't worry yourself, pet.

316
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,710
Why are you so against asking Edwards?

317
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,877
The promotion is already his.
He can't take it from you twice.

318
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,677
He's already taken enough
without any merit to justify it.

319
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,797
No, he's not worthy of the job.
He never has been.

320
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,791
Everett, I'm so sorry.

321
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,396
You ask so little of me,
and when you do need me, I fail you.

322
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,670
You could never fail me.

323
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,072
No, it was unfair of me
to ask this of you at such a late hour.

324
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,076
Lillian needs a feeding.

325
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,310
As soon as I'm finished, I can try again.

326
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,755
No, no, this is good. Thank you, Eleanor.

327
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,308
It's a girl. Six months at most.

328
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,789
Should I get a doctor
so she can be examined?

329
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,956
Only if you want it done poorly.

330
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,310
But please run a small bath for her.

331
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,356
Thank you, Theresa.

332
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,871
She's a lucky wee babe.

333
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,715
To have made it this far, I mean.

334
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,874
Excuse me.

335
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,036
-Excuse me. Good morning.
-Good morning.

336
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,752
Is that beef suet in rice gruel?

337
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,829
Yes.

338
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,116
May I have a bowl, please?

339
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,118
How are you
feeling this morning?

340
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,349
Stiff.

341
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,716
Probably the mattress. You hungry?

342
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,233
Not really.

343
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,435
You should probably eat something.

344
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,950
This will nourish you
and go easy on your stomach.

345
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,831
That looks pretty good.

346
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,359
Wish I could keep you here longer,

347
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,513
but I can't risk
the people upstairs finding out.

348
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,678
I'll arrange a ride home for you
before the morning staff arrives.

349
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,558
One of the coal men
will carry you out to the coach.

350
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,319
So I can go back to work, then?

351
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,789
No. No, not for several weeks.

352
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,115
Strict bed rest.

353
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,789
I'm guessing that work is what gave you
the hernia in the first place.

354
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,797
I'll write out instructions on
how to change your dressings.

355
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,833
Can you read?

356
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,753
My wife does. Better than me.

357
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,598
Well...

358
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,432
Make sure you eat.

359
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,309
Rockefeller just pledged $100,000
to Wellesley College.

360
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,714
"Students indulged in cheers for the college
and Mr. Rockefeller before recitation."

361
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,240
Seems there's no love letter to John D.
too sweet

362
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,550
that the Times won't print one weekly.

363
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,715
They delight in reminding us
just how easily he can give his fortune away,

364
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,711
even though he is a bit of a prick.

365
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,869
August.

366
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,870
I'm sure you and Jesse are pleased
to have our boy back in New York.

367
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,633
Oh, we are. Can't thank you enough for that.

368
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,951
He's a smart boy,
but I'm sure you already know that.

369
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,238
Nobody gets tired of hearing good things
about their children, Captain, sir.

370
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:49,160
I have always known a quality investment.

371
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,236
And he has proven himself
to be worth every penny.

372
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,677
Well, I hope our Algernon'll
continue to prove you right.

373
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,910
Some more creamed potatoes?

374
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,951
You know I can't resist.

375
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,589
Here we are.

376
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,511
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

377
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,834
How are Thackery and Algernon getting on?

378
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,953
- Nothing's changed.
- Do I need to step in?

379
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,150
I can certainly give Thack's leash a tug.

380
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,312
Algernon says
he wants to take care of the matter himself.

381
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,637
Well, you let me know.

382
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,033
We have a bit of history,
the good doctor and I.

383
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,153
Darling, any word from Phillip?

384
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,198
Yes, he sent a cable. He's in Chicago now.

385
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,350
His train arrives here on the 12th.

386
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,791
I do hope he'll be pleased
with the arrangements

387
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,472
we've already made for your wedding.

388
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,758
Now, there is a young man
no one will dare underestimate.

389
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,110
He and Henry have done a fine job

390
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,475
securing my new freight lines to the Orient.

391
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,593
It is a shame that Henry couldn't be here
for last night's opening at the Met.

392
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,591
He does love it so.

393
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,395
The Abbotts
weren't in attendance last night either.

394
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,232
They've never missed an opening.

395
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,272
Didn't you hear?

396
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,712
Leonard and Franklin
were struck down with the typhoid.

397
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,992
They're at the Manhattan Hospital.

398
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,878
-When?
-Day before last. Dreadfully sick.

399
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,996
And didn't you tell me Daniel Hemming
and his daughter

400
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,514
- were admitted to The Knick with the same?
- Yes.

401
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,870
Do you know if they've been
spending any time with immigrants?

402
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,154
They carry it, you know.

403
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,071
Oh, for God's sake, Mother.

404
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,675
Let's just hope
this isn't the beginning of an epidemic.

405
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,558
John D.

406
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,988
Ma'am.

407
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,112
Start with the junction boxes.

408
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,031
-Thread it back to the fixtures.
-All right.

409
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,717
Obviously the duty nurse wasn't lying
when she said you'd been working all night.

410
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,076
It's a slaughterhouse in here.

411
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,158
Now you see
why we have no Jewish doctors.

412
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,075
But it seems they've all died in vain.

413
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,476
I'm no further ahead than when I arrived.

414
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,835
Perhaps Dr. Edwards could help.

415
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,152
What is it with your allegiance to him?

416
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,038
His family has worked for us
since before he was born.

417
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,914
My father is very loyal to his employees.

418
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,194
In the house, maybe.

419
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,511
I'm sure his men down at the shipyards
would tell a different story.

420
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,070
Dr. Edwards is no pet.

421
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,755
He's been a person of substance
for as long as I've known him.

422
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,989
Did you want something?

423
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,438
A few days ago, two patients were
admitted with typhoid fever,

424
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,876
and just this morning
I've heard of another case breaking

425
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,268
in a separate household.

426
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,672
That's 50 fewer than are likely to be admitted
to hospitals on any given day in this city.

427
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,475
Not quite. One was at the Abbott house
on 58th and Fifth

428
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,198
and another at the Hemmings'.

429
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,749
What, the banking family?

430
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,950
And coal and some cattle in the West.

431
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,359
Bully for them.

432
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,790
If it were down on Mulberry
or Delancey Street, I'd understand.

433
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,030
Despite what you might believe,

434
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,112
sickness isn't a result of poor character.

435
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,154
Germs don't examine your bank book.

436
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,949
Try not to let your prejudice against
anyone else's success but your own

437
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,189
cloud your judgment.

438
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,594
Germs may be indifferent to wealth,
but typhoid ones do enjoy poor sanitation,

439
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,995
cramped quarters
and a lack of proper sewage.

440
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,195
I grant you that.

441
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,793
So, I ask you again,

442
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,314
with none of these negative elements
being present,

443
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,198
are the cases of the Abbotts
and the Hemmings peculiar?

444
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,477
Well, at the very least, surprising.

445
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:15,236
Perhaps we should summon
Inspector Speight and have a word.

446
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,151
What happened to that other fellow?

447
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,037
The one who's sick like me.

448
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,512
Mr. Olynyk?

449
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,318
He didn't survive.

450
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,475
But despite you both
having similar diagnoses,

451
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,592
we are working on
a very different procedure to try out on you.

452
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,518
Not to worry.

453
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,356
-Are you cold?
-Yeah.

454
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,715
-Should we go in?
-Yeah.

455
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,592
Yes. Come on, my love.

456
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,237
Okay. Come on, everybody.
Let's get inside for lunch.

457
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,430
If they only knew.

458
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,518
Knew what?

459
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,478
What you really are.

460
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,034
Her father died last night.

461
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,079
She's still suffering
and it's anyone's guess if she'll survive.

462
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,675
Both have typhoid fever.

463
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,916
Another family from uptown, the Abbotts,

464
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,037
have two members admitted to the
German hospital with the same.

465
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,231
And there are rumors that Elihu Brown

466
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,754
had two of his live-in servants
fall ill in January,

467
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,229
but he kept it quiet for obvious reasons.

468
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,596
What reasons?
He didn't wish to stop an outbreak?

469
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,393
I think you can understand
a man in his position

470
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,754
not wanting to stir up a fuss.

471
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,671
To be frank with you, Miss Robertson,
in my work,

472
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,433
upsetting the apple cart is the bulk of my job.

473
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,750
Nobody likes to see me coming.

474
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,115
Do you think there's any relation
between the cases?

475
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,918
It's fishy.

476
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,156
Your type don't see much of this sort of thing.

477
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,754
In the tenements,
six cases would have blown up to 60

478
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,512
in a couple weeks
and we'd know what we have.

479
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,875
But uptown, it's sneaky.

480
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,635
It don't spread.
It hops, picking places to land.

481
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,115
-Then you'll investigate?
-Mmm.

482
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,033
Something giving rich folks
a poor folks' disease?

483
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,439
It needs a look.

484
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,556
I'll call on the family and make my inquiries.

485
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,709
I'll come with you.

486
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,030
I've been above 14th Street before, miss.

487
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,712
I don't need a guide.

488
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,916
But you'll need an ambassador
to get in the door.

489
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,356
Miss Robertson,

490
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,558
I have the full power of the health department
and the city of New York.

491
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,478
I have the authority
to get into any door I want.

492
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,235
Perhaps so, but if you want anyone to talk
to you inside those doors,

493
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,073
you'll never speak like that to their faces.

494
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,192
Hey, Doc. How long has she got?

495
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,395
Not very.

496
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,630
Temperature is higher. Diarrhea is worse.

497
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,395
I'm worried her bowels may have perforated.

498
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,590
I'll have Dr. Thackery take a look.

499
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,309
Rhus tox?

500
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,879
Three times a day.

501
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,755
Stools?

502
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,595
My first concern was when the fat globules
showed up and then the blood.

503
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,039
You think it's just the treatment?

504
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,835
No, her weak pulse and everything
you're telling me suggests othenwise.

505
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,356
It's most likely
her intestines are already perforated.

506
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,398
Would you give her
one teaspoon of turpentine

507
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,948
every three hours
to help with the perforation?

508
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,599
See if that relieves some of her agony.

509
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,990
So you won't operate?

510
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,269
The risk would be too great.

511
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,793
But there is a procedure?

512
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,879
There would be no point.

513
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,270
The point would be to save a young girl
who has her entire life ahead of her.

514
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,873
She's too far gone.

515
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,520
She would almost certainly die
under the knife.

516
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,318
And if she did miraculously survive,

517
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,392
her life would be
grossly compromised forever.

518
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,871
Perforation means the loops
of her intestines are sticking together.

519
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,598
I would have to resect large areas,

520
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,240
which would inevitably
lead to more perforations,

521
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,231
more surgeries, more complications.

522
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,551
But a chance she could live
is better than doing nothing.

523
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,512
If little Cora knew the details,
even in her delirious state,

524
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,989
I am certain that she would elect
to have her own will

525
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,599
determine if she can beat this illness

526
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,911
rather than die at my hands
in an operating room.

527
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,197
Thus far we have fried the heart,
crisped the aorta,

528
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,714
and left behind a terrible puncture wound.

529
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,073
Yes, but it does smell pleasantly
like breakfast.

530
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,431
So, the wire corrodes
inside the artery every time.

531
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,756
Perhaps it's too much current.

532
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,673
Right, or maybe the wrong sort of wire.

533
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,116
Maybe copper is wrong and tin is right.

534
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,997
But how do we know?

535
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,599
Here.

536
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,589
It says here to
"couper en dessous du ventricule. "

537
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,513
We know that ventricule is ventricle
and couper means to cut.

538
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:19,879
Right, but it also means to nick, to slice,
to disconnect or to break.

539
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,637
So we don't know whether we're
supposed to make a small nick

540
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,835
or cut the whole thing off.

541
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,957
Even the simplest words
mean five things in French.

542
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,837
They are the worst.

543
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,310
-I think we should just...
-No, we don't need him.

544
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,709
He likely isn't as familiar
with the procedure as he claims.

545
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,314
We're far better off without him.

546
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,119
Everett, he did coauthor the paper.

547
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,188
Those people are known
to exaggerate their accomplishments, Bertie.

548
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,072
One second.

549
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,318
Yes?

550
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,874
Do you have a moment, Doctor?

551
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,197
Bertie the Brave
and the good Knight Gallinger.

552
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,871
All I want to hear is that it works
and you got it solved.

553
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,876
No, we're hopelessly lost.

554
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,151
-But we did find something.
-It's not good.

555
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,078
But it might be.

556
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,277
It concerns Edwards
and the procedure he described.

557
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,274
We can learn it with Edwards' help,
but it just might be what we had hoped.

558
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,399
Bertie's more of a dreamer
than is good for him.

559
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,674
Edwards is a fraud.

560
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,030
Well, then, he's a fraud
who's been listed as a coauthor

561
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,476
of a published paper alongside Dr. Thibaux.

562
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,752
Dr. Algernon C. Edwards.

563
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,751
Seems like we're gonna
need this man after all.

564
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,235
No, we don't.

565
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,550
Calm yourself, Everett.
You'll do the procedure.

566
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,710
All we'll have him do is talk you through it.

567
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,792
He'll never lay a hand on your patient.

568
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,679
Very well.

569
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,708
Schedule says you're doing
a skin graft on a syphilitic this afternoon.

570
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,472
Yes.

571
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,154
- You need assistance?
- No. I'll be fine.

572
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,673
In fact, you interrupted

573
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,992
my preparations.

574
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,679
Of course.

575
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,034
-Open or closed?
-Closed.

576
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,112
Hello.

577
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,951
Welcome back.

578
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,350
Dr. Edwards, you're needed downstairs.

579
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,351
I'm in the middle of a procedure.

580
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,112
I ain't asking.

581
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,798
-I told you to stay home.
-I can't lose my job.

582
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,189
Shit, he ain't the only one.
I told you this was a bad idea.

583
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,350
Just help me get him to the operating table.

584
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,710
And then fetch Miss Odom
and Mrs. Gamble from the laundry.

585
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,915
Right, 'cause they ain't gonna be wondering

586
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,638
why the coal man is running around upstairs.

587
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,153
Just go!

588
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,917
Yeager's needle and silk.

589
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,073
Nurse Baker?

590
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,597
Steady at 82.

591
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,036
She's got beautiful hair.

592
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,953
That color, what I wouldn't give.

593
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,238
I want to get underneath

594
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,396
to add some sutures to strengthen the graft.

595
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,790
Could you slightly lift the flap
to allow me access below?

596
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,154
Gently. Gently.

597
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,998
Lucy says you knew her, Dr. Thackery.

598
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,437
She must have been lovely.

599
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,634
Please refer to her as Nurse Elkins.

600
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,350
My apologies, Nurse Elkins.

601
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,037
Okay, now the top.
Smaller gauge needle, please.

602
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,676
Usually it's the streetwalkers,
but she's no prostitute.

603
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,912
Not with those nails. This is a lady.

604
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,956
This is a patient, nothing more.

605
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,029
I just meant that your heart breaks
for a good woman who's in a bad way.

606
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,953
Must be awful to wear
the shame on your face for people to see.

607
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,794
Nurse Baker, another word from you
about anything other than the job at hand,

608
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,715
and I will sew your mouth and nostrils shut
and happily watch you asphyxiate.

609
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,239
He tore it all open and then some.

610
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,232
Blood is coming from everywhere.
We've got to stop it now.

611
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,713
I'm gonna clamp as much as I can

612
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,997
and then you follow behind me
and sew everything you see

613
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,672
that's got blood coming out of it.

614
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,273
His pulse, Mrs. Gamble.

615
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,112
He's still got one.

616
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,519
Close enough.

617
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,555
That's good, Miss Odom.
You're doing just fine.

618
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,352
I'm gonna run out of thread.

619
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,635
-Where do you keep it?
-Right back there.

620
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,199
There ain't none.

621
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,597
Why didn't you tell me we were running low?

622
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,399
-I just did.
-God damn it.

623
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,198
I do laundry.

624
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,958
You want a nurse, you go hire one.

625
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,793
Okay, okay.
Just keep suturing with what you have left

626
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,952
and I... I'll be right back.

627
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,315
Excuse me.
A slight emergency in the outdoor clinic.

628
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,118
I just need some silk.

629
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,590
Edwards, we're operating
on Mr. Gatchell in the morning.

630
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,750
We're gonna need you
in the operating theater.

631
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,149
We're doing your galvanic procedure.

632
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,310
Ah! Will you be assisting me?

633
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,118
No, I'll be assisting Gallinger.

634
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,832
It's his patient.

635
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,919
What will I be doing?

636
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,835
Just talking him through the procedure.

637
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,508
That's all.

638
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,713
His pulse, Mrs. Gamble?

639
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,478
It don't feel like it did before.

640
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,074
-It's different.
-How different?

641
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,355
Not so strong.
Kind of back and forth.

642
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,556
I get it, then I don't.

643
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,032
Keep sewing. There's one there,
one there, and I'll take that one there.

644
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,633
Now it's gone again.

645
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,591
Come on, Mr. Cockrell.

646
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,751
- Is it back yet?
- No.

647
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,155
And he ain't breathing no more either.

648
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,192
- Anything?
- No.

649
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,032
I think he dead.

650
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,239
Shit!

651
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,632
What should we do with him?

652
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,590
Drop him in the bushes on Murray Hill.

653
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,077
Someone will find him.

654
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:44,152
That really was like trying to make
a silk purse out of a sow's ear.

655
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,318
What was the point?

656
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,158
She'll look better.

657
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,754
She'll always be alone.

658
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,314
Ruined and diseased.

659
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,394
What kind of a future does she have?

660
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,390
Maybe more than she did.

661
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,396
"No medicine in the world can do thee good."

662
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,639
In the blackest darkness,
even a dim light is better than no light at all.

663
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,278
Who said that?

664
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,597
I just did.

665
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,751
But I thought you said
operating was too risky.

666
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:33,470
Well, sometimes all the options
aren't immediately apparent.

667
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,317
I'd like to try stitching together
two pieces of Cora's gut

668
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,277
to a fold in her peritoneum.

669
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,759
It might give her a chance.

670
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,271
Do I have your permission?

671
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,508
Of course.

672
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,637
I'll have the nurses begin preparing her.

673
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,920
Where is Cora Hemming?
Why didn't anyone fetch me?

674
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,798
Dr. Thackery took her to surgery
about an hour ago.

675
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,475
You'll be very happy to know,
Miss Robertson,

676
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,478
we got lucky.

677
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,309
Far Rockaway.

678
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,512
Yeah, I've been lots of places.

679
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,552
Around the world and back again.

680
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,075
Like where?

681
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,872
Delaware.

682
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,278
Yeah, plenty good folk down there.

683
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,112
I got kin in Tennessee.

684
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,071
- I've been there a bunch, too.
- Hmm-hmm.

685
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,719
Got a real sojourner over here.

686
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,476
You know what it's like in Memphis?

687
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,188
No.

688
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,719
Hot.

689
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,635
A regular Rudyard Kipling.

690
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,834
You have something to say to me?

691
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,919
No.

692
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,000
I just didn't realize
that around the world and back again

693
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,152
meant anywhere you could get to
in a few days on a horse.

694
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,712
Shut your mouth.

695
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,631
Or I'll shut it for you.

696
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,311
I'd like to see that.
