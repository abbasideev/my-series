1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,229
Right in here.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,437
Right this way, gentlemen.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,076
Bring him right in here.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,158
-Easy.
-Okay.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,229
What happened to his face?

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,878
What the hell do you think?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,831
Some son of a bitch took a cosh to it.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,190
Ah, he looks healthy enough.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,353
Bed rest and cold compress
is my professional prescription.

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,159
Only cost you two bits. Pay at the door.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,595
The right leg, sawbones.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,515
Oh.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,952
Ain't you supposed to wash your hands first?

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,110
Are you telling me how to do my job?

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,953
I've been practicing medicine since the war.

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,508
And in all that time, I can tell you,

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,160
I never had a single complaint
from anyone that lived.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,118
For the love of Christ, boss,
why don't we take him to the Knick?

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,796
Because I don't want to be in debt
to that crooked little shit Barrow.

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,035
How bad is it?

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,635
Not as bad as it might have been.
The bullet broke the bone.

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,069
Looks like it missed the big artery in there.

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,152
Well, I suppose we might as well get started.

24
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,516
If you gentlemen
would take a firm hold of your friend.

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,033
No! No! No! No!

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,873
All right, that fucking tears it.

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,598
Find a telephone.

28
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,474
Whoever the hell this is,

29
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,679
go to hell.

30
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,477
Hey, I almost forgot!

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,154
You owe me two bits for the consultation.

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,631
Treatment comes
with a free shave and a haircut!

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,675
Bring your friend back around!

34
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,073
If he lives.

35
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,196
I hate for you to see me this way.

36
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,989
Believe me, Mr. Mendieta,
there's nothing to be ashamed of.

37
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,469
Does it cause you a great deal of pain?

38
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,755
It make it difficult to walk.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,436
You can push it all you like,
but it won't go back in.

40
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,711
I'm sorry to tell you, you're suffering from
an irreducible indirect inguinal hernia.

41
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,068
A weakness in your peritoneum

42
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,358
has made it possible for tissue
to insinuate its way into your scrotal sac.

43
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,032
Do you...

44
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,588
Do you understand what I'm saying?

45
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,989
I understand
that you don't treat me like a man.

46
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,430
Using all your big words
while I stand here half-naked.

47
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,399
My apologies.

48
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,794
Why don't you get dressed
and I'll explain what we have to do.

49
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,119
Mendieta.

50
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,071
Is that a Cuban name?

51
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,958
Yes, I come here after the war.

52
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,037
How do you make your living?

53
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,394
With your back?

54
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,914
No I am e! tabaquero.

55
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,551
I roll cigars.

56
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,834
100% Cuban tobacco.

57
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,839
Thank you.

58
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,675
No, no, I'll save it for later.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,116
Mmm-hmm. It's okay.

60
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,910
Mr. Mendieta, the only treatment
for your type of hernia is surgery.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,194
Please.

62
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,516
Unfortunately,

63
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,991
I have yet to perform an operation
in which the silk sutures,

64
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,591
the sewing that reinforces the gut
hasn't failed.

65
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,077
That's why, with your permission,
Mr. Mendieta,

66
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,073
I would like to perform your operation
using a metallic wire, like silver,

67
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,354
as a medical suture.

68
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,158
And what happens to me
if this surgery fails, too?

69
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,831
You probably won't die,

70
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,115
but it's possible that you will suffer intensely
for the rest of your life.

71
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,399
They say...

72
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,918
They say every cloud has a silver lining.

73
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,116
And now Mendieta will have one, too.

74
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,034
Right this way, gentlemen, please.

75
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,188
Bunky Collier.
This is one of Bunky Collier's pimps?

76
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,510
It's his brother-in-law, in fact.

77
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,589
Can you save the leg?

78
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,671
What kind of business
have you got with Bunky Collier?

79
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,352
Can you save the leg or not?

80
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,910
Edwards, what brings you here
so early in the morning?

81
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,991
Just trying to impress you, Dr. Thackery.

82
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,550
Well, as long as you're here, scrub in.
You'll be assisting me in surgery.

83
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,438
- Like hell he will.
- Who else is there? Gallinger?

84
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,715
He doesn't have a telephone.
But Dr. Chickering is on his way.

85
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,837
He lives all the way uptown.
Time is of the essence, Barrow.

86
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,718
You want me to save the personage or not?

87
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,877
Very well, gentlemen.

88
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,472
Knuckle dragger.

89
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,639
Excuse me?

90
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,876
I assume you've read Danrvin.

91
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,513
You're certainly taking
your damn time about it.

92
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,997
Ought to plug you in the leg.
See how fast things move around here then.

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,275
The doctors will begin shortly.

94
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,517
In the meantime, I thought we might discuss
the matter of compensation for my services.

95
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,313
I told you in the carriage.

96
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,392
I'll cut 500 from your debt
if you don't lose the leg.

97
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,239
Fair enough?

98
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,558
Not fair at all, actually.

99
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,511
Five hundred barely covers
a few months' interest.

100
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,312
Thank you, nurses. We'll take it from here.

101
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,714
What the hell is that?

102
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,233
What's that coon think
he's doing down there?

103
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,709
We're understaffed
this early in the morning.

104
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,793
I can assure you, Dr. Edwards
will only be assisting in the surgery.

105
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,314
That black bastard
better not get too familiar with my man

106
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,949
if he don't want to find himself
hanging from a lamppost.

107
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,393
One thing more.

108
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,231
If he loses that leg,

109
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,551
I'll compensate you by shooting
all three of you in the fucking face.

110
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,632
How's his pulse?

111
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,752
Weak, but steady.

112
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,428
Vacuum.

113
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,638
Christ, the bullet is lodged in the tunica.

114
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,750
It's the only reason
he hasn't already bled to death.

115
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,873
Do you really think
we'll be able to save this leg?

116
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,554
I'm not even sure we can save the man.

117
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,195
Tourniquet.

118
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,078
We need to take the leg off now.

119
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,634
It's already showing signs of necrosis.

120
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,394
Can't get
the broken bones to set.

121
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,358
His pulse is eccentric.
We need to amputate now.

122
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,356
See, the sharp ends of the broken bones
were preventing secure connection.

123
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,273
Would you thread me up a length of catgut?

124
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,595
See, the

125
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,555
funny thing about DanNin.

126
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,951
You know, he wanted to be a doctor.

127
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,029
Couldn't stand the sight of blood.

128
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,279
Has anyone else experienced
symptoms of typhoid since the boys fell ill?

129
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,915
Not that I know of,
Miss Robertson.

130
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,958
Did the boys dine anywhere unusual lately?

131
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,029
No.

132
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,873
Have they had occasion to relieve themselves
anywhere outside of here?

133
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,312
-An outhouse, say, or latrine?
-I beg your pardon?

134
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,516
How many toilets
you got in this joint anyway?

135
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,392
You're welcome to count them.

136
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,232
Are all the staff here today?

137
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,550
All but three who were released last week.

138
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,915
We needed fewer staff at the summer home.

139
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,479
Which three were released?

140
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,154
Mr. Brock, the electric automobile driver,

141
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,748
Miss Mallon and Miss Monroe,
assistants to the cook.

142
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,633
Do you have their addresses?

143
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,951
If I do, they're in the household accounts.

144
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,389
Do you handle much raw food
this time of year?

145
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,677
Some fruits and vegetables, of course.

146
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,228
- Ice cream?
- Oh, yes. Every day.

147
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,039
Now, where are the lord and lady of the house
this fine morning?

148
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,994
Mrs. Cooke spent the night at the hospital
with the boys

149
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,310
and Mr. Cooke left word
he was not to be disturbed.

150
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,357
That ain't up to him.

151
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,955
For all his money, he shouldn't think
that he's immune to this disease.

152
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,679
Unless, of course,
he's got a servant who wipes his ass for him.

153
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,398
Christ.

154
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,710
It gets so humid in this town.

155
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,315
It's all the tall buildings.
They capture the heat.

156
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,076
A pleasure, as always, Doctor.

157
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,752
How's our personage?

158
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,798
He's still bipedal.

159
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,030
I'll take the drain out in 24 hours.

160
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,351
If there's no pus within a week,
he should make a complete recovery.

161
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,874
So he will walk again?

162
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,274
Oh, he'll be back to accommodating you
at one of Collier's cathouses in no time at all.

163
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,756
Still got a few minutes.

164
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,033
Why don't you get cleaned up?

165
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,154
For what?

166
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,709
You haven't forgotten, have you?

167
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,233
The Edison people
are making their presentation at noon.

168
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,236
It gives me great pleasure to present today
the Edison X-ray photographic apparatus.

169
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,070
Evelyn, if you'll be so kind.

170
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,594
One places the photographic plate here

171
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,153
while the patient's afflicted limb
is then placed on top of that.

172
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,918
The X-ray tube is then activated.

173
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,119
And the result is the X-ray photograph.

174
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,034
A peerless tool for medical diagnosis.

175
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,349
They are, specifically of a 35-year-old woman.

176
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,553
You can see the phalanges here.
The proximal, the distal.

177
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,635
And here, where she fractured
her second and third metacarpals.

178
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,517
Sewing machine, I believe.

179
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,955
-It's incredible.
-It's the future.

180
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,708
And what does the future cost these days?

181
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,909
$3,000.

182
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,399
Are you insane?

183
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,718
We've just spent the past hour
discussing cost-cutting measures.

184
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,394
And now you want to splurge
on some sideshow attraction?

185
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,314
You think that saving money
by not laundering staff uniforms

186
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,153
and charging them for meals,
as Mr. Barrow suggests,

187
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,277
will suddenly bring back patients
with money?

188
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,269
In less than a year, I guarantee that the X-ray
will be the new standard in diagnosis.

189
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,112
For once, let us be ahead
of the other hospitals.

190
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,716
The only way we're going to be able
to afford this machine

191
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,519
is if the heavens open up
and rain gold down on us.

192
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,433
Short of that,
we'll need to consider other options.

193
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,714
What other options?

194
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,679
Moving the Knick uptown
to where all the money has gone.

195
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,992
Our former donors will come back to us.
We can become profitable again.

196
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,469
The value of this building is only going down.

197
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,791
The neighborhood continues
to be overrun by the poor and unwashed.

198
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,995
Who need us.

199
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,958
Practically every other hospital
has fled uptown.

200
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,792
Who will be left to care for them?

201
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,950
We've given them more than their fair share.

202
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,634
Even the monsignor
won't find it hard to argue

203
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,110
that we've held our charitable hand out
much too long.

204
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,749
Medical advice
is as much a commodity as bread.

205
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,992
And to give either one or the other
to the unworthy is wrong.

206
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,795
It encourages irresponsibility
and reckless use of valuable resources.

207
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,629
Now, I have a prime piece of grassland
on 5th Avenue and 80th Street which...

208
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,950
How will moving
to the middle of nowhere help

209
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,235
except to shorten your commute
to these meetings?

210
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,312
And how will living in a fantasy
where bills don't need to be paid

211
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,153
and expensive resources
are tossed out to the impoverished

212
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,391
like silver coins from a railroad man's carriage
help either?

213
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,952
It's nice in here.

214
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,593
It is with you.

215
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,428
If I could, I would take you away.

216
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,638
And go somewhere.

217
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,795
Montreal, a beach in Carolina.

218
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,317
Leave everyone behind.

219
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,829
I'd go anywhere you told me to.

220
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,389
I had the money, Junia.

221
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,434
I tried.

222
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,915
I try every day to get there.

223
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,471
But I've made some mistakes.

224
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,397
What sort of mistakes?

225
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,313
I took money

226
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,638
from my employer.

227
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,919
I invested it with a Wall Street man
that said it couldn't lose.

228
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,193
Then it did.

229
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,392
So I took more money
and I tried to get it back.

230
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,312
Then we had the drop of '98 and we all lost.

231
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,118
All except for Harriman and Vanderbilt
and his ilk.

232
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,153
They always sail on through, rich as ever.

233
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,033
Do you even know what I'm talking about?

234
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,159
Not really.

235
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,990
Oh! Jesus Christ.

236
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,072
Hello, Mr. Barrow.

237
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,149
Officer.

238
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,030
I come looking for a favor.

239
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,749
Well, in here,
four bucks will get you any favor you want.

240
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,556
It's of a different nature.

241
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,428
I want to propose a little business with
Mr. Collier and I need a proper introducing.

242
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,677
What makes you think
I know this man Collier?

243
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,354
I've seen you coming out of his place
a few times.

244
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,839
Been watching the door there for a while now.

245
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,229
Well, I only go in there
to get cigarillos for my wife.

246
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,155
That's very accommodating of them,
making a 10-cent sale at 2:00 in the morning.

247
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,709
What'd you have in mind?

248
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,914
We get a lot of girls off the street.
Round them up and bring them in.

249
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,150
Freelancers who hook for no one.

250
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,789
I thought if I could convince a few of them
to work for Mr. Collier,

251
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,678
he protects them, gives them
a good place like this to work and...

252
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,955
Give you some money for bringing them in.

253
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,678
It's good for everyone.

254
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,036
It's a service to the girls and to Mr. Collier.

255
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,554
I just need someone
to vouch for me with the man.

256
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,632
Tell Mr. Collier I'm on the level, no tricks.

257
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,191
I thought since we knew each other
from Mr. Speight

258
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,840
and other dealings at your hospital,
you might be inclined.

259
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,230
And what would your boss, Big Bill Devery,
think of your little scheme?

260
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,115
He'd probably want a cut.

261
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,792
So let's not ask.

262
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,957
It's just I got more mouths to feed at home
than he's willing to pay.

263
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,111
Can you do me this favor, Mr. Barrow?

264
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,077
Well, you see, Phinny,

265
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,430
these things don't come free.

266
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,839
Well, what do you know? Right on time.

267
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,718
Punctuality is the politeness of kings.

268
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,396
Is that so?

269
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,311
I'll have to remember that, Harry.

270
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,318
Well, we shouldn't keep
a paying customer waiting.

271
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,994
And here is the patient herself.

272
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,233
Say hello, Mrs. Sung.

273
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,400
Excuse me, Mr. Cleary.

274
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,712
Please, we change our minds
and we must ask you please to leave.

275
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,358
What are you talking about, leave?

276
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,072
Your wife is here to have the procedure.

277
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,755
My wife thinks now the procedure
is contrary to the will of God.

278
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,990
What do you know about the will of God?
You're bloody heathens.

279
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,559
We are Christians.

280
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,915
We were converted
at the Methodist school in Peking.

281
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,150
- And she's a fucking Catholic nun.
- Cleary!

282
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,878
There's not a higher authority in the land

283
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,713
when it comes to matters
of the fucking catechism.

284
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,233
God, fucking Methodists.

285
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,719
Would you give over with the nun?

286
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,792
I'm just trying to ease her conscience a bit.

287
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,151
There, look, she's all docile and ready for you.

288
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,077
So, how shall we begin?

289
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,036
You'll be wanting her to strip naked,
I suppose.

290
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,759
We'll begin with you
leaving the premises at once.

291
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,353
Can't I watch?

292
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,076
Well, you can't object to me
sitting in the kitchen.

293
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,951
All right, all right.

294
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,429
There's a saloon on the corner.
I'll stand myself a growler.

295
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,715
And you can stand him one as well.

296
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,517
-How long has she been like this?
-Since you left this morning.

297
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,678
Poor little thing. She brought up her breakfast

298
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,672
and she hasn't stopped crying
long enough to nurse since then.

299
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,795
All right.

300
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,996
Please put her on the table.

301
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,114
We need to get Lillian to the Knick right away.

302
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,189
What is it?

303
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,316
Go to the bedroom, get the baby's things.
I'll call the carriage.

304
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,435
What's the matter with her, Everett?

305
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,159
-I'll tell you in the carriage.
-No, tell me now.

306
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,599
She's presenting
with symptoms of meningitis.

307
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,715
What is that?

308
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,360
It's a viral infection of the brain,
and a stiff neck is a common symptom.

309
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,552
I just can't be certain.
That's why we need to go to the hospital now.

310
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,638
Where's Mr. Sung?

311
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,709
You're priceless, you know that?

312
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,997
You didn't think I was really gonna bend
an elbow with the yellow menace, did you?

313
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,878
You got here quick.
Foam's not even settled on my beer yet.

314
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,949
I didn't go through with it.

315
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,030
What the hell are you talking about,
you didn't go through with it?

316
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,588
She was seven months along.
The child had quickened.

317
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,914
Fuck does that mean?

318
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,195
It means she could feel it kicking.

319
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,953
Let that be a lesson to you.
It would have been a sin.

320
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,351
Stand me one of those.

321
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,397
Not a very auspicious
start to our partnership.

322
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,191
I think you made the right choice
frog-marching me out of there, though.

323
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,159
No reason both of us should go to Sing Sing
if the guard were to catch you red-handed,

324
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,514
so to speak.

325
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,309
Oh, you're a real gent, Cleary.
And let no man say other wise.

326
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,434
Of course the law says that anyone caught
aiding or abetting abortion

327
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,034
shall be punished in like manner
as the principal offender.

328
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,598
Made a study of the law, have you?

329
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,356
So should you, if this is to be
your only livelihood after the hospital closes.

330
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,793
And who says the hospital is closing?

331
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,677
The smart money is moving uptown.

332
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,672
The Knick will have to do the same
if it doesn't want to be shuttered.

333
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,276
And there's nothing you, nor I, nor even
the great John W. Thackery can do about it,

334
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,632
no matter the miracles he's had to perform
in the operating theater.

335
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,188
And if the hospital moves uptown,
will you go with it?

336
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,192
I'll go wherever the Church sends me.

337
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,918
Well, that's just peachy for you, Sister.

338
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,395
But I'll have you know,
I'm a man what makes his own fate.

339
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,951
There's nothing stopping Tom Cleary

340
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,349
from following the smart money,
as you call it,

341
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,915
anywhere it may lead,
and that includes uptown.

342
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,470
You, my friend,
aren't following anything smart.

343
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,670
Not until you acquire some fine manners
and learn to drive a motorized car.

344
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,993
And dress presentably. And fucking shave.

345
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,999
Barring all that, we're stuck with each other.

346
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,798
-Sléinte.
-Sléinte.

347
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,109
Saddle of lamb

348
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,919
a la Colbert.

349
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,033
Astonishing.

350
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,756
I had the great pleasure
to sample this very dish

351
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,918
only last week.

352
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,954
I believe it is Charles' specialty.

353
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,268
Charles?

354
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,189
Ranhoefer. The chef at Delmonico's.

355
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,996
I wouldn't know.
I haven't been to Delmonico's in years.

356
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,593
No, I was speaking about this.

357
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,470
The ability to see inside the human body
without penetrating the flesh.

358
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,199
You know, the first great fortunes
that were amassed on this planet

359
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,713
were a result of the material,
the wealth that God put in and on the Earth.

360
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,360
Gold and copper, lumber, iron ore.

361
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,793
But this.

362
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,710
This has demonstrated to me
that the next great fortunes

363
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,156
will be a result of the immaterial.

364
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,270
The unseen wealth buzzing all around us
like electricity and X-rays.

365
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,669
Mmm!

366
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,313
So how much?

367
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,076
$3,000 for a single machine.

368
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,037
See?

369
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,556
They're already earning a fortune
on the immaterial.

370
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,835
We'll discuss it over cigars.

371
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,278
Oh, I thought I might see you here tonight,
Robertson.

372
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,509
Corky.

373
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,874
Tell me.

374
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,836
When was the last time
you dined at Delmonico's?

375
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,356
You wouldn't find a Vanderbilt
dead at that place.

376
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,953
It only attracts the riffraff.

377
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,632
You know, I'm sorry to intrude,

378
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,872
but I wanted to thank you for arranging
the luncheon next week with the governor.

379
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,949
Happy to oblige.

380
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,917
To this day, I can't imagine

381
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,472
what possessed the Panamanians
to entrust that project to the French.

382
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,959
Well, they built the Suez Canal.

383
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,473
That was years ago.

384
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,676
And what have we here?

385
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,233
X-ray.

386
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,710
This is an excellent device,
this X-ray machine.

387
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,791
I donated two of them to Manhattan Hospital.

388
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,074
Well...

389
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,272
Enjoy your lamb.

390
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,432
Chateau Lagrange.

391
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,395
'84.

392
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,351
You can have the machine.

393
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,868
The hernia! sac has been cut

394
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,350
and the bowel is being reinserted
into the peritoneum.

395
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,079
Miss Odom.

396
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,357
Please stitch the bottom layer
as I showed you.

397
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,111
Dr. Edwards, how did a man like you

398
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,398
ever get his hands on something
as expensive as silver wire?

399
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,516
It wasn't that hard.

400
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,239
-Just don't ask to see my pocket watch.
-Huh!

401
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,479
Miss Manx?

402
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,276
Pulse is strong and steady.

403
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,353
Mrs. Gamble.

404
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,310
Another here
with an emphasis on the stitching.

405
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,276
Girl, it's a crying shame
all those pretty silver stitches

406
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,715
is going to seal up that fat man.

407
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,752
You remembered to bring something,
didn't you?

408
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,637
- What?
- French letter.

409
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,711
I won't let you put it in me
without wearing one.

410
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,950
That's a matter of life and death.
You're a nurse.

411
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,634
You wouldn't refuse comfort to a dying man.

412
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,757
At least take me someplace
where I won't get coal dust on my knees.

413
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,717
It's filthy down here.

414
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,432
All right, ladies. Show's over. Back to work.

415
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,508
Boss, you ain't gonna believe this.

416
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,353
Good evening.

417
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,149
Roundsman Sears of the 19th Precinct,
meet Bunky Collier.

418
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,077
What the fuck is this, Barrow?
Some kind of threat?

419
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,637
It's a business proposal.

420
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,271
I do business with coppers all the time.

421
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,513
The hell I need another one for?

422
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,513
Well, Roundsman Sears
is particularly well situated

423
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,750
to supply you with your stock in trade.

424
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,670
What's that? Cigars?

425
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,474
Whores.

426
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,193
The 19th Precinct is in the Tenderloin,
ain't it?

427
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,310
My boys can't walk down the sidewalk there,
it's so crowded with whores.

428
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,159
What have you got that they don't have?

429
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,593
A uniform.

430
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,470
You see, every day I arrest pretty young girls
who are down on their luck.

431
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,153
One look at a uniform
alongside the threat of incarceration

432
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,677
is all it requires for the tender young things
to agree enthusiastically

433
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,593
to any alternative I should happen to propose.

434
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,838
What does this mutt get out of the deal?

435
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,030
First of all, let me put your mind at ease.

436
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,269
I looked in on
your brother-in-law this evening

437
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,511
and the doctors assure me
he will make a full recovery.

438
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,034
Don't think you're dipping your bucket
into that well again.

439
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,114
I'll take a flat fee deducted from my debt
for every girl that Phinny recruits.

440
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,915
Beginning with the two outside.

441
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,632
Two, you say?

442
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,758
What's your name?

443
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,519
Millicent.

444
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,956
I don't normally keep coons,

445
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,196
but you have a nice figure.

446
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,872
If a customer asks,
tell him you're an octoroon, understand?

447
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,878
What's your name?

448
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,509
Alice.

449
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,317
We ain't got an Alice,
but we got a surfeit of blondes.

450
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,480
So from now on, you're a redhead.

451
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,711
The cost of the dye
to be deducted from your pay.

452
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,429
All right, girls,

453
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,232
show me the goods.

454
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,989
You'll be provided with room and board
on a weekly basis,

455
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,117
which will also be deducted from your pay.

456
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,237
Twice a month
you'll be examined by a lady doctor,

457
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,471
who will see that you are not sick or pregnant.

458
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,159
Very nice.

459
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,877
Thank you.

460
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,351
My colleague Jimmy here
will now test your level of enthusiasm.

461
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,109
Always a pleasure.

462
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,791
Neely, what are you doing here?

463
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,479
It's your mother.

464
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,435
Tell me what happened.

465
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,114
She's complained of pain in her lower back
for the past few days.

466
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,555
She's also been unable to urinate.

467
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,679
Tonight the pain intensified,
so my father asked me to fetch you.

468
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,393
What the hell
are you doing here?

469
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,989
Don't blame Dr. Thackery, Algie.

470
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,957
The captain thought your presence
would be a comfort to me.

471
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,110
Mother, you have a pain in your back?

472
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,792
Something terrible.

473
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,155
It could be appendicitis.
We need to get her to the hospital now.

474
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,959
She also has a swelling
in the area of the right kidney.

475
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,350
I think it's probably
just a cyst causing a blockage.

476
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,351
I'm going to pop it.

477
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,233
Stop!
You could rupture her appendix and kill her.

478
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,073
Nonsense.
If she had appendicitis, she'd have a fever.

479
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,555
Well, something went.

480
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,080
You gentlemen will have to excuse me now.

481
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,674
I need to pay a visit to the privy.

482
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,549
Thank you, Doctor.

483
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,872
There's probably a little blood in the stream,
but there's nothing to worry about.

484
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,108
Doctor.

485
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,680
-Is she gonna be all right?
-It was nothing serious.

486
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,829
Oh, thank God.

487
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,230
She just needs a day or two of bed rest.
Her boy can look in on her.

488
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,517
Thank you, Thack.
I was just heading back to the club.

489
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,477
Had to fold a hell of a hand to rush back here.

490
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,232
I'll walk you out.

491
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,599
Tell me, Thack,

492
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,392
how is Cornelia?

493
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,833
What do you mean?

494
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,110
How is she doing at the Knick?

495
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,031
Am I well represented by her?

496
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,908
Or am I seen as a fool
who can't say no to his little girl?

497
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,993
Anyone who views her as a little girl
does so at their own peril.

498
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,516
You haven't really answered my question.

499
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,551
You should be proud.

500
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,632
In 10 years,
she could be running the whole hospital.

501
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,794
In 10 years, I expect
to have a gaggle of grandchildren.

502
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,838
I hope she understands
that when she's married,

503
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,276
she'll have other responsibilities
to her husband.

504
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,634
Does she know that?

505
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,188
Because if not,
it could be one hell of a conversation.

506
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,949
If you'd be willing to have it with her,
I would be forever in your debt.

507
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,076
You're already in my debt.

508
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,113
Nicaragua.

509
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,229
Yes.

510
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,309
Doesn't seem possible, but feels hotter here
than it ever did down there.

511
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,118
-It's all the buildings.
-Oh, is that so?

512
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,077
They capture the heat.

513
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,835
How long have you been standing there?

514
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,797
Only a moment.

515
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,713
You look quite natural with children.

516
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:30,638
I wanted to ask you, Nurse,
if you've ever visited the Eden Musée before.

517
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,110
The dime museum on 23rd Street?
No, I haven't.

518
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,635
Well, they have a lovely winter garden
that I feel like you would enjoy.

519
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,269
You can have an ice cream
and listen to music.

520
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,909
I think I'd like the waxworks
at the Chamber of Horrors.

521
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,709
Do you enjoy being frightened?

522
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,429
I think it's delicious,
so long as it's not really happening.

523
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,073
Maybe we can go there one afternoon.

524
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,230
Dr. Chickering, I need you.

525
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,549
It's a previa case.

526
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,474
I need a doctor to order the patient
into surgery immediately.

527
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,957
- Mrs...
- Lefkowitz.

528
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,837
Lefkowitz. Look up, please, Mrs. Lefkowitz.

529
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,114
Great. Thank you.

530
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,719
How long have you been in labor?

531
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,677
Since 8:00 this morning.

532
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,594
I just need you to order her into surgery.
I'm not allowed to.

533
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,756
You're wasting time, Bertie.

534
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,513
Right. Nurse Elkins, fetch Dr. Thackery.
Tell him we have an extreme case of previa.

535
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,195
Where's Gallinger?

536
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,713
No one's seen him.

537
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,712
Then tell Dr. Chickering he'll be assisting.

538
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,515
We ready? Patient all prepped?

539
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,588
Of course.

540
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,148
You look a tad rattled, Bertie.

541
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,791
I wasn't eager to see another previa patient
after Dr. Christiansen.

542
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,151
Listen to me.

543
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,754
Christiansen was brilliant, but he froze.

544
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,796
You know, he lost his nerve. We won't.

545
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,954
We make a bigger incision.

546
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,600
We have the electric cauterizer,
which is faster.

547
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,275
We can save this mother.
We can save this child.

548
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,918
We can do this.

549
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,194
How long?

550
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,112
Seventy-two seconds.

551
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,357
I don't think
anybody could have done it faster.

552
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,076
We did everything right.

553
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,871
Did you hear about the Gallingers?

554
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,877
Little Lillian's sick.

555
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,752
Her head's at an unusual angle
and there's a slight swelling of the forehead.

556
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,831
We think it's meningitis.

557
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,835
How the hell was she exposed to that?

558
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,712
Everett had a patient with multiple rat bites.

559
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,394
Just another Tuesday at the Knick.

560
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,278
It's a beauty, isn't it?

561
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,151
It's called a Rambler.

562
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,911
First thing I did when I moved here,

563
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,072
even before I found a place to stay,
was to buy it.

564
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,311
Comes in five colors.

565
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,152
And you chose blue.

566
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,749
I did.

567
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,558
To match your eyes.

568
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,918
I like riding in the city.

569
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,796
Makes me feel like I'm part of it.

570
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,759
I saw you on it this morning.
You didn't look like you were part of anything.

571
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,192
You looked free.

572
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,516
I quite envied you that.

573
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,113
Can you ride a bicycle?

574
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,638
Is it like riding a horse? I can ride a horse.

575
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,552
Not in the least.

576
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,516
Then, no, I can't.

577
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,557
Then let me teach you.

578
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,430
It's harder than it looks at first,
but it's the easiest thing in the world.

579
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,030
Hence the saying,
it's as easy as falling off a bicycle.

580
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,480
You're thinking too much.

581
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,312
Why don't you try singing a song?

582
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,958
It'll help distract you.

583
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,268
A song?

584
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,754
Turn to the side. You're falling.

585
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,672
Boys and girls together

586
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,550
Me and Mamie O’Rourke

587
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,548
Boys and girls together

588
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,677
Boys and girls together

589
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,354
Me and Mamie O’Rourke

590
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,916
The light fantastic on the...

591
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,511
You're a good teacher.

592
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,874
You're a good student.

593
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,117
East Side, West Side

594
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,949
All around the town

595
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,589
The tots sang...
