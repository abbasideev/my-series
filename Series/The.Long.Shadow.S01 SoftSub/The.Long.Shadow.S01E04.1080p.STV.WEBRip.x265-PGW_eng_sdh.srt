00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,639
MAN: Can you describe him for us,
love?

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,079
A white man in a white car.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,759
He left tyre tracks.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,319
We find that car,
we find the killer.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,959
It's yours, George.
The whole investigation.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,759
Hobson, Domaille in Bradford.
They all work for you.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,359
Five. Five dead women.

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,919
This one, a normal lass from
a good family. Done nothing wrong.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,759
And she is lying there
because you and Dennis, you failed.

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,639
I give you my word
that I will catch this animal.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,599
And you have that from me,
Mr MacDonald.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,279
They put everything into Leeds,
so he starts killing in Bradford.

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,199
They put everything into Bradford,

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,799
he comes back here,
where he started.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,559
He could be watching us right now.

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,279
If he can see us,
he should be panicking.

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,880
Cos he's looking at the two men
who are gonna catch him.

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,120
BIRDSONG

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,280
MOTOR WHIRS

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,400
George!

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,120
George!

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,880
Phone. It's Dick Holland.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,199
'Do I want to hear this?

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,119
PHONE: 'Bradford again. Aged 42.

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,959
'Two gypsy women
found her first thing.'

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,359
Have you spoken to David Gee?
No.

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,159
Well, call him.
Arrange a postmortem.

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,360
'No, no, George.
That... That's why I'm ringing.

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,920
'This one's survived.'

30
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,319
Her name's Maureen Long.

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,839
Hit with a hammer. Stab wounds
to the body and left for dead.

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,919
She's not quite with it.

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,159
All she knows is she's been
attacked, and we want a word.

34
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,279
Right. Well, let's keep it that way.
No mention of the Ripper, all right?

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,840
Where is she?
Down here.

36
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,600
'You were at the Mecca last night.'

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,240
Left just as it was finishing.
That's correct, isn't it, Maureen?

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,479
That's what you told the nurse?

39
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,040
Do you remember
where you went after that?

40
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,040
Another drink, or...

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,880
Do you remember meeting anybody?

42
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,400
Yes, love.
You do?

43
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,480
Yes, love. A fella.

44
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,400
You met a fella.

45
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,799
And had this fella
been in the Mecca too?

46
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,480
Or any of these pubs
you'd been into?

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,359
But you remember him being outside?

48
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,279
Do you remember what he looked like,
Maureen, mm?

49
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,960
Like his build, or...
the colour of his hair, or...

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,639
I'm trying to think.

51
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,359
But you spoke to him, right?

52
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,119
Yes, love. In t'car.

53
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,720
Oh, so he had a car?

54
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,319
He drove you in his car?

55
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,839
That's how you got
to the caravan site

56
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,520
where they found you
this morning, hmm?

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,680
So, what sort of car were it? Hmm?
What make or colour?

58
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,080
I'm not good with cars.

59
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,959
Had you been drinking?

60
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,559
You know, drinking more than
you should?

61
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,840
How much is more than I should?

62
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,439
You got in the car with him.
So you must've spoke to him.

63
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,559
But these questions are important,
Maureen,

64
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,239
so I need you to think hard.

65
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,559
All right?

66
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,759
The car?

67
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,880
What he sounded like,
what he looked like.

68
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,520
White.
What, the man was white?

69
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,479
No.

70
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,959
The car were white.

71
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,280
Or...

72
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,720
Or were it green?

73
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,120
Wh... Why? What's he done to me?

74
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,879
TV PLAYS

75
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,480
Right.
Oh, thank you, love.

76
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,919
Your dad'd never have worn a beard.

77
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,719
Well, that's the trend these days.
Lot of men my age with beards.

78
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,559
Right, look, there's biscuits there.
Tea in t'pot.

79
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,919
Anything else before I go?
Do you want me changing sides?

80
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,719
No, no, I'll stay on three
until Coronation Street,

81
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,399
and then that'll be me, then.

82
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,519
Right, then. Don't wait up.

83
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,640
Oh, be careful, won't you, love?
Yeah, all right.

84
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,079
Morning.
Morning, Sir. Morning, Sir.

85
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,999
Oh, this is good. Morning.
Morning.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,319
This is what I like to see.

87
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,599
Jim?

88
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,559
Meg, could you bring
some tea through?

89
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,879
Yes, Sir.

90
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,399
Gentlemen. Very sorry to keep you.

91
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,999
Come through.

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,039
Donkey wallopers.

93
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,639
Aye. Yeah, I know, lad.

94
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,719
Now, McCann,
Jackson, Richardson.

95
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,839
Then it's Atkinson in Bradford.

96
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,039
Then he makes a mistake,
kills a decent lass.

97
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,839
Jane MacDonald, back in Leeds.

98
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,519
And then... Bradford again.

99
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,919
Maureen Long.
Another prostitute?

100
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,159
We're not sure.

101
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,999
Well, she's in that bracket,
in't she? Out on her own.

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,639
Going around pubs and clubs.

103
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,359
Getting in cars with men.
Yeah, men she doesn't know.

104
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,799
Ah, doesn't make her a prostitute.

105
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,479
Prostitute, good time girl,
whatever you wanna call it.

106
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,959
Jim's right. She could just
have been getting a cab home.

107
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,719
Cabbies.

108
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,479
Cabbies are out late at night.
Aye, nobody thinks anything of it.

109
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,479
Look, Dennis and I
looked into cabbies.

110
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,239
Looked at bloody hundreds
of cabbies.

111
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,959
Yeah, well, we'll look at it again.

112
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,559
No, it's a dead end.

113
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,159
No, we need to stay focused
on car tyres.

114
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,919
Tina Atkinson took lots of cabs.
All over Bradford.

115
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,359
We got that from neighbours
in her flats.

116
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,639
Cabbies have a reason to travel,
don't they? Leeds, Bradford.

117
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,679
Both of 'em,
and everywhere in between.

118
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,359
So, this is our focus.

119
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,359
Cabbies in Leeds.
Cabbies in Bradford.

120
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,519
You, you check the drivers,

121
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,999
and Jim, whilst you're at it,
you can check the tyres.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,440
All right? Off you go.

123
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,279
TV: 'He left Miss Long for dead.

124
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,319
'The fact that she survived
is to my advantage and not to his.

125
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,599
'So possibly, you may
have stumbled on a big break, then?

126
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,159
'Well, I sincerely hope so.

127
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,599
'There is a belief amongst this team
that this man,

128
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,159
'the Ripper, as he's become known,
has started to make mistakes.

129
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,079
'And it's when an individual
of this nature makes mistakes

130
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,080
'that the net begins to close.'

131
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,159
Y'all right?
Y'all right, love?

132
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,159
Er, how much to Thornbury?

133
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,200
Only I've, er...
I've not got much on me.

134
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,199
Yeah, don't worry.
We'll get you there.

135
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,440
Come on.
Get in before I change me mind.

136
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,279
Andy! Andy! This one'll take us.

137
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,960
Right.
See you, mate.

138
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,439
You, er... sure you're all right
going all the way to Thornbury?

139
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,280
Yeah, no problem, love.

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,079
Hi, I'm calling
from Milgarth Police Station.

141
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,119
We need your help
with a local murder enquiry.

142
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,399
Yeah, we're calling
all cab companies in the area,

143
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,479
not just yours.

144
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,559
OK, well first of all, we need
all cab numbers from 1975. Yep.

145
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,959
Names of all your drivers,
registered and unregistered.

146
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,319
I understand it's confidential,
but you see,

147
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,240
this information is integral
to our murder investigation.

148
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,359
What's going on?

149
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,479
Cabbies.
Yeah, we did cabbies last year.

150
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,079
Yeah, well, we're doing 'em again.
And we're doing 'em properly.

151
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,919
Right. Let's do this in a way
you'll all understand.

152
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,159
I'll have a nice, orderly line
down this side.

153
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,720
When you get to t'front,
you're t'next cabbie to go.

154
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,079
Do you work late at night?

155
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,439
Me? No. I love my beauty sleep.

156
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,759
Says here you were working
the night of June 25th.

157
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,279
I don't think so.

158
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,679
No, no, no, I'm not asking you.
I'm reminding you.

159
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,360
Cos on that night,
a very serious crime took place.

160
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,999
Where do you operate?
Leeds, mainly. Bit of Wakefield.

161
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,759
'Bout Bradford?
Don't bother with Bradford.

162
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,479
Yeah, but you must go there
sometimes.

163
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,919
Hardly ever.
That's what I'm saying.

164
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,159
Other drivers
have got Bradford sewn up.

165
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,079
Ever been to Lumb Lane?
Bradford? Aye.

166
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,559
How about Spencer Place, Leeds?
Yeah.

167
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,959
Roundhay Park?
Yeah.

168
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,919
How about Reginald Terrace?
Reginald Terrace... That's...

169
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,639
Where's that?
Chapeltown.

170
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,119
Right.

171
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,759
There's an adventure playground
there.

172
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,599
A sixteen-year-old lass were found
dead in that playground in March.

173
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,799
Killed with a claw hammer.
Just trying to jog your memory.

174
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,079
I might have been there.
Leeds, Bradford...

175
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,839
Huddersfield, Manchester.

176
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,919
You see, funnily enough,
as a cabbie,

177
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,239
you tend to go all over.

178
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,399
What colour's your cab, Ray?
When?

179
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,119
Look, I went through all this
when you brought me in last year.

180
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,679
I drive a red Cortina.

181
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,800
Up until September just gone,
I've always driven a brown Avenger.

182
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,439
Do you lot not write
this sort of thing down?

183
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,079
You go with prostitutes, Leroy?

184
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,639
HE SNORTS
Nah, man.

185
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,039
I have a girlfriend.
She give me everything I need.

186
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,999
Just don't tell my wife.
HE LAUGHS

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,239
We're after The Ripper here, Leroy.

188
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,959
You wanna wipe that stupid smirk
off your face?

189
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,519
You work nights.

190
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,719
You've worked both the nights
we've spoke about.

191
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,959
That's not in any doubt.

192
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Do you ever pick up prostitutes?

193
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,599
You've asked me that before.
Never met you before.

194
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,799
Well, not you personally,
but you lot.

195
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,559
You've had me in here
asking me that before.

196
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,159
So, go on, then.
Do you or don't you?

197
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,559
I pick 'em up,

198
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,159
but only to take 'em
where they need to go.

199
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,439
What, that's all it is?

200
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,040
Their money's as good
as anyone else's.

201
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,119
You always been a cabbie?

202
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,799
Aye.
What colour's your cab?

203
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,160
Why do you ask?
Why not?

204
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,400
White.

205
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,839
And what colour were it
on these dates, nights in question?

206
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,879
White.

207
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,479
It's the exact same car?

208
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,759
Well, I might've changed a tyre
or two, but yeah.

209
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,920
White Cortina.

210
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,279
So, there's a woman from Bradford
who survived the Ripper.

211
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,879
You'll be aware of that, yes?

212
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,439
Yes, Sir.

213
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,759
Maureen Long, Sir.
But she couldn't remember 'owt.

214
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,200
That's right. Well done.

215
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,639
So she's gonna need
her memory jogging.

216
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,439
When she's back from hospital,
recovered of course,

217
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,919
you're taking her out.
Taking her out...?

218
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,959
Saturday night, you and her.
Buying her drinks.

219
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,079
Taking her to all her usual places,
retracing her steps.

220
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,159
Don't worry,
DC Laptew will come with you.

221
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,559
I'll keep an eye on things.

222
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,399
And if anyone starts asking
questions, then Maureen's your mate,

223
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,080
Andrew here's your husband.

224
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,560
SHE SIGHS
I've already got a husband.

225
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,360
Then he's your bit on the side.

226
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,359
Look, the aim here is to see
if it brings anything back.

227
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,999
Details, faces.

228
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So, you make sure
she has a good look round. OK?

229
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,519
That's five attacks in a row now.

230
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,960
All on a Saturday night.

231
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,960
So there's even a chance
you might see the Ripper himself.

232
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,079
His car's white. Now, we all know
Maureen Long's had a skinful,

233
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,319
but that's a definite start.

234
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,199
Add to that the fact
he were in Bradford

235
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,479
the night she were attacked.

236
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,119
He were in Leeds the night of
the MacDonald murder, working late.

237
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,639
He admits to driving all over...

238
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,079
And to changing his tyres.
And we've had him in once before.

239
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,879
But here's the bit I like.
He lives in Drighlington.

240
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,399
Where's that?
It's between Bradford and Leeds.

241
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,999
Now, we don't wanna say
"We're excited, George," but...

242
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,479
But you're "excited, George".

243
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,719
So, what do you say we bring him in,
eh?

244
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,159
Nick him. Get stuck into him.
Does he know we feel like that?

245
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,119
No, no, Sir. We said we'd come back
to him if we had any more questions.

246
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,039
Good. Cos there's not enough.
Not yet.

247
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,839
He doesn't know
that we're onto him,

248
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,559
that gives us more time
to do some digging.

249
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,879
Find out where he goes.
What he's up to.

250
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,920
Good work, though.

251
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,280
We'll get someone on him.

252
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,199
How are you, all right?
Come on, get in.

253
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,479
I've not told you
where I'm going yet.

254
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,239
I've a punter up Potternewton Park,
but he's not got a car.

255
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,240
What do you think? Reckon we can do
the same as last time?

256
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,279
CLEARS THROAT

257
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,840
Yeah, all right. Come on.

258
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,759
So, did he get what he wanted?

259
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,400
SHE SCOFFS
What?

260
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,120
Don't pretend you weren't watching.

261
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,400
So, what about you?

262
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,760
Have you got everything you wanted?

263
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,080
Yeah.

264
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,759
There.

265
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,440
No, no, that's... That's too much.
No, for last time an' all.

266
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,360
Thanks.

267
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,680
See you.
Take care.

268
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,280
POLICE RADIO: 04. On my way.

269
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,600
MUFFLED VOICES OVER RADIO

270
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,919
We've been tracking him for weeks.

271
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,879
Last night he were in Spencer Place,
Leopold Street, Chapeltown Road

272
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,039
until three in t'morning.

273
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,319
And then, last Friday, he was
spotted in Bradford, Church Street.

274
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,799
So he's in all the right areas...

275
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,439
But he's not done anything wrong
since surveillance started.

276
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,479
No, no, Sir,
not since we've been tailing him.

277
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,759
Well, mind you, nor's the Ripper.
So we stay on him.

278
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,799
Right.

279
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,479
Sir, there's a Jack Ridgway for you.
Who?

280
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,879
Central Manchester Police.

281
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,879
Aye, well,
tell him I'll call him back.

282
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,920
Oh, I can't, Sir, he's downstairs.

283
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,800
Right.

284
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,400
Are you Ridgway?

285
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,319
Sorry to come over all this way,
Mr Oldfield,

286
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,440
but I thought it best
done in person, you know?

287
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,280
But it's...
it's this Ripper of yours.

288
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,920
We think he's been over our way.

289
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,959
'Her name's Jean Jordan.'

290
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,799
Two lads found her
up on the allotments in Chorlton.

291
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,679
It's a place where the prostitutes
take the punters, you know?

292
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,559
She'd had a blow on the head
with a blunt object.

293
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,839
Looks like some kind of tool,
she'd been stabbed in the body,

294
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,799
and then she had this long cut.

295
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,119
Right down here, like that,
like length of my tie.

296
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,079
And our pathologist got on the phone
to your chap.

297
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,199
David Gee?
Yeah, that's-that's the one.

298
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,719
And he said with the injuries,

299
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,040
the two weapons, the order that
they're done in, they're identical.

300
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,679
Look, I-I don't wanna
tread on toes here.

301
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Well, that's what you're doing.

302
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,879
So, it's not just Leeds.
It's Bradford,

303
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,079
and now he goes to Manchester
for t'first time.

304
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,560
It might not be his first time.

305
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,800
What, Harrison, you mean?
Mm.

306
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,039
Er... No, we ruled them out.

307
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,159
Harrison?
Joan Harrison.

308
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,959
She were in, er...
Where were it? Preston?

309
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,039
Preston.
Preston, yeah.

310
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,839
Back in, er... '75.
That's right.

311
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,120
Hoban had us look into it
and decided it weren't linked.

312
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,399
Oh, aye? Why?

313
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,520
She were killed indoors.

314
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,519
Well, Atkinson were killed indoors.

315
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,480
Yes, but this was before Atkinson.
And that is why we ruled it out.

316
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,799
Yeah, but why would a man

317
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,159
who's killing prostitutes
in Bradford and Leeds

318
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,079
drive all the way out
to some muddy lane in Chorlton,

319
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,839
just to do the same thing
to some prostitute there?

320
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,879
Apart from anything,

321
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,960
who's got the time
to make that journey, right?

322
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,800
ENGINE RUMBLES

323
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,120
Right, get in there, lads.

324
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,439
BANGING ON DOOR

325
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,359
OFFICER: Excuse me, miss.
Hey!

326
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,959
You!
Hey! On your feet.

327
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,200
You can't go in there.

328
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,199
That the cab?
Yes, Sir.

329
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,439
Right, test it. Outside, inside,
just take it to bits,

330
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,999
and then test it again.

331
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,119
EXHALES

332
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,159
You two with me.

333
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,519
OFFICER: Terence!
Terry?

334
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,000
TERENCE: It's OK, Mam. It's OK, Mam.

335
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,439
He's not nothing.
You can't just take him like this.

336
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,159
What's he done?
You'll hurt my wrists now.

337
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,479
OFFICER: Move!
Agh!

338
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,000
RADIO CHATTER

339
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,399
TERENCE: My mother is 67 years old.

340
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,840
She is frail, she's not all there,
and she did not need to see that.

341
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,279
Worried about her feelings, are we?

342
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,719
The feelings of a vulnerable,
innocent woman?

343
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,760
How were Manchester?

344
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,519
What you on about?
You said you go to Manchester.

345
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,399
Yeah, sometimes.

346
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,439
So how were it? How did it feel?
What are you on about?

347
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,439
Doing a whore over there
last Saturday?

348
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,719
Killing one of theirs?

349
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,319
Nobody watching you over there,
is there? Must be a relief.

350
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,119
No pigs in cars following you about.

351
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,079
Bet you felt like you were on your
fucking holidays, didn't you, fella?

352
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,479
Why is it...?

353
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,599
I'm sorry to bombard you
with questions, by the way.

354
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,399
Why is it that on four occasions

355
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,759
when The Ripper's killed these
women, you are in the same town?

356
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,200
Leeds, Bradford, Leeds.
Every single time. Why?

357
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,680
I mean, I know what I think,
but why don't you go first?

358
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,359
I wasn't in Manchester, Saturday.
Where were you then?

359
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,120
I stopped at home.
And who's gonna vouch for that?

360
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,799
My ma.
Come on!

361
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,399
Your ma?

362
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,519
But your ma's 67.
You can't have it both ways.

363
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,080
Your ma's frail,
your ma's not all there.

364
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,319
We're gonna match it.
D'you understand?

365
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,559
There's mud all around them
allotments where you took her...

366
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,119
where you killed her. Jean Jordan...

367
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,199
Tried to cut off her head.

368
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,960
Well, that mud gets everywhere.

369
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,720
So we're gonna match it
to the mud on your car.

370
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,480
Jim.

371
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,959
Got nothing so far.

372
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,679
Tested his house, tools, clothes.

373
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,639
Did his car last night,
tyres are brand new,

374
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,999
so they won't match
with the Richardson scene.

375
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,040
Right.

376
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,639
What about prints?

377
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,079
One print from any victim,

378
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,039
that's all we need,
or a... single fibre.

379
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,999
So far he's clean as a whistle.

380
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,199
But then maybe that's it, you know.

381
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,199
Maybe that shows
he's got something to hide.

382
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,799
Is Oldfield pressing charges?

383
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,919
He can't.

384
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,479
It's all still circumstantial,
isn't it?

this Ripper's got a white car,

to talk to me,

397
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,640
cos I've got a white car,

00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,919
TERENCE: Man, I've told you,
I haven't done anything!

515
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,959
I haven't done anything!
What are you doing to him?

516
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,239
Please help... Ah!

517
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,359
He's after him!
Hey, what you doing!

518
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,039
Eh, all right love, back inside, OK?

519
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,480
You're hurting me!
You're hurting me!

520
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,079
All right, let's spin this lot
round, get him up to Bishopsgarth.

521
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,479
Bishopsgarth? It's deserted.

522
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,999
Exactly. What we need now is time.

523
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,079
Put the pressure on.
Get a confession.

524
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,519
Can't do that.

525
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,480
Look, he knows he's done it.
We just need to get him to say it.

526
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,119
Now, I promised Wilf MacDonald
I'd nail him,

527
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,360
so that's what we're doing.

528
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,479
It's not just me saying it.

529
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,959
It's not just me and Dick
and my whole team, it's the victims.

530
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,280
The women that you attacked.

531
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,560
Who's that?

532
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,719
Don't know.

533
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,319
I'll tell you who it is.

534
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,760
It's the Ripper.

535
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,439
See, we asked these women
to describe the man

536
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,839
who attacked them.

537
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,879
And then we do a drawing.

538
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,080
And that drawing...

539
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,800
..is you.

540
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,920
So, you're in the same car...

541
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,320
..you're in the same places...

542
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,400
..and now...

543
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,279
..the same face.

544
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,280
How do you explain that?

545
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,159
I can't.
Cos you're the Ripper?

546
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,240
I'm not.
You're the Ripper. No!

547
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,839
You know, I think that
you don't even know that it's you.

548
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,920
Mm. Cos you're confused.

549
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,480
And that's all right.
Mm. Course you are.

550
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,960
Well, don't worry.

551
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,360
Cos I'm here to help you.

552
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,400
Mm?

553
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,200
Cos it's over now, it's done.

554
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,000
Hm. All we need to do
is just talk through it.

555
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,799
Do you want me to tell your mum?

556
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,520
Is that it? I can do that for you,
don't worry.

557
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,320
And I don't have to go
into the details, don't have to...

558
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,040
..tell her all those things
that you did to those women.

559
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,080
Cos I know you didn't mean it.

560
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,680
They were an accident.

561
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,919
I-I didn't.

562
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,480
Don't fucking lie!

563
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,919
Just gonna keep on denying it
till we take him home.

564
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,039
Who said anything
about taking him home?

565
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,279
We'll keep him here overnight.
Can't do that.

566
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,639
Over two nights...
Two nights? George, come on.

567
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,879
Listen. When he'd stopped stabbing
Jane MacDonald

568
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,279
who had that knife on her t-shirt...

569
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,799
So we keep him here.

570
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,520
We keep on keeping him here
till he coughs for it.

571
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,479
Ah!

572
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,360
There he is. Too punctual
for his own good, our Dennis.

573
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,839
There's one for you.
Ah.

574
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,039
You sip on that.

575
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,119
There's just a couple of things
I want to talk to you about. It's...

576
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,439
some ideas I've had.

577
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,119
As long as it's not about the case.

578
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,920
I get enough of that at work.

579
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,039

INDISTINCT CHATTER

WOMAN WHISPERING: Calm down.

581
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,920
Don't know.

582
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,439
MAN WHISPERING: The same person
every time. The same person.

583
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,880
People are looking.

584
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,680
What you staring at?

585
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,119
Just wondering if she's all right.

586
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,799
Yeah?

587
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,480
And if she weren't,
what would you be doing about it?

588
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,519
Nothing.

589
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,160
Just leave it, please.
That's what.

590
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,559
Calm down.

591
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,039
This, um, this new lad Botham,
Bo-tham...

592
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,999
Does he get to start
at Trent Bridge, or doesn't he?

593
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,159
Dennis?

594
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,400
You OK?

595
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,359
Still taking your insulin?

596
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,799
Because this is when it starts.

597
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,279
30 years on the job,
all booze and bad eating,

598
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,760
the moment you stop,
that's when it gets you...

599
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,999
..creeps up behind you...
No.

600
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,919
So, what d'you mean "no"?

601
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,360
No, he doesn't start
at Trent Bridge.

602
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,560
He's not got the experience.

603
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,040
Hm.

604
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,039
DICK: Sat exams here once.

605
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,320
Not been back since, thank God.

606
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,800
I did my detective course
in that room.

607
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,519
Margaret were pregnant with Gillian
and...

608
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,600
I got the call to say
she'd gone into labour.

609
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,200
But they wouldn't let me go.

610
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,559
Said, "What type of detective
would I make

611
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,560
"if I went running off to the wife
all the time?"

612
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,599
I said, "Isn't that what you want
from a detectives, eh?

613
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,119
"People who care?"

614
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,439
Otherwise what's he doing it for?

615
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,840
Exactly.

616
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,200
So they let you go?

617
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,480
Did they bollocks?

618
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,960
We can keep you here
as long as we like.

619
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,160
Don't bother us.

620
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,639
So, it don't matter.

621
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,040
The longer you're here,
safer everyone is.

622
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,360
So what about that question
I asked you before, hm?

623
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,719
Why stab Emily Jackson 52 times?

624
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,840
That's more than the others.

625
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,720
What had she done to deserve that,
eh?

626
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,840
Hm?

627
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,600
Come on.

628
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,320
