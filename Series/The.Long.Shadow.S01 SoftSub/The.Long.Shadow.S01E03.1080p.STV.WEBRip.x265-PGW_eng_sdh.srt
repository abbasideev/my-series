1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,759
Well, I find if you don't solve a
murder in the first couple of days,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,599
it's an uphill struggle after that,
isn't it?

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,759
Or maybe that's just me.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,719
<font color="yellow">You've never caught a man</font>
<font color="yellow">like this before.</font>

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,319
<font color="cyan">You haven't caught him either.</font>

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,519
<font color="lime">Those murders</font>
<font color="lime">are still West Yorkshire, Dennis.</font>

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,679
<font color="lime">You just won't be</font>
<font color="lime">in day-to-day charge is all.</font>

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,479
<font color="yellow">And who will?</font>

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,119
How long you been on the game,
Marcella?

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,719
<font color="yellow">That's not what I do.</font>

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,559
'She were attacked,
hit on t'back of t'head.'

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,479
That is it.
That is the only connection.

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,239
'If someone puts out
an appeal on a man

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,479
'who has absolutely nothing to do
with any of these crimes,

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,839
'we'd send everybody off
down the wrong road

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,360
'to create space for that bastard
to kill again.'

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,319
Well, this man has taken the lives
of three young women.

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,599
Three brutal and savage murders
in the space of 18 months.

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,359
So, let me say this.

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,159
There are 5,000 men
who work in this police force.

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,999
And each time this man commits
one of these unspeakable crimes,

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,199
the hunger and the desire
of these men only increases.

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,319
MY desire only increases.

24
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,199
So...

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,680
I would caution
this individual as follows.

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,280
You will be caught,
and you will be apprehended.

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,759
I have lasses manning every phone

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,560
and men on every corner.

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,680
Leeds is watching,
and Leeds is waiting.

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,840
And Leeds is ready.

31
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,319
Was that all right?
<font color="lime">Yep, it was great.</font>

32
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,479
I think I could do one more,

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,199
with just a little bit more,
er... intensity.

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,319
<font color="lime">OK.</font>
All right?

35
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,959
CLEARS THROAT
Yeah, thank you.

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,360
Can I just get some water?

37
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,360

ON RADIO

39
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,239
So, it's eight quid
to get down there.

40
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,759
That's your return ticket.

41
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,359
There's a hotel you can stay in
in Bayswater,

42
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,439
if you need it. And then...

43
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,359
it is 30 quid a time.

44
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,680
<font color="yellow">Thirteen?</font>
Thirty. Three-oh.

45
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,119
That's London, love.

46
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,879
And it can go higher.
Especially if you go with an Arab.

47
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,359
I'm serious, one week down there

48
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,280
is the same
as one entire month up here.

49
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,359
It's true.
<font color="cyan">Don't put ideas in her head.</font>

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,079
Well, why not?

51
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,359
If it's a good idea,
why not put it in her head?

52
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,480
<font color="cyan">Because it's daft.</font>

53
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,120
<font color="yellow">Right...</font>

54
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,680
<font color="yellow">Work.</font>

55
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,719
<font color="yellow">I'd do well with the Arabs, me.</font>

56
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,439
<font color="yellow">Got that coat coming.</font>
<font color="cyan">What coat?</font>

57
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,720
<font color="yellow">One of them new-style coats.</font>
<font color="yellow">They'd like that.</font>

58
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,519
<font color="yellow">Long, down to about there.</font>

59
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,039
<font color="yellow">Fur all round here</font>
<font color="yellow">and on there like that.</font>

60
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,799
Like an Afghan coat?
<font color="yellow">Afghan, that's it.</font>

61
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,159
They're not new.

62
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,160
<font color="yellow">He says if I keep tipping up</font>
<font color="yellow">like I have been, I can get one.</font>

63
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,879
They're not new, are they?

64
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,960
<font color="cyan">Don't know about new,</font>
<font color="cyan">they aren't Arab.</font>

65
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,999
<font color="yellow">Business?</font>

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,559
How much?

67
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,240
<font color="yellow">Five for 20 minutes</font>
<font color="yellow">or as soon as you're finished.</font>

68
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,800
<font color="yellow">You got the money on you?</font>
Aye.

69
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,920
<font color="yellow">Through to the back.</font>

I just...

73
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,120
<font color="yellow">You just want a suck?</font>

78
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,600
I'm not like that.

79
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,760
<font color="yellow">Like what?</font>
I don't do this.

80
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,679
<font color="yellow">Do you not?</font>

81
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,639
I've got three kids.
They're everything to me.

82
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,440
<font color="yellow">Can you start the car, please?</font>

83
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,719
I hate myself.

84
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,360
<font color="yellow">Can you start the car, please?</font>

85
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,200
ENGINE STARTS

86
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,679
You should stop what you're doing.

87
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,320
You know that, don't you?

88
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,999
I'd never have pulled over

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,280
if you hadn't been
showing yourself off like that.

90
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,959
Dirty little bitch.

91
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,280
Right, get out.

92
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,040
<font color="yellow">Not here. Back where you got me.</font>

93
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,680
<font color="yellow">Right, then. Thanks for coming (!)</font>

94
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,319
<font color="yellow">Summer's the best time.</font>
<font color="cyan">'Ey?</font>

95
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,279
<font color="yellow">I were just thinking,</font>
<font color="yellow">summer's the time to buy it</font>

96
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,879
<font color="yellow">cos the coats'll all be in sale.</font>

97
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,080
<font color="cyan">Oh.</font>

98
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,719
<font color="cyan">Listen...</font>

99
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,239
<font color="cyan">London.</font>

100
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,039
<font color="cyan">Don't even think about it.</font>
<font color="yellow">Thirty quid a go.</font>

101
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,000
<font color="cyan">Forget thirty quid a go.</font>
<font color="yellow">I'm allowed to ask him.</font>

102
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,599
<font color="cyan">Get it out your head, yeah?</font>

103
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,880
<font color="cyan">You're here. Your kid's here.</font>

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,560
<font color="cyan">You're tipping up.</font>
<font color="cyan">And that is all he cares about.</font>

105
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,240
<font color="yellow">I can still ask.</font>

106
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,800
<font color="cyan">You all right?</font>

107
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,399
HOLLAND: <font color="cyan">Right, it's taking forever,</font>
<font color="cyan">finding this car.</font>

108
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,359
<font color="cyan">First, we've gotta check what cars</font>

109
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,079
<font color="cyan">actually fit</font>
<font color="cyan">those tyres' make, model,</font>

110
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,439
<font color="cyan">and then we've gotta go</font>
<font color="cyan">and inspect them all individually.</font>

111
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,839
So, inspect them all individually.

112
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,079
In the meantime, let's keep
all eyes peeled on Chapeltown.

113
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,159
What were it, 1,300 statements?
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

114
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,639
One of our lads'll clock him
eventually.

115
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,439
Simple law of averages.

116
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,280
<font color="yellow">See, what you really want...</font>

117
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,839
No, go on. Go on.

118
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,319
<font color="yellow">Well, what you really want is</font>
<font color="yellow">to be with the prossies themselves.</font>

119
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,839
<font color="yellow">They're out there all night,</font>
<font color="yellow">they see these punters close up.</font>

120
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,599
Tarts don't talk, Les.
You know that.

121
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,680
Even in times like this.

122
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,199
<font color="yellow">Well, what I mean is,</font>

123
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,879
<font color="yellow">it's all very well having lads</font>
<font color="yellow">sitting around in unmarked cars.</font>

124
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,559
<font color="yellow">When he sees them, he's off,</font>
<font color="yellow">isn't he?</font>

125
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,759
<font color="yellow">He's thought better of it.</font>

126
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,039
<font color="yellow">It's the women he doesn't hide from.</font>

127
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,840
<font color="yellow">So what you want</font>
<font color="yellow">is someone in their shoes.</font>

128
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,080
<font color="cyan">You gonna volunteer?</font>

129
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,600
<font color="cyan">I could see you in a skirt, Les.</font>

130
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,519
DR CAPLIN: No other symptoms?
Just the headaches?

131
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,520
And are they getting any better,
or are they as bad as before?

132
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,719
<font color="yellow">Worse.</font>

133
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,720
Worse in terms of how long they last
or how much they hurt?

134
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,640
Or both?

135
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,400
Mind if I take a look?

136
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,880
Tilt your head towards me.

137
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,599
<font color="yellow">I wish he killed me.</font>

138
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,319
Now, you mustn't say that.
<font color="yellow">Come back and kill me.</font>

139
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,680
Marcella.

140
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,000
They're healing well.

141
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,399
You do know there's compensation
you can apply for?

142
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,919
Has anyone ever told you?

143
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,599
Criminal injury compensation,
I think it's called.

144
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,359
I had a lady come in, a girl.
She was assaulted in the street.

145
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,960
<font color="yellow">I'm not a prostitute.</font>

146
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,920
No.

147
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,199
And nor was she.

148
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,479
I thought I had a form, but I don't.
But I can get one.

149
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,679
You can come back,

150
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,800
and we can fill it in together,
if you like?

151
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,680
And something for those headaches,
yes?

152
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,719
<font color="yellow">Before we do anything, has anyone</font>
<font color="yellow">here worked Chapeltown before?</font>

153
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,680
<font color="yellow">Either on beat or part of vice?</font>

154
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,159
<font color="yellow">Right, well, you can go.</font>
<font color="yellow">Thank you, girls.</font>

155
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,600
<font color="yellow">Jim?</font>

156
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,639
What's your name, love?
<font color="cyan">Jill.</font>

157
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,800
Jill.

158
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,800
Jill, this way, please.

159
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,319
'You a local lass?'

160
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,479
<font color="cyan">Yes, sir, from Armley.</font>

161
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,199
And how old, Jill?
<font color="cyan">Twenty-six.</font>

162
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,759
Twenty-six.

163
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,159
Twenty-six is a distant memory
for the likes of me and Les here.

164
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,040
Especially Les.
Just stand up for me.

165
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,120
<font color="yellow">Stand up, that's right.</font>

166
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,320
<font color="yellow">And pop your jacket off.</font>
<font color="yellow">Let's get a proper look at you.</font>

167
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,919
Now, Les were telling me that
you've only been with us six months.

168
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,279
Is that right?

169
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,560
<font color="yellow">You can sit back down again now.</font>

170
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,800
Do you know the investigation
that we're doing?

171
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,919
<font color="cyan">These prostitute murders, sir.</font>
That's right. Now...

172
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,759
we're looking for a volunteer

173
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,440
for a special operation
to help stop this man.

174
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,560
So, how does it feel, being selected
for something like that?

175
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,879
<font color="cyan">Me, personally?</font>

176
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,000
You, love. Out of everybody, you.

177
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,160
<font color="cyan">But what can I do</font>
<font color="cyan">that your other detectives can't?</font>

178
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,840
JIM CLEARS HIS THROAT

179
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,240
Which one?
<font color="lime">Number 3, sir.</font>

180
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,560
Professor Gee?

181
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,039
<font color="yellow">David.</font>

182
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,519
Detective Superintendent
John Domaille, Bradford.

183
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,679
<font color="yellow">It didn't start here.</font>
<font color="yellow">She's been lifted onto the bed.</font>

184
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,000
<font color="yellow">He's first attacked her here...</font>

185
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,919
<font color="yellow">..and then the murder itself</font>
<font color="yellow">has taken place</font>

186
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,119
<font color="yellow">with him on top of her on the bed.</font>

187
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,399
<font color="yellow">You might want to give Leeds a ring,</font>
<font color="yellow">get Jim Hobson down here.</font>

188
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,919
Oh, I'll be the SIO on this case.

189
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,159
<font color="yellow">It's just that</font>
<font color="yellow">there are multiple similarities -</font>

190
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,599
<font color="yellow">blows to the back of head,</font>
<font color="yellow">wounds to the body,</font>

191
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,759
<font color="yellow">and I'm assuming this flat is...</font>

192
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,280
<font color="yellow">some sort of prostitute's.</font>

193
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,040
KNOCKING ON DOOR

194
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,440
GEORGIE: Is she in?
Can I just talk to her?

195
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,599
Tell me it's not true.

196
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,200
<font color="yellow">What's not true?</font>

197
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,999
Her name's Tina.

198
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,639
Tina Atkinson.
<font color="yellow">Her proper name's Patricia.</font>

199
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,759
Yeah. She lives in these flats.
<font color="lime">Back over there with everyone else.</font>

200
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,559
We're not going nowhere.
<font color="lime">I'll not say it again!</font>

201
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,439
Can you not scream at us, please?
She's got a kid here.

202
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,639
<font color="lime">I can see that.</font>
A little boy.

203
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,239
Are you gonna scream at him and all?
<font color="yellow">Georgie. </font><font color="lime">You need to calm down.</font>

204
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,440
What?

205
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,199
No.

206
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,960
Is that her jacket?

207
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,559
SOBS: It's hers, it's hers.

208
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,479
<font color="yellow">It's all right, it's all right.</font>
<font color="yellow">Breathe.</font>

209
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,639
<font color="lime">Can you move, please?</font>
<font color="yellow">It's all right, we don't know...</font>

210
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,680
<font color="lime">Can you move!</font>
<font color="yellow">All right!</font>

211
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,600
HOLLAND:
Right, this is where they stand.

212
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,839
Look, you can see two of them
up there now, out early.

213
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,999
Irene Richardson lived up there.
Cowper Street.

214
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,159
So she'd have come down
and got in the car

215
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,359
right around there.

216
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,399
<font color="yellow">Did you get the clothes? The boots?</font>

217
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,279
Aye, and you'll need a jacket.

218
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,479
Something big enough
to put a radio in.

219
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,679
<font color="cyan">And make-up.</font>

220
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,559
Have you not got any make-up?

221
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,639
<font color="cyan">I do, sir, only...</font>

222
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,399
<font color="cyan">not always the same colours as,</font>
<font color="cyan">you know,</font>

223
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,160
<font color="cyan">you might see lasses</font>
<font color="cyan">wearing out here.</font>

224
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,119
Right.
Just make sure you keep receipts.

225
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,599
<font color="yellow">And they'll want roughing up a bit,</font>
<font color="yellow">the clothes.</font>

226
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,079
<font color="yellow">Can't come out here looking all new.</font>

227
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,599
Yeah, that's a good point,
that, Les.

228
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,239
A very good point.

229
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,559
Yeah, they'll need to look dirty.

230
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,799
Any questions?

231
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,719
<font color="cyan">Why do they work in pairs?</font>
It's safer.

232
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,320
<font color="yellow">Each one keeps an eye</font>
<font color="yellow">on where the other one's going.</font>

233
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,999
<font color="cyan">But... I won't be in pairs.</font>

234
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,039
No, you'll be in a trio.

235
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,319
Me and DI Hanley
are at t'other end of the radio.

236
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,960
You'll be fine, Jill. All right?

237
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,159
Right, pay attention,

238
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,999
cos you need to see
how they work the street,

239
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,479
otherwise you'll stick out
like a bloody sore thumb.

240
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,000
Won't she, Les?
<font color="yellow">She will.</font>

241
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,040
<font color="lime">DSI John Domaille</font>
<font color="lime">to see Chief Constable Gregory.</font>

242
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,639
Now, the man that we're looking for

243
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,039
drives a car
with two India Autoway tyres,

244
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,239
both well worn,

245
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,279
a Pneumant tyre and an Esso.

246
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,679
Now, the width between those tyres
are 46 and one quarter inch.

247
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,120
Now, the chances of any car
having that precise combination...

248
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,239
..are 159 million to one.

249
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,519
In other words, unique.

250
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,959
<font color="lime">How many cars is that?</font>

251
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,799
<font color="lime">You say only one car</font>
<font color="lime">actually has them tyres,</font>

252
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,159
<font color="lime">but how many cars COULD have them?</font>

253
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,679
<font color="lime">How many makes?</font>
Less than a hundred.

254
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,959
<font color="lime">Hundred?</font>

255
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,879
Less than.
<font color="lime">I couldn't name a hundred.</font>

256
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,719
Well, that number will come down,
Dick.

257
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,960
<font color="lime">Will it?</font>
Yes. <font color="lime">How?</font>

258
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,599
We've got all officers on the beat

259
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,759
in Leeds checking cars
wherever they go.

260
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,079
Car parks, garages and so on.

261
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,639
Hundreds of officers ruling out
hundreds of cars every day.

262
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,959
<font color="cyan">And two of these tyres</font>
<font color="cyan">were worn down, you say?</font>

263
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,679
Mm-hmm.

264
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,079
<font color="cyan">And when did he do Richardson?</font>
<font color="cyan">Were that top of February?</font>

265
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,959
<font color="yellow">Hmm.</font>
That's right.

266
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,959
<font color="cyan">So, what, that's three months</font>
<font color="cyan">since he left these marks?</font>

267
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,279
<font color="yellow">He might have replaced them.</font>
<font color="yellow">That's what you're saying?</font>

268
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,759
<font color="cyan">Well, no, it's just an observation.</font>

269
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,079
<font color="cyan">But, you know, if he were worried</font>

270
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,119
<font color="cyan">that he'd left these marks</font>
<font color="cyan">in the first place, then...</font>

271
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,399
<font color="yellow">Then he definitely will.</font>

272
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,199
<font color="cyan">Well, you'd imagine, wouldn't you?</font>

273
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Sorry, George.
What are you doing here exactly?

274
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,439
<font color="yellow">He's fresh eyes, Jim.</font>

275
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,199
<font color="yellow">We're hunting a man</font>
<font color="yellow">who's lost all sanity.</font>

276
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,159
<font color="yellow">I want my best men in this room</font>
<font color="yellow">thrashing this out.</font>

277
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,559
<font color="yellow">And it's not just Leeds,</font>
<font color="yellow">is it, John?</font>

278
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,440
<font color="yellow">You've got him doing</font>
<font color="yellow">this whore in Bradford.</font>

279
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,719
<font color="lime">Atkinson.</font>
Yes, but...

280
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,600
is that linked, though?

281
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,039
Well, is that what David Gee says?

282
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,879
<font color="lime">He wants a meeting up at the lab</font>
<font color="lime">to talk it all through.</font>

283
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,240
Does he?

284
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,920
<font color="lime">Tomorrow morning.</font>

285
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,279
Was anybody planning on telling me
about this meeting?

286
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,320
<font color="yellow">Well, that's you being told now,</font>
<font color="yellow">Jim.</font>

287
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,279
<font color="cyan">So that's four.</font>

288
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,759
<font color="cyan">And he's spreading.</font>
<font color="cyan">Outside of Leeds.</font>

289
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,279
<font color="cyan">And it's more often.</font>

290
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,960
<font color="cyan">And the papers are all over it.</font>

291
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,679
<font color="cyan">Might just be</font>
<font color="cyan">"ladies of the street",</font>

292
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,000
<font color="cyan">but it's how it looks, in't it?</font>

293
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,039
<font color="cyan">I mean, come on...</font>

294
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,680
<font color="cyan">"Hundred makes of car."</font>

295
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,639
<font color="cyan">You know what's gonna happen,</font>
<font color="cyan">don't you?</font>

296
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,599
<font color="cyan">If it happens again,</font>
<font color="cyan">your phone is going to ring,</font>

297
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,679
<font color="cyan">and it'll be me saying,</font>
<font color="cyan">"I'm having it." The whole case.</font>

298
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,399
<font color="cyan">Not just a city job now,</font>
<font color="cyan">this affects all of us,</font>

299
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,880
<font color="cyan">the whole of Yorkshire.</font>

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,000

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,880

320
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,440
All right.

321
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,360
Thank you.

323
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,520
SHE EXHALES HEAVILY

324
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,080
I'm going.

325
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,120
<font color="yellow">Why don't you stay for a bit?</font>

326
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,960
No, I mean I'm "going" going.

327
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,039
To London.

328
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,159
SHOUTING
It's not safe!

329
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,760
Not with this bastard about.

330
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,959
She were our friend.

331
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,280
Our mate.

332
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,480
She'll never forgive us.

333
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,760
Come.

334
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,999
<font color="yellow">I can't.</font>
Well, I'll get you a ticket.

335
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,959
<font color="yellow">I've got my boy.</font>
We can take him, too!

336

<font color="yellow">To London?</font>

337
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,639
We'll find a way.

338
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,000
<font color="yellow">There's no way.</font>

339
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,319
Well, why don't he stay
with his dad?

340
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,639
<font color="yellow">Cos he's buggered off</font>
<font color="yellow">back to Dublin.</font>

341
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,720
Listen.

342
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,799
If you stay on the beat,
then that bastard on there...

343
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,359
he'll come for you...

344
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,760
and he'll kill you!

345
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,480
<font color="yellow">He won't.</font>

346
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,599
<font color="yellow">He won't, cos we know now...</font>
<font color="yellow">don't we?</font>

347
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,399
<font color="yellow">We know to be careful.</font>
<font color="yellow">We can watch out for each other.</font>

<font color="yellow">we've been with before.</font>

349
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,240
I need to go home.

350
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,160
<font color="yellow">I'll see you tomorrow night, yeah?</font>

351
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,639
<font color="yellow">Promise we'll chat tomorrow night.</font>
I'll try.

352
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,280
I'll ring you. OK?

353
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,920
See ya.

354
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,000
<font color="cyan">Here y'are.</font>

355
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,600
<font color="yellow">No, please.</font>

356
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,360
<font color="yellow">Not after today.</font>

357
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,559
"One week spent in hospital,

358
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,039
"so unable to claim Social Security
during that time."

359
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,559
That's right, isn't it?

360
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,399
"Ongoing headaches, so unable
to hold down consistent work,"

361
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,440
which I've been able
to corroborate here.

362
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,639
Erm, I've said that that might be
an ongoing problem,

363
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,799
which it might not,

364
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,920
but that'll only help them
take this more seriously.

365
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,040
OK? And if you're happy with that,
you just need to sign the bottom.

366
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,319
And then while you're doing that,
I'll try and find us an envelope.

367
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,960
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Doctor.</font>

368
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,600
New?

369
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,680
<font color="yellow">For the shopping.</font>
Very smart.

370
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,479
Anita.

371
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,760
Where do we keep the envelopes?

372
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,919
<font color="yellow">We were broadly agreed</font>
<font color="yellow">on the injuries.</font>

373
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,319
<font color="yellow">Curved lacerations to the head,</font>
<font color="yellow">puncture wounds to the torso,</font>

374
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,719
<font color="yellow">especially the abdomen.</font>
<font color="yellow">But there are some differences, too.</font>

375
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,679
<font color="yellow">It's not exactly clear</font>

376
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,119
<font color="yellow">whether it was just one weapon</font>
<font color="yellow">or two, for example.</font>

377
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,399
The fact it's indoors.

378
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,439
In Bradford.

379
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,479
<font color="yellow">Well, that's right.</font>

380
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,359
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't seize upon connections</font>
<font color="yellow">in some regards and ignore others.</font>

381
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,719
<font color="yellow">I wasn't convinced that we could</font>
<font color="yellow">eliminate Atkinson from the series,</font>

382
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,039
<font color="yellow">I still had my doubts.</font>

383
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,159
<font color="yellow">And what did it...</font>

384
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,879
<font color="yellow">was the boot print we found</font>
<font color="yellow">at the Emily Jackson scene.</font>

385
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,399
Yep, I know it well.

386
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,839
The size seven.

387
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,359
<font color="yellow">Except that this is NOT</font>
<font color="yellow">the Jackson print.</font>

388
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,239
<font color="yellow">This is a print that was taken from</font>
<font color="yellow">a bed sheet at the Atkinson scene.</font>

389
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,599
<font color="yellow">Also a Wellington boot.</font>

390
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,679
<font color="yellow">Also a Dunlop.</font>

391
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,879
<font color="yellow">Also a seven.</font>

392
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,119

393
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,600
<font color="yellow">Exact same boot.</font>

394
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,000
Exact same man.

395
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,919
<font color="yellow">No. No way on God's earth.</font>
I should never have said anything.

396
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,559
<font color="yellow">You should never have volunteered.</font>

397
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,159
It weren't like that, I were asked.

398
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,759
<font color="yellow">Asked or told?</font>
It's the same thing.

399
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,119
They're the men in charge -
if they're asking, they're telling.

400
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,039
And it's all properly organised.
I'll have a radio. <font color="yellow">Oh, great (!)</font>

401
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,400
And there'll be men and all,
in case anything happens.

402
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,479
This is how it works.

403
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,680
They could've asked anyone, Bob,
but they asked me.

404
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,999
<font color="yellow">So, what, you'll have to...</font>
<font color="yellow">dress up? So...</font>

407
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,399

408
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,759
<font color="yellow">So men can what?</font>
<font color="yellow">Drive by and look at you?</font>

409
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,560
